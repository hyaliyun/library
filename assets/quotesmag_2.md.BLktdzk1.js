It is based on the 1911 novel The Harvester by Gene Stratton-Porter, which had previously been turned into a 1927 silent film of the same title. The film stars Alice Brady, Russell Hardie, Ann Rutherford, Frank Craven, Cora Sue Collins and Emma Dunn. The film was released on April 18, 1936, by Republic Pictures. Plot In rural 1890s Indiana, farmer David Langston, a single man who has focused his time on his work, is pressured to wed the daughter of the wealthy Mrs. Biddle, Thelma. While David's orphaned friend, Ruth Jameson, is in love with him, David ends up accepts Mrs. Biddle's demands and agrees to wed Thelma. After technological advancements make their way to the town, Mrs. Biddle attempts to pressure David to leave his job as a farmer and join her husband, Mr. Biddle, in a career of real estate. However, Mr. Biddle, who is discontented with his current life, cautions David against selling his farm. Meanwhile, Mrs. Biddle, in an effort to secure David's marriage to her daughter, has Ruth's younger sister, Naomi, whom he adores, put into an orphanage. Soon after, Ruth's grandmother, who opposed David's marriage to Thelma, dies, David and Ruth are drawn closer together, making David question his decision, and soon figures out Mrs. Biddle put Naomi in the orphanage. David then publicly confronts Mrs. Biddle, and boldly announces his intentions to adopt Naomi himself. Thelma, infuriated, breaks their engagement, and Ruth, David, and Naomi are reunited, with David deciding to remain a harvester. = Criticisms of the Film = This adaptation of the original 1911 novel by Gene Stratton-Porter features many plot differences, which some claim detract from the overall quality of the film. This is especially true considering how well received the novel was at publication. According to a review published by the New York Times, there \\"has been lost the simple nobility of its central figure that made the book a best seller when it was written.\\" The author of this review, referenced as J.T.M., claims the movie could not be seen as parallel to the vision Stratton-Porter had when writing the novel. The portrayal of the titular figure, David Langston, is seen as \\"a most na√Øve young man, far too easily urged away from his herb patches and the rural destiny that so patently befits him by an extremely transparent plot of feminine scheming.\\" Cast *Alice Brady as Mrs. Biddle *Russell Hardie as David Langston *Ann Rutherford as Ruth Jameson *Frank Craven as Mr. Biddle *Cora Sue Collins as Naomi Jameson *Emma Dunn as Granny Moreland *Joyce Compton as Thelma Biddle *Edward Nugent as Bert Munroe *Roy Atwell as Jake Eben *Spencer Charters as Stubby Pratt *Russell Simpson as Abner Prewett *Phyllis Fraser as Gladys *Fern Emmett as Miss Sophronia *Burr Caruth as Dr. Carey *Lucille Ward as Mrs. Griggs *Harry Bowen as Carl *Grace Hayle as Mrs. Kramer References External links * Category:1936 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American comedy films Category:1936 comedy films Category:Republic Pictures films Category:Films directed by Joseph Santley Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films produced by Nat Levine Category:Films based on works by Gene Stratton-Porter Category:Films based on American novels Category:American film remakes Category:Sound film remakes of silent films ","title":"The Harvester"},{"id":"48388232","text":"The 4th Anti-Aircraft Division (4th AA Division) was an air defence formation of Britain's Territorial Army, created in the period of tension before the outbreak of the Second World War. It defended North West England during the Blitz. Origin Increasing concern during the 1930s about the threat of air attack led to large numbers of units of the part-time Territorial Army (TA) being converted to anti-aircraft (AA) gun and searchlight roles in the Royal Artillery (RA) and Royal Engineers (RE), and higher formations became necessary to control them. One such formation was the 4th AA Division, raised on 1 September 1938 in Western Command, with its headquarters at Chester.Frederick, p. 1047. The first General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Maj-Gen Hugh Martin.Martin at Generals.dk.Robert Palmer, A Concise History of Anti-Aircraft Command (History and Personnel) at British Military History.Farndale, Annex J. The AA Divisions were unlike field formations: they were established to organise training and later exercise operational command in the static conditions of home defence, but relied entirely on the Home Forces commands for logistic support, supplies, and heavy repairs. They came under the operational control of RAF Fighter Command.Routledge, pp. 64‚Äì6. The 4th AA Division was initially responsible for the industrial areas of the North West and West Midlands of England and North and South Wales. At first it consisted of two brigades: the existing Liverpool-based 33rd (Western) AA Brigade transferred from the 2nd AA Division and the newly formed 34th (South Midland) AA Brigade based at Coventry. Shortly afterwards, 44th AA Brigade was formed at Manchester. The division came under the control of Anti-Aircraft Command when that was formed in April 1939. Mobilisation The deterioration in international relations led to a partial mobilisation in June 1939, and a proportion of TA AA units manned their war stations under a rotation system known as 'Couverture'. Full mobilisation of AA Command came in August 1939, ahead of the declaration of war on 3 September 1939. Two new brigades, 53rd (Light) AA Brigade composed of Light AA (LAA) units, and 54th, composed of searchlight units, were in the process of formation in the 4th AA Division as mobilisation proceeded. =Order of Battle= On mobilisation in August 1939, the division was composed as follows:Monthly Army List, May 1939.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. * 33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Brigade ‚Äì HQ at Liverpool ** 70th (3rd West Lancashire) AA Regiment, RA ‚Äì Heavy Anti-Aircraft (HAA) unit formed in 1937 at Aigburth, Liverpool, by conversion of 89th (3rd West Lancashire) Field Brigade, RALitchfield, p. 31. ** 81st AA Regiment, RA ‚Äì HAA unit formed in 1936 at Stalybridge and Stockport by conversion of the 60th (Cheshire & Shropshire) Medium Brigade, RALitchfield, p. 125. ** 93rd AA Regiment, RA ‚Äì new HAA unit raised in 1939 in Birkenhead and ChesterLitchfield, p. 32. ** 38th (The King's Regiment) AA Battalion, RE ‚Äì Searchlight unit formed in 1936 at Liverpool by conversion of the 6th (Rifles) Battalion King's Regiment (Liverpool)38 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45 Litchfield, p. 132. ** 4th Battalion, The Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) (62nd Searchlight Regiment) ‚Äì infantry battalion based at Preston converted into a searchlight unit in 193862 S/L at RA 39‚Äì45 Litchfield, p. 134. ** 33rd AA Brigade Company Royal Army Service Corps * 34th (South Midland) Anti-Aircraft Brigade ‚Äì HQ at Coventry ** 69th (Royal Warwickshire Regiment) AA Regiment, RA ‚Äì HAA unit formed at Birmingham in 1936 by conversion of the 6th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire RegimentLitchfield, p. 242. ** 73rd AA Regiment, RA ‚Äì HAA unit raised at Wolverhampton and West Bromwich in 1938 from batteries drawn from the 62nd (North Midland) Field and 51st (Midland) Medium Brigades, RALitchfield, p. 211. ** 95th (Birmingham) AA Regiment, RA ‚Äì newly raised in April 1939, with one battery from the 73rd AA RegimentLitchfield, p. 241. ** 34th AA Brigade Company, RASC * 44th Anti- Aircraft Brigade ‚Äì HQ at Manchester ** 65th (The Manchester Regiment) AA Regiment, RA ‚Äì HAA unit formed at Hulme in 1936 by conversion of the 6th/7th Battalion.

The HAA guns were deployed in the defended areas as follows:Routledge, Table LIX p. 377. * Liverpool ‚Äì 19 (plus 3 out of action) * Manchester ‚Äì 12 (plus 10 out of action) * Birmingham ‚Äì 20 (plus 4 out of action) * Coventry ‚Äì12 * Cardiff ‚Äì 6 (plus 2 out of action) * Newport ‚Äì 4 Phoney War During the period of the Phoney War, the AA defences of NW England were not tested in action, and the time was spent in equipping and training the TA units. AA Command also had to provide equipment and units to the British Expeditionary Force assembling in France.Routledge, p. 373. From the 4th AA Division, the 73rd AA Regiment went to France in November 1939 where it joined the 12th Anti-Aircraft Brigade providing AA cover for the airfields of the RAF's Advanced Air Striking Force. In January 1940, Maj-Gen Martin went to command the AA defences of the BEF.Routledge, Table XVII, p. 125.Farndale, Annex A, p. 236.Ellis, Appendix I. He was replaced by Maj-Gen Charles Cadell, recently returned from commanding the AA defences of Malaya.Cadell at Generals.dk. Battle of Britain In the summer of 1940, all AA units equipped with 3-inch or heavier guns were designated as Heavy AA (HAA) regiments to distinguish them from the newer LAA units. Also, in August the AA battalions were transferred from the RE to the RA, which designated them searchlight regiments. =Deployment= At the start of the Battle of Britain, in July 1940, the 4th AA Division's guns were deployed as follows:Farndale, p. 106. * Liverpool ‚Äì 52 * Manchester ‚Äì 20 * Crewe ‚Äì 8 * Birmingham ‚Äì 64 * Coventry ‚Äì 44 * RAF Ringway ‚Äì 4 * Vital Points ‚Äì 52 (mainly LAA) Reorganisation In September 1940, the 4th AA Division formed the 4th AA Z Regiment to command the new short-range rocket weapons known as Z Batteries. Also in September 1940, RAF Fighter Command created a new HQ (No. 9 Group RAF) to cover NW England, and henceforth the 4th AA Division cooperated with it.Routledge, p. 382. As the Battle of Britain fought over southern England in the summer of 1940 developed into the night bombing of the Blitz in the autumn, AA Command continued to expand. In November a new division was formed by splitting the 34th and 54th AA Brigades off from the 4th AA Division to create the 11th AA Division, which took over responsibility for the West Midlands, while the 9th AA Division took over South Wales. At the same time, the 4th AA Division came under the control of a newly formed II AA Corps.Farndale, Annex D, pp. 259‚Äì60. The Blitz Victoria Monument in foreground, the burned-out shell of the Custom House in middle distance Another panoramic view, looking towards the River Mersey The cities of NW England were heavily bombed during the winter of 1940‚Äì41 (the Liverpool Blitz and Manchester Blitz) and 'the actions fought [by the AA batteries] were as violent, dangerous and prolonged as any in the field'.Routledge, p. 395. 'On an HAA 4.5-inch position of 44th AA Brigade in Manchester, the power rammer on one gun failed. One Gunner loaded 127 of the 86-lb [40 kg] rounds himself in eleven hours of action, despite injuries to his fingers'. The wide Mersey Estuary left a gap in the Liverpool defences that could not be fully covered by AA guns, and by mid-1941 AA Command had begun constructing three Maunsell Forts in the estuary on which to mount AA guns.Routedge, p. 395. =Order of Battle= During the winter of 1940‚Äì41, the division was composed as follows:4 AA Div at RA 39‚Äì45 Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396. * 33rd AA Brigade ‚Äì Liverpool ** 103th HAA Regiment, RA ‚Äì formed May 1940103 HAA at RA 39‚Äì45 ** 106th HAA Regiment, RA ‚Äì formed August 1940106 HAA at RA 39‚Äì45 ** 33rd LAA Regiment, RA ‚Äì as above ** 42nd LAA Regiment, RA ‚Äì formed November 193942 LAA at RA 39‚Äì45 ** 65th LAA Regiment, RA (part) ‚Äì formed November 1940 Firefighters putting out a blaze at a bomb site in Manchester city centre * 44th AA Brigade ‚Äì Manchester ** 98th HAA Regiment, RA ‚Äì formed 1939Litchfield, p. 86. ** 115th HAA Regiment, R ‚Äì formed November 1940 ** 54th (Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders) LAA Regiment, RA ‚Äì formed 1938 by conversion of 9th (Dumbartonshire) Bn, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders54 LAA at RA 39‚Äì45 Litchfield, p. 281. ** 76th LAA Regiment, RA ‚Äì formed February 1941 * 53rd AA Brigade ‚Äì North Midlands ** 39th (Lancashire Fusiliers) S/L Regiment, RA ‚Äì as above ** 62nd (The Loyals) S/L Regiment, RA ‚Äì as above ** 71st (East Lancashire) S/L Regiment, RA ‚Äì as above ** 92nd S/L Regiment, RA ‚Äì formed May 1941 * 4th AA Z Regiment, RA ‚Äì as above * 13th AA Z Regiment, RA ‚Äì 'formed August 1941 The night raids continued into the following Spring, during which period Liverpool and its docks along the Mersey became the most heavily bombed area of Britain outside London, with particularly heavy attacks in December 1940 (the Christmas Blitz); in April 1941; and again the following month (the May Blitz).Routledge, pp. 394‚Äì5. Mid-War The main Blitz ended in May 1941, but occasional raids continued on Manchester and Liverpool. Newly formed AA units joined the division, the HAA units increasingly being 'mixed' ones into which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated. At the same time, experienced units were posted away for service overseas. This led to a continual turnover of units, which accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for Operation Torch and the need to transfer AA units from North West England to counter the Baedeker Blitz and the Luftwaffe's hit-and-run attacks against South Coast towns.Routldge, pp. 399‚Äì404. =Order of Battle 1941‚Äì42= During this period the division was composed as follows:Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Farndale, Annex M. * 33rd AA Brigade ** 1st HAA Rgt ‚Äì Regular regiment, transferred from 1st AA Brigade at Crewe;

Dressel died in the concentration camp at Dachau. His was one of the first concentration camp deaths to be widely reported after the Nazis took power in Germany, although differences of interpretation persisted over whether he had committed suicide in the concentration camp, as stated on his death certificate, or was \\"beaten to death\\", as baldly reported in an English newspaper as early as 1934. Life =Early years= Friedrich Georg Robert Dressel was born in Welsberg, close to Coburg in northern Bavaria, and grew up in nearby Schottenstein. He was the eldest son of a carpenter in the village, and after attending school locally he learned his father's trade. Directly before the war he embarked on a period of itinerant work, during which he worked for the Krupp steel conglomerate in Essen. Between 1914 and 1918 he had to participate in the fighting, serving in both France and Russia. He suffered serious injury, however, which led to a lengthy stay in hospital, after which he became a munitions worker in Munich. Dressel also, in 1916, married his partner Dorothea (Dora). Their son, also called Fritz, had been born on 26 August 1914. The end of the war found the family living in a tiny apartment in Freimann, which was part of the north Munich suburb of Schwabing. Freimann was also the location of the munitions factory, recently opened as a branch operation by Krupp, where Dressel was still working in 1918. =Politics= During the revolutionary year that followed the war Fritz Dressel attended a succession of political meetings locally, eventually himself hesitantly addressing a workers' meeting in Schwabing. In 1919 he joined the newly formed German Communist Party, becoming a party organiser for South Bavaria. Dressel was away from Munich, visiting his parents in the north of Bavaria, when Eisner was assassinated in February 1919, and he missed out on the subsequent street violence which involved the killings of hundreds of socialists, communists and trades unionists. His political involvement nevertheless intensified, which led to frequent encounters with the ultra- conservative Bavarian police and justice services. In March 1921 he received a two-year prison sentence after organising a rally in Munich to protest against the life sentence recently conferred on the communist leader Max Hoelz. However, Dressel was released and placed on probation after serving fifteen months of his two-year sentence. In November 1923 the German Communist Party was briefly declared illegal and Dressel relocated temporarily to Berlin where he continued his party activities. By January 1924 he was in Frankfurt where he was arrested and imprisoned for eight weeks. He was arrested again in September 1924 after attending a meeting at which a fellow party member reported on a recent visit to the Soviet Union. The Communist Party was no longer banned in Germany, however, and after a few days he was released for lack of evidence against him. In 1925 he returned to work as the party secretary of the South Bavarian district Communist Party, which for a time he led. During this period he also served as an officer of the Wood Workers' Union and became involved with the consumer-co-operative movement. In 1927 he attended a training course at the Communist Party Academy in Hohnstein, a short distance to the east of Dresden. Between 1928 and 1933 he sat as a member of the Bavarian Regional Parliament (Landtag), leading the small Communist group in it. In March 1929 Fritz Dressel and organised a protest demonstration by Munich's unemployed workers. His parliamentary immunity was lifted and he was sentenced to several months of detention. =Nazi Germany= R√©gime change came in January 1933 and the new government lost little time in establishing one-party dictatorship in Germany. A couple of weeks later, on 9 February 1933, Fritz Dressel made a speech in the Bavarian Landtag in which he was highly critical of the government's newly introduced labour service obligation (Arbeitsdienstpflicht). Presciently, and using chilling language, he predicted that this was part of a step by step strategy to militarize the young people affected. In April 1933 Dressel held a meeting with the local gauleiter, Adolf Wagner in order to protest about the terror being inflicted by the Nazi party's quasi-military wing, the so-called SA. For Dressel the conversation had a personal aspect since his wife Dora had been taken into \\"protective custody\\" on 30 March 1933. Fritz Dressel himself was arrested by the Bavarian police on 3 May 1933 and taken to the concentration camp at Dachau. His political career made Dressel a high-profile opponent of the r√©gime and his detention was reported prominently in the \\"Feldmochinger Zeitung\\" (local newspaper).‚ÄûAm Mittwoch wurde nun auch der Landtagsabgeordnete Dressel der KPD in Schutzhaft genommen. Nun hat man alle, die etwas zu sagen hatten, bis auf Holn Hans, aber auch dieser wird nicht mehr lange seine Freiheit genie√üen, denn viele Hunde sind des Hasens Tod. Dann, wenn sie in Schutzhaft beisammensitzen, haben sie Zeit und Gelegenheit nachzudenken, √ºber das herrliche Sowjetparadies, das sie unseren Erwerbslosen in den pr√§chtigsten Farben schilderten, obwohl sie wissen mu√üten, da√ü dies ein Verbrechen ist, denn in Ru√üland gibt es kein Paradies, dort gibt es nur Not, und diese Zust√§nde wollten diese Herren, vielleicht nur, um dabei im Tr√ºben fischen zu k√∂nnnen.‚Äú \\"On Wednesday the Communist Landtag deputy Dressel was also taken into protective custody. Now we've got all those who had something to say apart from Holn Hans, and he will not enjoy his freedom for much longer: there are plenty of hounds to kill that hare. Then, when they are all in protective custody, they will have the time and opportunity to contemplate their glorious Soviet paradise, while painting our own unemployed in the most unflattering colours, although they must know that this is a crime. In Russia there is no paradise, but only hunger and deprivation, and maybe these gentlemen wish for that condition, only because they love to be able to do their fishing in troubled waters.\\" ...Feldmochinger Zeitung, 6 May 1933 =Dachau= At the concentration camp Dressel was taken to the so-called \\"Arrest building\\" where he was kept separate from the other detainees. Over several days he was repeatedly beaten and subjected to water torture and psychological torture techniques by his SS guards. He made a feeble suicide attempt by cutting his wrists with a bread knife, and his wounds were initially bandaged. Later two SA \\"medical\\" staff, while pretending to provide assistance, removed the bandages after which Dressel was left on the floor slowly bleeding to death while his guards looked on and the camp doctor was forbidden to intervene. According to another version, Dressel was set upon by guard dogs and then left bleeding to death. The guards concluded the evening with a drunken music party. =Report of the death= Although the authorities were content for the death of Fritz Dressel to be reported as a suicide, the more graphic details emerged thanks to a fellow detainee called Hans Beimler. Beimler (who would later die fighting in the Spanish Civil War), escaped from the Concentration Camp on the night of 8/9 May after killing an SS guard and donning the man's uniform. Beimler's report of Dressler's death was included in a publication entitled \\"Im M√∂rderlager Dachau\\" (\\"In the Dachau Murder Camp\\") which Beimler produced in August 1933.

Themes in her work address \\"issues of home, defined locally as domesticity and more broadly as the ways in which we relate to our environment.\\" An early work, \\"Home Invasion [1995],\\" incorporating critical dialogue and audio, is accessible from Leonardo. \\"Domestic space‚Äîformerly inviolable‚Äîis increasingly disrupted by electronic communication of all sorts, including radio, TV, email and the telephone.\\"  Life  Driven by life experiences, Barbier's perspective on home evolved over the years. At one point Barbier dropped out of college to spend a year in France, which was formative in making issues of home, culture and identity central to her work. Years later, a Fulbright lectureship in India with her 3-year-old daughter confirmed the importance of travel in questioning one's conceptions about the world. Barbier once lived outside the city with her family on the edge of a Cook County forest preserve. This close connection to the natural environment, frequently spotting coyote, hawks, waterfowl, songbirds, and deer, made a lasting impression. Over time her focus has moved from an emphasis on the personal to a consideration of the global, looking at ways in which the home has come to be defined more broadly as populations shift, and as our interdependence becomes increasingly clear. In her late work, Barbier re-investigated the ways in which embodiment can facilitate the expression of an idea, calling into question our relationship to the natural world using technology as a metaphor for loss. Loss of material through the destructive process of laser engraving, which removes material through burning, is compared to loss of habitat, loss of entire species, and loss of diversity in our native plants and animals. Barbier's artwork addressing ideas of home and place, in contrast to natural worlds and systems, \\"poetically makes visible a small intersection in civilization that is incredibly complex, and broken\\" and emphasizes \\"vision as metaphor.\\" Professional experience *Professor (retired), Interdisciplinary Arts, Columbia College Chicago, 2012 ‚Äì July 2015 *Chair, Department of Interactive Arts and Media, Columbia College Chicago, August 2005 ‚Äì July 2012 *Director, Center for Art and Technology, Northwestern University, September 1997 ‚Äì June 2005 *Assistant, Associate Professor, Northwestern University, Department of Radio/TV/Film, September 1982 ‚Äì July 2005 Education *School of the Art Institute of Chicago, MFA, sculpture, video, 1975 ‚Äì 1977 *University of Illinois at Chicago, Bachelor's degree, Plastic and Graphic Art, 1972 ‚Äì 1974 Art collaborations In addition to her individual practice Annette Barbier has worked collaboratively through unreal-estates, her long-term collaboration with her partner Drew Browning. Working on several project since the 1970s, unreal-estates continues to probe the potential that new technologies make available, believing that original content arises from a dialogue between an artist and a medium. In addition, this dialogue need not need not be solely between the \\"Artist\\" and the medium; authorship can be extended to the viewer, making her a participant, through instruments like microphones and video cameras, and more recently computers, biofeedback devices, DNA scans, etc. Barbier and Browning have collaborated on many projects including performances, installations, and their daughter, Celine. They have also worked on projects investigating disability and public space. In 2012 unreal-estates and V1b3 (Video in the Built Environment) received a joint grant from Propeller Fund to create a platform for a series of augmented reality [AR] public works.

Biography  Born in 1909 or 1910 in New Julfa, Isfahan. She followed the advice of her sister-in-law, a stage artist, to join theater groups and played bit parts with them touring Abadan, before landing her debut in Samuel Khachikian's The Stroke in 1964, she moved to Tehran and made acquaintance with Khachikian and Arman, and found her way into Armenian show groups. In 1968 Khachikian referred to her another role in The White Hell, which later led to winning character parts in veteran directors' films.

She lay on the banks of the Rhine right next to the space on which now stands the Electoral Palace, Mainz.  History  The castle was built from 1478 to 1481 at the instigation of Diether von Isenburg. Her position suggests that the Archbishop and Elector did not let them build as a defense against strangers, but as a retreat before the citizens of the city of Mainz. The actual location of the electoral residence in the city center, next to the Cathedral, had become uncertain in the Mainz Diocesan Feud. The location of the castle on the banks of the Rhine on the other hand allowed a quick escape to the other residence places Eltville and Aschaffenburg. The arrangement of the trench towards the city favors this thesis. Napoleon finally decided on the end of Martinsburg at the beginning of the 19th century. 1809 the castle was demolished in favor of the bridge and harbor construction.

Samori fought the English and the French to hold on to this empire.  Personal life  Sherif was born in Kolahun, Liberia, in 1973 and spent parts of his youth in Kuwait, where he completed his secondary education. The First Gulf War compelled him to flee Kuwait and settle first in Syria and then in the Netherlands, where he studied law.Vamba Sherif biography at Hope Road Publishing. The Liberian civil war triggered the need in him to explain Liberia to himself, which resulted in his first novel about the founding of the country, published in Dutch under the title Het land van de vaders in 1999, and in English translation as Land of My Fathers in 2016. His second book was The Kingdom of Sebah, published in 2003, followed by Bound to Secrecy in 2006 and The Witness in 2011.

Books  * Land of My Fathers (1999): A novel about the founding of Liberia. Edward Richards, born into slavery in America, leaves for Liberia to join his beloved Charlotte after not having seen her for 20 years. In Liberia, he is confronted with the difficulties the settlers face regarding the people scattered along the coast and the hinterland of Liberia. He decides to head for the hinterland to preach the word of God to the natives. There he meets a remarkable man, Halay. When his land is threatened with war and the oracle ordains that a man must sacrifice himself in order to avert an imminent war and ensure a lasting peace, it is Halay who rises up to the challenge. * The Kingdom of Sebah (2003): A Liberian family migrates to Europe to seek their fortune. The family's progress, however, is hampered not by the challenges the new world throws in their path but by the secrets they carry with them. The story is told from the perspective of the son, who is a writer. * Bound to Secrecy (2007): William Mawolo arrives in a small Liberian town with a secret mission: to investigate the mysterious disappearance of the police chief. The locals, however, are far from happy about his presence, and their hostility increases daily, threatening to boil over. At the same time, Mawolo is drawn to the absent chief‚Äôs daughter, Makemeh, who for some reason doesn‚Äôt seem to be too concerned about her missing father. Intrigued, Mawolo decides to stay longer than required and even attempts to take charge of the town. Little by little, he begins to behave like the despotic man whose disappearance he came to investigate. His desire to uncover the town‚Äôs dark secrets puts him in danger. But will his heart rule his head? Bound to Secrecy is an exploration of power and the fear it generates as well as love in all its magical, addictive forms. * The Witness (2011): Onno, a 70-year-old white man, meets and falls in love with a mysterious woman with a past rooted in the Liberian civil war. The novel explores the accuracy of memory, empathy as a theme, and the impact of some of our decisions on our lives. * The Black Napoleon (2015): Zaiwulo is 13 when he leaves his home of Haindi in the forest of present-day Liberia and travels with his father to Musadu, an old city in the savannah in present-day Guinea. He comes to study under Talahat, a great scholar and head of a prosperous and legendary family, the Haidarahs. This family traces its origin to Timbuktu. It is believed that the source of the family wealth and vast knowledge are found in an ancient manuscript that Talahat keeps in his study. What is the content of the manuscript? And why does no one else seem to have read it but Talahat? Zaiwulo feels that there's more to his presence amongst the Haidarahs than his father, who abandons him in Musadu, is willing to let on. Throughout his life he is plagued by that secret and its implications, by the silence on the part of his teacher and everyone else. Zaiwulo‚Äôs story unfolds in a period that was largely determined by the will of a single man, Samori Toure. Once a trader, Samori became a slave to save his mother and rose up to confront his slave master. Samori became the only leader in Africa who confronted the might of the French and the British in an attempt to hold onto his empire. His campaigns against these powers lasted years, affecting many parts of West Africa, including Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Ghana, and Mali. The French admired Samori so much that they nicknamed him \\"The Black Napoleon\\". Zaiwulo comes in contact with this great man, who takes a liking to him. Samori sees in the child traces of his mother's world. Her family hailed from the forest. To Zaiwulo, Samori embodies freedom, a man who elevates his followers, some of whom were once slaves, to rulers in the greatest African empire in the late 19th century. Zaiwulo follows Samori throughout his campaigns, fighting side by side with him, leading his armies, until the latter is captured and exiled by the French to present-day Gabon. Then Zaiwulo flees the French and returns to the forest, where he hopes to find clues to the secret that had led him to Musadu. What he finds has far-reaching consequences on his life.

Ted Striphas is an assistant professor in the Department of Communication and Culture and adjunct professor of American Studies and Cultural Studies at Indiana University. In this book, the author talks about the history of books and reading, and discusses the contemporary world of book culture. The author mentions the different phases of production and propagation of books. According to Striphas, printing productions are still a part of our everyday lives. \\"With examples from trade journals, news media, films, advertisements, and a host of other commercial and scholarly materials, Striphas tells a story of modern publishing that proves, even in a rapidly digitizing world, books are anything but dead.\\"  Description  Striphas presents some trends and events that are taking place in the contemporary book and printing industry. \\"From the rise of retail superstores to Oprah's phenomenal reach, Striphas tracks the methods through which the book industry has adapted (or has failed to adapt) to rapid changes in twentieth-century print culture.\\" However, he also states that because of the advancement of digital technology and e-books, the printing and bookbinding industries, according to him, are in danger. According to Columbia University Press, The Late Age of Print is somewhat an antidote for the statements that say the end of the book is near. Ted Striphas goes deep into the book culture and shows the definition and the meaning of books beyond reading, printing and archiving.

As a two-year-old she showed very promising form, winning two of her three races including the Fillies' Mile. In the following year she was campaigned exclusively at Group One level and emerged as a top-class middle- distance performer and stayer. She finished second in The Oaks and third in the Irish Oaks before recording her biggest success in the Yorkshire Oaks. She finished third when matched against male opposition and made favourite for the St Leger before ending her career by finishing sixth in the Champion Stakes. She had little success as a dam of winners. Background Untold was a \\"robust, well-made, quite attractive\\" chestnut mare with a large white star and four white socks bred by her owner Robert Cowell at his Chevington Stud in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was one of the most successful horses sired by Final Straw whose wins included the Champagne Stakes, July Stakes and Greenham Stakes. Untold's dam Unsuspected was a successful racemare who won eight races between 1974 and 1976. As a broodmare she produced several other winners including Shoot Clear (Waterford Candelabra Stakes), Sally Brown (Yorkshire Oaks) and Mohican Girl (Gala Stakes). She lived until the exceptionally advanced age (for a Thoroughbred) of 36, dying in June 2008. The filly was sent into training with Michael Stoute at the Beech Hurst stable in Newmarket. Racing career =1985: two-year-old season= After finishing unplaced on her racecourse debut Untold won a seven furlong maiden race at Yarmouth Racecourse in August. Later that month she was assigned top weight of 133 pounds in a nursery handicap over one mile at Sandown Park Racecourse. She struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight but finished strongly to win by a head from the colt Hills Bid. Untold was then moved up in class and started 6/4 favourite for the Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse in September in which she was ridden by Walter Swinburn. Her main rivals appeared to be Tender Loving Care and Moonlight Lady (second and third in the May Hill Stakes) and the Waterford Candelabra Stakes runner-up Meteoric. After taking the lead early in the straight she got the better of a sustained struggle with Moonlight Lady to win by half a length, with the pair finishing three lengths clear of Sue Grundy in third place. =1986: three-year-old season= Untold sustained a minor training setback in the spring of 1986 and did not appear on the track until 7 June when she was one of fifteen fillies to contest the 208th running of the Oaks Stakes at Epsom Downs Racecourse. She started a 20/1 outsider in a fifteen-runner field headed by the 1000 Guineas winner Midway Lady. Swinburn opted to ride the Stoute stable's more fancied runner Maysoon (winner of the Fred Darling Stakes and runner-up in the 1000 Guineas) leaving Paul Eddery to take the ride on Untold whilst Brian Rouse rode the stable's other runner Colorspin. Untold took the lead early in the straight and maintained her advantage until the final furlong when she was overtaken and beaten a length into second place by Midway Lady, with Maysoon and Colorspin in third and fourth. Following the race the filly was bought privately by Sheikh Mohammed. Untold was then sent to Ireland for the Irish Oaks at the Curragh on 12 July and started 8/11 favourite against seven opponents. Swinburn chose to ride her in preference to Colorspin, but again made the wrong decision, as Untold appeared unsuited by the soft ground and finished a distant third behind her stablemate and the Irish filly Fleur Royale. On 19 August Untold was one of eleven fillies to contest the Yorkshire Oaks on good to firm ground at York Racecourse. Once again, Swinburn had to make a choice between the Stoute stable's runners and decided to partner Colorspin, whilst Greville Starkey took the ride on Untold. Colorspin started favourite ahead of Gull Nook (Ribblesdale Stakes and Park Express (Lancashire Oaks, Nassau Stakes) with Untold next in the betting on 5/1. The other contenders included Fleur Royale, Queen Helen (later to win the St Simon Stakes), Gesedeh Pretty Polly Stakes), Ivor's Image (Oaks d'Italia) and Rejuvenate (Musidora Stakes). After chasing the leaders, Untold wore down the leader Park Express in the last quarter mile to win by three quarters of a length with Ivor's Image taking third ahead of Colorspin. The St Leger Stakes at Doncaster Racecourse on 13 September saw Untold, ridden by Swinburn, take on seven colts in the final Classic of the British season. She was made the 5/2 favourite ahead of the Gordon Stakes winner Allez Milord and King George V Stakes winner Moon Madness. She briefly struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight and despite making some progress in the closing stages she never looked likely to win, finishing third behind Moon Madness and Celestial Storm. In October she was brought back in distance for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket but failed to show her best form on rain-softened ground and finished sixth of the eleven runners behind Triptych. Assessment In 1985 the independent Timeform organisation gave Untold a rating of 112 p (the \\"p\\" indicating that she was expected to make more than usual improvement) twelve pounds behind their best juvenile filly Femme Elite. In the official International Classification she was rated ten pounds inferior to the top- rated two-year-old filly Baiser Vole. In their annual Racehorses of 1985, Timeform stated that she \\"would certainly be on our short list for the Oaks\\". In the International Classification for 1986 she was rated the third best filly in Europe over 11 furlongs+ behind Darara and Midway Lady. Timeform rated her on 124, five pounds behind their best three-year-old fillies Darara and Sonic Lady. In Racehorses of 1986 they described her as \\"thoroughly genuine\\". Breeding record Untold was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Sheikh Mohammed's Darley Stud. None of her foals won major races and many never made it to the racecourse. Untold died in 2005. Her known foals include: *Unfold, a chestnut filly, foaled in 1988, sired by Kris. Unraced. *Crystal City, chestnut filly, 1990, by Kris. Won one race in four starts as a three-year-old. *Sunningwell, bay filly, 1991, by Sadler's Wells. Unraced. *Muffle, bay filly, 1992, by Sadler's Wells.

As an author, he has been collected by libraries. Research Carter's investigations were focussed upon the histology of the wool fibre, its embryonic development and the genetic and environmental factors that caused variability in wool quality. His aim was to establish the necessary scientific knowledge by which the economic value of the Merino could be improved. Through this work he conceived the idea of an Australian national Sheep and Wool laboratory. In the early 1940s he drafted a plan for such laboratories which he developed in discussion with his senior colleagues Lionel B.

The novel takes place in one day, 10 October, in an apartment building on St. Hanshaugen in Oslo. The novel describes the life of the inhabitants. It is, according to the Norwegian literary historian Philip HoumNorges litteratur fra 1914 til 1950-√•rene. inspired by the American writer Elmer Rice's Street Scene in the use of time and place unit. Houm writes that \\"form suited to the task Hoel had undertaken.

Early life Cheng was born on 1 December 1936 in Tainan when Taiwan was part of the Empire of Japan. He was the third of seven children, and his father was a wholesale fruit distributor. In 1955, Cheng entered the National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) as an architecture student. While enrolled at NCKU, he was offered an application to join the Kuomintang (KMT) ruling party, but chose not to join, stating that he thought it was unfair that economic benefits were disproportionately distributed to party members. After graduating and fulfilling his compulsory military service, he returned to NCKU in 1960 as a teaching assistant. However, since he was not a KMT member, the school could not continue to employ him and he was dismissed after two weeks. He left Tainan and started work as a teaching assistant in the recently formed Chung Yuan Christian College of Science and Engineering Department of Architecture instead, leaving in 1962 to study in the United States. Cheng enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University in the fall of 1962, where he encountered other Taiwan-born students advocating for independence. He was also influenced by the simultaneous Civil Rights Movement in the United States, attending the March on Washington in 1963. Cheng joined the United Formosans for Independence, predecessor to the World United Formosans for Independence (WUFI) later that year. While in Pittsburgh, Cheng met, and in 1964 married Huang Ching-mei (), who was enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh. Her brother, Peter Huang would also enroll at the University of Pittsburgh in 1964, studying journalism. By that time, Cheng and his family were moving while he was finding a job, finally settling in 1965 near New York City working for Marcel Breuer. 1970 assassination attempt Cheng, then the secretary-general of WUFI, had conceived and organized the plot along with his brother-in-law Peter Huang, Cheng's wife Huang Ching-mei, and WUFI member Lai Wen-hsiung (). On , Cheng and Huang carried out the attempted assassination. Although Cheng intended to be the assassin, Huang volunteered in consideration of Cheng's wife and children. While Cheng was handing out pamphlets and shouting as a distraction, Huang approached Chiang with a gun at the Plaza Hotel, but a Diplomatic Security Service special agent pushed him out of the way, causing the bullet to strike the hotel's revolving doors. Cheng hurried to Huang's side once the gun was fired, and both men were arrested. WUFI later issued a statement disclaiming involvement. Huang pleaded guilty in a 1971 trial to charges of attempted murder and illegal possession of a firearm, but was granted bail before sentencing, and fled the United States. Cheng pleaded innocent to attempted murder, but was convicted after a WUFI colleague testified he had given the weapon to Cheng. Cheng designed the 228 Massacre Monument while imprisoned for illegal entry Cheng also jumped bail in 1971 just before his conviction, fleeing to Sweden for asylum, but was extradited to the US a year later in 1972. Cheng fought the extradition attempt with a hunger strike, but was loaded while characterized as \\"semi-conscious\\" on the flight from Stockholm to New York. That flight was diverted to Copenhagen when the plane developed mechanical issues, and Cheng was taken to the hospital after falling unconscious to receive intravenous fluids. After a second flight from Copenhagen to London, Cheng again fell unconscious, where he was taken, foaming at the mouth, to the health center in Heathrow Airport. He was later moved to a prison hospital. Cheng applied for a writ of habeas corpus while he was detained in the United Kingdom, but this was refused in 1972 and an appeal was denied in 1973. Upon returning to the United States, Cheng was sentenced to up to five years in prison and spent 22 months in jail. After 1973 Cheng was released from prison at the end of 1974 and returned to Sweden, living there for more than eight years, and later lived in Canada for eight more years. He divorced his first wife and remarried Ellen Wu () in the 1970s while living in exile in Sweden. Cheng returned to Taiwan in June 1991 to attend his father's funeral. He later served an additional year-long prison term starting in November 1992 for illegally entering Taiwan without an entry visa, in violation of the 1987 National Security Law.

XD or DP) is a liberal political party in Somalia. It developed from the tradition of socially conservative Islamism, but has officially abandoned this ideology in favour of \\"conservative democracy\\". Well known members of the party include the former Minister of Interior Abdilqadir Ali Omar, Abdikarim Hussein Jama former Minister of Information and current rector of City University Mogadishu. Hassan Moalim is the Chairman of the party. The party's General Secretary Ahmed Moalim Fiqi is a former Somali ambassador to Sudan and served as the Director of Somalia's National Intelligence and Security Agency. Founding Daljir party was initially a loose association of like minded individuals that announced a common political platform In 2012 in a ceremony attended by politicians, academics, members of the then transitional federal parliament, Ministers and Islamic Scholars. It was relaunched on December 1 2014 after a two-week conference attended by Somalis from all regions of the country. In the words of the current Secretary General who was a founding member of the party some of the \\"objectives of its establishment was to lay the foundation for a system that is beyond the failed tribal-based politics that is prevalent currently.'  National Leadership  286x286pxThe National leadership was elected in the inaugural party conference with a minimum quota of 30% of positions being reserved for female members of the party.

The party has two Deputy Chairs; Mr.Hassan Ibrahim who resigned his position as head of the FAO humanitarian response coordinator in the Syrian Civil War to take up this position and Dr. Hanna Abbas a medical graduate of the African International University of Khartoum Sudan. The Secretary General of the party is Amb. Ahmed Moalim Fiqi, a seasoned diplomat and security expert who served as Director General of the National Intelligence and Security Agency and Presidential Candidate for the Galmudug State of Somalia. Prior to this, he served as Ambassador to the Sudan from 2010-2011.

Ms. Hamdi Bilan Musse was appointed the interim chair-lady of the Women's league of Daljir Party.  Ideology  The platform of Daljir party was broadly developed by individuals who were initially part of the loosely organised Tajamuc which was formed by the late Sheikh Mohamed Moalim Hassan (the father of Islamic revivalism in Somalia) and his supporters. The party is described to be socially centrist and advocates a strong role for the state in regulating the free-market economy of Somalia so as to reduce the effects of adverse business practices and create a conducive environment for investment and the large scale reconstruction required to take place in Somalia after the two decades of civil war. The party closely espouses a platform of conservative democracy that is tailored to the cultural and political realities of Somalia as well as a Western-oriented Foreign Policy. Daljir also rejects radical Islamism as a form of governance appropriate for Somalia and is a member of both the Somali Parties Forum uniting 14 Political Parties, and is a constituent member of the Forum for Unity and Democracy, which are broad based coalitions united to strengthen the democratic parliamentary system of the Federal Republic of Somalia and which are committed to peace and stability. Daljir is more liberal than Islamist parties in some other countries. For example, they recognize democracy, pluralism, tolerance of other religions, and women's rights as key to Somalia's development process and they do not support extreme revolutionary movements or any kind of Muslim extremism and terror groups such as ISIS. The party is believed to have very strong anti-Ethiopian policy, stating that Ethiopia's meddling in Somali affairs is a primary reason for Somalia's continued strife. The Heritage Institute for Policy Studies is widely believed to be an arena for members of Daljir party to develop policy proposals and political platforms, serving as a political think-tank for the party. Both the former director of Heritage Institute for Policy Studies Abdirahman Aynte and current director Abdirashid Hashi are affiliated to the party.

The ship was built to ply the route between Glasgow, Liverpool, and Chile via Cape Horn, hence the name Star of Chile, but it travelled other routes including to Singapore. Wrecked The ship was wrecked in the Solway Firth on 25 November 1888 while carrying a cargo of steel rails from Whitehaven, Cumbria, to Rosario, Argentina. The ship first became stranded on a bank to the north of the Workington Bank; but floating free it later ran aground on the Robin Rigg Sand on which it became embedded. As the position worsened, and the ship filled with water, the crew sought refuge in the rigging and the first mate drowned after being knocked from the mizzen mast. The rest of the crew were rescued by the Maryport lifeboat which landed them safely there. On 18 and 19 December 1888, the court of enquiry into the wreck found that the master, James Dorward, had misjudged his position. However, the enquiry did not recommend the suspension of his Master mariner certificate in deference to his record, diligence in the performance of his duties in difficult waters, and his ship having been cast off in a less than ideal position by the tug that towed it from Whitehaven.(No. 3689.) \\"ESTRELLA DE CHILE.\\" Board of Trade Wreck Report, 1888.Wreck Report for 'Estrella de Chile', 1888.

Over time, several members of the Vivian family were made knights, baronets and peers. Hereditary titles held by the family include the Vivian barony as well as the Swansea barony. Several other members of the family have also risen to prominence. History The Vivian baronets and barons are a junior branch of the Vivian family of Trewan Hall, St Columb Major, Cornwall, from whom they are descended through John Vivian (1583‚Äì1647) of Trenoweth and Trewan. Around 1800, one of his descendants, John Vivian (1750‚Äì1826) of Truro, became managing partner in the copper works at Penclawdd and Loughor owned by the Cheadle Brasswire Company of Staffordshire, and thus the first of the Vivian family to settle in Swansea. His son John Henry Vivian (1785‚Äì1855) continued and expanded the business, eventually owning copper mining, copper smelting and trading businesses in Swansea (Vivian & Sons), Liverpool, Birmingham and London. Between 1832 and 1855 he sat as Member of Parliament for Swansea District.Burke (1928) His brother Hussey Vivian (1775‚Äì1842) meanwhile pursued a military career in the British cavalry and commanded the 6th Brigade of the Earl of Uxbridge's Cavalry Division in the Battle of Waterloo. General Hussey Vivian was created a Baronet of Truro in the County of Cornwall in 1827, and Baron Vivian, of Glynn and of Truro in the County of Cornwall, in 1841. After John Henry Vivian's death in 1855, his sons Henry, Arthur and Richard continued to run the family business and sit as Members of Parliament for Swansea. Through their enterprises in the area, the Vivian family did much to develop Swansea into a city, in much the same way as the Marquesses of Bute drove the development of Cardiff. Henry Vivian was created a Baronet of Singleton in the Parish of Swansea in the County of Glamorgan in 1882 and Baron Swansea, of Singleton in the County of Glamorgan, in 1893.

Nearby from this site is Agora, Roman Odeon, and the Baths of Argos. The theater is one of the largest architectural developments in Greece and was renovated in ca 120 AD.  Overview of the Site  The Hellenistic theater at Argos is cut into the hillside of the Larisa, with 90 steps up a steep incline, forming a narrow rectilinear cavea. Among the largest theaters in Greece, it held about 20,000 spectators and is divided by two landings into three horizontal sections. Staircases further divide the cavea into four cunei, corresponding to the tribes of Argos.(Psychogiou) British archaeologist Richard Allan Tomlinson describes the positions of the steps as not conforming to any regular plan, and the blocks are consequently of varying sizes. A high wall was erected to prevent unauthorized access into the theatron and may have helped the acoustics, but it is said the sound quality is still very good today. Around 120 CE, both theaters were renovated in the Roman style. It was around this time that the smaller of the theaters was converted to an odeon, and the Hellenistic theater became Greco-Roman. Containing one of only two examples of a circular orchestra, the other is at Epidauros. The Romans constructed a proskenion that covered part of the orchestra with a hyposkenion below it. The cavea doesn't show evidence of renovation so it can be assumed that they remain original. (Lavy)272x272pxAnother notable feature is the Charonian stairway. Actually more like a tunnel, the stairway lead underground from the backstage to the orchestra pit and is presumed to be used to \\"sudden appear\\" among the actors in play. Other reports suggest these tunnels were too short and narrow to operate effectively for actors, especially actors in costume. In 1988, archaeologists revealed a full circle orchestra bounded by stone like the theater of Epidauros. \\"Argos and Epidauros are the only two theaters proven to have this orchestral feature. Architectural Characteristics The Argos theater reflects on the same template other Greek theaters follow. The paradoi is the entrance that directs actors onto the stage or to the orchestra for the chorus. The scaenae frons is the backdrop of the theater. The Argos Theater was composed on a hillside giving a view of the Caicus River behind the performers. 264x264pxThe proscenium in the main stage made entirely out of bricks and is supported by columns. Behind the proscenium is the Skene (theatre) which is where the behind the scenes productions occur. Opposed to other theaters, the Argos Theater skene is not the most luxurious. A tent was used for the space instead, and was assembled when needed. The theater features a bisellium, a seated area designed to occupy honorary leaders.  Cultural Impact  220x220pxConsidered one of the largest ancient Greek theaters, the theater at Argos has a very long history. Evolving from a small archaic theater, at the base of a rocky slope in the ancient city's agora, to a monumental theater holding 20,000 spectators arranged on 83 rows; a pride of Hadrian. It is possible that this theater, and the Roman Odeon, were known by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes. With the Nafplio bay to the south, and the city of Argos as a backdrop, this theater has provided enormous insight on architectural theater developments. The mythological history of the city became a high interest for people to travel to visit Argos. Purpose There is a theory the Argos Theater was developed to hold important and exclusive gatherings. However, it resulted to becoming a universal site to host festivals, meetings, and athletic competitions. = Nemean Games = The Nemean Games is part of the Panhellenic Games collective and it were held every two years and was the catalyst for the development of the Argos Theater. During the classical antiquity era, the Nemean games were held at the Sanctuary of Zeus until a portion of the site was demolished the games had to relocate itself. In 270 BCE, during the Hellenistic period the games migrated to Argos and remained there. The Nemean games became the most remembered and established games out of the four others. The participants of these games were wealthy men, and they competed in the games to test their dexterity and endurance. Greek men were known to be competitive and prideful people and were always up for a challenge to prove who is the strongest and fastest. These events were known to be the influence for the Olympic games. During the c. 3 BC these events transferred from the city of Nemean over to the city of Argos. Eventually these games were held at the Argos Theater as the primary venue. Competitions and gladiator combats were performed as well for men to demonstrate their athletic abilities. A pool was developed into the theater to be able to host aquatic games. Greeks were innovative and created many way to show themselves off. =Music and Drama= The first documented musical performance occurred in c. 700 BCE. The theater was used as a site to display different types of art forms, such as music and acting. In some cases, music and drama performances were held during sporting events and festivals. Greeks were competitive people, so they turned these performances into competitions. Music and drama contests were popular because it allowed citizens to prove who is the most talented amongst them all. The music competitions were typically held during the Nemean games, and would feature musicians or singers for a change of entertainment. Festivals were held at the theater and featured musical and drama performances. The purpose of the festivals was to bring citizens together at the Argos Theater to celebrate Greek life and to worship their Gods. =Political Assembly= The theater also held political gatherings, which is known as Ecclesia. This is a Greek assembly where men are able to emote their ideas to influence each other‚Äôs political opinions and decisions. The Assembly wanted to give people the opportunity to speak their mind, so freedom of speech was vital for the group of participants. Deciding through the democratic system, the assembly would tackle issues such as war, ways to manage their military, or to elect someone as an official political figure. There are standards to attend the assembly events in the Argos Theater. To become a member of the assembly, men must be at the age of 18, and have served in the military for a minimum of two years. The assembly kept themselves to be exclusive amongst other citizens.  Roman Restoration  Emperor Hadrian is a key figure who contributed to rebuilding the city of Argos. Emperor Hadrian documented the construction of the theater from the 2nd BC to the 1st C. AD. There is evidence the Argos Theater required adding, subtracting, and manipulation from what was left. Floor levels shifted in elevation and new buildings were constructed on the east side of the theater. The entrance was known to have five steps, but when the theater was discovered it had six steps. The reconstruction of the Argos Theater was an opportunity for the Greeks to enhance the theater's original design. During the development of the Baths of Argos, the stairs that were once there were recreated into a ramp leading into the theater. These additions and manipulations are concrete evidence of the reconstruction of the Argos Theater.  Discovery  The city of Argos was set on fire during the Greek Revolution against the Ottoman Empire. The French School of Archaeology excavated the Argos Theater and discovered many artifacts including pottery, terracotta figures, Roman sculpture, mosaic, and armor. The school have been researching and seeking for more artifacts for over 100 years. With an excavation that began in 1892, two theaters were unearthed about 100 meters from Argos, in the city's ancient agora. Initially, the smaller of the two theaters was found and dated to the 3rd of 4th century BC.This archaic theater was later converted into an Odeon (building); when population demand required a bigger theater. A larger Hellenistic theater, dated to the late 4th century (Tomlinson), was found just to the North and excavated. These sites are believed to have been buried for 1,400 years before being discovered. City of Argos as seen from atop the diazoma  Notes  * Ashby, Clifford.

Flora and fauna  The Pinnacles reefs consist of a lush fauna of hard, soft and, black corals, fixed sea lilies and sponges. The reef creates a living habitat for a well-developed and diverse fish culture. Snappers and groupers spawn here.The Oceana. 2010. Wildlife of Gulf of Mexico and Vulnerability to Oil (pdf). Retrievced on March 28, 2017 Typical Caribbean reef fishes and Carolinian shelf fishes, along with epipelagic fishes, and a few deep-sea fishes populate the reef. The Pinnacles reefs are currently too deep for reef- building corals to grow, and scientists suggest that these reefs were formed during low sea levels associated with the last ice age.  Environmental concerns  Coral damage at The Pinnacles from the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill is the subject of a new study (2015) conducted by Florida State University and NOAA. The study revealed sick and dying corals due to oil that was sprayed with chemical dispersants which caused it to settle over the reefs. The study also determined a tropical storm that passed over the area during summer 2010 churned up the sea and caused oil to reach the corals. A 2005 National Academy of Sciences report showed that oil mixed with dispersants damaged certain corals' reproduction and deformed their larvae. The study concluded the federal government needed to study more before using massive amounts of dispersants. The Pinnacles is one of nine coral banks and hard-bottom areas stretching from Texas to Florida that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tried in 2008 to get designated a marine sanctuary called Islands in the Stream. This sanctuary would have restricted fishing and oil drilling around the identified reef \\"islands\\", but the plan was put on hold after vehement objections from lawmakers, fishermen and the oil industry.

Political campaigns In the fall of 1994, Jenkins and Burrell ran against each other for the District G seat on the Shreveport City Council. Burrell won that race with 3,659 votes (61.8 percent), compared to Jenkins' 2,263 (38.2 percent). In 2014, Burrell announced on KEEL radio in Shreveport that he would run for mayor of Shreveport to succeed the term-limited Cedric Glover. However, Burrell soon withdrew on the grounds that a prior commitment to his friend, former Mayor Keith Hightower, made it impossible for him to run. Then Hightower, the mayor from 1998 to 2006, decided not to seek a comeback in the office. Jenkins and Patrick C.

Glover, meanwhile, returned in January 2016 to the state House in the District 4 seat which he formerly held. That position was vacated by Representative Patrick Williams.

Today, by supporting community-driven cultural arts and educational programs, they gather community to build a sense of place and belonging. History An insurance salesman and auctioneer named Delmas Wood started the Sandy Spring Museum in 1981 because he thought Sandy Spring's history was gradually being lost as older residents died. Wood wanted a place to preserve antique furniture, farm equipment, photographs, paintings, and documents of the Sandy Spring area. Florence Virginia Barrett Lehman also helped found the museum. The museum was originally located in the basement of a Sandy Spring National Bank branch in Olney. In October 1986, it moved to Tall Timbers, a brick four-story Colonial house that had been the home of Gladys Brooke Tumbleson, who had died earlier that year. Tumbleson descended from the Brooke family, for which nearby Brookeville was named. Tumbleson sold the building to the museum for less than market value. Mary Jane Forman Rice founded the Sandy Spring Museum Garden Club, a group of volunteers who tend to the museum's courtyard garden, in 1992. Helen Bentley, the widow of baseball star Jack Bentley, donated of land on Bentley Road in Sandy Spring to the museum in 1994. The Bentleys' ancestors had lived in Sandy Spring since the late 18th century. Almost the entire cost of the new location was contributed by local donors. The building was designed by local architects Miche Booz and Thomas Bucci. They based the design local 18th century barns and houses in order to make sure it would blend in with the area. The arched walkway was originally planned from the road to the entrance, but it was shortened to save costs. The architects gave a distinctive feel to each room of the building, and Booz called the central courtyard the \\"best room in the museum\\". The museum's new building on Bentley Road opened in 1997, providing more room for the museum's exhibits. Maryland Historical Trust awarded the Educational Excellence Award to Sandy Spring Museum for its interactive exhibit and web site in 2001. In 2007, a addition opened, providing a research library and a collections storage facility for the museum. Exhibits Sandy Spring Museum's exhibits include a replica of a 19th-century classroom, a replica of a blacksmith's shop, a replica of a general store, and a tractor made from a Model T Ford. The museum has archived more than 15,000 artifacts and photographs from the area around Sandy Spring. Some of its collection dates back to 1650. There are temporary exhibitions that rotate quarterly which often focus on art and history or art and current events. The artists featured are frequently but not exclusively local. A windowed gallery displays art by the faculty of Montgomery College. Two new exhibits were designed by locals in 2014. One of the exhibits is about veterans transitioning from life in a combat zone to life as a civilian. Another exhibit recreated an existing exhibit about community gathering spaces.

Overview Satanist Anton Lavey hosts this morbid mondo documentary about death. Sequels The film was followed by two sequels, Death Scenes 2 from 1992 and Death Scenes 3 from 1993. Death Scenes 2 provides an inside look at the history of death, particularly war between the United States and other foreign conflicts. A short introduction of the horrors of war begins with the ideological findings from Ernst Friedrich (1894-1967). Friedrich was a German pacifist who wrote and published a book called War Against War. The film says that in 1924, he founded the National Anti-War Museum in Berlin, where a radical new method of protest was born. To illustrate his point of view on war, Friedrich quickly displayed hundreds of disturbing photographs which fully revealed the hidden horrors of World War One. Next the film settles in a more national concern dealing with death: the mafia and urban gang violence. Going back to the 1920s and into the present day, some notable mentions in this chapter include Murder, Inc. from the 1940s and 50s. Photos of the murders taken place at the gang-run barber shop is shown, including the body of Albert Anastasia (1902-1957), a notorious New York gangster. Another national historic event talked about in the film is acts of political violence, briefly mentioning the 1950 assassination attempt of President Harry S. Truman and the 1954 US Capitol shooting. The film goes into the \\"restless sixties,\\" showing the graphic assassination of John F. Kennedy, both in pictures and in the notorious Zapruder film. With many death- related events that occurred during this period, footage from the deadly \\"Long Hot Summer of 1967\\" riots proved that the sixties were indeed a hard time.

It was built in the 18th century as the seat of the Universit√† of Gozo, and over the years it housed several government departments and also served as a police station and a post office. The building is currently the seat of the Victoria Local Council and the Gozo Regional Committee, and it also houses the culture and information sections of the Ministry for Gozo. History The Banca Giuratale was originally built in 1733 to house the Universit√† of Gozo, the administrative council which had jurisdiction over the islands of Gozo and Comino. The building was designed by the French architect Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion, and was inaugurated by the Governor of Gozo, Pablo Antonio de Viguier. In 1798, the Banca Giuratale served as the headquarters of the rebels during the Gozitan uprising against French occupation. The rebels would eventually establish an independent state known as La Nazione Gozitana, which lasted until 1801. The Universit√† system was abolished by Governor Thomas Maitland in 1819, and the building was subsequently used as a police station, post office, the Public Archives and the Agriculture Department. The building was enlarged to its present form in 1868 or 1875, to a design by Giovanni Bonello. It was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. From 1961 to 1973, the Banca Giuratale was the seat of the Gozo Civic Council. Since 1994, the building has returned to its original role as a city hall, housing the Victoria Local Council. The Banca Giuratale also houses the culture and information sections of the Ministry for Gozo, and since 2009, it has also been the seat of the Gozo Regional Committee. Exhibitions are regularly held at the building. The Banca Giuratale of Gozo along with that of Mdina was depicted on the Lm2 banknote that was in circulation between 1989 and 2007. The fa√ßade of the Banca Giuratale was restored in 2014. Architecture The Banca Giuratale is built in the Baroque style, and it is regarded as one of the finest Baroque buildings in Gozo.

Chan now plays for NRG, having left the Hearthstone team he created, Team Archon. He was Team Liquid's first Hearthstone streamer as well as a commentator for the Hearthstone World Championship. Early life Chan was born in Hong Kong on April 12, 1991. He later moved to Vancouver with his mother when he was in fourth grade, leaving his father behind. There he quickly learned English in his English as a second language (ESL) classes and was introduced to computer games by his cousin. After playing Warcraft III and World of Warcraft, he became a self-described \\"Blizzard fanboy\\". During high school, Chan and his mother moved back to Hong Kong to live with his father. He had to attend international school due to losing most of his Chinese language knowledge during his time in Canada. He later attended University of Waterloo where he studied mathematics. In 2011, his mother died from intestinal cancer, after which he put his studies on hold to move back with his family. Career In 2013, Chan started an office job his uncle introduced him to in Hong Kong. After deeming it \\"boring,\\" he earned his diploma and soon after tutored children in saxophone. He also worked on the board game Scribe's Arena, which he conceptualized in high school. Chan started to stream on Twitch in late 2013 after a friend suggested him to. He considers himself lucky to have queued many of his games into fellow Hearthstone streamer, Artosis. This drew Chan a high of 20,000 concurring viewers. He streams for about four hours Monday through Friday. =Hearthstone= Chan was the first member of Team Liquid's Hearthstone division. In the Blizzard 2014 Stream Awards, Chan won the \\"Best Hearthstone Streamer in 2014\\" award in the poll categories. He came in second place for \\"Most Active Chat\\" and fifth place for \\"Highest Mean Viewership\\" for overall Blizzard games on Twitch. In November 2014, Chan formed Team Archon after leaving Team Liquid. He immediately signed the Blizzcon 2014 November Hearthstone world champion James \\"Firebat\\" Kostesich. Amaz commentated the 2015 Hearthstone World Championship along with his colleagues Kripparrian and Frodan. Chan voice acted some of the Blackrock Mountain expansion cards for Hearthstone's Cantonese and Taiwanese languages. On September 6, 2016 Amaz left Team Archon, which he created, and joined NRG eSports. Amaz produced the Amaz Team League Championships (ATLC), later called \\"the most successful third-party tournament in Hearthstone.\\" On October 31, 2016, Amaz started a Kickstarter for ATLC 2, but cancelled it after two weeks due to insufficient funding. =Magic: The Gathering= Other than Hearthstone, he is also an occasional player and streamer of Magic: The Gathering (and its digital counterparts Magic: The Gathering Online and Magic: The Gathering Arena). On June, 2016, he was given a special invitation by Wizards of the Coast to play in Pro Tour Kyoto 2017. A year later, he was again invited to Pro Tour Minneapolis 2018, also being invited playing an exhibition match celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the game. His team achieved Top 32 finish in main event. While he managed to get into the finals of the exhibition match, only losing to 2017 Hearthstone Global Games winning member Stanislav Cifka (who is the also the winner of Pro Tour Seattle 2012) After the two special invitations in 2017 and 2018, he had been actively participating on both paper and digital Magic events, including two Grand Prix top 8 finishes in the 2018‚Äì19 season (as of May 1, 2019). Currently, he is sponsored by ChannelFireball as a regular streamer and video producer for Magic: The Gathering Arena.

It occurs when holes are created on the ear lobes or cartilage to allow the insertion of decorative ornaments, such as earrings. Ear piercing in children has been around for centuries as part of ritualistic and cultural traditions, but has continued to become a worldwide mainstream fashion statement. Is very common in Nigeria, India, Brazil and Hispanic countries.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-44885213 However, due to the inevitable pain and potential health risks associated with baby ear piercing, many are petitioning to ban the optional procedure with no medical benefits. The incidence of complications of piercing a baby's ears are still unknown, but because of its popularity, many parents and caregivers easily forget that any cosmetic piercing carries inherent dangers and health risks. Petitions In the United States and the United Kingdom, the issue of whether or not parents and primary caregivers should consent to baby ear piercing is currently a hot debate. According to a petition-making website 38 Degrees, Susan Ingram implores the U.K. Minister of State for Children and Families to set a minimum age requirement for ear piercing and make the practice illegal. She claims that pierced ears is equivalent to physical abuse and child cruelty for the fear and pain inflicted. To this day, to pierce or not to pierce a baby's ears, like many other aesthetic decision, is still firmly a parental prerogative. Age Restrictions Age restrictions, although not imposed, are not a result of medical evidence or physical complication, but rather to protect babies from potential risks in piercing their ears too early. Newborn infants have extremely small earlobes and the probability of misplaced piercings and infections would be higher. The immune system is also still developing, therefore creating a wound can open up the opportunity for infections. Infants are unable to consent to having the procedure. By piercing their ears, parents are taking away the child's opportunity to have such a choice. Additionally, pediatricians from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) require parents to wait until their child is at least 6 months old to get their ears pierced. The older the child, the more likely that they will be taking responsibility for keeping their ears clean of infection. Precautions =Medical Ear Piercing= Many times, reputable dermatologists or pediatricians offer medical ear piercing services on a fee- for-service charge. The professional ensures a truly sterile process for sanitation and follow basic safety protocols. Prior to piercing, the area to be punctured is thoroughly clean with an alcohol pad and pierced with a single-use sterile tool from its previously unopened packaging to prevent cross-contamination. Furthermore, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) stated that if the piercing is performed in a sterile environment and is cared for, there is little risk. =Pain Relief= Ear piercing will always be somewhat painful, even if it is over in a matter of seconds. Dermatologists or pediatricians can prescribe a topical numbing with lidocaine derivatives or apply ice to anesthetize and numb the pain receptors in the earlobes to reduce sensation. According to a journal article in Behaviour Research and Therapy, children often under predict their pain on their ears and reported significant procedural pain and anxiety. While these interventions do reduce the brief, painful stimulus, it will not completely diminish or eliminate pain.  Mental Health Risks for Children  Piercings in children have been seen in religious and cultural ceremonies around the world. A national study of students showed that those with a single ear piercing can symbol a badge of identity or a sign of rebellion, leading to further body modification activities, such as more body piercings, tattoos, daring clothing, and extreme hairstyles. This causal relationship is very difficult to prove i.e. girls with piercings were two and a half times more likely than other girls to have used marijuana and to have smoked cigarettes in the past month. Some take this even further and state that ear piercing may lead to more body piercing, which serves as a marker for peer substance abuse, potential problem behavior associated with sexual intercourse, truancy, running away from home, and suicidal ideation. Physical Health Risks for Children =Infections= Redness, swelling, itching, pain, and/or tenderness are all signs of possible infection. The risk of an ear piercing becoming infected is the highest during warm weather and shortly after the piercing has taken place. Case studies show that normal ear piercing infections may develop into serious infections caused by Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus, which are reported at rates of 10-30%. Although rare, there is also a theoretical risk of viral infection with hepatitis B, C, and HIV, if ears are pierced by contaminated tools. Furthermore, infected deep soft tissue and abscess at the site of infection have to be surgically drained or it can lead to ear deformities. =Allergic Reactions= At a recent seminar sponsored by the American Academy of Dermatology, Alexander Fisher of New York University said that metal allergies are activated after a trauma to the skin. Such allergies, with visible symptoms, such as an itchy rash, weeping skin, pain, and in extreme cases, bleeding and pus, are most often caused by exposure to nickel and cobalt. These are common allergens present in quality jewelry as well as in cheap costume jewelry. A baby can easily develop a condition called contact dermatitis from skin contact with material they have become sensitised to. To avoid metal allergies, Fisher recommends that ears be pierced only with stainless steel or titanium needle. =Keloids= Keloids are raised, reddened, fibrous growths that usually occur after surgical procedures or trauma and can cause significant cosmetic deformity. The ear is one of the most common sites of keloid formation, usually associated with the wearing of earrings caused by ear piercing. The scars, which usually take form of an inappropriately hard lump of tissue, are larger than the initial wound. There is still no definite treatment protocol described for keloids due to an incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of its formation. Even if it is surgically removed, keloid recurrence rate ranges from 40-100% of the population.

It is one of the first of Rodin's partial figures known as \\"fragments\\" to be displayed as sculpture in its own right, rather than an incomplete study. History Inspired by fragments of Greek art and incomplete work by Michelangelo, Rodin modeled a small study of a headless, seated woman. Following a scandal in 1877 when Rodin was wrongly accused of casting The Age of Bronze from life, the artist usually preferred to make sculptures that were smaller than life. Rodin's model was one of his favorites, Anna Abruzzesi, one of a pair of sisters he often used. Art critic Georges Grappe dated the sculpture to 1889 and stated without providing a source that it was a study for The Gates of Hell. In 1904, Rodin's assistant Henri Leboss√© created an enlarged plaster version of the work using a machine invented by Achille Collas. This monumental work was displayed as A Figure at the 1905 Salon de la Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts in Paris. At that time, the sculpture was informally known by Rodin's friends and workers as Abruzzesi Seated after the woman who served as the model. It wasn't until 1914 that the work acquired its current name, Cybele, after the fertile Phrygian mother goddess. A bronze cast of the enlarged version was exhibited as Cybele at an exhibition at Grosvenor House in London that year. The ample figure of the sculpture may have suggested the title to Rodin. Copies The statue at Stanford University in 2011 The plaster version displayed at the 1905 Salon is now at the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux. Many bronze casts have been made that are displayed at locations including: * Victoria and Albert Museum, London (This 1914 cast is the only cast made during Rodin's life.) * Mus√©e Rodin, Paris (1981 cast) * Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn, New York (1981 cast) * Iris & B.

There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off- duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs, including a male soldier, who lost both legs and one arm, as well as two other soldiers who lost a leg each. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign in England and the end of the truce with the British Government.

Pabebe wave is a term coined by the Philippine media to describe a gesture where a person imitates the waving movement done by beauty contestants in the Miss Universe pageant. It was popularized by AlDub in the \\"Juan For All, All for Juan\\" segment of the Philippine noontime show Eat Bulaga! A deviation from a beauty-queen wave gesture, it was exchanged between Alden Richards and Maine Mendoza after its initiation by the latter's character, Yaya Dub. Now popular among Filipinos, it also caught the attention of the world through several media platforms. The gesture is similar to an earlier British gesture ‚Äì the royal wave, used to mock the waving of the royal family. History On July 16, 2015, while doing a Dubsmash-inspired bit on the noontime variety show Eat Bulaga!, Yaya Dub caught Richards' attention, which prompted Yaya Dub to let out a smile that she failed to conceal and that was so out of her character as an uptight \\"Yaya\\" (Nanny). Amid teasing from the show's hosts Tito Sotto, Joey de Leon, Vic Sotto, and especially Allan K‚ÄîYaya Dub made a playful hand motion in reciprocation to Richards' greeting. Referred thereafter as the \\"pabebe wave,\\" it is derived from the Filipino slang, pabebe, which means \\"to act cute like a baby.\\" The gesture is made when a hand is curved slightly inwards, with all fingers closed together, in a small side-to-side motion. The gesture was so intriguing that it caught on and was soon imitated by the show's audience. Social and cultural impact After its introduction, the \\"pabebe wave\\" quickly spread and is often used as a gesture of friendly greeting by viewers and non-viewers of the show alike, including local celebrities, politicians, including staff at the US embassy in the Philippines. The trend also went viral online that various international celebrities are shown to be doing the wave, including Vin Diesel, Lifehouse, and Bryan White. Because of the pabebe wave's popularity, international entertainment and news outlets, such as BBC News and The Guardian, even feature the Filipino craze on their programs.

In a 2015 interview, Google commented that RankBrain was the third most important factor in the ranking algorithm along with links and content. , \\"RankBrain was used for less than 15% of queries.\\" The results show that RankBrain produces results that are well within 10% of the Google search engine engineer team. If RankBrain sees a word or phrase it isn‚Äôt familiar with, the machine can make a guess as to what words or phrases might have a similar meaning and filter the result accordingly, making it more effective at handling never-before-seen search queries or keywords. Search queries are sorted into word vectors, also known as ‚Äúdistributed representations,‚Äù which are close to each other in terms of linguistic similarity. RankBrain attempts to map this query into words (entities) or clusters of words that have the best chance of matching it. Therefore, RankBrain attempts to guess what people mean and records the results, which adapts the results to provide better user satisfaction. There are over 200 different ranking factors which make up the ranking algorithm, whose exact functions in the Google algorithm are not fully disclosed. Behind content and links, RankBrain is considered the third most important signal in determining ranking on Google search. Although Google has not admitted to any order of importance, only that RankBrain is one of the three most important of its search ranking signals. When offline, RankBrain is given batches of past searches and learns by matching search results. Studies showed how RankBrain better interpreted the relationships between words. This can include the use of stop words in a search query (‚Äúthe,‚Äù ‚Äúand,‚Äù without,‚Äù etc) words that were historically ignored previously by Google but are sometimes of a major importance to fully understanding the meaning or intent behind a person‚Äôs search query. It‚Äôs also able to parse patterns between searches that are seemingly unconnected, to understand how those searches are similar to each other. Once RankBrain's results are verified by Google's team the system is updated and goes live again. Google has stated that it uses tensor processing unit (TPU) ASICs for processing RankBrain requests. Impact on digital marketing RankBrain has allowed Google to speed up the algorithmic testing it does for keyword categories to attempt to choose the best content for any particular keyword search. This means that old methods of gaming the rankings with false signals are becoming less and less effective and the highest quality content from a human perspective is being ranked higher in Google. RankBrain has helped Hummingbird provide more accurate results because it can learn words and phrases it may not know. It also learns them specifically for the country, as well as language, in which a query is made. So, if one looks up a query with the word boot in it within the United States, one will get information on footwear. However, if the query comes through the UK, then the information could also be in regards to storage spaces in cars.

Born 1949 in a town called Alturas de Canasi with the name Wilfredo Israel Sardinas, he grew up in Havana, Cuba. He gained popularity in the 1970s as a sonero, a singer of the Son cubano style of music. Early influences included music by Beny More. He joined with Los Van Van in 1980 and toured globally with them, before leaving the group and moving to the United States in 1993. Settling in Miami, Florida, he garnered support from Cuban exiles who had moved to Miami, Florida. While in New York City in 1984 he changed his name to Kantor as a reference to cantor, Spanish for singer, at the recommendation of colleague Johnny Pacheco. He recorded albums in the 1980s alongside musicians including: Sal Cuevas, Barry Rogers, Mario Rivera, and Sonny Bravo. His song \\"Ya Estoy Aqu√≠\\" reached the number two top spot amongst popular music on Miami radio in 2002. Kantor joined the group Tropicana All- Stars in 2003, a twenty-piece orchestra band which performed tribute music hearkening back to the style of his early influence Beny More. The group's debut performance was on 18 May 2003 at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. While lead vocalist with the group, they received two Grammy Award nominations and two Latin Grammy Award nominations. Kantor died of cancer in 2006 at his Miami home, survived by his wife. He was featured in the Iv√°n Acosta directed 2005 documentary film C√≥mo se forma una rumba, which examined the influence of Cuban rumba on Cuban music. Early life and career in Cuba Kantor was born with the name Wilfredo Israel Sardinas in 1949 in Alturas de Canasi, a locale in the Western region of Cuba. His birthplace is a town situated roughly equidistant from Matanzas and Havana, Cuba. He spent the majority of his early youth in Havana, the capital city of Cuba. He first became popular in the 1970s, and rose to fame in Cuba as a sonero, a singer of the Son cubano style of music. He started out performing with pianist Meme Sol√≠s, who cultivated his singing skills. He was a fan of music by Ra√∫l Planas and Benny Mor√©; listening to them helped shape his early musical style. He performed with Los Reyes '73, a tribute band to Los Van Van. His peak career in Cuba was during the years of 1979 to 1983. He served as lead vocalist of the group A.C., which stood for After Castro. He linked up with the group Los Van Van in 1980 after they requested he become a member. At the time they were one of the more influential music groups within the genre of music of African Heritage in Cuba. He became the head of their group and became known for his unique signature singing style while performing with them. Kantor traveled with Los Van Van around the globe multiple times performing together with them. In 1983, he left Cuba for the United States, and relocated himself to Miami, Florida. He commented of his education in Cuba: \\"I had great schooling before coming to Los Van Van. [But] I had much restlessness to know the world, and so I decided not to return to Cuba.\\" Move to United States After his move to the United States, Kantor gained significant support amongst Cuban exiles who had moved to Miami, Florida. Latin music singer Dominican Johnny Pacheco recommended he change his from his birth-name to Kantor in reference to cantor meaning singer in Spanish language. He did so in 1984 while in New York City. Throughout the 1980s he recorded multiple music albums in New York; these were subsequently re-released in 2002 and showcased his vocal talents alongside musicians including: Sal Cuevas, Barry Rogers, Mario Rivera, and Sonny Bravo. His career in the United States was not as successful as his prior results in Cuba. He traveled between New York and Miami recording nine albums, and settled permanently in South Florida in 1986. He released the album Un Se√±or Kantor in 1998 produced by Osvaldo Pichaco; the majority of which he composed himself. He was featured as the singer on a 2002 album by Juan Pablo Torres y su Super Son which contained new presentations of their prior songs they had made in Cuba years earlier. His song \\"Ya Estoy Aqu√≠\\" reached the number two top spot amongst popular music on Miami radio in 2002. He served as vocalist on the 2003 Orlando Batista produced album Orquesta Sensaci√≥n, which received praise from Latin Beat Magazine as \\"a dancer's paradise\\". Kantor gained new-found recognition in 2003 with the group Tropicana All-Stars. Their group consisted of an orchestra with twenty members, and he served as their lead singer. Together they released the album Recuerda a Benny Mor√© in 2004, whose lyrics and style hearkened back to a more popular era of Cuban music from the 1950s under singer Beny More during his days performing at the Tropicana Club in Havana, Cuba. The group released a DVD of their live performance 18 May 2003 at the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach, Florida. This was their debut performance, and it received a favorable reception from Latin Beat Magazine: \\"Lead singer Israel Kantor delivers majestically flora beginning to end\\". The group's song \\"Francisco Guayabal\\" reached the top 20 chart amongst highest played musical works on the radio in Los Angeles in 2004. During his time with the Tropicana All-Stars, they received recognition in the form of two Grammy Award nominations and two Latin Grammy Award nominations for their work on albums Tradicion, and Recuerda a Benny Mor√©. Death and legacy He died from cancer on 1 July 2006, and left behind his wife. His death occurred at home, in his residence in the Southwest portion of Miami. Funeral services were held at Caballero Rivero funeral home in Miami, and he was interred 6 July 2006 at Woodland Park Cemetery. Kantor was featured in the Iv√°n Acosta directed 2005 documentary film C√≥mo se forma una rumba.

He was the first male ballet master, dancer, choreographer, producer, as well as the founder of a ballet academy in Iran. Biography Sarkis Djanbazian was born in Armavir, then part of the Russian Empire (now Armenia). As the Encyclopedia Iranica states, from early childhood, Djanbazian took an avid interest in the arts, especially in dance. After graduating from high school, he went to Leningrad (St. Petersburg at the time) to study dance. He graduated from Vaganova Dance Academy of Leningrad on 14 January 1936 and from Lesgaf University with a Masters of Arts degree on 15 November 1936. After graduation, he worked as a principal dancer, choreographer, and artistic director in Kirov Theatre in Leningrad until July 1938. As the Russian Communist government exercised heavy political pressure on Armenians, Djanbazian left Russia for Iran in 1938, settling in Qazvin. There, he decided to found a dance school. However, upon being expelled after this proposal to the city council, he turned himself to the Armenian Church in Qazvin. With allowance of the Church's head priest, he was allowed to hold dance classes on the rooftop of the church, in the same year of 1938.Mary Ellen Snodgrass. The Encyclopedia of World Ballet Rowman & Littlefield, 8 jun. 2015 p 155 Djanbazian left Qazvin for Tehran in 1942. There, he started to give dancing classes in the Armenian Ku≈°e≈° high school after the lessons had ended, initially for some 150 students. His perseverance, energy, and tireless effort made him establish the Tehran Ballet School in 1942 in Tehran. Djanbazian staged many full stage ballets in Iran. As the Encyclopedia Iranica states, these included but are not limited to Alexander Pushkin‚Äôs ‚ÄúFountain of Baghchehsarai‚Äù and ‚ÄúDreams of Hafez,‚Äù and Reinhold Gli√®re‚Äôs ‚ÄúChinese Flower Girl,‚Äù and choreographed shorter ballets such as ‚ÄúJealousy‚Äù (·∏§esƒÅdat), ‚ÄúPersian Miniature‚Äù (MiniƒÅtorhƒÅ-ye IrƒÅni), ‚ÄúAnu≈°,‚Äù as well as several classical and traditional Persian dance pieces including ‚ÄúGol-e gandom,‚Äù ‚ÄúWoodchopper‚Äù (Tabar-zan), ‚ÄúSailors‚Äù (MalavƒÅnƒÅn), ‚ÄúLife and Death‚Äù (Zendegi va marg, widely known as ‚ÄúSnake Dance‚Äù or Raq·π£- mƒÅr), ‚ÄúPrayers in the mountains‚Äù (Raq·π£-e namƒÅz), ‚ÄúQƒÅli-e KermƒÅn,‚Äù and ‚Äú≈†ƒÅlikƒÅri‚Äù. As the Encyclopedia Iranica states, Djanbazian took a great deal of interest in Iranian culture, and tried tirelessly to incorporate Iranian themes and stories in his artistic work. Despite his lack of fluency in Persian, his interest in Persian literature led him, with the collaboration of Ehsan Yarshater, to the production and staging of ‚ÄúRostam and Tahmina‚Äù ballet, based on a love story in the Ferdowsi‚Äôs Shahnameh. Over the course of his career, he collaborated with many artists and intellectuals of the time. He also served, in 1948, as the head of the faculty at the National Guard and Armed Forces Academy (La≈°kar-e gard-e ≈°ƒÅhan≈°ƒÅhi), where he trained high-ranking officials of the country.communication with A. Djanbazian; ‚ÄúDjanbazian Dance Academy,‚Äù ref. no. 5 As the Encyclopedia Iranica lastly states, Djanbazian founded the Folk Dance and Song Ensemble (Goruh-e raq·π£ o ƒÅvƒÅz-e ma·∏•alli) conducted by maestro Edik Hovespian in 1959. Later on, this ensemble continued their performances under the direction of maestro Hovik Gasparian at the second national dance festival in Iran in 1962. Sarkis Djanbazian died of heart attack at the age of fifty on 11 December 1963 in Tehran. His greatest concern was that his school might not continue after his death. The school remained open and instructors such as YagƒÅna ≈†ƒÅygƒÅn,  øAbd-AllƒÅh NƒÅ·∫ìemi, Yerjanik Djanbazian, and Zohra Amjadi taught there until Djanbazian‚Äôs daughter, Anna, returned home after the completion of her dance education in Russia. She took over the academy in 1972 and managed it until 1984, when she left Iran and continued her dance activities in the United States, at the Djanbazian Dance Company in La Crescenta, California. =Personal life= In 1950, Djanbazian married Fleur Djanbazian; they had two children, Anna and Albert Djanbazian. Anna received her education in dance first under her father‚Äôs direction and then continued her training in Russia after her father died.

The book's merits then established, it was republished in England and Australia in 1944.\\" \\"Flesh in Armour : A Novel ‚Äì Leonard Mann\\" Austlit Reviews The novel was initially met with mixed reviews: generally appreciative of the material but critical of the language depicted. A reviewer in Perth's Sunday Times stated: \\"A distinct literary ability is revealed in the scenes in action and in the support lines, which chapters are a masterpiece of descriptive work, but the merit of the story as a whole is spoilt by the sensual episodes and by digger dialogue of the crude and obscene sort, the author apparently overlooking the fact that some of the finest brains of the earth looked at the war through the eyes of infantry privates.\\"\\"Flesh in Armour\\", Sunday Times, 27 November 1932, p12S The Telegraph in Brisbane, however, saw beyond the dialogue to the merits of the novel: \\"Here is the real Aussie, colloquial language and all, scornful of authority, loyal to the backbone whenever the call to action comes, and ready for any devilment in the hours out of the trenches.\\"\\"Current Literature : The Digger is Given a Novel\\" The Telegraph, 24 December 1932, p8 By the end of World War II it was being appreciated as a major piece of Australian war literature with a critic in The Age stating: \\"It pulses with life, that, together with the accuracy of its descriptions, has raised the novel above many others of its kind.

It is located in the village of F√∏resvik. It is the church for the Bokn parish which is part of the Haugaland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Stavanger. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1847 using designs by the architect Hans Linstow. The church seats about 300 people. View of the church History The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1620, but the church was likely built in the 12th century, since that is when the church's baptismal font was made. The first church here was probably a stave church. In 1686, the old stave church was torn down and replaced with a new (small) timber-framed church on the same site. In 1846, the church was again demolished and in 1847 a new church was built on the same site. The church met in a barn on the Laupland farm while the new church was being constructed. In 1933, a new sacristy and choir were added on to the building. In 1950 and again in 1990, the church cemetery was expanded on farmland across the street from the church.

Daguerrotype view of San Francisco harbor in 1850 or 1851. The San Francisco Fire of 1851 (May 3‚Äì4, 1851) was a catastrophic conflagration that destroyed as much as three- quarters of San Francisco, California. History During the height of the California Gold Rush, between December 1849 and June 1851, San Francisco endured a sequence of seven bad fires, of which this was the sixth and by far the most damaging. In terms of property value, it did three times as much damage as the next most destructive of the seven fires. Around 11 pm on the night of May 3, 1851, a fire (possibly arson) broke out in a paint and upholstery store above a hotel on the south side of Portsmouth Square in San Francisco. Fueled by increasingly high winds, the fire was initially carried down Kearny St. and then, as the winds shifted to the south, into the downtown area, where the elevated wood-plank sidewalks provided extra fuel. The fire, which was visible for miles out to sea, continued for about 10 hours and eventually extended to at least 18 blocks of the main business district, an area three-quarters of a mile long by a third of a mile wide. Before it was checked by reaching the waterfront, it burned down some 2000 buildings altogether, amounting by some estimates to three-quarters of the city. One 19th century account of the destruction observes: \\"Nothing remained of the city but the sparsely settled outskirts.\\" The total damage has been estimated at around $10‚Äì12 million, a good deal of it uninsured as no insurance companies had yet been established in the city. Among the properties destroyed that day were the Niantic whaling vessel, which had been run aground to serve as a store and would subsequently be rebuilt as a hotel; a general store founded by Domenico Ghirardelli, who would go on to found the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company; and all half dozen of the city's newspapers apart from Alta Californian. At least nine lives were lost in the fire, some of them in new, supposedly fireproof iron buildings whose doors and shutters expanded with the heat, trapping people inside.

In 1977 her family emigrated to Vienna, a move in which she describes herself as having been ‚Äúuprooted and re-potted.‚Äù  Life  Rabinowich is the daughter of artist and designer Boris Rabinowich (1938‚Äì1988) and artist Nina Werzhbinskaja-Rabinowich who, with their family, emigrated from the Soviet Union to Vienna in December 1977. Rabinowich has a daughter, born in 1995. From 1993-1996 Rabinowich studied at the University of Vienna to become a translator, following which she took additional courses in psychotherapy. Accepted at the University of Applied Arts Vienna in 1998, Rabinowich continued her studies with a focus on Fine Arts (painting) and philosophy, receiving her diploma in 2006. Since 2006 Rabinowich has worked as an interpreter for refugees at the Integrationshaus Wien and the Diakonie Fl√ºchtlingsdienst. Both centres are engaged in welcoming, aiding and integrating asylum seekers, refugees and migrants to Austria. Rabinowich is a regular columnist for Der Standard, contributing weekly columns under the title ‚ÄúGesch√ºttelt, nicht Ger√ºhrt‚Äù (Shaken, not Stirred) since March 2012, wherein she addresses current issues. While Rabinowich thinks that art can but need not be political, much of her own work is written in response to the politics around asylum and the European refugee experience. Despite her frequent use of these themes, she rails against having her literary works categorized as ‚Äúmigration literature,‚Äù finding the term derogatory and ‚Äúdownright racist.‚Äù In describing her relationship between her work as an artist and as an author, Rabinowich says, ‚ÄúI am a very visual person. I write what I see. I used to write with colours, now with words.‚Äù In 2013, Rabinowich moderated an art installation at the Jewish Museum Vienna showcasing the works of her father, Boris Rabinowich. Rabinowich lives and works an author, dramatist and painter in Vienna.  Literary works  In addition to her work as a dramatist and playwright, Rabinowich has written three novels. Her first, Spaltkopf, which draws heavily on her own life, tells the story of Mischka, a seven-year old Jewish √©migr√©, born in Saint Petersburg who, together with her parents and grandmother, moves to Vienna. Mischka's story spans almost thirty years, with the story-telling shared by Spaltkopf (‚ÄúSplithead‚Äù), a Russian fairy-tale monster who feeds off the emotions of his victims. Mischka relates the ordeals of the family's new life in Austria while Splithead discloses the family's past in Russia. Spaltkopf was awarded the prestigious 2009 . In 2011, Spaltkopf was translated by Tess Lewis from the German into English with the title Splithead. Splithead was nominated for the ‚ÄúInternational Impact Dublin Literary Award‚Äù in 2013. Rabinowich's second novel, Herznovelle written in the first person, tells the story of a woman brought by her husband to hospital for heart surgery. The operation is a success, however, the woman is profoundly changed. She becomes obsessed with the surgeon who quite literally touched her heart. With psychological assistance she is able to let go of the infatuation and find her way back to her previous life. The title, Herznovelle, references Arthur Schnitzler's 1925 Traumnovelle. Rabinowich's most current novel, Die Erdfresserin examines themes of origin, the past and European migration through the struggle of Diana who takes on the responsibilities of providing for the family she left behind, her disabled son, overbearing mother and bitter sister. A film director in her homeland, she finds herself working as a prostitute where she meets and nurses an ill policeman until his death. When she learns her son has been admitted to a clinic, she heads back home. = Theater Productions (commissioned works) = * 2007: Nach der Grenze, WUK, Wien * 2008: Romeo + Julia, Schauspielhaus Wien * 2008: Orpheus im Nestroyhof, Theater Nestroyhof Hamakom, Wien * 2009: Fluchtarien.

He led the SMU Mustangs to two Southwest Conference championships. Biography McIlhenny is considered to be one of the greatest option quarterbacks in NCAA Division I-A history. As a freshman, he did not begin the 1980 season as the starter at quarterback, but was promoted during the seventh game against the University of Texas. Future NFL running backs Eric Dickerson and Craig James, combined with blue chip running back Charles Waggoner, were nicknamed the \\"Pony Express\\" for their running attack; with McIlhenny leading the offense. In 1982, he led the Southwest Conference in passing efficiency with a 133 rating. Slocum told Sherrington, McIlhenny ‚Äúunderstood option football. ... He had two great running backs at SMU, but he‚Äôs the one who made it all go‚Äù. In the 1983 Cotton Bowl, number-four-ranked SMU and McIlhenny (a senior), played against the number-six-ranked University of Pittsburgh and Dan Marino in his final game. SMU won, 7-3. McIlhenny is the winningest quarterback in school and Southwest Conference history, finishing with a career record of 34-5-1. He played a key role in the Mustangs two SWC Championships (1981, 1982). As Kevin Sherrington, sports writer for The Dallas Morning News observed in a January 2015 analysis of the 1982 Mustangs, \\"Lance McIlhenny had more than a little to do with the success. He became SMU‚Äôs starting quarterback midway through his freshman year. Not because he was big or fast or could throw a pass through your earhole. What he was, was a mechanic. Nobody south of the Red River ran the option better. He learned it at the foot of Frank Bevers at Highland Park, where R.C. Slocum, then a Texas A&M; assistant, recruited him for the Aggies.\\" In 2013, he was inducted into the SMU Athletics Hall of Fame. Personal life His father Don McIlhenny played in the National Football League. After college, McIlhenny opted not to continue a career in professional sports. He told UPI in 1982, \\"I really don't think I would want to stay in the game as a coach. ... Oh, maybe I might coach my kids or be a YMCA coach. But football takes a lot out of you. It is a grind. I get too wrapped up in it. My mom will be the first to tell you that\\". He worked for several commercial real estate firms in the Dallas area, including Jones Lang LaSalle, The Staubach Company, CASE Commercial Real Estate, Cresa Partners and CBRE, where he was a first vice president.

The team is currently competing in All Elite Wrestling (AEW) where they are the current AEW World Tag Team Champions in their first reign. They are best known for their time in WWE as The Revival, under the ring names Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson, respectively. The team was created by Dusty Rhodes in 2014, then as The Mechanics, and later simply Dash and Dawson when they made their television debut on WWE NXT. The team adopted the name The Revival in 2016, referencing \\"reviving\\" the classic tag team wrestling style of the 1980s, which has led to the two being compared favorably to The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard)‚Äîone of the top teams of the 1980s. The team uses the phrase \\"No flips, just fists\\" to convey their more traditional, mat based in-ring style in contrast to the more high flying style of some contemporary teams. They are the first team to have won all three of WWE's main brand tag team championships‚Äîthe Raw Tag Team Championship (held twice), SmackDown Tag Team Championship (once), and NXT Tag Team Championship (twice), and are recognized by WWE as being the company's first-ever Tag Team Triple Crown Champions. They were also the first two-time NXT Tag Team Champions, and are the only people to have jointly won the WWE 24/7 Championship. After being granted their releases by WWE in April 2020, the duo took the name of FTR, alternately using the letters to mean \\"Fear The Revolt,\\" \\"Fear The Revelation,\\" \\"Follow The Rules,\\" and \\"Fuck The Rest\\" (FTR). They made their AEW debut on the May 27, 2020 episode of Dynamite, winning the AEW World Tag Team Championship the following September. Between WWE and AEW, FTR are six-time tag team champions. History =WWE (2014-2020)= Origins and formation  Wheeler and Harwood were longtime friends before being made into a team, and had wrestled together on the independent circuit. In 2012, Harwood was hired by WWE based in part on a match he previously had with Wheeler, and performed there under the name Scott Dawson, mostly in tag team matches on NXT and live shows. Wheeler had hoped to join WWE, with the two also hoping to form a tag team there. In 2014, Wheeler joined the WWE Performance Center, and on his very first day of promo training, performed a promo with Dawson; WWE producer Dusty Rhodes immediately became convinced that the two needed to become a team. According to a May 2020 interview of the duo, Rhodes was not only highly influential in both the creation and development of the team, but had \\"unwavering faith\\" in them even as some of the other coaches had doubts, and was their \\"biggest supporter and pushed for [them] harder than anybody\\" until his passing in 2015. Wheeler and Harwood, who were both from North Carolina, acknowledged that their southern accents contributed to the lack of faith some coaches had for them at the Performance Center (with WWE chairman Vince McMahon's dislike for southern accents being well-known backstage). They were notably told that they would not get to do many promos, although Rhodes, a fellow resident of North Carolina, insisted that they should. NXT debut (2014‚Äì2015) In 2014, after returning from injury, Dawson teamed up with a debuting Wilder, with the two performing extensively at live events under the ring name The Mechanics.https://www.bodyslam.net/2020/09/25/exclusive-origin-and-reason-wwe- nixed-the-revivals-original-team-name-revealed/ The two made their on-screen debut on the July 17, 2014, episode of NXT, losing to Bull Dempsey and Mojo Rawley. They made only one further televised appearance in 2014, losing to Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady on the October 23 episode of NXT, but continued to wrestle extensively at live events. The duo resurfaced and picked up their first televised win on the July 29, 2015 episode of NXT, defeating Enzo Amore and Colin Cassady. At NXT TakeOver: Respect, The Mechanics were defeated in the semi-finals of the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic by eventual winners Finn B√°lor and Samoa Joe. In the following weeks, the team name was changed to \\"Dash and Dawson\\". On the October 28 episode of NXT, Dash and Dawson would attack Amore and Cassady before their match, completely laying out Amore while decimating Cass' knee, leaving him unable to compete. NXT Tag Team Champions (2015‚Äì2017) NXT Tag Team Champions in 2016 Due to an earlier non-title victory over NXT Tag Team Champions The Vaudevillains, Dash and Dawson earned a title match on the November 11 episode of NXT, and won the match to become the NXT Tag Team Champions for the first time. They made their first successful title defense two weeks later, defeating The Vaudevillians in a rematch. Afterwards, they successfully defended their titles against Amore and Cassady at NXT TakeOver: London. Beginning in February 2016, Dash and Dawson began performing under the team name The Revival. The Revival made their first appearance on WWE's main roster at Roadblock, successfully defending their championships against Amore and Cassady. On April 1 at NXT TakeOver: Dallas, The Revival lost the NXT Tag Team Championship to American Alpha (Chad Gable and Jason Jordan), ending their reign at 142 days. On June 8 at NXT TakeOver: The End, The Revival regained the titles from American Alpha, thus becoming the first team to win the NXT Tag Team Championship twice. On the July 6 episode of NXT, The Revival defeated American Alpha in a two-out-of-three falls match to retain the titles. At NXT TakeOver: Brooklyn II, they retained their titles over Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa. In a rematch against Gargano and Ciampa (now called DIY) at NXT TakeOver: Toronto, The Revival would lose their tag team titles in a two-out-of-three falls match after scoring the first fall via pinfall, ending their second reign at 164 days. The match was later named \\"WWE Match of the Year\\" for 2016. At NXT TakeOver: Orlando, The Revival would lose to The Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) in a triple threat elimination match for the NXT Tag Team Championship that also featured DIY, in what would be their last match in NXT.  Raw Tag Team Champions (2017‚Äì2019)  On the April 3 episode of Raw, The Revival made their main roster debut, defeating The New Day. The following week on Raw, they defeated The New Day once again. On April 14, Wilder subsequently suffered a fractured jaw during a live event, and was estimated to be out for eight weeks, putting the team on a temporary hiatus. On the July 10 episode of Raw, The Revival attacked The Hardy Boyz (Matt and Jeff Hardy) after their match against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, and became embroiled in a three- way feud; however, shortly afterwards, Dawson suffered a ruptured bicep, putting him out of action for an estimated five months. The Revival returned again on the December 18 episode of Raw, defeating Heath Slater and Rhyno. At Raw 25, The Revival lost to Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, marking their first defeat on the main roster. On January 28, 2018 at the Royal Rumble pre- show, The Revival defeated Gallows and Anderson. On SummerSlam pre-show, The Revival lost to The B-Team (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel) in an attempt to become the Raw Tag Team Champions. At Survivor Series, they were part of Team Raw, but lost to Team SmackDown in the 10-on-10 Survivor Series tag team elimination match. The Revival were the final team eliminated in the match. Following this they began a feud against Lucha House Party (Kalisto, Gran Metalik and Lince Dorado) and suffered various losses in handicap matches labeled \\"Lucha House Rules\\".https://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2018-11-26/article/lucha-house-party-def- the-revival-lucha-house-rules-match On the December 17 episode of Raw, The Revival defeated Lucha House Party, The B-Team and Authors of Pain (Akam and Rezar) in a fatal-4-way match, earning a shot at the Raw Tag Team Championship. Throughout the next two weeks, The Revival faced Bobby Roode and Chad Gable for the titles, but Dawson and Wilder were unsuccessful in winning the titles in controversial fashion each time. Shortly after, Dave Meltzer of The Wrestling Observer reported that the duo asked for their release from their WWE contracts. This information was reported following their bout against Lucha House Party on the January 14, 2019 episode of Raw. On the February 11 edition of Raw, The Revival finally defeated Roode and Gable for the titles, marking their first tag team championship win on the main roster. The following two weeks on Raw, The Revival were booked to lose to two different teams from NXT. This string of losses included against DIY and the team of Ricochet and Aleister Black.https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a26400297/wwe-raw-results-nxt- tommaso-ciampa-johnny-gargano-ricochet-aleister-black/https://www.msn.com/en- gb/news/photos/ricochet-and-aleister-black-vs-the-revival-raw-feb-25-2019/vp- BBU5kz5 The team successfully defended their titles against Black and Ricochet and Roode and Gable at Fastlane, when Dawson pinned Gable.https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/triple-threat-raw-tag-team-title- match-official-wwe-fastlane-278566 At WrestleMania 35, The Revival lost their titles to Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder, ending their reign at 55 days. The following night on Raw, The Revival fought Hawkins and Ryder in a rematch, but failed to regain the titles. At The Shield's Final Chapter, The Revival once again unsuccessfully fought Hawkins and Ryder for the tag team championship in a triple threat match also involving Aleister Black and Ricochet. After being drafted to Raw in the Superstar Shake-up, The Usos began a rivalry with Dawson and Wilder where The Usos would repeatedly embarrass The Revival on numerous occasions. On the May 20 episode of Raw, The Revival defeated The Usos. At Super ShowDown, The Revival lost the rematch. On the following episode of Raw, The Revival defeated Hawkins and Ryder, and The Usos in a triple threat tag team match to win the Raw Tag Team Championships for a second time.https://www.wwe.com/videos/zack-ryder-curt-hawkins-vs-the-usos-vs-the- revival-%E2%80%93-raw-tag-team-championship-triple-threat The Revival defeated The Usos at Extreme Rules to retain the tag titles. On July 29 episode of Raw, they lost the titles to Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in a triple threat match that also involved the Usos, ending their second reign at 49 days. On the August 12, 2019 post-Summerslam episode of \\"Raw\\", during a scheduled tag team match where The Revival were facing Lucha House Party (Lince Dorado and Gran Metalik, with Kalisto), the 24/7 champion R-Truth ran out from backstage, being chased by several wrestlers. The match was called off and The Revival performed a \\"Hart Attack\\" on Truth and simultaneously pinned him to become the first co-champions of the 24/7 Championship. However, in the same night, R-Truth pinned Dawson, with the help of Carmella, to regained the title.  SmackDown Tag Team Champions and departure (2019‚Äì2020)  Following SummerSlam, The Revival began to appear on SmackDown Live, aligning themselves with Randy Orton in a feud against The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods). On September 15 at Clash of Champions, The Revival defeated The New Day's Big E and Woods to capture the SmackDown Tag Team Championship, making them the first team to hold the Raw, SmackDown, and NXT Tag Team Championships, and thus the first-ever WWE Tag Team Triple Crown Champions. As part of the draft, The Revival was drafted to the SmackDown brand. As Randy Orton had become drafted to the Raw brand, this signified the end of The Revival's alliance with Orton. On the November 8 episode of SmackDown, The Revival lost the SmackDown Tag Team titles back to The New Day's Big E and Kingston, ending their reign at 54 days. They received a rematch for the titles at TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs, but was again defeated by The New Day. Later that same night, The Revival also aligned themselves with King Corbin, assisting him in defeating Roman Reigns, but that alliance ended quietly. On the January 31, 2020 episode of SmackDown, The Revival lost to John Morrison and The Miz in a fatal four-way tag team match also involving Heavy Machinery (Otis and Tucker) and Lucha House Party, in a match where the winner would earn a Smackdown Tag Team Championship match at Super ShowDown; this would The Revival's final televised match in WWE. On the February 7, 2020 episode of SmackDown, they attacked Intercontinental Champion Braun Strowman alongside Sami Zayn and Shinsuke Nakamura, in their final appearances in WWE. On April 10, The Revival were granted their releases from WWE, fifteen months after their request in January 2019. In an interview the following month, the duo explained that they had asked for their releases because \\"the tag team division doesn't get respect, it doesn't get the time that we think a lot of these teams deserve and we want to take chances on ourselves\\", and that they felt that otherwise they would have \\"no legacy aside from our NXT stuff\\". They also stated: \\"The tag team titles, they don't really mean anything\\", pointing out that Braun Strowman had \\"steam-rolled the entire tag team division\\" by himself before winning the Raw Tag Team Championship with 10-year old non- wrestler Nicholas at WrestleMania 34. According to the duo, WWE management originally thought that The Revival was bluffing in order to receive a push, and that the push they received shortly after (they won the Raw Tag Team Championship the following month, with three more title wins later the same year) was a result of it, even after they repeatedly insisted that they did not want to win titles because they believed WWE's tag team championships were meaningless. During the two's last months in the company, Vince McMahon personally designed an entirely new gimmick for The Revival. However, the duo found the proposed characters \\"less than flattering\\", with Wilder stating that he laughed out loud when McMahon gave them pictures displaying their offered new looks. The designs, which have since leaked online, had the two wearing lipstick, bright colors and tassels and carrying glow sticks, with Wilder also wearing suspenders and a large \\"Shatter Machine\\" sign on a chain necklace. The duo stated that they had immediately told McMahon that these new characters were \\"bad\\", and that while they would portray them if WWE wanted, they would still leave the company once their contracts expired in June 2020. In the same May 2020 interview, Wheeler and Harwood stated their belief that this was the moment McMahon and WWE executives realized that the two actually intended to leave the company; this resulted in The Revival being permanently taken off- television until their release. Following their departure from WWE, the team released a video on their social media pages using the new catchphrase \\"Fear The Revolt\\" (FTR); this resulted in their new ring name being largely reported to be The Revolt. Furthermore, Wilder changed his ring name to Cash Wheeler while Dawson changed his to Dax Harwood (with both now using their real-life last names, while Wheeler was now using the first name he originally wanted in WWE). On May 10, 2020, the duo received a cease and desist letter over the usage of the name \\"The Revolt\\" by the attorney of Caleb Konley and Zane Riley, a duo who had been using the name on the independent circuit since 2015; the letter stated that \\"[Wheeler and Harwood's] conduct is not only unlawful, it is truly shameless that they would willfully steal a name from those that worked so hard to build it up\\". A letter sent by Wheeler and Harwood's attorney, Michael E. Dockins, the following day, announced that Wheeler and Harwood's team name was not The Revolt but \\"FTR\\", which \\"would mean different things depending on their storyline and creatives\\", and that they could keep using the \\"Fear The Revolt\\" catchphrase regardless. While Konley and Riley claim that Wheeler and Harwood, who knew them personally, knew about their previous use of the Revolt name, Dockins stated that his clients \\"were not aware of and, at worst, have no recollection of ever knowing of [Konley and Riley]'s claimed rights in a REVOLT-inclusive trademark.\\"pwinsider: \\"THE FORMER REVIVAL RECEIVES CEASE & DESIST OVER 'THE REVOLT' NAME, STATE THAT THEY NEVER INTENDED TO USE THE TERM AS THEIR TEAM NAME, COMPLETE DETAILS ON WHERE EVERYTHING STANDS\\" =All Elite Wrestling (2020‚Äìpresent)= On the May 27, 2020 episode of Dynamite, Harwood and Wheeler made their All Elite Wrestling debut as FTR, saving The Young Bucks from an attack by The Butcher and The Blade thus establishing themselves as babyfaces in the process. They made their in-ring debut on the June 10 episode of Dynamite, where they defeated The Butcher and The Blade. During the following weeks, FTR had interactions with The Young Bucks and the AEW World Tag Team Champions Kenny Omega and Hangman Page, including a match at Fyter Fest where FTR and The Young Bucks were defeated by The Lucha Bros and The Butcher and The Blade in an eight-man tag team match. On the August 12 episode of Dynamite, FTR hosted Tag Team Appreciation Night where they invited Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard and The Rock 'n' Roll Express to the show. However, after a scuffle between Tully Blanchard and Ricky Morton, FTR would attack Rock 'n' Roll Express thus turning heel in the process. The following week, FTR would recruit Blanchard as their manager as they defeated Private Party. On the August 27 episode of Dynamite, FTR defeated The Natural Nightmares, Best Friends and The Young Bucks in a Gauntlet match to earn an AEW World Tag Team Championship match at All Out. At the event, they defeated Omega and Page to capture the titles, making them the first team to have held tag team titles in both AEW and WWE. Professional wrestling style and persona The Revival have been praised by their old-school style and knowledge of tag team wrestling.https://superluchas.com/en/why-the-revival-is-the-best-couple-today- in-wwe/https://pwinsider.com/article/135485/will-the-revival-land-in-aew-jim- ross-weighs-in.html?p=1https://www.pwinsider.com/article/106093/complete-wwe- nxt-takeover-toronto-report-joe-versus-nakamura-diy-versus-revival-in-a-two- out-of-three-falls-match-the-battle-for-canada-the-dusty-classic-finals-and- mickie-james-return-to-a-wwe-ring.html?p=1 Pro wrestling booker and manager Jim Cornette, known for his old-school approach, has praised the team on several occasions.https://411mania.com/wrestling/jim-cornette-wont-manage- revival-aew-interested-long-term-role-anywhere/ The team uses the phrase \\"No flips, just fists\\"https://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/wwe-grants-revivals- immediate-release-308556 to convey their more traditional, mat based in-ring style in contrast to the more high flying style of some contemporary teams. The duo said that they were modeled after The Brain Busters and the Condrey/Eaton version of The Midnight Express.https://prowrestling.net/site/2020/05/06/the-revolt-f-k-a-the-revival- on-talk-is-jericho-recap-cash-wheeler-and-dax-harwood-discuss-their-future- why-they-turned-down-a-big-money-wwe-offer-dusty-rhodes-as-an-influence-teams- they-want-t/ Dusty Rhodes gave Wheeler his WWE ring name, Dash Wilder; Wheeler wanted to call his character \\"Cash\\" instead of \\"Dash\\", but Rhodes preferred the latter because it reminded him of his son Cody's nickname, \\"Dashing\\", while Wilder was chosen due to its similarity to Wheeler. After the two left WWE, Dawson and Wilder changed their names to Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler, now using their real last names while paying tribute to Demolition's Ax and Smash.https://twitter.com/CashWheelerFTR/status/1256808038188670978 The duo's finishing move, called \\"Shatter Machine\\" in WWE, was inspired by the \\"Codebreaker\\" used by Chris Jericho, whom the two saw as a major inspiration; although WWE staff had told them they didn't need it, the two asked for Jericho's approval to use the move, which he gave them. The duo confirmed after leaving WWE that they would change the move's name. As FTR, the duo renamed the move to the \\"Goodnight Express\\", an homage to The Midnight Express. FTR also uses an assisted spike piledriver called the \\"Mind Breaker\\" as their double-team finishing move in AEW, modeled after the Brain Busters's own finisher. Other media The Revival made their video game debut as playable characters in WWE 2K17 and have since appeared in WWE 2K18, WWE 2K19, and WWE 2K20.

Early life James Dorward was born in Fife, Scotland, in 1841.Index to the Captains Registers of Lloyd‚Äôs of London. (Guildhall Library Ms. 18567) Career Dorward received his certificate of competency as a master (No. 30,510) in Dundee in 1867. He is listed in the Index to the Captains Registers of Lloyd's of London (Guildhall Library Ms. 18567) from that year until 1908. In 1888, he was the master of the barque Estrella de Chile of the Glen Line, having been in that position for about four and a half years, when she was wrecked in the Solway Firth on 25 November 1888 while carrying a cargo of steel rails from Whitehaven, Cumbria, to Rosario, Argentina. The ship first became stranded on a bank to the north of the Workington Bank but floated free and later ran aground on the Robin Rigg Sand from which it could not free itself. As the position worsened, and the ship filled with water, the crew sought refuge in the rigging and the first mate drowned after being knocked from the mizzen mast. The rest of the crew were rescued by the Maryport lifeboat who landed them safely there. The court of enquiry into the wreck, of 18 & 19 December 1888, found that Dorward misjudged his position but did not recommend the suspension of his certificate in deference to his record, diligence in the performance of his duties in difficult waters, and his ship having been cast off in a less than ideal position by the tug that towed the ship from Whitehaven.Wreck Report for 'Estrella de Chile', 1888.

Its central political figure was Bishop Fan Noli. After the June Revolution, Ahmet Zogu and his supporters managed to overthrow Noli's government, making also use of the financials and military support from Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Greece. Most of the former democratic opposition fled to Italy, settling later in the western Europe, mainly in Vienna. Two organizations were formed there; KONARE and \\"Bashkimi Komb√´tar\\" (National Union). The second consisted of patriotic-democratic anti-Zogist figures, while KONARE comprised also strong left-wing ideology. Beside being the main anti-Zogist opposition during 1925‚Äì30, it showed was anti-feudal, anti-imperialist, and pro-Soviet nuances. KONARE managed to retrieve financial support by the COMINTERN with the intermediation of Kosta Boshnjaku, one of the first Communist emissaries deployed by the soviets in Albania with the task of establishing communist cells, and possibly a Communist Party. In addition to young revolutionary activists, KONARE also attracted the members of the irredentist Committee of Kosovo, who were the sworn enemies of Ahmet Zogu and vice versa. Noli and Boshnjaku managed to procure some financial support for the Committee through Comintern, affiliating them with the Balkan Federation. According to Sejfi Vllamasi's memoirs, the founder of KONARE beside Fan Noli were: Qazim Koculi, Mustafa Kruja, Riza Dani, and Xhevat Kor√ßa from the former \\"Krahu Komb√´tar\\" political fraction of the Albanian Parliament, other civilians and officers as Kol Tromara, Qazim Kokoshi, Llano Borshi, Major Shefqet Kor√ßa, captains Aziz √áami and Riza Cerova; and most of the youth members of \\"Bashkimi\\" (The Union) - a former political group founded by Avni Rustemi, such as Halim Xhelo, Sejfulla Mal√´shova, Llazar Fundo, Qamil √áela, Demir Godelli, Selim Shpuza, Haki St√´rmilli, Reshat K√´lli√ßi, etc. The main press organ of KONARE was Liria Komb√´tare (National Freedom). Early revolutionary figures like Halim Xhelo and Riza Cerova would crystallize their political persona through this newspaper. In April 1927, KONARE changed the name to Komiteti i √álirimit Komb√´tar (National Liberation Committee). By 1928, it came de facto under the control of Comintern; 24 young Albanians were sent to Moscow to follow their studies in high-end Soviet institutions. Despite the efforts, the committee did not pose any real threats to Zogu's regime, who from his side was elected President of Albania in 1925 (thus ending the era of the Principality of Albania), while on 1 September 1928 became Zog I, King of Albania, establishing a constitutional monarchy. Disappointed by the political overturns, Noli decided to retire from political life and move back to the US. This would start the end of the committee, which would practically cease by mid 1930s. Many of its political figures moved into the parallel \\"National Union\\" organization which would continue to oppose the Zogu's regime in Albania, culminating with the assassination attempt of 1931.

It is orders of magnitude more stable than existing navigation clocks, and has been refined to limit drift of no more than 1 nanosecond in 10 days. It is expected that a DSAC would incur no more than 1 microsecond of error in 10 years of operations. It is expected to improve the precision of deep space navigation, and enable more efficient use of tracking networks. The project is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and it was deployed as part of the U.S. Air Force's Space Test Program 2 (STP-2) mission aboard a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on 25 June 2019. The Deep Space Atomic Clock was activated on 23 August 2019. As of June 2020, NASA has extended the DSAC mission through August 2021.  Overview  Current ground-based atomic clocks are fundamental to deep space navigation, however, they are too large to be flown in space. This results in tracking data being collected and processed here on Earth (a two- way link) for most deep space navigation applications. The Deep Space Atomic Clock (DSAC) is a miniaturized and stable mercury ion atomic clock that is as stable as a ground clock. The technology could enable autonomous radio navigation for spacecraft's time-critical events such as orbit insertion or landing, promising new savings on mission operations costs. It is expected to improve the precision of deep space navigation, enable more efficient use of tracking networks, and yield a significant reduction in ground support operations. Its applications in deep space include: * Simultaneously track two spacecraft on a downlink with the Deep Space Network (DSN). * Improve tracking data precision by an order of magnitude using the DSN's Ka-band downlink tracking capability. * Mitigate Ka-band's weather sensitivity (as compared to two-way X-band) by being able to switch from a weather-impacted receiving antenna to one in a different location with no tracking outages. * Track longer by using a ground antenna's entire spacecraft viewing period. At Jupiter, this yields a 10‚Äì15% increase in tracking; at Saturn, it grows to 15‚Äì25%, with the percentage increasing the farther a spacecraft travels. * Make new discoveries as a Ka-band ‚Äî capable radio science instrument with a 10 times improvement in data precision for both gravity and occultation science and deliver more data because of one-way tracking's operational flexibility. * Explore deep space as a key element of a real-time autonomous navigation system that tracks one-way radio signals on the uplink and, coupled with optical navigation, provides for robust absolute and relative navigation. * Fundamental to human explorers requiring real-time navigation data. = Principle and development = Over 20 years, engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory have been steadily improving and miniaturizing the mercury-ion trap atomic clock. The DSAC technology uses the property of mercury ions' hyperfine transition frequency at 40.50 GHz to effectively \\"steer\\" the frequency output of a quartz oscillator to a near-constant value. DSAC does this by confining the mercury ions with electric fields in a trap and protecting them by applying magnetic fields and shielding. Its development includes a test flight in low-Earth orbit, while using GPS signals to demonstrate precision orbit determination and confirm its performance in radio navigation.  Deployment  The flight unit is being hosted ‚Äî along with other four payloads ‚Äî on the Orbital Test Bed (OTB) satellite, provided by General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems, using the Swift satellite bus.General Atomics Completes Ready-For-Launch Testing of Orbital Test Bed Satellite.

History The site of the current building was once referred to as \\"The Weed Block\\", (located at Main & Swan) and was built in 1857. The block was home to Millard Fillmore's law office and other prominent Buffalo businessmen. In May 1893, John J. Albright, along with George V. Forman, John Satterfield, and Franklin D. Locke, founded The Fidelity Trust and Guaranty Company of Buffalo, New York. The block was demolished in 1901 to make room for the Fidelity Trust Building. In 1909, the officers of the Fidelity Trust company commissioned Green & Wicks to build the Fidelity Trust Building. Anson Goodyear described George V. Forman in the following way: \\"every morning left his house at a certain hour and met George Williams at his house just above North Street, to walk to the Fidelity Building together. Mr. Forman boasted a very prominent corporation and leaned backward to achieve his balance. Mr. Williams was emaciated and bent forward to achieve his. It was a procession on which people checked their watches.\\" In December 1925, the Fidelity Trust Company, with $35 million in assets, merged with Manufacturers and Traders Bank, founded in 1856, with $64 million in assets, under the new name Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company. The $100 million company was headed by Fidelity's President, 36-year-old Lewis G. Harriman. Harriman and a group of investors including A. H. Schoellkopf and James Forrestal, who would become the first United States Secretary of Defense, owned enough shares to control both Fidelity and M&T.; In 1926, the building was expanded with the addition of the west wing. E. B. Green completed the addition. The Fidelity Trust Building is adjacent to the White Building, a double sided building facing both Main and Erie streets, at 298 Main Street. =Subsequent use= The building was later called the M&T; Building, and later still the NFTA Building.

The residence of the United States Ambassador to the United Nations is the official residence of the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. It was previously located in a suite of rooms on the 42nd floor of the Waldorf- Astoria Hotel in New York City leased by the U.S. Department of State, until shortly after the Chinese Anbang Insurance Company purchase of the Waldorf- Astoria in 2015 raised security concerns. Described in press reports as \\"palatial\\", the establishment of the former residence in 1947 marked the first time in history that an ambassadorial residence had been located in a hotel. Currently, the ambassador's residence is located at 50 United Nations Plaza, where the United States purchased a penthouse apartment in May 2019, after initially renting a different penthouse apartment in the same building. Former Waldorf-Astoria residence =Background= Beginning in 1947, shortly after the siting of the United Nations secretariat in New York, the U.S. State Department took a long-term lease for occupancy of a suite of rooms by the U.S. ambassador at the Waldorf-Astoria, a luxury hotel constructed in 1931. The establishment of the ambassador's residence at the Waldorf-Astoria made it the first hotel in history to house an ambassadorial residence. In 1960, a townhouse at Sutton Place, originally constructed by J.P. Morgan in 1921, was donated to the U.S. government by then owner Arthur Houghton with the intention it be used as a new ambassadorial residence. However, ambassador Adlai Stevenson II determined the home was not to his liking and the residence continued at the Waldorf-Astoria. (The Sutton Place townhouse was subsequently re-gifted by the United States to the United Nations and currently serves as the official residence of the Secretary-General of the United Nations.) In 1978, Ebony reported that Andrew Young and his family explored the possibility of moving out of the suite at the Waldorf-Astoria and into a house instead. Young, who was the first ambassador to live in the suite with \\"young children\\", stated that \\"[t]he Waldorf is very nice, and its convenient, but I just have problems trying to bring up a small child in a hotel.\\" However, the search ultimately \\"became a media issue\\" and Young elected to stay in the suite. Nevertheless, he opined that \\"[p]eople tried to make it seem like I was saying that the Waldorf wasn't good enough for us\\". As of 1999, the State Department was paying $360,000 per year to lease the suite on a rolling basis; the lease is renewed every ten years with an optional one or two year short- term extension. In 2015, it was announced the State Department would no longer permit staff to be housed at the Waldorf-Astoria, due to security concerns arising from the recent purchase of the property by Chinese business interests. Whether the decision would impact the status of the residence was not made clear, however, as of March 2016 the hotel was still being occupied by the U.S. ambassador. The New York Times reported that in 2016 the Obama Administration decided to find a new home for the US Ambassador to the UN - a rented penthouse in the 50 United Nations Plaza - rather than the Waldorf to alleviate security concerns associated with the purchase of the Waldorf by a Chinese insurance company with a murky ownership structure; the rented penthouse is the home of Ambassador Kelly Craft. =Notable residents= John F. Kennedy, U Thant, and Adlai Stevenson at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1962. Madeleine Albright, George H. W. Bush, Charles W. Yost, Adlai Stevenson II, Samantha Power, and Bill Richardson are among notable former residents of the suite. During his 1999‚Äì2001 tenure as U.N. ambassador, Richard Holbrooke elected not to occupy the 42nd floor apartment, choosing instead to live in his private Manhattan home. In his place, the residence was temporarily occupied by Holbrooke's assistant, then 27-year old Randolph Eddy. According to reports, Holbrooke and his wife, journalist Kati Marton, would throw \\"glittery parties\\" in the suite \\"where pols and foreign ministers mixed with the likes of Robert De Niro and Sarah Jessica Parker.\\" = Design = The suite is located on \\"the very top floor\\" of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Described in press accounts as \\"palatial,\\" the residence is decorated with, among other items, a Jim Dine painting, an Alexander Calder mobile, and a grand piano, and features \\"twinkling city views\\" of the New York skyline. The front door to the suite is framed by a golden eagle. It is located on the opposite side of the corridor from the \\"royal suite\\", so-called as it was long used by the Duke of Windsor as his unofficial New York City residence. As of 1971, the interior of the suite was sectioned into nine rooms, including five bedrooms and a living room with a tall ceiling, which was used to \\"host large official receptions.\\" Dorothy Bush Koch noted that the apartment was designed with \\"high ceilings, handsome old woodwork, working fireplaces, and big windows with beautiful views of New York City.\\" 50 United Nations Plaza After the acquisition of the Waldorf-Astoria by a Chinese insurance company, security concerns caused the State Department to seek a new residence for the ambassador. The government leased a full-floor penthouse apartment at 50 United Nations Plaza, where Nikki Haley was the first ambassador to take up residence. The United States later purchased a different full-floor penthouse in May 2019. The five bedroom, 6.5 bathroom unit was purchased for $15.85 million.

It became a Grade II listed building in 1972. Description and history The statue is a copy of a 1712 sculpture by Francis Bird in Carrara marble which formerly stood at the same location. Queen Anne was the ruling British monarch when the new St Paul's Cathedral was completed in 1710. Bird's statue was unveiled at a thanksgiving service for the Peace of Utrecht, held 7 July 1713. The statue cost ¬£1,130, excluding the marble which was provided by the Queen. It was surrounded by an elegant metal railing made by Jean Tijou. The Tijou railings were later removed and replaced by heavier railings to match the others around the cathedral. The original statue was attacked at least three times, in 1743, 1768, and 1882, with noses and arms damaged, and it was also badly weathered by the 1880s. Reputedly, the statue was once defaced with the lines \\"Brandy Nan, Brandy Nan, left in the lurch; Her face to the gin-shop, her back to the church\\", alluding to the Queen's reputed fondness for strong liquor and the location of a gin palace near the cathedral. Richard Claude Belt was commissioned in 1885 to create a replacement statue from Sicilian marble, supplied by the Corporation of London at a cost of ¬£1,800. Belt was imprisoned for obtaining money by false pretences in March 1886, and Louis-Auguste Malempr√© completed the sculpture. The building work to install the statue was done by Mowlem and Sons, supervised by the city architect Sir Horace Jones, and the new sculpture was unveiled by Reginald Hanson, the Lord Mayor of London, on 15 December 1886, the year before the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The Baroque sculpture depicts Queen Anne standing, facing down Ludgate Hill towards Ludgate Circus. She is robed, wearing the collar of the Order of the Garter and a gilded crown, with one hand holding a gilded orb and the other a gilded sceptre. The figure stands on a Portland stone pedestal by architect Christopher Wren, decorated with four symbolic figures, one on each corner: to the west, towards Ludgate Hill, are Britannia with gilded trident (representing England) and a figure representing France (with fleur-de-lys on the visor of her helmet), holding between them a carved representation of the British Royal Coat of Arms, and to the east, towards St Paul's Cathedral, are figures representing Ireland (with harp) and North America (a Native American, with feathered skirt and headdress, gilded bow, quiver of arrows, and lizard). The pedestal stands on three steps surrounded by heavy cast iron railings. The pedestal bears two inscriptions: on the south side \\"The Original STATUE / was erected on this spot in the year 1712 / to commemorate the completion of / SAINT PAUL'S CATHEDRAL / FRANCIS BIRD Sculptor.\\" and on the north side: \\"This Replica / of the Statue of QUEEN ANNE / was erected at the expense of / The CORPORATION of LONDON / In the year 1886 / The Rt. Hon. / SIR REGINALD HANSON M.A. F.S.A. / Lord Mayor / Wm. Braham Esq / Chairman of the City Lands Committee.\\" After they were removed, the original 8-ton weathered sculpture, and the four similarly weathered 5-ton stone figures from the base, were rediscovered months later abandoned in the yard of a London stonemason. They were acquired by Augustus Hare and installed in the grounds of his house at Holmhurst St Mary near Hastings, with Queen Anne mounted on an elliptical pedestal and the four other seated figures on steps around at the base, similar to the original. The house was Grade II listed in 1976, and the statue received a separate Grade II* listing at the same time.

It was designed by Richard Gailey and built from 1890 to 1891 by T. Kelly. It is also known as Widgee Shire Council Chambers, Coolooa Shire Council Chambers and Gympie Regional Council Chambers. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 April 2011.  History  The former Bank of New South Wales building located in upper Mary Street, Gympie was designed by Richard Gailey and built in 1890-91. This two storey neo-classical building was purpose-built as the Gympie branch of the Bank of New South Wales, which had been operating at the Gympie goldfield since March 1868. It comprised ground floor banking facilities, upper floor manager's residence and a basement. Gympie (initially known as Nashville) was established after the discovery of gold in the Mary River district in October 1867. The new goldfield turned Queensland into a significant gold producer, contributing much needed finances to the young colony. Thousands of people arrived at the Gympie goldfield in the months after the discovery and a fledgling settlement emerged. In a year the alluvial gold had been exhausted and shallow reef mining commenced. As Gympie evolved from a hastily established mining settlement, the early makeshift structures of the 1860s gradually gave way to more permanent and substantial public and private buildings from the mid 1870s. With the change to deep reef mining from 1875, came the need for extensive capital investment through the formation of companies using foreign as well as local capital. During 1881, mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie as an intensive phase of underground reef mining began, facilitated by the injection of capital into mining companies for machinery and employees. The influx of money and the resultant yield of gold was reflected in the redevelopment of upper Mary Street during the 1880s and 1890s with substantial commercial buildings such as banks, company secretaries' and brokers' offices. One of these was the Bank of New South Bank building, which opened in 1891. The Bank of New South Wales (BNSW) was the first bank established in Australia (February 1817) but it was restricted to trading in Sydney until 1850. After restructure in that year it opened its first branch outside Sydney, in Brisbane, on 14 November 1850. It expanded rapidly thereafter with the rush of gold discoveries in New South Wales and Victoria. The bank set up agencies and gold-buying agents at every new diggings in order to spread its network and consolidate its position. Bank officers were urged on by their superiors to be the first to a new location to set up a gold-buying agency. By 1861 the BNSW had grown from a single Sydney office in 1850 to a network of 37 branches in Australia and New Zealand. Lower Mary Street (the bank is 3rd from left), 1868 Subsequently, with the discovery of gold at Gympie the Bank opened an agency on the goldfield on 21 March 1868, less than six months after the goldfield's establishment. In the same year the bank transferred to a building owned by Merry and Davis. An 1868 photograph of lower Mary Street, Gympie shows the Bank of New South Wales operating from a weatherboard-clad building with a shingle roof. The bank, 1872 Over the ensuing years as it became increasingly clear that the Gympie goldfield was a long-term proposition, a series of steps towards permanency were taken by the bank reflecting this longevity. Firstly, in 1872 the BNSW agency converted to a branch with the increased banking services that entailed. Secondly, in 1879 the bank purchased the allotment on which the current building stands and occupied the timber and tin building on the site until selling it prior to the building of the current structure. Thirdly, the decision at the end of the 1880s to build a masonry building followed the growth of deep reef mining on the goldfield and the rise in Gympie's gold output throughout the decade. The 1880s were a decade of rapid growth and development and rising land prices in Queensland. Mainly due to Queensland's three major gold mining centres - Gympie, Charters Towers and Mount Morgan - the value of gold output rose from in 1883 to in 1889, exceeding the value of exported wool. Gold production contributed between 21.61 and 35.53 percent of Queensland's export income during the 1880s and 1890s. These enormous amounts of gold were purchased by banks such as the BNSW, which played a vital role in this process of wealth creation and distribution. In 1881, the bank was burned down along with a number of other buildings in a large fire. In February 1890 Brisbane architect Richard Gailey advertised for tenders to build a brick building for the Bank of New South Wales in Gympie. On 24 March the old bank building on the site was sold and building of the new premises commenced. Business commenced in the new premises on 31 March 1891, completed at a cost of . The two storey building comprised rendered brick walls and an iron roof. At the rear was a two-stall stable with harness room. The second storey of the building comprised the manager's residence and an early photograph shows a verandah on the lower (eastern) side of the first floor. The building's architect, Richard Gailey (1834-1924) was a Londonderry man who had settled in Brisbane in 1864. He established his own practice there in 1865, and over the next 60 years built up a thriving business; working until his death in 1924. He designed Baptist churches including the Baptist City Tabernacle in Brisbane, the former Baptist Church in Ipswich; commercial buildings such as banks including the Westpac Bank Building in Normanton; and many hotels including the Jubilee Hotel, Orient Hotel, Regatta Hotel and Wickham Hotel (all in Brisbane). Many commercial buildings in Brisbane designed by Gailey during the 1880s were characterised by classical idioms and details. Substantial changes in the Queensland mining sector occurred after 1900. A treatment process for mine tailings that used cyanide had provided Gympie a record yield in 1899. Gold production in Queensland peaked in 1903, due largely to a final burst of production at Gympie, which was followed by a 60% decrease in production between 1903 and 1913 as the three major Queensland goldfields (Charters Towers, Gympie and Mount Morgan) declined simultaneously. The Gympie field passed through its most profitable period from 1901 to 1906 and in 1903 recorded an output of 146,000 fine ounces (surpassing Mount Morgan that year). After 1906 the decline that had set in at Gympie in 1904 accelerated, finally resulting in the closure of the last mine . In conjunction with this downturn Gympie evolved into a service town for the region's growing dairy and agricultural industries. Over time the commercial centre of the town moved eastward down Mary Street in response to the commercial activity centring upon the railway station. The BNSW continued to operate from its location in upper Mary Street until June 1940 when the Bank purchased a block of land closer to the commercial centre of the town at the corner of Mary and Smithfield Streets and new premises were erected. The BNSW building at 242 Mary Street was sold to the Widgee Shire Council in the same year. Alterations to the former BNSW building were made on several occasions. In 1902 \\"steel\\" [metal] ceilings were fitted in the BNSW building by Messrs Crane and son. In 1938 the BNSW made alterations and additions to the bank premises and installed a septic system. After purchase by the Widgee Shire Council in 1940 the building was used as shire chambers and office space after some changes were made for this purpose by architects Addison and McDonald who called tenders in June 1940. In February 1981, extension and alterations to the south-east of the building to provide offices facing Mary Street took place. In 1993, the Shire of Widgee was amalgamated with the City of Gympie to create the Shire of Cooloola. The building continued to be used as the Cooloola Shire Council Chambers. In 2008, the Shires of Cooloola and Kilkivan and part of the Shire of Tiaro were amalgamated into the Gympie Region. The building continues to be used as the Gympie Regional Council Chambers.  Description  A compact but grand, three storey, rendered brick building in a classical idiom, the former Bank of New South Wales stands prominently to upper Mary Street, Gympie. Built on a sloping site with frontages to Mary and Reef streets, the three bay main elevation to Mary Street is defined by the corner banded pilasters and articulated by two implied orders of pilasters, Corinthian to the upper level and Doric within a rusticated treatment to the ground level. Projecting cornices and continuous window sills to each level together with a balustraded parapet and a blind balustrade below the upper level windows give horizontal unity. Projecting banded pilasters frame the central bay which accommodates a rusticated portal entrance below a serlian inspired window. The upper level outer bays accommodate pedimented full pane sash windows framed by plain projecting architraves with base ears. The street level accommodates two full pane sash windows to the south bay and a sash window and six panel timber door with large fanlight to the north. The Reef Street elevation consists of the west wing, each level of which is punctuated by a central full pane sash window, and the enclosed extension beyond the upper level verandah. The northwest and southeast elevations are partly obscured by adjacent buildings. The northwest elevation of the west wing is notable for the decorative metal awning to the upper sash window. The southeast elevation is divided into four bays by plain pilasters, is crowned by a blind parapet concealing the hipped roof beyond and is punctuated by full pane sash windows to each level. The entablature and cornice of the upper level of the front elevation continues around in the southeast elevation. A lower curved parapet screens the rear upper level verandah roof and the elevation houses a narrow rectangular louvred window. There is evidence of the removal of French windows and replacement with the sash windows to the upper level of the southeast elevation. The earlier verandah has been replaced by a suspended awning. The building is sheltered by hipped roofs clad with corrugated metal sheeting and three rendered masonry chimneys project through the roof. Square in plan with a projecting west wing, the building is organised over three levels. The former banking chamber is accommodated at the Mary Street level, the bank vaults and storage are housed in the basement and the former bank manager's residence occupies the upper level. The ground floor retains the major spaces of the former bank including the main banking chamber, manager's office and strong room and accountant/clerks office and the entrance to the residence above. The banking chamber is accessed from the central main entrance off Mary Street and is notable for its decorative pressed metal ceiling. The manager's office, opening off the chamber to the northwest, has a pressed metal ceiling, granite surround fireplace and a substantial strong room to the southwest. The strong room, a painted brick rectangular space with a barrel vaulted ceiling, has a heavy metal door with the maker's plate \\"Milners' 212 Patent Thief- Resisting\\". The strong room houses a small safe with the maker's plate \\"John Tann's Reliance Safe\\". The accountant/clerks office, a large rectangular room to the southwest of the banking chamber is notable for its decorative plaster ceiling in an art deco style. The interior walls of the former banking floor spaces, except the strong room, are plaster finished and are distinguished by timber veneer wall panelling. The office in the west wing retains its fireplace cavity now housing a cupboard. The basement, level with Reef Street, has a concrete floor and concrete and brick walls and accommodates a number of vaults and storage rooms below the banking floor. In some spaces the timber frame of the floor above is unlined. The rear office has a painted off form concrete finish to the walls and fireplace and the ceiling is lined with fibre cement sheeting. A handsome cedar staircase with finely turned balustrades and carved newel posts rises from the corridor extending from the northern entrance off Mary Street. The upper level is organised around a central corridor incorporating a hall at the top of the stairs with two rooms to the Mary Street side and two to Reef Street. French windows to the rooms on the Reef Street side open onto a verandah, now enclosed with weatherboard cladding and casement windows, running along the Reef Street side. All interior walls are plastered and this level is notable for decorative pressed metal ceilings to rooms, hall, corridor and staircase soffits and the retention of much original cedar joinery including skirtings, architraves, doors and windows. The front rooms have back to back fireplaces with marble surrounds. Decorative arches with prominent keystones at the top of the stairs and part way along the corridor define the hall. Accessed from the rear verandah, the single room west wing is lit by full pane sash windows on three sides and has a recent plain plaster ceiling. A concrete parking area runs to the rear of the building accessed from Reef Street. Recent partitioning and extensions to the southwest of the building at all levels and a new wing to the southeast are not considered to be of heritage significance.  Heritage listing  The former Bank of New South Wales building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 April 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Bank of New South Wales building and the important gold- era precinct of which it is a part are physical evidence of the evolution of Gympie gold mining, a major contributor to the wealth of Queensland for approximately 60 years from 1867. As Gympie gold production continued and evolved from alluvial to shallow reef mining to deep reef mining from 1875, this change was reflected in the erection of more permanent and elaborate buildings in the town centre. The bank building, erected during the third stage of Gympie mining, symbolised the wealth and permanence of the town. For almost fifty years the building served as a Bank of New South Wales branch and manager's residence. Its siting near Commissioner's Hill in the vicinity of important government and gold-related buildings, and its later sale when the centre of the town moved eastwards after gold production ceased also illustrate the evolution of Gympie's development. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former bank building, designed by Richard Gailey, is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a regional bank of its era. This two-storey masonry structure in the classical style retains its banking chamber, offices, strong room, vaults and manager's residence. Its siting with other important gold-related buildings, high above the gold diggings, illustrates the significance of banks in the gold mining town of Gympie. Its intactness is demonstrated in its planning, room volumes, joinery, strong room and pressed metal ceilings. The former manager's residence, including its ground floor entry, retains its floor plan, decorative plaster cornices, windows, doors and joinery. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The former bank building has aesthetic significance for its architectural qualities expressed in the craftsmanship and detailing of the joinery and finishes, and for its streetscape value through its form, scale and design. These qualities complement other surviving 19th century buildings in the street, particularly other banks also entered in the Queensland Heritage Register including the nearby former Australian Joint Stock Bank (later the Gympie Stock Exchange). Its balanced classical design, often associated with banks, projects the concept of stability that financial institutions of this era sought to convey through their buildings' architecture.

It is one half of a commission installed in 1992 when the adjacent Criterion Theatre was refurbished. The other half, the Daughters of Helios or Three Graces, is a sculpture of three women leaping off the building six stories above. The Horses of Helios comprises three bronze elements with dark patina: one pair of horses weighing approximately 4 tons, and two single horses. The four rearing horses appear to be bursting from the water of a fountain. It depicts Aethon, Eous, Phlegon, and Pyrois - the four horses of Helios, Greek god of the sun. The sculpture was installed in 1992 in a fountain under a canopy at the base of the building at 1 Jermyn Street, on the corner where Piccadilly meets Haymarket, near Piccadilly Circus in London. The building is adjacent to the Criterion Theatre, and was installed when the theatre was refurbished. The Daughters of Helios or Three Graces depicts the three Charites - Aglaea, Euphrosyne, and Thalia - who in some accounts are the daughters of Helios and the naiad Aegle. The three female figures are made from gold-leaf-covered aluminium. They are installed at roof level, as if leaping off the 6th floor of the building immediately above the horses below.

Venues While Leicester has often been neglected as a centre for popular music , with the new O2 Academy that has recently been built (opened 2010) in the city, more established acts have been booked to play. Current venues for music include: * De Montfort Hall, which has a standing capacity of 1602 and seating capacity of 2000 * The Musician, Crafton Street West, Leicester, (220 capacity) (opened 2000) * The Donkey, 203 Welford Rd, Leicester (opened 2005) * Firebug, Pocklington's Walk, Leicester * The Shed, Yeoman Street, Leicester. * The SoundHouse, 28 Southampton St, Leicester LE1 1SJ In March 2018, the Haymarket Theatre reopened pledging it will stage music events. One of Leicester's main live music venues, The Charlotte, closed in January 2009. It briefly reopened in October 2009 before being closed permanently on 14 March 2010. 1960s Leicester's main small venue for pop and rock was the Il Rondo on Silver Street. The roll call of bands who played at the Il Rondo runs like a who's Who of early‚Äìmid sixties pop and rock. The Yardbirds and The Animals played there before passing into rock history along with less well remembered groups like the Graham Bond Organisation. It also played host to many visiting American blues musicians including Howlin' Wolf, Freddie King, Lowell Fulson, Otis Spann and John Lee Hooker. The Beatles also came to De Montfort Hall. A local beat band called The Foresights were signed to EMI. They were notable for all members wearing glasses. Colin Hyde (East Midlands Oral History Archive) carried out a range of interviews about growing up in Leicester in the 1950s and 1960s and began to map where all of the venues of the day were.talking history:the newsletter of the East Midlands Oral History Archive. Number 7: May 2003. He identified a number of clubs, pubs, and coffee bars like the Chameleon, run by Pete Joseph, the El Casa, or the El Paso ‚Äì cafes which stayed open after the pubs closed. Among others, people also remembered the Blue Beat club on Conduit Street, run by Alex Barrows who later started the House of Happiness on Campbell Street. Night clubs such as the Burlesque or the Nite Owl became more popular as the 1960s progressed, and they opened up the opportunity to dance all night. A local beat band called The Foresights were signed to EMI. They were notable for all members wearing glasses. Also emerging during this period was the notable band Family, fronted by Leicester man Roger Chapman which had some success nationally but mixed success internationally until they disbanded in 1973. 1970s The seventies saw the emergence of the well known cabaret band Showaddywaddy from the city with lead singer Dave Bartram and their 1950s-themed songs. The De Montfort Hall held the first of its annual One-World festivals, with the aim of celebrating the cultural diversity of the city and breaking down the barriers of hostility and suspicion that had a potential to foment racial conflict. Adult and children's groups performed traditional dances and music from the many communities settled here ‚Äì British, Irish, East European, Asian, African and Caribbean. These festivals continued until the 1980s. 1980s The early 1980s saw Leicester punk band Rabid have two minor indie hits, and there were greater successes later in the decade for Yeah Yeah Noh. Leicester funk band The Apollinaires signed to 2 Tone Records in 1982, and released three singles. The mid-1980s saw the emergence of bands such as Gaye Bykers on Acid, Crazyhead, The Bomb Party, and The Hunters Club, who were all associated with the Grebo scene. The Deep Freeze Mice had formed in 1979 and went on to release ten albums in total. Diesel Park West had their first top 75 hits in the late 1980s. Other notable Leicester bands from this decade included Po!, Blab Happy and Chrome Molly. 1990s The band Prolapse, was formed by a group of Leicester University and Polytechnic students in 1992. The band rose in popularity, and quickly gained a record deal with Cherry Red Records, recorded a number of John Peel sessions for Radio 1, and toured with Sonic Youth, Stereolab and Pulp. 1992 also saw the formation in Leicester of Cornershop, an Anglo-Asian agit pop band, who became most famous for the 1998 Number 1 single \\"Brimful of Asha\\". Perfume and Delicatessen both also rose to critical acclaim. Leicester is home of the influential Rave ‚Äì Drum & Bass Formation Records label and associated 5HQ Record Shop, which was reopened in 2012 as an active recording studio. 2000s Since 2000 the city has once more seen a notable upsurge in the success of the local music scene. Several Leicester musicians and/or acts have received considerable media attention in their fields since 2003‚Äì2004. Kasabian, followed by Pacific Ocean Fire, The Displacements, Kyte, Maybeshewill and Neon Sarcastic have all risen from the city to national attention. The Go! Team were first signed to local label Pickled Egg Records, other Leicester musicians feature in notable national and questionably international bands such as; Fun Lovin' Criminals, Happy Mondays, The Holloways, Envy & Other Sins, and A Hawk and a Hacksaw. Kasabian albums Empire and West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum both achieved number one status in the UK Albums Chart in 2006 and 2009 respectively. Success followed in 2010 when the band won the Best British Group Award at the BRIT Awards 2010. Other Leicester acts enjoying chart success in the Official UK Singles Chart during the 2000s include bassline act H \\"Two\\" O eventually reaching number two, and remaining there for three weeks, with their hit single \\"What's It Gonna Be\\". Dance music project Stunt eventually reached number nine with their collaborative hit single \\"Raindrops (Encore Une Fois)\\" (with Sash!). They have also gone on to collaborate with Europop sensation Basshunter. 2006 saw the closure of The Attik, a venue that for over twenty years had played host to hundreds of bands. The newly refurbished 'The Music Cafe', located on New Parks Street, was the venue for The Bandish Projekt and Stereophonics videos in 2011 and late 2012 respectively. Leicester born writer and producer Nat Powers has also been active in the music industry, working with Run Dmc, the son of Dr. Dre amongst others.  2010s  The development of the award- winning music festival Summer Sundae with connecting Summer Sundae Fringe Festival (predominantly run by the local arts collective 'Pineapster') focused on blues and folk music may well provide the city with more of a focus for its local bands to break out nationally. Described by Steve Lamacq as 'the Grandson of Glastonbury and sponsored by BBC Radio 6 Music, the festival took place in the city's Victoria Park from 2011 until 2013 and featured headlining acts including Mumford & Sons, Public Image Ltd and McFly. In 2013, organisers including local label Robot Needs Home established the 'Handmade' music festival which included acts such as Rolo Tomassi, Dutch Uncles and Tall Ships in its debut year. Leicester grime artists such as Kamakaze and Jafro have gained some popularity within the scene during the mid-2010s. In 2015, Kamakaze released a freestyle on JDZ Media, which by 2019 has reached over 3 million views. In 2019, Kamakaze performed a football freestyle on the BBC, and featured on the FIFA 20 Volta soundtrack alongside Leicester producer Massappeals. Kamakaze's song \\"Kam Dog\\" also featured on the gameplay trailer for FIFA 20 Volta.

It is currently the only system in the world with an elected representative in office. The organization strives to increase citizen engagement, transparency and accountability in government through crowdsourcing decision-making to the voting public of Yellowknife. Formation Initially conceived of in 2012 by Paige Saunders it was intended to introduce a form of e-democracy to Yellowknife, IserveU has since become a fully fledged web-based voting platform and volunteer driven organization, orchestrating public events and canvassing. In a letter from one of the organization's founding members, it is stated that prior to the election, IserveU operated through volunteers and a small staff. Voting platform The IserveU voting platform functions as a way to incorporate elements of direct democracy into a representative system, by obligating city council incumbents to vote in accordance with the outcome of online votes ‚Äì effectively creating a way for the public to directly decide the fate of their city. Councillors seeking greater citizen input into decision making post all current motions before the council, on the IserveU site. These motions could be detailed, debated and voted on by the registered userbase before the final outcome is taken to council. Councillors themselves can vote on issues with the weight of the currently 'uncast' votes. That is, the outcome of a motion that has very little public participation will largely be decided by the votes of the councillors, as the votes in the uncast vote pool are equally divided between them. Whereas, a motion that has garnered a large amount of public participation will have a reduced number of uncast votes for the councillors to use, reducing the councillors' impact. The system is still being modified to meet new concerns, and has been released under an open source license on GitHub, to allow even greater public scrutiny and control.

The Agitator was a radical newspaper published by Jay Fox of the anarchist Home Colony in the American state of Washington from 1910 to 1912. In 1913 the paper was briefly relaunched as The Syndicalist as the official organ of William Z. Foster's Syndicalist League of North America, at which time it was moved first to Lakebay, Washington and thereafter to Chicago. The Agitator and its successor were among the most important written vehicles for anarchosyndicalist ideas in America during the decade of the 1910s. Publication history =Launch= The Agitator was launched as a bi-monthly tabloid newspaper in Home, Washington on November 15, 1910.Melvyn Dubofsky, \\"The Agitator: Home, Washington, 1910-1912; The Syndicalist: Lakebay, Washington, and Chicago, 1913,\\" in Joseph R. Conlin (ed.), The American Radical Press, 1880-1960. In Two Volumes. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1968; vol. 1, pg. 114. The editorial task was handled by Jay Fox. The paper concentrated upon the Free speech fights and strikes conducted by the IWW, and was sharply critical of the measured electoral strategy of the Socialist Party of America (SPA). The political line of Fox's publication evolved steadily, beginning from a committed anarchist perspective. In addition to purely political topics, the paper gave space to more avant-garde social ideas not generally part of the discourse of radical newspapers of the day, including coverage of feminist issues and the culture of nudism. =Development= =Name change= Philadelphia-born radical labor activist William Z. Foster left home as a youth to make his own way as an itinerant worker, employed as a deckhand aboard merchant ships and traveling around the United States in pursuit of employment.Dubofsky, \\"The Agitator,\\" pg. 113. By 1909 he had made his was to the Pacific Northwest, coming into contact with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a radical syndicalist trade union. Foster became a member of the IWW upon his arrival but soon became disaffected with the organization's dual union strategy, organizing workers in opposition to other unions already in the field. A brief stint in Europe in 1910 served only to solidify Foster's views on the matter. He returned home committed to the idea of working as a member of the unions of the American Federation of Labor and \\"boring from within\\" their ranks to radicalize these previously cautious and conservative bodies. Foster sought to launch a newspaper as an expression of his views, initially remaining within the ranks of the IWW and attempting to steer the organization to his point of view.Dubofsky, \\"The Agitator,\\" pg. 115. In 1913 Foster joined forces with Fox, changing the name of The Agitator to The Syndicalist and moving the editorial office of the publication away from the Home colony to the town of Lakebay, Washington. =Termination= References Further reading * Mary M.

History The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon is an American late-night talk show hosted by Saturday Night Live alum, Jimmy Fallon, on NBC. The show premiered on February 17, 2014, and it is the seventh incarnation of NBC's long-running Tonight Show franchise, with Fallon serving as the sixth host. The show also stars sidekick and announcer Steve Higgins and house band The Roots. The Tonight Show originates from Studio 6B, where Johnny Carson's Tonight Show also was taped, in Rockefeller Center, New York City. On the October 27, 2015 episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Fallon officially announced Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon, the first one based on a late night talk show, for a 2017 opening at Universal Studios Florida. The attraction would be based on the popular celebrity race segment from Fallon's show.

Initially, Woodbury declined to the idea, until Fallon's move to the Tonight Show proved to be an immediate success. After Woodbury reached out to develop the idea, Jimmy Fallon worked with two of his main writers on the ride's concept for three and a half years. Filming commenced on November 4, 2015 at Studio 8H, where Saturday Night Live originates, as confirmed from photos shared by Fallon on his Instagram account. Fallon is seen wearing a motion capture suit and helmet, while sitting on a makeshift go-kart, surrounded by motion capture cameras, crediting Industrial Light & Magic for the motion capture filming for the attraction. Fallon posted another photo on his Twitter account on a closed set in Vancouver filming new scenes for the attraction on April 18, 2016, this time wearing a suit as he usually wears on The Tonight Show, sitting in a hydraulic go-kart simulator in front of a green screen. Construction began in March 2016, when the first supports for the ride's facade were brought to Stage 50, where the ride is housed. The building's facade is based on 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York, where Studio 6B is located. In a video released by Universal Orlando, early November 2016,The Making of Race Through New York Starring Jimmy Fallon - YouTube and a post by the theme park's official blog various cast and Fallon characters were revealed to have an appearance in the attraction, including Sara and her stepdad, Gary, who was carrying a basket with the Tonight Show Golden Retriever puppies inside, Fallon's Tight Pants character, announcer Steve Higgins, The Tonight Show house band The Roots, The Ragtime Gals and the show's mascot Hashtag the Panda.

As guests enter the lobby in the lower level, they receive a ticket that matches one of the six colors in the NBC peacock logo. This level features displays of items from the entire history of The Tonight Show, including exhibits dedicated to each of its past hosts. Items on display include suits and desk props used by the hosts, admittance tickets from each host's tenure, and an NBC video camera used for the show's taping in the golden age, all adjacent to a display of Jimmy Fallon as the current host. Guests may continue to the upper level once the lobby's lighting changes to the color of the NBC ticket they were given. In the upper level of the queue, guests are entertained with a live performance from The Ragtime Gals barbershop quartet onstage, with screens showing Jimmy's monologues, and sketches, including \\"History of Rap\\" and \\"Lip Sync Battle\\". The queue also has interactive desks throughout the waiting area where guests can send personalized Tonight Show Thank You Notes, play retro-style Fallon video games and have a meet-and-greet with Hashtag the Panda. =Pre-show= Guests are called in to enter Studio 6B once the lighting in the upper level waiting area changes to the color of the NBC ticket they were given at the receptionist desk. After guests are ushered into the doors that lead to Studio 6B, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon begins in the screens. The show begins with its intro and music played by The Roots, with Steve Higgins announcing the guests for this episode: you (the audience) \\"and featuring the Legendary Roots Crew\\". The shot cuts to Questlove yelling \\"Universal Studios!\\" followed by Higgins introducing Jimmy Fallon. As he emerges from the curtains, studio applause lights flash, indicating the guests to do so as the show intro proceeds. After the intro ends, Fallon begins the show with a quick monologue about the sights the audience will get to see in the race through New York City and requests the help of Roots vocalist Tariq Trotter to rap about the safety precautions of the ride, instead of reciting them because \\"that's boring\\". After the applause lights flash again for The Roots, Sara and her stepdad, Gary, make an appearance as the only people in the studio audience, who later leave the studio for the ride's gift shop. After they leave, Fallon ushers guests to step inside Studio 6B to begin the race, as he returns backstage through the curtains he emerged from to board his vehicle, \\"The Tonight Rider\\" (a nod to Knight Rider, which aired on NBC). =Ride= The race through New York begins with Jimmy Fallon emerging once again from backstage through the stage curtains, this time driving \\"The Tonight Rider\\", challenging the audience to the race. The Roots can be seen to provide the music as Steve Higgins counts down the start of the race. The race begins through Studio 6B's backstage corridors, racing through NBC personnel, passing by Tight Pants and Hashtag the Panda. After almost crashing into Hashtag, Jimmy's vehicle skids through the corridor and crashes through the wall along with the audience, landing at West 50th Street between the NBC Studios marquee and Radio City Music Hall. From there, the race immediately continues through Times Square, after Jimmy crashes into a taxi driven by Travis Bickle (Fallon). The race continues under the Hard Rock Cafe marquee and heads towards the New York City Subway's Times Square‚Äì42nd Street station, where the audience encounters The Ragtime Gals singing a melody before turning to the subway tracks and almost crashing with an oncoming train (operated by Fallon). The audience gets to escape by reversing and turning into a tunnel under construction and later exiting to the first checkpoint, where Sara is crossing the street with her stepdad, Gary, who's carrying a basket full of the Tonight Show Golden Retriever puppies. Jimmy's wife, Nancy Juvonen makes a cameo appearance with their daughters, Winnie and Frances Fallon. The race now takes the skies as Jimmy's vehicle converts into a hovercraft, soaring through the city, throwing pizza to the audience and t-shirts out of a t-shirt cannon. The race goes past the Flatiron Building before diving into the East River for the second leg of the race, where a shark appears and scares Jimmy and the audience (a reference to Jaws). After resurfacing, the race reaches the Statue of Liberty for the third checkpoint. As fireworks explode around Lady Liberty, the race heads towards the Empire State Building where a giant Hashtag the Panda, trying to flick off planes, grabs the audience and shoots them straight to the moon. There, Jimmy remarks The Roots as \\"the first band on the moon\\", who are all dressed up in spacesuits. He then, asks James Poyser to play his thank you note-writing music, to write a thank you note addressed to the moon. The race reaches the Space Train, a roller coaster launcher on the moon, which is under construction, shooting both Jimmy and the audience back towards Earth. Coming in too hot, Jimmy decides to open up a hyperdrive in the form of a tube that leads directly to 30 Rock and back inside Studio 6B, where the audience wins the race after Jimmy crashes his \\"Tonight Rider\\" just before crossing the finish line. The Tonight Show's real-life stage manager, Niclana Tolmasoff, makes a cameo appearance at the end of the ride as well as one of the show's real-life writers, Mike DiCenzo, who appears as a stage crew member. =The Tonight Shop= After the ride concludes, guests exit downstairs to The Tonight Shop, with merchandise from both the ride and Fallon's Tonight Show tenure, like in the real NBC Studios in New York City.

The Tonight Show taping and the ride's opening day In anticipation to the opening of the ride, The Tonight Show was taped from Universal Studios Florida for the second time in Fallon's tenure, April 3‚Äì6, 2017. Out of his guests for the 4-day show broadcast, Fallon invited country singer Blake Shelton to experience Race Through New York, to which Shelton felt it was a punishment, admitting to having a fear of rollercoasters; both Shelton and Fallon have previously pushed each other into trying things they both dislike or have never tried such as eating sushi and milking a cow. Jimmy Fallon also invited Dwayne Johnson to go out on the streets of Universal Studios Florida, each dressed in a college mascot costume of themselves, in a competition for the most high fives, hugs and selfies taken in an amount of time, resulting in Fallon winning. They continued their stunt inside the attraction's stage to photobomb park goers in their college mascot costumes; one of them to got emotionally surprised when meeting Johnson, who was his lifelong hero. On April 6, 2017, opening day, Jimmy Fallon was paraded to the entrance of the attraction on a New York-themed float joined by Steve Higgins, The Roots, Sara's stepdad, Gary, and Hashtag the Panda, from the backlot. After giving a speech, accompanied by his wife and daughters, Fallon officially opened the attraction during the ribbon- cutting ceremony.

It was built in 1904. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 September 2011.  History  Gympie Ambulance Centre, circa 1926 Gympie (initially called Nashville) was established after the discovery of gold in October 1867 by James Nash in the Upper Mary River district. The new gold field put Queensland on the map as a significant gold producer, contributing much needed finances to the young colony. By Christmas of 1867, according to the Gold Commissioner, the Gympie field had a population of 4,000 (or over 15,000 according to James Nash). Although the alluvial deposits were quickly exhausted, from 1868 shallow reef mining occurred. As it evolved from a hastily established mining settlement, Gympie developed a distinctive character with an irregular street pattern amid a series of valleys and ridges. Development of roads within the town followed the terrain rather than adopting the standard grid pattern that was applied to townships surveyed for settlement, and consequently many roads run along ridgelines with linking roads across valleys and hillsides. Existing buildings and mining homestead leases were accommodated in the first survey of the township in April 1868. The early makeshift structures of Gympie gradually gave way to more permanent and substantial public and private buildings. By the end of the 1870s, an intensive phase of underground reef mining was underway, facilitated by the injection of share-holding capital into mining companies for machinery and employees. During the early 1880s mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie. The Gympie goldfield passed through its most profitable period from 1901 to 1906 and in 1903 produced its peak annual output. After 1906 production declined and by 1925 the last of the big mines had ceased operations, ending a 50-year phase of deep reef mining in Gympie. Community based ambulance services first appeared in Queensland from the 1890s. In 1892, concerns regarding the lack of adequate medical aid for accident victims led to the establishment of the City Ambulance Transport Brigade in Brisbane, the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade (QATB) from 1902. The objective of the brigade was to provide first aid and to transport sick and injured people to hospital. During the early 1900s, ambulance brigades were established in regional centres throughout Queensland - Charters Towers and Townsville (1900), Rockhampton, Warwick and Ipswich (1901), Ravenswood, Gympie and Toowoomba (1902), Mackay (1903), Cairns (1904) and Bundaberg (1907). While some were affiliated with the QATB, others were established independently. The goldfields of Charters Towers, Ravenswood and Gympie, with large working populations of miners, were among the first to establish ambulance services in the state. The earliest provision of ambulance services began in Gympie in 1890, with the establishment of the Wide Bay Gympie Ambulance Corps, a volunteer arm of the Wide Bay and Burnett Division of the Queensland Defence Force. In addition to their military based activities, the corps also provided a civic service. In 1898, the corps was disbanded. Subsequent efforts by former members to establish an ambulance service, including an attempt to have Gympie's miners subscribe were unsuccessful until a public meeting in September 1902 resolved to \\"form a local Ambulance Brigade Hospital\\". A Gympie Ambulance Transport Brigade Committee (GATBC) and subscription list were established by the end of proceedings. By the end of September, Superintendent Fred Roffe had attended to his first case (a fractured forearm). Initially the ambulance service was conducted from a room in the Atlantic Hotel in Mary Street. Later, the service moved its plant of one first aid kit and a stretcher to a room at the Gympie Fire Station in Bligh St. Prior to the brigade establishing their own premises, the personnel grew to include 16 honorary bearers while the plant increased to four stretchers. In April 1903, the provisions of the Hospitals Act were extended to include the Gympie Brigade, meaning that community subscriptions were matched by government funding. By early 1904, the Gympie Ambulance Transport Brigade (GATB) had acquired unoccupied land on Crown Road to build an ambulance station and superintendent's quarters. In March, the tender of Messrs Stuart and Poynton to erect a station for was accepted. The architect is unknown. The station was officially opened on May 18, 1904, with Gympie Mayor Gilbert Garrick raising the Red Cross flag and handing out St John's Ambulance Association training certificates to brigade members. The new station building was a simple rectangular gable ended timber structure with an office, lecture room and plant room (used to store stretchers and equipment) facing the entrance off Crown Road. The superintendent's residence was located next to the station. Many early ambulance buildings in Queensland followed the station layout first established at the 1897 Wharf Street headquarters of the QATB; a two-storey building incorporating ambulance service facilities at ground level and living quarters at the upper level, and large ground floor openings with bi-fold doors to allow ready access directly to the street for quick exit. While the Gympie building included the ground-floor provisions of a large front entrance, plant and other rooms for staff facilities, its single storey timber construction and detached superintendent's residence differed from other early stations. Early stations in Warwick and Ipswich also shared these characteristics. The station's location was an important consideration for the Brigade when first established. The building now sits in a quiet suburban area, but when built was in close proximity to some of Gympie's largest mine headworks, and was conveniently positioned between the CBD and the One Mile and Monkland mining areas. In 1904 there were 1723 miners employed in Gympie. Accident data from the Department of Mines from the early 1900s amply demonstrates the range of occupational hazards (including defective explosives, rockfalls and machinery accidents) which led to injury or death for men working in Gympie's gold mines. In the period where the ambulance station attended to mining related cases there were 37 mining deaths and numerous accidents on the Gympie goldfield. The Gympie brigade used a special \\"Scott Tracy\\" stretcher, fitted with leather straps to vertically raise miners from underground. In 1910 the Queensland Governor Sir William MacGregor visited the station and was treated to a demonstration on how the stretcher was used. A 1911 photo shows the Gympie Brigade formally posed outside the station with the stretcher. On 1 June 1905, the Ambulance Brigade's Crown Road site (Portion 8 Gympie Gold Field) was formerly gazetted as an Ambulance Brigade Reserve. In its first year of operating from their new premises the GATB attended to 655 patients. After receiving first-aid at the station, patients were either taken home, to a doctor's residence or to the Gympie hospital if further treatment was required. Bearers also transported patients who arrived to Gympie by rail from outlying areas such as Wondai and Cooroy. Demand for the service grew steadily during its first decade. Gympie's earliest ambulance bearers walked or ran to attend to cases, carrying patients on stretchers and later on litters (two-wheeled stretchers) to the station or hospital for treatment. Bearers often travelled long distances on shifts, especially when attending to cases in rural areas outside of Gympie. While the use of a horse and sulky from mid-1912 made travelling to callouts easier, patients were still transported by litter into Gympie. 1912 was also the year a second paid officer began working for the brigade. A building to house the sulky and litters and a horse stable were erected behind the station at this time. The brigade acquired its first motor ambulance in 1917 and an awning had been added to the front of the station building by 1918. The purchase of a second car in 1920 effectively rendered the horse and sulky service obsolete. In 1920-21, the Brigade pulled down the 1912 litter shed and replaced the 1904 superintendent's residence with a single-skin, timber framed cottage with a pyramid roof, connected to the ambulance station by a walkway. In early 1922 further improvements were undertaken to the station building. By September 1921, the brigade was in possession of three cars, and a lack of storage space in the front plant room determined the decision to add an annex to the station. The brigade's use of the plant room at this time to store cars indicates that by 1921 the original front office space had been removed and replaced by an entrance door. The Brigade's monthly meeting in January 1922 resolved to extend along the length of the south end of the station, with a frontage of , and a roof carried out on the same pitch as the 1904 building. Construction was underway by February and completed by May at a cost of . In 1923, the brigade began considering the purchase of an additional car and the construction of a new maintenance shed. In January 1924, the tender of AC McKennan of /10 for the erection of the maintenance shed, a simple gable roofed timber structure, was accepted. Following a deputation from the Queensland Ambulance Transport Brigade in late 1922, the GATB voted to affiliate with the state body from 1 Jan 1923. By this time the QATB was composed of 44 centres across the state, with 17 centres opening in the previous two and a half years. Under a mutual transfer system, Gympie ambulance staff went to QATB headquarters in Brisbane for further training in first aid, mechanical and business skills. Lewis Dean succeeded Frederick Roffe as Superintendent from August 1921 and continued to hold the position until 1969 (thought to be a world record in ambulance service). The wives of Superintendents who lived on-site at the residence fulfilled important duties related to the ambulance service, remaining on-call when other members of the brigade were out, answering telephone calls and providing basic first aid when injured people called at the station. By 1941 calls had begun for a modern ambulance station for Gympie. In 1943 the Brigade Committee investigated building a new station on the Crown Road site, but financial restrictions prevented this from occurring. Subsequently, a building fund was established for a new station and the brigade began looking for suitable sites. In 1948, the ambulance station measured , indicating the rear of the building was extended sometime after 1922. Internally, the building included the plant (front) room and four other rooms - a first aid/casualty room, superintendent's office, staff bedroom and a larger multi-purpose room. As late as 1954 the brigade were intending to pull down the station building at Crown Rd and erect a new station and living quarters. However, by November 1955, the brigade had acquired land on Nash Street in Gympie's CBD to build the new station and residence and requested the Crown Road reserve be rescinded. While this occurred in December 1955, the brigade remained at the site for another four years. The new Gympie Ambulance Station was opened in 1959, ending 55 years of use of the original station at Crown Road. By this time the Gympie Ambulance service had attended to 11,735 patients and had travelled over 1.85 million kilometres. Since the removal of the ambulance service in 1959, the station building and house have been used for residential purposes and have been home to the Bowen family since 1987. Over this period some alterations have occurred to the former station building. The front entrance bi-fold doors have been reconstructed. To mark the Gympie Ambulance Service centenary celebrations in 2002, the front awning and finial were reconstructed, replacing the originals that had been removed. In the rooms at the rear of the building, some walls and ceilings have been lined with asbestos cement sheeting. Following a mine capping excavation project in 1992 a besser block understorey was installed beneath the building. On the northern side of the building a window has been replaced by a door and a (temporary) external balcony has been added to the rear. Alterations that have occurred to the former superintendent's residence include room and kitchen reconfiguration and verandah and rear deck extensions. A lean-to has been added to the maintenance shed. While some changes have occurred, the station building survives as important evidence from the early period of expansion of ambulance services in Queensland. Only two other stations from this period-at Charters Towers (1903) and Ravenswood (1904) (Ravenswood Ambulance Station)-are known to exist.  Description  The former Gympie Ambulance Station complex, including the ambulance station, garage and superintendent's residence, occupies a corner site bound by Crown Road and Stanley Street in a quiet residential area in the south of Gympie. The site slopes away to the west with the ambulance station and residence fronting Crown Road and the maintenance shed down the slope and accessed from Stanley Street. The ambulance station, a timber-framed and clad building, is sheltered by a gabled roof with a lean-to the south. A large street awning shelters the wide entry doors facing the street. A concrete driveway slightly wider than the front of the building extends to the road crossover. The ambulance station is planned around a large garage space facing Crown Road with smaller scale rooms to the south and rear. A lean-to roofed annex runs along the southern side of the building. The roofs are clad in recent corrugated metal sheeting. Eaves are unlined and eaves gutters are quad-profile. Wide entry doors consisting of two pairs of hinged ledged doors with strap hinges open out from the main volume to the street which is accessed via a wide driveway. The front opening is sheltered by a timber-framed footpath awning which is supported on timber posts and clad in corrugated metal sheeting. Decorative elements in the main elevation include a circular vent and a simple finial on the gable end. The main building is clad in chamferboards and the lean-to annex to the south is clad in weatherboards. Multi-paned windows sheltered by recent timber framed window awnings are located along the south elevation. A paneled door opens from the upper level leading out to recent timber framed staircase that run along the side of the building and provide access to the lower level. External walls are clad in weatherboard. The rear end of the gabled roof is visible on the western elevation where a temporary balcony has recently been constructed. The gable end is clad in chamferboard and features a square vent. Multi-paned windows are also located on this elevation together with a recent timber-framed window awning. The lower level of the building where the land slopes away has recently been enclosed with blockwork. This recent work is not considered to be of heritage significance. The northern elevation of the ambulance building adjoins the adjacent former ambulance superintendent's residence. This elevation is clad in weatherboards and is linked to the residence with a timber-framed deck platform. A multi-paned double-hung window with a timber- framed awning opens from the main volume internally. A recent entry door and temporary screens have been added. This recent work is not considered to be of heritage significance. The garage within the ambulance station is a lofty space with the ceiling partly lined on the rake with v-jointed boards laid horizontally. The floor is mostly lined with tongue and groove boards. Two sections underneath where vehicles park is lined with unsealed hardwood shot- edge boards. A large archway frames an opening into the adjacent annex. Quad- profile trims are featured on the ceiling panels and trim the wall junctions. Simple pendant lights hang from the ceiling where a single ventilation inlet in-filled with fretwork is located. The annex has similar finishes to the main garage room with ceilings lined on the rake with horizontally laid v-jointed boards. Walls are also lined with horizontally laid v-jointed boards. Rooms to the rear of the ambulance building have been lined with asbestos cement sheeting to both walls and ceilings. Ceilings to these rooms are lower and flat. Tongue and groove boards are visible on the floors in some of the rear rooms with some floors lined with carpet and linoleum. The former maintenance shed is a timber-framed structure with a gabled roof. It is clad in weatherboards and has a corrugated metal roof. A decorative metal roof ventilator is located on the ridge. A small ledged entry door is located on the north elevation and a pair of large ledged doors opens to the street to the south. Three shuttered windows are located on the east elevation while an awning window and a small ledged door is located on the west elevation where a timber- framed lean-to roof has been added. Simple timber finials adorn each gable end. Internally walls and ceilings are unlined and un-painted and the floor is formed from concrete. The former superintendent's residence is a single-skin, timber-framed cottage sheltered by a pyramid roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. A decorative roof vent crowns the peak of the roof. Verandahs run to the east and north. A range of work has been undertaken to the building including enclosure of the western part of the north verandah, addition of lattice to the east verandah, insertion of new openings, linings to partitions and verandah ceilings and an extension to the rear. As a consequence, the building contains a mix of new and early fabric. The interior and the rear extension are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The significance of this structure is in its presence on Crown Road alongside the ambulance station. The ambulance complex buildings are located in a lush suburban garden shaded by semi-mature street trees and boundaries are fenced with recent timber pickets.  Heritage listing  The former Gympie Ambulance Station was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 16 September 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Gympie Ambulance Station is important in demonstrating the development of ambulance services in Queensland. The establishment of civic ambulance services in regional Queensland centres began in the first decade of the 1900s, a pattern of development that continued during the 20th century. The purpose-built 1904 station building is among the earliest known surviving ambulance stations from this initial phase of establishment. Only two other examples, at Charters Towers (1903) and Ravenswood (1904) (Ravenswood Ambulance Station) are still in existence. Additions undertaken during the building's use as an ambulance station (1904-1959) including the annex (1922), maintenance shed (1924) and rear extensions (pre-1948) provide important evidence of the evolution of Queensland ambulance services, illustrating the transition from the use of foot travel to motorised transport and growth in demand of the service. The Gympie Ambulance Station (former) is important in demonstrating the early role of gold mining towns in developing ambulance services in Queensland. Established during the peak years of Gympie's gold production, the station's historical setting, close to large mine headworks and centrally positioned between the centre of town and the One Mile and Monkland areas, illustrates the influence of mining in determining its location. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The earliest known surviving timber building of its type, the former Gympie Ambulance Station is important in demonstrating the evolution of the principal characteristics of purpose-built ambulance stations during the twentieth century. The building's provision of large front entrances with ready road access from the plant room to facilitate quick exit and internal rear rooms for staff facilities illustrate the functions of the station. Additions undertaken during the building's use as an ambulance station (1904-1959), including the annex (1922), maintenance shed (1924) and rear room extensions (pre-1948), and the detached superintendent's residence (1920‚Äì21), are important in illustrating the changing requirements of ambulance services over time.

The first Ghanaian woman to become a lawyer, she was also the first woman in Ghana and the Commonwealth of Nations to become a judge. She was a principal drafter of the Declaration on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women and a co-founder of the organisation that became Women's World Banking. Early life and education Annie Ruth Baeta was born on 7 October 1918 in Lom√©, French Togoland. Her parents were schoolteacher, Henrietta Ba√´ta and Presbyterian minister, Robert Domingo Ba√´ta. She belonged to the Ewe ethnic group of southeastern Ghana and Togo. A member of the notable Ba√´ta family, she was one of eight children, though only Annie and her siblings Christian, Lily, and William lived to adulthood. Her older brother, Christian Ba√´ta was an academic and Presbyterian minister who was elected the Synod Clerk of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast from 1945 to 1949 and was instrumental in the establishment of the University of Ghana, Legon in 1948. Her parents wanted her to have an English education and she lived in the coastal town of Keta (then in British Togoland) with her maternal grandmother. Baeta attended Achimota College and earned her teacher's certificate in 1937. She was Headmistress and Schoolteacher at the Evangelical Presbyterian Girls School from 1940 to 1946. After the buildings of the Evangelical Presbyterian School for Girls were washed away by the ocean in 1940, the girls were moved to the Evangelical Presbyterian School for Boys. The school was overcrowded, and Baeta knew it would be difficult to find funding for new buildings. She approached the Evangelical Presbyterian Church Choir and transformed it into a drama group that put on the George F. Rool musical David the Shepherd Boy. The performances were successful and the group was invited to perform in major Gold Coast cities and in Togo. Baeta was able to raise funds for a new school for the girls that was built by December 1945. =Studies in London= Baeta's time with the Evangelical Presbyterian Girls School was fulfilling but left her restless. She passed the London Matriculation Examination in 1945. Her elder brother Christian made inquiries to the University of London on her behalf and her mother secured loans for her. She was admitted to the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1946. Her male colleagues from the Gold Coast urged her to abandon her studies, thinking them too difficult for a woman. One offered to arrange a position for her at the Paris Academy to study dress design. She told them she would return to the Gold Coast if she didn't pass her first examination. She passed, and was no longer bothered by the men. She received her LLB in 1949 and was called to the Bar at Lincoln's Inn the following year. Ba√´ta also participated in religious and social work during her free time in London. She worked with youth camps organised by the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) and was elected to the Executive Committee of the World YWCA during her final years as a student. Legal career, women's rights activism and legacy Baeta established a private practice upon her return to the Gold Coast in 1950. She led a public relations initiative to establish a national YWCA for the colony and a documentary film was produced as part of the drive to educate the public about the organisation. Baeta married Fred Jiagge on 10 January 1953. She gave up the Bar and became a magistrate for the Bench in June 1953. In 1954, she began regularly attending the conferences of the World Council of Churches. From 1955 to 1960, she was president of the YWCA. She and her husband adopted a child, Rheinhold, in 1959. In 1959, she became a judge for the Circuit Court. After learning of a young woman who was raped in Accra after coming there from the countryside for a job interview, Jiagge sought government assistance to provide safe accommodations for visiting women. She secured an audience with Ghanaian president Kwame Nkrumah and convinced him of the project's importance. She spearheaded a successful campaign in 1961 that raised substantial funds for a YWCA women's hostel. That year she became a judge of the High Court of Justice. From 1961 to 1976 she was a council member of the University of Ghana. In 1962 she was appointed to represent Ghana on the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women. She was asked to chair the Commission to Investigate the Assets of Senior Public Servants and Named Political Leaders in 1966. She championed women's rights through her work at the United Nations, representing Ghana through 1972. In 1966, she was elected rapporteur of the Commission. During a meeting in Iran in 1967, the Commission was charged with preparing a document on the elimination of discrimination against women. Worried that a draft wouldn't be finished by the time they left Iran, Jiagge met other members of the team, including Iranian Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, and drafted the document in a single night. It was sent to UN member- states for comment and was later adopted. The Declaration was an important precursor to the legally binding 1979 Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Jiagge was elected chair of the Commission's 21st session in 1968. Jiagge was awarded the Grand Medal of Ghana and the Gimbles International Award for Humanitarian Works in 1969. She was named a judge of the Court of Appeal that same year, the highest court in Ghana at the time. She was the first female judge of the Court of Appeal. She was awarded an honorary law degree from the University of Ghana in 1974. In 1975, she founded the Ghana National Council on Women and Development and was its first chair. As chair, she convened a meeting of Ghanaian women to learn their views on Equality, Development and Peace, the theme of the 1975 International Women's Conference in Mexico. She learned that access to credit was a priority for her country's women and led Ghana's delegation to the conference. She and others pledged seed money for a women's bank, and the organisation Stitching to Promote Women's World Banking (now Women's World Banking) was founded and headquartered in New York. She later served on the board of Women's World Banking in Ghana. Jiagge also served as a president of the World Council of Churches from 1975 to 1983. In 1979, she was a member of the constituent assembly which wrote the constitution of the Ghana's Third Republic. She was the World Council of Churches' moderator for their Programme to Combat Racism from 1984 to 1991 and mobilised against South Africa's system of apartheid. Jiagge was appointed President of the Court of Appeal in 1980. That year she led the Ghanaian delegation again to the International Women's Conference in Copenhagen. She remained President of the Court of Appeal until her retirement in 1983. She helped plan the Fourth World Conference on Women as a member of the UN Secretary-General's advisory group that year. In 1985 she served on a United Nations panel that conducted Public Hearings on the Activities of Transnational Corporations in South Africa and Namibia. She also served on the Committee of Experts who drafted Ghana's Constitution in 1991. From 1993 until her death, Jiagge served on Ghana's Council of State. She died on 12 June 1996 in Accra. The Justice Annie Jiagge Memorial Lectures were established by the Ministry of Women and Children in 2009. A boarding house, the Annie Ba√´ta Jiagge House, formerly, House 17, at her alma mater, Achimota School was named in her memory in recognition of her role as a trailblazer in the legal profession in Ghana.

Rajasthan was the first state in the country to submit State Annual Action Plan under Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT). The scheme Housing for All by 2022 and Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) were launched on the same day. The scheme is dependent with public‚Äìprivate partnership(PPP) model. If required, various other schemes like Swachh Bharat Mission, Housing for All 2022, along with the local state schemes like that related to water supply and sewerage and other infrastructure related schemes can be linked to AMRUT. Mission The purpose of Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) is to (i) ensure that every household has access to a tap with assured supply of water and a sewerage connection; (ii) increase the amenity value of cities by developing greenery and well maintained open spaces (e.g. parks); and (iii) reduce pollution by switching to public transport or constructing facilities for non-motorized transport (e.g.walking and cycling). Finance About investment on urban development under Smart Cities Mission and the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation of 500 cities has already been approved by the government. Eligibility SAAP(State Annual Action Plans) is a consolidated plan of all the city level SLIPs(Service Level Improvement Plan) of all proposed AMRUT cities in the respective states. A formulation on City level SLIP is done based on diligent estimation of ambiguities in the availability of infrastructure like water supply, sewerage network, draining system, transportation facilities, available digital and internet facilities, industrial facilities etc. 135litres per capita per day is another factor in the process including water supply and sewerage connections to all urban households.  Targets  Some of the broad targets of AMRUT scheme are ascertaining that every one has access to tap water and sewerage facilities, greenery like parks and open spaces are well maintained, digital and smart facilities like weather prediction, internet and WiFi facilities, pollution reduction by encouraging the public for using cheaper but secure public transport etc. Implementation =First Phase Implementation= 90 cities in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Rajasthan have been allocated funds under the first phase of the mission. A huge allocation of fund has been done for them by the Apex Committee of AMRUT under the State Annual Action Plans (SAAP) for these states for period of 2015-16. At each city level a City Mission Management Units (CMMUs) is proposed to be set up which will assist the Urban Local Body (ULB) in terms of staff and technology. =Later Phase= The flagship program has already invited a huge fund and participation of big companies. In later stage the rest of the cities out of 500 will be finalized and implemented for the next phase. State Progress = West Bengal = Jangipur (Lok Sabha constituency) is a parliamentary constituency in Murshidabad district in the Indian state of West Bengal. The city is approved as for AMRUT project recently. = Andhra Pradesh = Amaravati, the new capital of the state, has been included under the AMRUT scheme. The work for planning was started to fulfill the different criteria like sewerage system, 135 litres per capita per day etc. =Haryana= Under the AMRUT the state government has announced to provide with the cities and 18 ULBs(Urban Local Bodies), facilities including water supply, sewerage connection and development of greenery. The scheme has also been linked with the flagship program Swachh Bharat Mission. =Jammu and Kashmir= Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC) is working with professionals sent from the center under AMRUT mission and workshops are being organized regarding the management and funding of the scheme. = Maharashtra = The state government has announced 43 cities in the state which are aimed at urban transformation and will be undertaken for 5 years. = Madhya Pradesh = The state government has submitted SAAP Plan to improve the infrastructure including water connections and sewerage network in 34 mission cities under AMRUT.

It was written by series developers/creators Greg Berlanti, Ali Adler and Andrew Kreisberg, and directed by Glen Winter. The Supergirl pilot details the origins of Kryptonian Kara Zor-El, whose quest to follow in her famous cousin's footsteps would emerge while maintaining a mild mannered life as Kara Danvers. The episode received positive reviews, especially for the performance of the series' star Melissa Benoist. It also became CBS' most watched new series of the 2015-16 television season, and the most watched new scripted series overall by Nielsen, with 12.9 million viewers tuning in and an estimated 19 million over the next week, once delayed viewing is tabulated. It also gave CBS its first successful series to target a younger demo in the 18-49 age group, which is favored by advertiser groups. Plot Kara Zor-El is sent by her parents, Alura and Zor-El, from Krypton to Earth to watch over her infant cousin, Kal-El. Krypton explodes, knocking Kara‚Äôs pod off-course into the Phantom Zone. She remains frozen in time for 24 years before her pod crashes to Earth. Kal-El, now Superman, rescues Kara and takes her to live with Eliza and Jeremiah Danvers, the scientists who helped him come into his powers, and their daughter Alex. Twelve years later in National City, Kara Danvers is as an assistant to Cat Grant, the head of mega-media conglomerate CatCo. About to board a flight to Geneva, Alex believes Kara should remain normal, despite Kara's yearning to use her powers. After a news report reveals Alex‚Äôs plane is about to crash, Kara uses her powers for the first time in years, saving the plane. As Kara wonders if she could become a hero like her cousin, Alex worries Kara is putting herself in danger. Kara reveals her secret to co-worker Winn Schott, who helps Kara perfect her abilities and designs her a uniform. As a public hero, Kara is dubbed \\"Supergirl\\" by Cat Grant, unaware of her true identity. Vartox, the alien responsible for the attempted plane crash, learns of Supergirl‚Äôs actions. Kara is shot down by a tranquilizer containing Kryptonite and brought to the secret headquarters of the Department of Extra-Normal Operations (DEO), where Alex is revealed to work. Director Hank Henshaw informs Kara that when she landed on Earth, Fort Rozz ‚Äì a prison housing some of Krypton's worst criminals, most of whom were sentenced by Kara‚Äôs mother ‚Äì crashed onto Earth as well. Nearly killed by Vartox, Kara worries she is not yet ready to be Supergirl, but Alex convinces her to follow in Superman‚Äôs footsteps. Challenging Vartox to a rematch, Kara causes his axe to explode with her heat vision before he commits suicide. Her actions convince Hank that Supergirl, with help from Alex, can be useful to the DEO. CatCo's new art director, James Olsen, reveals to Kara that he knows her secret identity, and passes on a gift: an indestructible cape made from Kal-El's baby wrappings. In another part of the universe, news of Vartox's death reaches his commander, revealed to be General Astra, Alura's identical twin sister and Kara's aunt, who plans to take over Earth and kill Kara. Production The plant where Supergirl and Vartox first do battle was shot in San Pedro, California but the producers' plan to extend the fight scene beyond the plant was scrapped. The rematch scene took two days of filming in the Mojave Desert. The producers also note that Alex Danvers was created for the series, as she does not exist in the comic series. The producers also enlisted real-life Los Angeles news reporter Rick Garcia and Leyna Nguyen to make cameo appearances in this episode, and plan to utilize more media news talent from the Los Angeles area in the series.\\"Supergirl:Pilot\\" from CBS.com (October 27, 2015) The twist in the final scene featuring Astra was a last minute addition by the producers, as she was also created for the television series, along with her background that featured another Kryptonian House without the \\"S\\" in its shield, which will also add to Kara's family background in future episodes. =Casting= In January 2015, it was announced that Melissa Benoist had been cast as Supergirl. Reception =Ratings= More than 12.96 million viewers tuned in to see the episode, making it one of CBS' most watch scripted dramas of the night and of this season, tying it with NBC's Blindspot as the top-rated series premiere of the 2015-16 fall season. The episode attracted 1,606,000 viewers for its British premiere, making it the most watched programme on Sky One for the week. =Critical response= The episode received positive reviews, praising Melissa Benoist's take on the character and the well scripted storyline. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a B-, and notes in his assessment of the review, \\"I‚Äôm glad Supergirl exists and I want it to succeed. If it never becomes anything more than a solid superhero genre show with a female lead, that‚Äôs more than fine, especially since that lead is fantastic: The best counter to all my complaints is that Benoist makes it all work. The redeeming magic of perfect casting. Her performance embraces, internalizes, and sells the character‚Äôs contradictions and paradoxes. She makes Kara feel real, she wears the costume proudly and easily, she‚Äôs joy and complexity at once. Supergirl begins to fill a shameful void that needs to be followed with cleaner, more artful wins. It will most likely come from original creations ‚Äî the next Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the next Veronica Mars ‚Äî or adaptations of edgier, more contemporary properties that can allow for more creative daring, like The CW‚Äôs excellent iZombie or (hopefully) the upcoming Netflix series, Marvel‚Äôs Jessica Jones. The frustrations of Supergirl remind us that super-powered super-people often make for problematic vehicles for exploring issues of Otherness, diversity, race and gender ‚Äì especially intrinsically flawed comic book brands beholden to the values of another era and bound by franchise restrictions. ‚ÄúCan you believe it? A female hero. Nice for my daughter to have someone like that to look up to.‚Äù Yes, that is nice. Now, we need better.\\" Cliff Wheatley of IGN gave the pilot episode a 7/10, praising Melissa Benoist's performance as Kara and the fun take on the Superman mythos. In a review from The Hollywood Reporter, Daniel Feinberg said, \\"CBS' Supergirl shouldn't have to be a feminist landmark, but it is.\\" Caroline Siede of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review, giving it a B. With the exception of the Kara backstory, she was pleased with the executed fast pace of how well the episode was structured: \\"While Supergirl is a little more grounded than The Flash, this premiere establishes the show‚Äôs appropriately upbeat tone and sets up more than enough threads to explore across its first 13 episodes‚Äîand hopefully many more to come.\\" Stacy Glanzman of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 5.0 out of 5 stars.\\"Supergirl Season 1 Episode 1 Review: Pilot\\" from TV Fanatic (October 26, 2015) References External links * Category:2015 American television episodes Pilot Supergirl Category:Television episodes about adoption ","title":"Pilot (Supergirl)"},{"id":"48392667","text":"Clifton is an unincorporated locale in Hood River County, Oregon, United States.

It was designed by Hugo Durietz and built from 1881 to 1885. It is also known as Goldsworthy Building, Caston and Davidson Building, and Sym and Jackson Building. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 July 2011.  History  The former Crawford and Co Building located at 216 Mary Street, Gympie is a two storey, masonry building with basement that was erected in two stages during the 1880s. The second storey was designed by Hugo Durietz in 1885 for James Crawford, who in partnership with Ernest Rohda, conducted his mining, commission agent and share broking business from this building until 1889. Thereafter, the building continued to be occupied by mining secretaries until when the mining industry in Gympie was in serious decline. Gympie was settled after the discovery of gold in the Mary River district in October 1867. The new goldfield established Queensland as a significant gold producer, contributing much needed finances to the young colony. Thousands of people arrived at the Gympie goldfield in the months after the discovery and a fledgling settlement emerged. In a year the alluvial gold had been exhausted and shallow reef mining commenced. Deep reef mining commenced in 1875 requiring extensive capital investment achieved through the formation of companies. During 1881 mines began yielding large amounts of gold, marking a new era of wealth and prosperity for Gympie as an intensive phase of underground reef mining began, facilitated by the injection of capital into mining companies for machinery and employees. As Gympie evolved from a hastily established mining settlement, the early makeshift structures of the 1860s gradually gave way to more permanent and substantial public and private buildings from the mid 1870s. The success of deep reef mining from 1875 was reflected in the redevelopment of upper Mary Street during the 1880s and 1890s with substantial commercial buildings such as banks and company secretary and brokers' offices. Several fires ‚Äì in 1877, 1881 and 1891 ‚Äì razed the earlier timber buildings and accelerated this transformation. A fire in August 1881 destroyed all of the buildings between Patterson's brick store and the Bank of New South Wales (242 Mary Street) on the south-western side of Mary Street, Gympie. This included the timber building that had stood on the site of the present-day Crawford and Co Building and which may have been occupied by Samuel Caston, sharebroker, mining secretary and commission agent. Sometime between August 1881 and 1885 a one-storey masonry building was erected. In October 1885 the property was purchased for by James Crawford, mining secretary, who commissioned architect Hugo Durietz to make additions to the building. The resultant two storey facade is in a Victorian classical style. On 2 March 1889 The Queenslander's Travelling Correspondent described the building of Messrs James Crawford and Co as \\"most conspicuous, not merely on account of its height, but principally owing to its very elegant and attractive proportions\\". To him it was: \\"the most handsome building on the field. Two stories [sic] high with stone front, and tastily ornamented ... the keystones of the main door and window are ornamented with splendidly executed casts of two of Scotland's most popular bards, Burns and Scott; between the lower and upper windows there is a beautifully-worked scroll, the tracery of which interlaces representations of Scotch thistles; and the whole is surmounted by a parapet of bold and attractive designs. On each side of the parapet the British lion, rampant-while rising from the top are models of the emu and kangaroo with shields showing Australia's coat of arms.\\" This exterior decoration of the Crawford and Co Building represented several cultural influences ‚Äì the British Empire (lions), Scotland (thistle), the nascent movement towards federation of the Australian colonies which was gaining momentum during the 1880s (kangaroo and emu) and the literary tastes of the owner (Burns and Scott). The same Queenslander correspondent also described the interior of the building as well planned with ample room for Messrs J Crawford and Co's large broking business. Extensive deep reef mining in Gympie during the 1880s and 1890s made Gympie Queensland's second and then third biggest gold producer (after Mount Morgan gold production overtook it in 1887). During this period gold production contributed between 21.61 and 35.53 percent of Queensland's export income. However, the development of deep reef mining required enormous capital. The gold mining industry was the major capital-using sector of the colonial economy. This necessitated company formation to raise capital through sale of shares. The increase in production led to an upsurge in company formation on a massive scale. This growth in gold-mining shares led to the formation of the Gympie Stock Exchange, which specialised completely in trading mining shares. The presence of sharebrokers engaged in share trading at the Gympie Stock Exchange and of mining secretaries involved in the administration of mines were the natural consequence. Mining secretaries, like company secretaries, ensured that the mining company they represented complied with relevant legislation and regulation, and they kept board members informed of their legal responsibilities. Mining secretaries were the company's named representative on legal documents, and it was their responsibility to ensure that the company and its directors operated within the law. It was also their responsibility to register and communicate with shareholders, to ensure that dividends were paid and company records maintained, such as lists of directors and shareholders, and annual accounts. Sharebrokers were necessary for every transaction on the Gympie Stock Exchange as transactions must be made between two members of the exchange. James Crawford, mining secretary and sharebroker, arrived in Gympie in 1879 and quickly won the confidence and respect of investors. He was elected to the Gympie Municipal Council in 1887 and held a number of other public positions such as membership of the Gympie Hospital Committee. However, in August 1889 James Crawford was arrested on a charge of forgery brought by William Davies, who was the director of several mining companies, and to whom Crawford was related by marriage. A Welshman, William Davies was one of the most successful investors on the Gympie goldfield. He arrived in Gympie in the early 1870s and invested in the Lady Mary line of reef, which proved successful. Thereafter he was involved in almost every mine of importance, with his chief interests being in 1 North Glanmire, 4 North Phoenix, Great Eastern and North Smithfield mines. He served on many directorates, was a member of the Widgee Divisional Board, was one of the first directors of the Gympie Gas Company and was also one of the founders of the Royal Bank of Queensland. After James Crawford fled to South Africa in 1889 to escape his trial the building at 216 Mary Street passed to William Davies to whom Crawford had mortgaged it in 1887. Thereafter, the building was rented to other mining secretaries and stockbrokers viz Caston and Davidson (circa1890-circa1914) and then Sym and Jackson (circa1914-circa1919). Substantial changes in the Queensland mining sector occurred between 1900 and 1913. Gold production in Queensland peaked in 1903, due largely to a final burst of production at Gympie, which was followed by a 60 percent decrease in production between 1903 and 1913 as Gympie (and the other two major Queensland goldfields Charters Towers and Mount Morgan) declined simultaneously. The Gympie field passed through its most profitable period from 1901 to 1906 and in 1903 it recorded an output of 146,000 fine ounces (surpassing Mount Morgan that year). After 1906 the decline that had set in at Gympie in 1904 accelerated. This downturn in gold production forced the closure of the Stock Exchange . Sharebrokers and mining secretaries declined in number as gold mining companies ceased operations. Thomas H Sym whose name, with that of his partner, Jackson, appeared on the parapet of the building was a mining secretary and sharebroker who died during 1925. Thereafter, the building was occupied by optometrists, commencing with William John Hodson who purchased the building in 1924, then Joseph Tilley, followed by Arthur Carvosso (from 1933) and then Peter Goldsworthy who purchased the property in 1973. It continues in this usage. Additions to the rear were constructed in the 1930s and the upper storey was converted from offices to living space. Also during the 1930s a partition wall between the two rear offices of the 1880s building was removed and some partition walls installed. These partitions were removed in the mid-1970s. In the late 1970s the upper storey reverted to office space with the removal of its kitchen and it has since been used for storage. In 1985 posts were added under the floor as the joists that spanned the full width of the building had sagged. During 1986‚Äì87 rotten floorboards on the ground level were replaced and loose plasterwork was repaired or replaced. Other repairs have included: reinstatement of the partition wall between the two offices; replacement of a window in the original rear wall with a reproduction; replacement of step treads in the cedar staircase; replacement of damaged and missing plaster cornice with replica cornice and replacement of the iron roof with Zincalume. The building's address to Reef Street, which gave the only means of accessing the rear of the building, has been retained.  Description  The former Crawford and Co Building is a two storey building with basement built to the front and side alignments of a narrow allotment that extends between Mary and Reef Streets. The building is one of a group of Gympie gold-mining buildings dating from the late nineteenth century on the southern side of the upper slope of Mary Street in Gympie's central business district. It has load-bearing masonry walls supporting a timber-framed roof and floors. Its gabled roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting is concealed behind parapet walls. An elevated timber framed and clad single storey addition is located at the rear of the building and has access to Reef Street. The former Crawford and Co Building has an ornamental and eclectic Victorian facade featuring many characteristics of the Renaissance style of architecture including pediments, balustraded parapets and low-relief pilasters symmetrically composed around its vertical axis. Each floor space of the building is clearly articulated in the layout of the facade. The impression of strength and solidity is given by a decorative rendered finish. Rusticated quoining has been applied to each end of the building's upper floor and the lower floor has been lined out in imitation of stone ashlar. The entrance door and window opening on the ground floor are arched and feature casts of the heads (of Burns and Scott) on the key stones. A decorative string course with low-relief scrolls interspersed with rosette motifs spans the building between the upper and lower windows. Window openings on the upper floor containing double hung timber framed sashes are rectangular and crested with pediments supported on decorative scroll brackets. A single winged acroteria remains on the corner of the easternmost pediment. Deep reveals are created with moulded architraves and Scotch thistle motifs are etched below each window sill and framed by short low relief pilasters. The parapet features a deep ornamental cornice supported with scroll-shaped brackets and short balusters set between moulded rails. Surmounting the parapet are raised plinths supporting symbolic statues of a kangaroo (north-western end) and an emu (north-eastern end) with shields housing Australia's coat of arms. A centrally placed monumental pediment, which may once have housed a clockface, is decorated with the British lion, scrolls, low relief pilasters, rosettes and features a carved Scotch thistle at its peak. The rear parapet wall has a thin rendered finish through which brickwork courses are visible. Within the masonry wall are a triangular window located at the apex of the gabled section and a door and window opening at first floor level contain a sealed timber paneled and glazed door and a tall, rectangular, timber framed, double-hung window with multi- paned sashes. From Mary Street, a pair of painted, timber paneled doors provides access into a small timber framed and lined entry vestibule which is recessed into and provides access to the building's large foyer space via another pair of timber and glazed paneled swing doors. A tall, arched window with double-hung sashes to the west of the entrance provides natural light to the foyer. The foyer contains a timber staircase to the first floor on the south-eastern wall and south-western wall contains doors to the two rear offices. The rear timber framed addition containing an office, kitchen, bathroom and access to the rear stair is accessed from the former rear door to the building located in the south-eastern office. The first floor level, accessed via a timber staircase, has a similar layout with a small former kitchen and former bedroom at the rear and a larger former living space facing Mary Street. The internal walls on the upper two levels are lined with plaster while ceilings on both levels are lined with double-beaded tongue and groove pine boards with elaborate cornices using plaster to walls and timber to ceilings. The floors on both levels are covered with carpet. Ceiling roses remain in the upper living room (timber) and in the front foyer (plaster). Internal openings are generous in height and consist of timber-paneled doors with glazed pivoting fanlights above. The original rear door leading into the 1930s addition has patterned and obscure glass panels. The former lower level rear window is still in place and is a multi-paned double-hung timber-framed window. Generous cedar skirting boards, skirting blocks and architraves are located in many areas and the majority of the interior timber work and joinery is clear finished. Original window and door furniture generally survives. The internal staircase consists of closed risers and treads with elaborate turned balusters and newel posts. The handrail follows the turn of the stairs and the skirting board is also carefully shaped to follow the incline. The underside of the stair is enclosed with timber paneling. The basement level has an asphalt floor and the perimeter rock, brick and sandstone foundations are visible to the north, east and west walls. Steel posts and a new central beam have recently been added to support the existing bearers spanning the building. Herringbone struts brace the hardwood framing. The 1930s addition is supported on brick piers and its roof is clad with corrugated metal sheeting. A short flight of timber framed stairs provides access to the rear yard and is covered by a timber framed awning. The rear door is timber paneled with a paint finish and adjacent windows are casements with multi-paned coloured glass. A small louvred window is located to the west. Internal walls are lined with double-beaded tongue and groove board and side walls abut immediately to adjoining buildings. This addition is not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  The former Crawford and Co Building was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 July 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Crawford and Co Building erected during the 1880s is important in demonstrating the evolution of Gympie gold mining, a major contributor to the wealth of Queensland for nearly 60 years from 1867. As Gympie gold production continued and evolved from alluvial to shallow reef mining to deep reef mining from 1875, this change was reflected in the erection of more permanent and elaborate buildings in the town centre. Erected during the third stage of Gympie mining, the former Crawford and Co Building is indicative of the wealth and permanence of the town. Its siting near Commissioners Hill in the vicinity of important government and gold-related buildings also illustrates the growth and evolution of Gympie's development. It forms part of the upper Mary Street gold era precinct. For almost four of the six decades during which Gympie gold helped sustain the Queensland economy the former Crawford and Co Building provided office accommodation for mining secretaries and sharebrokers, who played a critical role in the gold industry after capital-intense deep reef mining became the predominant method of extracting gold deposits. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former Crawford and Co Building possesses a facade design that, in its individual elements and their composition, is uncommon and has always been uncommon. The use of skyline decoration ‚Äì emu and kangaroo statues bearing shields, picks and shovels; an ornamental central pediment featuring lion's heads, acanthus leaves and egg; and dart mouldings upon a balustraded parapet ‚Äì plus dissimilar and abundant enrichment to each storey including moulded faces on the keystones of the entrance and ground floor window arches is an idiosyncratic stylist combination. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Crawford and Co Building is a good example of Victorian-era commercial offices. The original 1880s structure comprises a foyer, handsome cedar staircase to the first floor rooms, a ground floor office and a basement. The interior contains fine finishes such as plaster walls, decorative plaster cornices, pine ceilings, and handsome original red cedar joinery including windows, fanlights, architraves, skirtings and substantial doors. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building has aesthetic significance for its architectural qualities expressed in the interior craftsmanship and detailing of the joinery and finishes, and for its streetscape value through its form, scale and design which complement other surviving 19th century buildings in the street. The unique facade of the former Crawford and Co Building evokes astonishment and surprise. It comprises uncommon features and combinations of these features to create unusual compositional qualities. Located on the south-western side of Mary Street, the former Crawford and Co Building forms part of the pleasing upper Mary Street streetscape dating from the Gympie gold-mining era.

It was designed by Harry Moore and Alfred Herbert Foster and built from 1919 to 1921. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2009.  History  Memorial plaque for bandmaster Frederick Thomas Percival, 2015 Gympie Memorial Park was established in 1919‚Äì1921 as the Gympie and Widgee District Fallen Soldiers' Memorial Park, with a landscape design prepared by Brisbane's Parks Superintendent Henry (Harry) Moore and a focal timber bandstand designed by Brisbane City Council's architect Alfred Herbert Foster. The park was opened on 20 April 1921 but the first official function in the park was an address to His Royal Highness Edward, Prince of Wales, during the Prince's visit to Gympie on 3 August 1920. Funded largely by community subscription and built on land donated by the Henderson family, owners of Ferguson & Co.'s Union Sawmills, the memorial park was intended as a lasting tribute to the citizens of the city and its district who had died for their country during the Great War of 1914‚Äì1918 and the Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902. The bandstand erected in the park in 1919‚Äì1920 is also a memorial to a former and much-respected local bandmaster, Mr Frederick Thomas Percival. The park is located in Nash's Gully in central Gympie, on the northern side of the Mary River. A little further up the gully, near the later Gympie Town Hall, James Nash had found alluvial gold in 1867, sparking Queensland's first major gold rush in October that year. The Nashville Goldfield was proclaimed and a township was established on the field to support the miners. By mid-1868 the name of the field had been changed to Gympie, reputedly an Aboriginal word for the stinging trees found in the district. The alluvial gold was worked out within 12 months, but reefs on Caledonian Hill, the Hilton, One Mile, Monkland and Two Mile were being worked from early 1868 and by the mid-1870s the township of Gympie had become the centre of one of the richest goldfields in Queensland. About 50 mining companies were still operating at Gympie in 1909, but by the 1920s output was waning. The town of Gympie acquired city status in 1905 and at the outbreak of war in 1914 was the centre of a well-populated timber-getting, sawmilling, dairying and agricultural district. Although fought in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, the Great War had a profound impact on Australia. In 1914 the nation retained strong ties to the \\"motherland\\" and had no hesitation in entering the war in support of Britain. Over 300,000 Australians from a population of four million volunteered for service overseas, and approximately 60,000 of these died. Almost every community in every Australian state lost young men in this war. No previous or subsequent war has had such an impact on the nation in terms of loss of life. Even before the end of hostilities, memorials were being erected by Australian communities to honour local people who had served and died during this international conflict. These memorials were a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief. To those who erected them, they were as sacred as grave sites. With British policy decreeing that the Empire war dead were to be buried where they fell, war memorials became substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries overseas. Great War memorials took a variety of forms in Australia, including honour boards, stone monuments, tree-line memorial avenues, memorial parks, and utilitarian structures such as gates, halls and clocks. In Queensland the soldier statue was a popular choice of monument, while the obelisk predominated in southern states. On 9 January 1919 a group of prominent citizens met to establish the Gympie and Widgee District Fallen Soldiers' Memorial Fund and to discuss how best to honour the community's war dead. Several alternatives were proposed, including a garden, a park, a scholarship and a stone \\"digger\\" monument. On behalf of his family ‚Äì and as a tribute to his father William Henderson, who was one of the founders of Ferguson & Co.'s Union Sawmills in Gympie in 1868 ‚Äì Mr Arthur Henderson offered as a site for a memorial park, a triangular parcel of land bounded by River Road and Reef and Young streets in Nash's Gully, in the heart of Gympie. This was Machine Area 12, occupied by the Union Sawmills until they moved to Nashville on the outskirts of Gympie in 1917. There were two main difficulties with the site offered by Mr Henderson: there was no direct access from Mary Street (Gympie's principal commercial thoroughfare); and it lay below the flood mark. Gympie had a long history of severe inundation from the Mary River, with flood levels having reached in 1893 and in 1898. The meeting suggested that Brisbane City Council's Parks Superintendent, Mr Harry Moore be asked to advise. A horticulturalist and landscape gardener, Moore had been appointed as Brisbane's first Parks Superintendent in September 1912, a position he held until the early 1940s, and in 1914 had created the much- admired New Farm Park in Brisbane. In annual Mayor reports, Moore was thanked for his work in beautifying the parks and gardens of Brisbane, and his services were lent to Stephens Shire in 1916 to prepare a design for the Yeronga Memorial Park (constructed 1917‚Äì1921). By early February 1919 Moore had visited Gympie and reported on a number of proposed sites for a park or garden. He favoured the former sawmill site if access from Mary Street could be arranged, and if he could be assured that no serious damage from flooding would result. Public debate over the nature of the memorial to be established, and whether to accept the Henderson family's offer, continued in the local press and at public meetings for well over two months. The Gympie Sub-Branch of the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA) supported the sawmill site, if access from Mary Street could be obtained. After the Henderson family made available an additional strip of land between Mary and Reef streets, with a frontage to Mary Street, their offer was accepted at a public meeting held on 26 March 1919. A park in the centre of the city would be a permanent memorial to the district's fallen soldiers; of benefit to the community; and an attraction to visitors. By mid-July 1919 work on clearing and levelling the site had commenced. Over the next months buildings and fences associated with the former sawmill were dismantled and money received from the sale of the timber in these structures was put toward forming and improving the park. Over the following year open concrete drains at either end of the site (along Young Street and near the intersection of Reef Street and River Road) were domed, and a perimeter fence of iron-bark timber and fabric wire was constructed. The Memorial Committee employed local returned servicemen for the ground works whenever possible. Harry Moore's services were also made available to prepare a design for the park, which he had completed by mid-July 1919. Moore had a distinctive style of layout and planting choices. He rarely used straight paths and formal, classical designs, preferring the fluidity of gently curving gravelled pedestrian walkways radiating from a few entrance points. He favoured the use of raised, dry-stone walled rockery beds with dramatic displays of flowering annuals, perennials and shrubs (roses were a particular favourite of his) in bold, massed-planting arrangements. Moore would use rockeries to line walkways, or as distinctive circular or elliptical features in open grassed lawns. For shade trees, he favoured a bold mix of palms, pines and dramatic flowering species such as poinsettias (Euphorbia pulcherrima) and jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia). In laying out the Fallen Soldiers' Memorial Park at Gympie, Moore provided a pedestrian link from Mary Street through to the southern corner of the park and River Road: \\"Mr Moore's idea is to continue the entrance roadway from Mary street right through to River road on the one grade, the entrance from Mary Street to the Park to be flanked by ornamental rockeries ...\\" (Gympie Times and Mary River Mining Gazette 15 July 1919:3). The gravelled access lane off Mary Street formed the official entrance drive to the park, with the Gympie and Widgee War Memorial Gates at the Mary Street end. Vehicles could pass through the Mary Street entrance gates along the lane to Reef Street on official occasions, but at other times access to the laneway was restricted to pedestrian traffic. At the park, Moore laid out a scheme of gently curving gravel walkways leading from perimeter gates toward a central bandstand. There were at least three perimeter gates: in Reef Street opposite the laneway leading from Mary Street; at the corner of Reef Street and River Road; and at the corner of Young Street and River Road. There may have been a fourth gate toward the eastern end of Reef Street. Access through the park to River Road was restricted to pedestrian traffic. A 1922 photograph shows that early park plantings included an avenue of Cabbage Palms (Livistona australis) along the main walkway leading from the Reef Street entrance opposite the laneway off Mary Street, to the bandstand. The walkway leading from the bandstand to the corner of Young Street and River Road appears to be lined with an avenue of possibly Cabbage Palms alternating with pines (Conifer spp.); and the walkway from the gate at the intersection of Reef Street and River Road, which followed the River Road boundary before turning east toward the bandstand, was lined with what appear to be pine trees. Four raised, circular or elliptical garden beds were set out within open grassed areas of the park ‚Äì three along the River Road side and one north of the walkway leading from Reef Street to the bandstand. Unlike the laneway rockeries, they do not appear to have been edged with stone. A few perimeter shade trees had been planted, but much of the area east of the bandstand remained an open grassy space, where seats were set out when band concerts were being performed. In August 1919 Gympie City Council rescinded a 1917 resolution to endow the construction of a bandstand in the city's Queen's Park as a memorial to local band master FT Percival (who died in 1907), and resolved instead to provide a similar endowment for the construction of a bandstand in the Fallen Soldiers' Memorial Park. The stand was built to the same design as that prepared by AH Foster for New Farm Park, but modified to accommodate a second set of steps. Foster, an architect who joined the Brisbane City Council in 1913 as assistant to the City Engineer, was appointed City Architect in 1925 and held this position until his untimely death in 1932. His park works included bandstands at Bowen Park (1914), New Farm Park (1915), Wickham Park (1917) and Newstead Park and kiosks at Moora Park (Sandgate) and at New Farm Park (1915). The park structures he designed provided a focus and elegance that complemented Harry Moore's fluid landscape designs. Together, Moore and Foster created Brisbane's most beautiful and popular parks and gardens of the early twentieth century. HRH Edward, Prince of Wales at the bandstand, 3 August 1920 Foster's design was for a timber- framed bandstand resting on brick piers set on a concrete base. The structure had a pyramid roof clad with fibrous-cement tiles (a very new product in Australia at that time) and was simply but effectively decorative with gablets to each side of the roof (these had shaped timber in-fills); a finial at the roof peak and at the end of each gablet; timber balustrades and valances with fretwork panels around the pavilion sides; and honeycomb brick infill between the piers. The contract was let in September 1919 to Mr TJ Dale of Gympie, who tendered with a price of . Work was completed in time for the Prince of Wales' visit on 3 August 1920, when a civic address was presented to him from the bandstand. Foster also designed a lighting scheme for the park, using 1000 cp (candle power) lights at the Mary Street entrance gates and in the park, and eight lights of 130 cp each in the bandstand. At a later date, an additional set of concrete stairs was added to the east side of the bandstand, and still later (late 1960s or 1970s), the roof was re-clad with terracotta tiles. In 1919 the Queensland Institute of Architects, on behalf of the Gympie and Widgee District Fallen Soldiers' Memorial Fund, held a design competition for memorial gates in Mary Street. George Rae, a young draftsman in the Brisbane office of Lange Powell, won the competition. The gates cost close to and were completed about August 1920. Plaques on the gateposts recorded the names of 167 local men who died during service in the Great War (1914‚Äì1918) and of the two who fell in the Boer War (1899‚Äì1902). The memorial gates and laneway are the subject of a separate entry in the Queensland heritage register (Gympie and Widgee War Memorial Gates). The Gympie and Widgee District Fallen Soldier's Memorial Park was handed over to the Gympie City Council on 9 February 1921 and was opened officially on 20 April 1921 by senator Major- General Sir Thomas William Glasgow, KCB, CMG, DSO, formerly of Gympie, who had led the Australian re-capture of the French town of Villiers-Bretonneux from German troops on the night of 24 April 1918 and turned the war in favour of the allies. The opening coincided with a \\"carnival and continental cafe\\" in the park conducted by the RSSILA to raise funds for improving their hall in nearby Reef Street, and attracted a crowd of over 2,000. The memorial park, bandstand and gates had cost just over and was opened free of debt. The status of the park was formalised when on 2 December 1921 an area of , comprising former Machine Area 12 and adjacent parts of Reef Street and River Road, was proclaimed as a Reserve for Soldiers' Memorial Park, and the Council of the City of Gympie proclaimed as Trustee on 24 December 1921. In the 1920s the Gympie City Council spent a further on the erection of a fernery and public lavatories in the park. Neither of these facilities survives. Gympie Memorial Park in flood, 1931 Concerns about flooding were well-founded as the park was flooded on many occasions including 1927, 1931 and 1954. During World War II (1939‚Äì1945) the Gympie City Council constructed underground air-raid shelters in the memorial park, adjacent to the band rotunda. These shelters had timber walling, like mine shafts, and a timber roof over which about half a metre of soil was laid, and each could accommodate 20 to 30 people. After the war, the shelters were dismantled. In the 1950s the Council constructed a brick nursery and fernery along the Young Street side of the park. This may have incorporated an earlier brick structure on the site. Reef Street became the principal vehicular access to the park. In 1938 an attempt was made to retrieve sections of the former Reef Street road reserve that had been incorporated into the memorial park in 1921, for car parking purposes. The local sub-branch of the RSSILA took an active interest in protecting the site as a memorial and initially viewed any reduction in the area of the park to be a \\"violation\\", but in late 1944 agreed to Council's plan to remove the fence along Reef Street to provide additional car parking, ease traffic congestion along the street, and create \\"an open and more attractive boundary to the park on this side\\" (Gympie Times 5 December 1944). Eventually all the perimeter fencing to the park was removed, although that along Young Street was still in existence . From 2004 a number of small excisions along the boundaries of the park were made for road widening purposes, the area of the park in August 2009 being . Memorial to those who served in the Korean, Malaya, Borneo and Vietnam campaigns, 2015 Other memorials have been placed in the park since its establishment as a World War I memorial. Circa 1939 the sandstone and marble memorial fountain honouring the discoverer of gold at Gympie, James Nash, was relocated from near the Town Hall to the memorial park, close to the intersection of Reef Street and River Road. At this time the drinking fountain function was lost, and the upper section with sandstone urn and finials was removed. On Armistice Day 1988, a memorial stone in the park was dedicated to the citizens of Gympie and Widgee Shire who had served in military campaigns in Korea (August 1950-July 1953); Malaya/Malaysia (June 1948-July 1960), Borneo (February 1964-August 1966) and Vietnam (July 1962-January 1973). In 2013, the Gympie Regional Council proposed the construction of a $22.7 million levee to protect the CBD area (including the Memorial Park) from future flooding. However, the proposal relies on obtaining state and federal funding. The Soldiers' Memorial Park (now generally referred to simply as the Memorial Park) remains a focus for annual Anzac Day (25 April) and Remembrance Day (11 November) events and a popular local pedestrian park, especially during weekday lunch hours.  Description  Gympie Memorial Park is located just south of the central business district along Mary Street, on a low-lying triangle of ground that occupies the whole of the block bounded by Reef Street to the north, Young Street to the south-east and River Road to the south-west. Linked with Mary Street via a walkway that contains the heritage-listed Gympie and Widgee War Memorial Gates, the park is an attractive green space in the heart of town. Consisting of lawns, circular and oval rose garden beds, paved walkways and a wide variety of mature trees, it retains much of its original form and continues to accommodate many of the functions carried out there since its establishment. A 1920 memorial timber bandstand in the centre of the park is the most visually dominant structure on the site. More discreetly placed is a 1950s brick fernery building, built into the steep bank along the Young Street boundary, which appears to contain elements of an earlier brick structure. A number of other memorials have been placed throughout the park, including a large sandstone monument dedicated to James Nash, which occupies a prominent position near the corner of Reef Street and River Road. Recent signage, bench seating, picnic tables, garbage bins and two children's playgrounds are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance. The park retains much of its original layout design, the key elements of which are the bandstand, walkways, garden beds and trees. The bandstand is located close to the centre of the park and orientated to the north-west. From this central feature, walkways branch out to the south, east and north-west, the latter connecting to the Memorial Gates walkway from Mary Street. At least two of these walkways, those branching to the north-west and south, were part of the 1920 design and have avenues of trees on either side. The walkway to the east also may be part of the original design, and is lined with trees. A later walkway crosses the park north to south, linking the Memorial Gates walkway with River Road. All the walkways through the park are paved. Despite their recent concrete and block edging, four garden beds in the park (one elliptical shaped, three circular) appear to be of the same dimensions and in the same positions as the garden beds established in 1920. Three are placed in a line parallel to the River Street boundary in the western half of the park, with circular beds at either end and the elliptical bed in the centre. The fourth and largest circular garden bed sits to the north of the bandstand near the Reef Street boundary. All four beds are planted with roses in 2009. The variety and number of planted mature trees is a distinctive characteristic of the park. These include trees planted around the park perimeter, creating a green screen that varies in density depending on the tree species used. Some, such as several Hoop Pines (Araucaria cunninghamii) appear, by their size, to be very mature and may date from the earliest planting schemes. Apart from Hoop Pines, perimeter plantings consist mainly of Jacarandas (Jacaranda mimosifolia), Brown Pines (Podocarpus elatus), Crows Ash (Flindersia australis) and Kauri Pine (Agathis robusta). Early trees can also be found in the avenues planted along walkways that exist from the original park layout. The avenue linking the bandstand to the Memorial Gates walkway has Queen Palms (Syagrus romanzoffiana), Cabbage Palms (Livistona australis) and Chinese Fan Palms (Livistona chinensis), some of which appear to be evident in early photographs. The avenue running south from the bandstand to the corner of River Road and Young Street contains paired Bumpy Ash (Flindersia schottiana) trees, alternated with various species of palm. Lining the walkway heading east from the bandstand are paired Jacarandas and other trees including a large Weeping Fig (Ficus benjamina). Other individual and grouped specimen trees are found throughout the park. Some notable examples are a large Slash Pine (Pinus elliottii (Pinus caribaea)) west of the bandstand, a line of Silky Oaks (Grevillea robusta) through the eastern lawn area and a mature Illawarra Flame tree (Brachychiton acerifolius) in the north-west corner of the park. Bandstand, 2012 The 1920 bandstand is a free-standing, elevated, timber-framed pavilion. The square, broken-back hipped roof has small gable projections on all four sides and is clad in concrete tiles. Each gablet has a bargeboard and decorative timber screens. The roof is supported by square timber posts that have decorated tops and ornamental brackets. A timber frieze (featuring a harp and a crossed horns motif) sits under the roof, running between each post. The timber board-lined ceiling, consisting of four triangular panels joined with cover strips, falls gently towards the centre of the pavilion. The bandstand plan is essentially square, with fixed timber corner benches and narrow, rectangular bays projecting out from all four sides. A timber balustrade encompasses the whole, in-filled with a combination of timber balusters and some metal replacement sections. The platform floor is timber board-lined and accessed by concrete steps to the north-west and south-east. The steps on the main (north-west) facade are narrower and have a marble memorial plaque attached to the concrete piers on either side. The one on the left states \\"In Memory of F. T. Percival, Bandmaster, 1902‚Äì1907\\" while the other is inscribed \\"In Memory of Fallen Comrades, The Great War, 1914‚Äì1918\\". The structure stands on concrete piers that are connected by panels of honeycombed brickwork. The ground immediately around the bandstand is paved and linked to the three paved walkways that branch out from here. The 1950s fernery building is constructed from orange bricks and consists of an enclosed storage room at the south-east end and a long, open air enclosure used for growing ferns and other plants. The storage shed at the south-west end has a timber framed gable roof, clad in corrugated iron. The walls are brick and appear to encase remnants of an earlier brick-on-edge structure with decorative lintels above the north-west- facing openings, made of bricks standing on end and angled. The fernery enclosure has a skillion roof with steel truss framing, clad primarily with steel caging panels and shade cloth. The fernery walls are solid brickwork up to waist height with brick piers supporting the roof structure. Window openings between the piers are in-filled with steel caging panels. Two doorways open onto the park, one at either end. The north-east end of the fernery has small, flat roofed, block work extension. James Nash Memorial, 2012 Of the other memorials positioned around the park, the sandstone and marble monument to James Nash is the most prominent. It stands in the north- west corner of the park, facing the intersection of Reef Street, River Road and Monkland Street. Designed in a classical style, it has a square base, Corinthian-order pilasters at each corner, a wide cornice, and is topped by a sandstone block ornamented with a carved wreath. Marble panels are fixed between each pilaster; two have projecting marble basins and one is inscribed with the words \\"Erected to the Memory of James Nash, who discovered the Gympie goldfield, 16th October 1867. Born at Beanacre, Wiltshire, England, 5th September 1834. Died at Gympie 5th October 1913.\\" West of the bandstand is a \\"Peace Pole\\" memorial that has one plaque attached to a decorated timber pole and another on a rock at its base. Aligned with the bandstand to the south- west is a 1988 War Memorial, which consists of a large sandstone boulder with a small cross carved in relief, a large granite plaque and a small brass plaque below it. A low, semi-circular concrete masonry wall surrounds the boulder and has two brass plaques on its inner face, commemorating the deaths of individual soldiers. A nearby flagpole associated with this memorial stands to the north-west. The low-lying position of the park and the density of trees planted around its edge focus views within and through the park, rather than out from it. Glimpses of the park in its treed setting can be obtained from a number of surrounding streets to the north and from Calton Hill adjacent to the south-east.  Heritage listing  Gympie Memorial Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 18 September 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Memorial Park was established in 1919‚Äì1921 as a lasting tribute to citizens of Gympie and its district who had died for their country during the Great War of 1914‚Äì1918 and to the two who had fallen during the Boer War of 1899‚Äì1902. As part of a spontaneous outpouring of national grief at the loss of 60,000 Australians during the Great War of 1914‚Äì1918, the Memorial Park contributed to the nation-building of Australia in the early twentieth century and remains important in demonstrating a significant aspect of Queensland's history. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Memorial Park at Gympie remains among the most intact of the early twentieth century collaborative efforts of landscape designer Henry (Harry) Moore and architect AH Foster, in creating popular and much- admired public parks and gardens. As employees of the Brisbane City Council and associated principally with Brisbane, the fact that Moore and Foster were invited to design the park layout and bandstand at Gympie is testament to the popularity and wider influence of their work at this period. The best Brisbane examples of the work of Moore and Foster survive at New Farm Park (1914) and in elements of the 1914 re-design of Bowen Park. Neither remains as true to Moore's design concept as the Memorial Park at Gympie, which retains early design elements including: the connection between the laneway off Mary Street and the Memorial Park; the arrangement of the main walkways radiating from a central focal point occupied by a decorative timber bandstand; the circular and elliptical raised garden beds; and early tree plantings. The substantially intact, timber bandstand designed by AH Foster is an excellent example both of a park bandstand of this era in Queensland, and of Foster's design abilities. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The park possesses beautiful and picturesque attributes, due to: the careful composition and intactness of early elements (such as the bandstand, walkways, garden beds and trees) associated with the original park layout; sightlines and views through the park (with the bandstand as the central focus); the avenues of mature trees containing a variety of species; and the sense of enclosure and calm created by perimeter plantings that screen the park from commercial development surrounding it. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The place has a strong and special association for Gympie and district as the focus for public commemorative events at annual Anzac and Remembrance days.

It is distinguished by its horizontally arranged flowers and unusually short sepals and petals. Description Caladenia discoidea has a single leaf, long, about wide and hairy on both surfaces. The flower stem is long and bears 1 to 4 flowers, each long and wide. The flowers are oriented horizontally, are yellow and green with red stripes, have very short petals and sepals and a rounded, fringed labellum with dark calli. Flowers appear between August and early October. Taxonomy and naming Caladenia discoidea was first described by John Lindley in 1840 in A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony. The specific epithet is \\"from the Latin discoideus (rounded blade and thickened margin), alluding to the rounded labellum shape\\". Distribution and habitat The dancing spider orchid is widespread in the drier areas of the south-west between Kalbarri and Israelite Bay, growing in woodland, sometimes on the edges of salt lakes. It occurs in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Geraldton Sandplains, Jarrah Forest, Mallee and Swan Coastal Plain biogeographic regions of Western Australia.

It is located in The Olema, a historic restaurant and inn built in 1876. The restaurant is at the corner of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and Star Route One in Olema, California. Olema is located in West Marin County from the Bear Valley portal to the Point Reyes National Seashore.  Early days  The road outside the inn had large earthquake-caused fissures in 1906. The building was constructed by the area's original Spanish land grantee, Rafael Garcia, in 1876 as part of a land grant from Mexico. John Nelson, the stage coach company owner that ran a stage from Olema to San Rafael, won the inn from Felix Garcia, Rafael's son, in a game of chance. The Nelsons owned the inn for three generations thereafter. The inn was a popular place of respite for local workers. The name Olema has significant historical heritage originating from the over 125adjacent Miwok Indian villages. In the Miwok language, Olemaloke roughly translates to \\"little coyote\\". During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake the road near the inn was heavily damaged. In 1910 Henry Fielding Reid of the State Earthquake Investigative Commission opined that Olema was the epicenter of the earthquake. This was later disproved, and the epicenter was found to be about 50miles north of San Francisco. The inn survived the earthquake.  Current use  The Olema Ranch barn is adjacent to the inn In 2006 the inn and restaurant went on the market for . In 2010 the Olema Inn was purchased by chefs Daniel DeLong and Margaret Grad√©, repainted from bright white to nearly black, and rechristened as Sir and Star at The Olema. Sir and Star is a portmanteau of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and Star Route One.  Biography of current owners  Until 1999 Chef DeLong worked at Elroy's, Bix, and Stars restaurants in San Francisco. Grad√© was a neuropsychologist at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). At this point the entwined pair purchased Manka's Inverness Lodge in Inverness which was a former 1918 hunting lodge that was converted to a guest lodge with restaurant years prior to their purchase. Alice Waters a pioneer in the California cuisine movement and the founder of Chez Panisse restaurant in Berkeley mentored Grad√© during this time of new beginnings and they remain good friends. Manka's was one of the 50-best hotel restaurants in the U.S. in 2003 according to Food & Wine magazine. The Zagat survey for 2007 ranked it in the top-5 of their top-30. Manka's is known as a quiet hideaway even for celebrities. Prince Charles of England (the Prince of Wales) and his new wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, previously Camilla Parker Bowles, took over the entire main lodge at Manka's during their West Marin tour of local farmers and ranchers learning the ropes of farm-to- table foraging. They were escorted on their tour by Waters and Grad√©. A few months later the main lodge that they stayed in and its attached restaurant burned to the ground during a severe winter windstorm. Grad√© and DeLong live in Inverness and have twins born in 2008.

However, immediately before joining the project Donald McGill had previously worked for the Scottish Education Department and worked on their alternative 'O' grade syllabus, published in 1963; Woolnough, pp. 95-96; and a Scottish teachers' team developed the mechanics section for Nuffield physics; Jardine, pp. 172+. The Scottish Science for the 70s course was a rival to Nuffield Combined Science; Woolnough, p. 56. secondary schools, under the auspices of the Nuffield Foundation. Although not intended as a curriculum, it gave rise to alternative national examinations, and its use of discovery learning was influential in the 1960s and 1970s. Background In 1957, the Science Masters Association (later amalgamated with the Association of Women Science Teachers as The Association for Science Education) established a Science Teaching Subcommittee, later the Science and Education Subcommittee, led by its chairman, Henry Boulind, a physicist who had attended a UNESCO conference the previous year in Hamburg and come away persuaded that science teaching, particularly in physics, needed to be brought up to date for the post-war atomic age and to become teaching \\"in and through science\\". Subject panels in physics, chemistry, biology and general science developed new syllabi for 'O' and 'A' levels which were presented to the Secondary Schools Examination Council in 1960.Brian E. Woolnough, Physics Teaching in Schools, 1960-85: Of People, Policy, and Power, Studies in Curriculum History 8, London/New York: Falmer, 1988, , pp. 87-88. The Staff Inspector for Science, R. A. R. Tricker, criticised the physics syllabus as overly theoreticalJohn L. Lewis, \\"Eric Rogers and the Nuffield Physics Project\\", in Brenda Jennison and Jon Ogborn, eds., Wonder and Delight: Essays in Science Education in honour of the life and work of Eric Rogers 1902-1990, Bristol/Philadelphia: Institute of Physics Publishing, 1994, , pp. 153-62, p. 153: \\"The new syllabus even included some physics since 1895. The latter came under criticism from HM Inspectorate as it suggested dogmatic teaching.\\" and a year's practical trial of the material was conducted in 30 schools. The subcommittee then invited representatives from government and the Institutes of Physics and Chemistry to a meeting in August 1961 at Barrow Court, where the consensus was that outside funding should be sought for a full process to develop curricula and teaching materials.Woolnough, pp. 88-90. The Nuffield Foundation had also been investigating the problem, and sponsored a meeting at Battersea College of Technology hosted by the Head of Physics, Lewis Elton, in April 1961, and also consulted John Lewis, the senior science master at Malvern College, who had been involved at all stages in the Association's Subcommittee and had been impressed by the science teaching he had seen in a tour of Russia.Woolnough, p. 93. The hope was to improve British science teaching, and hence British industry, \\"by persuasion\\" where Russia had done so \\"by compulsion\\".Ronald W. Clark, A Biography of the Nuffield Foundation, London: Longman, 1972, , p. 171.Concern for the competitiveness of British industry was widespread at the time; in 1963 Harold Wilson made a speech urging improvements to education so that Britain would not be disadvantaged in the \\"white heat of the technological revolution\\"; cited in Alan Peacock, \\"The Emergence of Primary Science\\", in Amos and Boohan, eds., Teaching Science, pp. 71-81, p. 71\\\\. This was also an international concern, with science teaching reform in the US acquiring added impetus after Sputnik; Donnelly and Jenkins, p. 28. In December the Nuffield Foundation agreed to fund the effort to improve science education in England and Wales, building on the Science Masters Association's work, but on its own terms, with an initial commitment of ¬£250,000 for three working groups to develop outlines, textbooks, teachers' guides and classroom equipment for the teaching of physics, chemistry and biology to pupils aged 11-15, and the Minister of Education, Sir David Eccles, announced the plan in the House of Commons on 4 April 1962.Clark, pp. 170-71.Woolnough, pp. 94-95.Mary Waring, Social Pressures and Curriculum Innovation: A Study of the Nuffield Foundation Science Teaching Project, London: Methuen, 1979, , pp. 2-3, 82-85.James F. Donnelly and Edgar W. Jenkins, \\"Guiding Teachers: The Nuffield Science Teaching Projects\\", in Science Education: Policy, Professionalism and Change, London: Paul Chapman / Thousand Oaks, California: Sage, 2001, , pp. 27-41, p. 27. History and characteristics For each of the three sciences, a working group was established headed by a full-time organiser, appointed for three years, and including a consultative committee of experts and six or seven team leaders, expert teachers on one-year appointments who headed local groups of half a dozen science teachers which would develop and test materials. The physics project was organised first, under Donald McGill; the chemistry project was under H. F. Halliwell, and the biology project under W. H. Dowdeswell. The initial focus on the course to 'O' level was extended to 'A' level and a Junior Science Project on primary school teaching was added by 1966;Clark, pp. 171-73.Waring, pp. 86-87, 94. later in the 1960s Nuffield also began a Combined Science Project, a Secondary Science Project for pupils who would not take 'O' levels, the Nuffield Language Teaching Programme in modern languages, and programmes in mathematics, classics, and social studies.Clark, p. 173.Donnelly and Jenkins, p. 29. McGill died in March 1963 and was succeeded at the physics project by Eric M. Rogers.Woolnough, pp. 96-98.Lewis, pp. 156-57. John Maddox was added as an assistant director of the foundation and coordinator of the project as a whole. In 1966 the development phase came to an end and teachers' guides, pupils' question books and other material were published in time for the school year starting in autumn 1967.Waring, p. 193. Nuffield sponsored Area Committees, training of tutors to train teachers, television programmes on teaching Nuffield science, and two films showing actual chemistry classrooms: Exploring Chemistry and Chemistry by Investigation.Waring, pp. 195-203. The Local Education Authority teachers' centres and specialist centres at teacher training institutions also provided training in Nuffield methods;Waring, p. 202. the project itself established the Centre for Science Education at Chelsea College, which was able to grant degrees.Rob Walker, \\"Getting Involved in Curriculum Research: A Personal History\\", in Martin Lawn and Len Barton, eds., Rethinking Curriculum Studies: A Radical Approach, 1981, 2nd ed. Routledge Library Editions: Education 20, London / New York: Routledge, 2012, , pp. 193-213, p. 193. Organisers were charged simply with creating \\"a coordinated set of materials, for use by teachers in any way they saw fit.\\"Waring, p. 13. The foundation also gave instructions to avoid public announcements or debates for two years.Lewis, p. 156. The approach taken in all three sciences was inquiry-based:Donnelly and Jenkins, p. 28.Waring, pp. 131-32, with reference to chemistry. teaching \\"for understanding, not learning\\" in a manner that was both logical and based on experiments, with pupils \\"learning through doing\\",Woolnough, pp. 103-04, with reference to physics. being 'a scientist for a day' and deriving scientific laws through 'guided discovery' rather than 'prov[ing] theory'. The project used an apocryphal Chinese proverb, \\"I listen and I forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand\\" as a motto.Sandra Amos and Richard Boohan, \\"The Changing Nature of Science Education\\", in Sandra Amos and Richard Boohan, eds., Teaching Science in Secondary Schools: A Reader, The Open University, London / New York: RoutledgeFalmer, 2002, , pp. 3-21, p. 7.Jerry Wellington, \\"Practical Work in Science: Time for a Re-Appraisal\\", in Amos and Boohan, eds., Teaching Science, pp. 55-66, p. 56. Halliwell, the chemistry project organiser, has said that he was greatly influenced by Sir Percy Nunn, under whom he studied in the 1920s;Waring, p. 38. another important influence was work in the United States, particularly the Physical Science Study Committee's reformed physics course, with which Rogers had been involved at Princeton University.Woolnough, pp. 97-98. The teachers' guides outlining the class activities were explicitly described as \\"not a syllabus\\", but many teachers used them as a \\"bible\\".Woolnough, pp. 105, 107.According to research by R. B. Ingle in the early 1970s with a view to revising the chemistry materials, many chemistry teachers did not have time to read the handbook and simply used the Sample Scheme, an example of how to construct a course; Waring, p. 214. Particularly for physics, kits of apparatus for class experiments were developed in association with manufacturers; government money was readily available at the start of the project for schools to purchase equipment and improve their laboratories.Woolnough, pp. 165-67.Jim Jardine, \\"Apparatus for the Inquiring Mind\\", in Jennison and Ogborn, eds., Wonder and Delight, pp. 169-80, on development and testing of physics apparatus under Eric Rogers. Distinct Nuffield 'O' and 'A' level examinations were instituted, although they were originally intended only as a temporary measure.Woolnough, p. 58. Reception Nuffield biology was not very popular.Woolnough, p. 45. In chemistry and physics, the Nuffield discovery approach was dominant by the 1970s and had a lasting influence,Woolnough, pp. 54-55, 78.Amos and Boohan, p. 8.Donnelly and Jenkins, p. 37.Douglas P. Newton and Richard Gott, \\"Process in Lower School Science Textbooks\\", British Educational Research Journal 15.3 (1989) 249-58, p. 258. although more teachers used the materials than taught Nuffield science as the project developers had intended.Woolnough, pp. 58-59, citing a 1976 study.Another study in the same period analysed differences in familiarity and attitudes between \\"high adopters\\" and \\"low adopters\\" of Nuffield chemistry; the percentage of \\"low adopters\\" 'using all or most' of the materials at the relevant level was in the 20s; Donnelly and Jenkins, p. 33. At their peak of popularity, the Nuffield 'O' and 'A' level examinations were still only taken by far fewer candidates than the traditional GCEs.Donnelly and Jenkins, p. 34. The project was developed primarily by academics and teachers in private and selective schools, in the context of the early objective of having comprehensive schools provide a \\"grammar school education for all\\",Woolnough, pp. 33-36.David Turner, \\"Reform and the Physics Curriculum in Britain and the United States\\", Comparative Education Review 28.3 (August 1984) 444-53, notes that the Physical Science Study Committee's reformed physics course in the United States had a similar focus on the most able students. and the first two years of Nuffield physics and chemistry were found to be difficult even for able pupils.Woolnough, p. 55.Joan Bliss, \\"Learning Science: Piaget and After\\", in Amos and Boohan, eds., Teaching Science, pp. 154-63, p. 155, citing a 1971 study.Anthony W. Pell, \\"Enjoyment and Attainment in Secondary School Physics\\", British Educational Research Journal 11.2 (1985) 123-32, p. 123. As a result, the Nuffield Combined Science course, derived from the three distinct science courses, was introduced in 1970 for pupils in the first two years of mixed-ability secondary schools; in 1980, 80% of schools were using this in some way. Its use of worksheets was emulated in other courses in the mid-1970s, such as the Inner London Education Authority's Insight to Science.Woolnough, pp. 55-56. In 1971 Nuffield Secondary Science was added; this was material from which teachers could develop a course for the Mode 3 CSE examination.Woolnough, p. 59. Some teachers suggested that the practical work itself discouraged pupils from continuing with chemistry and physics after 'O' level.Ian Abrahams, Practical Work in Secondary Science: A Minds-On Approach, London / New York: Continuum, 2011, , pp. 25-26. By the 1980s, with a greater emphasis on educating pupils of all abilities and the introduction of a national curriculum and replacement of the existing examinations by the GCSE, emphasis shifted from teaching theory to making science interesting and relevant and rewarding achievement.Woolnough, pp. 176-78. A revised version of Nuffield Combined Science, Nuffield 11 to 13, was published in 1986 reflecting this change in focus.Woolnough, p. 60.Justin Dillon and Alex Manning, \\"Science Teachers, Science Teaching: Issues and Challenges\\", in Good Practice in Science Teaching: What Research Has to Say, ed. Jonathan Osborne and Justin Dillon, 2nd ed. Maidenhead / New York: McGraw Hill / The Open University, 2010, , pp. 6-19, pp. 10-11. Some early research suggested in particular that Nuffield science was less suitable for girls than boys.Mary Lewin, \\"Is Science too Masculine?\\", Feedback, New Scientist, 27 March 1975, p. 778.Alison Kelly, Girls and Science: An International Study of Sex Differences in School Science Achievement, IEA Monograph Studies 9, Stockholm: Almqvist & Wiksell, 1978, , pp. 14-15. This may be because girls reportedly dislike discovery teaching, but there are indications that teacher enthusiasm is more important, and a study in 1981 found no significant differences between girls' and boys' performance on Nuffield 'O' levels, possibly because few teachers actually use \\"open-ended\\" methods.Alison Kelly, \\"Conclusion: Retrieving the Missing Half\\", in The Missing Half: Girls and Science Education, ed. Alison Kelly, Manchester: Manchester University, 1981, , pp. 276-97, p. 279, citing Judy Samuel, \\"Feminism and Science Teaching: Some Classroom Observations\\", The Missing Half, pp. 247-56, and Jan Harding, \\"Sex Differences in Science Examinations\\", The Missing Half, pp. 192-204. The fundamental criticism of the discovery approach as a whole is that it inaccurately presents science as \\"Sherlock Holmes in a white coat\\", with observation leading directly by induction to theory. A 1996 survey termed it \\"philosophically unsound and pedagogically unworkable\\";Wellington, p. 56, citing D. Hodson, \\"Laboratory Work as Scientific Method: Three Decades of Confusion and Distortion\\", Journal of Curriculum Studies 28.2, 115-35\\\\. The Sherlock Holmes descriptor is Wellington's own from an earlier paper. children cannot realistically reproduce the progression of scientific discovery. Another expert judged Nuffield to have incorporated some particularly \\"naive\\" versions of inductivism.Rosalind Driver, \\"The Fallacy of Induction in Science Teaching\\", in Amos and Boohan, eds., Teaching Science, pp. 133-39, p. 135.

It was formed in 1946 from the 3rd Battalion of the 185th Infantry of the California National Guard. The regiment was part of the 40th Infantry Division during wartime and a unit of the California National Guard during peacetime. The regiment was called into federal service and fought in the Korean War. It was returned to state control on 30 June 1954 and was broken up the following day.  Origins  The regiment can trace its history back to the 7th Infantry Regiment (California). In 1917, the 7th Infantry Regiment (California) consolidated with elements of the 2nd Infantry Regiment (California) to form the 160th Infantry Regiment. On 1 April 1929, the 2nd Battalion of the 160th was reorganized to form the 2nd Battalion of the 185th Infantry Regiment. In March and April 1930, the 2nd Battalion of the 185th expanded to become the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 185th. During World War II, the 185th fought in the New Britain campaign and in the Philippines Campaign. Postwar, it was decided the California could support a second National Guard division, the 49th Infantry Division, composed of the 159th, 184th and 185th Infantry Regiments. The 40th Infantry Division was composed of the 160th, 223rd and 224th Infantry Regiments. The 223rd Infantry was formed from the 2nd Battalion of the 185th Infantry Regiment. The 224th Infantry Regiment was formed on 15 October 1946 in Ontario, California from the 185th Infantry Regiment's 3rd Battalion.  Korean War  On 1 September 1950, the 40th Infantry Division became part of the active army from the National Guard. After training, the division was transported to Japan in March 1951. It was part of XVI Corps at Camp Schemmelfenning. On 7 January 1952, the division relieved the 24th Infantry Division and was transferred to Korea. The regiment was commanded by Colonel James L. Richardson, nicknamed Walking Jim. Landing at Incheon on 3 February, the 224th relieved the 5th Regimental Combat Team on 10 February in the IX Corps sector. Company L of the 3rd Battalion regiment conducted a limited predawn raid against Chinese-held bunkers and entrenchments along a ridge known as The Boot on 18 February. Supported by 22 tanks from the regimental tank company, the heavy weapons company of the 3rd Battalion (Company M), and three Quad 50s from the 140th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, the company attacked with two platoons in the lead and a third in reserve. Richardson, with his radio operator, personally accompanied one of the lead platoons. While the tanks suppressed the Chinese bunkers, the infantry moved forward under mortar and artillery bombardment, which was countered by the 40th Division artillery. A platoon commander was killed by mortar fragments, while Richardson's radio operator was mortally wounded on the ridge. Richardson, who was slightly wounded, carried his radio operator down to a tank at the bottom of the ridge for evacuation, after deciding to disengage. The company withdrew under mortar fire, having lost four killed, two missing, and thirty wounded, while claiming enemy casualties of 27 confirmed killed, 46 estimated killed, and 65 estimated wounded. The 224th's tank company destroyed ten enemy bunkers in an action at the end of February. After the division relieved the 2nd ROK Infantry Division during between 21 March and 30 March, the regiment was placed in reserve. On 3 April, the regiment was deployed onto the frontline due to a boundary change with the 2nd Infantry Division. The division was responsible for defending the Kumwha- Kaesong sector. On 30 June, the division was relieved by the 2nd ROK Infantry Division and was transferred to the rear. The 224th Infantry was moved to Pusan under the 2nd Logistical Command on 5 July to guard prisoners of war in the area. On 23 September, the regiment rejoined the division in the Kapyong area. On 22 October, the 224th relieved the 25th Infantry Division's 27th Infantry Regiment in the Paemihyonni sector, where it defended the frontline from enemy attacks. On 2 September 1952, a replacement 224th Infantry Regiment was formed as a National Guard unit in Ontario. That regiment was disbanded when the original 224th returned to California on 30 June 1954. The 224th was replaced in the line by the 45th Infantry Division's 180th Infantry Regiment on 28 January 1953 and moved to Imje in the X Corps rear. On 17 March, the 224th was attached to the 45th Infantry Division's reserve and moved up to Wondang-ni. The regiment relieved elements of the 20th ROK Division on 27 April and was transferred back to the 40th Infantry Division, defending the division's left flank on the Punchbowl. On 11 July, the division replaced the 45th Infantry Division and the 224th was deployed at the Sandbag Castle area. After the armistice, the division withdrew to the DMZ line. With casualties of 376 killed and 1,457 wounded, the 40th Infantry Division's casualties were the lowest of any American division during the Korean War. The 224th Regiment itself had casualties of 98 killed.  Postwar  The 224th returned with the division to California and reverted to state control on 30 June 1954. The following day, the regiment was broken up and its 1st Battalion became the 224th Armored Infantry Battalion while the 3rd Battalion was converted to the 161st Armored Infantry Battalion. On 1 July 1959, the 224th Armored Infantry Battalion consolidated with the 160th and 223rd Armored Infantry Battalions to form the 160th Infantry Regiment. The 160th Infantry Regiment was a parent unit under the Combat Arms Regimental System, part of the 40th Armored Division. The newly formed regiment consisted of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th Rifle Battalions.

Biography Ko was born in 1952, on Jeju Island, and graduated from Hongik University. He lives and works in Seoul. His work is known for its hyperrealism that invokes trompe l'oeil. Art By representing objects with their most minute details, Ko, in the line of Magritte, questions our beliefs in authenticity and objectivity. But if his work clearly draws on Western influences, it is also the product of an almost mystical reflexion on traditional Korean aesthetic values and on the concepts of nothingness (mu ÁÑ°) and existence (yu Êúâ). His work can be considered pertaining to both Hyperrealism and Surrealism. The critic G√©rard Xuriguera says of his series Stonebook: \\"Combining in his painting lettered messages and their relation to stones, he positions them within the pages of an open book or imposed on newspapers, strangely gravity-free, in a way that creates contrasts in tension, modifying the sense of the displaced objects. This creates a sort of wakened dream, never broken from natural ebbs, in which reality and illusion combine.\\" Selected art exhibitions * Ko has had solo exhibitions in Seoul at Total Art Museum and Gana Art Center; * In 1986, he exhibited in the 42nd Venice Biennale. * Ko's work in featured in a variety of prominent public collections, including the National Museum of Contemporary Art and the Ho-Am Art Museum, both in Korea; * the Detroit Institute of Arts; Mus√©e de Luneville, France; the Queen Beatrix Collection, in Amsterdam, and the Yokohama Business Park in Japan. * Three of his works were recently displayed in the Paris group show exhibition \\"Vide et Plein\\", displaying the work of 10 Asian artists, organized by Paris-based Maison Bleu Studio.

The time period covered extends from the Battle of Actium in 31 BC to the reign of Diocletian. The final volume of the second edition, PIR2, vol. IX, V‚ÄìZ, appeared in November 2015.  History  The first edition was rapidly achieved and published in Berlin in the line of the great works of scholarship from the historical school of economics which had been successful in achieving the project of a corpus of all the Latin inscriptions, the Corpus inscriptionum latinarum. Led by Elimar Klebs, Hermann Dessau and Paul von Rohden,Jean Maurin, La prosopographie romaine : pertes et profits, Annales. √âconomies, Soci√©t√©s, Civilisations, 37th year, N. 5-6, 1982. pp. 824-836., , p. 835 note 23 the first edition of the PIR was edited in three volumes from 1897 to 1898. The implementation of a second edition was last updated in 1933 for publication in Berlin. The first booklet of the second edition was led by Edmund Groag and Arthur Stein who brought together the letters A and B. The publication was interrupted by World War II while working on the letter F (1943). From 1952 they took the direction of Stein and then Leiva Petersen. After German unification the project found a new dynamic. It was from then on led by K. Wachtel. The fascicle concerning the letter S was then published in 2006, and T in 2009. The index of names and people integral to the PIR was in the meantime made searchable on the website of the PIR.PIR website (German) Volume 2 of the PIR includes notes for all the well-known Roman senators, the nobles, and some civil servants not of equestrian rank, such as manumitted imperial freedmen who are attested in the literary tradition. Entries in the PIR are indexed by the initial letter of the name, then by the number of the entry, i.e. Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus corresponds to the entry PIR2 C 973: the 973rd entry under the letter C. For periods after the third century which the PIR does not cover, there is Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire by A.H.M. Jones, J.R. Martindale, and John Morris.

He was not selected in the 2006 NFL Draft; as such, he signed with the San Jose SaberCats of the Arena Football League in November 2006. Littlejohn saw little action as a rookie; despite this, he won his first championship when the SaberCats defeated the Columbus Destroyers in ArenaBowl XXI.

The term refers to the military forces of the Sukhothai Kingdom, the Ayutthaya Kingdom, the Thonburi Kingdom and the Early Rattanakosin Kingdom in chronological order. The army was one of the major military forces of Southeast Asia. With a reform into a new Western- style army in 1852, the Royal Siamese Army became a new European-trained military force. The Royal Thai Armed Forces are the contemporary military of Thailand. King Naresuan army with war elephants entered an abandoned Bago, Burma in1600 Organization The Royal Siamese Army was organized into three general tiers: the Palace Guards, the Capital Defense Corps, and the field levies. Only the first two were the standing military. They protected the sovereign and the capital region, and formed the nucleus of the armed forces in wartime. The third, the field levies or conscripts, were usually raised just prior to or during wartime, and provided manpower to resist attacks and project power beyond the boundaries of the empire. Most of the field levy served in the infantry but the men for the elephantry, cavalry, artillery and naval corps were drawn from specific hereditary villages that specialized in respective military skills. =Special branches= The infantry was the backbone of the wartime Siamese army, and was supported by special branches‚Äîthe elephantry, cavalry, artillery, and naval corps. These special branches were formed by the men from certain hereditary villages that provided the men with specialized skills. In a typical Ayutthaya or Rattanakosin formation, a 1000-strong infantry regiment was supported by 100 horses and 10 war elephants. Elephantry The main use of war elephants was to charge the enemy, trampling them and breaking their ranks. Although the elephantry units made up only about one percent of the overall strength, they were a major component of Siamese war strategy throughout the imperial era. The army on the march would bring expert catchers of wild elephants. Image:War elephant in national museum Bangkok.jpgWar elephant and traditional Thai weapons in Bangkok National Museum.

Cavalry From the 17th century onward, cavalry troops made up about 10% of a typical regiment. The men of the cavalry were drawn mainly from hereditary villages.

Artillery During the 16th century, the Siamese artillery and musketeer corps were originally made up exclusively of foreign (European and Muslim) mercenaries. Navy The naval arm of the army consisted mainly of river-faring war boats. Its primary missions were to control the Chao Phraya River, and to protect the ships carrying the army to the front. The major war boats carried up to 30 musketeers and were armed with 6- or 12-pounder cannon. By the mid-18th century, the navy had acquired a few seafaring ships, manned by European and foreign sailors. Image:Naresuan life - Wat Suwan Dararam - Section 02 (2116 BE).jpgA Ayutthaya era war boat Military history of Thai armed forces Reform In 1852, the Royal Siamese Armed Forces came into existence as permanent force at the behest of King Mongkut, who needed a European trained military force to thwart any western threat and any attempts at colonialisation. By 1887, during the next reign of King Chulalongkorn, a permanent military command in the Kalahom Department was established.

Aipov was posthumously awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for actions during the Battle of Berlin, where he reportedly killed 26 German soldiers. Aipov died of his wounds after being seriously wounded in the battle.  Early life  Aipov was born on 12 July 1920 to a peasant family in the village of Kiryushkino in the Khvalynsky Uyezd of Saratov Governorate in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. His family moved to Kostychi village when he was still a child. Aipov received primary education and worked as a mechanic on the Kuybyshev Railway depot at Oktyabrsk.

It developed from urban art in the 1960s, as an alternative to the widely spread use of spray cans in the urban art scene. Tape can be used to produce a \\"stained glass\\" effect when applied to glass or plastic which is lit from behind. It can be attached to a wall to form the outline or an image, or can be shaped into three-dimensional sculptures. Tape artists such as Max Zorn show their work at art fairs including Art Basel Miami.  Characteristics  Tape art can be installed quickly and almost silently, making it suitable for small or temporary urban art projects. No masking or covering is necessary. Tape is relatively easy to handle, and can be applied to various surfaces, such as stone, asphalt, wood, aluminum, sandwich panels or glass. Interior installations work just as well as exterior ones. Unlike spray paint art, tape art can be removed easily without leaving a permanent mark. Materials for tape art vary depending on which tape is being used. Tape art can use duct tape, packing tape, masking tape or other products. Unlike traditional paintings and sculptures, tape art can be applied anywhere, including the doors, ceilings and floors of galleries. Duct tape can be used to construct three-dimensional sculptures.

Announced on June 16, 2015, the UE Roll replaces Ultimate Ears's UE MINI BOOM as the company's lower-end model.  Design and features  The speaker is of a discus-like shape, in diameter, maximum thickness, and weighing . It is coated in a water-, dirt-, and stain- proof material and partly covered with rubber. Ultimate Ear's claims that the speaker is IPX7-rated waterproof, meaning that it can be fully submerged in water up to depth for up to 30 minutes. The speaker comes in several colour schemes, and includes a \\"snap & go\\" bungee cord loop attached to the back of the device, which can be detached on one end. It is suggested that this allows the speaker to be hung up, or attached to, fixtures, as well as clothing, shower heads, bicycles, or even a person's hand. UE ROLL consists of a driver coupled with two tweeters which are in stereo, so there is a small amount of stereo separation. In terms of sound output, it supports a maximum of 85 dBA in a range of 108 Hz‚Äì20 kHz. In addition to supporting Bluetooth, the speaker can be connected via a standard 3.5mm audio input.

A rechargeable lithium-ion battery is built into the UE ROLL, providing up to 9 hours of playback. Charging is done using a provided micro-usb to usb cable, and is estimated to take 5.5 hours for a full charge.

He is primarily known for the Jefferson‚ÄìHemings controversy, as he was rumored to have fathered children by Sally Hemings. Personal life Carr was born in Goochland County, Virginia on January 2, 1770 to Dabney and Martha Jefferson Carr, sister to Thomas Jefferson. Carr was educated in Orange and Williamsburg, and later attended the College of William and Mary. He briefly practiced as a lawyer. Carr married Esther \\"Hetty\\" Smith Stevenson on June 6, 1797 and the two had eight children together. Carr died in his home at Carrsbrook on February 17, 1815. Career =Politics= Carr supported the Republican Party and in 1799, unsuccessfully ran for the Virginia House of Delegates. A later attempt in 1801 proved to be more successful and he was elected for four terms, from 1801 to 1804, and later from 1807 to 1808. An attempt to run for another term was met with failure, as was his attempt to run for Virginia State Senate. Carr triggered the final breach between his uncle and George Washington by writing the latter a seemingly sympathetic letter on September 27, 1797 Dumas Malone, Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1962, p. 309n. under the pseudonym \\"John Langhorne.\\" Dumas Malone, Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1962, pp. 308-11. Washington was suspicious of the letter's purpose, suspicions that were finalized when John Nicholas, the Federalist clerk of Albemarle County, Virginia, Jefferson's home county, informed Washington that \\"Langhorne\\" was leagued with Republican interests, was attempting to bait Washington into revealing High Federalist principles, and was actually Carr. Dumas Malone, Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1962, p. 309. Carr's exact purpose in writing the letter is unknown. Dumas Malone, Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty, Boston: Little, Brown and Company, 1962, pp. 310-11, 311n. =Education= Carr was a supporter of education and in 1811, he opened up a short-lived academy on his estate Carrsbrook. In the early 1800s he was involved with the founding of the Albermarle Academy, an institution that evolved into the Central College and proved influential with the founding of the University of Virginia. Jefferson‚ÄìHemings controversy In 1802 journalist James Thomson Callender claimed that Thomas Jefferson had fathered children with one of his slaves, Sally Hemings. These claims were given credence due to several factors such as Jefferson's presence at Monticello during the time periods that the children were conceived and the lack of pregnancies when he was not present. Theories that Carr and his brother Samuel could have fathered the children surfaced in the mid 1800s due to secondhand accounts where Thomas Jefferson Randolph claimed that Peter and Samuel Carr were responsible. These claims are still given credence by some scholars, even though DNA tests in 1998 ruled that the Carrs could not have fathered one of Hemings's children, Eston.

The story is divided into three main plot threads told from major and minor character POVs. The first tells the story of the Tiste race as they struggle to find their place in a society now divided into three factions ‚Äî Andii, Liosan and Deniers ‚Äî and which is on the brink of civil war. The second tells the story of the Jaghut who have now declared war against Death itself, and of various groups and races who have answered this call to arms. And the last tells the story of the Azathanai K'rul who has gifted the world sorcery, yet now finds himself vulnerable against his own kin. The novel was published on in the United Kingdom by Bantam Books, and on in the United States by Tom Doherty Associates, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers. Although Erikson found it harder to finish the novel compared to his previous works, Fall of Light won high praise from critics and fellow authors, some even hailing it as one of Erikson's best works to date. Several critics have praised the themes of love, empathy and compassion, and the Shakespearean tone and style of the novel. Others have praised it for its timely social commentary, with one critic noting how on a deeper level it conveys the terror and awfulness of war, and how it can affect every individual, young or old. Plot With the absence of Anomander Rake it falls to his brother, Silchas Ruin, to prepare for the inevitable confrontation against Urusander's Legion. He orders the Hust Legion, controversially, to bolster its ranks, after their massive loss from the poisoning at the hands of Hunn Raal, by recruiting prisoners from the mining pits. He also sends Prazek Goul and Dathenar, sergeants in his brother's Houseblades, to serve as lieutenants in the Hust Legion, a decision some among the Houseblade find hard to swallow. The historian, Rise Herat, and the High Priestess of Dark, Emral Lanear, make plans to depose of Draconus by turning the Sons of Darkness against him. Their plan includes corresponding with Syntara, the High Priestess of Light. The Azathanai, Grizzin Farl, also called the Protector, remains at Kharkanas for purposes unknown to anyone but newly befriended Silchas Ruin, to whom he reveals that by his presence alone he keeps away the wolves that are his kin who would look at the Tiste civil war as an opportunity to sink their teeth into something delicious. Remaining within the Chamber of Night, Mother Dark tests her powers through Endest Silann, gifting him the sorcery of Eternal Night. Sharenas Ankhadu confronts Vatha Urusander with the results of her investigations regarding the pogrom of the Deniers. She reveals to him all that she had uncovered and had been witness to regarding Hunn Raal. It becomes more than apparent that Urusander is losing his grip on the Legion, and that Hunn Raal and some few others are part of a conspiracy in which they would stand against the commander if confronted. In lieu of all this, Sharenas takes it upon herself to cull Urusander's camp. The blessing of Light has gifted Hunn Raal with sorcery, and he now fashions the new title of Mortal Sword for himself. His careless display of said power attracts the attention of the Azathanai Olar Ethil, the Goddess of flames, awakener of heat; lust, desire, bloodlust. She cautions him in her contempt to temper and restrain his power, for there were forces more than capable of crushing him beneath their feet. For all but altruistic reasons, she also instructs him to find a master smithy and to build her a fire so that she could guide them to the First Forge where he would be able to forge the Sceptre of Light, as Draconus had forged the Sceptre of Night, thereby bringing a much needed balance between the apposing forces. Hundreds and thousands flock to Omtose Phellack, the home of the Jaghut civilization, to give answer to the impossible war that Hood has declared against Death. Anomander Rake, accompanied by Caladan Brood, wanders the Burned Forrest in search for his brother Andarist, while Draconus, the Suzerain of Night, forges a sword that would defy Chaos.

Major themes As with Malazan Book of the Fallen, the major themes of the novel are love, compassion and empathy. Bill Capossere of Tor.com noted that the core of the story deals with the \\"heart\\"; the one power that stands all too often unremarked, unwitnessed, unworshipped. Style Regarding the style, a critic noted that much like Forge of Darkness, Fall of Light is written in Shakespearean style and tone, although there are more elements of comic relief and respites from the darkness in this one compared to the first. Another critic noted that the novel boils down to the big Erikson \\"event\\" moments paired off and contrasted against very deep personal moments. Much like in Forge of Darkness, the focus falls more squarely on the personal, and through these individuals, Erikson gives a bigger picture of the massive convergences happening, which amounts to a far more Shakespearean tone, with comedy, love, and tragedy all thrown together. He further noted how scenes early on in the novel foreshadow and set the tone for the rest of the narrative. Background On February 28, 2012, Erikson confirmed in a reddit AMA session that the second novel in the Kharkanas Trilogy would be titled Fall of Light, and that it would be published a few years after Forge of Darkness. In a subsequent reddit AMA session held in 2014, Erikson revealed that he had spent an inordinate amount of time working on the second novel (in the Kharkanas trilogy), more than he'd done in any of his previous ones. Tackling his ten volume series, the Malazan Book of the Fallen, he had neatly evaded the dreaded second book syndrome that plagues trilogies, so he was thoroughly unprepared for Fall of Light taking so much out of him. He further revealed that he'd never had issues structuring his stories, until then, and that as a result he had become more and more uncertain regarding the matter. But, he concluded, he'd finally gotten the hang of it and was more confident of its completion than he was before. The novel would ultimately be published in 2016. Publication history =Hardcover= The novel was first released by Bantam in the United Kingdom and Canada as a Hardcover edition on . And subsequently on in the United States by Tom Doherty Associates, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers. =Audiobook= An unabridged audiobook was released by Random House Audiobooks on , which coincided with the UK Hardcover release. It is narrated by Barnaby Edwards. Reception Fall of Light received widespread critical acclaim, with fellow fantasy writer, Glen Cook, famed for his The Black Company series, lauding it as being a masterwork of the imagination that may be the high-water mark of the epic fantasy genre. Writer and critic, Bill Capossere of Tor.com wrote in his very positive review, that while it certainly takes some time for the story to pick its pace, the wait is worth it. He stated that the book was filled with wonderfully thoughtful, intense, and important examinations of the world we live in. Dan Ruffolo of Strange Currencies, wrote that Fall of Light continued a fascinating glimpse into the history of the amazing setting of the world that was introduced in the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, and that Erikson continues his top-notch writing of both scene and dialogue. He concluded that Erikson's ability to handle even very serious scenes with exactly the right type of humour and wit made Fall of Light a pleasure to read. The reviewer at the Critical Dragon stated that the novel builds on the ground established in Forge of Darkness, adding further depth and complexity to the world, while fleshing out the conflict and characters, which bodes extremely well for the third book, Walk in Shadow. He concluded by saying Fall of Light tells a riveting story of complex and powerful characters, with an amazing world to act as a backdrop, and key themes and concepts that give the story force and weight. Steven Diamond of Elitist Book Reviews praised the novel, the characters and the political intrigue, but criticized Erikson's tendency to over philosophize. He noted that although it lends a more self-evaluative and introspective tone to the novel there were moments where he wished it would have pulled back just a bit. He also noted that Fall of Light likely wouldn‚Äôt sway a ton of readers, and concluded that if you liked Erikson to begin with, you'd like the book, but if you didn't then this wouldn't change your mind.

A church on this site has been in use since 1632 when early English settlers built the first meetinghouse. Since then, the meetinghouse has been rebuilt four times, and its appearance today reflects how the meetinghouse looked in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. History =The First Meeting House (1632‚Äì1674)= The First Church of Roxbury was the sixth church to be gathered by the early English settlers. In 1631, settlers living in Roxbury, who belonged to the Church of Dorchester, were finally self-sufficient enough to create their own church‚Äîthe First Church of Roxbury. The \\"official\\" beginning of the church is recognized as when the first meeting house was constructed the next year. The first meetinghouse served as a central part of the community from 1632‚Äì1674. The first pastor, Reverend Thomas Weld, was ordained in July 1632 (and it is presumed that that is also when the Church's covenant, a document stated the congregation was officially recognized by the church, was signed). There is no definitive record of what the first meeting house looked like, but based on the construction of the time, it was likely a simple, small building with a thatched roof. The first meeting house served as a central location for the budding community in Roxbury, as the church was a central part of the early settlers lives (many of whom were fleeing to America for freedom from religious persecution). In August, 1645, the congregation decided to create the \\"Free Schoole in Roxburie\\" (now Roxbury Latin School). Samuel Danforth, the second pastor of the church, was ordained September 24, 1650. John Eliot John Eliot was ordained as the first teacher on November 5, 1632. Eliot, as a Puritan missionary became known by many as \\"the apostle to the Indians\\" for learning the Algonquin language (the Native American language spoken in the area at the time). He used this knowledge to translate the ten commandments, the Lord's prayer, and other scriptures into the Algonquin language, to try converting the natives to Puritan Christianity. Although unintentional, Eliot also introduced the concept of written language as the natives did not previously have a phonetic alphabet; they communicated primarily through spoken language with their written language being mainly pictorial images (such as Egyptian hieroglyphs). =The Second Meeting House (1674‚Äì1741)= Due to a growth in population in Roxbury, as well as the inclusion of residents of Muddy River, who had no place of worship of their own until 1717, in the congregation, a new meeting house was built for the church. The first meeting in this new meeting house took place on November 15, 1674. On October 17, 1688, Nehemiah Walter was ordained as a pastor. Previously, the meeting house was full of just seats, but the first pews are built sometime around 1693. In 1706, residents from \\"Jamaica End\\" (the westerly part of Roxbury) asked the general court for permission to be made their own precinct and for help with building their own meeting house, which was denied. However, in 1711 they again made the same request signed by thirty-two people, and the request was granted; eighteen members from The First Church in Roxbury were sent off to form The Second Church in Roxbury. Thomas Walter was ordained as a pastor on October 19, 1718. The population of Roxbury continued to grow and finally, in March, 1736, the congregation once again brought up the subject of building a new meeting house; however they were unsure whether to build it on the same spot or to pick a new location. Finally, it was decided that the new meeting house would be built slightly north, and that the old meeting house was to be demolished once the new one began construction. =The Third Meeting House (1741‚Äì1744)= Again due to growing population, a larger meeting house was necessary and in the summer of 1741, the third meeting house was completed; the first meeting was held in the new building on August 31, 1741. However, a fire broke out in February 1743 (or 1744), and destroyed the meeting house. The congregation worshipped in the brick schoolhouse until a new meeting house was built. =The Fourth Meeting House (1744‚Äì1803)= Following the destruction by fire, the fourth meeting house was built on the same location and of the same design as the former third meeting house and was completed in 1746. It continued to serve the congregation as it always had until the American Revolutionary War broke out. The Siege of Boston From March 29, 1775 (a few weeks before the Siege of Boston, the opening phase of the Revolutionary War, began) until April 8, 1776 (a few weeks after the Siege ended) there were no public meetings held in the meeting house. During the siege, no religious meetings could be held and the meeting house served as a signal station for the army. As such, it was also a target for British bombs, and by the time the British retreated from Boston in 1776, the meeting house had been damaged by bombs in several places. As a result of the war, the members of the parish were scattered, and until 1782 there was no official minister for the church. Following the American Revolutionary War Once the church named a new pastor in 1782, the church and meeting house largely went back to serving the community and congregation as it always had. Various efforts were made to restore the meeting house following the damage, and in 1787, a group of men who lived near the meeting house presented the church with a clock, which was placed on the bell tower. It was also around this time that the church began officially referring to itself as a parish, rather than a precinct. On May 27, 1799, the church voted against building a new meeting house. However, in 1802, another vote was taken and it was decided that measures should be taken to start building a new meeting house for the congregation. Three different plans were submitted, and after one was chosen, it was decided that the old meeting house would be put up at auction. On April 17, 1803, the old meeting house was used by the congregation for the last time. =The Fifth Meeting House= The current structure, finished in 1804, is the fifth meetinghouse for First Church of Roxbury. It is listed as a major structure in the John Eliot Square National Register District, along with the Dillaway-Thomas House. The church is a two- story wood building with a bell tower, designed in the ‚ÄúFederal Meetinghouse‚Äù style.Boston Landmarks Commission, 1973. National Register of Historic Places Nomination Form: John Eliot Square. Retrieved 12-20-2019. It measures 80 by 70 feet, and has an approximate seating capacity of 800. The tower, which was reconstructed after a hurricane in 1954, contains a bell purchased in 1819 from the Paul Revere Foundry in Canton, Massachusetts that weighs 1538 pounds. The clock on the tower‚Äôs facade dates to 1863. The church membership became a religious society (the First Religious Society in Roxbury) affiliated with the Universalist church in 1825. Modern Day =Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry= The Unitarian Universalist Urban Ministry is a Roxbury, Boston, MA-based social justice organization focused on providing nonsectarian programs that focus on providing the community with \\"academic and enrichment programming for children and youth, emergency shelter for individuals and families fleeing from domestic violence, affordable housing and intentional community for young women, including transitional housing for those leaving shelter, and volunteer-based capacity-building services for Roxbury-serving nonprofits.\\"  Notes  References   External links Category:Unitarian Universalism Category:Tourist attractions in Roxbury, Boston Category:Buildings and structures in Boston Category:17th century in Boston Category:Churches in Boston Category:Unitarian Universalist churches in Massachusetts Category:Churches completed in 1632 Category:1632 establishments in Massachusetts ","title":"First Church in Roxbury"},{"id":"48394187","title":"Fleur De Lys Fillies' Stakes"},{"id":"48394190","text":"Question The Mark are a Welsh punkrock band from Cardiff, Wales. The band have released three EPs, Tearing Our Arms Off Through (2009), Smoke Signals (2012) and Nightmare On Misery Street (2018), one studio album, Idle Hands released in 2010, one official compilation album, 1096 Days Later released in 2012 and one 4 way compilation EP, Roaster released in 2013. History The band formed in 2009, composed of vocalist/guitarist & lyricist Tim 'Bunky' Davies, guitarist/backing vocalist Sparky, bassist BT and drummer Dai Hughes. Their first show was in Swansea supporting the US punk band Bridge And Tunnel on April 21, 2009. Their debut 7\\", Tearing Our Arms Off Through, was released on Exhume Industries in 2009. produced by Todd Campbell at Skwad studios in Wales. Following live dates around the UK drummer Dai Hughes left the band to be replaced with Bryn Feasey. In 2010, prior to recording the band's debut album, guitarist Sparky left the band to move to Australia and was replaced by Evil Turkey's guitarist Daniel 'Yogi' Young. Idle Hands was released on Seven Records the following year, produced once again by Todd Campbell at Skwad Studios in Wales. Towards the end of 2011, the group recruited drummer James Tilley to replace the departed Bryn Feasey and embarked on a series of shows across the UK before starting work on their next release. The EP Smoke Signals was written between December 2011 & February 2012 and recorded at Jamtown Studios in Bridgend, South Wales in April 2012 and released on Team Beard Records in July the same year to coincide with the band's first European tour. Bassist Ross Goldworthy was drafted in for the tour due to BT's university commitments. Upon returning to the UK the band returned to Jamtown to record two new tracks which were originally intended for a split 7\\" with the Scottish band Uniforms whom the band had toured with in 2011 but the project grew into a four-way split release 10\\" featuring two more Scottish bands - The Walking Targets and Sink Alaska. During 2013 the band completed several short UK tours, however bassist BT's commitments to university and his other band Pipedream saw Ross Goldworthy fill in on many of these dates. In November 2013, the Roaster 10\\" EP was released by Make That A Take records and Team Beard records. Drummer James Tiley left the band at the end of 2013 which caused a period of hiatus during 2014, during which the band were missed by many and hailed as one of the UK's most under-rated bands. In July 2014, the band were reunited with Bryn Feasey on drums and new bassist Rich James for a one off show with US punk supergroup The Implants. With a new tour planned for November 2014, the band started rehearsals with Not Since The Accident drummer Lewis Green filling in for the once again departed Bryn Feasey. The band then toured across the UK with Italian band Low Derive and US band Smoke Or Fire frontman Joe McMahon. During 2015, the band played sporadic shows across the UK whilst working on their second album with a demo version of a new track called 'Perk U Later' appearing on a compilation released by the US based Paper & Plastick records to announce the opening of a European branch of the label. Another unreleased track 'Pulling A Fast One' was released on the 'Book Yer Ane Fest IX' compilation released by Make That A Take Records in November 2015. The band played the annual charity music festival Book Yer Ane Fest held in Dundee, Scotland for the fourth consecutive year. During November and into December 2017, Question the Mark toured across the UK with a new guitarist, Rob Pascoe. Whilst in Scotland, the band played 3 sets over 2 days at Book Yer Ane Fest XI in Dundee and held in different venues across the city. Following sporadic shows across the UK during the early stages of 2018, Question The Mark joined up with Northern Irish band Lost Avenue in July for an 8-day tour of the UK, which included an appearance at the annual Skate Aid 5 festival in Stamford, Lincs. In October 2018, the band played their first US dates in Florida with shows in St. Petersburg & Tallahassee prior to their appearance at Fest 17 in Gainesville. Following their return to the UK, Sunderland based record label Little Rocket Records announced the signing of the band and the impending release of a new 7\\" featuring the band's new line up, which had been recorded at The Bunker studios in Sunderland earlier in the year by ex- Leatherface bassist Graeme Philliskirk to coincide with a 10 date UK tour in November / December. The dates with Chicago-based Canadian Rifle would include two sets at the 10th annual charity festival Book Yer Ane Fest in Dundee (Question The Mark re-released the track 'Whatgoesaroundcomesaround' for a benefit compilation album released by the festival organisers Make That A Take Records) and their first hometown show in Cardiff for over 6 months. =Current members= *Tim 'Bunky' Davies ‚Äî Lead vocals, guitar (2009‚Äìpresent), *Rob Pascoe ‚Äî Lead guitar, backing vocals (2017‚Äìpresent) *Rich James ‚Äî Bass guitar, backing vocals (2014‚Äìpresent) *Lewis Green ‚Äî Drums (2014‚Äìpresent) =Former members= *Daniel 'Yogi' Young ‚Äî Lead guitar, backing vocals (2010‚Äì2017) *Josh 'BT' Brunt-Torjussen ‚Äî Bass guitar, backing vocals (2009-2014) *Ross Goldworthy ‚Äî Bass guitar (2013-2014) *James Tilley ‚Äî Drums (2012-2013) *Bryn Feasey ‚Äî Drums (2010-2012) & (2014) *Dai Hughes ‚Äî Drums (2009-2010) Discography *Breaking Our Arms Off Through (7\\"EP) (2009) (Exhume Industries) *Idle Hands (LP) (2011) (Seven Records) *1096 Days & Counting (EP) (2012) (Team Beard Records) *Smoke Signals (EP) (2012) (Team Beard Records) *Roaster (EP) (2012) (Make That A Take Records / Team Beard Records) *Nightmare On Misery Street (7\\"EP) (2018) (Little Rocket Records) Compilations *In Transit (2011) (Seven Records) *Make Yer Ane Comp (2011) (Make That A Take Records) *Book Yer Ane Fest VI (2012) (Make That A Take Records) *Offbeat & Underground Vol. 1 (2012) (Renegade Sounds) *Don't Panic vol.1 (2012) (No Panic Records) *Make Yer Ane Comp IV (2013) (Make That A Take Records) *Fucking The Nation Everyday Vol. 5 (2013) (Punk Rockers Radio) *Book Yer Ane Fest VII (2013) (Make That A Take Records) *Dae Yer Ane Sampler (2013) (Make That A Take Records) *Make Yer Ane Comp V (2014) (Make That A Take Records) *Book Yer Ane Fest IX (2015) (Make That A Take Records) *Welcome To The UK (2015) (Paper & Plastick / Already Heard) *Full Moon Rising (2017) (Team Beard Records) *Book Yer Ane Fest XII (2018) (Make That A Take Records) References External links *Official website Category:Welsh punk rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 2009 Category:Musical groups from Cardiff ","title":"Question The Mark"},{"id":"48394195","text":"Kazuya Maeda can refer to: * Kazuya Maeda (footballer, born 1982) (ÂâçÁî∞ ÂíåÂìâ) - Japanese footballer * Kazuya Maeda (footballer, born 1984) (ÂâçÁî∞ Âíå‰πü) - Japanese footballer ","title":"Kazuya Maeda"},{"id":"48394204","text":"Michel Banabila (2009) Michel Banabila (born April 14, 1961 in Amsterdam, Netherlands), is a Dutch composer and sound artist.

In 2015 Hunnisett secured a bronze medal in the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha while representing Great Britain. Personal history Hunnisett was born in England in 1995 and grew up in East Grinstead, Sussex. Hunnisett, who has cerebral palsy, was educated at Treloar School before boarding at Valence School. Sporting career Hunnisett was first introduced to the club throw when it was suggested to her by teachers. She kept up the sport for pleasure and fitness but after training over her summer holidays the improvements in her throws led her to seek out a sports club, and she was selected at an athletics development day. She joined Kingston Athletics Club and Polytechnic Harriers. Hunnisett's first forays into competitive sports were at the Cerebral Palsy Sport Grand Prix in 2010 and 2011, where she threw sub tem metre distances. She was later classified as a F32 disability athlete, which meant she could officially compete at sporting meets. In 2012 Hunnissett entered the Lee Valley Indoor Disability Championships, winning the club throw with a distance of 14.59m. The following year she entered her first IPC Grand Prix, travelling to Germany to compete in Berlin. There she threw 12.17m to finish in third place. A week later she won first place at the England Athletics Senior Disability Championships with a distance of 16.28m. Her personal best in 2013 of 17.79m, achieved at the Kingston Open, placed her sixth in the world. In 2014 Hunnisett joined the Weir Archer Academy and was selected for the Great Britain team to compete in her first major international competition, the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships held in Swansea. Initially the club throw was to be contested as two events between the F32 and F51 athletes, but the competition was combined and the results decided by points. This left Hunnisett fourth just outside the medals with a throw of 18.52m. The following year Hunnisett entered three IPC Grand Prix events in the buildup to the 2015 IPC Athletics World Championships in Doha. Her first Grand Prix saw her travel to Nottwil in Switzerland where she threw a personal best of 19.24 to take first place. Hunnisett followed this with a second place at the Berlin Grand Prix. Her third Grand Prix saw Hunnisett compete at the Anniversary Games in London where she threw over twenty metres in a competitive competition for the first time with a result of 21.01m. At the World Championships, Hunnisett entered the F32 club throw. She fouled her first two throws, but managed a distance of 21.09 on her final attempt of the first round. She was unable to better this result in the second round, but the throw was good enough to see her secure her first major international podium finish with a bronze medal.

He is one of the early Indian writers in English. He was also a medical doctor and a music critic. Noronha has himself described The Dew Drop Inn as \\"not a political or historical story, neither a love story\\" and has said that he conceived of the idea and planned it in 1958, while in New York. He added: \\"Then, on December 18th, 1961, the Indian militia entered Goa and, after 36 hours that electrified the world, the mighty Portuguese Empire came crashing down with the maximum of drama possible. And I found myself with the MS [manuscript] of what was overnight virtually a historical novel.\\" Critic Peter Nazareth, who wrote a review of The Dew Drop Inn that was published in World Literature Today, said: \\"It is a sequel to The Mango and the Tamarind Tree: Raoul in the first novel gives up his lover (born in Kenya of a caste lower than his) because of pressure by his mother. In the sequel, Raoul regrets having given her up and he has now become gay --- there are explicit descriptions of the gay scene in Bombay. He dies, near the end, in a plane crash.\\" Some critics suggest that Raoul's story parallels the author's. The author was a doctor in England. He believes in the advice he once received there: that a trivial incident can change a life. This happens in the book too. Shantimarg is a fictitious montage of \\"all Himalayan hill stations\\". Medical colleges at Bombay and London get featured here too. This book in part is \\"to a great extent autobiographical, if highly dramatized\\". The Mango and the Tamarind Tree was Noronha's earlier novel. Another of his publications, Poems, was published by the Writers' Workshop in 1965. Agarwal and Sinha comment: \\"With a growing interest in Indian English literature, there has been a sudden spurt of fiction, many of them first novels during the nineteen seventies. Notable among those novelists are ‚Äî BK Karanjia, Leslie de Noronha, Timeri Murari, ...\\".Agrawal, B. R., and M. P. Sinha. Major Trends in the Post-Independence Indian English Fiction. Atlantic Publishers & Dist, 2003. Donna J Young describes his novel The Mango and the Tamarind Tree as offering an \\"insight into the feelings of Goans who had a Portuguese identity that changed into a Goan one after the end of the colonial period. On the surface, the novel deals with the affluent but disintegrating Albuquerque family. In reality, De Noronha is showing the disintegration of Portuguese identity in Goa by having the novel‚Äôs main character Raoul break with many traditions. He refuses to go through an arranged marriage, falls in love with a woman from a lower class, and he sells the family home after his mother‚Äôs death. Raoul‚Äôs heritage is his enemy. It kept him from marrying the woman he loved and from the international career he loved. By giving up his traditions Raoul symbolizes Goans giving up Portuguese traditions and shows the upheaval that frequently accompanies major political change and the reaction to it....\\" His work is included in The Golden Treasury of Indo-Anglian Poetry, 1828-1965, edited by Vinayak Krishna Gokak.

The film focuses on the Black Panther Party in Oakland, California, during protests over the arrest of Black Panther co-founder Huey P. Newton for the murder of police officer John Frey in 1967. Summary In the summer of 1968, people arrive in Oakland to protest Huey P. Newton's arrest. Newton is himself interviewed and talks about his poor treatment while incarcerated and also talks about the ideals of the Black Panther movement which includes protecting the black community from the police, informing them of their rights, and taking advantage of license to carry firearm laws in order to arm Panthers to police the police. Other people are interviewed, including Kathleen Cleaver who talks about the natural hair movement and the increasing importance of women in positions of authority in the Black Panther movement. The film ends with Newton's conviction for manslaughter and a hate crime involving two police officers shooting the window of a Black Panther office where Newton's picture had been hung in the front window.

The film explores the murals of Los Angeles, California.  Subject and style  The vast majority of the scenes of the film are shots of murals, all of which are located in the city of Los Angeles, often with the mural's painter or model staged in front of the mural for dramatic effect. The film alternates between voiceover narration by Agn√®s Varda and commentary about the murals provided by the murals' creators, as well as commentary provided by locals living in the area. The film also includes several musical performances, including by Chicano punk band Los Illegals. A significant amount of the film's attention is focused on work by Chicano artists, although artists from other backgrounds are also covered extensively. The film also dwells on the role of state violence, both as it affects the communities the murals are situated in and the murals themselves. The film's title is a pun: literally \\"Wall Walls\\" in French, Varda suggests that the murals on the walls are in fact murmuring to each other. Production and release Mur Murs was produced by Varda alongside Documenteur: An Emotion Picture, a drama film about a French woman living in Los Angeles, set against the same murals that are the subject of Mur Murs and starring several of the people who worked on Mur Murs. The film was screened at the 1981 Cannes Film Festival.  Reception and legacy  A contemporary review in The New York Times written for a screening of the film at a film festival described the film as \\"lively and energetic\\". In a review published by Film School Rejects about a Criterion Collection box set of Agn√®s Varda's films shot in California, Farah Cheded describes Mur Murs's as having \\"perfect composition\\" in its depiction of \\"dazzlingly painted\\" walls.

Ancestry Roger was the son of Roger la Zouch, Lord of Lubbesthorpe (d.1303), the younger brother of William la Zouche, 1st Baron Zouche of Harringworth. He was the grandson of Eudo la Zouch and Millicent, daughter of William III de Cantilupe, a close friend of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester. Roger's aunt, Eva, was married to the rebel Maurice de Berkeley, 2nd Baron Berkeley who was imprisoned by the Despencers in Wallingford Castle and died there in 1326. Eva's son, Thomas de Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley was entrusted with guarding the deposed Edward II in his castle but was relieved of his duty when others decided Edward was to be treated \\"less gentley\\" and died in suspicious circumstances. Career and Life Roger was a supporter of Thomas, Earl of Lancaster for which he received a pardon from the king in August 1318. Zouch fought at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March 1322. In January 1324 Roger was accused of raiding Hugh Despencer the Elder's lands at Loughborough and elsewhere in Leicestershire, although in a warrant issued the previous year it had been his son Roger, jnr who had been named. The corrupt Baron of the Exchequer Roger de Beler, who was viewed as a traitor by the Contrariants, was one of those appointed to arrest la Zouch. In 1325 Sir Roger was appointed as a Commissioner of Warwickshire and Leicestershire but was replaced in November after claiming he was detained through sickness. On 24 March 1326 the Sheriff of Leicestershire was ordered to seize the lands of Sir Roger la Zouch, Lord of Lubbesthorpe as he had been indicted of \\"assenting to and counselling\\" the death of the Baron of the Exchequer, Roger de Beler, which had been carried out by the Folville Gang. Roger fled from Leicestershire first to Wales and then probably Paris where Mortimer and the Queen were in court and his cousin Eudo la Zouch died a month later. Demise Following Isabella and Mortimer's successful Invasion of England in 1326, Edward and the Despencers were killed and pardons were issued to the men that had been accused of killing Beler. Roger la Zouch did not immediately reappear, and in 1328 his manor of Lubbesthorp was granted to his uncle William la Zouch, Lord of Harringworth who was Roger's overlord. By 1330 a Roger la Zouch had been appointed as Sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire, represented Leceistershire in Parliament in 1331 and 1337 and was again holding the manor of Lubbesthorp. Whether this was the Roger la Zouch who was exiled and returned, his son or the son of William la Zouche of Harringworth is debatable. Family Roger had the following issue: * Ralph la Zouch * Roger la Zouch Both Ralph and Roger, jnr. were Contrariants that were accused of raiding Despencer's lands at Loughborough in 1323 and of being members of the Folville Gang that assassinated the corrupt Baron of the Exchequer, Sir Roger de Beler in January 1326 shortly before the overthrow of Edward II by his wife, Isabella and her lover Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March.

Archive shot from 1913 Stockport Central Library is a Carnegie library in Stockport Greater Manchester England. It was built in 1913-15 to designs by Bradshaw, Gass and Hope in the Edwardian Baroque style and as of 2018 continues to serve as Stockport's largest library. Location It is situated in the corner of St Petersgate and the 'new' road, Wellington Road South. The north south axis of the town had changed in 1826 with the opening of the new bridge and the new turnpike, the straight wide Wellington Roads. That relieved the 1724 turnpike that used Lancashire Hill, Lancashire Bridge, Gt Underbank and Hillgate, of the Manchester to Derby through traffic. So in 1875 the market place and St Mary's church had lost their prestige. New civic buildings were planned for Wellington Road South. The first building on the St Petersgate, Wellington Road South site was a mechanics institute. History The first relevant date for public libraries was 1850 when the Public Libraries Act 1850 gave Municipal Boroughs such as Stockport the power to fund public libraries. The first Stockport Library was opened in 1875 in the market over the cheese hall. This less than satisfactory, an 1885 report stated \\"The ventilation of all the rooms is bad...There is not sufficient outlet for bad air which at certain times is overpowering. The air in the large reading room is particularly bad, being impregnated with the stench coming from the hall underneath\\". It was condemned in 1890 and replaced 23 years later. In neighbouring Reddish, Houldsworth has built Baths, and a Library for his workers in 1907. Stockport Central Library was built in 1913 with the assistance of Andrew Carnegie, a industrialist turned philanthropist. Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919) was born in Scotland and emigrated to America with his family in 1848. His father was a weaver and his mother was a shoemakers daughter. He worked in a cotton mill as a pirner (U.S. Bobbin boy) then as an engine tenter, a telegraph messenger and operator. He also worked as a telegraph operator on the American railways and foreseeing future demand for iron and steel, he founded his own company in 1873, concentrating on steel. His companies prospered despite a depression and in 1901 were consolidated, and sold forming the United States Steel Corporation. With a personal fortune of $480 million, he endowed 2509 libraries worldwide and 660 libraries in Britain. Initially, Andrew Carnegie offered Stockport Corporation ¬£10,000 for the erection of a free central library. The design was put out to competition and Bradshaw & Gass submitted a design costing ¬£14,000. The Carnegie assessor, Percy S Worthington, award the 'premium' to them in October 1910. Ihis was over budget, and Andrew Carnegie increased his offer to ¬£15,000 on condition that the Corporation provided a further ¬£2,000 to build a branch library in another part of the town. Tenders were sought in September 1911, the full design drawings were supplied in 1913, and the building was completed in 1914. The final statement of accounts show it cost ¬£15,000.10.6d. Building It was built by Bradshaw Gass & Hope- one of a series of libraries the built on the strength of their design for Bolton Library. The library is of red brick and Portland stone, in the Edwardian Baroque style complete with prominent corner dome with a tall finial. The entrance is offset by one bay along the Wellington Road south elevation. This too is flanked by banded brick pilasters, and surmounted by heavy stone carvings. This and a symmetrically matching bay has a tall arched window, cornice and cartouche in the frieze. in between is a five-window range with an attic storey with small windows. A rusticated basement takes advantage of the fall of the land; the elevation to St Petersgate is broadly similar to the Wellington Street South elevation but with basement windows. The ground floor library has arcades and a glazed dome supported by Ionic columns, with stained glass windows with the names of writers. It has been locally listed, as Building 473. Facilities In 2015 it functions as a reference library, a family history centre and a lending library six days a week on reduced hours, closing at 5.00pm on Wednesday and Thursday, and 4.00 on a Saturday but maintaining its service to 7.00pm on the other days.

It recommended that his certificate be suspended for a period of one year. The court also expressed the opinion that had the ship's boats remained alongside as they were ordered to do, rather than making for Hong Kong as they did, then the four lives lost might have been saved.

For RNA specificity, GLD-2 associates with an RNA-binding protein, typically a GLD-3, to form a heterodimer that acts as a cytoplasmic PAP. This protein has an enzymatic function and belongs to a family (DNA polymerase type-B-like family) which includes several similar enzymes such as GLD-1, GLD-3 and GLD-4. This family of cytoplasmic PAPs has been described in several different species including Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus, Mus musculus and Drosophila. Moreover, as it is a cytoplasmtaic PAP it differs from nuclear PAPs in some aspects. While nuclear PAPs contain a catalytic domain and an RNA-binding domain, GLD-2 family members have only a catalytic domain.  Localization  GLD-2 is a common and abundant, but yet quite unknown protein that has already been found in each of the five kingdoms. In the animal kingdom, it has been specially detected in Homo sapiens, Drosophila, Xenopus and Mus musculus. However, there has also been noticed the presence of GLD-2 in Arabidopsis thaliana which belongs in the plants kingdom; Escherichia Coli in monera and Candida albicans in fungi. In human beings it is mostly expressed in the brain and within it, in the cerebellum, hippocampus and medulla. We can also find them in some other source tissues are the fibroblast, HeLa cell, MCF-7 cell, melanoma cell line and thymus. Inside those cells, it can be located in the nucleus and mitochondrion since its main function is related with DNA polyadenilation and these cell organelles are the only ones were DNA can be found. However, there are also GLD-2 in a soluble way in the cytosol, although the reason why they are there is still unsure. In Escherichia Coli, this enzymatic protein can be found in the cell membrane and in the cytosol, whereas in Drosophila melanogaster, it predominates in the brain's nucleus and cytoplasm, oocyte, ovary and testis‚Äô cells. Finally, in the Arabidopsis thaliana, it is located in the flower's nucleus, root, stem and leaf cells.  Related functions  GLD-2 primarily stabilizes mRNAs that are translationally repressed as well as it strongly promotes bulk polyadenylation. Surprisingly, those functions seem to have little impact on dynamizing efficient target mRNA translation, as it is an efficient Poly(A) Polymerase which helps developing polyadenylation activity. This activity is stimulated by its interaction with a putative RNA- binding protein: GLD-3. It is proposed by some studies that GLD-3 stimulates GLD-2 by recruiting it to the RNA. If so, then bringing GLD-2 to the RNA by other means also should stimulate its activity. = Molecular function =  ATP binding  GLD-2, as a poly(A) polymerase (PAP) acts incorporating ATP at the 3' end of mRNAs in a template-independent manner.  Enzymatic activity: Polynucleotide adenylyltransferase activity  It has been discovered that this protein has a catalytic activity, in other words, it has the ability to increase the speed of chemical reactions which would not occur so fast. It is known to catalysis the following reaction (which requires the following cofactor: Mg(2+)): ATP + RNA(n) ‚áÑ diphosphate + RNA(n+1) Depending on the surroundings the optimal pH varies from 8 in the cytoplasm to 8.3 in the nucleus. = Biological process =  Hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation  The GLD-2 protein together with 136 proteins more, is involved in the molecular process of hematopoietic progenitor cell differentiation, in the human proteome. This is the process in which precursor cell type acquires the specialized features of a hematopoietic progenitor cell, a kind of cell types including myeloid progenitor cells and lymphoid progenitor cells.  mRNA processing by RNA polyadenylation  The polyadenylation activity of GLD-2, as we previously mentioned, is stimulated by physical interaction with an RNA binding protein, GLD-3. To test whether GLD-3 might stimulate GLD-2 by recruiting it to RNA, some studies tethered C. elegans GLD-2 to mRNAs in Xenopus oocytes by using MS2 coat protein. Tethered GLD-2 adds poly(A) and stimulates translation of the mRNA, demonstrating that recruitment is sufficient to stimulate polyadenylation activity. PAP heterodimer in which GLD-2 contains the active site and GLD-3 provides RNA- binding specificity. MS2 coat protein was joined to GLD-2 to recruit it to an RNA. Furthermore, GLD-2 activity is also important to maintain or up-regulate the abundance of many mRNAs, as the cytoplasmic polyadenylation has an essential role in activating maternal mRNA translation during early development. In vertebrates, the reaction requires CPEB, an RNA-binding protein and the poly(A) polymerase GLD-2. The Xenopus enzyme, which exists in two closely related forms, polyadenylates RNAs to which it is tethered and enhances their translation. Likewise, it interacts with cytoplasmic polyadenylation factors, including Cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor and CPEB, and with target mRNAs. These findings confirm and extend a recent report that a GLD-2 enzyme is the long-sought PAP responsible for cytoplasmic polyadenylation in oocytes. In addition, the formation of long- term memory is believed to lack translational control of localized mRNAs. In mammals, dendrite mRNAs are kept in a repressed state and are activated upon repetitive stimulation. Several regulatory proteins required for translational control in early development are thought to be needed for memory formation, suggesting similar molecular mechanisms. In an experiment using Drosophila, it has been detected the enzyme responsible for poly(A) elongation in the brain and it has been demonstrated too that its activity is required specifically for long-term memory. These findings provide strong evidence that cytoplasmic polyadenylation is critical for memory formation, and that GLD2 is the responsible enzyme.  Medical implications  It has also been discovered that GLD2 has medical uses. For example, such enzyme is overexpressed in patients who suffer from cancer; that's why it can be used as a prognostic factor for early appearance in breast cancer patients. Moreover, PAP activity is used to measure the effect of anticancer drugs as etoposide and cordycepin in two carcinoma cell lines: HeLa, which is the human epithelioid cervix carcinoma, and MCF-7 (human breast cancer). However, in spite its utilities it can also be involved in the expression of several common diseases such as: leukemia, liver cirrhosis, brain injuries, hepatitis and in some cases infertility in male patients.

Ancestry The Folvilles had their seat at Ashby Folville, Leicestershire since at least 1137 when its lordship was held by Fulk de Folville. The family name, ultimately derived from Folleville in the French region of Picardy, is attached to several other sites in Leicestershire, such as the deserted village of Newbolt Folville.The Battle Abbey Roll: with some account of the Norman lineages, ed. by Catherine L.W. Primrose, 3 vols. (London: John Murray, 1889), I, 17 The family seems to have gained most their estate at the beginning of the 12th century. Several of their possessions, such as Ashby and the manor at Teigh, were in the hands of other parties at the time of the Domesday survey, but had passed to the Folvilles by the reign of Stephen (1135‚Äì1154). The family were well-established in Leicestershire by the mid 13th-century. In 1240 a member of the family donated a large sum to the church at Cranoe. The Folvilles were rebels during both Barons Wars; Sir William Folville (d. c. 1240) had his lands seized for his part in the First Barons' War in 1216 and Sir Eustace Folville (murdered in 1274) was one of the knights appointed to enforce the Provisions of Oxford in 1258 and stoutly defended Kenilworth Castle after the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Career and Life Folville was summoned with horses and arms to a Military Council before the King's teenage son and Lieutenant of England held at Rochester, Kent in September 1297, a few days before the English defeat at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. John was ordered to muster at Newcastle Upon Tyne for service against the Scots in December. King Edward soon returned from his expedition to Flanders and took charge of matters in Scotland and gained revenge at the Battle of Falkirk the next summer. In 1299 Folville helped defend Edinburgh Castle and was again summoned in June 1301 to join the King in his two-pronged attack which aimed to capture the whole of Scotland. Folville served as MP for Rutland in 1298 and 1301 and as MP for Leicestershire from 1300 to 1306. In 1304 he was accused of breaking into the home of William Hubert of Teigh and carrying away charters and muniments but appears to have been excused as in 1306 he was appointed as a commissioner to enquire into progress on the building of a prison in Leicester. In December 1309 he was appointed as a Justice of Leicestershire to receive complaints of violations of the Statute of Stamford. Folville died in 1310 and an inquisition held found that he owned Ashby Folville for the service of two Knight's fees. Folville's wife Alice outlived him but found herself in trouble when she was imprisoned in Lincoln prison in September 1332, perhaps in relation to some of her sons' activities.

Himself a descendant of the Vivians of Trewan, Cornwall, he was the first member of this branch of the family to settle in South Wales, where he became the ancestor of the Vivian baronets and barons. He was the son of Reverend Thomas Vivian (died 17 March 1793) and Mary Hussey (1 February 1719 ‚Äì circa 24 December 1807), of Truro St. Mary, Cornwall, who had been married on 30 November 1747 at Kenwyn, Cornwall. Career About 1800, John Vivian moved from Truro in Cornwall to Swansea in South Wales and assumed the post of managing partner in the copper works at Penclawdd and Loughor owned by the Cheadle Brasswire Company of Staffordshire. By 1806 his second son, John Henry Vivian (1785‚Äì1855), was made manager of the copper works at Penclawdd. In 1808-1810, the Vivians leased land at the Hafod in Swansea from the Duke of Beaufort and the Earl of Jersey for use by their new firm of Vivian & Sons. The Vivian copper mining, smelting and trading businesses in Swansea eventually developed into the largest conglomerate of its kind in South Wales, and the Vivian family did much to develop Swansea into a city, in much the same way as the Marquesses of Bute drove the development of Cardiff. The partners in the family business were John Vivian and his two elder sons, John Henry (1785‚Äì1855) and Richard (1775‚Äì1842). Richard was the older but was fully occupied in his military career; it was John Henry who became managing partner in the company.Thomas (1966)Morris (1995) Richard later commanded the 6th Brigade of the Earl of Uxbridge's Cavalry Division in the Battle of Waterloo and was created Baron Vivian in 1841.

Membership in the Society reflects the different groups interested in addressing these challenges including commercial firms, academic institutions, government bodies, publishers and other related organizations, both national and international. Founding In 1965, the Geoscience Information Society was formed to ‚Äúinitiate, aid, and improve the exchange of information in the earth sciences through mutual cooperation and to deal with the many problems created by the explosion of literature in the geosciences, including that of the shortage of trained personnel to staff geoscience libraries.‚Äù The Society was officially incorporated in March of the following year. Initial concerns that led to the founding of GSIS included a lack of communication among librarians handling geological collections and the status of bibliographic control in geological literature. General concerns were identified as the use of ‚ÄúIBM equipment‚Äù to control geological literature, to develop bibliographic control of master's theses and doctoral dissertations in geology, to conduct case studies of library habits of geologists, and to serve as a coordinator for other geology librarians to exchange ideas. Specific concerns included dissemination of hard-copy materials to working geologists, an index of field trip guidebooks and conference proceedings, review articles, services of state survey libraries, geological mapping, abstracting and indexing services, geological thesauri, and standardizing citations. At that time, the National Committee on Geology was concerned with these same issues. Also, AGI had become interested in geological documentation. The first meeting to address these concerns was an all-day panel discussion entitled ‚ÄúGeology Library Problems‚Äù held during the 1964 GSA Annual Meeting. The meeting arose out of a shared interest between geologists and librarians to work on their mutual problems. There were three options considered in the formation of the society: to affiliate with a library or information organization, to affiliate with a geological or scientific organization, or to form an independent organization. Guiding principles were that anyone involved in geoscience information activities could participate and the need for communication and cooperation between everyone, information people and scientists. One hundred invitations were sent to both information professionals and interested geologists for an organization meeting to be held November 5, 1965 at the GSA meeting in Kansas City, MO. The assembled geology and science librarians, geologists, documentalists, editors and information specialists adopted a constitution and completed the organization of an independent group whose purpose would be to initiate, aid, and improve the exchange of information in the earth sciences through mutual cooperation and to deal with the many problems created by the explosion of literature in the geosciences, including a shortage of trained personnel to staff geoscience libraries. The first officers were: Mark Pangborn as President, Harriet Smith as Secretary/President-elect, Harriet Long as Treasurer, and Ruth Bristol as ‚ÄúPast President.‚Äù History GSIS was founded to ‚Äúimprove the exchange of information in the geosciences.‚Äù Over the years the particular concerns of the society have changed as the information needs of the members have changed. Topics of concern have included developments in formats and methods of production, evolving systems of communication, digitization of data, preservation of the literature, and handling of the data sets and sample collections. Further concerns include budgetary limitations and its effect on scholarly communication as well as the various methods of communication and that subsequent effect on the channels of information. GSIS and its members continue to address emerging information trends in the geosciences, including open access and other scholarly communications issues, such as copyright, author rights, and predatory publishers.Zellmer, D., Hardy, S., and Bielskas, A. ‚ÄúOpen Access in the Geosciences‚Äù.

History  The arch was dedicated to Diocletian either for the occasion of his decennalia in 293 AD, or his triumph celebrated with Maximian in 303‚Äì304. The name Arcus novus (new arch) probably refers to the earlier Arch of Claudius on the same street.  Description  The Arcus Novus was decorated with reliefs reused (spolia) from a large altar of the Julio- Claudian period, most probably the Ara pietatis, while the column plinths were decorated with images of Victoria, barbarian prisoners and the Dioskouri, probably from the facade of the nearby Temple of the Sun of Aurelian. The arch was destroyed in 1491 by order of Pope Innocent VIII during reconstruction of Santa Maria in Via Lata. Fragments of the reliefs were discovered in 1523 and added to the Della Valle collection before being acquired by Cardinal Ferdinand de' Medici in 1584, from where the plinths found their way to the Boboli Gardens in Florence. Other fragments from the Antonine period, reused by Diocletian, were included in the rear facade of the cardinal's Villa Medici in Rome.

It comprises 19,333 houses, including single- and multifamily structures. The Tejon Ranch Company has agreed to set aside 18% of housing as affordable housing. The developers have stated they plan to attract local jobs in order to employ the anticipated number of adult residents. The projected population is 57,000.Patric Hedlund, \\"'Surprise' Centennial Testimony Is Actually Deja Vu,\\" The Mountain Enterprise, June 15, 2018, page 1 The project lies between a point about a mile east of the intersection of Interstate 5 and California Highway 138 eastward past Quail Lake into the western Antelope Valley to about 280th Street West. The 19.3-square-mile project is planned to be developed by four companies: Tejon Ranch Company, Lewis Operating Company, Pardee Homes and Standard Pacific Homes, on the property of Tejon Ranch. Public reaction Environmental groups have opposed the housing project, claiming that it would be built on rare ecosystems, including the largest native grassland left in California, among other concerns. The project is planned on the territory inhabited by four federally endangered or threatened animals, including the critically endangered California condor, and 23 animals and plants listed by under the California Endangered Species Act. The Tejon Pass area also functions as a wildlife corridor connecting the Tehachapi Mountains, the Mojave Desert, the Sierra Nevada, and the Central Valley. In 2008, an agreement was reached between developers and the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Audubon Society of California, the Endangered Habitats League, and the Planning and Conservation League. The agreement stated that 90% of Tejon Ranch would be protected if the conservation groups agreed not to oppose development on the remaining 10%. Erecting structures would be forbidden, but the ranch could continue to be used for \\"profitable agriculture, mining, grazing and exclusive commercial hunting operations.\\" Opponents of the agreement claim that much of the land is too steep and remote to be buildable and that Tejon's biodiversity is protected under the existing and federal laws. A draft environmental impact report was released on May 17, 2017. A public hearing on June 29 drew a \\"handful of people.\\" In April 2019, the largest of the most vocal environmental groups in opposition to the project, the Center for Biological Diversity and the California Native Plant Society, filed a suit against the County Board of Supervisors. The suit claims the Board's approval of the Centennial project violated the California Environmental Quality Act and asks that development be halted until a new environmental review is completed. Another major concern is traffic congestion on Interstate 5 and Highway 138 as the development is far from many jobs. Concerns also include an increase of valley fever caused by the release of dust-borne spores during construction, insufficient water supply, and \\"poorly designed\\" wildlife corridors.Patric Hedlund, \\"Water, Traffic, Valley Fever, Wildlife, Poor Outreach Raised at Thinly Attended Centennial Hearing,\\" The Mountain Enterprise, July 7, 2017, page 1 The site is located in \\"high\\" and \\"very high\\" fire hazard severity zones as defined by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

It offers a 16MP sensor supporting 1080p video capture, intrusion protection, and is able to connect with smartphones through a dedicated application. Reception to the camera has been mostly positive. Design The design of the HTC RE Camera has been described as \\"a tube that's bent on one end, slightly narrower than a roll of quarters\\" by Android Central, \\"more periscope than box\\" and \\"an upside down asthma inhaler\\" by Digital Trends and The Verge, and \\"a strange little thing that resembles an elbow of a pipe, an inhaler, a periscope, or who knows what else\\" by PhoneArena. The camera measures 96.7 x 26.5 mm and weighs 65.5 grams. The camera supports IP57 protection, with IPx7 protection while used standalone and IPx8 protection when used with a cap. The camera has a Sony-made 16 megapixel 1/2.3\\" CMOS sensor with f/2.8 aperture scratch- resistant lens. The battery is an 820 mAh unit, supporting 1 hour and 40 minutes of 1080p video recording or 1,200 16-megapixel photos. The HTC RE Camera does not include a power button. Instead, it includes a grip sensor that allows the camera to be turned on by holding it in a hand. The capturing of videos and photos is done through the shutter button, a large silver button at the top of the device. Photos are taken by tapping on the button, and videos are taken by pressing and holding on the button. LED lighting embedded in the button shows the status of the camera. Videos and photos are recorded onto a microSD card inserted into the bottom of the camera, which supports a microSD card of up to 128 GB, but HTC provides an 8 GB card. Apart from a microSD card slot, the bottom of the device also includes a 20-thread tripod screw socket and a microUSB port for battery charging and data transfer. A separate RE application supports smartphone devices with Android 4.3 or later and iOS 7 or later. The application connects the phone with the camera over Bluetooth 4.0 and Wi-Fi. The application allows using the camera as a viewfinder, adjusting the settings of the camera such as resolution, frame rate and time lapse, and transferring videos and photos from the camera to the smartphone. Reception The HTC RE Camera received generally positive reviews. Joshua Goldman of CNET gave the camera a 7.2 out of 10, noting the simplicity of the camera, the waterproof feature, and mobile application as its good points, and shutter lag, mediocre video and photo quality, non- removable battery, and slippery body as its bad points. Brad Molen of Engadget gave the camera a 75 out of 100, saying that the advantages of the device was that it was \\"fun to use\\", small and lightweight, comfortable while used with one hand, waterproof, and can be used standalone from a smartphone, while the disadvantages were that the camera quality was not better than most flagship smartphones, slightly high price, lack of HDR, flashlight and other features, subpar iOS app, average battery life, and odd-looking wide angle shots. PhoneArena gave the camera a 7 out of 10, noting that the camera was quick to capture photos, and the grip was comfortable, but also noted that the image quality in low light was sub-par, the video recording lacked sharpness, shutter speeds were too slow and lacked manual adjustment, low battery life, mediocre audio recording quality, lack of optical image stabilization, and steep pricing. Les Shu of Digital Trends gave the camera a 3.5 out of 5, listing its design, wide-angle lens, ease of use, and photo quality as its strengths, and the reliance on the standalone app, video quality, short battery life, and high price as its weaknesses.

It now has a late 20th century shop front, but the timber-framed building survives with the southern front facing the narrow Akrill‚Äôs passage, on the east side of the High Street and just to the south of the railway crossing. History Akrill's Passage, Lincoln by A E Wright c1880 Surprisingly little is known about this building. The name Akrill refers to a baker who owned the property in the early part of the 19th. century. Padley, who made scaled drawings of the buildings in 1851 said that traditionally it was thought to be part of the White or Carmelite Friary in Lincoln. Adjacent to it at the east end was a small stone building with a Norman arch.Photograph of c1955 As the Carmellite friary has now been shown by archaeological excavation to have been under St Mark‚Äôs Station, on the opposite side of the High Street, it is unlikely that the building was associated with the friary. It has been alternatively suggested that the Whitefriars was the half-timbered vicarage of St Mary le Wigford church but there is documentary evidence that in 1563 it was owned by Arthur Hall, an important Grantham merchant- this appears to be the same Arthur Hall who was the M.P. for Grantham. The building may have been a speculative commercial, attracting superior tenants who would sell from the ground floor chamber and live with their family on the first floor.\\"Stocker\\" (2016), p.16 Restoration work was undertaken to the building in 1963.lincstothepast Whitefriars, High Street, Lincoln .By J.

Its initial offering was Florida homeowners insurance.http://www.tampabay.com/news/business/banking/progressive-buying- majority-stake-of-american-strategic-insurance/2210393 The company has experienced rapid growth and is now expected to offer coverage nationwide by 2017, establishing its place in the top 15 homeowners insurance providers in the United States. ASI is headquartered in St. Petersburg, Florida. These expansion goals are largely attributed to its acquisition by Progressive in April 2015. While this transaction allowed Progressive to have a controlling interest of 67%, Progressive has owned as much as 5% since 2012. Progressive paid $875 million for the acquisition.http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/national/2014/12/16/350221.htm The strategic partnership between the two companies is meant to allow them to compete in the coveted insurance \\"bundling\\" market. Despite the acquisition, ASI still operates as an independent company, with CEO John Auer as its head.  History  ASI's three company values (Attitude, Speed and Innovation) are displayed throughout the company's headquarters. ASI moved their headquarters in 2013 to a new campus built to withstand a Category 5 hurricane. The 13-acre campus holds two company buildings, and includes an employee gym and an R'Club child care facility. R'Club Child Care, Inc., a nonprofit child care provider in Pinellas County, Florida, opened its new location at ASI's campus in 2014, offering over 200 slots with priority given to ASI employees. ASI has also been a Better Business Bureau Accredited Business since 2004, and currently holds a rating of A+. ASI was one of several major homeowners insurance carriers tested by the Atlantic hurricane season of 2004, which included Hurricane Charley, Hurricane Frances, Hurricane Ivan and Hurricane Jeanne. The 2004 hurricane season was the company's first opportunity for a strong impression with policyholders. ASI's current expansion goals are largely attributed to its acquisition by Progressive in April 2015. While this transaction allowed Progressive to have a controlling interest of 67%, Progressive has owned as much as 5% since 2012. Progressive paid $875 million for the acquisition. The strategic partnership between the two companies allows them to compete in the coveted insurance bundling market. Despite the acquisition, ASI still operates as an independent company, with CEO John Auer as its head. Segments ASI currently sells homeowners, dwelling fire, renters, condo, commercial property, flood and umbrella coverage. Their policies are sold through over 7,000 appointed independent agencies. These agents are able to bundle ASI homeowners products with Progressive auto policies as long as the agents are appointed with both companies. ASI began offering a private flood insurance product as an alternative to the NFIP in Florida. However, the company is currently taking what CEO John Auer calls \\"a cautious stance\\" with excess flood and private flood insurance policies, by only writing homes that are 2,500 feet away from water on the West coast of Florida and 1,000 feet away from the water on the East coast of the state.  Subsidiary Companies  ASI functions as an insurance group with multiple insurance companies under the parent company ARX Holding Corp. These subsidiaries include: * American Strategic Insurance Corp. * ASI Lloyds * ASI Assurance Corp. * ASI Preferred Insurance Corp. * ASI Select Insurance Corp. * American Capital Assurance Corp. * ASI Home Insurance Corporation * ASI Underwriters * ASI Underwriters of Texas, Inc. * Safe Harbour Underwriters, LLC Notable Personnel John Auer, president and CEO at ASI, serves as a Board member and Chair-Elect of the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund Advisory. Previously, John was appointed to Florida's Property and Casualty Reform Committee's technical advisory council. He also served on Boards of the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association and the Insurance Institute for Property Loss Reduction (now the Institute for Business & Home Safety).American Strategic Insurance  About Us url = https://americanstrategic.com/AboutUs/management.aspx Auer also attended the first Florida Flood Insurance Conference in 2015. Angel Conlin, general counsel at ASI serves as the chair of the Florida Insurance Council Executive Committee and Board. Community Involvement \\"The Battery Project\\" is an annual campaign that ASI has done from their inception. Each year, they mail 9-volt batteries to their policyholders to remind them of the importance of ensuring their smoke alarms are working and have adequate power. ASI CEO, John Auer, has been quoted as saying ‚ÄúASI can repair your home, but we can't replace you or your loved ones.‚Äù In 2015, ASI ran a fundraiser for Southeastern Guide Dogs (a nonprofit organization that trains guide dogs for the vision impaired and for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder) to assist in building a new 20,000-square-foot puppy academy building.  Awards and Recognitions  In 2015, ASI was named on the Best Companies To Work For In Florida list by Florida Trend for the seventh year in a row, and one of the Top Workplaces in Tampa Bay by the Tampa Bay Times for the sixth year in a row. In 2016, ASI CEO John Auer won the Engaged Philanthropist Award at the 11th Annual WEDU Be More Awards, which recognizes individuals who distinguish themselves in the nonprofit community by engaging entrepreneurial skills to build a successful nonprofit endeavor. Finances ASI has a strong financial strength rating of A (Excellent) by AM Best Co. In a financial stability rating done on Florida specific homeowners insurance carriers, ASI was one of only two private corporations that the group recommended as stable. In 2012, three affiliates of ASI‚ÄîASI Assurance Corp., ASI Preferred Insurance Corp. and ASI Lloyds‚Äîalso received an A (Excellent) rating by AM Best Co. Two other affiliates, American Capital Assurance Corp. and ACA Home Insurance Corp., were upgraded from a B++ rating to an A rating.

Of Aragonese origin, it was translated into many languages and served as the basis for current international maritime law. When setting the first Consulate of the Sea in Valencia, king Peter III of Aragon decided to apply the maritime customs of Barcelona, called costums de mar, which had not yet been codified, although there did already exist in Barcelona another compilation of maritime rules, called Ordinacions de Ribera, which established norms for policing harbours and coastal waters.'' The merit of the Book of the Consulate of the Sea is that it is the first work to collect the scattered laws and customs of Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Rhodian, Italian, French and Spanish maritime rights. Until the publication of the Ordonnance de la Marine in France in 1681,forward - propos.pdf maritime Code. Avant-propos the Book of the Consulate of the Sea was the code of maritime law in force throughout the Mediterranean. In Spain it continued in use until the introduction of the Spanish Commercial Code. The Book of the Consulate of the Sea effectively replaced the Amalfi Tables, a set of rules written in Amalfi to regulate maritime trade.Maritime law history  Origin  According to Chiner and Chacon, the Ordinances of the Ribera (i.e. seaside) ( Ordianationis Ripairi≈ì ), written in 1258, did not yet encode the maritime customs of Barcelona, and that the first reference to \\"Sea consuls\\" appears in Barcelona in 1282, just one year before the Consulate of the Sea was created in Valencia. Also note that the consuls of Barcelona had no independence assigned later on in the Book of the Consulate of the Sea. Customs collected in the book would be in part coming from a Barcelona origin, but many would have been created and consolidated in Valencia, from which have been copied to the subsequently created consulates. According to Arcadi Garcia Sanz, the main difference between the consulates of Barcelona and Valencia would be the fact that the latter had from the start a \\"royal jurisdiction\\", and therefore has influenced so strongly in the other consulates in the fifteenth century. Customs Consulate were explicitly based on the Usus at consuetudo Maris according to the privilege of founding of the December 1 of 1283, which was a juridic set of maritime practices (Usus Maris) based on a written legal text (Consuetudo Maris) and both together would be the jur√≠dicomar√≠tima tradition of the western Mediterranean. is documented that the text was already in Catalonia, as it was in Vic 1231, and was incorporated in Catalan in the 'Custom of Tortosa in 1272. This paper certainly come from outside the Peninsula and have introduced through \\"maritime Costums of Ribera\\" from Barcelona. The General Encyclopedia of the Sea says there is a controversy on the origin of the book, in which three countries dispute the glory of being the first to have written it: France (Marseille), Spain (Valencia, Barcelona and Tortosa) and Italy (Pisa). In the late eighteenth century, Antonio de Capmany y Montpalau concludes, after deeply studying the subject, that the Book of the Consulate of the Sea was written in Barcelona between 1258 and 1266, accepting the influence from Pisa, and he rejecting the arguments that gave an Italian origin to the book.Capmany, p. XII-xxv At the same time, the Sardinian Domenico Azun argues in favor of a Pisan origin, stating that, Pisa as a leading maritime power of the time, should necessarily have their own maritime legislation. French Pardessus, in his study Collection de lois maritimes anterieures au XVIII si√®cle disagrees from Azun, considering that the first copy is not the one written in Latin that he had studied, but the one written in Catalan. He assumes that it was handwritten in Barcelona, but between 1340 and 1400, disagreeing on this point with Capmany. Later, Wildscut, considering that the original compilation makes no reference to the Bills of exchange, he concludes that this Catalan document must predate the first half of the 13th century.Enciclopedia General del Mar. Ediciones Garriga Barcelona (1957)  Influence and impact  The expansion of the Crown of Aragon and its commercial and maritime supremacy meant that the Book of the Consulate of the Sea was respected throughout the Mediterranean and up into the Atlantic. Based originally on the maritime customs of Barcelona and supplemented by the Valencia Consulate of the Sea, the Book of the Consulate of the Sea laid the basis for all subsequent Mediterranean maritime customs. Originally written in Catalan, the Book of the Consulate of the Sea was translated into Italian, French, English, Castilian and other languages, and for centuries was the basis of merchant marine legislation in many countries, even up to modern times. An annex of the book contains Barcelona's ordinances of 1435 on marine insurance. The wide circulation of the book helped spread these ordinances throughout Europe. The Nueva Planta decrees (1707 - 1716) entirely suppressed the Consulates of the Sea in the Crown of Aragon, except in Mallorca and Barcelona. The latter did not usually act in interference with the Bourbon laws. The rules of the Book of the Consulate of the Sea were active in Spain until 1829, when they were replaced by the Spanish code of commerce, inspired by French law. Several European countries continued to use these ordinances until the eighteenth century. In 1874 Sir Travers Twiss translated them into English for reasons of utility, in the early twentieth century a court in the United States denied an action on the grounds of its not being supported by the Consulate of the Sea, and in March 1937 the Court of Appeal of Alexandria quoted a chapter of the book in its judgment.

According to Arcadi Garcia Sanz, it became an adaptation and not a replica. Huguet Borras drafted the Ordre judici√†ria de la Cort dels c√≤nsols del mar de la ciutat de Val√®ncia; (judiciary Order of the Court of consuls Sea of the city of Valencia) and rewrote the Valencian customs, creating a compilation called Cap√≠tols del Consolat de mar de Mallorques (chapters of the Sea Consulate of Mallorca), documented for the first time on 14 February 1345. = Valencian Consulat de Mar 1407 = It is considered the masterpiece of medieval maritime law, and one of the icons of valencian jurisprudence.1407 facsimile of the manuscript The original manuscript is preserved in the Municipal Archives of Valencia.

Customs adapted from Valencia in Mallorca, and from there in Barcelona.Capmany, p. 317-318 Capmany says that because of these adaptation the first seven chapters dealt with matters that were only useful for Valencia Sea consuls, and several laws and ordinances from Barcelona were added indiscriminately, adding that the rest of chapters of the ordinations that form the biggest part of the Book of the Consulate of the Sea was not copied from Mallorca and Valencia, but was compiled thereof from Barcelona customs known as Free Consulate of the Sea and being those Barcelona's customs compiled before the Valencian ordinations by early printers, have caused confusion in later authors, who have given a Valencian origin when in fact they have originated in Barcelona. The first edition came out of print on 14 August 1502.Capmany, p. xxxv Part I consists of 43 chapters that prescribe methods to choose the consuls of the sea and appellate judges in Valencia, the legal responsibilities of each and the procedural regulations of awards of cases brought before them.

The first area of Article 46 to 297, deals with generally accepted customs of maritime trade, while the second area, up to 298 items 334, it deals with the pirates, piracy, armed naval expeditions, convoys, maritime insurance, bills of exchange and other various materials.

Molin√© y Bras√©s edition of 1914  1914 edition of the Book of the Consulate of the Sea, edited by Ernest Molin√© and Brases. One of the most complete editions is due to Molin√© y Bras√©s of 1914, which contains not only the old customs prior to the first compilation but included all subsequent contributions. Contains: * The regulations of the consuls of Sea from Valencia. (1 to 45) * The maritime customs of Barcelona. (46-297) * The arrangements for armed ships that go along armed and leaving the sea. (298-334) * The chronicle of enactments. * Chapters of king Oere Ter√ß.

Compilations in the antiquity  The oldest collection is probably the Babylonian index, from the eighteenth century BC, followed by the \\"Phoenician customs\\" compiled in 2000 BC, that were copied by the Greeks and later by the Romans. The people of Rhodes directly adapted the Phoenician laws. The Greeks have founded a Greek colony in Empuries and kept a constant sea trade with Greece following therefore the \\"Greek costums\\".  Compilations from which originated  The book was inspired distantly from previous compilations, as the Pisan Constitutum usus (1161) and Breve consulum maris (1162) and the Latin text Consuetudo maris of the first half of the 13th century, which has been documented in Catalonia in 1231. In 1010 were codified in Amalfi the Tabula Amalphitana or Tavole Amalfi, followed by the codification of maritime customs of Trani in 1063, which were then adapted by the city of Fermo. In 1243 James I of Aragon has demarcated the Ribera (seaside) of Barcelona and its ordinances were codified in 1258 in the Carta consulatus riparie Barchinone, which had not yet codified the maritime customs of Barcelona itself. Shortly afterwards, Barcelona's municipal boundaries were reorganized and the Ribera (seaside) came under the Consell de Cent, so the Ribera (seaside) lost its autonomy. In the last quarter of the 13th century Barcelona consuls they started naming the great men of the Ribera (seaside), which in 1282 were named \\"consols de mar\\" (\\"consuls of sea\\").  Compilations with its influence  Many authors believe that the laws specified in the Book of the Consulate of the Sea had a big influence on all other compilations of maritime law in Europe, which are partly based on it. Some of these laws specified in the Book of the Consulate of the Sea were already adopted in the ninth century in places like the Baltic, the North Sea, the Schleswig sea: Riga, Wisby, Hamburg, L√ºbeck and other cities of the Hanseatic League, being published since 1407 under the title Waterrecht , also called laws of Wisby. According to some authors the Rules of Ol√©ron were compiled by Edward I of England and expanded and promulgated by Richard I of England on his return from the Holy Land, but others say Eleanor of Aquitaine would have proclaimed them already in 1160. The fact is that the exact origin of these laws is disputed and, given the lack of communication between sailors of the Atlantic and Mediterranean sailors, it is possible the absence of influence between them. However, laws compiled in the Mediterranean eventually surpassed in importance those of the Atlantic and arrived to replace them, as the Mediterranean countries used to have more maritime activity during several centuries. The Black Book of the Admiralty of Britain also dates back to the twelfth century.

Prior to his interest in the field there was little photographic use in advertising and his images have become classic icons. He was a recipient of several awards and he had his own photographic agency in Bombay (now Mumbai), which became well known in Asia. Early life Mitter Bedi was born in Lahore, British India, on 26 January 1926. He studied at the D.A.V. School in Lahore from 1930 to 1940. He relocated to Bombay in 1940 and pursued his college education from the Vidyasagar College in Calcutta from 1940 to 1943. He married Sarla Goenka, and they had three daughters, Preeti, Jyoti, and Gayatri. Career Bedi started his career by working for a printing press and the publicity department of a commercial firm and then took up a job in the film industry in 1947, the year of the partitioning of India and Pakistan into independent nations. At the start of his career in the early 1950s, his photographic assignments covered small events, mostly related to weddings and birthday celebrations or serving as the third or fourth assistant to a Bollywood film director. He frequented the airport to photograph passengers departing and arriving, which prompted his father-in-law B.N. Goenka, an industrialist, to suggest that Bedi change professions or travel abroad. However Bedi was firm in his resolve to continue in his chosen profession and said: \\"I am never going to leave the profession but bring it to the heights it deserves\\". In 1959 his photographic assignments saw a drastic change when he met Arthur D'Arzian, who had specialized in photography of the steel and oil industry, during a social function of the Standard Oil Company in Bombay. Bedi then pursued engagements of Industrial photography, a new field just taking off in the country. Bedi's assignments covered public sector corporations and private enterprises. From 1960 to 1985, he traversed the industrial regions of India taking pictures. He took more than 2,000 photo shoots during the span of his career and covered projects from industries such as steel and oil, hospitality, mines, sugar, pharmaceuticals and many more. To propagate black-and-white photography as a profession in the country he wrote many articles and also established an academy in Bombay which is still operational under the direction of his family members. His photographs depicted a nation in which the factory and reactor dominated over the Indian people. He also worked as visiting professor in: K.C. College of Journalism, Bombay during 1974‚Äì75; National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad in 1976; in Rajednra Prasad Institute of Communication, Bombay in 1978; and in SNDT Women's University, Bombay, 1978. His academy in Bombay was a prominent institution in photography which enrolled national and international students and teachers. Bedi's images have become classic icons of the industrialization which was carried out in India under Nehru. In spite of the limiting aspects of photographs taken primarily for advertising, Bedi introduced shape, design and geometric planes to create artistic rather than simply functional images. His visual expressions and artistry were used by both the state and industrialists to drive national development. An oeuvre of his black-and-white photographs taken during the period 1960s to 1970s, was held at the Piramal Centre for Photography representing an Art Form in Mumbai. Bedi died in Bombay on 11 March 1985 due to a cardiac failure. Awards Bedi's career achievements received acclaim through several awards. Some of the awards he received were: Two Kodak International Awards; nine Advertising Club Awards; and six Commercial Artists Guild (CAG) Awards. In 1984 he was honoured with CAG's \\"Photographer of the Year\\" award. Appreciation Writing in The Hindu, Ranjit Hoskote observed: .

The longest axis of the island lies in a north-south direction. It is approximately 24 kilometres long and just over 3 kilometres at its widest point. Long Island along with Merasheen Island and Red Island make up the majority of the islands in Placentia Bay. Long Island is located approximately 22 kilometres northwest of Argentia. It is separated from Merasheen Island to the west by a 24 kilometre long channel that narrows to within 2.12 kilometres. Red Island is approximately 10 kilometres to the southwest of Long Island. Geography It is currently an uninhabited island except for occasional visitors to resettled communities. The island had a number of communities which are all currently resettled. The communities were, Peaches Cove, Spencers Cove, Haystack, Kingwell, Port Royal (originally Mussell Harbour), Harbour Buffett and Coffin Cove.. The name Long Island is used to describe many islands in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador; there are at least 19 other islands that share the same name. The mainstay of the economy of the settlements of Long Island was the fishery. The many coves and inlets that dotted its shores were given names of the early English and Irish settlers, names like Collett Cove, Hay Cove and Hennessey Cove, Kearney Head, Dicks Island and Isaac Island. The names of some of the uninhabited islands near Long Island were given characteristic names such as Bread and Cheese Islands to the north, Great Seal Island and Iron Island to the south, Dog Island off the eastern coast, and Barren Island to the west. History The largest settlement on Long Island was Harbour Buffett, located on the southern end of the island. It was the main centre for supplies and the location of fish merchants. There were no roads on Long Island and most of the communities were connected by paths. The communities on the northern end of the island; Spencers Cove, Haystack and Peaches Cove was separated by a 16 kilometre long path through wilderness to Harbour Buffett. Merchants operating out of Harbour Buffett in the 1800s and 1900s were James Chambers, Thomas Hann and Freeman Wareham. Alberto Wareham operated an enterprise from Spencers Cove. The residents of Spencers Cove and Harbour Buffett were amongst the last settlements to resettle under the controversial resettlement program of the 1960s and 1970s. By the 1970s the entire population of the island had resettled to towns and villages on the mainland portions along Placentia Bay. The island then had reverted to its former role as a summer fishing base.

At the age of 21, Russak-Aminoach began her M.B.A. studies at Tel Aviv University, specializing in Finance, while lecturing at the university's Accounting Faculty at the same time. Again, she graduated with honors (cum laude) and later on completed her LLB at Tel Aviv University. Between the ages of 24-26, Russak-Aminoach served in the Israel Defense Forces as a lecturer in the IDF Command & Staff College, where she taught Operations Research and Project Management. Career Between 1992 and 1994, Russak-Aminoach served as personal assistant to Galia Maor, then Deputy CEO of Bank Leumi le-Israel. In 1995, she became a partner at Somekh-Chaikin CPA firm (KPMG Israel). Five years later, in August 2000, she was appointed CEO of the firm. In January 2004, at the age of 38, Russak- Aminoach was appointed Head of the Corporate Division of Bank Leumi, becoming the youngest Management Member in the history of the Bank.

Six years after her appointment, Leumi has established itself as the leading bank in Israel in terms of profits, market cap and innovation. To reach this landmark, Russak- Aminoach has led a turnaround within the Leumi Group, focusing on digital transformation and enhancing efficiency. These steps included an extensive streamlining program across the Group, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 20% in the Group's workforce, merging of branches and business lines, exiting the Bank's global private banking operations. All this led to a significant decrease in the Bank's total expenses. In addition, Russak-Aminoach led major steps to improve the Bank's capital adequacy. During this period, Leumi attained a credit portfolio with minimal credit loss expenses, one of the best of its kind. During Russak- Aminoach tenure the bank received certain alleviations throughout the US tax evasion investigation because of the complete cooperation it demonstrated, concluding the investigation already at the end of 2014. In comparison, Poalim bank paid the regulators massive amount of $500 million more than Leumi, and the total difference of $750 million (including consultants‚Äô fee) was due to the US regulators‚Äô realization that Poalim is buying time and does not cooperate fully with them.https://www.themarker.com/markets/.premium-1.8817476 In May 2014, Russak-Aminoach decided to significantly expand Leumi's high-tech banking operations with the establishment of LeumiTech, the Group's high-tech banking arm, which provides tailor-made financial services to Israeli high- tech companies operating around the globe.

Since Russak-Aminoach took office as CEO, and until the end of the third quarter of 2018, Leumi's share price has more than doubled. In January 2018, Russak-Aminoach led a strategic investment into Bank Leumi USA, a fully owned subsidiary of the Leumi Group, with the sale of 15% of Bank Leumi USA to Endicott Capital Management and MSD Capital L.P. The agreement reflected a net worth value of approximately USD 1 billion for Bank Leumi USA, 20% above its equity capital. Six months later, Russak-Aminoach promoted an agreement with US private equity fund Warburg Pincus for the sale of Leumi Card, Leumi Group's credit card subsidiary, for NIS 2.5 billion, 30% above its equity capital. The agreement positioned Leumi as the first bank in Israel to implement the recommendations of the Government Committee for Increasing Competition in the Banking Industry (\\"The Strum Committee\\"). In July 2019, she announced that she was stepping down as CEO. = Digital Banking = Russak Aminoach is considered a pioneer in the global digital banking arena.
