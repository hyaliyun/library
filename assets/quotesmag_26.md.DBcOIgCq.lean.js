It was built in 1922 by architect Leonard F. Starks to house the offices and printery for The Fresno Bee newspaper.\\"Fresno Bee Building (1922)\\". A Guide to Historic Architecture in Fresno, California. Retrieved 2014-01-18. The building underwent numerous modifications, the natural consequence of growth and changes in the newspaper and printing industries. The 1922 structure remained virtually original until 1936 when an addition was constructed to accommodate an enlarged engraving department and studio space for radio station KMJ. Designed by Fresno architectural firm Franklin and Kump, the four-floor addition was connected to the building at the south elevation. The most significant modification came in 1951, when a new entrance wing and pressroom were designed by Lockwood Greene and Dunbar Beck. The newspaper relocated in 1975 leaving the building abandoned for many years. From 1981 to 1984, members of the community raised more than $5.5 million to open the Fresno Metropolitan Museum inside the building. The Museum opened its doors on April 8, 1984. In August 2005, the museum began an extensive interior renovation. The museum reopened on November 13, 2008. The $28 million renovation project brought the historic building into the 21st century with more accessible gallery space, new restroom facilities and elevators, and remodeled fourth and fifth floors. The building underwent significant structural enhancements, specifically on the west wall from the footings below the basement up to the fifth floor. The existing support columns consisting of steel reinforced concrete were enhanced in the basement and first floor. On January 5, 2010, the museum closed due to its inability to pay off the increasing deficit from the renovation and operations. The City of Fresno became the new owners of the building. The Fresno Bee building sat vacant until April 13, 2012, when the Community Media Access Collaborative (CMAC) located its public, educational, and government access television station on the second floor. CMAC constructed a 900 square foot television studio in the former museum's main exhibit space which extends into the third floor, and created classroom and office spaces. As of February 2018, the fifth and a portion of the first floor are occupied by the Fresno Football Club. Facade.

It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1974 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It was designed in 1879, but construction did not begin until 1904. As of 2014, it houses the Antrim County courts and prosecuting attorney. History Antrim County was first laid out in 1840, although the first known settler did not arrive until 1846, when Abram S. Wadsworth began living near the location of what is now the Elk Rapids Township Hall. By 1860, there were still fewer than 150 people living in the county. However, Elk Rapids, the oldest settlement, was selected as the county seat, and in 1866 a small wooden courthouse was built there. However, the county was quickly growing, and there was a push to move the county seat from Elk Rapids, which was located in one corner of the county, to a more central location. In 1879, in a close vote of the county populace, it was decided to move the county seat; the village of Bellaire was platted that same year. Land for the courthouse square was purchased, and a courthouse was designed by Traverse City architect Jens C. Peterson. However, the close vote spurred legal challenges, and the county seat selection was appealed all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court. This, and other related legal wrangling, delayed construction for 25 years. Temporary facilities in Bellaire were used until that time. The county seat choice was eventually finalized after another vote, and this courthouse was built from Peterson's original plans by the firm of Waterman and Price in 1904‚Äì1905 at a cost of $30,000. A clock, manufactured by the E. Howard Company of Boston, was installed in 1921. A bell manufactured by the E. VanDuzen Company of Cincinnati was installed in 1922. In 1977, a new courthouse was constructed to meet the growing needs of the community, and county offices moved the next year. There was some discussion of what to do with the 1905 courthouse, and it stood empty for 12 years. but in 1990, county voters approved $2.2 million for renovations. The county courts and prosecuting attorney took up residence in 1992. Description The Antrim County Courthouse is a rectangular, -story, Late Victorian-eclectic, red-brick structure on a gray sandstone foundation with a hip roof and gray sandstone trim. The galvanized steel cornice has been painted and sanded to match the stone trim. A clock tower, over high, projects from the roof; a clock dial of in diameter is located at the top.

The IMS provides a center for holistic research and analysis of the Mediterranean Area, as well as academic teaching on the region. The IMS‚Äôs objectives are: fostering the establishment of Mediterranean Studies in the European and Middle-Eastern Research Areas, publishing scholarly literature on the Mediterranean, and establishing collaborative networks of researchers, academics and Mediterranean organizations across the world by organizing international conferences, seminars and ongoing global collaborations. History While the area studies known as ‚ÄúMediterranean Studies‚Äù have been established in France, Spain and the United Kingdom since the 1990s, the Mediterranean area has largely been regarded in Korea as a place for tourism rather than an academic subject. Furthermore, while there are many research institutes and university departments in Korea working on Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, an Institute considering the entire Mediterranean region has been missing, creating a need to inaugurate a tradition of studying the Mediterranean area as an academic entity. The IMS was founded in 1997 as the result of an initiative to establish an interdisciplinary research-intensive institute dedicated to the fields of the Mediterranean Studies in Korea. It is situated within Busan University of Foreign Studies (BUFS) and is currently the only research organization of its kind in Korea. During the course of a history spanning almost two decades, the IMS has been successful in attracting external funding for specific research projects, most notably from the Ministry of Education in Korea for its groundbreaking Humanities Korea (HK) project, as well as pursuing joint projects with other similar specialized centers. The campus overview of Busan University of Foreign Studies.The IMS produces outputs that are multifaceted and interdisciplinary. 1. In the field of academic research, it has published background analysis, professional publications, and socio-scientific publications including the Mediterranean Humanities Series. It also publishes an international Mediterranean Review (in English) and a domestic Mediterranean Area Studies, two scholarly journals dealing with the history, culture, environment, economy, politics and societies of the Mediterranean. 2. In the field of academic teaching, it provides university seminars and lectures both on site at BUFS and overseas. 3. Finally, in the field of academic exchange, the Institute holds international conferences, lectures, public panel debates, and workshops in cooperation with a wide range of universities and research institutes in the Mediterranean Area and beyond. The IMS intends to contribute towards further establishing Mediterranean Studies beyond its frontiers of native Korea, and to link this research focus with established institutes working on Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, or the Western and Arab world in general.Institute for Mediterranean Studies (2007), Annex of the Institute for Mediterranean Studies. IMS and HK [Humanities Korea] project The IMS is currently supported and funded by the Humanities Korea (HK) Project of the Korea Research Foundation (KRF), a public organization operating under the Ministry of Education in Korea.

It should be distinguished from the concept of d√©rogeance (\\"derogation\\" of nobility), which, e.g., in the context of French history, led to removal of the privileges of nobility, but not necessarily the right for nobility itself. In particular, the nobility of descendants was not automatically lost.\\"Derogeance\\" , Dictionnaire encyclop√©dique de la noblesse de France, Nicolas Viton de Saint-Allais, Paris, 1816 Nobility could be restored by the King's Letter of Rehabilitation (Lettre de r√©habilitation). Since nobility was exempted from taxes, especially the taille, many usurped the appearances of nobility, and this usurpation could continue across generations. Therefore, in France there was a special establishment \\"Grand Inquiry into Nobility\\" Grande enqu√™te sur la noblesse, which was in force during 1666‚Äì1727. This was accompanied by various edicts which declared certain elements of the outfit (heraldry, armaments, decorations, etc.) to be permitted only for nobility. Revocation of usurped nobility was accompanied with heavy fines. In addition to real usurpation, inquiries were made into hereditary nobility: unless the nobility was given by a Letter of Ennoblement, according to Grande enqu√™te one had to prove that at least four generations of his ancestors enjoyed the noble status.Voir Ch√©rin, \\"Abr√©g√© chronologie d‚Äô√©dits, d√©clarations, r√®glements, arr√™ts et lettres patentes des rois de France concernant la noblesse\\", in : Pierre Loizeau de Grandmaison, Dictionnaire h√©raldique, Paris Abb√© Migne Publ., 1861, \\"Contested Spaces of Nobility in Early Modern Europe\\", Matthew P.

John Hatfield Early life Born at Mottram in Longendale, Cheshire, before 1759, Hatfield became traveller to a linendraper in the North of England about 1772, and paid his addresses to a natural daughter of Lord Robert Manners, who was to receive a dowry if she married with her father's approval. Lord Robert, taken in by Hatfield, assented to his proposal of marriage, and presented him at his wedding with ¬£1,500. Hatfield soon went to London, described himself as a near relation of the Rutland family, and lived in luxury. When the money was spent he disappeared, abandoning his wife (who shortly died) and three daughters. Debtor and second marriage After several years' absence Hatfield returned to London in 1782. His career was cut short by his committal to the King's Bench prison for debt. Here he induced a clergyman to lay his case before the Duke of Rutland, who secured his release. When the duke became lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1784, Hatfield went to Dublin, and by claiming relationship with the viceroy lived for a time on credit. He was soon committed to The Marshalsea, Dublin, when the duke again paid his debts and sent him out of the country. Hatfield continued a career of imposture until arrested for an hotel bill at Scarborough on 25 April 1792. He remained in the Scarborough gaol for more than seven years, but eventually managed to excite the pity of Miss Nation, a Devonshire lady, who lived with her mother in a house opposite the prison. She paid his debts, and, though she is said never to have spoken to him till he left the gaol, married him next morning (14 September 1800). The pair went to Dulverton in Somersetshire, where by fraudulent representations Hatfield obtained both money and credit. He lived in London once again in magnificent style, and canvassed : Members of Parliament had immunity from arrest. Pressed by his creditors, he procured a few hundred pounds and disappeared, leaving his second wife and her young child in Somerset. Third marriage In August 1801 Hatfield arrived at Keswick, Cumberland, in a carriage, and impersonated Alexander Augustus Hope, M.P. He spent his time in excursions, and on a visit to Grasmere became acquainted with a Liverpool gentleman named Crump, whose name and credit he then employed when in want of money. By franking letters in his assumed name he silenced suspicion. An intrigue with a lady of fortune came to nothing. But the reputation of Mary Robinson, the \\"Buttermere Beauty\\", led him to visit the Fish Inn, Buttermere, where her father was landlord. She was sufficiently well known to be mentioned in a guide book of 1792, by Joseph Palmer.bbc.co.uk, Putting beauty on the map: A new breed of tourist. Finding that Mary's family had some means, Hatfield married her at Lorton Church on 2 October 1802. Newspapers reported the marriage of the \\"Buttermere Beauty\\" to a member of the aristocracy, and the Earl of Hopetoun, the head of the Hope family, made it known that the real Colonel Hope was then in Vienna. After his wedding Hatfield set out for Scotland, but in four or five days returned with Mary to her father's house. George Hardinge, a judge in Wales, who knew Colonel Hope, went to Keswick, and invited Hatfield to visit him; Hatfield was introduced to Hardinge by one of his creditors. Hatfield then asserted that his name was Hope, but that he was not the member for Linlithgow. A warrant was made out, and he was placed in custody. Hatfield treated the matter as a mistake, and managed to escape from his custodians. In November a reward of ¬£50 was offered for his apprehension, and a description was circulated. Arrest, trial and execution Hatfield was taken at a village sixteen miles from Swansea soon after. His trial took place at Carlisle on 15 August 1803. To three indictments for forgery Hatfield pleaded not guilty. But the charges were fully proved. He was sentenced to be hanged, and met his death coolly, on Saturday, 13 September. Mary Robinson and her false lover were the subject at the time of novels, verses, dramas, and tales. At the time, Samuel Taylor Coleridge gave wide publicity to the elopement of John and Mary, in five articles for The Morning Post. Coleridge also visited Hatfield as a condemned man, while travelling through Carlisle with Dorothy Wordsworth and William Wordsworth.

It gave an early role to Donna Reed although Mickey Rooney had lobbied for his then-wife Ava Gardner to have her part. Within a few months of the film's release, she filed for divorce.The Courtship of Andy Hardy article at TCMDB This was the 12th entry in the long-running Andy Hardy series of sixteen. Plot summary When Carvel teenager and new tow truck-owner Andy Hardy is stopped by a policeman for driving without a license plate, a radio report implicates him in stealing the car he is towing. At home, Andy finds it hard to be cheerful, even though his mother Emily, his father, Judge James K. Hardy, and his aunt Milly are celebrating his sister Marian's return from New York. Marian thinks that Carvel is too unsophisticated for her and is annoyed by her family's worries that she is dating Jeff Willis, a local young man who is considered a \\"wolf.\\" As the judge sits in his study, Andy comes in and tells him about the misunderstanding that led to the auto theft problem. The judge promises to sort things out if Andy will help him by befriending Melodie Nesbit, a teenager at the center of a custody battle between her mother Olivia and her father Roderick. Although Melodie is not as pretty or outgoing as Andy's other girl friends, he agrees to help by asking her to a dance. Jeff arrives, announcing his presence on a loudspeaker set up in his car, and broadcasts his invitation to Marian to come with him to the Red Door Inn on the 19th. Andy tells her about the notorious inn and warns her not to get involved in a scandal. On the night of the dance, Melodie is happy to be there, even though she knows that Andy has only asked her out because of his father. Andy has to bribe his friends to dance with her, but one boy, Harry Land, refuses the money because he has a secret crush on Melodie. After the dance, Melodie, who has a crush on Andy, asks his advice on how to appeal to boys. The same night, Emily secretly orders a forty dollar cut-away coat for her husband out of her household account. A few days later, Andy's friend Susie comes to distribute posters for a \\"spinster skip\\" dance, to which the girls are to invite the boys. Andy offers to drive Susie around town and is seen by Melodie, who immediately goes to the judge and asks him to say that he accepted her invitation for Andy to come to the dance. At the same time, the postman arrives with Emily's COD coat and informs her that the amount due is $61.40. Emily is upset because the ad said nothing about extra charges and refuses to accept the package. On the night of Marian's date with Jeff, she becomes annoyed when her family makes fun of her choice of a dress, which is really a fancy nightgown, and promises that she \\"will show them.\\" That night, a man from a collection agency comes to the house and demands that Emily pay the full amount of the coat or be taken to court and have her husband's salary attached. Later, at the dance, Melodie impresses everyone with her new clothes and hairstyle, and now the boys are willing to pay Andy. Despite Melodie's charm, Andy later admits to her that he does not return her affection. When she quietly goes into her house, she overhears her parents having a vicious argument. Back at home, Andy feels terrible that he made Melodie cry, but is happy to hear that Polly Benedict, his old girlfriend, is coming home. Melodie then comes to the judge and says that she never wants to see either of her parents again and the judge lets her spend the night with his family. Some time later, Andy, who volunteered to search for the long-overdue Marian, brings her home, towing Jeff's car, in which a drunken Jeff had a minor crash. After they bring the passed-out Jeff into the house, the judge explains to Andy how low man falls when he allows himself to reach this state. The next day, a sober Jeff comes to the door to apologize and say that he did hear the judge's words the previous night and has learned his lesson. That afternoon, the judge meets with Melodie's parents, and after lecturing them about their behavior, asks Melodie in and convinces Olivia and Roderick to retract the horrible things they have said about each other and try to get along. After the family leaves, a tearful Emily comes to her husband, remorseful over what has happened about the cut-away coat. The judge alleviates her fears by letting her know that he inadvertently found out about the agency and discovered that the entire mail-order business was run by confidence men who tricked unsuspecting customers into paying more than the advertised price for the suit. That afternoon, Andy takes Harry to see Melodie, who has gotten over her crush on Andy and is more than willing to date the smitten Harry. She also convinces Andy to ask Polly to the football dance. As Andy leaves Melodie's house, Polly drives by with her cousin, who coincidentally is the man who mistakenly thought that Andy stole his car. With everything now fine, Andy drives home and tells his father, \\"women are habit forming.\\" Cast * Lewis Stone as Judge James K.

Each term the committee selects a variety of films, often world cinema or art films, and screening is free to PSU students. The cinema is open to the public for a nominal fee. History The cinema opened in October 1970, under the name Cine-Mini Theater in rented space formerly used by the Portland State University Bookstore. Larry Moyer, owner of Moyer Theaters and rival brother of Tom Moyer, believed that Portland was ready for an intimate, fully automated niche market movie house where the projector, house music, curtains, and house lights were automatically controlled. The small theater was not a profitable first-run venue, however, and soon it began showing old movies and midnight movies, including the first public screening of \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" in 1975. The name was changed to 5th Avenue Cinema in 1973, although the entrance remained on Southwest Hall Street. Almost from the beginning, the cinema worked with the PSU Film Committee to select programming that would appeal to students. An alliance with the Northwest Film Study Center followed, and the cinema even screened films during the annual Portland International Film Festival. When Act III Cinemas purchased Moyer Theaters in the late 1980s, Portland State University accepted ownership of the 5th Avenue Cinema as a non-profit organization. The cinema is one of the few student operated theaters in the United States.

Also known as Bhukhel (‡§≠‡•Å‡§ñ‡•á‡§≤), it is famed for the Buddhist Samyak festival held here. The field is one of the city's landmarks and the hallowed venue of Samyak, a spectacular celebration when hundreds of images of Dƒ´pankara Buddha are assembled for an alms-giving ceremony. Bhuikhel's area has shrunk over the years due to construction on its edges. Religious significance Bhuikhel is of sacred significance because it is the site of the Samyak ceremony of Kathmandu. This alms-giving festival is held in all the three cities of the Kathmandu Valley at differing intervals. In Bhaktapur, Samyak is celebrated annually, in Patan it occurs every five years, and in Kathmandu it takes place once every 12 years. The most recent one was held in 2005. Samyak celebrates the practice of giving to the Buddhas and monks in the Newar Buddhist tradition. The festival in Kathmandu is observed for three days. On the first day, large images of Dipankar Buddha are brought out of sacred courtyards and private homes and displayed in a row at Kathmandu Durbar Square to receive offerings from devotees. On the second day, the statues are carried in procession to Bhuikhel and assembled on the field. During the main ceremony attended by the head of state, priests receive alms consisting of different kinds of sacred foods. The third day is known as MisƒÅ Samyak, which means Women's Samyak. On this day, the image of Goddess AjimƒÅ Dyah is brought down from her shrine at Swayambhu for the ceremony. Historical references This was the place where British traveller Colonel William Kirkpatrick set up his camp when he visited Kathmandu in 1793 as the envoy of Charles Cornwallis, the governor-general of British India.

Eichhorst was an official in the American Football League, moving to the National Football League in 1970, the first season following the NFL-AFL merger. He resigned from the NFL at the conclusion of the 1970 campaign to concentrate on his career as a college basketball official, where he would carve out a lengthy and distinguished tenure officiating in the Big Eight and Missouri Valley conferences. Eichhorst was the line judge on the crew of referee Bernie Ulman and wore uniform number 77 during his lone NFL season. His number and position were filled by Don Orr for 1971, although a shuffling of crew assignments moved Tommy Hensley to Ulman's crew as line judge in 1971, with Orr joining the crew of John McDonough. Eichhorst's number 77 was later worn by Mike Pereira, who served as the NFL's vice president of officiating from 2001‚Äì10 and is now a commentator for the NFL on FOX; and Terry McAulay, who served as referee for Super Bowl XXXIX, Super Bowl XLIII, and Super Bowl XLVIII. Rich is married to Barbara Eichhorst, and they have 4 kids; Linda, Laura, Lisa and Leigh Ann, and 7 grandkids; Molly, Marguerite, Mary, Benjamin, Jacob, Anna, and Olivia.

He transitioned from diplomacy to football as a result of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where he was Diplomatic Advisor and Chief of Protocol of the French organizing committee. He then joined FIFA where he successively held the positions of international adviser to the President (1999‚Äì2002), Deputy Secretary General (2002‚Äì05), Delegate of the President (2005‚Äì07) and finally Director of International Relations (2007‚Äì10) during the terms of President Sepp Blatter. He left FIFA in 2010 and became football commissioner for the World Festival of Black Arts in Dakar (2010) and an adviser to the Palestinian Football Federation (PFA) and the Palestine Olympic Committee (POC), the Football Federation of Kosovo, the Cyprus Turkish Football Federation (CTFA) and finally the Congolese football club TP Mazembe of Lubumbashi. Champagne was twice a candidate to replace Blatter in FIFA's presidency elections of 2015 and 2016. However, each time he failed to secure enough support.  Youth and education  J√©r√¥me Champagne was educated at the Lyc√©e d'Arsonval in Saint- Maur-des-Foss√©s(France) before entering in 1978 at the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences-Po) where he graduated in 1981 as well as at the Ecole Nationale des Langues et Civilisations Orientales (INALCO) . Eligible for the √âcole nationale d'administration in 1982, he joined thereafter the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs (France) with the rank of Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Between 1976 and 1983, he was a freelancer for France Football where he wrote in \\"foreign pages\\" under the direction of :fr:Jacques Ferran, :fr:Jean‚ÄìPhilippe Rethacker and :fr:Jacques Thibert. Since childhood, Champagne has been a strong supporter of AS Saint-√âtienne. He is married and has three children.  Career = Diplomatic career = Councilor of Foreign Affairs  In 1983, J√©r√¥me Champagne began a diplomatic career as Secretary of Foreign Affairs. From 1983 to 1997, he was successively cultural and technical cooperation attach√© with the Embassy of France in Oman (1983‚Äì1984), the third secretary at the Embassy of France in Cuba (1985‚Äì1987), technical advisor to the Department of Economic Affairs ‚Äì section High Technologies ‚Äì at the Quai d'Orsay (1987‚Äì1991), Deputy Consul General at the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles (1991‚Äì1995) and First Secretary in charge of domestic policy at the Embassy of France in Brazil (1995‚Äì1997) where he received the National Order of the Southern Cross from the hands of Extraordinary Sports Minister at the time, Pel√©.  Diplomatic Advisor and Chief of Protocol of the CFO/LOC France 1998  While he was Deputy Consul General in Los Angeles, Jerome Champagne met the leaders of the organizing committee of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the Co-Chairs Fernand Sastre and Michel Platini and General Manager :fr:Jacques Lambert. On behalf of the French Organizing Committee (CFO) and the Consulate General of France in Los Angeles, He organized the Bastille Day ceremony on July 14, 1994 in Los Angeles, three days before the final of the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the theme of which was the promotion of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. In 1997, Champagne became diplomatic adviser and Chief of Protocol of the French Organizing Committee (CFO) of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. During that competition Champagne met Blatter, then Secretary General of FIFA and the candidate to succeed Jo√£o Havelange. Upon Blatter's election to the head of the institution in June 1998, he appointed Champagne as an international adviser, and Michel Platini as football adviser of the new President of the FIFA.\\"Top 100 Movers & Shakers\\", World Soccer, May 2008, p.36 = FIFA career = During the eleven years spent in FIFA, Champagne followed sport-political issues, relations with FIFA member associations as well as specific projects such as the FIFA Centennial, FIFA's relations with governments and the European Union including the defense of the specificity of sport at the EU, the Win in Africa with Africa initiative, FIFA's support for Palestinian football, the improvements in FIFA's relationship with FIFPro for the good of the governance of world football, the development of CIES Football Observatory, and FIFA's relations with the International Olympic Committee and other international federations.Press release from FIFA, January 15, 2010, signed by Nicolas Maingot He is also credited for having contributed to the reelection of President Sepp Blatter in 2002, supported the latter during the choice of South Africa in May 2004 for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and worked behind the scenes for the election in January 2007 of Michel Platini as President of UEFA. In terms of football development, he was responsible in 2006 of the \\"Win in Africa with Africa\\" program, whose idea emerged after a meeting in 2005 between the President of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki and Sepp Blatter so that the whole continent would benefit from the first FIFA World Cup held in Africa. With a budget of $70 million voted in the FIFA Congress in Munich in 2006, this program will enable the construction of more than fifty synthetic fields, the computerization of players‚Äô registration, the reorganization of the formats of many local leagues and the establishment of sports management courses in Egypt, Senegal and South Africa. In addition, Champagne has led several draws for FIFA competitions including the draw in December 2003 of the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification Champagne had been suggested as a potential replacement for Blatter, and in September 2014 he declared he would run for the FIFA presidency at its 2015 election. In January 2015, he declared he would run a clean campaign and would consider taking the 2022 World Cup away from Qatar if he won the election. However, he failed to obtain enough support, and withdrew his candidacy in February 2015. In October 2015 he declared himself a candidate for the 2016 election for the presidency following the corruption investigation and Blatter's suspension, but again failed, only gaining seven votes in the election. = Consultant for international football = In 2010, Champagne leaves his position as director of international relations of FIFA. He explained his departure in describing himself as a \\"political fuse\\". He then practiced as a consultant in international football individually and within the agency Football Future. Appointed Adviser to Palestinian Football Association in 2010, he works with its president, Jibril Rajoub for the creation of a professional league, the development of women's football and the organization at home in 2011, the first time in history, of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC) (against Afghanistan) and to the football tournament of the Olympic Games (against Thailand). He plays an active role in the rapprochement between the two Palestinian and Israeli National Olympic Committees led by the International Olympic Committee after the visit to the region of Jacques Rogge in October 2010 and also in the negotiations conducted by FIFA President Sepp Blatter in 2013 for the establishment of a mediation mechanism between FIFA, the Palestinian Football Association and Israel Football Association. Since 2011, he advises the Football Federation of Kosovo in its quest for international recognition. In 2011, he became adviser to the Congolese club TP Mazembe (TPM), chaired since 1998 by Mo√Øse Katumbi Chapwe. His mission is to work for the internationalization of the club and to help the club to become a model on the African continent. In the summer of 2013, Jean-Marc Adjovi-Bocco, a former professional RC Lens and captain of Benin national football team, \\"The Squirrels of Benin \\", he leads a consulting mission on behalf of the Government of Benin for the definition of a \\"modernization strategy\\" for local football. Since autumn 2012, Champagne also plays a leading role in the rapprochement between the Greek Cyprus Football Association and Cyprus Turkish Football Federation. He contributes to the signing on November 5, 2013 in Zurich, of the first agreement since 1955 between the two football associations for a reunification.  Ideas and key positions  Champagne is considered in the world of football as a reformist. He has denounced the effects of individualism and short-termism on football: Thus he addressed himself in 2012 to all 209 football federations through a 26-page document entitled \\"Which FIFA for the 21st century?\\". He explains his approach as \\"rather than a top-down approach, it is necessary to start from football and to be aware of these central issues to define what needs to be achieved and to determine what FIFA could become in the twenty-first century.\\" = \\"The 7 Governance Challenges for the 21st Century\\" = J√©r√¥me Champagne identifies seven challenges for tomorrow‚Äôs football. # The imbalance between amateur football and professional football # The balance between club football and national team football # The divide between the European football and football around the world # The precarious relationship between players and clubs # The relationship of football with money between the need of it and the dangers of its excesses # The autonomy of football from political power # The excesses of economic deregulation in the economy of football According to him, these substantive changes have produced \\"few winners but also many losers\\". = \\"The 11 concrete proposals\\" = According to Champagne, the debate on the future of FIFA should be around four axes: a global football governance dominated by a proactive FIFA, the repositioning football associations in the heart of decision-making process, a fairer distribution of revenues to compensate football existing inequalities and ultimately a governance based on modernity, transparency, democratic debate and ethics. Taking into account these four axes, Champagne has outlined 11 concrete proposals in order to reform FIFA. # Revive the democratic debate within football pyramid # Increase even more development programs with new solidarity mechanisms # Involve leagues, clubs and players in the decision-making process # Restore the role and the centrality of the FAs while clarifying the relations with the confederations # Adjust FIFA to the evolutions of today‚Äôs world to reflect them better # Reshuffle the power responsibilities between the FIFA President, the Executive Committee and the Associations # Strengthen FIFA‚Äôs governance structures # Reform FIFA‚Äôs administration # Modify the insulation of refereeing debates # Define and implement a more comprehensive notion of autonomy # Reconnect FIFA with the \\"people of football\\" Although he is favorable that the powers of the football associations be expanded, Champagne also suggests broadening the FIFA Executive Committee from 24 members to 31 members. It would include the president of the players union, FIFPro, and a representative of the clubs and of the leagues. Other additional seats would be allocated to areas in Africa, Asia, North America and Central America- Caribbean, South America and a seat reserved for women's football. In his many public interventions, he is committed to the rebalancing of power between those involved in football but also between continents, and adapting FIFA to the changes of the 21st century (ethics and transparency requirement, role of new technologies including a modernized refereeing) and a stronger proactive approach in correcting imbalances football between continents, countries and clubs.

It is native to tropical and subtropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Description Pocillopora verrucosa is a colonial coral and grows into hemispherical clumps up to in diameter. The branches are thick and usually have clubbed tips. The surface is covered with large verrucae (wart- like growths) up to high and the corallites (the stony cups from which the polyps emerge) are in diameter. The colour of this coral varies and it may be yellowish-green, pink, brown or bluish-brown. It differs from Pocillopora damicornis in having broader, somewhat flattened, club-tipped branches and by the fact that its verrucae are more evenly sized and spaced. Distribution and habitat Pocillopora verrucosa is native to the tropical and subtropical parts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Its wide range extends from East Africa and the Red Sea to Japan, Indonesia, Australia, Hawaii, Easter Island and the western coast of Central America. It is found at depths down to about but is most common between . It is a common species in most of its range and is found on fringing reefs and moderately-exposed reef fronts but is less tolerant than P. damicornis of sediment and is therefore less common in lagoons. Biology Pocillopora verrucosa, like many corals, contains microscopic symbiotic dinoflagellate algae (zooxanthellae) living within its tissues. Through photosynthesis, these algae produce energy-rich molecules that the coral can assimilate. It has been found that these algae are already present in the eggs before spawning. Pocillopora verrucosa can reproduce by fragmentation, a form of asexual reproduction. It is also a simultaneous hermaphrodite but its reproductive method varies across its range. Each polyp usually contains twelve gonads, the six nearest the mouth being ovaries and the other six spermaries. In South Africa the gametes are released simultaneously from both of these and spawning takes place at new moon in January (mid-summer) with the gametes being liberated into the water column. However, at Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, this species has been shown to fertilise the eggs internally and brood the developing planula larvae. Ecology A number of predators feed on this coral. These include pufferfishes, parrotfishes and filefishes which feed on the tips of the branches and hermit crabs which scrape the skeletal tissue. Other animals feed on the soft tissues while leaving the skeleton intact including the butterflyfishes, the angelfishes and the damselfish, Stegastes acapulcoensis. Invertebrates which feed on this coral are the crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), Jenner's cowry (Jenneria pustulata), the sea urchin, Eucidaris galapagensis and the coral snails, Coralliophila spp.. Both the starfish and the cowry can kill a mature coral colony by stripping off the living tissue. Pocillopora spp. have several mutualistic symbionts including the crab, Trapezia sp., and certain snapping shrimps which protect it from attack by its major predator, the crown-of-thorns starfish. Status Pocillopora verrucosa skeleton In general coral reefs around the world are being destroyed and although this coral is common and relatively resilient, it is likely that populations are in decline along with their habitat. The main threats are climate change, ocean acidification, bleaching and coral diseases. The IUCN has listed Pocillopora verrucosa as being of \\"Least Concern\\" as it considers that the rate of decline in its populations is not sufficient to justify listing it in a more threatened category. Like all corals, it is listed on CITES Appendix II.

Plot A policeman is alerted to a pair of female legs protruding from the surface of a pond. He attempts to rescue the woman, but discovers that the legs are fake, with a sign saying \\"RATS\\" at the bottom. He then falls in the lake himself. Production Diving Lucy was filmed at the boating lake in Queen's Park, Blackburn. Reception The film was the most successful Mitchell & Kenyon film. A reviewer in The Talking Machine News described it as a \\"decided novelty\\", concluding \\"we do not remember seeing anything similar before\\". It was also released in America in February 1904, where the Biograph Company advertised it as \\"the biggest English comedy hit of the year\\". Alongside Bio-graph, the film was also distributed by the Edison Manufacturing Company. Legacy The popularity of Diving Lucy prompted director Frank Mottershaw to copy the film's premise in a 1907 production entitled Sold Again. In this version, the policeman is not explicitly portrayed as the victim of a practical joke, and the film ends with him being hit by snowballs, rather than falling into the water himself. A copy of the film survives in the Cinema Museum in London, along with 64 other Mitchell & Kenyon fiction films.

M. (1948). A mathematical model illustrating the theory of turbulence. In Advances in applied mechanics (Vol. 1, pp. 171-199). Elsevier. The Burgers vortex describes a stationary, self-similar flow. An inward, radial flow, tends to concentrate vorticity in a narrow column around the symmetry axis. At the same time, viscous diffusion tends to spread the vorticity. The stationary Burgers vortex arises when the two effects balance. The Burgers vortex, apart from serving as an illustration of the vortex stretching mechanism, may describe such flows as tornados, where the vorticity is provided by continuous convection-driven vortex stretching.  Flow field  The flow for the Burgers vortex is described in cylindrical (r,\\\\theta,z) coordinates. Assuming axial symmetry (no \\\\theta-dependence), the flow field associated with the axisymmetric stagnation point flow is considered: :v_r=- \\\\alpha r, :v_z=2\\\\alpha z, :v_\\\\theta=\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{2\\\\pi r}g(r), where \\\\alpha>0 (strain rate) and \\\\Gamma>0 (circulation) are constants. The flow satisfies the continuity equation by the two first of the above equations. The azimuthal momentum equation of the Navier-Stokes equations then reduces toDrazin, P. G., & Riley, N. (2006).

The choice g(0)=0 ensures v_\\\\theta=0 at the axis. The solution is :g= 1 - \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha r^2}{2 u}\\\\right). The vorticity equation only gives a non-trivial component in the z-direction, given by :\\\\omega_z = \\\\frac{\\\\Gamma}{2\\\\pi u} \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha r^2}{2 u}\\\\right). Intuitively the flow can be understood by looking at the three terms in the vorticity equation for \\\\omega_z. The axial velocity v_z intensifies the vorticity of the vortex core at the axis by vortex stretching. The intensified vorticity tries to diffuse outwards radially, but prevented by radial vorticity convection due to v_r. The three-way balance establishes a steady solution.

He is most known for his films Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y (1997) and Double Take (2009) and Shadow World: Inside the Global Arms Trade (2011), based on the book by Andrew Feinstein. As of 2014, Grimonprez's upcoming project includes the feature films How to Rewind Your Dog.  Personal life  Grimonprez was born in 1962 in Roeselare, Belgium. After studying cultural anthropology, he went on to complete his studies in photography and mixed media at Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent. Grimonprez received an MFA in Video & Mixed Media at the School of Visual Arts in New York. In 1993, Grimonprez was accepted into Whitney Museum Independent Study Program and later attended the Jan van Eyck Academy in Maastricht, Netherlands. In 1993, Grimonprez worked on the series Besmette Stad for the program Ziggurat on Belgian television.  Themes  His films are characterised by a criticism of contemporary media manipulation, described as: \\"an attempt to make sense of the wreckage wrought by history.\\" This films \\"speak to the need to see history at a distance, but at the same time to speak from inside it\\". Other themes include the relationship between the individual and the mainstream image, the notion of zapping as \\"an extreme form of poetry\\", and the questioning of our consensus reality, which Grimonprez defines as: \\"a reality that is entangled with the stories we tell ourselves in the worldview we agree on sharing.\\" Grimonprez claims that \\"Hollywood seems to be running ahead of reality. The world is so awash in images that we related to 9/11 through images we had already projected out into the world. In a sense, fiction came back to haunt us as reality. A perpetual distraction, this illusion of abundance staged by techno-magic hid the ugly face of an info-dystopia. Images of Abu Ghraib, 9/11, swine flu, the BP Gulf oil spill and the economic crisis composed our new contemporary sublime.\\" Amongst Grimonprez's influences are Walter Benjamin, Jorge Luis Borges, and Don DeLillo.  Films = Shadow World = Shadow World is a documentary about the international weapons trade. The film is based on Andrew Feinstein's book \\"The Shadow World: Inside the Global Arms Trade\\" (2011). Feinstein's book exposes the \\"parallel world of money, corruption, deceit and death\\" behind the trade in arms. Key interviews include: Jeremy Scahill, Chris Hedges, Michael Hardt, Noam Chomsky among others. Grimonprez claims that \\"the contemporary condition of what it is to be human calls into question the relevance of politics and reality, one that has collapsed under the weight of an information overload and mass deception.\\" To him the present political debate \\"has schrunk into mere fear management and paranoia suddenly seems the only sensible state of being, where it is easier to ponder the end of the world than to imagine viable political alternatives. \\"Shying away from getting stuck into merely critiquing social evil, I began exploring alternatives. It's indeed important to say what we don't want, but more crucial is to point at what we actually do want.\\" According to Grimonprez, the film not only exposes how corruption drives the global arms trade, while it often sets the stage for war, it hopes to offer also alternatives to the paradigm of greed, celebrated by social darwinism. = Double Take = Released in 2009, Double Take combines documentary and fictional elements. The plot, written by British novelist Tom McCarthy, centres on Alfred Hitchcock and a fictitious meeting Hitchcock has with an older version of himself during the Cold War. Using the allegory of a sky- borne threat, Double Take charts the rise of the television in the domestic setting and with it, the ensuing commodification of fear. The five Folgers commercials for instant coffee that play throughout Double Take are standing for the commercial break of the television format as well as for the exploration of the theme that fear and murder lurks in the domestic setting. Inspired by the Jorge Luis Borges short story \\"25th August, 1983\\", it plays on the Hitchcockian/Borgesian aphorism that \\"if you should meet your double, you should kill him... Or he will kill you...‚Äù This encounter with the double or the mirroring of Hitchcock versus Hitchcock (as Hitchcock frequently doubled himself as the storyteller in his films through his cameos), sketches out the theme of the doppelg√§nger- the parody of the original. This mirrors the plot of rivalry between cinema (Hitchcock the filmmaker), its television double (Hitchcock the television-maker) and the younger YouTube Hitchcock. This mistaken identity is described by Grimonprez as \\"the uncanny feeling that in a situation, something, or someone looks exactly the same as another, but somehow is not, and hence is totally displaced. It creates an unease and a sense of anxiety announcing the impending disaster, but precisely because of this, reveals a glimpse of the sublime.\\" = Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y = Dial H-I- S-T-O-R-Y is an essay film that traces the history of airplane hijackings as portrayed in mainstream television. Set against a backdrop of a chronology of airline hijackings, beginning with the first documented airplane hijacking in 1931, which was immediately inscribed into the political arena from the get- go. Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y illustrates how, as hijackings got progressively more television coverage, they became more and more deadly. The nature of live television allowed for a minute by minute update of the hijack as the situation unravelled; blurring the line between entertainment and tragedy, For terrorists seeking to inscribe their struggle in history, the hijack devoid of the mediatized image of itself lost all of its communicative power. With the airplane always on the move between countries and borders as if in state of nowhere, the hijack came to symbolize the transgression across a violent border towards a political utopia. \\"This study in pre-Sept. 11 terrorism\\" is interspersed with passages from Don DeLillo's novels Mao II and White Noise, \\"providing a literary and philosophic anchor to the film.\\" Questioning the role of the writer in an image saturated society, Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Ys narrative is based on an imagined dialogue between a terrorist and a novelist where the writer contends that the terrorist has hijacked his role within society: \\"there's a curious knot that binds novelists and terrorists. Years ago I used to think it was possible for a novelist to alter the inner life of the culture. Now bomb-makers and gunmen have taken that territory.\\" As the plot progresses, it becomes clear that with the increasing media coverage of terrorist hijacks, this power of producing an inward societal shock has been wrestled from the writer by the terrorist. They are 'playing a zero-sum game' where ‚Äúwhat the terrorists gain, novelists lose!‚Äù By the 1990s, the individual hijackers apparently are no more, \\"replaced on our TV screens by stories of state-sponsored suitcase bombs\\". By now, the media is increasingly involved as a key player; \\"the images of the individual is substituted by a flow of crowds; hijacking is replaced by anonymous suitcase bombs. [...] Since the eighties, the Reagan Administration started to accommodate the terrorist spectacle to veil its own dirty game in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Terrorism became merely a superficial game played through the media\\". In this sense, the deeper underlying theme is that the hijackers' hijack was becoming itself hijacked by news media corporations. The piece premiered in 1997 at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris and was later screened at documenta X in Kassel. = \\"Kobarweng or Where is Your Helicopter?\\" = The short documentary \\"Kobarweng or Where is Your Helicopter?\\" (1992) deals with the history of a remote village in the highlands of New Guinea. The videotape assembles archival footage and oral histories depicting the first encounter between the Irian Jaya people and the scientific crew, including anthropologists, of the Dutch Star Mountains Expedition. The confrontation with the crew and their helictopter caused a shock that threw the worldview of the villagers upside down. The event even entered their Sibil-tongue language; literally translated, weng means language, whilst kobar airplane. \\"Kobarweng's\\" title is an ironic reference to a question first posed to Grimonprez by a local man named Kaiang Tapor, who, upon Grimonprez's arrival in the village of Pepera after a three-day hike, asked him where his helicopter was. The footage in the film is traversed by a running band of script, reporting observations and remarks culled from anthropologists' interviews, eye-witness reports, and the reminiscences of those highlanders who recall those moments of 'first contact' between the white intruders (missionaries, prospectors, anthropologists, adventurers) and the local inhabitants: \\"We never tell everything, we always keep something for the next anthropologist\\" they are candid enough to admit to Margaret Mead, while another wit remarks: \\"We called the whites 'people of soap', but their shit smelled the same as ours.\\" Switching the roles of observer and observed, the relation implied in the anthropological representation is reversed: the desire of the observing anthropologist itself becomes ‚Äúother‚Äù, ‚Äúexotic‚Äù, an object of curiosity destabilised by the villager's questions. According to Grimonprez: In 1994, Grimonprez showcased a five-channel installation, It Will Be All Right If You Come Again, Only Next Time Don't Bring Any Gear, Except a Tea Kettle..., which expanded upon the themes of \\"Kobarweng\\". The encounter between the different groups in 1939 up to the current problems caused by neocolonialism: The province is occupied by the Indonesian military and according to a Yale University Law School report \\"there can be little doubt that the Indonesian government has engaged in a systematic pattern of acts that has resulted in harm to a substantial part of the indigenous population of West Papua.\\" Amnesty International found that there were no effective means for people of the public could complain against the police acting in violation of international law and standards.  Curated programs  All curated programs, in the form of a video lounge, could be seen as a media-jamming tool at the hand of an extensive collection of clips, that can be envisioned both as the joyful affirmation of a global disengagement of corporations abducting our very essence, patenting and privatizing for profit, alienating our food & bodies by creating a genetically modified variant and the catalyst of debate. According to Grimonprez, the participatory elements would be sometimes as simple as a hot cup of coffee. \\"We would never install our video-library without having cookies, the smell of coffee and the remote control present. These elements already induce a platform of conviviality, an atmosphere for chatting. You are invited to pick up the remote to zap through your own choice of videotapes, in a way to be your own curator.\\" = Beware! In Playing the Phantom, You Become One = Beware! In Playing the Phantom, You Become One is a videolounge based on the history of television, created in collaboration with Herman Asselberghs. In the work, Grimonprez questioned the image of the spectator as a passive consumer and seeks to detect the impact of images on our feelings, our knowledge and our memory. In his opinion, the homogeneity of what the media have to offer presents a creative context in which images can consciously be read the wrong way. The boring uniformity of mainstream TV can never impose uniformity in its perception. = Maybe the Sky is Really Green, and We‚Äôre Just Colourblind: On Zapping, Close Encounters and the Commercial Break = This ongoing curated video-library/vlogging installation is a project on the history of the remote control and zapping in relation to the commercial break and how zapping and channel surfing were installed as a new way to relate to the world in the 80s. While Walter Benjamin and Sergei Eisenstein defined montage as a revolutionary tool for social analysis, MTV and CNN have surpassed this. Grimonprez said: \\"I saw what CNN did with war footage and then all these commercials spliced in between. I thought of the zapping as the ultimate form of poetry. It‚Äôs a visual poem.\\" The project continues as, according to Grimonprez, zapping became useless after 9/11 as all channels were beaming the very same images of the collapsing \\"Towering Infernos\\", over and over again. No longer did the media have to keep up with reality, but rather reality was now keeping up with the media. No longer happy innocent consumers of a bygone TV era, we are said to have become both avid consumers of fear and the protagonists of an increasing ubiquity of systems of surveillance. Art Grimonprez made his international debut on the art circuit at the documenta X in Kassel with his Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y in 1997. Ten years later, the first retrospective of his work, Johan Grimonprez - Retrospective 1992‚Äì2007, was exhibited at the Pinakothek der Moderne in Munich, 2007. It‚Äôs a Poor Sort of Memory that Only Works Backwards followed as the first large-scale retroperspective of Grimonprez in his home country, Belgium, in the Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (SMAK) in Ghent, 2011‚Äì2012. Artforum described the exhibition as \\"an unfamiliar archive [...] from the perception of fragments to the awareness of a common mentality, from the multiplicity of words to the emergence of a discourse\\". Several artists, among Roy Villevoy, Jan Dietvorst and Adam Curtis, were invited to contribute to this exhibition. A prominent aspect in Grimonprez's work is the sky: \\"a canvas on which man has always projected his mystical aspirations, his political and economic struggles, and his poetic imaginings. They abstract spaces into which the very real histories of contemporary societies are woven\\". According to Artforum, the critical dimension of Grimonprez's work follows close behind the \\"aesthetic of disaster and terror and the virtues of channel surfing in order to plunge the viewer into a state of genuine fascination\\". Using repetition and delay, Grimonprez works towards a second glance; a double take - just like his feature-length film Double Take (2009), and \\"the state of confusion in which we are kept by the media machine\\". Artforum states that Grimonprez \\"does not harangue us with denunciations but rather suggests that we reconsider the short circuits of this machine, of which we briefly catch glimpses\\". It‚Äôs a Poor Sort of Memory that Only Works Backwards also exhibited at the Blaffer Art Museum in Houston, 2011 and the retrospective Johan Grimonprez exhibited in The Fruitmarket Gallery in Edinburgh, 2010.

Founded 50 years ago by the Cuthbert family, it was the pioneer in the sited tent market. Canvas Holidays - which has its headquarters in Dunfermline, Scotland - has campsites in a variety of countries in Europe, including France, Italy, Croatia and Spain. There are some very strange campsite managers and even weirder couriers. They all seem to smell peculiar.  Background  In 1964, Jim Cuthbert and his wife Margaret Cuthbert decided to set up a camping holiday company. The idea came to them after being on a family holiday themselves, where they had witnessed many families cramming their cars full of camping equipment. It was then that Jim Cuthbert thought it would be more convenient to provide campsites which already had the equipment ready for use, and so Canvas was born. In 1967, four more campsites were added and Jim Cuthbert was awarded a Daily Telegraph travel award for most innovative holiday idea. Further improvements to the Canvas campsites followed, with a site being added in Italy in 1968 and electric lights being introduced in 1969. By the 1970s, route maps had been added to travel packs, fully sprung beds replaced air mattresses and crockery was introduced. In the 1970s, another British camping holiday company ‚Äì Eurocamp ‚Äì was established, providing competition for Canvas. The following decade was a time of further improvements to Canvas' campsites, with the first Spanish campsite being added in 1981. Throughout the remainder of the 1980s, the first mobile homes were introduced, as was the Hoopi's Club programme for children. The founder of the company, Jim Cuthbert, was also awarded the Soleil d'Or from the French Government in 1985 for his contribution to the travel industry. Over the recent decades, Canvas Holidays continued to progress with the times, introducing a new computerized bookings system in 1994, as well as establishing a new range of tents ‚Äì the ‚ÄòMark IV Tent' and the ‚ÄòBalmoral'. Updated mobile homes ‚Äì equipped with dishwashers and CD players ‚Äì were introduced as part of the ‚ÄòMillennium' range in 2003, and air conditioning was added to mobile homes in Italy and the South of France in 2004. Canvas also improved the family friendly aspect of their company, introducing free travel for under 18s in 1996, a Toddler Club for under 4s in 2000 and the ‚ÄòFamilyExtra' programme in 2009.  Management  At the beginning of the 1990s, Canvas Holidays suffered financial difficulties. Due to poor control of costs, revenues fell and thus, the company was sold. Having been under the management of the Cuthbert family for 27 years, in 1992 Canvas Holidays was bought by Andrew Salvesen and George Elles. This partnership bought 75% of the business for ¬£2.5 million, and the headquarters moved to Dunfermline, where they are still based today. Two years later, Salvesen bought the remaining shares from the Cuthbert family. This marked the beginning of a new management team in the business, of which Ian Inwood and Martin Sherring were included. In November 2002, Canvas underwent further changes. Salvesen left Canvas and, with the support of Bank of Scotland and 3i, Inwood and Sherring bought the company from the previous principal shareholder (Salvesen). In 2005, Canvas Holidays became part of the Wyndham Worldwide Corporation. Simon Allan, the current Managing Director of the company, joined Canvas in the early 1990s as a Children's Courier. He became MD in 2010. It has 200 employees.

It is situated about south east of Carnarvon, north east of Denham and east of Great Northern Highway. On the north and west boundary is Brick House Station, north-east boundary Meeragoolia station, eastern boundary Ella Valla Station and southern boundary Edagee Station. The Gascoyne River is north of the northern boundary and the coast west of the western boundary. The long term average rainfall is 214 mm and the median average is 194 mm. History In 1867 Dansy Powell (aged 5) arrived in Fremantle, Australia with his mother and sister Sarahhttps://www.bradyfamilytree.org/genealogy to meet up with his father George Powell, from Herefordshire, England, who had been sent out as a convict (convict no 7821) for sheep stealing. In 1882 Dansy Powell arrived in the Gascoyne District with a survey party and shortly afterwards took up Meeragoolia Station. He then sold Meeragoolia to Dan Matheson and took up the Callagiddy country, which was the first portion of the area between Carnarvon and Wooramel to be taken up and stocked.Northern Times,31 march 1928, page6 In 1894 Powell married Ellen Matilda Bird, and their first child James was born at Callagiddy in 1896. They had nine children, all of whom except the last, Jessie, were born at the station. After the sale of Callagiddy in 1909 the family moved to Wagin, where they farmed over the generations until 2018. Records show in 1905 the property was owned by Messrs Powell and McNish, who were running sheep on Callagiddy. The partnership was dissolved in 1906 with Powell taking full ownership. Powell sold the property in 1909 to Messrs Jackman and Balston for ¬£16,500; at the time it was stocked with 11,000 sheep. H. Farrar was appointed manager in 1910 of Callagiddy after three years at Minilya Station. Later the same year 10,000 sheep were shorn, producing 168 bales of wool. A large portion of the property was burned in 1923 by bushfires. Surrounding properties, including Jimba Jimba, Boologooroo, Brick House, Minilya and Wandagee, also lost large areas of grassland in the blaze. More bushfires swept through the area in 1927, with Callagiddy, Brick House, Doorawarrah, Ella Valla and other properties all losing large areas of feed to the fires. Jackman sold the property in 1930 for ¬£37,000 to the Waite family. The property was stocked with 16,000 sheep at the time. Peter Johnston took over management of the family station in 1985 and had full ownership by 1987.

In late 1832, Hall became mining engineer at South Hetton in addition to his other duties. Over the next four years, he made his first major contribution to the mining industry by developing the tub, cage and guide-rod system for raising coal from the pit,Hall T.Y.Correspondence 20 September 1834.

These had increased in size over the years from 3 cwt. to about 6 cwt., making them difficult to fill and handle underground and prone to snagging while being lifted in the shaft. Adding to the difficulties was the common practice amongst miners of hanging to the ropes or lifting chain to ascend and descend the 1500 ft or more of the pit shaft. Hall replaced the corves with low tubs which ran on rails underground. Initially these were emptied at the shaft bottom, but he subsequently developed a frame or cage into which several tubs could be loaded for lifting. To prevent the cage fouling the sides of the shaft, he developed an idea proposed initially by a Mr. Curr of Sheffield and fitted guide rods to constrain it. A model of the system was exhibited at the Polytechnic Exhibition Newcastle and Museum of Practical Geology, London. These developments had a profound effect on mining costs which Hall later quantified as a saving of 1s.3 d. per ton of coal or over ¬£1m. p.a. for the NE Coalfield Hall T.Y. Notes on the production and consumption of coal in France Trans. NEIMME, (1858)Vol.6, p.49, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1858 By 1836, Hall was entering a partnership with Buddle and Potter to work the Ryton Glebe and Stella Collieries. This soon extended to the Townley Main and Whitefield pits and workings in the Crawcrook area. The group became known as the Stella Coal Company and traded successfully until the 1860s. Hall became resident at Stella House and, as part of the developments, leased an area of land to the west of Blaydon Burn, Fig.1.NEIMME TYHall's papers, Folder 2C10 ‚Äì Blaydon Lease, NEIMME, Newcastle upon Tyne, 1841. As his principal interest was the development of the Stella staithes, land was sub-leased to a range of industrial users including an acid and white lead factory. These complex legal arrangements were to return to haunt him in later life. Fig.1. T.Y.Hall's Map of Stella, 1840  America  In the late 1830s, the Blackheath Colliery, Etna and Mid-Lothian pits in Cleveland County, Virginia, were devastated by fire and explosion, resulting in what the NEIMME reported as, ‚Äúsacrifice of life in negro workmen\\".

Walter Scott, London, 1895. [Internet]Accessed at This was clearly a highly lucrative development for Hall. For restoring a mine valued at ¬£50k, he was initially offered ¬£10k for his involvement, subsequently amended to a ¬£7k share option and a five-year term as Mining Superintendent on a salary linked to production (and frequently quoted as circa ¬£2k p.a.). Following the intervention of Thos. Wood,Wood T.Bound Correspondence, DCRO NCB01/TH11,1840, p.42. it was agreed that Hall should receive \\" normal Viewers' customary perquisites\\" and be allowed to pursue private work for three months in the year. This led to him crossing the Atlantic 16 times between 1839 and 1843, no mean achievement in the age before steamships were fully established. The Agreement for the formation of the Chesterfield Coal & Iron Mining Company dated 30 April 1840,DCRO Agreement for the formation of the Chesterfield Coal and Iron Company. DCRO, NCB01/TH11 p.33. lists John Heth (Virginia), Charles Scarrisbrick (Lancaster) George Morten (Old Bond St.), Thos Wood (Castle Eden) and Samuel Amory (Throgmorton St.) amongst the directors. Arrangements for Hall are detailed, even specifying that during his time in America he should have, \\"two horses for his use and the keep of a cow\\". Welford notes that having an English company holding assets in America caused constitutional issues, requiring negotiations with the American Government. During his time in America, Hall took an interest in mining in Russia, including the publication of a letter in the New York Herald in 1840 arguing the case for a railway from St.Petersberg to Moscow. This led to Gen. Tcheffkine, the Czar's Director of Mining, and a Russian delegation visiting Tyneside to study railway and mining practice. The party spent several days at Stella with Hall and the local Consul, John Thomas Carr, presenting Hall with a gold medal and letter of appreciation from the Czar,Fordyce W.

(1848) A further concern during this period was the developing problem with the Stella Haugh land. Townley, who had previously controlled the lease, sought to demonstrate that Hall had neglected his duties as lessee and landlord, which would potentially have allowed him to benefit from the considerable investment which Hall and his sub-lessees had made over more than a decade.

Hall noted that coal had been mined there since 200 BC, but considered the industry very backward and ended his paper with an exhortation to capitalists and engineers to seek concessions there. Technical developments In addition to his economic insights, Hall was involved in several technical developments. Following the Stephenson / Davy controversy about the origins of the safety lamp, opinion was divided between gauze and glass lamps: it was argued that the former could, in some circumstances, be unsafe whereas the latter sometimes gave only limited light. Hall was party to an ingenious set of experiments initiated by Nicholas Wood at the Killingworth and Wallsend CollieriesWood N.Experiments to test various safety lamps, tried at Wallsend Colliery.

He was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a left-arm orthodox spin bowler. He was born at Rothwell in Yorkshire. Cricket career Cromack played second eleven cricket for Yorkshire in 1955 but was not able to break into the county's first team. He joined Leicestershire in 1959, following in the footsteps of Jack van Geloven, also in Yorkshire's 1955 second team, and made his first-class debut in two matches that season, bowling just four overs in the two games. In 1960, in a very weak Leicestershire team, Cromack played in 20 first-team matches, often, in a brittle batting line-up, coming in as high as No 6, though he averaged less than 11 runs per innings for the season. With a bowling attack geared towards seam bowling with Terry Spencer and Brian Boshier, and an established spinner in John Savage, Cromack was bowled sparingly, and took only 28 wickets all season. The match against Middlesex at Lord's was his sixth first-class game, but to that point he had taken just two first-class wickets; he took six for 48 in Middlesex's first innings, the best bowling figures of his career. But then Leicestershire had to follow on and when they batted again they squandered a first-wicket partnership of 196 by losing all 10 wickets for a further 18 runs, giving the home team an easy victory. Two weeks later, he scored 55 against Hampshire, his highest score. There was a second half- century at the end of June with 53 in the game against Nottinghamshire. But Cromack's season subsided after that and he was left out of several matches in August. He reappeared regularly in the first month of the 1961 season, but had neither batting nor bowling success, and was dropped by early June. He did not play first-class cricket again, apart from a solitary appearance in 1968 when Leicestershire were beset by injuries and Test calls, and he played in a rain- ruined match against Surrey, but did not bat or bowl.

In other words, both place of birth and Albanian parentage are relevant for determining whether a person is an Albanian citizen. It is regulated by the \\"Law on Albanian Citizenship\\".Law on Albanian Citizenship In some circumstances citizenship is granted to children born in Albania to non-Albanian parents. This is not the case where parents are temporary or short-term visitors. As suggested by the UN and Council of Europe, all efforts are made in order to avoid statelessness. Birth in Albania A person born in Albania to non-Albanian parents is an Albanian citizen if that person: * Holds no other nationality at the time of birth (i.e., is stateless) * Parents reside in Albania and consent to the acquisition of citizenship * Is adopted while a minor by an Albanian citizen residing in Albania Effectively this means that: * The children of resident immigrants can acquire Albanian citizenship * Foundlings acquire citizenship automatically Furthermore, if parents of a foundling become identified, citizenship right remains, unless parents request otherwise before the 14th birthday. Birth to an Albanian parent Access to Albanian citizenship by birth is automatic if: * Born in Albania and one parent is Albanian * One parent is Albanian and the other is stateless or of unknown status; regardless of birthplace * Born to two Albanian citizens, regardless of birthplace One Albanian parent is sufficient condition for the right to immediate citizenship, upon request, regardless of birthplace. Naturalisation A person may be naturalised as an Albanian citizen if he fulfills the following criteria: * Over 18 years old * Shelter and the means of sustain himself * Has not been convicted to sentences of three or more years in prison (except for political sentences) * Basic knowledge of the Albanian language * Does not endanger the security of the Republic of Albania * Continuous residence in Albania for five years This period can be reduced to: * Three years, if Albanian ancestry can be proved to a second degree (at least one Albanian grandparent) * One year, if has been married for three years to an Albanian citizen If Albania has an economic, cultural or scientific interest, an adult as foreigner can be granted immediate citizenship, provided (s)he does not pose any public threat. The only requirement for stateless applicants is the five-year residence requirement and not posing a threat to the Republic of Albania. Unemancipated minors obtain Albanian citizenship automatically at the same time a parent is naturalised. For minors above 14 years of age, their consent is required. Albanian citizenship by adoption Children adopted by Albanian citizens acquire Albanian citizenship. If only one of the foster parents is Albanian, both parents must agree. This is not necessary if the residence of the child will be in Albania, or the other parent is stateless. Loss of citizenship It is possible to lose Albanian citizenship in the following circumstances =Renunciation= An Albanian citizen aged 18 and over may renounce Albanian citizenship, provided: * (s)he does not remain stateless * (s)he does not reside in Albania * (s)he does not have pending civilian trials or penal proceedings =Children= If both parents renounce Albanian citizenship and request the same for their child. Children under the age of 18 also lose Albanian citizenship if adopted by a foreigners, and the child acquires another nationality upon adoption. =Deprivation of Albanian citizenship= Albanian citizenship can be withdrawn if a person has acquired it submitting intentionally false documentation. Albanian citizenship is also withdrawn to children aged less than 18, of said parents, provided they do not remain stateless. Resumption of Albanian citizenship A person who has renounced his/her Albanian citizenship in order to obtain another one may resume it if he fails to obtain the new one. A former citizen who wishes to resume Albanian citizenship, applies for naturalisation. Dual citizenship Albanian law permits all Albanian nationals to obtain any other nationality without losing their Albanian nationality (unless the law about the other newly acquired citizenship or nationality requires it).

The Soci√©t√© des Avions Ren√© Couzinet manufactured a range of Couzinet aircraft during the 1920s and 1930s.AeroStories Biographie of Ren√© Couzinet. (1904-1956) Glory to forfeiture Biography Couzinet's father was a school teacher, and from a very young age he was fascinated by aviation and observing the flight of swallows. In 1921 he enrolled at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Arts et M√©tiers (ENSAM) (School of Arts and Crafts) at Angers (with Louis B√©chereau), where he both graduated and filed several aviation patents. In 1924 he attended the √âcole sup√©rieure de l‚Äôa√©ronautique (Graduate School of Aeronautics). He financed his studies by working in a turbine factory, before joining the French Air Force (Arm√©e de l'air) in November 1925, where he became a lieutenant. In 1927, he built the Couzinet 10 Arc-en-Ciel (Rainbow) No 1, a modern shape for its time. It was a three-engined monoplane with thick wings and a tapered body and tailplane, which was characteristic of all Arc- en-Ciels to follow. Jacques Lacoste, managing director of engine manufacturer Hispano-Suiza, lent him three engines without charge, and additionally he raised a loan of $50,000 US Dollars. The Arc-en-Ciel's first flight was on 7 May 1928. The aircraft manufacturer ANF Les Mureaux agreed to take charge of the first prototype, with Couzinet consulting, making observations and studies. The leading French engineer Albert Caquot was also involved with the project. In 1928, he built the Couzinet 27, a four-seater which crashed during trials on August 8, 1928. The mechanic Lanet was killed immediately, the pilot Drouin died a few days later, and Manuel Gianoli survived. On 17 February 1930 a fire destroyed the workshops of √âmile-Louis Letord at Meudon, losses these included a twin tri-motor engined Couzinet 20 and a Couzinet 27 Arc-en-Ciel II.Aerostories. Ren√© Couzinet - from glory to decline L'\\"Arc-en-Ciel\\", 14 June 1934, landed for the first time at Fernando de Noronha, Brazil. The Couzinet 33 Biarritz, a four-seater passenger plane, made its first flight on 25 November 1931. From March 6 to April 5, 1932, it completed the first air link from France to New Caledonia piloted by Charles de Verneilh Puyraseau, Max D√©v√© second pilot and radio operator, and Emile Munch mechanic. The crew were unharmed by its rough landing at Tontouta Noum√©a but it was dismantled and shipped back to France by sea. The Biarritz, repaired and equipped with more powerful engines, went on to perform in Europe, including a flight carrying Pierre Cot, the French air minister, between Moscow and Paris, as well as to make several flights in Africa, including to the Cape Verde Islands. Returning from North Africa, it crashed at Blaisy-Bas in the C√¥te-d'Or on 30 October 1933. The Couzinet 70 Arc-en-Ciel III made its first flight on 11 February 1932. On 16 January 1933, piloted by Jean Mermoz and accompanied by Couzinet himself, he crossed the South Atlantic from Saint-Louis, Senegal, to Natal, Brazil, in less than twelve hours. Their triumphant return to Le Bourget on 21 May 1933 was greeted by 15,000 people, and the aircraft was then operated by Air France until 1937. All the aircraft retained the same three-engined layout but were never fully accepted by the officials of the French aeronautics industry. In 1933, separated from ANF Les Mureaux, Couzinet was on the verge of bankruptcy so the research agency was integrated with the Breguet Aviation (Soci√©t√© anonyme des ateliers d‚Äôaviation Louis Breguet) in Villacoublay. In 1952 he released photographs of a model for his flying saucer, the Couzinet RC-360. A vertical takeoff aircraft (VTOL) that used two contra-rotating discs powered by three engines. A second model was designed with six Lycoming engines (180 hp each) and one Marcel Dassault Viper turbojet.Ren√© Couzinet's RC-360 -L'A√©rodyne (1952) - Flying saucerUSAF Air Intelligence Digest.

Death and commemoration During World War II he emigrated to Brazil and was responsible for the technical direction of their national aviation policy. On return to France he found most consultancy opportunities were closed to him, and his many futuristic projects, hydrofoil and vertical take-off aircraft, did not progress beyond concepts and models. In despair, on 16 December 1956 he killed both himself and his wife Gilberte. He is buried in the cemetery of Bagneux, Paris. The at La Roche-sur-Yon is named A√©rodrome Ren√©-Couzinet.

In other words, once the opponent starts to attack, the defending combatant performs this technique. The go no sen technique can take various forms, since it depends on the use of the energy and momentum of the attacker. This is not just counter-attack. Go no sen is a mental state, a level of concentration assumed during combat. It is more correct to say that it is a harmonization with the very movement of attack, not just defense. Go no sen is developed through repetitive training, with only one focus, to attack and defend at the same time achieving the most efficient results to end a confrontation. One of the methods to grab ki (Ê∞ó, energy) so that it can be manipulated, is to wait for the opponent's move. Once it has been made, the defender takes the strength used by the attacker, incapacitating it, their weapon of use and intention. Go no sen extinguishes all combative possibilities from flowing within that moment, ending the confrontation with its own ki. For this, it is necessary to capture the move at the right moment. There must be harmony between the two fighters, but only one needs to mentally and emotionally embrace it, to extinguish the ki of the other. If the opponent is simply opposed, there will be only shock and loss of strength for both. If there is harmony, this loss will be limited to the attacker. Besides the martial aspect, go no sen can be seen as part of a philosophical and moral code, emphasized when one considers the term \\"do\\" (, d≈ç), meaning that the budoka (Ê≠¶ÈÅìÂÆ∂, follower of budo) should never take the initiative in an eventual and inevitable confrontation. In karate, this is seen in the saying .

It offers a crowdfunding model to support a variety of Open Access book and journal content packages as well as the financial funding of partnerships.  History  Knowledge Unlatched was established in September 2012 by publisher and social entrepreneur Frances Pinter. It was the formalisation of the ‚ÄòGlobal Library Consortium‚Äô model for supporting Open Access books, developed by Pinter as a response to a protracted crisis in monograph publishing and the opportunities presented by digital technology and Open Access models. Pinter first aired her vision for a Global Library Consortium approach to supporting Open Access monograph publishing at the Charleston Conference in 2010. In September 2011, she embarked on a speaking tour of Australia. Her tour included a keynote presentationACU Research Net on academic publishing and the future of the monograph at Queensland University of Technology, arranged by Lucy Montgomery, who would go on to become Deputy Director of Knowledge Unlatched.The KU Team In 2016, the legal structure of Knowledge Unlatched (KU) was changed from a British Community Interest Company (CIC) to a German GmbH (limited liability company). In that year, Sven Fund acquired parts of KU CIC's assets, while transferring them into a for-profit company, Knowledge Unlatched GmbH, which is 100% owned by the consultancy fullstopp GmbH. Sven Fund is managing director of both companies. Pinter, the founder of KU CIC, was planning to retire in that period and became director of the then legally independent research unit, KU Research, which operates under the former founding organisation's name, KU CIC.  Business model  In its first two collections (the Pilot and Round 2), Knowledge Unlatched piloted a collective procurement approach to Open Access books. The modelThe Wellcome Trust put forward by Pinter in 2011 depends on many libraries from around the world sharing the payment of a single title fee to a publisher, in return for a book being made available via a Creative Commons licence through one of Open Access repository services, such as the Open Research Library,Open Research Library \\"Open Access Publishing in European Networks\\" (OAPEN) and the HathiTrust Digital Library as a fully downloadable PDF or EPUB file. According to multiple sources, Knowledge Unlatched is cited among other innovative publishing-market initiatives focused on the Open Access sector that have been successful in pooling the funding from subscribing libraries for covering the costs of transitioning monographs or journals into Gold Open Access, which removes access barriers to readers around the world. = KU Open Funding = KU Open Funding is a database for financing Open Access books. It enables scientists and libraries to compare offerings from different publishers. Suitable offers can be found on the basis of more than 20 criteria, such as the subject area, the services of publishers, forms of licensing and publication costs. If the latter accepts the manuscript for publication after quality control, KU organises the approval and handling of payment with the library. More than twenty publishers such as Berghahn Books, Duke University Press, Intellect, University of Michigan Press, Taylor & Francis, Transcript Verlag and Ubiquity Press participated with their Open Access offerings during the launch in November 2018.  KU Partners  Knowledge Unlatched partners with several open access initiatives, which includes collects funding. To date KU has partnered up with 12 different initiatives including OAPEN, IntechOpen, Language Science Press, the Peter Lang publishing group, and Transcript Open Library Political Science. As predatory publishers represent a concern for the Open Access sector, Knowledge Unlatched is not involved directly in quality assurance procedures, for which publishers bear sole responsibility. This topic is widely discussed in relation to the publication of scholarly articles. Yet with regard to both academic monographs and scholarly papers, publisher-level review procedures and industry-wide quality assurance mechanisms exist. In addition, divergent opinions exist concerning the harm of predatory publishing, particularly in relation to the role of Open Access in rendering scientific and scholarly knowledge widely accessible as a public good, as Martin Paul Eve and Ernesto Priego have argued in their article. As the role of preprint servers during the Covid-19 crisis indicates, Open Access is not antithetical to maintaining quality controls with regard to disseminating research results.  Awards  Knowledge Unlatched was shortlisted for the ALPSP Awards for Innovation in Publishing 2016.ALPSP Website In September 2015, Knowledge Unlatched won the Curtin University Award for Best Innovation in Education 2015.

It is one of Schubert's six unfinished symphonies. It was begun in May 1818, with initial sketches made for the opening sections of the first movement and finale. He abandoned this symphony after this initial phase of work and never returned to it, probably due to dissatisfaction with it, although Schubert would live for another ten years. Although conductor and composer Brian Newbould has made a performing version of the fragments, a full completion has not yet been attempted. History=Composition= This sketch is the first of a series of four unfinished symphonies ‚Äì D 615, D 708A, D 729 (the seventh), and D 759 (the eighth) ‚Äì that are milestones in Schubert's symphonic development between the sixth and ninth symphonies. These four symphonies are in varying states of completion: D 615 has incomplete sketches of only two movements (the allegro and the finale), D 708A has incomplete sketches of all four movements, D 729 is structurally complete but was not fully orchestrated, and D 759 has the first two movements complete and orchestrated and a third movement in an incomplete piano sketch. Previously, his fourth symphony had had Beethovenian influence (although it is more reminiscent of the earlier Sturm und Drang movement), his fifth Mozartian influence, and his sixth Rossinian influence (Schubert had listened to Rossini's music before writing his sixth symphony and was extremely impressed, then incorporating aspects of Rossini's style into his music). After writing the sixth symphony, Schubert experienced a crisis in his symphonic output, as he was not sure about whether he should continue on the path he was on in the sixth symphony of being influenced by Rossini. There is thus some Beethovenian influence present, which would persist throughout his symphonic output, but Schubert soon creates his own style and explores new territory. Additionally, he was still learning how to master instrumental writing, despite having done so for vocal works some years before. His mastery of songwriting was helped by the fact that the words gave hints as to the structure he would use, help that could not come in instrumental writing. This can be seen from the fact that Schubert had written his first six symphonies directly into full orchestral score, without sketching for piano beforehand, but D 615 and D 708A only survive as sketches in piano score. He returned to writing directly into orchestral score for his seventh symphony, although piano sketches exist for the eighth. These four unfinished symphonies thus show how Schubert was, as he stated in a letter from the mid-1820s, preoccupied with \\"planning a path to [write] a grand symphony [plans he would realize in the ninth symphony]\\", with his string quartets, octet and these unfinished symphonies as intermediate steps in this plan. The unusually large number of unfinished symphonies on the way to the ninth from the sixth show how preoccupied he was with writing this great symphony, and how important this plan was to him. =Discovery= In the mid-20th century, Dr. Ernst Hilmar discovered in a library in Vienna (the Wienbibliothek im Rathaus) a folio containing works by Schubert, titled \\"Sinfonie\\" and dated to May 1818. It contained sketches for nine movements, all in D major or related keys. In 1951, Otto Erich Deutsch assumed in the first edition of his catalogue of Schubert's works that all the material was for one symphony, which he labelled D 615. However, stylistic evidence shows that the material could not all have been for one symphony, notwithstanding the fact that there was simply too much material to serve for one symphony. In fact the folio was labelled \\"Zwei Symphonien in D\\" (\\"Two Symphonies in D\\"), indicating that a librarian had previously thought along similar lines around 1900. A 1978 analysis of watermarks and handwriting proved that there was really three symphonies present: these were D 615 (2 movements, written 1818), D 708A (4 movements, written 1821), and D 936A (3 movements, written 1828; commonly referred to as Schubert's tenth symphony). These separate Deutsch numbers were given in the 1978 second edition of the Deutsch catalogue. As the sketches for D 615 were much more fragmentary than those for D 936A, Brian Newbould did not attempt to complete D 615 when he worked on completing Schubert's seventh, eighth and tenth symphonies in the 1990s, although he did orchestrate the existing fragments. Furthermore, being still more fragmentary than D 708A, it still remained incomplete when Newbould completed the D 708A symphony in 2012 for a commission from BBC Radio 3. Movements *Schubert/Newbould Symphony D 615 in D major #Adagio, ‚Äî Allegro moderato, #[Allegretto], Extant material of every movement The sketches are written on two staves, with voice leading, and harmonies ranging from complete to partly indicated. The manuscript contains five instrumental indications, confirming that the intended orchestra was similar in size to the sixth symphony, without trombones (that would become part of the Schubertian orchestra only in the seventh and later symphonies). Conforming to this symphony still being firmly in the Classical style, this orchestra was the same as that employed in the symphonies of the Viennese masters Haydn, Mozart, and the first two symphonies of Ludwig van Beethoven. The sketches total about 7 minutes of music. The middle movements were probably never written, as the sketch for the finale begins on the same page as the end of the sketch for the opening movement. =First movement= : \\\\relative c' { \\\\key d \\\\minor \\\\tempo \\"Adagio\\" \\\\partial 4 d8.\\\\ff d16  a'1~->\\\\>  a2.\\\\pp\\\\\\\\! a8. a16(  2.)( 4  2 ) r4 8.\\\\pp 16 } :Beginning of slow introduction : \\\\relative c { \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\time 2/2 \\\\tempo \\"Allegro moderato\\" \\\\partial 4 a8.\\\\pp a16  a'2( fis4 d  e2 cis4 a  d) e8( cis d4) e-.  e2( fis4) d8. d16(  fis2 d4 b  e2~) e8( fis g a)  b2( \\\\times 2/3 { a4 g b,}  d2) cis4 } :First theme Like most of Schubert's early symphonies, this symphony opens with a slow introduction, which is cast in the key of D minor. Its beginning is somewhat reminiscent of the slow introduction to Haydn's 104th symphony, but it quickly moves into harmonically more remote territory, going as far as the tritone-related key of A major. This moves into a conventional sonata-form movement in D major, with a transition making heavy use of triplets with the second theme in the dominant key of A major, but the sketch terminates at the end of the exposition. Near the end of the exposition, cadences in C major are alternated with those in A major. Brian Newbould sees a falling off of quality during the exposition, saying that \\"despite some promising ideas it runs out of wind before Schubert rests his pen\\". =Second movement= : \\\\relative c { \\\\key d \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 \\\\tempo \\"[Allegretto]\\" d8.-.[ cis16-. d8.-. e16-.]  a,4. b16 cis  d8 d fis16 e d e  fis4( d8) r  a'8. dis,16 e8 fis  b, g'4 fis16 e \\\\appoggiatura e16 d8[ r16 d] \\\\appoggiatura d16 cis8[ r16 cis]  d4 r } :Rondo theme Although Maurice J. E. Brown took this to be a slow movement, Newbould interprets it to be almost certainly a finale, as it is in the tonic key of the symphony. It is in rondo form, the first of Schubert's symphonic finales to be in this form, but breaks off during the second statement of the theme. Newbould comments that \\"the finale is no less attractive [than the first movement], but perhaps Schubert in the end did not consider its prettiness and tendency to a loose balletic build as the right way forward for a maturing symphonist.\\" References * *Spirit of Schubert ‚Äì Brian Newbould *A new Schubert completion ‚Äì update *Spirit of Schubert Season comes to Radio 3 *Discovering Music ‚Äì The Spirit of Schubert.

Mount was born Edward Reginald Mount, on 4 July 1906. He worked as a designer for various advertising agencies in London in the 1930s, then joined the Ministry of Information at the outbreak of the Second World War. Throughout the war, Mount worked extensively with the designer Eileen Evans. Together, they produced many posters for the Ministry's public awareness and propaganda campaigns, including their renowned anti-venereal disease campaign of 1943‚Äì1944. Other designer colleagues in the Ministry of Information's \\"general division\\" included Maurice V. Bennett and Kenneth Bird, better known as the cartoonist 'Fougasse'. Their work was overseen by the Ministry's studio manager, Edwin Embleton. Some time after 1941, he worked on a series of posters probably intended for export to the Soviet Union (they were accompanied by Russian text). The example pictured shows a hand, representing the merchant navy carrying a Hawker Hurricane to the USSR, to reinforce the Soviet air force. Several of his wartime works depict an anthropomorphised, cartoon-style incendiary bomb, 'Fire-bomb Fritz'. Mount was subsequently a founding member of the Artist Partners agency, which was established in 1950 by the agent Donovan Candler in Lower John Street, Soho, London. Mount continued to work in partnership with Eileen Evans. In the 1950s and 1960s, their 'Mount/Evans studio' became closely associated with the post-war Central Office of Information, producing designs for a wide variety of government agencies. Mount also designed the cinema poster for the British comedy film The Ladykillers. His work is in collections including those of The National Archives, The Science Museum, and the Victoria and Albert Museum. Mount died on 31 January 1979.

The cast of Psycho-Pass 2. From left to right, Ginoza, Hinakawa, Saiga, Tsunemori, Karanomori, Shimotsuki, Kunizuka and Togane. Production I.G's anime series Psycho-Pass features characters designed by manga artist Akira Amano. The anime takes place in a dystopia where citizens are continuously assessed via omnipresent cymatic scans used to determine their mental state, personality, and the probability that they will commit crimes. The result of said reading is labeled one's Psycho-Pass. Throughout its three seasons, viewers follow the members of Unit One (aka Division One) of the Ministry of Welfare Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division supported by the Sibyl System. Creation and design Character designer Akira Amano. Director Naoyoshi Shiotani decided on how to make the series' characters after hearing comments from The Pet Girl of Sakurasou director Atsuko Ishizuka. As that for that series the characters were designed first, Shiotani realized it was the opposite for them. They had to create the setting first and then continue with the characters as they \\"are almost being played by the world.\\" As a result, the cast was designed by manga artist Akira Amano in order to make them balance with the dark atmosphere by having them \\"palatable and very relate- able.\\" The staff also avoided using bright colors that would stand out. These designs were adapted by character designer Kyoji Asano. Akane Tsunemori was created as the most relatable character who would question the setting from the audience's point of view and as the heroine who would come between Shinya Kogami and Shogo Makishima. Her growth in the series from an innocent rookie to a mature and haunted person was one of the staff's main objectives. Whenever an episode included violent scenes where the main characters were involved, the team worked on them to make them memorable. As the series was \\"anti-moe\\" the team decided to avoid having Akane remove her clothes and instead have Kogami do it. The staff also decided to focus more on friendships rather than romantic relationships. Voice actors have also been credited in the making of the series due to how they added traits to the characters. Criminal Investigation Division Season One is seen through the eyes of Akane Tsunemori, a rookie Inspector in charge of solving cases with veteran Inspector Nobuchika Ginoza and their team of Enforcers, most notably Shinya Kogami, a former Inspector seeking vengeance on criminal Shogo Makishima. Tsunemori returns in Season Two as the leader of Unit One, with a re-organized team hunting down criminal Kirito Kamui. Psycho-Pass: The Movie has Tsunemori leaving Japan in order to bring her team to Shambala Float where she runs into her former ally, Kogami, now an expatriate become resistance fighter. The trilogy Sinners of the System tells independent stories that focus on some characters while the Season Three series introduces a new Unit One with Arata Shindo and Kei Mikhail Ignatov as rookie Inspectors who uncover a shadowy organization known as Bifrost. =Season 1=Akane Tsunemori is the 20-year-old main protagonist - lead character and the newly assigned Inspector of Unit One. She passes the exams with the highest score for employment on several public sectors and private corporations. She decides to join the police because it is the only place where no one obtained a score as high as hers, thus she believes she is able to do something there that no one else can. Though initially uncomfortable with her job, Kogami's joy of having somebody who would stop him from killing innocent people motivates her to work and get along with the Enforcers. Her calm demeanor, acceptance of society and will to fight to against conflicts prevent her from becoming a latent criminal despite her experiences. The members from the Sibyl System are attracted by her traits which results in her learning of their true nature as they want to use her to capture Makishima alive with Akane agreeing only if they stop their orders of killing the defecting Kogami. Although she fails, the Sibyl members allow her to live under the condition she does not reveal their truth. In the epilogue, Akane becomes the de facto leader of Unit One. Akane is seen briefing a newly recruited Inspector in the finale. She continues leveraging her position as a trusted Inspector with a personal connection to the Sibyl System until she is arrested before the start of Season 3, forcibly demoting her. She is voiced by Kana Hanazawa in Japanese and by Kate Oxley in English. Shinya Kogami is a 28-year-old Enforcer in Unit One. Formerly an Inspector, his involvement in the Specimen Case caused his Crime Coefficient to rapidly increase to abnormal levels. While investigating the case, Mitsuru Sasayama, the Enforcer that worked under him, was on to the mastermind behind the case until he was killed in the same manner as the victims. Instead of seeking the needed therapy, Shinya became so focused on the case that he was demoted to Enforcer by the Sibyl System, restricting his freedom and limiting his movement to inside the Public Safety Bureau. Despite his violent actions, Kogami feels relaxed when Akane Tsunemori is assigned as his Inspector as he believes he will be a detective rather than a killer under her judgement. As an Enforcer, Kogami takes extensive physical training so that his superiors will not have to kill criminals. The two manage to arrest Makishima but following his escape, Kogami is taken off the case due to the Sibyl not wishing Makishima dead. As a result, Kogami leaves Unit One to hunt down and kill Makishima alone. He ultimately succeeds and is not seen again by his comrades, although in the audio drama After Stories he contacts Akane about how he will stay away from society in order to avoid being detected. He is voiced in Japanese by Tomokazu Seki and in English by Robert McCollum. Nobuchika Ginoza is a veteran Inspector working with Akane. He coordinates all the Enforcers in Unit One. An old friend of Shinya's, his hatred for those with high Crime Coefficients and his zeal to oust them from society came from the inability to stop his former partner from becoming a latent criminal. Although he still holds a certain degree of trust with Shinya, he dislikes Shinya's Enforcer partner Masaoka, his father. His father's demotion to Enforcer causes Ginoza to constantly tell Akane to draw a line between herself and the Enforcers she works with. During the group's search for Makishima, Masaoka sacrifices his life to save his son from Makishima's dynamite and Ginoza loses an arm shortly afterwards. Ginoza's Crime Coefficient rises too high and he is demoted to an Enforcer, mirroring the fates of his father and Kogami. Despite this, Gen Urobuchi wrote Ginoza Nobuchika as a more sympathetic toward both Akane and Kogami for the 2015 movie where he assists the missing Kogami in a fight. In regards to the first Sinners of the System film, Shiotani picked Nobuchika Ginoza and Mika Shimotsuki as the main characters due to their similarities to the protagonists from the first television series, Shinya Kogami and Akane Tsunemori, respectively. Nevertheless, he noted these duo employed a different dynamic from Kogami and Akane while noting how Ginoza has undergone a notable character arc across the previous projects related to Psycho-Pass mainly due to his relationship with Masaoka and Kogami. He is voiced by Kenji Nojima in Japanese and Josh Grelle in English. Tomomi Masaoka is the eldest Enforcer of Unit One. He is a hardworking and honest veteran who guides Akane in learning how the system works in the Public Safety Bureau. As a former detective, his distaste for the Sibyl System's absolute judgment caused his Psycho-Pass to deteriorate, resulting in his demotion to the rank of enforcer. Masaoka is Ginoza's father but their relationship is so dysfunctional the two rarely mention it. Nevertheless, Masaoka still cares for his son and guides him across the series, wishing him not take the path he took. He is voiced by Kinry≈´ Arimoto in Japanese and Jason Douglas in English. Shusei Kagari is an Enforcer of Unit One who was detected as a latent criminal at the age of five. He is always telling jokes and sometimes teases, and flirts with Akane. Although he detests the system, Kagari is also annoyed by the criminals' actions. During Makishima's infiltration, Kagari finds out the true form of the Sibyl System when he is assigned to track one of Makishima's men. He is killed to keep the secret by the chief using Destroy-Decompose Dominator, erasing all traces of him. His fate remains unknown to all of his comrades except Akane as the Sibyl members make it appear he escaped. Akira Ishida voices Kagari in Japanese and Scott Freeman voices him in English. Yayoi Kunizuka is the only female Enforcer of Unit One. She stays calm and collected in the face of even the most brutal crimes. She is a former guitarist in a Punk Rock band who became a latent criminal interacting with a terrorist named Rina. After unwittingly helping the bureau track Rina, the musician she was in love with, she joined the bureau to prevent other people from ending up like Rina. She and Shion have a intimate relationship. She is voiced by Shizuka It≈ç in Japanese and by Lindsay Seidel in English. Shion Karanomori is an analyst in the Public Safety Bureau's General Analysis Division and a latent criminal as well. She provides backup to the Enforcers and Inspectors in their investigation by analyzing the data and evidence sent by them. Being bisexual, Shion is at the moment in a long intimate relationship with Yayoi. Miyuki Sawashiro voices her in Japanese and Lydia Mackay voices her in English. Joshu Kasei is the Chief of the Bureau. She is depicted as an elderly woman who becomes interested in Shogo Makishima's immunity to the Dominators and orders Nobuchika Ginoza not to murder the criminal. When Makishima's assistant Choe Gu-sung tries to expose the truth behind the Sibyl System, Kasei kills him alongside the Enforcer trying to stop him, Shusei Kagari, to stop the leak of information. Kasei is revealed to be a cyborg that the members from the Sybil System use as an avatar with the current user being former criminal . Failing to invite Makishima to Sybil, Kozaburo is killed by the man and replaced with another member of the Sibyl who keeps ordering the Bureau. Kozaburo's backstory is explained in the prequel novel The Monster With No Name. Kasei is voiced by Yoshiko Sakakibara in Japanese and Linda Leonard voices her in English. Mitsuru Sasayama is an Enforcer who works at the MWPSB Unit 1 during flashbacks of the series as well as the light novel The Monster With No Name being dead during the anime series. His sister committed suicide for unknown reasons although Sasayama believes it was his abusive father's sexual assault on her. Sasayama fought against the man during the assault which resulted in him becoming a latent criminal. Despite his cocky and brute personality, Sasayama is a good friend of Kogami. During a case involving gruesome murders, Sasayama finds a lead to the mastermind, Shogo Makishima, but is brutally murdered in the process. The gruesome state of Sasayama's dead body causes Kogami to become a latent criminal as he becomes obsessed with getting revenge for his partner's death. He is voiced by Shintar≈ç Asanuma in Japanese and by Jonathan Brooks in English. =Season 2=Mika Shimotsuki first appeared in season 1's episode 6 as a high school student attending Oso Academy as schoolmates with Rikako Oryo. Two of her friends become Rikako's victims during the story arc. She became a MWPSB inspector in the same team as Akane at the end of season 1. She has a tendency to question and at times argue with Akane when it comes to matters of treating enforcers with professional courtesy (where unlike the latter, she looks down on them) and implementing the proper police procedures. The only person she admires and trusts is Yayoi, who saved her during the events of the first season. In regards to the first Sinners of the system film, Shiotani picked Nobuchika Ginoza and Mika Shimotsuki as the main characters due to their similarities to the protagonists from the first television series, Shinya Kogami and Akane Tsunemori, respectively. Voice actress Ayane Sakura believed Shimotsuki was now more fitting for the role of a heroine thanks to her experience in the second television series where she was the youngest main character. Cherami Leigh voices her in English. In regards to her role in Psycho-Pass 3, Sakura further noted that Shimotsuki would do anything for justice's sake even if it she gets hate as a result. Sakuya Togane is a new Enforcer working with Akane and Mika in season 2. He used to be a therapist and becomes some sort of confidant to Akane. His family is very wealthy.

Kaji enjoyed the character's relationship with Ignatov due to his closer tone when interacting as well as whenever Shindo met characters from previous series. Special attention was given to Shindo's characterization as he depending on how he was written he could come across as an unlikable character based on how he leads conversations while also noting he was still caring. Ubukata wanted the two main characters to be written solely by Fukami. Kei Mikhail Ignatov is a new Inspector of the MWPSB in Unit One introduced in season 3. He is a second-generation Russian immigrant, naturalized Japanese. He is married to another former veteran named Maiko Maya Stronskaya who was blinded in an explosion.

Shogo Makishima is a humanist on the dark side who is obsessed with cruelty, savagery, and all the worst aspects of human nature. A born evangelist, he possesses both uncommon charisma and a true gift for narrative. It is shown that Makishima may be the mastermind behind the many cases the Public Safety Bureau are investigating, including the one that led Kogami to become demoted from Inspector to Enforcer. Despite his murderous intent, his Crime Coefficient levels have never reached dangerous levels, rendering him safe from the Dominator. He himself claims this is because his own mind and body does not consider him killing people and committing crimes to be \\"wrong\\", but rather considers it to be completely \\"normal,\\" which means his Psycho-Pass does not detect any abnormal or illegal behavior to report to the Sibyl System. These traits result in the Sibyl sparing his life to join them but Makishima escapes from them, still wishing to destroy them. He is killed by Kogami after a failed attempt of bioterrorism. He is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai in Japanese while Alex Organ voices him in English. Choe Gu- sung is Shogo Makishima's friend and right-hand man.

However, Shinya Kogami discovers she is the culprit behind several murders and tries to arrest her. Although Oryo manages to escape from Kogami with Choe Gu-sung's help, she is murdered by another of Makishima's underling, Toyohisa Senguji, as her superior no longer sees her useful. She is voiced by Maaya Sakamoto in Japanese while Brina Palencia voices her in English. Her bones were later crafted into smoking pipes by Toyohisa Senguji as one of his many hunting trophies.

Kirito Kamui is a mysterious character who first appears in Season 2 of Psycho- Pass. He seems to know about Akane Tsunemori. It is suggested that he is also like Makishima Shougo, who is cold, cunning, manipulative and cruel, and it is also suggested that, just like Makishima, his hue has a low crime coefficient count which also makes him immune from an enforcer's \\"Dominator.\\" However, unlike Makishima, who uses various criminals as a means of uncovering humanity's repressed desires as a way of spreading chaos and mass hysteria to bring down the Sibyl System, Kamui exploits the flaws within the Sibyl System and uses ordinary people who were either at their limits of their repressed aggression or disenchanted with the world to serve as his pawns to spread chaos and mayhem to bring down the Sibyl System. He is voiced by Ry≈çhei Kimura in Japanese and by Clifford Chapin in English =Bifrost= Bifrost is a secret criminal organization which utilizes and manipulates a highly sophisticated AI secretly housed beneath the NONA Tower.

He is voiced by Takayuki Sugo in Japanese. Reception Publications for anime have given positive response to the series' characters. Rebecca Silverman criticized the characters for often monologuing about their philosophies. The development of Shinya Kogami and Akane Tsunemori has also been well received by Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network due to the impact both have in the series' climax. Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post praised the film the actions of both Kogami and Tsunemori. For the 2015 film, Kotaku reviewer Richard Eisenbeis praised the settings to which Kogami and Tsunemori have to adapt, in contrast to the Sibyl System explored in the first television series. The reviewer also commended the film's climax, in which supporting characters from the television series appear and are more likable compared to their earlier incarnations. Alexandria Hill of Otaku USA praised the first interactions between Kogami and Tsunemori for being action-filled because they contrast with the heavy use of dialogue at the beginning of the film. The supporting cast received similar praise by DVDTalk but still felt some were underwhelming with Shion being the least explored character. Despite being concerned regarding the \\"weak characterization\\" in the series, The Fandom Post's Thomas Zoth praised the relationships of the cast such as Nobuchika Ginoza's and Tomomi Masaoka's. Shogo Makishima also received positive response with praise owing to his orchestration of several crimes but criticism to his immunity to the system by Kotaku's Richard Einsbeis. DVDTalk highly enjoyed his character as \\"When I said Makashima is unique I didn't mean just for the show, but in general. He's a villain that doesn't seem like too much of a threat at the start, but as the series continues, he's the problem for literally everything. He gets shit done. There is no posturing with him and a legitimate sense of danger when his character shows up, not only that, but he's cultured and sophisticated. More shows need villains like this one.\\" His fights against Kogami were also the subject of praise. The development of the Sinners of the System leads was acclaimed for how Production I.G handles their minds and evolve across the story. Shindo and Ignatov's roles were praised by TheCinemaHolic due to how they fit within the supporting characters and brief elements from the past lives imply further depths such as the latter being a victim of xenophobia. Kila from Sequential Planet noted that the usage of new protagonists was a risky move for the franchise due to the popularity of Kogami and Tsunemori. Nevertheless, she believed that both Shindo and Ignatov were likable characters, enjoying the former the most for how his cheerful personality stood in high contrast to the dark narrative. Due to the focus the duo is given, the reviewer believed Shindo and Ignatov managed to be Kogami and Tsunemori's successors. Shindo was also praised by Anime News Network because his mentalist skill adds a new element to investigation and gives the series an air of mystery. Although Anime News Network was disappointed by the lack of closure for the returning cast, the focus given on Shindo and Ignatov earned positive responses for the build up they are given in terms or not whether they will betray one another. As Ignatov is the primary subject of this, the website claims he has a bigger character arc than his best friend. Tsunemori and Kogami won the \\"Noitamina\\" award in an official poll involving characters that appeared in a Noitamina television series. In the 2013 Newtype anime awards, Tsunemori was voted the third-best female character. Kogami's role in Sinners of the System gave him the top place in a 2019 Newtype poll. In a 2019 Anime! Anime! poll, Kogami was tied with Whitebeard from One Piece for eighth place as the character fans wanted to have as their boss. In another poll by Newtype, Kogami was voted the 24th-most-popular male anime character of the 2010s. Critics also focused on the cast' voices. UK Anime Network liked Kana Hanazawa for the stronger tone she provided for her character in comparison to the previous works during the first movie. Takahiro Sakurai was also praised by Rebecca Silverman from Anime News Network for his role as Makishima as he makes a \\"creepily soothing tone.\\" Anime UK News and Rice Digital called Robert McCollum and Kate Oxley the best English actors in the dub.

Egypt has an embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and Malaysia has an embassy in Cairo.  History  Both countries have enjoyed good relations since 1957 due to many Malaysian students studying in Al-Azhar University. In 1979, President Hosni Mubarak paid an official visit to Malaysia (as a vice-President at the time), while in April 2003 the Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad paid a working visit to Egypt. Before the establishment of the Malaysian embassy in 1960, a Malay Association in Egypt was established in 1930 with the headquarters of the association being a gift from the first President of Egypt Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1959. Since then, bilateral relations between the two countries have been good.  Economic relations  Malaysia's main investment in Egypt is in the gas sector which is operated by Petronas. Currently, both countries are in the process to increase economic co-operation. A Malaysian trade centre has also been planned to be opened and a joint trade commission to be set up. An economic co-operation agreement also has been signed between the two countries regarding joint investments and the enhancement of economic relations between the two countries which are constantly developing. In September 2012, Malaysia, through its Foreign Minister, and Egypt, through Mohamed Kamel Amr, agreed to step up bilateral trade and investment, as well as in the field of technology and energy during the United Nations General Assembly in New York City. Both countries also agreed to have exchange visits by their trade ministers. Kamel Amr expressed Egypt's intention to learn from Malaysia with the intention to develop the country's socio-economy and politics. Malaysia is willing to share its experiences in accelerating the country's development. In the private sector, both Malaysia and Egypt have formed specific working groups which would operated to discuss and address any issues of concern to the private sector of both countries, which includes of the halal standards, conformity assessment activities, SME collaboration and trademarks.

Instead of being forced to automatically review the regulations every three years, the EPA would be able to review them on an as needed basis. It would also grant precedence to state financial requirements for hazardous substances over federal requirements. The bill was introduced on June 6, 2013 into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of 2013 would, in section 2, amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to remove a requirement that the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) review and revise regulations declared under such Act at least every three years. In section 4, the bill would amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) to prohibit the President of the United States from declaring any financial responsibility requirement under such Act without first reporting on: :*each facility or class of facilities to be covered by such requirement; :*the development of such requirement, including why the facility or class proposed to be covered by such requirement presents the highest level of risk of injury and why they are not already covered by adequate financial responsibility requirements; :*financial responsibility requirements promulgated by state or other federal agencies for the facility or class to be covered by such proposed requirement; :*the exposure to the Hazardous Substances Superfund for response costs resulting from such proposed covered facilities; and :*the capacity of the financial and credit markets to provide instruments of financial responsibility necessary to meet such requirement. The bill would require the President to update such report to reflect any revision of the facilities or classes of facilities to be covered by a financial responsibility requirement. In section 5, the bill would require an owner or operator of a facility or vessel that has already established evidence of financial responsibility associated with the production, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous substances under state law or any other federal law to establish evidence of financial responsibility under CERCLA only if the President determines that, in the event of a non-permitted release of a hazardous substance that is not a federally permitted release or authorized by a state permit, the existing financial responsibility requirements will not be sufficient to cover likely response costs. It would also require the President, if such a determination is made, to accept evidence of compliance with such other federal or state financial responsibility requirements in lieu of compliance with any portion of the financial responsibility requirements promulgated under such Act to which they correspond. In section 6, the bill would require the owner or operator of each facility that has substances that are listed as United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Chemicals of Interest and that are flammables or explosives in amounts above the screening threshold to notify the state emergency response commission in the state in which the facility is located. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on June 19, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2279 would amend laws concerning the Environmental Protection Agency‚Äôs (EPA‚Äôs) oversight of hazardous substances. The bill would authorize the EPA to review regulations related to solid waste disposal only when necessary instead of every three years as required under current law. The legislation also would remove a long-expired deadline, which the EPA has already met, regarding regulations for the owners and operators of certain types of facilities that produce, transport, treat, store, and dispose of hazardous substances. In addition, the bill would direct that any financial requirements established by the EPA for such owners and operators do not preempt state or other federal agency requirements. The bill also would require the EPA to report to Congress any financial responsibility requirements it intends to establish under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. Finally, H.R. 2279 would require certain facilities holding flammable or explosive materials to report on those holdings to state and local officials. Based on information from the EPA, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) expects that removing the current requirement to review certain regulations every three years would reduce administrative costs. However, some of those savings in administrative expenses would be offset by spending on the new requirement to report to Congress any financial responsibility requirements. The CBO estimates that, on balance, implementing this legislation would not have a significant net impact on spending that is subject to appropriation over the 2014-2018 period. Enacting H.R. 2279 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 2279 contains an intergovernmental and private-sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The bill would require some owners or operators of facilities that store flammable or explosive substances to provide information about the amount of such substances at the facility to state emergency response commissions. Because those owners and operators submit similar information to federal agencies, the CBO estimates that the cost to submit information to state commissions would be minimal. Consequently, the CBO estimates that the costs of the mandate would fall well below the annual thresholds established in the UMRA for intergovernmental and private-sector mandates ($75 million and $150 million in 2013, respectively, adjusted annually for inflation). Procedural history The Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of 2013 was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on June 6, 2013 by Rep. Cory Gardner (R, CO-4). It was referred to the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce, United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy, United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, United States House Energy Subcommittee on Environment and Economy, and the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. The bill passed the Subcommittee on Environment and Economy on June 6, 2013. It was reported (amended) by the Committee on Energy and Commerce on July 30, 2013 alongside House Report 113-179 Part 1. On January 3, 2014, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be on the schedule for the week of January 6, 2014. Debate and discussion The United States Chamber of Commerce released a letter to the House of Representatives on July 30, 2013 announcing its support of H.R. 2279. The letter said that H.R. 2279, H.R. 2318, and H.R. 2226 \\"are well reasoned reform bills aimed at modernizing the Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) and the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).\\" According to the Chamber of Commerce, H.R. 2279 would remove \\"two impractical and unnecessary deadlines\\" and \\"ensure that existing state or federal financial assurance requirements are not preempted by requiring a report to Congress outlining the classes of facilities for which EPA intends to issue financial responsibility requirements, the need for such requirements, and a description of existing state and federal requirements that may already cover each class of facilities.\\" It \\"strongly urges\\" Representatives to vote in favor of the bill. In testimony before the Subcommittee on Environment and Economy, the EPA's Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response stated that the EPA had complied with the existing three year reporting deadline and expressed a commitment \\"to working with the states as we evaluate approaches for addressing financial responsibility. The EPA stated that the removal of the 3 year reporting deadline \\"could potentially reduce a regulatory burden on EPA.\\" The non-profit organization Earthjustice opposed the bill. They argued that the bill \\"eliminates a basis for a lawsuit where public interest and industry plaintiffs are seeking regulatory certainty and a reasonable timeline for the EPA to establish coal ash safeguards.\\" They also accused the bill of \\"weaken[ing] Superfund\\" and creating various financial barriers. The legislative director Andrea Delgado said that \\"the only thing these bills are concerned about protecting is the polluter‚Äôs ability to get away with poisoning communities and leaving their mess behind for someone else to clean up.\\" A coalition of 64 environmental and other interest groups (on both the state and national level) joined together to write a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Environment and the Economy expressing their opposition to this bill and two others. The groups contend that the bill would \\"remove critical federal protections for communities impacted by the use and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes.\\" See also *List of bills in the 113th United States Congress *Solid waste policy in the United States *Resource Conservation and Recovery Act Notes/ReferencesExternal links *Library of Congress - Thomas H.R. 2279 *beta.congress.gov H.R. 2279 *GovTrack.us H.R. 2279 *OpenCongress.org H.R. 2279 *WashingtonWatch.com H.R. 2279 *Congressional Budget Office's report *House Report 113-179 Part 1 Category:Proposed legislation of the 113th United States Congress Category:Waste legislation in the United States Category:Waste management in the United States ","title":"Reducing Excessive Deadline Obligations Act of 2013"},{"id":"41574631","text":"Ahmed Elmi Osman \\"Karaash\\" (, ) is the current Vice President of Puntland.

He favours a highly detailed, realistic style and counts the RSPCA and the National Trust among his British customers. He travels the world to study birds and animals in their natural habitats and his paintings sell internationally. His lifelike paintings and sculpture are the result of months spent immersed in the natural habitat of his wild subjects. In 2015 he turned his focus onto the wildlife living in his garden in north Yorkshire, installing more than 60 surveillance cameras into animal nests and building specific habitats to attract owls, kestrels, stoats & weasels into his two acre garden. The resulting footage, especially of the behaviour of stoats & weasels, has attracted interest from wildlife enthusiasts around the globe and led to appearances on British TV. In 2015 his weasel footage was featured on BBC Springwatch and a BBC Natural Earth documentary on stoats is expected to air in 2019. Robert Fuller writes a popular blog about his wildlife watching experiences and is also a freelance journalist. His latest articles include a feature on his intensive five-year research project into the secret lives of the stoats living in his garden for BBC Wildlife Magazine, published in April 2019 and a piece on stoats & weasels for BBC Countryfile Magazine in May 2018. The artist also writes a monthly column in The Yorkshire Post and the York Evening Press in which he shares the stories behind his paintings. A passionate conservationist, Robert Fuller combines his art with work to preserve the animals and birds to which he owes his livelihood. He uses his paintings to raise funds for conservation and works with conservationists Ryedale Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre to foster owls in the wild. He also helps to rehabilitate stoats & weasels for Mustelid Rescue UK His regular appearances on British television championing wild creatures near his home and gallery on the Yorkshire Wolds have earned him a reputation as an ambassador for the region's wildlife. As such he appeared on ITV's Calendar, Countryfile on 12 April 2011, BBC Look North and BBC The One Show on 16 January 2013. In 2011 Fuller was given an award for bravery by the RSPCA after his quick action when he stumbled upon an armed gang of badger baiters and helped secure a successful conviction. Born in 1972, Fuller moved to Great Givendale, where his father, Richard Fuller, an author and wildlife enthusiast, earned notability for wildlife conservation after winning the Silver Lapwing award for farm conservation. In 2014, Fuller visited the Gal√°pagos Islands and subsequently painted a series of Galapagos wildlife pieces. These were the focus of the summer exhibition at his gallery and then went on display at The Deep (aquarium) in Hull. He also did a series of school visits in Yorkshire with staff from the Galapagos Conservation Trust.http://galapagosconservation.org.uk/ In 2015, Fuller was visited and interviewed by Julian Clary in an episode of Nature Nuts with Julian Clary, a nature show on ITV.

It is the seat of the Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon of Los Angeles along with Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral in Los Angeles. History Cathedral interior Lebanese and Syrian immigrants started to settle along the Mississippi River in St. Louis in the late 19th century. In 1898 they started St. Anthony the Hermit Parish with an Antonine monk, Father George Emmanuel, as their first priest. A group of immigrants from Hadchit, Lebanon, secured property at 923-25 LaSalle Street from the estate of J.G. Choteau and St. Raymond's Church was founded. Father Joseph Karam came from Hadchit the following year to be the parish's first pastor. A parish hall was built in 1951. The present church was completed in 1975. Father Robert Shaheen, who had been at St. Raymond's since 1967, was named bishop of the Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon in 2000. The following year St. Raymond's was named a co-cathedral. A pastoral center was completed in 2002 to serve as the headquarters of the Eparchy. The shrine to Our Lady of St. Louis was dedicated in 2007, and the Maronite Heritage Institute was opened in 2011. On February 27, 2014, the Rev. Wissam Akiki was ordained to the priesthood at St. Raymond Cathedral by Bishop Elias Zaidan. Pope Francis gave his approval for the ordination, which made Akiki the first married Maronite priest to be ordained in the United States in nearly a century.

(2014). It features a guest rap from American rapper French Montana. The song was written by Lopez and Chris Brown in collaboration with the song's producers Antwan \\"Amadeus\\" Thompson, Charles \\"Chizzy\\" Stephens, and Ryan \\"Ryghtous\\" Tedder, while Cory Rooney handled vocal production of the song. A solo version of \\"Same Girl\\" was released on February 4, 2014, as the second promotional single from A.K.A.. An accompanying music video for the solo version of the song was directed by Steve Gomillion and Dennis Leupold in the Castle Hill neighbourhood of The Bronx, Lopez's hometown. Background Lopez tweeted a picture of herself on March 21, 2013 in the recording studio with her long-time collaborator Cory Rooney and American singer Chris Brown. Lopez captioned the picture with the hashtag \\"#SAMEGIRL\\", leading some to believe that it was either a song title or the name of Lopez's upcoming eighth studio album. Several days later, Brown described their collaborations as being \\"fun stuff\\" and \\"party music\\". In April, Lopez commented that she and Brown were \\"in the studio, writing songs and just getting that whole 'Jenny from the Block' flavor back\\". She also revealed that they \\"worked on a bunch of ideas\\" and that they had discussed the possibility of recording a duet for Brown's upcoming sixth studio album, X (2014). In September 2013, Brown revealed the titles of two songs that he had written for Lopez: \\"Emotions\\" and \\"Same Girl\\". On January 13, 2014, during her appearance on The Tonight Show, Lopez shared a 45-second preview of \\"Same Girl\\" and its music video. Two days later, Lopez revealed that the snippet was \\"just something [she] was doing for the fans\\" and that the song was not the first single from her upcoming album, despite some speculation and media reporting that it would be. \\"Same Girl\\" is the second promotional single from A.K.A., after Lopez released the DJ Mustard-produced song \\"Girls\\" on January 22 2014. Like its successor, \\"Girls\\" was remixed to feature a rapper for its inclusion on the album; the album version of \\"Girls\\" features rapper Tyga. Writing and production \\"Same Girl\\" was written by Lopez and Brown in collaboration with the song's producers Antwan \\"Amadeus\\" Thompson, Charles \\"Chizzy\\" Stephens and Ryan \\"Ryghtous\\" Tedder. It is a R&B; song, with \\"J. Lo\\"'s self-assured vocal performance, triumphant brass, vocal samples and trap-tinged hi-hat rolls. The song runs for a duration of three minutes and thirty seconds (3:30). Lopez's vocals were recorded by Michael Glines and Patrick Doyle at Pink's Palace in Hidden Hills, California, with further recorded by Trevor Muzzy at Los Angeles' Conway Recording Studios and Cynthia Daniels at Monk Music Hamptons, New York. Max Unruh recorded French Montana's vicaks ub Atlanta, Georgia at Doppler Studios. He appears courtesy of Bad Boy. Long time Lopez collaborator, Cory Rooney was responsible for overall production while audio mixing was carried out by Jaycen Joshua's The Penna Project at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, California with assistance from Ryan Kaul.Lopez, Jennifer, A.K.A.. Capitol Records (Universal Music Japan). Catalog. UICC 10004. According to Lopez, the song is about \\"getting back to your roots and remembering where you're from\\", returning to the themes of 2002 hit \\"Jenny from the Block\\". \\"Cause I'm on the same grind, no I never changed, I'm loving everyday, I know that I'm the same Jenny from around the way now,\\" Lopez sings. In the chorus, she insists, \\"Cuz in the end I'm still the same girl, same girl.\\" Music video The music video for \\"Same Girl\\" was shot guerrilla style in the Castle Hill neighborhood of The Bronx, Lopez's hometown, during the weekend of December 28, 2013. It was directed by Steve Gomillion and Dennis Leupold, who have worked previously with Lopez on a variety of projects. The music video was described by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News as a \\"love letter\\" to the singer's hometown. The clip features Lopez taking on the subway, singing on a rooftop, walking throughout her neighborhood while greeting locals, taking pictures with fans and dancing. Speaking of Lopez's hair and looks, hair stylist Elsa Canedo said: \\"The looks were very relaxed and real, but we tossed in a few braids to give it some Bronx flavor.\\" The video ends with a note from Lopez that reads: \\"Thank you Andrew Freedman House, Jazz at Lincoln Center Youth Orchestra, and to all my people in the Bronx... You're forever in my heart.\\" On the music video, Lopez said: \\"This was probably the craziest thing I've done in my career of music and movies. I like just being able to do things spontaneously, and not have everything so planned out.\\" Recalling her decision to travel back to the Bronx and ride the subway for the music video, Lopez stated during an interview with Jay Leno: \\"Life can be so complicated and complex for everybody and for me as well and I just felt like, I just wanna get back on the train [...] It really just reminded me of all those amazing memories of riding on that train back and forth to Manhattan and back to the Bronx.\\"  Track listing  Digital promotional single #\\"Same Girl\\" - 3:30 Album track download/stream #\\"Same Girl\\" (featuring French Montana) - 4:06  Credits and personnel  Adapted from album booklet. = Recording locations = *Pink's Palace (Hidden Hills, California) *Conway Recording Studios (Los Angeles, California) *Monk Music Studios (Hamptons, New York) *Doppler Studios (Atlanta, Georgia) (French Montana's vocals, album version only) *Mixing: The Penna Project at Larrabee Sound Studios (North Hollywood, California) = Personnel = *Jennifer Lopez - lead vocals, songwriter *French Montana - featured vocals (album version only) *Chris Brown - songwriter *Cynthia Daniels - additional vocal recording *Patrick Doyle - vocal recording *Michael Glines - vocal recording *Jaycen Joshua - audio mixing *Ryan Kaul - assistant mixing engineer *Trevor Muzzy - additional vocal recording *Cory Rooney - vocal production *Charles \\"Chizzy\\" Stephens III - songwriter, producer *Ryan M. \\"Ryghtous\\" Tedder - songwriter, producer *Antwan \\"Amadeus\\" Thompson - songwriter, producer *Max Unruh - vocal recording (French Montana's vocals, album version only)  Charts  { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - !

Sometimes, the algorithm is classified to the group of the second order learning methods. It follows a quadratic approximation of the previous gradient step and the current gradient, which is expected to be close to the minimum of the loss function, under the assumption that the loss function is locally approximately square, trying to describe it by means of an upwardly open parabola. The minimum is sought in the vertex of the parabola. The procedure requires only local information of the artificial neuron to which it is applied. The k -th approximation step is given by: \\\\Delta^{(k)} \\\\, w_{ij} = \\\\Delta^{(k-1)} \\\\, w_{ij} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{ abla_{ij} \\\\, E^{(k)}}{ abla_{ij} \\\\, E^{(k-1)} - abla_{ij} \\\\, E^{(k)}} \\\\right) Being w_{ij} the neuron j weight of its i input and E is the loss function. The Quickprop algorithm is an implementation of the error backpropagation algorithm, but the network can behave chaotically during the learning phase due to large step sizes.

Point process notation Point processes are mathematical objects that are defined on some underlying mathematical space. Since these processes are often used to represent collections of points randomly scattered in space, time or both, the underlying space is usually d-dimensional Euclidean space denoted here by \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^{ d}, but they can be defined on more abstract mathematical spaces. Point processes have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of point process notation. For example, if a point \\\\textstyle x belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by \\\\textstyle {N}, then this can be written as: : \\\\textstyle x\\\\in {N}, and represents the point process being interpreted as a random set. Alternatively, the number of points of \\\\textstyle {N} located in some Borel set \\\\textstyle B is often written as: : \\\\textstyle {N}(B), which reflects a random measure interpretation for point processes. These two notations are often used in parallel or interchangeably. Definitions=Spherical contact distribution function= The spherical contact distribution function is defined as: : H_s(r)=1-P({N}(b(o,r))=0). where b(o,r) is a ball with radius r centered at the origin o. In other words, spherical contact distribution function is the probability there are no points from the point process located in a hyper- sphere of radius r. =Contact distribution function= The spherical contact distribution function can be generalized for sets other than the (hyper-)sphere in \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^{ d}. For some Borel set \\\\textstyle B with positive volume (or more specifically, Lebesgue measure), the contact distribution function (with respect to \\\\textstyle B) for \\\\textstyle r\\\\geq0 is defined by the equation: : H_B(r)=P({N}(rB)=0). Examples=Poisson point process= For a Poisson point process \\\\textstyle {N} on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda this becomes : H_s(r)=1-e^{-\\\\Lambda(b(o,r))}, which for the homogeneous case becomes : H_s(r)=1-e^{-\\\\lambda b(o,r)}, where \\\\textstyle b(o,r) denotes the volume (or more specifically, the Lebesgue measure) of the ball of radius \\\\textstyle r. In the plane \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^2, this expression simplifies to : H_s(r)=1-e^{-\\\\lambda \\\\pi r^2}. Relationship to other functions=Nearest neighbour function= In general, the spherical contact distribution function and the corresponding nearest neighbour function are not equal. However, these two functions are identical for Poisson point processes. In fact, this characteristic is due to a unique property of Poisson processes and their Palm distributions, which forms part of the result known as the Slivnyak-Mecke or Slivnyak's theorem. =-function= The fact that the spherical distribution function and nearest neighbour function are identical for the Poisson point process can be used to statistically test if point process data appears to be that of a Poisson point process. For example, in spatial statistics the -function is defined for all ‚â• 0 as: : J(r)=\\\\frac{1-D_o(r)}{1-H_s(r)} For a Poisson point process, the function is simply =1, hence why it is used as a non-parametric test for whether data behaves as though it were from a Poisson process. It is, however, thought possible to construct non-Poisson point processes for which =1, but such counterexamples are viewed as somewhat 'artificial' by some and exist for other statistical tests. More generally, -function serves as one way (others include using factorial moment measures) to measure the interaction between points in a point process.

He spent large part of his career as a player in three clubs of the Ukrainian Second League and the Ukrainian First League. In January 2014 he signed 2,5 years deal with Ukrainian Premier League's club FC Hoverla Uzhhorod. After playing just one game in 6 months, he was transferred to Olimpik Donetsk - where he shone, scoring 9 goals and providing 2 assists in all competitions, thus helping the team stay in the Premier League. After one and a half year in Donetsk, he signed for Karpaty Lviv in February 2016. His debut was with an assist against Dinamo Kiev. Nevertheless, after an injury stroke year, he could not score with Karpaty for league games. Due to financial reasons, Kadimyan was amongst the 5 players whom the club couldn't afford, so he was transferred to Zorya Luhansk. Unfortunately, his career in Luhansk was plagued with injuries, thus he only got to play 4 games in his short stay at Zorya, before he was once again transferred to Vorskla Poltava.

The uprising took place during the last phase of the Occupation of Araucan√≠a (1861‚Äì1883) by the Chilean state. The uprising was planned by Mapuche chiefs in March 1881 to be launched in November of the same year. Mapuche support for the uprising was not unanimous, some Mapuche factions sided with the Chileans and others declared themselves neutral. The organizers of the uprising did however succeed in involving Mapuche factions that had not previously been at war with Chile. The 1881 uprising can be considered the climax of the Chilean-Mapuche hostilities during the Occupation of Araucan√≠a. Background Chilean territory and Mapuche groups in Araucan√≠a in 1860 prior to the occupation of Araucan√≠a. In the 19th century Chile experienced a fast territorial expansion. Chile established a colony at the Strait of Magellan in 1843, settled Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue with German immigrants and conquered land from Peru and Bolivia. Later Chile would also annex Easter Island. In this context Araucan√≠a began to be conquered by Chile due to two reasons. First, the Chilean state aimed for territorial continuityPinto 2003, p. 153. and second it remained the sole place for Chilean agriculture to expand.Bengoa 2000, p. 156. Between 1861 and 1871 Chile incorporated several Mapuche territories in Araucan√≠a. In January 1881, having decisively defeated Peru in the battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores, Chile resumed the conquest of Araucan√≠a.Ferrando 1986, p. 547Bengoa 2000, pp. 277‚Äì278. The campaigns of the Argentine Army against Mapuches in the other side of the Andes pushed in 1880 many Mapuches into Araucan√≠a.Bengoa 2000, pp. 273‚Äì274. Pehuenche chief Purr√°n was taken prisoner by the Argentine Army and the Argentine Army penetrated into the valley of Lonquimay which Chile considered part of its legal territory. The fast Argentine advance alarmed Chilean authorities and contributed to the Chilean-Mapuche confrontations of 1881. =Abuses against Mapuches= During the period following the war of 1871 Mapuches in the Chilean occupied parts suffered many abuses and even murder by settlers and Chilean military.Bengoa 2000, pp. 269‚Äì270. One of the most notable cases was the murder of Domingo Mel√≠n in 1880 by elements of the Chilean military.Bengoa 2000, pp. 271‚Äì272. Pre-uprising events In January 1881 the Mapuches of the Malleco zone rose against the Chilean occupation. The town and forts of Traigu√©n, Lumaco and Collipulli were attacked.Bengoa 2000, pp. 275‚Äì276. In response the Chilean state launched a massive campaign not only to defend forts and settlements but also to push the frontier all the way from Malleco River to Caut√≠n River.Ferrando 1986, p. 547 Interior minister Manuel Recabarren was appointed by president An√≠bal Pinto to oversee the process from the town of Angol. Colonel Gregorio Urrutia was summoned from Chilean-occupied Lima to Araucan√≠a to take charge of the Army of the South. Recabarren personally led a large column that established the forts of Quillem, Lautaro and Pillalelb√∫n. In this last place Recabarren was approached by some Mapuche chiefs who asked him to not advance beyond Caut√≠n River. Recabarren answered by telling them that the whole territory was being occupied. At the founding of Temuco in the northern shores of Caut√≠n River Recabarren met chief Venacio Co√±oep√°n and other chiefs from Choll-Choll who also asked him to not advance further. On March 28 Gregorio Urrutia founded the town of Victoria at the shores of Traigu√©n River.Ferrando 1986, p. 548 With the Chilean advance to Caut√≠n River a small mountain range called Cadena de √ëielol remained a focus of Mapuche resistance from where warriors conducted pillaging raids or attacks against vulnerable targets.Ferrando 1986, pp. 550‚Äì551 To end this activity Gregorio Urrutia established a fort in the range. Initially Mapuches offered little resistance to Chilean advance to Caut√≠n River.Bengoa 2000, p. 281. Recabarren believed that Mapuches had not reacted because they expected the foundation of new forts and towns to be preceded by parliaments with Chilean authorities. A wave of Mapuche attacks begun in late February 1881, just a few days after the founding of Temuco in the middle of Mapuche territory.Bengoa 2000, p. 286. The first major attack was against a caravan of carts carrying injured soldiers from Temuco to Fuerte √ëielol. The whole escort of over 40 soldiers and the 96 injured and sick soldiers were killed. In response to these attacks Gregorio Urrutia launched an attack on the Mapuche warriors of Cadena √ëielol burning in his way over 500 rukas and captured over 800 cattle and horses.Bengoa 2000, p. 290. On the other side of the Andes Pehuenches assaulted on March the Argentine outpost of Chos Malal killing the whole garrison of 25‚Äì30 soldiers.Bengoa 2000, p. 293. Planning of the uprising In mid-March Venacio Co√±oep√°n and other Mapuche chiefs met. In the meeting the establishment of new settlements was rejected and the chiefs decided to go to war.Bengoa 2000, p. 287. They set 5 November as the date for their uprising.Bengoa 2000, p. 298. Co√±oep√°n opposed the uprising and according to Gregorio Urrutia he was unaware of date of uprising. Course of the uprising During the uprising several Chilean forts and towns were attacked. =Quillem and Lumaco= A group of Arribanos attacked by mistake on wrong date, November 3, the fort of Quillem. This attack put on alert all Chilean garrisons in Araucan√≠a, settlers took refuge in the forts. On the fifth of November 400 Mapuche warriors, allegedly led by Luis Marileo Colip√≠, attacked the fort of Lumaco.Ferrando 1986, p. 552.Bengoa 2000, p. 297. After Chilean reinforcements arrived to Lumaco Mapuches retreated, and waited to hear news for the uprising elsewhere.Bengoa 2000, p. 299. =Nueva Imperial= In Nueva Imperial suspicious Mapuche movements were noticed on November 6 and telegraphs were sent seeking help from Valdivia and Lebu. The town of Nueva Imperial was attacked on November 7. Defenders fled to the hills and the settlement was effectively destroyed.Bengoa 2000, pp. 304‚Äì305. =The coast= In the coastal region the mission of Puerto Saavedra was attacked. The town of Tolt√©n was defended by the Mapuches of Budi Lake who sided with Chile.Bengoa 2000, p. 300. From Tolt√©n Chile sent 50 militiamen to fight Mapuche rebels. In Tolt√©n as well as in San Jos√© de la Mariquina most women were sent to the city of Valdivia as men prepared for hostilities. Chileans and German settlers dug defensive trenches around San Jos√© de la Mariquina. At the moment of the uprising it was even thought that rebels could reach Valdivia in the south if they succeeded in penetrating San Jos√© de la Mariquina. Despite of having remained outside conflicts in the 19th century the Costinos of the northern coast joined the 1881 uprising.Bengoa 2000, p. 294. Costino warriors, after having contributed to the destruction of Imperial and the engagements at Tolt√©n, advanced north to Arauco.Bengoa 2000, pp. 310‚Äì311. Around Tir√∫a Costino warriors suffered heavy casualties in two engagements with a group of more than 400 armed settlers and campesinos plus some soldiers. =√ëielol and Temuco= The most important engagements were held at the fort of √ëielol and Temuco located at the heart of Araucan√≠a. Venacio Co√±oep√°n and 60 of his warriors were granted refuge in the fort of √ëielol as he had opposed the uprising.Bengoa 2000, p. 313. From there Co√±oep√°n contributed to the defence. The uprising Mapuche succeeded in isolating the fort but were unsuccessful in their attack on November 9. On November 10 a reinforcement of Mapuches coming from Traig√©n was defeated by Chilean troops and the siege of √ëielol was lifted.Bengoa 2000, p. 314. After the Mapuche failure at √ëielol Chilean troops and Co√±oep√°ns warriors were sent to Temuco that was still being under siege.Bengoa 2000, p. 315. Uprising Mapuches numbered 1,400 to 4,000 depending on source. In command of the Chilean forces inside the fort of Temuco was Jos√© M. Garzo. The main engagement at Temuco occurred on November 10 when part of the Chilean troops left the fort of Temuco to chase the warrios from Truf Truf and Tromell.Bengoa 2000, p. 319. The remaining Mapuches unsuccessfully attacked the fort, believing it was almost empty. The defenders used the only cannon in the fort to shoot explosive shells against the attacking Mapuche. About 400 Mapuches were either killed or wounded on November 10 around Temuco.Bengoa 2000, p. 321. Aftermath Uprising Mapuche chiefs were severely punished. When Gregorio Urrutia arrived to Cholchol on November 10 he ordered the construction of a fort in the place of the ruka of chief Ancamilla who had joined the uprising. By doing this Urrutia fulfilled an old vow:Ferrando 1986, p. 553. Ancamilla was taken prisoner and sent to a \\"dungeon with crickets\\" in Poblete. The fort of Cholchol begun to be built on November 22 and gave with time origin to the modern town of Cholchol.Ferrando 1986, p. 554. The rukas of other revolting chiefs were also razed.Ferrando 1986, p. 555. Luis Marileo Colip√≠ who had allegedly attacked Lumaco was stripped of the more than 6,000 ha land he owned near Pur√©n and his brother was taken prisoner and killed. Luis Marileo Colip√≠ managed to escape to Argentina. Little is known about his whereabouts there.

The first convent to be founded in Bremen since the Reformation, it has adopted an ecumenical role in line with the teachings of Saint Bridget. Description The idea of creating a new convent in Bremen was born in 1998 during the Deanery Pastoral Conference (Dekanatspastoralkonferenz) thanks to the inspiration of Maria Elisabeth Hesselblad who had established the new order in 1911 and the synergy between the Abbess General Mother Tekla in Rome and Franz-Josef Bode, Bishop of Osnabr√ºck. Bremen was specifically chosen as the location for Germany's first Bridgettine convent. Designed by Ulrich Tilgner, the convent is located in the Schnoor district of the city on the site of a former bakery. In addition to the chapel and living quarters, there is a guest house with 12 rooms. The nuns take care of the guests and prepare their meals. Seven nuns from Mexico, India, Italy, Poland and Germany currently live in the convent, headed by Sister Giovanna Gonzalez from Mexico. The day begins with morning prayers at 6.15 am and finishes at 8.50 pm with evening prayers. Architecture Set in one of the picturesque streets of the Schnoor, the complex consists of three interconnected structures: the tower-like building overlooking the street with guest rooms, the two-storey nuns' wing set back from the street with a forecourt, and the chapel which is accessed through a small garden. The location of the living quarters between the chapel and the guest accommodation provides for optimal functionality while supporting a life of ora et labora (prayer and work) defined by the order. While the chapel can be reached directly from inside the convent, visitors can enter via the garden (except during daily prayers). In contrast to the vivid terracotta-coloured exterior, the chapel interior is finished in a bright white facing, exuding Scandinavian simplicity. The rear glazed wall takes the form of a cross, reflecting the order's motto: Amor meus crucifixus est (My love is the crucified one). On the occasion of the convent's 10th anniversary, Ulrich Tilgner, the architect, explained that it had been no easy matter to design the building within the of free space, given the heritage restrictions regulating the surroundings and the rather limited funding. Hospitality With 12 rooms accommodating up to 18 guests, the convent welcomes both individuals and groups wishing to escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life.

Early years George-Gabriel de Pellieux was born in Strasbourg, France on 6 September 1842. His father, Captain Jean Honor√© Th√©odore Pellieux, served in the 10th artillery regiment. George-Gabriel de Pellieux entered the military college of Saint Cyr when he was seventeen, and in 1861 became a sub- lieutenant in the infantry. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1864 and captain in 1868. During the Franco-Prussian War (19 July 1870 ‚Äì 10 May 1871) he was aide to General Eug√®ne Arnaudeau and officer attached to the general staff. He was decorated with the Legion of Honor in May 1871, effective 14 October 1870. De Pellieux served in Algeria as aide to General Carteret between 1872 and 1878. In 1880 he was promoted to battalion chief. He was made an officer of the Legion of Honour on 7 February 1882. He was on the staff of General Fran√ßois Auguste Logerot in Tunisia from 1882 to 1886. In 1890 he was promoted to colonel. He was appointed Chief of Staff of the 13th Corps in Clermont- Ferrand in 1892. In 1894 he was promoted to brigadier general. In 1897 de Pellieux was made military commander of the Seine department and provisional commander of Paris. Esterhazy investigation In January 1895 Alfred Dreyfus, an army officer, was found guilty of authoring an anonymous note (bordereau) to the military attach√© of the German embassy in Paris, and was exiled for life to Devil's Island off the coast of French Guiana. Anti- semitism played a role in the court-martial verdict. Later Lieutenant-Colonel Georges Picquart, head of the Intelligence Service, found evidence that Major Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy had written the bordereau, not Dreyfus. In November 1897 de Pellieux was ordered by General Billot to conduct an inquiry into the allegations against Esterhazy. He issued a report after three days in which he stated Esterhazy was not guilty and the Dreyfus case should not be reopened. When more evidence against Esterhazy was revealed, Pellieux was asked to reopen his inquiry. He did not review the new material. Instead he attacked Picquart's credibility and again declared Esterhazy innocent. The minister of war then ordered a formal investigation by Major Ravary. On 31 December 1897 Ravary found there was no basis for the charges against Esterhazy. To close the matter, on 9 January 1898 Esterhazy was arrested, tried and acquitted in two days in a conspicuously biased trial. Esterhazy thanked General de Pellieux for exposing the conspiracy against him. Later events Pellieux testifying at the 7th session of the Zola trial, 1898, by Louis R√©my Sabattier for l'Illustration The well-known writer √âmile Zola became involved in a campaign to exonerate Dreyfus, and wrote a passionate attack on his persecutors in J'Accuse‚Ä¶!, published on 13 January 1898. He wrote, \\"I accuse General de Pellieux and Major Ravary of having led a villainous inquiry, by which I mean a most monstrously one-sided inquiry...\\" In February 1898 Zola was tried for libel against the officers who conducted the Dreyfus court- martial. When Piquart took the stand, de Pellieux attempted to discredit him. He accused Picquart of practicing hypnotism, occultism and table turning, and said he was neurotic. Pellieux called the bordereau \\"absolute proof of Dreyfus's guilt\\". On 23 February 1898 Zola was convicted and given the maximum sentence. Later the verdict was overturned and a fresh trial scheduled. In February 1898 Picquart was cashiered from the army. He was arrested and imprisoned on 13 July 1898. On 30 August 1898 Lieutenant-Colonel Hubert-Joseph Henry admitted to having forged the evidence against Dreyfus. He committed suicide the next day in his cell in the Mont-Val√©rien fortress. In September 1898 the Brisson government decided to allow Dreyfus to appeal his conviction. This caused rage among the nationalists. There were rumors that a military mutiny was being planned, led by General de Pellieux or General √âmile Zurlinden. The Brisson government collapsed on 25 October 1898. Paul D√©roul√®de of the League of Patriots and Jules Gu√©rin of the Anti-Semitic League planned to take advantage of the funeral of President F√©lix Faure on 23 February 1899 to stage a coup, using the escorting cavalcade led by Pellieux as the spearhead. Pellieux first vaguely agreed, then decided against involvement and had himself replaced by General Roget. The attempt fizzled out. After the crisis de Pellieux was reassigned. In the summer of 1899 the court of appeals ordered a new trial for Dreyfus. Before the trial began de Pellieux stood before a council of inquiry to answer charges of collusion with Esterhazy. At the trial Dreyfus was again found guilty, to general surprise. Dreyfus received a Presidential pardon on 19 September 1899, but was denied the right to clear his name in a trial. George Gabriel de Pellieux died on 15 July 1900 in Quimper, Brittany, France.

District 88, which he represented for a single term beginning in 2013, includes part of Washington County. Background A native of Fort Worth, Texas, Alexander holds bachelor's and master's degrees in Psychology from Texas A&M; University in Commerce in northeastern Texas. He and his wife, Patricia, have a son, John Clinton \\"Clint\\" Alexander (born 1976). A daughter, Jessica, another source says \\"Lauren\\", is deceased. Alexander attends the non-denominational Fellowship Bible Church of Northwest Arkansas, located in Rogers. Alexander has held a number of business positions, most recently since 2003 as owner of Alexander & Associates consultants. Since 2011, he has been an advisor to CBI- Sunbelt in Lowell in Benton County, Arkansas. From 2004 to 2011, he was director of campus housing at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in Fayetteville. He is a former security guard and radio host. He is an officer of the Washington County Republican Party and the Spina Bifida Foundation. He is also active in the Washington County Tea Party movement. Alexander has previously resided in Johnson City; New York; Wichita, Kansas; Ames, Iowa, and Stevens Point, Wisconsin. Political life In 2010, Alexander was an unsuccessful Republican candidate for the United States Senate. The Republican nomination and the election went to U.S. Representative John Boozman. In 2012, Alexander was elected in state House District 88, when the incumbent Democrat, Uvalde Lindsey, was instead elected to the Arkansas State Senate. Alexander defeated the Democrat Edwin Sugg (born 1960) of Fayetteville, 5,589 (64.8 percent) to 3,042 (35.2 percent). Alexander served on these House committees: (1) Aging, Children, and Youth, Legislative and Military Affairs, (2) Performance Review, and (3) Revenue & Taxation. In 2013, Alexander co- sponsored a spending cap on the state budget, but the measure failed by two votes on the House floor. He voted to override the vetoes of Democratic Governor Mike Beebe to enact legislation to require photo identification for casting a ballot in Arkansas and to ban abortion after twenty weeks of gestation. He also supported legislation to forbid the inclusion of abortion in the state insurance exchange and to make the death of a fetus a felony in certain cases. He did not vote on a House-approved provision to ban abortion at the point at which fetal heartbeat is detected. Alexander co-sponsored legislation to allow officials of universities and religious institutions carry concealed weapons on campuses and in places of worship, respectively. He voted to reduce the fees for obtaining a concealed-carry permit. He voted to prohibit the governor from regulating firearms during an emergency. He voted against legislation to make the office of prosecuting attorney in Arkansas nonpartisan, but the measure passed, sixty-three to twenty-four. He sponsored the bill, signed by Governor Beebe, to permit the sale of up to five hundred gallons per month of unpasteurized whole milk directly from the farm to consumers. He sponsored failed legislation to prohibit the closure of public schools after a two-year period of declining enrollment. In the 2014 Republican gubernatorial primary, Alexander endorsed the businessman Curtis Coleman, who was handily defeated by the 2006 nominee, former U.S. Representative Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas's 3rd congressional district. Hutchinson then lost the general election to current Governor Mike Beebe. Alexander and Coleman had both run in the 2010 primary for the Senate against John Boozman. Alexander, with 817 votes (42 percent), was unseated in the 2014 Republican primary by Lance Eads of Springdale, who polled 1,137 votes (58 percent).

It is one of three main hubs of the public transport network, with most tram routes and two important bus lines crossing the square. The design of the Domsheide is relatively uneven, characterized by materials such as sandstone, dark red brick, red and yellow clinkers, render, concrete and marble. History In the Middle Ages, the open area south of the cathedral was known as Wulverickesheide (Wulverick Heath), probably from the name of the owner, Wulverick. Later, it was simply known as Heide and from the 16th century as Domsheide (Cathedral Heath), no doubt because the archbishop held court there under a lime tree. The Domsheide belonged to the Dombezirk (Cathedral District), an enclave which until 1803 was under the sovereign and legal control of the Bishop of Bremen, not the Free City of Bremen. The small Cathedral District was originally surrounded by a wall which was torn down in the 11th century. Die Glocke (The Bell), an octagonal bell- shaped building belonging to the cathedral chapter, stood south of the cathedral in the Middle Ages. It was the venue for the meetings of the chapter and, from 1648, for the deliberations of the court. In 1737, a new octagonal building was constructed on the site, coming under the authority of the City of Bremen in 1803. Since 1857, it has belonged to the K√ºnstlerverein (Artists Association). In 1642, the Kapitelhaus (Chapter House) to the south of the cathedral became the Lutheran Grammar School or the Domschule und Athenaeum Bremen. Die Glocke 18th to 20th century View of the square in 1900 In 1733, the area was levelled, fenced in and planted. It was only at the beginning of the 19th century that buildings began to be constructed around the square. In 1856, a monument to Gustav Adolph was erected in the centre of the square but was destroyed for scrap in 1942. The bronze statue was actually intended to be installed in Gothenburg but came back to Bremen after a shipwreck. A second cast was then made for the Swedes. Until 1872, the Debbersche Knaben-Vorschule (a boys primary school) stood on the site where the post office was constructed in 1875. Initially known as the Kaiserliche Oberpostdirektion, the Bremen Main Post Office Building was designed by the Berlin architect Carl Schwatlo (1831‚Äì1884). Kaiserliche Oberpostdirektion In 1895, designed by Ludwig Klingenberg (1840‚Äì1924) in the French Renaissance style, the Bremen Court House (Landgericht Bremen) was completed. It suffered only slight war damage in 1944. Gerichtsgeb√§ude und Untersuchungsgef√§ngnis After a fire in 1915, the old Glocke building was demolished, making way for a new concert hall building with the same name designed by Walter G√∂rig (1885‚Äì1974) and completed in 1928. Its elegant art deco design and excellent acoustics have been praised by a number of artists including Herbert von Karajan, Anne-Sophie Mutter and Gidon Kremer.

Published between 1923 and 1931: in many respects it prefigures his better- known multivolume The Second World War. The World Crisis is analytical and, in some parts, a justification by Churchill of his role in the war. Churchill is reputed to have said about this work that it was \\"not history, but a contribution to history\\".http://www.churchillbooks.com/GuidePDFs/g12.pdf His American biographer William Manchester wrote: \\"His masterpiece is The World Crisis, published over a period of several years, 1923 to 1931, a six-volume, 3,261-page account of the Great War, beginning with its origins in 1911 and ending with its repercussions in the 1920s. Magnificently written, it is enhanced by the presence of the author at the highest councils of war and in the trenches as a battalion commander\\". The British historian Robert Rhodes James writes: \\"For all its pitfalls as history, The World Crisis must surely stand as Churchill‚Äôs masterpiece. After it, anything must appear as anticlimax\\". Rhodes James further comments, \\"Churchill‚Äôs literary work showed a certain decline in the 1930s\\" and that his Marlborough and The History of the English-Speaking Peoples have more of a rhetorical note than The World Crisis. The news he was writing about the war was all over London; he chose The Times for the serial rights rather than the magazine Metropolitan, and with advances from his English and American publishers, he told a guest in 1921 that it was exhilarating to write for half a crown a word (a pound for eight words). The title was settled as The World Crisis rather than Sea Power and the World Crisis. Geoffrey Dawson of The Times had suggested The Great Amphibian. The question of copyright and of quoting confidential government documents was raised by Bonar Law, but other authors, including Fisher, Jellicoe and Kitchener, had already used such documents in writing their own memoirs. Successive volumes were published from 1923 to 1931 by Thornton Butterworth in England and Charles Scribner‚Äôs Sons in America. The first (American) advances enabled him to purchase a new Rolls-Royce in August 1921. In 1922, he had purchased Chartwell, a large house requiring expensive repairs and rebuilding. He justified his position and actions such as on the Dardanelles Campaign. The reception was generally good, but an unnamed colleague said, \\"Winston has written an enormous book about himself, and called it The World Crisis.\\" Arthur Balfour said he was reading Churchill‚Äôs \\"autobiography disguised as a history of the universe\\". Volumes=Volume I: 1911‚Äì1914 (published 1923)= Although nominally starting in 1911 when Churchill became head of the Admiralty, the narrative commences in 1870 with the Franco-Prussian War and ends with Turkey and the Balkans. Churchill comments on German \\"threats of war\\" over recognition by Serbia of the Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1908, which led to talks between the British and French General Staffs over concerted action in the event of war. \\"Algericas was a milestone on the road to Armageddon.\\" (pp. 32‚Äì33) Again over Agadir and the French in Morocco in 1911 Germany was \\"prepared to go to the very edge of the precipice\\", and was surprised by the British reaction (the Mansion House speech of Lloyd George). The design and ordering of the British dreadnought fleet has a chapter, given his involvement. The start of the war in France is followed by the Admiralty and Fisher, and the naval battles of Coronel and the Falklands. The last chapter is on the bombardment of the English \\"open towns\\" of Hartlepool, Scarborough and Whitby by the German battle-cruiser squadron when nearly 500 civilians were killed; there was \\"much indignation at the failure of the Navy\\" but the Navy could not explain for fear of compromising our secret information\\". =Volume II: 1915 (published 1923)= 1915 is described as a \\"year of ill-fortune to the cause of the Allies\\", starting with the Deadlock in the West, mention of Tanks and Smoke, and ending with the Dardanelles campaign (Gallipoli). Churchill complains in his preface that \\"upon me alone among the high authorities concerned (with the Dardanelles) was the penalty inflicted ‚Äì not of loss of office, for that is a petty thing ‚Äì but of interruption and deprivation of control while the fate of the enterprise was still in suspense\\". =Volume III: 1916‚Äì1918 (published 1927, in Parts I and II)= This volume starts with the Allied High Command at the beginning of 1916, and the combatants evenly matched for a prolonged struggle. There are chapters on Verdun, Jutland, the Somme, the Roumanian disaster, the removal of Foch and Joffre after the Somme (Nivelle replacing the latter as French Commander-in-Chief), and American intervention. A chapter on Britain covers the Derby scheme and conscription, the Press and Lloyd George becoming Prime Minister. During the first eighteen months of the events covered, Churchill was out of office and he commanded a battalion in the line at 'Plugstreet' in Flanders early in 1916. Part II of Volume III starts with the invitation of the Prime Minister (Lloyd George) to rejoin the government on 16 July 1917 as either the Ministry of Munitions (which he chose) or the newly created Air Ministry. He says that to the end of 1915 the resources of Britain exceeded the ability to use them; megalomania was a virtue and so was adding one or two noughts to orders. By now, after three years (twenty months) the island was an arsenal with the new national factories beginning to function. But the fighting fronts now absorbed all the production. The Admiralty had not been affected by the munitions crisis of 1915, and Admiralty requirements had priority. France and Italy also had entitlements. The chapters on the fighting fronts start with victory over the U-boats, then the need to save Italy from collapse after the Battle of Caporetto. On the Western Front, Passchendaele, Michael, the Turn of the Tide, the \\"Teutonic Collapse\\" and \\"Victory\\". He ends with \\"Will a new generation in their turn be immolated to square the black accounts of Teuton and Gaul? Will our children bleed and gasp again in devastated lands? Or will there spring from the very fires of conflict that reconciliation of the three giant combatants, which would unite their genius and secure to each in safety and freedom a share in rebuilding the glory of Europe?\\" This volume was originally published in two parts. In subsequent editions these were labelled as Volumes III and IV, So that the original structure of five volumes in six physical books became six volumes. =Volume IV: The Aftermath 1918‚Äì1922 (published 1929)= The Preface says it is mainly concerned with reactions outside the Peace Conference in the \\"halls of Paris and Versailles\\" though there are chapters on the conference, the League of Nations and the Peace Treaties. Churchill indicts the Treaty of Versailles as being too harsh and predicts it will cause future problems. Churchill points out that he went to Paris to discuss Russia not to attend the Peace Conference, though he asked Wilson for a decision on the Russian item when it came up, rather than a continuation of \\"aimless unorganised bloodshed\\" until Wilson returned. There are chapters on Russia, Poland, Ireland, Greece and Turkey, with an Appendix on the Cairo Conference, Iraq, and \\"the Pacification of the Middle East\\". He denies the claim by Wilson‚Äôs assistant Ray Stannard Baker that he was \\"the most militaristic of British leaders\\" and \\"an opponent of the League\\" (of Nations). Rhodes comments that The Aftermath contains \\"the most ferocious denunciations of (Bolshevik) Russia: ... poisoned ... infected ... a plague-bearing Russia ... armed hordes\\". =Volume V: The Eastern Front (published 1931)= The last volume to be published tells (according to the preface) of the conflict between Russia and the two Teutonic empires and the agonies of Central Europe, arising in Vienna. The struggle starts with Bosnia, the murder of the Archduke and the House of Habsburg; and ends with the ruin of all three houses: Romanov, Habsburg and Hohenzollern. After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 Russia withdraws from the war. =Abridged versions= An abridged and revised edition with an additional chapter on the Battle of the Marne and an introduction by Churchill dated 1 July 1930 was published in 1931 by Thornton Butterworth. Clemmie on tour was told by a Singapore bookshop that sales of the abridged edition had \\"gone very well\\". the Daily Herald distributed a cheap two-volume edition printed by Odhams for 3/9d \\"a miracle of mass production\\" (so) \\"for the first time the working people would hear my side of the (Gallipoli) tale\\" but it did not sell. The hoped-for sales of 150,000 copies would have returned over ¬£1000 in royalties. In 2005 an abridgement with an introduction by Martin Gilbert was published by the Free Press, New York. The reception of The World Crisis Reaction was generally favourable, with T. E. Lawrence saying the second volume was far and away the best war-book I‚Äôve yet read and John Maynard Keynes wrote after reading the fourth volume of his gratitude, admiration and envy. Malcolm Muggeridge and Lytton Strachey criticised the concentration on public lives rather than Strachey‚Äôs interest in motivation and private lives. Several military writers in magazine articles criticized some of the opinions and statistics in Volume III. The essays quarreling with some of his statistics and minor points of strategy and tactics were reprinted in a book in 1927.The World Crisis by Winston Churchill: A Criticism (1927; Hutchinson & Co, London) The book introduction said that they go far to destroy any claims Volume III of The World Crisis may have to historical value although they didn‚Äôt amount to much according to Manchester. By 1930 his account in the first three volumes (1923‚Äì29) had been vigorously criticised, but this formidable, brilliant masterpiece had played an important part in the revaluation of his actions (with) the revelation of Churchill‚Äôs part in the origin of the tank, and the narrowness of the margin between triumph and disaster at the Dardanelles evoked some new evaluations. The writing of The World Crisis The World Crisis began as a response to Lord Esher's attack on his actions in 1914 in his book \\"The Tragedy of Lord Kitchener\\", charging that \\"Churchill had slipped away to Belgium on his own while Kitchener was asleep\\". But they soon broadened out into a general multi-volume history. The volumes are a mix of military history, written with Churchill's usual narrative flair, diplomatic and political history, portraits of other political and military figures, and personal memoir, written in a colourful manner. Churchill was a prolific writer, particularly (as he did not have a private income) when out of Parliament (1922‚Äì24), or out of office so needed to supplement a backbench MPs salary. The Churchills literally \\"lived from book to book, and from one article to the next\\". In his two years out of parliament he edited collections of his speeches and earned ¬£13,200 from 33 articles in magazines: the Empire Review, Pearson‚Äôs Magazine, the Daily Chronicle, the Strand Magazine, Nash‚Äôs Pall Mall, English Life, the Sunday Chronicle, John Bull, the Weekly Despatch, the Daily Mail and Cosmopolitan in America. The British editions of The World Crisis sold 80,551 copies, and brought him ¬£58,846 from royalties which were between 30% and 33%. He purchased his house \\"Chartwell\\" in 1922 from ¬£20,000 of The World Crisis royalties and a small legacy from a cousin Lord Herbert Vane-Tempest. \\"Chartwell\\" was purchased for ¬£5,000, but with dry rot the rebuilding cost ¬£18,000. The American edition of The World Crisis earned him $20,633.10 after deducting Curtis Brown‚Äôs commissions. Manchester said he wrote \\"superb copy\\" hence was one of the world‚Äôs most highly paid writers. In 1931 his writing income was ¬£33,500. The Times serialised four of the five volumes of The World Crisis, and excerpts also appeared in the Sunday Chronicle. In 1923 he noted to his wife \\"I have 8 articles to write as soon as the book is finished: ¬£500 ¬£400 & ¬£200. We shall not starve\\"; it was not to be finished for eight more years, and ran to five thick volumes (with Volume III published in two parts) and 2,517 pages. The last three volumes were produced while he was a busy cabinet minister. He originally conceived of a two-volume work of his years in the Admiralty, saying in a 1915 letter to Clementine \\"Someday I shd like the truth to be known\\". He had filed memos, documents and letters, and in 1920 had them set in type by Sir Frederick Macmillan, so that they were readily usable and could be pasted onto large sheets of paper with written comments and transition sections added. He had Admiral Henry Jackson check his facts and Eddie Marsh his grammar and spelling. Desmond Morton assisted from 1929. Later in the 1930s his assistants included John Wheldon, Maurice Ashley and William Deakin. However, despite the checking by Admiral Jackson, the evidence indicates that Churchill \\"initiated the Dardanelles project, and pushed it forward with vigour, overruling or ignoring the doubts and criticisms of his service advisors. This course of action may have been justified, but it was a very different course to that described in The World Crisis\\". Churchill in the First World War and its aftermath Churchill was First Lord of the Admiralty from October 1911 to May 1915. From May 1915, he had the sinecure of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and so was in the Cabinet and on the Dardanelles Committee. In November 1915, he resigned from the government. Until June 1916, he was on active service on the Western Front as a major and then as a lieutenant-colonel. He then resumed his active political career in the House of Commons but was not initially included in Lloyd George's Coalition Government in December 1916. From June 1917 to December 1918, he was Minister of Munitions but not a member of the small War Cabinet. From January 1919 to February 1921 (normal Cabinet Government having been resumed), he was Secretary of State for War and Air. He was involved in demobilization of the Army (1919), Intervention in Russia (1919) and the Irish crisis (1919-1919). For the remainder of Lloyd George's Coalition Government, until October 1922, he was Secretary of State for the Colonies. He was in government for the whole period, except in 1915 to 1917, and had taken notes and documents for his writing. The three actions for which he was most criticised were the Defence of Antwerp in 1914, the Dardanelles campaign in 1915 and the intervention in Russia in 1919 and 1920. Churchill had arrived in Antwerp on 3 October 1914, arriving in \\"undress Trinity House uniform\\". The Government had despatched the Royal Marine Brigade to Antwerp, arriving there on 4 October. Churchill had the 1st and 2nd Naval Brigades of the Royal Naval Division, which he had established, also sent there. They were mainly untrained naval recruits, and he was criticised when over 2,500 were interned or became casualties, but they had prolonged the defence of Antwerp for several days, perhaps a week, and they almost certainly enabled Dunkirk and Calais to be secured. The Dardanelles campaign, which was originally to be a naval assault, and Intervention against the Bolshevist forces in Russia were both supported halfheartedly by Cabinet and the often-absent Prime Minister (Lloyd George in the latter case). Cabinet was reluctant to make a firm decision, and only minimal shipping was supplied for supplies to Russia, but more shipping was available. In both cases, a \\"single-minded man\\" was able to carry his views further than in more normal conditions.

Lebanon-St. Peter Cathedral is a Maronite Catholic cathedral located in Los Angeles, California, United States. It is the seat of the Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon of Los Angeles along with St. Raymond Cathedral in St. Louis, Missouri. History Monsignor Joseph Daher organized Maronite Catholics into a parish in 1923 named Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon. Mass was celebrated in a house at Warren and Brooklyn Avenues that was purchased by the congregation. Father Paul Meouchi became pastor in 1926 and had a church, hall and rectory built on the property. He was elected the Maronite bishop of Tyre in 1934 before becoming Patriarch of Antioch, a Cardinal, and head of the Maronite Church. Father John Chedid became pastor in 1956. By the 1960s a new church building was needed. On August 2, 1966, the parish decided to accept the offer of St. Peters Roman Catholic Church, on the border with Beverly Hills and Hollywood, which had been made by Cardinal James Francis McIntyre of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. A parish hall was completed in 1969. Father Chedid was named a Chaplain of His Holiness, with the title Monsignor, in 1969, a Maronite Chorbishop in 1978 and the Auxiliary Bishop of the Eparchy of St. Maron of Brooklyn in 1980. The Eparchy of Our Lady of Lebanon of Los Angeles was created by Pope John Paul II on June 23, 1994, and Our Lady of Mt. Lebanon-St. Peter was chosen to serve as the cathedral. Bishop Chedid was appointed the bishop of the eparchy. The cathedral was damaged in a fire on January 6, 1996. It was refurbished, and at the same time the Chancery building was added.

The human population is not high. Geography The Southern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic is a transitional region between the equatorial Congolian forests region to the north and the woodlands and savannas of the Zambezian region to the south. The Central Congolian lowland forests lie to the north, west of the Congo River, and the Northeastern Congolian lowland forests are east of the Congo.

Important climatic shifts have occurred more than 20 times in less than 10 million years. Plants and animals adapt, change, and go extinct with any climatic oscillation. Widespread and immensely resilient organisms that lived through in islands of habitat and accustomed to spatial fluidity were favored. During dry periods, savanna communities breached far into the Congo Basin. The relatively moist riparian forests become detached from one another and compose forest island localities in the savanna matrix.

Background In 1996, a group of association executives chartered the ICAC as a not-for-profit organization with the purpose of evaluating certification programs at an affordable rate that smaller organizations can afford. In order to accomplish this mission, the organization requires a substantial commitment of volunteer time from accredited associations, keeping administrative overhead to a minimum. Over the years the ICAC has also developed a comprehensive process to evaluate certification programs against international standards designed not only to confirm the association is complying with industry norms, but also help correct any minor administrative concerns uncovered during the evaluation. In this way, accredited organizations can both improve existing certification programs as well as demonstrate to the public that their programs comply with industry best practices. By accrediting certification programs, the public and the industries represented have an additional level of assurance, knowing that the program has been reviewed by a neutral third party and been found to meet or exceed reasonable levels of record keeping, security, objectivity, and professionalism. Guidelines The ICAC itself operates under the international guidelines established as a quality assurance regime for accreditation bodies (ISO/IEC 17011 ‚Äì Conformity Assessment: General Requirements for Accreditation Bodies Accrediting Conformity Assessment Bodies), and has established assessment tools and processes that assure certification bodies are in compliance with ISO/IEC 17024 (2012): Conformity Assessment ‚Äì General Requirements for Bodies Operating Certification of Persons. Accredited programs To date, ICAC has reviewed and accredited nearly 100 certification programs, including those listed below. ;Electronics Technicians Association, International (ETA International) Programs: * Over 80 accredited certifications in: * Basic Electronics * Biomedical * Communications * Fiber Optics & Data Cabling * Information Technology * Photonics & Precision Optics * Renewable Energy * Smart Home * Workforce Readiness ;National Association of Radio & Telecommunications Engineers, Inc.

Lewis added, \\"To a fellow who has spent months guarding an outpost in the South Seas, Iceland or Africa a cheery greeting from a favorite comedian, a song hit direct from Broadway, or the beating rhythm of a hot band, mean a tie with the home to which he hopes soon to return.Lewis, Lt.

This Is the American Forces Network: The Anglo-American Battle of the Air Waves in World War II. Praeger Publishers. The revised format was that of a variety show, mixing music, comedy and exchanges between entertainers. Each installment of Mail Call began in an easily recognizable way, as quoted by Morley: > Mail Call from the United States of America. Stand by Americans. Here's Mail > Call, one big package of words and music and laughter delivered to you by > the stars from whom you want to hear in answer to the requests you send to > the Armed Forces Radio Service in Los Angeles, USA. Like the entertainers who appeared on the program, the announcers who spoke that introduction were familiar to the troops because of their popularity in radio. They included Ken Carpenter, Harry von Zell and Don Wilson.  European exposure and audience  Although production of Mail Call and other AFRS programs was done in the United States, radio facilities in other countries were needed to broadcast the programs. A story in the April 1944 issue of Radio News noted: > American soldiers in the European Theatre of Operations have their own > private radio network now -- thanks to the British Broadcasting Corporation > and the U.S. Army Signal Corps. ...

The people of Great Britain not only provided broadcasting facilities through the BBC, but also listened to Mail Call and other programs broadcast by AFRS. An article in the July 9, 1945, issue of Broadcasting magazine headlined \\"U.S. Programs Are Popular in Britain\\" cited a survey in Great Britain that \\"showed that 20,000,000 adults in Britain had recently listened to one or more of the seven programs produced in the United States and rebroadcast in Britain.\\" Two AFRS programs, Command Performance and Mail Call, were among those seven, with listening percentages of 27.5 and 22.9, respectively.Broadcasting. July 9, 1945. U.S. Programs Are Popular In Britain. p. 74 A bonus for the artists who donated their time and effort to performing on Mail Call and other AFRS programs was increased international exposure. Author Donna Halper wrote: \\"Many of the popular female vocalists and comedians, along with some of the most popular men, were now internationally famous\\" as a result of exposure on Command Performance and Mail Call. She added, \\"Suddenly, American music was exposed to an entirely new audience, since it was not just the soldiers who listened to AFRS.\\"Halper, Donna L.

End of the broadcast  After World War II ended, the need for shows like Mail Call diminished, resulting in changes in AFRS programming. Broadcasting magazine reported that the end for Mail Call and eight \\"other service radio shows requiring outside talent\\" came in 1950 when the \\"AFRS budget was ... cut by $153,000 by the Secretary of Defense.\\" Other shows discontinued in the move were as follows Command Performance, Redd Harper Hollywood Roundup, GI Jive, Jill's Juke Box, Chiquita, Personal Album, Lucky Grab Bag and Bob Carleton Show.Broadcasting.

Childhood  Anne Messel was born 8 February 1902, in London, the second child and only daughter of Maud (daughter of Edward Linley Sambourne) and Leonard Messel. She was the sister of Linley Messel (1899‚Äì1971) and celebrated theatrical designer Oliver Messel (1904‚Äì1978). She grew up in Sussex, close to the home of her grandparents at Nymans. She was educated at home; needlework and gardening were among her early interests. The presence of illustrations in surviving family letters and diaries reveals that she also had some artistic talent.  Marriage and children  Anne made her debut in society in 1922. Her poise and fashion sense were praised by society columnists in newspapers such as the Daily Express and Evening News. Her friends included Edward James and Tilly Losch, Zita Jungman, and society photographer Cecil Beaton. She married Ronald Armstrong-Jones on 22 July 1925 and they were divorced in 1934. They had two children: *Susan Anne Armstrong- Jones (12 February 1927 ‚Äì May 1986), who married John Vesey, 6th Viscount de Vesci *Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon (7 March 1930 ‚Äì 13 January 2017), who married Princess Margaret Anne married Michael Parsons, 6th Earl of Rosse, on 19 September 1935. Rosse had extensive estates in Ireland and was nicknamed \\"The Adonis of the Peerage\\". They had two sons and five grandchildren: *Brendan Parsons, 7th Earl of Rosse (born 21 October 1936), who married Alison Cooke-Hurle on 15 October 1966 *Hon. Desmond Oliver Martin Parsons (23 December 1938 ‚Äì 16 July 2010), who married Aline Edwina Macdonald The couple travelled extensively, and Anne was present at the coronations of both King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II. Nymans In 1947, the house at Nymans was badly damaged by fire, and the countess travelled to Staplefield to help. Her parents vacated the house and bought Holmsted Manor nearby as their new home. The earl and countess continued to use the house, following repairs, and it passed to the National Trust on her father's death in 1953. After the earl's death in 1979, the countess returned to live at Nymans and retained some responsibility for the appearance of the gardens.  The Victorian Society  At a Guy Fawkes night party in 1957, inspired by her house at 18 Stafford Terrace and the reaction of its 32 visitors, Anne, Countess of Rosse proposed founding a Victorian Society to encourage the preservation and appreciation of what was then unfashionable art and architecture. A handful of enthusiasts, including Sir John Betjeman and Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, agreed to support the cause. The Victorian Society was founded at 18 Stafford Terrace in February 1958 with the aim of preserving Victorian and Edwardian architecture and encouraging research into the art and history of the period.

Announced in January 2014, the game was released worldwide for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2015. Evolve uses an asymmetrical multiplayer structure, where five players‚Äîfour playing as hunters and one as the monster‚Äîbattle against each other on an industrialized alien planet called Shear. The hunters' gameplay is based on the first-person shooter design, while the monsters are controlled from a third-person perspective. The hunters' goal is to eliminate the monster, while the monster's goal is to consume wildlife and evolve to make themselves stronger before either eliminating the hunters, or successfully destroy the objective. Evolve was Turtle Rock Studios' first major project after the company split from Valve in 2011. The concept for Evolve existed prior to the development of their previous game, Left 4 Dead. Inspired by hunting games such as Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter, the idea is to have prey that can strike back at the hunters. The monster design was originally intended to be esoteric but was later toned down. Turtle Rock found difficulty when seeking publishers that could provide funding and marketing for the game. THQ was originally set to serve as the game's publisher, but the rights to the franchise and publishing duties were transferred to Take-Two Interactive after THQ filed for bankruptcy in late 2012. Prior to release, Evolve received a largely positive reception and won the Best of Show Awards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 and Gamescom 2014. Upon release, the game received positive reviews from critics, with praise mostly directed to the game's asymmetrical structure, controls, and designs. However, it received criticism for its progression system and light narrative, gameplay, as well as a large amount of downloadable content prepared. Evolve was a commercial success, although the player base significantly dwindled shortly after release. The game had briefly transitioned to become a free-to-play title known as Evolve Stage 2 before 2K Games shut down the game's dedicated servers in September 2018. Plot The game is set in a fictional future where humans have successfully discovered ways to survive outside Earth and have begun colonizing other planets. Humans arrived at Shear, a distant planet located in the \\"Far Arm\\" of space, and began creating colonies and industrial factories. As the colonisation progressed, humans began to meet resistance from alien life-forms, known as Monsters, that had the ability to evolve by consuming local wildlife. As the Monsters destroyed the colonies on Shear, a former \\"planet tamer\\" named William Cabot was brought out of retirement to deal with the threat and to evacuate the remaining colonists from Shear. Cabot assembled a team of Hunters to eliminate the Monsters and protect their communities. Gameplay Evolve is an action video game with a focus on both co-operative, and competitive, multiplayer gameplay. The game adapts a '4v1' asymmetrical structure where four players take control of the Hunters, while the fifth player controls the Monster. The Hunters' main objective is to track and hunt the Monster in a limited amount of time, while the Monster's goal is to evolve and make themselves more powerful. In the beginning of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to the Monster so that they can have enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where the Monster started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack can also be used to dodge attacks performed by the monster, though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track the monster, as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for the Monster. The Monster needs to grow stronger in order to fight the Hunters by hunting and killing other local wildlife in order to gain experience points. When it gains enough experience, the Monster can evolve. Through evolution, the Monster's health bar is extended and refilled, and more abilities are available to the Monster, which makes it easier to kill the Hunters. However, the Monster is vulnerable during its evolution, and if caught by the hunters, the process is disrupted. The Monster can also enter a \\"stealth mode\\", allowing it to avoid detection by wildlife and Hunters. Evolve features five different modes: Hunt, Nest, Rescue, Defend and Arena, which have different objectives for both the Hunters and the Monster. Evolve provides two different structures to these game modes: Quick Play, which starts a single playthrough match; and Evacuation, which serves as a five-match, multiplayer story mode. In Evacuation, each match gives the winning side an advantage in the next map, such as having a toxic gas the Monster is immune to, or autonomous gun turrets to assist the Hunters. The Evacuation mode ends with a 'Defend' match. Evolve also features an Observer Mode, allowing players to watch a match without playing in the match. The spectator can jump between cameras and view the match from both the Hunters' and the Monster's perspectives. Normally, five players play in a standard round of Evolve, with four Hunters fighting one Monster. Playing with fewer than five players, including single player, is possible in all modes due to computer-controlled bots. These bots can control up to four of the characters, allowing between one and four human players in any game mode. Players can also switch to play as another class instantly in a single-player match. =Hunters= Evolve features a total of 20 different human characters split into four classes, each class containing 5 characters. Each class has different skills and abilities, and players are required to cooperate with each other in a match. Players unlock new characters as they progress through the game, e.g. the fourth Assault character will be unlocked if the player has upgraded the previous three Assault characters. The Hunters class features first-person gameplay. The ammunition of their weapons is automatically refilled when not in use, and iron sights are used in-game. Evolve does not allow multiple players to play as the same class in a match. Gameplay variations are also present within the characters in the same class. * Assault: The Assault-class characters serve as the main \\"damage dealers\\" to the Monster. They are equipped with heavy weapons such as shotguns, rocket launchers, flame throwers, and mini-guns. Assault-class characters also have shields for their own protection and land mines. The shield provides temporary invulnerability to damage. Starting from stage 2, the invulnerability ability was changed to Defense Matrix, a new ability that reduces damages when being attacked by enemies. * Trapper: The Trapper-class characters can use their gear to track the Monster's movements. As the Monster occasionally scatters local wildlife, such as birds, the trapper can use these 'signs' to find the location of the monster. Trappers also have other abilities and tools that can slow the movements of the Monster. Following the release of the Stage 2 alpha, all hunters gained the ability to use the mobile arena and the trappers gained the plant scanner ability, similar to the monster's smell. * Support: The Support-class characters provide backup to the other characters. They are equipped with a damage dealing weapon, such as a laser cutter, or a shield that can be used to protect other Hunters. They also have the ability to provide temporary shields for nearby allies. In Stage 2, they gain the ability to charge the shields of their companions hunters. * Medic: The Medic-class characters' main technique is replenishing the health of team members. Medics are also equipped with a damage dealing weapon. Some Medics also have the abilities to revive teammates that are incapacitated or killed by the Monster. According to Evolves concept artist, those playing as Medics should stay back and avoid direct combat with the Monster, and only use their abilities when necessary. Starting from the release of Stage 2, changes were made to the hunter classes. Every class now possesses the ability to deploy a force field, an ability once exclusive to the Trapper class. It can be used to limit the Monster's movement to a small area. The ability's cooldown time decreases when the hunters deal enough damage to the monster. Starting from Stage 2, the health of all hunters regenerate if they manage to avoid damage, and they no longer have to rely on the Medic class. =Monsters= There are a total of five Monsters featured in Evolve. Similar to the Hunters, players need to inflict a certain amount of damage before unlocking a new Monster. The five different Monster-types also have different abilities, both offensive and defensive. Players control the Monster from a third-person perspective, and it features gameplay similar to an action game, unlike the Hunters. More abilities are given to a Monster after its evolution. Gameplay mechanics do not change much after the release of Stage 2, but monsters are made more powerful. They are given more health, stamina, armor, and skill points to unlock all abilities. Cooldown time abilities also shortened and recharge rate becomes significantly faster. * Goliath: The Goliath is the starter Monster, available to all players. It has the strongest armor and health among the monsters. Goliath can charge and throw large rocks at Hunters, which can temporarily stun them, as well as perform attacks, such as breathing fire and \\"Leap Smash\\". In order to navigate the environment, the Goliath can leap over obstacles. * Kraken: The Kraken is the second monster players unlock. The Kraken is electricity-based, and can unleash attacks such as \\"Lightning Strike\\", \\"Vortex\\" and \\"Electrical Blast\\". The Kraken can also set up traps such as mines in a map to hurt the Hunters. The Kraken can temporarily ascend into the air to both escape from the hunters and move past some obstacles. * Wraith: The Wraith is the third unlockable monster. The Wraith can warp towards a Hunter and unleash a blast, dealing damage to the Hunters. They can also launch a small arena within a map which grants them bonus armor and strength. The Wraith also has the ability to teleport between places and kidnap a Hunter whilst in a group. * Behemoth: The Behemoth is a DLC character. The Behemoth can unleash abilities such as \\"Lava Bomb\\" and \\"Fissure\\", which can stun Hunters. The Behemoth can also create \\"Rock Wall\\", which can isolate a Hunter from their companions. * Gorgon: The Gorgon is also a DLC character. The Gorgon has abilities such as \\"Traversal\\", the ability to launch spider webs to move around the map, \\"Acid Spit\\", and \\"Web Snare\\" which can slow down Hunters. The Gorgon also has two abilities that use a 'second Monster' called \\"Mimic\\", which allows the player to control a clone-version of Gorgon that explodes to deal damage to Hunters; and \\"Spider Trap\\", which sends a smaller version of itself to trap Hunters. Development=Origin= Evolve was developed by Turtle Rock Studios. Evolves creative director, Phil Robb, and lead designer, Chris Ashton, are the co-founders of Turtle Rock Studios alongside Michael Booth. The team had a heritage of developing competitive multiplayer games, such as Valve's Counter-Strike series and the Left 4 Dead series. According to Robb, the team wanted to build a co- operative, multiplayer game because it gave the team a chance to play with their family and friends together, instead of against each other, and found it offered a more enjoyable experience than competitive multiplayer games. The concept for Evolve was completed in 2005, before the development of the first Left 4 Dead game. However, the Evolve project was put on hold, as Turtle Rock thought that the technology at that time was not advanced enough to handle the game's design. Turtle Rock Studios merged into Valve in early 2008 but split away later the same year. When the company reestablished, it had only 13 staff members. As a new company, Turtle Rock Studios hoped to make use of the popularity of the Left 4 Dead franchise to create something ambitious and massive before people forgot about the company. When eighth generation video game consoles were released, the team realized they could create almost anything they wanted. They reviewed some of their previous projects and eventually chose Evolve, which seemed to be the most \\"straightforward\\" concept. The team also considered the new project as their \\"proving ground\\", a project that could show their ability to build a large-scale game beyond providing assistance to Valve. The development of Evolve officially began in early 2011. =Design= Evolve was inspired by hunting games Cabela's Big Game Hunter and Deer Hunter. Members of Turtle Rock Studios, including Robb and Ashton, thought that the gameplay of these hunting games, such as animal- tracking, was seldom incorporated in an action game. As a result, they came up with the original concept of Evolve in which, if players failed at hunting the animals, they could be attacked by their targets. Instead of typical big game animals such as elephants and lions, the team imagined it to be a \\"King Kong\\", which changed to an alien monster. The team picked a sci-fi setting, allowing them to add creative and unrealistic things into the game. The team also took the concept of boss battles, and expanded upon it by using the concept as a key idea when developing Evolve. The team envisioned Evolve as a video game version of Predator. The goal of Evolve was to create an experience that was new to video game players. While Evolve carried some game mechanics from Left 4 Dead, others were discarded. The team originally thought that it could be added to the artificial intelligence system of Evolves wildlife, but was later scrapped. They thought that the core experience offered by Evolve should be tracking and hunting the monster, instead of getting attacked by wildlife constantly. The team also thought that it would become an irritation if they added too many complex mechanics for the wildlife. The developer also intentionally chose not to make Evolve action-packed all the time, and introduced segments that would require players to slow down and track the Monster. Robb explained that the design team wanted to create a contrast, so that players could appreciate the action and chaotic moments after experiencing the less exciting segments. When the design team was deciding on the number of Hunters in a match, they chose four as they believed it was the optimal number in a team, as players would not lose track of the stats and health of other players. It also allowed the players to work collaboratively with each other, so that no character would get left behind, or neglected, by the team. From the Monster's perspective, the design team thought that having four Hunters engaging in combat with the Monster would provide a challenge for the Monster, as they could find difficulties in keeping track of the Hunters, and this would make a match feel more balanced. The Hunter team was divided into several different classes because it \\"makes senses\\" according to Turtle Rock. In order to showcase the features and abilities of different classes, each class has different variations, in both appearances and costume colors. It was designed to make characters more recognizable and memorable. Another reason was that the design team wanted the Monster to adapt and use different strategies when dealing with different Hunters. Turtle Rock considered this a way to effectively extend Evolves replayability and would add more variety to the gameplay. There were originally four Hunter characters in Evolve, but after the design team experimented with the free-to-play model, the list of characters was expanded to 16. The titular \\"Evolve\\" game mechanic was inspired by the \\"bomb planting\\" mode from the Counter-Strike series. The Monsters started out as a relatively weak creature that could be defeated easily, but becomes stronger and gains more skills as it evolves. Early playtesters complained about the game mechanic, as they thought that this would bring an unfair disadvantage to the Hunters, since they do not \\"evolve\\" like the Monster. However, the design team still chose to maintain the game mechanic, as they thought that it would create an engaging experience. Ashton added that such game mechanics can create a \\"turning the tables\\" feeling for the Hunters, and that he thought that the sudden change in strategy ‚Äì from offensive to defensive ‚Äì could help deliver a dynamic experience to the players. The Monster was originally intended to play from a first-person perspective but was later shifted to a third-person perspective during development because the first-person control system was considered to be clumsy and confusing, and that the first person perspective took control away from players. The design team considered designing third-person gameplay a challenge, as they had no prior experience in creating such games. On the other hand, the design team implemented the first-person gameplay for the Hunters when Evolves development started. The design team thought that the first-person perspective would provide a sense of tension as players would not be able to see what was behind them. Evolves environments are based on Earth's as the design team wanted to create a world that felt believable for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, the design team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The design team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The design team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The design team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far Cry and Crysis. As the design team felt that Far Cry and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed. As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, the design team put less time and focus into developing Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team thought that it would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters. Concept art of Evolves \\"Goliath\\" Monster. Evolve features a Cthulhu-inspired artstyle. As a result, much of the wildlife were intentionally designed to feature tentacles. Robb had previously drawn a lot of esoteric monster designs but the publisher, THQ at the time, thought that while the designs looked unique, they would not benefit the game. The team then began developing \\"marketing monsters\\" with a more stereotypical design. The original Goliath was based on a lobster, but changed to \\"a hybrid between King Kong and Godzilla\\", according to Evolves producer, Robb. Anthropological design features were later added to Goliath's design to make the players feel more connected to the Monsters, especially when they are killed in the game. For the second monster, Kraken, the team wanted to create an electricity-based creature and looked at marine creatures, such as eels, for inspiration. The third monster, Wraith, was inspired by sirens. The team noted that the key feature of this monster was its abduction ability, which the design team felt would capture the tense and exciting moments of classic monster movies. The team had designed more than three monsters, but many of them were dropped due to technical issues with Evolves artificial intelligence system, abilities that were deemed to be too powerful, and animation problems. Jason Graves is the composer for the game. Evolves soundtrack was composed by Jason Graves and Lustmord. Graves composed the Monsters' soundtracks, while Lustmord composed the Hunters' soundtracks. According to Graves, much of the music was inspired by the Aliens vs. Predator series. Graves stated that he intentionally chose not to use an orchestra- based style for the music, instead, Graves used synthesizers to create sounds that he described as \\"odd\\". According to Graves, Evolves soundtrack has \\"evolved\\" as the game development progressed, and that it had shifted to become more electronic and synth-based. The Hunters' soundtracks are more futuristic and synth-sounding, while the Monsters' soundtracks are more drum- intense and distorting. =Publishing= Evolve adapts an asymmetrical multiplayer structure, a new concept in the video game industry during its development. It was so new that the developer itself worried and wondered why no one else was working on such project. The design team was also uncertain about whether the 4v1 structure would work or not. According to Turtle Rock, when the publishers heard that the original creators of Left 4 Dead were making a new game, they were interested. However, the design team encountered difficulties when they were pitching the game, and used two months to prepare for the pitching process. According to Robb, publishers were conservative and unsupportive about the idea and \\"[attempted] to poke holes\\" in their pitch. Even though the representatives from these publishers were excited about their pitch after they knew that it would be an extension to the Tank mode in Left 4 Dead, they questioned the ability of Turtle Rock making a triple-A video game, and were uncertain whether it was a project they should invest in. After multiple failures, the Turtle Rock team looked for a business partner, a company that supported the idea and was in need of a co-operative shooter to fit into their game's lineup. They eventually partnered with THQ for Evolve, which would serve as the game's publisher and help with funding. According to Robb, they had to show the game on their iPad, as they forgot to bring the battery for their laptop. THQ's then president, Danny Bilson and later, Jason Rubin were also excited about the idea. However, at that time, THQ had already entered financial difficulties, suffering from a severe decline in profits. Turtle Rock also knew that THQ had internal problems, but Turtle Rock decided not to part with THQ. THQ's financial situation continued to worsen and they declared bankruptcy on December 19, 2012. Evolve was listed alongside other unannounced titles from Relic Entertainment, Vigil Games, and THQ Studios Montreal in court documents filed by THQ. With THQ unable to continue its publishing and funding roles, an auction was held for other publishers to acquire these titles. Publishers interested in the game visited Turtle Rock Studio to see their \\"secret project\\". The team was frustrated, as they felt that the situation was \\"out of their control\\". Rubin later contacted Ashton and Robb, and suggested that they should bid the game themselves. They bid $250,000 for their own project, which Ashton described as \\"what [they] had in the bank\\". However, they were outbid by Take-Two Interactive, which paid $11 million to acquire the game and to secure the rights to the entire franchise, and its publishing label. 2K Games then served as the game's publisher. Despite being outbid, the Turtle Rock team was still \\"super excited\\" to collaborate with 2K. On January 8, 2015, Turtle Rock and 2K announced that Evolve had been declared gold, indicating it was being prepared for duplication and release. Release When Evolve was leaked in THQ's court document, it was expected that the game would be released on their 2015 fiscal year. The partnership between the two companies was revealed on May 26, 2011, and the game was re-revealed by gaming magazine Game Informer on January 7, 2014. It was announced that the game would be released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One globally on October 21, 2014. However, 2K later decided to extend Evolves development time frame, so as to allow Turtle Rock to further polish the game, as well as to \\"fully realize the vision for Evolve\\". As a result, Evolve was delayed to February 10, 2015. Prior to release, the game had been playtested multiple times by the general public. An alpha version of Evolve, called the 'Big Alpha' was released for Xbox One on October 31, 2014, The alpha version of Evolve was originally set to be released for the PlayStation 4 a day later on October 31, 2014, but was delayed to November 3, 2014 due to technical issues related to PS4's firmware update. As compensation, the duration of the demo was extended by a day, and ended on November 4, 2014 for all platforms. Players can play as the four classes of Hunters as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the alpha version. Turtle Rock expected 100,000 people to participate in the alpha. The team hoped that through the alpha testing, they could test the functionality of the game's servers, and make adjustments to the game's balance. Open beta trials of Evolve on Xbox One were held January 14‚Äì19, 2015. A limited test for the PlayStation 4 and PC was held January 16‚Äì19, 2015. Players could play as the first eight Hunters as well as the Goliath and Kraken in the beta. The Evacuation mode was also added to the beta on January 17, 2015. In addition to the game's standard edition, players can purchase the game's Season Pass, Deluxe Edition and PC Monster Race Edition. The Season Pass features four additional Hunters and a set of \\"magma\\" Monster skins. The Deluxe Edition features all the content of the Season Pass, as well as a new Monster called Behemoth. The PC Monster Race Edition, which is an exclusive for PC players, features the content of the Deluxe Edition, as well as the fifth Monster and two additional Hunters. After Evolves release, a new season pass, called Evolve Hunting Pass 2 was released on June 23, 2015. It features new skins, Hunters and a new Monster. =Other media= On January 21, 2015, a mobile game titled Evolve: Hunter Quest appeared briefly on the iOS App Store and was later removed. The game was released by 2K on January 29, 2015 for iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Fire OS devices. The game is a free-to-play tile- matching video game, as well as a companion app to Evolve. In Evolve: Hunter Quest, players match three tokens of the same colour in order to unleash attacks on enemies, fill up energy bars to activate special Hunter abilities and earn mastery points to level up. Mastery points earned in-app can then be applied to characters in the main Evolve game on any platform. Players who download the app can also unlock unique game art and watch replays of online matches from a top-down view. Evolve was launched with several merchandise items. Handled by Merchandise Monkey, the Evolves merchandise collection includes T-shirts and different figurines. Funko also made several toys for Evolve, including tall figurines of Markov, Val, Hank, Maggie and Goliath, each part of the first characters available to a player. A Goliath statue, standing at tall, was also available for purchase. =Post-release= In an interview with Official Xbox Magazine, Ashton claimed that Evolve would have the \\"best support for downloadable content ever\\". However, many of the downloadable content packages are not covered by Evolves Season Pass On November 21, 2014 Turtle Rock Studios co-founder Phil Robb confirmed with IGN that all DLC maps will be free of charge. Robb stated the reason for this is \\"to allow people who don't have the DLC, to still play against those who do, the only difference is that they can't play as those hunters or monsters\\". Despite Turtle Rock claiming that all DLC maps would be free to all players, the high number of paid DLCs has attracted criticism from fans who feel that it constitutes a large amount of content being deliberately withheld to be sold. A large number of players who purchased the game wrote negative reviews for the game on Steam, complaining about the excessive amount of DLC planned as well as the general direction of the game, leading to an overall userscore of \\"Overwhelmingly Negative\\" on the platform. Turtle Rock Studios countered this by claiming that as much content as possible was packaged with the main game, with DLC only including content created after the completion of Evolves development. At release, Evolve launched with 44 different paid-DLC skin packs. Free updates were added to the game. The Observer mode was added on March 31, 2015, and a less strategic mode, the Arena mode, was introduced on May 26, 2015. Robb thought that the game's format has the potential to become an eSports game. 2K expressed similar enthusiasm, and added that they would allocate resources into developing eSports-centric features to Evolve if fans of the game expressed demands for it. Turtle Rock and 2K collaborated with Electronic Sports League and Sony Pictures Entertainment to host a special tournament, in which players have to battle Chappie, the titular robot from the film Chappie, in February 2015. A Pro-Am Tournament of Evolve took place on March 6, 2015 during PAX East. During the tournament, they revealed that the eSport future of Evolve is determined. On June 15, 2015, another tournament was hosted by the Electronic Sports League and 2K. On July 6, 2016, Turtle Rock announced that the game was transitioning to become a free-to-play game under the title Evolve: Stage 2 due to the game downloadable content controversy and mixed critical reception. The new version introduces new changes, including longer respawn time, non-ranked queue for casual players, and changes to hunters' abilities. Turtle Rock also promised that patches would be released more frequently and that most items featured in the game would be unlocked through simply playing the game. The alpha version of Stage 2 would begin on July 7, 2016, for PC, and will be followed by a beta in August in the same year. Players who purchased the game will be given the Founders status, which gives them exclusive cosmetic items. In October 2016, Turtle Rock announced that they would end support for Evolve, and that Evolve: Stage 2 would not be released for consoles, but servers for the game will remain online for ‚Äòforeseeable future‚Äô. Turtle Rock also revealed that it was 2K's decision to end the game's support. On September 3, 2018, the game's dedicated servers were shut down, though the game remains playable with peer- to-peer connection using Legacy Evolve. Reception=Pre-release= Evolve received a largely positive reception from critics upon its initial announcement. It was nominated for six different awards in the Game Critics Awards, namely Best of Show, Best Original Game, Best Console Game, Best PC Game, Best Action Game and Best Online Multiplayer. It won four of them, and lost the Best Original Game Awards to No Man's Sky and Best PC Game to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Siege. Evolve was also named the Best Game, Best Console Game Microsoft Xbox, Best PC Game and Best Online Multiplayer Game at Gamescom 2014. Publisher 2K Games stated that these awards indicated that Evolve could become a defining title for both the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. However, the DLC controversy caused backlash from customers, and the game was criticized for serving as a framework for the release of DLC. =Post-release= Evolve received mostly positive reviews. Aggregating review website Metacritic gave the PlayStation 4 version 76/100 based on 46 reviews, the Microsoft Windows version 77/100 based on 38 reviews, and the Xbox One version 74/100 based on 31 reviews. The game received backlash from users on Steam, due to the excessive amount of DLC sold on day one and the game for being overpriced. The asymmetrical structure of the game mostly received praise from critics. Vince Ingenito, from IGN, thought that the system was smart and has successfully delivered a unique multiplayer experience for players. He added that the system is tactically deep, and that the \\"evolution\\" mechanic saved it from being gimmicky. This was contradicted by Steven Strom of Ars Technica, who stated that the game overall was just a \\"great gimmick and little else: something we'll play for a month or two, and not much longer.\\" Evan Lahti, from PC Gamer, commended the structure and considered it the most compressed multiplayer experience since 2014's Titanfall. He added that such structure is something that the genre needs. GameSpot's Kevin VanOrd also appreciated the structure, which he thought made every battle feel \\"vicious and intense\\". Anthony LaBella of Game Revolution praised the asymmetrical idea and felt that the distinct gameplay elements between monsters and hunters successfully introduce Evolve to a broad audience. However, he noted that such a structure may become repetitive and boring for players after months of playthrough. Jeff Marchiafava, from Game Informer, also felt the structure to be limited, and that Evolve, even with all the modes, had failed to offer enough variety and challenges to players. Nic Rowan, from Destructoid, thought that Evolve had presented some of the best moments he had had in a multiplayer game, but he felt that these moments are too far between. The Monster's gameplay was praised by Ingenito, as he thought it tasked players to use skills and patience while playing, and that Evolve has provided satisfying rewards for the player that successfully outsmarts the Hunters, a sentiment which was echoed by Strom. Lathi commended the Wraith, which he thought encouraged hit- and-run tactics. However, Rowan thought that the Monster gameplay can get old very fast. Furthermore, he noted that several Monsters felt overpowered, which made Evolve feel unbalanced. The controls of the game received praise. Marchiafava thought that it was smartly designed, and applauded it for its accessible nature. Lathi wrote a similar statement, but thought that the gameplay would be \\"difficult to master\\". David Meikleham from GamesRadar praised Evolves shooting mechanic, but complained that the action presented on-screen can become too chaotic for players to handle. Strom felt that the game-modes were unbalanced in terms of fun, and that certain game-modes prioritized fun for one team at the penalty of the other, and criticized the fact that outside of private lobbies with friends, you cannot choose any game- mode other than Hunt. The process of hunting the Monster was praised. Ingenito thought that the hunting process was as tense as the actual confrontation and combat between the Hunters and the Monster. The four classes was also applauded by him, as he considered that the distant class abilities have successfully made players co-operate with each other in order to achieve success, as well as making the decision of choosing the correct character important and tactical. This was also contradicted by Strom, who felt that the hunter gameplay up until finding the monster was \\"hollow\\", and generally just consisted of going around in circles. Marchiafava thought that Evolve had successfully delivered a compelling experience while playing with other players. He was also surprised by the game's balance between the Monster and the Hunters. Meikleham thought that playing the game with other players can be an exhilarating experience, but only when players communicate with each other using microphones. Rowan thought that Evolve could only deliver an enjoyable experience when all players play cooperatively, and the overall experience would crumble if one of these players failed to do so. Lathi liked Evolves resources management, singling out the need for the Hunters to manage and conserve the energy for their jetpacks. The Hunter characters featured in the game received praise. Ingenito thought that the Hunters in the game were memorable due to their pre-game dialog, and thought that the dialogue was well written. He called this the \\"true beauty\\" of Evolve. Rowan echoed a similar statement, calling the banter \\"charming\\". Marchiafava thought that the progression system has made the banter between characters repetitive because players need to play the game continuously to unlock characters. Marchiafava compared the narrative unfavorably to that of Left 4 Dead, and thought that it was not emergent enough. Evolves map-design received mixed reviews. Ingenito thought that Shear was a \\"beautifully realized\\" planet, while Marchiafava thought that all the maps were both detailed and varied. VanOrd thought that Turtle Rock had successfully captured an unsettling atmosphere, and applauded the verticality of the maps. Lathi agreed that the maps were well-designed. However, he criticized them for being \\"homogeneous\\", as all the maps felt too similar to each other, and none offered a particularly unique experience that required players to change their tactics. He added that the lack of variety had significantly lowered Evolves replayability. Meikleham echoed a similar statement, adding that the maps are \\"bland\\", and that they did not look different from each other. The progression system received criticism. Ingenito thought that it was an unnecessary addition to the game. He added that the upgrade system hides a lot of content from players unless they play the game frequently. Lathi, however, stated that after every character is unlocked, he felt less motivated to continue to play the game. LaBella thought that the system does not offer enough content and described it as \\"thin\\". This was echoed by Strom, who felt that unlocking the characters was a \\"grind\\". =Sales= Evolve debuted in No. 1 in the UK software-sales chart; the first title 2K Games had published to take the No. 1 spot since March 2013. Evolve was the second best selling game in the United States in February according to the NPD Group, only behind the handheld game The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D. However, the average player count on Steam declined significantly since the game's launch. The game's player count increased 15,930% and was listed as one of Steam's most-played games after its transition to a free-to- play model. More than a million new players played the game after the transition. Financial analyst Doug Creutz, of the Cowen Group, estimated only 300,000 physical copies were sold in Evolves launch month, and by its current sales rate, a well-below average figure for the triple-A gaming industry. Creutz stated that Evolve may be \\"too niche to reach a wide audience\\", adding that the negative reception to its DLC plan has hindered its success considerably. Despite such estimations, Karl Slatoff, President of Take-Two Interactive, stated that Evolve has achieved an ‚Äúincredibly successful\\" launch and that the company was very satisfied with the sales of the game. As of May 2015, 2.5 million copies of the game had been shipped. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick considered the property one of their \\"permanent\\" franchises, joining Grand Theft Auto, BioShock and Red Dead.

He is best known as the drummer of the indie rock band Frightened Rabbit, with whom he has recorded five studio albums. Frightened Rabbit began as a solo project for his brother, Scott, with Grant joining in 2004. The duo recorded the band's debut album, Sing the Greys (2006). Hutchison has performed on each of the band's releases to date, and contributed to the songwriting process of the band's fourth studio album, Pedestrian Verse (2013). Early life Hutchison was raised in Selkirk, Scotland with his older brothers Scott and Neil. Reflecting upon his mother's nickname for Scott, \\"Frightened Rabbit\\", which ultimately became the namesake of their future band, he stated: \\"I‚Äôd just get called 'The Bairn' on account of me being the youngest. There‚Äôd have been no way that I‚Äôd have ever been compared to a frightened rabbit when I was growing up ‚Äì I was something more akin to Warner Brothers‚Äô Tasmanian Devil. I was the polar opposite to Scott\\". Career with Frightened Rabbit In 2004, Hutchison, now living in Glasgow, joined his brother Scott in Frightened Rabbit, rendering them a two-piece band. Describing his entry into the band, Grant stated, \\"Scott started playing solo shows supporting friends' bands in Glasgow with just an acoustic guitar. I was the only drummer he knew so I got the job of being the second member of Frightened Rabbit. Basically I joined to make the whole thing a little bit noisier!\\". Grant and Scott subsequently recorded the band's 2006 debut album, Sing the Greys, with producer Marcus MacKay on his own label Hits the Fan. Regarding his aspirations during the band's early days, Hutchison noted: \\"When we first started my measure of success was selling out King Tut's, in Glasgow, and then being signed to Fat Cat and more recently getting the top ten album. Hopefully I never get to the stage where I can say ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve arrived‚Äù because I would never want to settle with what we have achieved\\". The band's two subsequent studio albums, The Midnight Organ Fight (2008) and The Winter of Mixed Drinks (2010), expanded the band's fanbase significantly. The album's tracks stemmed from Scott's fully formed songs, with Grant describing the writing process as \\"Scott [starting] the whole process off by writing the songs himself on an acoustic guitar and then I chip in with some drum ideas, and then we sort of figure it out from there\\". During the writing and recording process for the band's fourth studio album, Pedestrian Verse (2013), Scott Hutchison opened up the songwriting process to include Grant and the other members of the band. Grant stated: \\"The writing process was different. We were all involved from the beginning. So, I had a lot more input with this one, helping shape songs and taking them in different directions. It‚Äôs great to be a part of that, to have a real impact on the songs. In the past, I‚Äôve mostly just played drums along with fully formed songs. This time, I was playing along with very basic minimal tracks that Scott would lay down, and many times, it wouldn‚Äôt even have a melody yet. So that was new for me. It was great\\". The band's fifth studio album, Painting of a Panic Attack, was released in 2016. In 2018, Hutchison played alongside Scott and brothers Justin and James Lockey on the sole album from the project Mastersystem. Scott's death in May 2018 effectively brought Frightened Rabbit to an end as a working band. However, Hutchison appeared behind the drums as a Frightened Rabbit member later that year: with fellow band member Billy Kennedy at the Belladrum Festival as part of a tribute by The Charlatans, and with the band featuring guest vocalists as part of the Glasgow charity event Sleep in the Park, in December 2018. Solo work In 2013, Grant mentioned the possibility of working on his own material, stating: \\"I'm hoping to maybe get something started with some friends back in Glasgow when I get home. I've spoken to someone about that recently. I've got some songs I've been working on. I think it'd be nice to do something else, not because I don‚Äôt like [playing in Frightened Rabbit]. I absolutely love it, but it'd be nice to have something else too\\". In 2018 he appeared on Let's Be Wilderness, the second album by Postdata. Personal life Hutchison has praised his and Scott's parents for their support with Frightened Rabbit, noting: \\"I will always be eternally in debt to my parents for being so supportive when things weren't so rosy with the band. Whenever I need them they are there, and they're just as important in the band's progress as Scott and myself\\". Regarding potential career options were he not a member of Frightened Rabbit, Hutchison had noted: \\"I have no qualifications to do anything else, so I'd probably be working in a cheese shop or trying to make my own cider. It's difficult to think about that because everything I have managed to do because of Frightened Rabbit has made me who I am now, and I can't really say where I would be without it\\". Following the end of the band, in 2019 Hutchison launched a cider import and distribution company, Re:stalk. He and wife Jaye married in 2018 and had a daughter in 2020. They live in Glasgow. Hutchison is a supporter of the Cystinosis Foundation UK and a trustee of the mental health charity Tiny Changes, set up by his family following the death of his brother Scott.https://tinychanges.com/2019/11/22/trustee-blog-4/ He has participated in several charity sports events, including The Great Big Cycle (2014) and the Great Scottish Run half-marathon in Glasgow (2018).

The cemetery is at least 800 years old. In the 13th century in the Ilkhanid era Takht-e Foulad was the most important cemetery in Isfahan and all of the famous personalities have a mausoleum in this cemetery. Unfortunately all of the mausoleums from the Ilkhanid era, except Baba Rokn ed-Din mausoleum, which is the oldest structure in Takht-e Foulad, have been destroyed. In the Safavid era there were 400 mausoleums in Takht-e Foulad, but there are now only 8 mausoleums from the Safavid era. In the Qajar era a large part of the cemetery was destroyed, but the cemetery hasn't lost its importance and by the end of Pahlavi era it was the most important cemetery in Isfahan. There are 20 structures from the Qajar era and 17 structures from the Pahlavi era in the cemetery. Before the Safavid age the cemetery had been known as Lessan ol-Arz and Baba Rokn ed-Din, but from the Safavid age until now its name is Takht-e Foulad.' By the demand of people authorities have established Takht-e Foulad Cultural and Religious Complex in 1994 for rebuilding, organizing, and repairing this valuable cemetery. Since 1994, many gravestones have been repaired and rebuilt by this institution. The best days for visiting the cemetery are Thursdays and Fridays, because the most of mausoleums are open for visitors.  Most important places in Takht-e Foulad = Baba Rokn ed- Din mausoleum = Although Baba Rokn ed-Din was a high ranking Baba in the 14th century, but there are few information about his life and works. The construction of the current building started in the era of Abbas I and was completed in the era of Safi. = Valeh mausoleum = Valeh Esfahani was a poet and calligrapher in Isfahan during the reign of Fath-Ali Shah. He died in 1814 and a mausoleum was built on his grave. = Mir section = Many notabilities habe been buried in Takht-e Foulad. One of them is Mir Fendereski, the famous mystic and scholar in the Safavid era. His grave has been covered by a single large piece of marble stone. On the stone, the date of the Islamic calendar has been written, which is equal to 1640 in the Gregorian calendar. In a room next to the grave, a ghazal of Hafez (in Nastaliq script) has been made with stucco by Mir Emad, the famous calligrapher in the Safavid era. It is the only inscription by Mir Emad, which has been written on the wall of a building.'

Early life Jebara was born on 1 July 1957 in the town of al-Alam, to the North East of Tikrit. He graduated from secondary school in 1975. Military career After graduating from secondary school Jebara joined the army, and entering into the Iraqi Military Academy, from which he graduated in 1979 as a Lieutenant in an armored unit. During his military career Jebara participated in every war involving Iraq. During his career Jebara was also wounded several times, including being shot three times.Jebara Memorial Facebook Page Jebara entered the Iraqi Staff college in 1987, graduating in 1989. During this period he also studied at the University of Madras, graduating with a master's degree (with honors) in political science in 1991. He later attended the War College, graduating with honors in 2000. Following this he held several positions, including commanding an armored battalion, an armored brigade, and later went on to teach at the War College. During the Saddam era Jebara also held a high-level position in the Ba'ath party, holding the rank of Firqa, equivalent to a branch chief. He also served in the Iraqi Army, and was a Deputy Division Commander during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq, with the rank of Brigadier General. Following the invasion Jebara was arrested by Coalition Forces, however he was released within 24 hours due to the intervention of a relative. Political career Following the overthrow of the Ba'athist government of Iraq Jebara began working with the Coalition Forces. He initially began working as an interpreter for Coalition Forces in 2003, although quickly moved into governance. He was known for playing a critical role in convincing Sunni Arabs in Saladin to work with the Coalition instead of turning towards violence, and a 2008 diplomatic cable referred to him as potentially the most powerful person in the province, due in part to individuals with whom he had close connections, familial or otherwise, also holding powerful positions in the Saladin provincial government. Jebara campaigned on behalf of the No Vote during the 2005 Iraqi constitutional referendum. Jebara did so claiming that the referendum would be the start of the division of Iraq, and would result in the squandering of Iraq's oil wealth. Following the execution of Saddam Hussein, Jebara brought Saddam's body back to Tikrit for burial. Jebara was allegedly involved in a campaign to intimidate political rivals. In early 2008 members of the Arab National Bloc and the National Movement for Development and Reform in Saladin accused Jebara and Major Ahmed Fahal, the head of the Saladin Police Department Counterterrorism Unit, of political harassment. The two were accused of shutting offices belonging to the parties without warning, detaining office guards, and verbally threatening party members. The alleged reasoning was because of the ANB's reputed links with the PUK, and al-Haq's reputed connections to Iran. During this time Jebara became known as a vocal critic of al-Qaeda. Death Jebara was killed by al-Qaeda during the 2011 Tikrit assault. During the assault some 56 people were killed. The dead included Jebara, along with 2 other councillors. All three were executed by al-Qaeda by means of gunshots to the head, and their bodies were then burnt. Personal life Jebara was a member of the Jabouri tribe. Jebara's younger brother, Colonel Jasim Hussein Jebara, served as director of National Security for Saladin Province. His older brother, was the top Sheikh of the Juabouri tribe in Saladin governorate.

Reception Michael Dibdin writing in The Independent explains that \\"The title puns on the Elizabethan sense of 'juggle': to play tricks so as to cheat or deceive somebody. Everyone in the novel does this to some extent, wittingly or not, as they try to juggle the details of their lives, keeping all the balls in the air, holding the pattern together. The most daring and skilful juggler of all is Barbara Trapido herself, who puts her characters through dizzying permutations of gender, identity, background and relationships, both personal and genetic. The pace increases imperceptibly, creeping up on the reader, until what started as a fairly sober and straightforward study of generational conflicts ends in a pyrotechnic climax which exploits every Shakespearian device - identical twins, lost siblings, transposed parents, unlikely couples, outrageous coincidences and brazenly expedient plotting - to an extent which might have made even the Bard blush.\\" and he concludes \\"The result is a work of enormous charm, highly entertaining and told with a deft touch, which handles serious matters lightly and treats light ones with proper respect\\".BOOK REVIEW / A better sort of tragedy: Juggling by Barbara Trapido - Hamish Hamilton pounds 9.99 - Arts & Entertainment - The Independent ReferencesExternal links *Interview with Barbara Trapido Category:1994 British novels Category:Sequel novels Category:Hamish Hamilton books Category:British bildungsromans ","title":"Juggling (novel)"},{"id":"41576443","title":"Surendra Singh Nagar"},{"id":"41576444","text":"Subterinebrica nigrosignatana is a species of moth of the family Tortricidae.
