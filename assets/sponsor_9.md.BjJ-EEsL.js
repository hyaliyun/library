During the First Kashmir War, this town was a strategic location for the Dogra Army but it was quickly abandoned and captured by the advancing Pakistani soldiers and tribesmen. After the war ended, many Pashtun soldiers decided to settle in this town and are still present in Chakswari today. Geography Chakswari comprises partly plain and partly hilly areas. Chakswari has pleasant scenery and the climate is generally arid, characterised by hot summers and cool winters. There is little rainfall.

Chakswari is divided into two parts: the historic old town where the majority of the wholesale shops, for which the town is known, are located; and the newer part, Chakswari Colony, which was built for the families who lost their homes following the construction of Mangla Dam. Chakswari Bazaar is the local shopping centre, which has brands such as the Nafees Bakery (popular UK Store). In chackswari there is many good food restaurants.

Almost any kind of fruit can be used, like wild strawberry, blueberry, plum and cherry. Traditionally, all guests in Bulgarian and Serbian homes are greeted with a spoonful of slatko/sladko and a cup of water as soon as seated. Particularly honoured guests are offered twice, although any guest can ask for another taste, to honour the housekeeper. For the second taste another spoon must be used. To ask for the third time, if not offered, is regarded as an improper behaviour, although usually granted. Alternatively, in the same manner, the guests may be offered honey (or asked to choose). Prior to the creation of Yugoslavia, the tradition of slatko was common and widespread only in the historical Serbia, south of Sava and Danube and was unknown in Vojvodina or other parts of Austro-Hungarian Empire. Slatko is used as a topping for ice cream and waffle shortcakes, and as a filling in pancakes.  Variants  The most usual types of slatko are those made of whole strawberries, slightly unripe skinned plums or sour cherries. Other fresh fruits like raspberries, sweet cherries, watermelon cubes, rose petals, quinces, grapes, figs, skinned apricot halves or quarters, peaches, blueberries, blackberries or redcurrants can also be used. If a plum slatko is prepared, walnut halves or almonds may be added to the mixture or even inserted into the plums themselves to replace the pits. Some fruits and vegetables (like rhubarb and physalis) rarely grown in Serbia have also been demonstrated to be well suited for slatko. Frozen berries and fruits may be used as well, but the amount of water and the cooking time should be adjusted accordingly.Serbian Cafe Slatko-od-lubenica.jpgSlatko of watermelon rinds - the traditional way to serve slatko Tableware for serving slatko and water (Serbian custom).jpgTableware for serving slatko and water See also * List of dessert sauces  References  Category:Serbian cuisine Category:Bulgarian cuisine Category:Sephardi Jewish cuisine Category:Dessert sauces Category:Guest greeting food and drink Category:Jams and jellies ","title":"Slatko"},{"id":"15081303","text":"Campbell Township is the name of two townships in the U.S. state of Indiana: * Campbell Township, Jennings County, Indiana * Campbell Township, Warrick County, Indiana See also *Campbell Township (disambiguation).

It has a population of around 5000, mixed with Bayei (who make large part of the population), Bakalanga, Bananjwa and Banoka. The reasons for the small population may be that people migrated from the village because there are no industries set up, no minerals to extract, and poor soils for both pastoral and arable farming. Somewhere in the 1900s due to divide and rule, the Yeyi people were moved from areas around Maun to the central district. According to the elders, the few Yei people that were migrated from the Ngami region pleaded with the authorities at the time to at least leave them at Mmadikola, the reason being they are people of the water as their name carries that meaning. At the time a large area of Mmadikola was covered with water and rivers were overflowing. They were left there.

He had a thesis that it subject addressed as follows: \\"The importance of statistical mechanics to explain the energy distribution in solids transparent (amorphous) spiral shape using numerical methods\\", this thesis was discussed in front of 16 scientists, senior physicists in France and it was a subject of appreciation and admiration prompting then the French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac to meet student researcher Rammal Rammal. This thesis has caused a major stir in the academic community and in France. Rammal became famous all around the world, he went to many important universities in the United States as a visiting professor and an especially in the US space agency, \\"NASA\\". During 1983-1984, Rammal served as a visiting professor for six months in Nuclear Physics, co-managing the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia Research Department (United States) and Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. He had also served as a visiting professor for another six months in the Department of Physics at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada. During 1984-1986, he served as a research professor at the National Center for Scientific Research at the University of Grenoble. Rammal was deputed by the French National Center for Research for representation in several scientific conferences in France and internationally. In 1988, he was promoted to become the head of research team and he was only 37 years old. He was the only person to be in this position in France, even though he didn't have the French nationality. Dr. Rammal has published 113 scientific researches in the topics of statistical physics research (Mathematics, thermodynamic, laws of motion applications specific heat in solids, liquids and gases, molecular hydrogen gas behavior in the lower temperature limits, extreme behavior of nuclear particles in the microscopic tropical systems, characteristics of the Fermi-Dirac statistics, etc. ..). Dr. Rammal research has contributed to build the basics and origins of modern physics and development. As a result of the importance of his research, the National Center for Scientific Research awarded him a bronze medal in 1984, in recognition of the best doctoral thesis in France. In addition, the French government awarded a silver medal for Scientific Research, and it was presented by the French Minister of education himself in 1988, in recognition of his research in the fields of statistical physics. In 1989, the French magazine Le Point included Rammal's name in an article in 11 December 1989 among the one hundred French figures representing the glory of France. He was named among the top twenty French character who will play an important role in changing France in the 2000s. And as the magazine mentioned: \\"Dr. Rammal Rammal was a mathematician-physicist of Lebanese origin, and one of the leading specialists of the few at the global level in the intensification of material and energy storage research areas.\\"  Awards  * The Rammal Award for scientists from Mediterranean countries was created in his honor by the EuroScience organization and has been awarded annually since 1993. * Rammal Rammal high school was built in his hometown Doueir for his honor. * The science and research States magazine awarded him in 1984, the smallest researcher in the world of his generation. * the French government awarded him a silver medal for Scientific Research. * the French magazine Le Point named him among the top twenty French character who will play an important role in changing France in the 2000s. * the National Center for Scientific Research awarded him a bronze medal in 1984, in recognition of the best doctoral thesis in France.

They are a kind of pork \\"crisps\\", with fat thermally extracted from the lard. ƒåvarci are mostly a rustic countryside specialty, common to the cuisines of Serbia, continental Croatia, Slovenia (), Romania () and Ukraine (), though they can also be found in some other countries of throughout Eastern Europe. They are usually homemade, with industrial production not as pronounced. In larger cities they can be obtained on farmer markets or in supermarkets.  Preparation  Preparation of ƒçvarci involves melting the lard. Lard is cut in blocks of about one inch (2.54 cm) in size and slowly fried in their own fat. Milk may be added at this point in order to obtain caramel colour. Process lasts until all fat melts away and only a kind of tough crispy pork rind remains. Onion or garlic may be added as a spice and salt is always used as condiment. Pieces of skin may or may not be attached. In most common varieties of ƒçvarci, some percentage of pork fat remains. –ü–æ—Å–µ–∫ —É –®–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞ 05.jpgCooking –ü–æ—Å–µ–∫ —É –®–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞ 06.jpgSqueezing –ü–æ—Å–µ–∫ —É –®–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞ 11.JPGAfter squeezing –ü–æ—Å–µ–∫ —É –®–∞—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞ 08.jpgFinal product  Duvan ƒçvarci  Preparative of duvan ƒçvarci in Valjevo, Serbia A special variety of ƒçvarci known as duvan ƒçvarci are mostly produced in the Western Serbia region and especially around the town of Valjevo. In case of duvan ƒçvarci, the process of slow fat frying/cooking is prolonged until all the fat has been extracted. The remainder is a mass of delicate fibers which resembles finely chopped tobacco, thus giving the name to the variety: duvan is a Serbian word for tobacco. Indications for duvan ƒçvarci had been registered and protected in the Serbian intellectual property office by Slavoljub Batoƒáanin. A similar process is used to the same effect in Hrvatsko Zagorje, where ƒçvarci are pressed in a potato press to achieve faster fat extraction.  Consumption  Pogaƒçice sa ƒçvarcima, a pastry made with ƒçvarci As with most traditional pork products, they are considered to be winter food. Traditional time for pork processing in the Balkans is late autumn, and ƒçvarci are consumed throughout the winter. They can be eaten on their own as a snack, served with heated fruit brandy common to the same region, called rakija, or they can be used as an ingredient in other food recipes (such as proja baked with ƒçvarci). In Croatia, they are most often eaten with bread and onions. If consumed as a snack, they are very often combined with beer.

Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint being a red or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black. A large selection of these various colors is shown below. In specific color systems=Red (CMYK) (pigment red)= Cyan, magenta, and yellow are the three subtractive primary colors used in printing Pigment red is the color red that is achieved by mixing process (printer's) magenta and process (printer's) yellow in equal proportions. This is the color red that is shown in the diagram located at the bottom of the following website offering tintbooks for CMYK printing: . The purpose of the CMYK color system is to provide the maximum possible gamut of colors capable of being reproduced in printing. Psychedelic art made people used to brighter colors of red, and pigment colors or colored pencils called \\"true red\\" are produced by mixing pigment red with a tiny amount of white. The result approximates (with much less brightness than is possible on a computer screen) the electric red shown above. =Red (Crayola)= The color defined as red in Crayola crayons is displayed at right. Red was one of the original colors formulated by Crayola in 1903. =Red (Munsell)= The hues of the Munsell color system, at varying values, and maximum chroma to stay in the sRGB gamut The color defined as red in the Munsell color system (Munsell 5R) is shown at right. The Munsell color system is a color space that specifies colors based on three color dimensions: hue, value (lightness), and chroma (color purity), spaced uniformly in three dimensions in the elongated oval at an angle shaped Munsell color solid according to the logarithmic scale which governs human perception. In order for all the colors to be spaced uniformly, it was found necessary to use a color wheel with five primary colors‚Äîred, yellow, green, blue, and purple. The Munsell colors displayed are only approximate as they have been adjusted to fit into the sRGB gamut. =Red (NCS) (psychological primary red)= Approximations within the sRGB gamut to the primary colors of the Natural Color System, a model based on the opponent process theory of color vision The color defined as red in the NCS or Natural Color System is shown at right (NCS 1080-R). The Natural Color System is a color system based on the four unique hues or psychological primary colors red, yellow, green, and blue. The NCS is based on the opponent process theory of vision. The Natural Color System is widely used in Scandinavia. =Red (Pantone)= The color defined as red in Pantone is displayed at right.

This color is an approximation of an orangish red spectral color. It is one of the three primary colors of light in the RGB color model, along with green and blue. The three additive primaries in the RGB color system are the three colors of light chosen such as to provide the maximum gamut of colors that are capable of being represented on a computer or television set, at a reasonable expense of power. Portable devices such as mobile phones might have an even narrower gamut due to this purity‚Äìpower tradeoff and their \\"red\\" may be less colorful and more orangish than the standard red of sRGB. This color is also the color called red in the X11 web colors, which were originally formulated in 1987. It is also called color wheel red.

Diabolepis is the most basal known dipnoan. A rather small fish, the fossil has risen to prominence as it has four nares like most fish, while modern lungfish have only two, the hindmost pair having moved on to the palate serving as choanae. This proved that the internal nares of lungfish had evolved independently of those in tetrapods. This has made the internal nares a case of parallel evolution rather than a homology between lungfish and tetrapods. Characteristics Diabolepis has a prominent snout; the more recurvature the snout, the greater is the proportion of the premaxilla that is included within the mouth cavity. The teeth within the premaxilla are folded with polyplocodont structure. The maxilla was either toothless or absent or there may have been a gap between the premaxilla and the maxilla. There is an intracranial joint or ventral fissure, two external nostrils, and separate enthopterygoids. One or several bones lie lateral to the anterior end of the postparietals. The skull roof has an incipient \\"B\\" bone between the postparietals. The rest of the skull roof has a tendency towards fragmentation into small bones. The endocranium is divided. The anterior nostril lies at the mouth margin. There can only be a narrow space between nostril and mouth, and an interrupted canal has been scored for Diabolepis.

Thirty women were put on trial, accused of sorcery and making pacts with the Devil. One was sentenced to a work house, two tortured to death, and eighteen were burned alive at the stake. It was the peak of the witch hunt which had intensified in Northern Norway since the first great Vard√∏ witch trial in 1621. Vard√∏ was the center of Norwegian Nordkalotten. Many witch trials were held here during the 17th century, the biggest in 1621, in 1652‚Äì1653 and in 1662‚Äì1663.  The witch trial = Context = About 140 witch trials were held in Finnmark in the 17th century between 1601 and 1692 in what is sometimes considered as the worst persecution in times of peace in Norway according to Rune Hagen. 90 persons were condemned to death sentences in these trials. The Steilneset memorial is dedicated to these persecuted witches. = Beginning of the trial = On 2 September 1662 Dorthe Lauritzdotter was brought in for questioning at the Vard√∏hus fortress. She had been accused once before, but acquitted, in 1657. Lauritz Braas said that two of his servants, who had recently died, had claimed to be bewitched by her. Four witches led by Dorthe in the shape of a dove, an eagle, a crow and a swan were to have opened their \\"wind-knots\\" over the sea to make a boat sink, but the plot supposedly failed because the crew had prayed to God. Dorthe was burned at the stake on 6 November 1662 with two other women, soon followed by another two. At Christmas 1662 children were accused when sisters Ingeborg Iversdatter and Karen Iversdatter (8 years old), children of one of the newly executed women, were brought in for questioning with Maren Olsdatter, the niece of one of the executed women. The children told many stories, and the priest had a hard time making them say the catechism when they were in the \\"trollkvinnefengeselhullet\\" (the \\"witches-hole\\") in the fortress, where witches were kept awaiting verdict.  The Sabbath  Ingeborg Iversdatter confessed during interrogations on 26 January 1663 that she and S√∏lve Nilsdatter had celebrated Christmas 1662 in Kiberg with Maren Olsdatter and Sigri Klockare while incarcerated in the witches-hole. She and Solveig had transformed themselves into cats and crawled under the gate and met Maren and Sigri, who came flying over the sea from Vardangerfjorden, in Kiberg. They had broken into a basement and helped themselves to wine until they became drunk, while Satan held the candle for them. The two adult women had argued, and S√∏lve had become so drunk that Satan had a hard time getting her on her feet and back to jail later that night. The priest of the fortress pointed out that this must have been the reason why alcohol had disappeared from the basement. S√∏lve Nilsdatter confessed during the interrogations in January that, in the Christmas of 1661, a gigantic witches' sabbath had been held at Dovrefjell mountain in southern Norway, where the witches had arrived in the shapes of dogs and cats to drink and dance with Satan, who appeared in the shape of a black dog. When Margrette Jonsdotter danced with him, she had lost her shoe, but Satan had given her a new one.  Child witnesses  Twelve-year-old Maren Olsdatter's mother had been executed for sorcery years before; the girl had been taken care of by her aunt, and now, after her aunt had also been burned, she herself had been arrested. When Maren was interrogated on 26 January her confession was given much attention. She claimed to have visited Hell, where she had been given a tour by Satan. Satan had showed her \\"a great water\\" down in a black valley, which began to boil when he blew fire through a horn of iron. In the water there had been people, who cried like cats. He had put a ham in the water and it was cooked immediately, and told her that she too would boil in the water as a reward if she served him. Later she had visited the sabbath of Satan on Domen between Svartnes and Kiberg, where Satan played dancing music on a red violin, gave the witches beer, and followed each of them home personally. When the court asked her which people she had seen there, she gave the names of five women, among them Ingeborg Krog from Makkaur, who she said had followed her to Hell in the shape of a dove. Ingeborg Krog was brought in for questioning. She denied the accusations and was subjected to the ordeal of water. When she failed the test, and continued to plead her innocence, she was subjected to torture. She confessed nothing under torture, except for one story which did not satisfy the court: she claimed that she had once eaten a fish she had been offered by a woman who had been executed for sorcery in 1653, and may have consumed some magic at that occasion. S√∂lve Nilsdotter then said that Ingeborg was just as much a witch as the rest of them, that she had made a boat get lost at sea, and that it was in fact she who had taught them to avoid revealing anything. Ingeborg continued to assert her innocence. She was cut with burning iron and sulphur was put on her chest, but the only thing she said was, \\" I cannot lie on myself or on others. Oh no, such can they torment the body, but they cannot torment my soul. \\" Ingeborg was tortured to death and her corpse was laid on an island opposite the gallows. Eight-year-old Karen Iversdatter claimed that three witches in the shape of crows had attempted to assassinate the official with a needle. Maid Ellen was arrested for being one of them, and confessed that she had used sorcery to affect cattle. Ellen was burned with Sigri Klockare on 27 February 1663. Barbra from Vads√∏ was pointed out by Maren as one of those who had been flying with Dorthe on Domen. Barbra said that Maren had accused her, encouraged by doctor's wife Anne Rhodius, who had been exiled from Oslo to northern Norway with her husband because of conflicts in Oslo, and that the doctor and his wife had pointed out the wife and daughter of one of the members of the court as witches. This was ignored and Barbra was burned with four other women 8 April 1663. S√∂lve Nilsdotter, Margrette Jonsdotter, and two more women were burned to death in Vard√∏ 20 March 1663.  Aftermath  On 25 June 1663 the last accused witches, Magdalene from Andersby, Ragnhild Endresdatter and Gertrude Siversdatter, along with her daughter Kirsten S√∏rensdatter, were brought from the witches-hole. They claimed that Maren and the other children had come up with their confessions under the influence of the exiled Anne Rhodius, who had also visited them in jail and threatened them with torture to make them confess. Magdalene, Gertrude and Ragnhild were freed. All the children were acquitted in June 1663. Maren Olsdatter told the Court of Appeal judge that Anne Rhodius had misled her to lie against other people, denouncing them for witchcraft. According to a document in the archives of the Regional Governor of Finnmark, the Court of Appeal Judge, Mandrup Sc√∏nneb√∏l, sentenced Maren for having lied on herself and others, to stay for some time at the workhouse in Bergen. However this is not entered into the Court of Appeals protocol, and was probably not effectuated, as there is documentation that she lived in Vard√∏ after 1663. Doctor Ambrosius Rhodius was pardoned by a letter from the King of 2 July 1666 but his wife, Anne Fredericksdatter Rhodius, lived in exile in Vard√∏ fortress in Finnmark until her death in 1672. This was the last of the many great witch trials of Northern Norway. More people were accused in the following decades, but only two of those cases (in 1678 and 1695) led to a death sentence.

Formed in 2003, the band currently features singer-guitarist Parker Griggs, bassist Anthony Meier and drummer Paul Marrone. Signed to Alive Naturalsound Records, the trio has released five full-length albums as of June 2017. History=Early Years= Prior to the formation of the band, Parker Griggs recorded under the solo alias Garbage Composal. After completing an album's worth of material, Griggs enlisted bassist Serana Andersen to form Radio Moscow, and the duo relocated to Colorado. Following a show, Griggs got a demo into the hands of The Black Keys frontman Dan Auerbach, who then helped in getting Radio Moscow signed to Alive Naturalsound Records. During this time, Parker recorded the contents of 3 & 3 Quarters which was eventually released in 2012 under Radio Moscow. The album is predominantly Garage Rock, with all instruments handled by Griggs. =Radio Moscow= Upon returning to Iowa, Luke McDuff was brought in as the new bassist of the group. They recorded the band's debut album in 2006, with Auerbach handling production duties; Radio Moscow was released in February 2007. Shortly after the release of the album, McDuff was replaced by Zach Anderson. =Brain Cycles & The Great Escape of Leslie Magnafuzz= Since 2007, Radio Moscow have toured many regions of the world, with a number of live drummers including Keith Rich, Todd Stevens and Paul Marrone. The band's second album Brain Cycles was released in April 2009, this time self-produced by the band. Radio Moscow later released their third album The Great Escape of Leslie Magnafuzz in October 2011. A previously unreleased album entitled 3 & 3 Quarters, recorded in 2003 and featuring Griggs only, was released in April 2012. During a concert in support of the album, a physical confrontation erupted on stage involving Parker and drummer, Berry, in which a guitar was thrown at Parker which stuck him on the head and created a gash that later required fourteen stitches. Zach Anderson and Cory Berry immediately left the band and went on to form Blues Pills in Sweden. =Magical Dirt= On their official website Radio Moscow announced that they plan on releasing their fourth studio album sometime in 2013. Bassist Billy Ellsworth left the band in July, and was replaced with Anthony Meier. On July 15, 2013 the band announced that they were happy with the progress of their new album and planned to 'road test' them in Europe. On December 11, 2013 it was announced that the band was set to begin recording their latest album that month. The album was completed by January 22, 2014. On February the 11th the band announced their fourth album is to be called Magical Dirt. The album was released on June 17, 2014. Live! In California the band's first live album, was released in 2016. It was recorded over two nights at The Satellite Club in Los Angeles, compiled of material from their studio albums, along with a cover version of Sainte Anthony's Fyre's song, Chance of Fate. =New Beginnings= On January 19, 2017, the band announced via social media that they had signed to Century Media Records, and that work had already begun on their fifth full-length album. They entered the studio in April. They soon announced that their first album with the new record label, New Beginnings, was planned for release on September 29 and that there was to be a supporting '\\"The Drifting Tour\\" across Europe, including several festivals, with special guests Kaleidobolt. The artwork for the album, along with the lead single, New Beginning was unveiled on July 18. In 2018, the band embarked on their first Australian tour. Musical style and influence Radio Moscow are often compared stylistically to blues rock bands from the 1960s and 1970s, particularly fellow power trios like Cream, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Pretty Things, The Who and Blue Cheer. Reviewing the band's self-titled album for music website AllMusic, Greg Prato described the group's sound as \\"a throwback to the classic rock of the '70s\\", comparing certain songs to artists such as Ram Jam, The Allman Brothers Band and The Jeff Beck Group. Following the release of Brain Cycles, Radio Moscow have also been cited as an example of the stoner rock genre.

She was reputed to have received frequent visions of the Virgin Mary, and her local cultus was confirmed by Pope Leo X in 1517.  Life  Veronica grew up in the small town of Binasco, Italy, not far from Milan. She and her family were poor and she worked with her mother and father, doing chores and in the fields. Her parents set their daughter on the path to Christian virtues, as it was said that her father was a scrupulously honest man, never selling a horse without first disclosing its faults or imperfections to the buyer. As she developed a desire for saintliness and perfection, she became tired of the joking and songs of her companions, even hiding her head and weeping as she worked. Assumption of St. Veronica of Milan, from the Church of Binasco Having no formal education, she attempted, unsuccessfully, to teach herself to read. While making this effort one night, it is said that the Virgin Mary appeared to Veronica, telling her that while some of her pursuits were necessary, her reading was not. Instead, the Virgin taught her in the form of three mystical letters: Veronica became accustomed to nearly constant apparitions and religious ecstasies. She saw scenes from the life of Christ, yet these never interrupted her work. She joined an Augustinian lay order at the convent of Saint Martha in Milan at the age of 22. This community was very poor; Veronica's job was to beg in the streets of the city for food. After three years into her vocation as a nun she became racked with secret bodily pains, but was notably patient and obedient to her superiors. She received a vision of Christ in 1494, and was given a message for Pope Alexander VI, and traveled to Rome to deliver it. After a six-month illness, Veronica died on the date she had predicted, 13 January 1497.  Veneration  The Virgin Mary appears to Veronica from Little Pictorial Lives of the Saints by the Benziger Brothers, 1878 Veronica is remembered in the Augustinian Order for her obedience and desire for work.

The book included an illustration \\"Tabula genealogico-geographica affinitatum plantarum secundum ordines naturales Linnaei\\" which showed the affinities of the families in a form similar to a geographical map. It included circles for families with the size indicating the number of genera contained.

It is based on the local application of short and intense electric pulses that transiently permeabilize the cell membrane, thus allowing transport of molecules otherwise not permitted by the membrane. Applications for treatment of cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors have reached clinical use by utilizing drugs such as bleomycin or cisplatin). Electrochemotherapy with bleomycin was used to treat a patient for the first time in 1991 at the Institute Gustave Roussy in France, while electrochemotherapy with cisplatin was used to treat for the first time in 1995 at the Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Slovenia. Since then, more than 4000 patients were treated with electrochemotherapy all over the world (Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA). Recently, new electrochemotherapy modalities have been developed for treatment of internal tumors using surgical procedures, endoscopic routes, or percutaneous approaches to gain access to the treatment area. Physical principle Basic steps in electrochemotherapy treatment When a biological cell is exposed to an electric field of sufficient strength, an increase in the transmembrane voltage is generated, which leads to rearrangements of the cell membrane structure. These changes result in an increase of the cell membrane permeability, which allows nonpermeant molecules to enter the cell. This phenomenon is called electroporation (or electropermeabilization) and is becoming widely used to improve anticancer drug delivery into cells, which is being referred to as electrochemotherapy. All biomedical applications of cell electropermeabilization use direct currents (all unipolar) with short and intense pulses (even though in vitro, time-decayed pulses can be used). Amplitude of the pulses depends on the tissues and on the shape and position of the electrodes, but, in vivo, in the case of the tumors, the amplitude of the electric pulses has to be high enough to establish an electrical field of 400 V/cm in the area of tumor (8 pulses with duration of 100 microseconds). The duration of pulses is usually one hundred microseconds. In early experiments, pulses were delivered with period of 1 second (i.e. at a repetition frequency of 1 Hz); today, pulses are delivered in a much shorter time period, at a repetition frequency of 5000 Hz, resulting in a much less discomfort for the patient and in the shorter duration of treatment. For treatment of deep-seated tumors in relative vicinity of the heart, pulses are synchronized with absolute refractory period of each heartbeat to minimize the probability of interaction of pulses with the heart function. Treatment Left: plate electrodes; Right: needle electrodes The electrochemotherapeutic treatment consists of delivering, either systemically or locally, non-permeant cytotoxic drugs (e.g. bleomycin) or low-permeant drugs (e.g. cisplatin) and applying electric pulses to the area to be treated when the concentration of the drug in the tumor is at its peak. With the delivery of the electric pulses, cells are subjected to an electric field that causes the formation of nanoscale defects on the cell membrane, which alter the permeability of the membrane. At this stage and for some time after pulses are delivered, molecules of the cytotoxic agents can freely diffuse into the cytoplasm and exert their cytotoxic effect. Multiple positioning of the electrodes, and subsequent pulse delivery, can be performed during a session to treat the whole lesion, provided that drug concentration is sufficient. Treatment can be repeated over the course of weeks or months to achieve regression of large lesions. Efficacy and clinical relevance In a number of clinical studies (phase II and phase III), investigators have concluded that electrochemotherapy of cutaneous or subcutaneous metastasis or tumours with bleomycin and cisplatin have an objective response rate of more than 80%. Reduction of tumor size has been achieved with electrochemotherapy faster and more efficiently than in standard chemotherapy for both cutaneous and subcutaneous tumors. Patients with skin metastasis from melanoma, Kaposi sarcoma, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or breast cancer have been successfully treated. First clinical results of electrochemotherapy of internal tumors (e.g. liver metastases) are also promising and encouraging. The success rate for electrochemotherapy in \\"human malignancies\\" has been stated to be more than 80% provided that a proper patient selection criteria will be performed. Safety Electrochemotherapy employs lower dosages of chemotherapeutic drugs than standard chemotherapy protocols; thus, the patient's burden usually associated to chemotherapy is not present. In the clinical use of electrochemotherapy, limited side effects related to bleomycin or cisplatin use are recorded. Provided that appropriate anesthesia is used for alleviation of the symptoms associated with application of electric pulses, the control of the pain level during the electrochemotherapy acceptable for the patients. Other than pain, which is limited to the treated tumor and surrounding tissue, muscle contraction during electric pulse delivery is the only other discomfort. There is also induction of a vascular lock by the type of pulses used in electrochemotherapy: for a few minutes, blood flow is interrupted in the treated volume in the normal tissues. Its duration is too short to induce deleterious effects due to ischemia. In tumors however, vascular lock is of a longer duration and can contribute to the effectiveness of the electrochemotherapy. Veterinary use Electrochemotherapy is also used in veterinary oncology for a variety of tumors in dogs, cats, horses, and rabbits. There are centers in Brazil, France, Italy, Ireland, Slovenia, the UK,. There are now multiple institutions in the US including Maine, New York, Rhode Island, Washington, Missouri, South Carolina, Hawaii, Las Vegas, and the Bay Area of Northern California where this treatment is available. The success rate for electrochemotherapy has been stated to be around 90%, with an average of 3-4 treatments in the case of rabbits.

Nadaud's first career was as an accountant; he took up songwriting as a hobby at age 28. His friends encouraged him, and he submitted his work for publication in L'Illustration and Le Figaro. This genre of songwriting followed on from writers of the previous generation such as Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger. Many of his songs were political; his Pandore and Soldat du Marsala were both forbidden under the Second French Empire. Others were like simple folk songs, such as Carcassonne, which is the lament of a peasant who was never able to visit Carcassonne, a city on the Aude River near the Pyrenees, famous for its medieval fortress. Although Nadaud wrote over 300 songs, he died in poverty. A college in Wattrelos, in northern France, is named after him.

A part of the Dallas Independent School District, Wilmer-Hutchins High was formerly part of the now defunct Wilmer- Hutchins Independent School District. Located at 5500 Langdon Road in far south Dallas, the school serves students in grades nine through twelve. It serves portions of Dallas, most of Hutchins, Wilmer, a small portion of Lancaster, as well as unincorporated areas in southeastern Dallas County.\\"2015-16 Wilmer-Hutchins High School Attendance Zone Grades 9-12.\\" Dallas Independent School District. Retrieved on June 3, 2016. History Wilmer-Hutchins High School was originally established in 1928, after four smaller school districts consolidated. A new $60,000 campus was built on Highway 75, midway between Wilmer and Hutchins. The building was expanded in the 1950s with the addition of a large gymnasium and an annex housing a junior high school. The district's population grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s as hundreds of black families moved into new home developments located in the Dallas portion of the district. However, none of their children attended WHHS, as it was designated a \\"whites only\\" school. Black high school students were bused to Dallas' Lincoln High School until 1964, when Wilmer-Hutchins opened John F. Kennedy High School and Milton K. Curry Junior High School in the northern portion of the district. The school district was forced by courts to integrate in 1968. Kennedy High School was closed after only four years (it was combined with its sister campus to form Kennedy-Curry Junior High School) and all high school students attended WHHS. White families began fleeing the district, and by 1972 the school's population was almost 100 percent black. In 1983, a new campus was built on Langdon Road in Dallas, north of Hutchins and closer to most of the student body. The old campus became C.S. Winn Junior High School, which was later used as an elementary school before being abandoned in the early 2000s. The school won the 1990 Class AAAA state football championship.[Dave Campbell's Texas Football, 2008 edition, page 362] From 1991 to 1996 the school had six different principals. In August 1995 the school district hired 60 new teachers for the school. By October 1996, 20 of those teachers hired remained.Korosec, Thomas. \\"Last in the Class.\\" Dallas Observer.

The origins of the storm are believed to have been from a decaying cold front in the Gulf of Mexico, which dropped light to moderate rainfall across the southeastern United States. Developing on July 14 near the coast of North Carolina, Arthur tracked quickly east-northward through much of its duration as a tropical cyclone. It reached peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) on July 16, though as it interacted with a mid-level cyclone and cooler waters it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The remnants of Arthur passed over Newfoundland with gusty winds and rainfall, where one person drowned. Arthur was the first tropical storm to form in the month of July since Alex of 1998. Meteorological history The origins of Tropical Storm Arthur are believed to have been from a decaying cold front in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico in July 2002. By July 9, a weak low-level circulation was first detected, in association with a broad low pressure area. Across the region, surface pressures were high, while upper level wind shear was marginally favorable for slow tropical development. The system tracked slowly north-northwestward, gradually becoming better defined, although thunderstorm activity remained limited and disorganized. By July 11, dry air and unfavorable wind shear prevented the convection from developing near the center. The low became elongated, though on July 12 the overall convection became more concentrated as it turned to a northeast drift. An approaching mid-level trough caused the system to accelerate northeastward across Florida Panhandle, though upon doing so the thunderstorm activity quickly diminished. On July 13, forecasters expected the system to be absorbed by the approaching trough. However, the low pressure area emerged into the western Atlantic Ocean near North Carolina early on July 14, and upon doing so its convection increased and became better organized. The circulation and convection became further defined, and the National Hurricane Center estimates the system developed into Tropical Depression One late on July 14 about 45 miles (75 km) west-southwest of Hatteras, North Carolina. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was moving quickly to the east-northeast, due to a deepening mid-level low south of the Canadian Maritimes. It maintained good upper-level outflow, and its track over the gulf stream allowed for steady strengthening. Early on July 15, convection increased over the center and developed an organized rainband southwest of the center; as a result, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Arthur. After continuing to steadily intensify, Arthur attained peak winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) early on July 16 about 490 miles (790 km) south-southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Upon reaching peak intensity, the convection had become well- organized over the center despite westerly wind shear. Subsequently, the center became separated from the area of deepest convection, and Arthur maintained its peak intensity as it began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone. The storm turned northward around the larger mid-level low, and by July 17 Arthur completed extratropical transition. Shortly thereafter, the extratropical remnants crossed eastern Newfoundland. On July 19, the remnants of Arthur turned to a southeast drift between Newfoundland and Greenland, and by late in the day its winds decreased to below gale force. Impact Rainfall Summary for Tropical Storm Arthur The precursor tropical disturbance dropped light to moderate precipitation in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, peaking at 4.49 inches (114 mm) in Weston, Florida. The system produced scattered precipitation across North Carolina, generally between 1-3 inches (25-75 mm). On July 16, Arthur passed north of Bermuda, where it brought gusty winds and 0.57 inches (14.5 mm) of rainfall. As an extratropical storm, Arthur produced gusty winds and dropped about 1 inch (25 mm) of rainfall in Newfoundland. Strong waves capsized a boat in the Conne River, killing one person. Five ships recorded tropical storm force winds in association with Arthur, of which two were when the storm was extratropical. Early on July 16, a vessel with the call sign Weston reported sustained winds of 51 mph (82 km/h) from the south-southwest, which was the strongest ship reported wind speed. As the storm approached Canada as an extratropical storm, a buoy reported an 8-minute average wind speed of 45 mph (72 km/h), along with a wind gust of 60 mph (97 km/h).

They speak the Kurmanji dialect of the Kurdish Language.This tribe is considered to be one of the 24 Kurdish tribesthose were moved from Iran to Karabakh and Zangezur by Shah Abbas I of Iran in the 16th century to fortify the borders of the Safavid Empire. Tatiana Fyodorovna Aristova gives some Sheylanli Kurdish family names such as Asadlar, Ismaillar, Nabilar, and Khudular in the book Kurdy Zakavkazia. The author mentions Sheylanli, Zerty, and Minkend among the poorest Kurdish communities of Azerbaijan in Lachin. Tribal Kurdish population in Lachin region In the 1920s, the Kurdish community in Azerbaijan was considerably diminished, when many of them moved to Armenia where Kurdish villages were created.Encyclopedia of World Cultures, David Levinson, G.K. Hall & Co. (1991), p.225 About the same time Azerbaijan's Kurds had their own region called Red Kurdistan in the Lachin region, which was to the West of Karabakh. In fact, Lachin with the principal towns Kalbajar, Kubatli and Zangelan and the administrative sub- divisions of Karakushlak, Koturli, Murad-Khanli and Kurd-Haji were mostly inhabited by Kurds.The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview, Philip G.

The problem is that the historical record of the Kurds in Azerbaijan is filled with lacunae.An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires, James Stuart Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas Charles Pappas, Greenwood Publishing Group, (1994), , p.409 For instance, in 1979 there was according to the census no Kurds recorded.The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview, Philip G. Kreyenbroek, Stefan Sperl, Routledge, , (1992), p.204 Not only did Turkey and Azerbaijan pursue an identical policy against the Kurds, they even employed identical techniques like forced assimilation, manipulation of population figures, settlement of non-Kurds in areas predominantly Kurdish, suppression of publications and abolition of Kurdish as a medium of instruction in schools. Kurdish historical figures such as Sharaf Khan of Bitlis and Ahmad Khani and the Shaddadid dynasty as a whole were described as Azeris. Kurds who retained 'Kurdish' as their nationality on their internal passports as opposed to 'Azeri' were unable to find employment. In the past, in what is currently West of Azerbaijan (which includes Lachin), Kurds lived with an uneasy rivalry with the Azeri Turks.Iran Under the Ayatollahs, Dilip Hiro, Routledge, (1987), , p.111 In modern time they harbor some animosity toward them who they associate with the Turks,Political Culture and Civil Society in Russia and the New States of Eurasia, Vladimir Tismaneanu, M.E.

Hamilton. Plot=Prologue= A faerie princess turned private investigator in a world where faeries are not only known to the general public, but are also fashionable, the title heroine is Princess Meredith NicEssus, also known as Merry Gentry. As niece to Andais, The Queen of Air and Darkness, she is a royal of the Unseelie Court. While her aunt tried to kill her as a child, she has since offered her the title as crown princess as the Court needs more heirs. =Summary= A Lick of Frost begins one month after the events of Mistral's Kiss. The opening chapters show Merry and her guards Rhys, Galen, Doyle, Frost, and Abeloec in a conference room, being questioned about the charges of rape against Rhys, Galen, and Abeloec. King Taranis has brought the charges on behalf of the woman allegedly raped by the aforementioned fey. The meeting ends badly, with Taranis losing what little control he had on his sanity, and one of the officers of Taranis' guard, Sir Hugh, telling Merry that he is going to force a vote among the nobles of the Seelie court to choose a new king, and he wants Merry to take Taranis' place. When Merry and her guards get home after taking a trip to the hospital (as Doyle and Abe got badly hurt from Taranis' attack), they call Aunt Andais to tell her of all that has happened- specifically the offer to rule the Seelie Court. Andais believes Merry already agreed to rule and abuses one of her guards (Crystall) in a sadistic rage. Eventually, Merry and her men convince Andais otherwise, but she still continues to abuse the guard in reaction to many of them leaving to join Merry. The series of mirror-calls end, and Merry finalises the coming together of her, Ash, and Holly for later that night. Night comes and Holly and Ash arrive, along with all of the Red Caps in tow. Jonty, a Red Cap that helped Merry fight in Mistral's Kiss, sheds a tear as Merry tells him she would bring the Red Caps into their power. She catches the tear on her finger and consumes it. This brings on the remaking of Maeve Reed's house into a sithen. Those of faerie who stand in that room with no faerie dog to keep them grounded, crumple to the floor. Some of the crumpled men are revived by one of the dogs, but Frost stays down. The creation of the sithen (faerie land) allows the ring of fertility on her finger to flare to life and Merry realises that she is pregnant with twins. Each twin has three fathers like in the story of Ceridwen. A phantom image of Merry's children appear by their respective fathers, Rhys, Frost, Galen, Doyle, Mistral, and Sholto. There is also a dimmer phantom image of a 3rd child (that has the potential to be born after the twins). Frost turns out to be the sacrificial king for the creation of the new sithen. Merry prays for him not to die, and he turns into a white stag and runs off. Merry runs to one of the gardens of her sithen to be alone and grieve the loss of Frost. While out there, Taranis (using illusion to appear as one of her guards) knocks her out and takes her to his bedroom back at the Seelie Court. It is assumed that he rapes her, and then believes he fathers her children. Hugh, some others at the Seelie Court, and Doyle (in dog form) sneak her out of the bedroom and into a press conference where she tells the press that Taranis made the Seelie woman (Lady Catarin) believe that it was Rhys, Galen, and Abe who raped her. However, it was all just an illusion of Taranis' making and the woman was in fact raped by other Seelie nobles working with him. Merry also tells them that she is pregnant, and that Taranis kidnapped and raped her. The book ends with Merry in an ambulance with Doyle, continuing to mourn Frost and her current situation. She is on her way to the hospital to treat the concussion she received from Taranis and to take a rape test. Characters=Major= A Lick of Frost features the following major characters: Andais - Queen of Air and Darkness, Merry's aunt, sister of Essus, and mother of Cel. Andais is a war goddess, and the sadistic Queen of the Unseelie Court. Founder of the royal male guard, The Ravens, who she has placed under a vow of celibacy that can only be broken by her or Merry. She is a sexual sadist and is widely believed to be insane. However, Andais appears to have the best interests of the Court somewhat at heart, and has sworn to abdicate her throne in favor of whoever (Cel or Merry) can demonstrate themselves capable of producing new sidhe children first. Her royal consort is Eamon. Doyle - Nicknamed \\"Darkness\\", former God of Healing, Captain and first in command of The Ravens. Once the Queen's \\"Darkness\\" and personal assassin, now part of Merry's guard. One of Merry's favorite lovers. Doyle is one half sidhe, one fourth hell-hound (Gabriel Ratchet, et al.), and one fourth part phouka. Frost - Also known as \\"Jack Frost\\", nicknamed \\"The Killing Frost\\", Lieutenant and second in command of The Ravens. Was the Queen's consort prior to Eamon (approx. 800 years ago). One of Merry's favorite lovers. He is prejudiced against the Seelie Court due to his poor treatment at that court, the other nobles being jealous of Frost's remaining power due to his continued presence in the minds of the humans. He was brought into Godhood for the first time by Merry, increasing his powers. Frost was originally the hoarfrost made \\"real\\". He was not sidhe-born but \\"re- made\\" by the Goddess and her Consort into a sidhe. He's moody and has a tendency to pout. Galen - Youngest guard in The Ravens, Merry's best friend since childhood, and one of her favorite lovers. His lineage is half-pixie and half-Unseelie sidhe. His powers include the subtle ability to have everyone like him. He has also gained power through Merry. Galen is extremely unpolitical, naive, and idealistic, but he is also the voice of simple reasoning for Merry. Fortunately, letting go of those naive and idealistic ideals is allowing Merry to survive. Kitto - Half-goblin and half-Seelie sidhe, his sidhe mother was raped during the goblin wars by a snake-type goblin. Kitto was given to Merry to cement her alliance with the goblins. He was brought into his sidhe-side powers (The Hand of Reaching) by Merry. Meredith NicEssus - Also known as \\"Merry Gentry\\", title heroine, Princess of Flesh and Blood, daughter of Essus, niece to Andais and Taranis. Merry is one fourth Seelie sidhe, one half Unseelie sidhe, one eighth brownie, and one eighth human. She is also mortal. Rhys - Also known as \\"Cromm Cruach\\", former God of Death, guard in The Ravens, and film noir buff. One of Merry's favorite lovers. He's regained some of his former power over life and death through Merry. Extremely prejudiced against the goblins due to having his face disfigured by them. Besides Galen, Rhys is the most comfortable and knowledgeable about the modern human world outside of faerie. Taranis - King of Light and Illusion, High King of the Seelie Court. Taranis is Merry's uncle on her mother's side. He is just as insane as Andais, actually more so because he no longer considers the wellbeing of the Seelie Court above his own. Taranis is infertile, just like Andais, but refuses to recognize his infertility. He is convinced that he can father a child with Merry. =Minor= \\"Onilwyn\\" One of the guards who chose to leave Queen Andais's court to go into exile with Merry. He is a friend of Prince Cel and Merry doesn't like him. He hopes to have sex with Merry and get her pregnant so he can be king. She refuses to let him into her bed, and when Maeve Reed's house is remade into a sithen he is one of the guards who is injured but none of the fairy dogs will heal him. Sir Hugh - One of Taranis's guards. Offers Merry an opportunity to become Queen of the Seelie court. Holly and Ash - Half-Seelie sidhe, half-goblin twins. Both have agreed to lay with Merry in order to gain sidhe powers. In return, Merry gains two more months of alliance with the goblins. Abeloec - Also known as \\"Abe\\", guard in The Ravens, one of Merry's lovers that has been accused of rape. He was brought back into power during Mistral's kiss. Mistral - Newly appointed Captain of The Ravens, former Storm God, major character in Mistral's Kiss. Merry laid with Mistral in Mistral's Kiss, however, he is not one of her regular lovers and is still attached exclusively to Queen Andais. Sholto - Nicknamed \\"Shadowspawn\\", King of the Slaugh (Dark Host), Lord of That Which Passes Between, Lord of Shadows, guard in The Ravens. Sholto is half-Seelie sidhe, half-nightflyer. Queen Andais calls him her \\"Perverse Creature\\". Merry laid with Sholto in Mistral's Kiss, however, he is not one of her regular lovers. External links *Official Site of Laurell K.

Hoping that this land could be filled with gold, Perfilyev agrees. A few more daredevils volunteer for the mission. The finally gathered crew consists of Ilyin himself, officer Evgeniy Krestovskiy, Perfilyev's servant Ignatiy, who is given a task of killing every other crew member in case they really find any gold, and Gubin, a Katorga runaway and a former doctor. After a long journey, they reach the volcanic land and meet the natives ‚Äì a tribe of \\"Onkilon\\". However they soon find out that the volcano is cooling down quickly, and the legendary land is about to start to freeze so that its unique ecosystem is doomed. Gubin chooses to stay with the Onkilons so as to share his knowledge and help them through the disaster, Ignatiy is killed, Krestovskiy falls from a cliff, and Ilyin has to return alone.

In return for his faithful service, Clemens was promoted to other important positions, including being twice consul and urban prefect of Rome. Arrecinus Clemens was born into an equestrian family from Pisaurum,. The inscription reveals his enrollment in the tribe Camilia, which encompasses Pisaurum. He or his father also held property in nearby Ariminum () being the homonymous son of Emperor Gaius' Praetorian Prefect. Clemens' sister was Arrecina Tertulla, the first wife of the future Emperor Titus. Despite being a member of the Senate, he was placed at the head of the Praetorian Guard in 70 by Vespasian's political ally, Gaius Licinius Mucianus, amidst concerns that the current commander, Arrius Varus, was growing too politically influential. Clemens held the position until June of 71, when Vespasian's son Titus replaced him. According to Tacitus, Clemens was chosen because his father, Marcus Arrecinus Clemens, had honourably commanded the Guard during the reign of Emperor Caligula.Tacitus, Historiae, iv.68 Following these events, Clemens held a suffect consulship in 73,Paul Gallivan, \\"The Fasti for A.

The emperor Domitian invited Clemens to accompany him on a drive; as they passed a person both recognized, Domitian turned to Clemens and asked, \\"Shall we listen to that rascally fellow tomorrow?\\" The next day the \\"rascally fellow\\" was revealed to be a delator or informer who had brought charges on Clemens; the former Urban Prefect was found guilty and executed.Suetonius, Domitian, 11.2 However, Gavin Townend notes an inscription from Rudiae, in the extreme heel of Italy, on which one M. Arrecinus Clemens is commemorated by his wife Cornelia Ocel[lina],Eph.

It fed on sea- floor mud, evidenced by the frequent presence of sediments preserved in its gut. Along with the other Cambrian priapulids Ottoia, Selkirkia, Louisella, Ancalagon, Scolecofurca, and Lecythioscopa, the organism was originally classified into a clade termed the archaeopriapulida, a stem group to the Priapulids proper. However, the morphological similarity of these organisms to their modern cousins is remarkable, especially for the Burgess Shale, and their similarity to the modern genus Maccabeus suggests that they are in the Seticoronaria stem group, and thus are true crown-group priapulids. A phylogenetic analysis does not provide a great deal of resolution to the relationships between these basal worms. ReferencesExternal links * \\"Fieldia lanceolata\\". Burgess Shale Fossil Gallery.

Dick. It is increasingly used in academic literature to describe and criticise the tendency in criminal justice systems to focus on crimes not yet committed. Pre-crime intervenes to punish, disrupt, incapacitate or restrict those deemed to embody future crime threats. The term pre-crime embodies a temporal paradox, suggesting both that a crime has not occurred and that the crime that has not occurred is a foregone conclusion.McCulloch and Wilson 2016 Origins of the concept George Orwell introduced a similar concept in his 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four using the term thoughtcrime to describe illegal thoughts which held banned opinions about the ruling government or intentions to act against it. A large part of how it differs from pre-crime is in its absolute prohibition of anti-authority ideas and emotions, regardless of the consideration of any physical revolutionary acts. However, Orwell was describing behaviour he saw in governments of his day as well as extrapolating on that behaviour, and so his ideas were themselves rooted in real political history and current events. In Philip K. Dick's 1956 science fiction short story \\"The Minority Report\\", Precrime is the name of a criminal justice agency, the task of which is to identify and eliminate persons who will commit crimes in the future. The agency‚Äôs work is based on the existence of \\"precog mutants\\", a trio of \\"vegetable-like\\" humans whose \\"every incoherent utterance\\" is analyzed by a punch card computer. As Anderton, the chief of the Precrime agency, explains the advantages of this procedure: \\"in our society we have no major crimes ... but we do have a detention camp full of would-be criminals\\". He cautions about the basic legal drawback to pre-crime methodology: \\"We‚Äôre taking in individuals who have broken no law.\\" The concept was brought to wider public attention by Steven Spielberg's film Minority Report, loosely adapted from the story. The Japanese cyberpunk anime television series Psycho- Pass has a similar concept. In criminological theory Pre-crime in criminology dates back to the positivist school in the late 19th century, especially to Cesare Lombroso's idea that there are \\"born criminals\\", who can be recognized, even before they have committed any crime, on the basis of certain physical characteristics. Biological, psychological and sociological forms of criminological positivisms informed criminal policy in the early 20th century. For born criminals, criminal psychopaths and dangerous habitual offenders eliminatory penalties (capital punishment, indefinite confinement, castration etc.) were seen as appropriate.Leon Radzinowicz and Roger Hood: A History of English Criminal Law and its Administration from 1750 (1986), London: Sweet & Maxwell; pp. 231‚Äì387. Similar ideas were advocated by the Social Defense movement and, more recently, by what is seen and criticized as an emerging \\"new criminology\\" (Feeley & Simon 1992) or \\"actuary justice\\" (Feeley & Simon 1994). The new \\"pre-crime\\" or \\"security society\\" requires a radically new criminology.Fitzgibbon 2004Zedner 2007Zedner 2009Zedner 2010Zedner 2014 Testing for pre-delinquency Richard Nixon's psychiatrist, Arnold Hutschnecker, suggested, in a memorandum to the then president, to run mass tests of \\"pre-delinquency\\" and put those juveniles in \\"camps\\". Hutschnecker, a refugee from Nazi Germany and a vocal critic of Hitler at the time of his exodus, has rejected the interpretation of the memorandum that he advocated concentration camps: In criminal justice practice The frontline of a modern criminal justice system is increasingly preoccupied with anticipating threats, and is the antithesis of the traditional criminal justice system's focus on past crimes.McCulloch and Wilson 2016 Traditionally, criminal justice and punishment presuppose evidence of a crime being committed. This time-honored principle is violated once punishment is meted out \\"for crimes never committed\\".Anttila 1975, who criticised the measure of security detention Today, a clear example of this trend is \\"nachtr√§gliche Sicherungsverwahrung\\" (retrospective security detention), which became an option in German criminal law in 2004. This \\"measure of security\\" can be decided upon at the end of a prison sentence on a purely prognostic basis.Boetticher/Feest 2008, 263 sq. In France, a similarly retrospective measure was introduced in 2008 as \\"r√©tention de s√ªret√©\\" (security detention). The German measure was viewed as violating the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights in 2009. It was, however, never completely abolished in Germany and new legislation is envisaged to continue this practice under the new name \\"Therapieunterbringung\\" (detention for therapy).. A similar provision for indefinite administrative detention was found in Finnish law, but it was not enforced after the mid-1970s.http://plus.edilex.fi/stuklex/fi/he/20040262 Pre-crime is most obvious and advanced in the context of counter-terrorism, though it is argued that, far from countering terrorism, pre-crime produces the futures it purports to prevent.McCulloch/Pickering 2009.

Medieval Polish and Jewish chroniclers considered the legend as historical fact and report a wonderful love story between the beautiful Jewess and the great monarch. Legend 227x227px The first account of Esterka can be found in scripts of the 15th-century Polish chronicler Jan D≈Çugosz and recorded again, a century later, by the famous Jewish chronicler David Gans, who even maintained that Esterka was married to the king. Gans wrote: \\"Casimir, the king of Poland, took for himself a concubine - a young Jewess named Esther. Of all the maidens of the land, none compared to her beauty. She was his wife for many years. For her sake, the king extended many privileges to the Jews of his kingdom. She persuaded the king to issue documents of freedom and beneficence.\\" According to the legend, Esterka was the daughter of a poor tailor from Opoczno named Rafael. Her beauty and intelligence were legendary. She was later installed in the royal palace of Lobzovo near Krakow. 180x180px Esterka was said to have played a significant role in Casimir's life. In the legend, she performed as a King's adviser in support of various initiatives: free trade, building stone cities, tolerance to representatives of different religious faiths and support of cultural development. Casimir was loyal to the Jews and encouraged them. For many years, Krakow was the home of one of the most important Jewish communities in Europe. He was called The Great King for his intelligence and bright vision, which helped him to increase the size and wealth of Poland. During the years of the Black Death Esterka's influence helped to prevent the murder of many Polish Jews who were scapegoated for the disease. \\"Casimir the Great Arriving to the House of his Mistress Esterka\\", by 220x220px King Casmir had several wives, but Esterka was said to have been the only one who gave him male offspring despite the fact that they never were officially married. Their sons, Pelko and Nemir, were said in the legend to have been baptized on the request of their father. The two became the mythical ancestors of several Polish noble families. To develop legal and commercial relations between Jews, Poles, and Germans, Pelko was sent to Krak√≥w. In 1363, Nemir was sent to Ruthenia to establish a new knightly order, which later became the patrimonial nest of the Rudanovsky dynasty She also had two daughters brought up as Jews. After Casimir's death, his nephew Louis of Hungary became the King of Poland. During his reign, riots broke out against the Jews, especially violent in Krakow. According to the legend, rioters broke into Esterka's palace in Lobzovo and murdered her and her two daughters. Rudanovsky from Rudawa River was considered Esterka's burial. Places Esterka House Seweryn Udziela Ethnographic Museum in Krak√≥w is located at Krakowska street 46. Wawel Castle Several places such as villages, streets and monuments in Poland are named after Esterka including a street in Cracow and usually ones associated with her and the King. In some sources Esterka is presented as King's consort who actually lived with him at Wawel Castle. Royal Palace in ≈Åobz√≥w King Cazimir built a fortalicium on the trade route leading to Silesia. It was a castle with a tower whose function was to defend the city from the north. But according to the legend, the King built it for his beloved Esterka.

History  The band in 1967. In 1685 Charles II allowed the band to maintain 12 \\"hautbois\\" (oboe) players. His death in 1685 was so significant for the band that until the Second World War, the Bass Drummer (known officially as The Regimental Timebeater), wore a black armband in mourning of the king's death. The Band was given the freedom of the City of Lincoln on 8 May 2008. The \\"British Grenadiers March‚Äù is one of the most recognizable and memorable tunes in the world, part of Britain's musical heritage. One of the band's admirers during the 18th century was George Frideric Handel. He demonstrated this by presenting the march from Scipio to the regiment before he included it in his opera of that name when it was first performed in 1726. George II gave Handel the task of scoring the Music for the Royal Fireworks, most commonly performed with strings, for the king's own musicians, who were wind players from his foot guards. Handel would have likely come into contact with musicians from the Grenadier Guards during the first performance at Vauxhall Gardens in 1749. The band at the Garden at Buckingham Palace in 2019.

It is considered to be the first Jesus music group, and Marsha Stevens the mother of contemporary Christian music. Career=Beginnings= After becoming a born-again Christian, 16-year-old Marsha Carter was instrumental to leading her sister Wendy and friend Peter Jacobs to Christianity. Utilizing Carter's talents as a songwriter, the three formed a Jesus music group they called Children of the Day. With the addition of friend, singer and upright bass player Russ Stevens to the group, the band became a quartet and released their first album. Following the release of the album, Marsha Carter and Russ Stevens married. =Career= Released in 1971 on the Maranatha! Music label, the group's first album was titled Come to the Waters. In order to finance the project, the group borrowed $900 from Calvary Chapel pastor Chuck Smith in order to produce the album that included what would become the group's best-known song penned by Marsha Stevens, For Those Tears I Died. The well-received album was followed two years later by With All Our Love (1973). Two more albums by the group were produced on the Maranatha! Music label, Where Else Could I Go (1975), and Christmas Album (1975). The group later signed with Light Records, releasing, Never Felt So Free (1977) and Butterfly (1979), during which Jeff Crandall was brought in to replace the departed Peter Jacobs. It was after the release of Butterfly that the group disbanded. =The group's demise= After the release of Butterfly, Marsha and Russ Stevens divorced. Following their divorce, Marsha Stevens publicly announced she was a lesbian. In The Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music, editor Mark Powell referred to the incident as \\"Contemporary Christian Music's first official scandal\\". =Aftermath= Marsha Stevens founded her own ministry, BALM (Born Again Lesbian Music), in the mid-1980s and continues to write and record. Now going by Marsha Stevens-Pino, she is in a domestic partnership with Cindy Stevens-Pino; they both travel the United States with Stevens-Pino giving concerts in predominantly gay and lesbian and as well as gay-affirming churches and fellowships. Stevens-Pino also works to help develop the talents of up and coming LGBT Christian musicians through BALM's \\"UP Beat!\\" program. Peter Jacobs currently runs the Pete Jacobs Wartime Revue, a 16-piece big-band that performs live shows featuring hits of the 1930s and 1940s. He also heads the jazzy Pete Jacobs Quintet and the 1960s tribute band Class of '69. Jacobs also created and produced the Colby's Clubhouse television series for the Trinity Broadcasting Network. In 1974, Wendy Carter married the band's \\"roadie\\", Kit Fremin; they later had two children, daughters Jessica and Rebecca.

Located within the Central District, it falls under the jurisdiction of Gezer Regional Council and borders the villages of Ganei Hadar, Ramot Meir and Sitria. Founded in 1930, it is the first kibbutz established by Jews born in Eretz Israel. Kibbutz Naan is the largest kibbutz in Israel in terms of population. History=Classic era= The name of the village and the kibbutz derives probably from the Biblical town of Na'amah (Joshua 15:41).Carta's Official Guide to Israel and Complete Gazetteer to all Sites in the Holy Land. (3rd edition 1993) Jerusalem, Carta, p.343, (English) Na'an was the headquarters of Simon bar Giora, one of the Jewish leaders during First Jewish-Roman War in late 60s of the common era. =British period= The Na'an kibbutz was founded in September 1930 by 42 members of the Noar HaOved youth group, on lands purchased from the Palestinian village of Al-Na'ani. This is the first kibbutz founded by members of Noar HaOved, as well as the first kibbutz established by Jews born in Eretz Israel. Naan 1935 Kibbutz Na'an orange groves, 1938 Before the establishment of the state of Israel, the people of Na'an were active in both the British Jewish Brigade (two members of the kibbutz died in service during World War II) and the Haganah. Prominent Haganah leader and later Israeli parliament member Yisrael Galili was a member of the kibbutz and a large Haganah weapon cache was stored in a hidden cellar under one of the kibbutz houses. That cache was the largest cache not caught by the British Mandatory forces during Operation Agatha and kibbutz elders claim that Yisrael Galili (who evaded capture by the British) was spirited out of the kibbutz in the guise of a pregnant woman set to give birth. In 1948, Kibbutz Na'an became the newly formed IDF's headquarters for the operation to capture Jerusalem and the elders of the then-Arab city Ramla signed the formal surrender of the city on the kibbutz grounds. Arab Al-Na'ani became depopulated on May 14, 1948. Na'an 1945 1:250,000 Na'an (No'ar Oved) 1948 1:20,000 Economy=Agriculture= Over the years, Na'an's economy flourished. At first Na'an sustained itself mainly through agriculture, growing fruits and vegetables and boasting a successful large dairy farm and sheep farm. =Irrigation technology= As time progressed, Na'an went into field irrigation technology, as irrigation equipment has been high in demand in arid Israel. What began as a workshop has flourished and by the late 70s was one of the most successful factories in the Kibbutz Movement, producing sprinklers, micro-irrigation and other related equipment. Na'an Irrigation Systems is renowned for developing the underground sprinkler system. By the mid 1980s, growing competition and decrease in demand forced the factory into a considerable slowdown. After roughly 20 years of struggles, Na'an Irrigation Systems merged with Indian conglomerate Jain Irrigation in 2007. The new merged company,NaanDanJain, Irrigation Ltd., aimed to become the largest irrigation manufacturer in the world. After having acquired 50% of the company for in 2007, Jain Irrigation acquired the remaining 50% from the kibbutz in 2012 for an estimated . The sale of NaaDanJain to Jain Irrigation was criticized by the general manager of the Kibbutz Industry Association on account of worries that NaanDanJain would transfer its Israel-based operations outside of the country. =Privatization= During the 1980s, the kibbutz embarked on a process of privatization. Income is based on salaries paid directly to members of the kibbutz and gains from joint assets such as the irrigation factory are given as dividends (as the members of the kibbutz are considered stock owners despite not actually possessing stocks of the company). The kibbutz bases its own budget on community taxes paid by the members.

Club career Boomsma was born in Schagen, North Holland in 1879, and moved to Rotterdam in 1888. He started to play football on the streets, where he was noticed by Kees van Hasselt. He joined Sparta sometime around 1895. He would remain with the club until his retirement from football in 1907. A year later, in 1908, he was made honorary member of the club. Boomsma scored the only goal for Sparta in the league game against reigning champions RAP of Amsterdam on 29 October 1899. The match was the first charity game in the Netherlands, held to support the Boer cause in the Second Boer War. The match grossed 1,201 guilders and 51.5 cents. International career Boomsma was also part of the first Dutch national football team, that played against Belgium on 30 April 1905. He also played for the Netherlands in the return match in Rotterdam on 14 May 1905. These would remain the only matches Boomsma played for the Netherlands. Army career Boomsma volunteered to join the Royal Netherlands Army on 1 July 1898, and eventually became a Colonel of Infantry in Apeldoorn from 1936-1939. During the mobilisation period in 1939, he was commander of Fortress Holland with the headquarters at Jaarsveld. After the invasion, he became the commander of the Ordedienst for \\"Gewest Veluwe\\" in the underground army. The main purpose of this underground army was to maintain contact with the Dutch government in exile in London by means of coded radio transmissions. Because of these activities he was imprisoned 3 times and questioned by the Gestapo. The first time from 28 March 1941 until 19 January 1942 at Scheveningen. The second time from 21 March 1942 until 16 May 1942, again at Scheveningen. The third and final time from October 1942, first imprisoned in Utrecht, then transferred to Vught and finally to Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg, Germany where he died on 26 May 1943. His son, Evert Willem Boomsma, escaped to England on the 6 May 1941 in a stolen Fokker T8W seaplane landing at Broadstairs around 0830hrs. He actually carried with him the secret codes enabling London to communicate with the resistance. Willem remained in UK, serving with No. 320 (Netherlands) Squadron RAF for the remainder of the war and never saw his father again. He returned to the Netherlands in 1951.

It tells of three characters: Dan McGrew, a rough-neck prospector; McGrew's sweetheart \\"Lou\\", a formidable pioneer woman; and a mysterious, weather-worn stranger who wanders into the saloon where the former are among a crowd of drinkers. The stranger buys drinks for the crowd, and then proceeds to the piano, where he plays a song that is alternately robust and then plaintively sad. He appears to have had a past with both McGrew and Lou, and has come to settle a grudge. Gunshots break out, with both McGrew and the stranger killing each other, while \\"the Lady that's known as Lou\\" ends up with the stranger's \\"poke of gold\\". The poet was a Scotsman who came to Canada as a young adult, and was fascinated with the lives and landscapes of the Canadian Northwest where he went to work. Along with \\"The Cremation of Sam McGee\\", this poem was arguably his best known. It was the basis of a 1998 novel, The Man from the Creeks, by Robert Kroetsch, a longtime admirer of Service's works. It was also the inspiration for the 1949 song \\"Dangerous Dan McGrew\\" by Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians. Also it has been recalled in the fourth strophe of the song \\"Put the Blame on Mame\\", sung by Rita Hayworth in the 1946 film Gilda; the text claims that rather than being shot and killed, Dan McGrew was slain by Mame's \\"hoochy-coo\\" dance. Also, the poem was recited by Miss Marple in the 1964 film Murder Most Foul, as her audition to join a theatrical troupe. The character of Dan McGrew was based on William Nelson McGrew (1883-1960), who was born and raised in Guinda, California to Isaac and Nellie Ophelia (Thomas) McGrew and whose nickname was \\"Dangerous Dan\\". William McGrew had gone to the Yukon seeking his fortune during the Yukon Gold Rush. William McGrew and Robert Service were mutually antagonistic toward each other, and after one argument Robert Service is reputed to have said: \\"McGrew, some day I'll kill you.\\" Service achieved his goal by killing Dan McGrew in this poem. The poem's unique history as a spoken word piece was highlighted when US President Ronald Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney did their own alternating recital of the poem both in private meetings and in public.

Band 13, Teil 1 - Seite 461 ‚Äì 10 June 1834 in Heidelberg), was a German mathematician, geologist, natural scientist and engineer. Life Langsdorf was the son of Georg Melchior Langsdorff and Maria Margarethe Koch. His father was saltworks archivist and Hesse-Hanau Rentmeister (master of the bursary) (saltworks of Nauheim). He had a twin brother named Daniel Isaak. After finishing Gymnasium (secondary school) in Idstein in 1773, Langsdorf studied, among other things, philosophy, law, and mathematics at University of G√∂ttingen from 1774 until autumn of 1776 with Abraham Gotthelf K√§stner and then until 1777 at the University of Giessen. He then interned at the saltworks in Salzhausen, and subsequently devoted himself in Nidda, Hesse to the study of saltworks. He finished his doctorate in 1781 in Erfurt. In the summer semester of 1781, he was an outside lecturer at Giessen. For health reasons however, he decided against an academic career. He pursued a career in administration and became Rentmeister and land judge in M√ºlheim an der Ruhr. Starting in 1784, he was active as a saltworks inspector in Gerabronn (near Rothenburg ob der Tauber), which belonged to the margravate of Ansbach at the time. In 1798, he was given a full professorship in mechanical engineering at Erlangen. He taught there until 1804 and he subjected the 15-year-old Georg Ohm to a thorough examination of his knowledge of mathematics. Ohm and his younger brother were instructed in mathematics by their father. He refused an offer from Heidelberg in 1803 and accepted an offer to teach mathematics and technology at Vilnius University. In Russia, he and his family were elevated into the hereditary aristocracy.Volk (1934), p. 11. In 1806, he returned with the aristocratic descriptor von and became (with the help of his older brother Gottlieb, the governor of Dilsburg) full professor in Heidelberg. The mathematical physics class of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences admitted him to its ranks as a non-local member in 1808. Langsdorf left the University of Erlangen in early 1809 to take up a post in the University of Heidelberg. Karl Christian von Langsdorff had been a professor of mathematics at Heidelberg from 1806 to 1834.(He is relative with mathematician Christian Hugo Eduard Study) Langsdorf was also very interested in theological questions and published several works on this topic. His brother, Johann Wilhelm, made a name for himself as a specialist in the area of saltworks engineering.

The Henegar Center for the Arts=High school= The school building was designed by W.M. Christen. Construction began in 1919 and in the fall of 1920 the building opened. It was soon to become the first of three structures to stand on the site. The first high school class, consisting of only 13 students graduated in 1921. At its highest the enrollment reached 1400. In 1963 the school was named for former Principal Ruth Henegar (1950‚Äì1951). In 1975 enrollment reached an all-time low of 331 students and the decision to close the school was made.

The Melbourne School Complex has housed many things prior to becoming the community cultural center that it is today. In the late 60‚Äôs both outer buildings were closed as instructional buildings and the west building (Trinity Towers South now occupies this land) housed Brevard Junior College (now Eastern Florida State College). The center building (Henegar Center) was used by the school board and other county offices. In 1980 the West building was demolished to make room for Trinity Towers South, in 1983 a small group of local residents acted and formed a non-profit corporation- the Brevard Regional Arts Group (BRAG) and went to work to restore the two remaining buildings. In 1984 The North Building Cultural Center was granted a forty- year renewable lease and BRAG was deeded the buildings by the Brevard County School System. BRAG mobilized the community and was able to raise $2.5 million in cash and contributed services and began the task of restoring the main building. =Main Stage= In 1991, the Henegar Center for the Arts opened its doors with a 475-seat proscenium style theater designed by Peter Feller. This theater is called the Main Stage. The curtain was from the Broadway Musical The King and I. State-of-the-art sound and lighting equipment was installed in order to present the highest quality productions. The main building contains the main ballroom, reception room, courtyard garden room, a mirrored dance studio and two additional meeting spaces. The public spaces contain rotating exhibitions of work by local artists. =Upstairs at the Henegar= A black box style theater called Upstairs at the Henegar was added in 2014.

Arthur D. Shores, 92, Lawyer And Advocate for Civil Rights. The New York Times Legal career Shores passed the Alabama State Bar exam in 1937 and immediately began using his legal skills to support civil rights issues. In 1938, Shores successfully sued on behalf of seven school teachers who were denied the right to vote by the Alabama Board of Registrars. Shores was general counsel for the International Association of Railway Employees (IARE). In 1941 he took on the case of Steele v. Louisville & N. R. Co. in which B. W. Steele, a member of the IARE executive, argued that an agreement between the railway and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen was illegal. A whites-only railroad union could not exclude blacks and then deny them better jobs because they were not union members. He worked on this case with attorney Charles H. Houston, who argued it successfully in front of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1944. Shores represented black teachers in the Jefferson County School Board to receive the same pay as white teachers. Birmingham, Alabama residents viewing the bomb-damaged home of Arthur Shores on September 5, 1963. The bomb exploded the previous day, September 4, injuring Shores' wife. In 1955, Shores successfully argued before the U.S. Supreme Court in Lucy v. Adams to prevent the University of Alabama from denying admission solely based on race or color. Autherine Lucy became the first African-American to attend the school when she was admitted in 1956. On the third day of classes, a hostile mob assembled to prevent Lucy from attending classes. The police were called to secure her admission but, that evening, the University suspended Lucy on the grounds that it could not provide a safe environment. Shores' campaign in 1963 to integrate the Birmingham public schools brought violence to him and other residents. Shore's home was fire-bombed on August 20 and September 4 in retaliation for black parents registering their children at white schools. Eleven days later a bomb killed four girls at 16th Street Baptist Church. He argued before the Supreme court in the same year that the arrests of peaceful demonstrators in Birmingham should be ruled unconstitutional. During the 1960s, he became the first black member of the Birmingham City Council. In 1977, the NAACP honored Shores by awarding him the William Robert Ming Advocacy Award for the spirit of financial and personal sacrifice displayed in his legal work.

Upon completion at MJCs, ECP LTs must go on to finish a bachelor's degree before possibly serving as active duty officers or continuing a career in the reserve components. They must graduate within the next 24 months (waiver for one additional year may be granted by Cadet Command) after receiving early commission. While attending their 4-year university, ECP LTs will be serving in a non-deployable status. History Before 1966, a prospective officer in the United States Army could only gain an ROTC commission after being awarded a baccalaureate degree. However, to meet the manpower requirements of the Vietnam War, Congress approved a measure that allowed cadets at Military Junior Colleges who had completed all requirements of the ROTC Advanced Course to be commissioned as second lieutenants and called to active duty at the conclusion of their sophomore year. In the mid-1970s, the elimination of the draft and the anti-military backlash caused by Vietnam led to officer recruiting problems, especially in the reserves. To address these concerns, the ECP was revised in 1978. Cadets from four-year schools who had successfully completed Advanced Camp and Military Science IV, but who had not yet earned their four-year degree could also be commissioned, provided they were slotted against a valid lieutenant vacancy. Throughout the 1980s, the Early Commissioning Program played a major role in officer production. In some years, ECP officers constituted over 60% of all ROTC second lieutenants. The program is a major financial incentive for students who could receive their commissions early and serve as officers while still attending college. In 1984, the California Guard received 95% (74 out of 78) of its ROTC lieutenants from the ECP program. The Army Reserve had a similar experience. In 1991, the downsizing of the Army reduced officer production requirements, leading to the reduction of the Early Commission Program to only the Military Junior Colleges. These schools are Georgia Military College, Marion Military Institute, New Mexico Military Institute, and Valley Forge Military Academy and College. Notable graduates Gustave F.

Haynes is the dedicated and principled editor for The Baltimore Sun city desk. Character depiction Haynes is a dedicated, principled and experienced reporter who now serves as city desk editor of The Baltimore Sun. He has worked at the paper for many years; he claims to have dropped out of journalism school and worked his way up from the police beat and labor beat to his current position. He maintains several contacts within the Baltimore Police Department. Haynes is profane and unrefined and chafes with the management of The Sun. He is a reporter's editor and is quick to both compliment and criticize his team where deserved and likes to keep his reporters motivated. =Season 5= Haynes often smokes on the loading dock of the building with fellow veterans police reporter Roger Twigg, court reporter Bill Zorzi and State Desk Editor Tim Phelps. Haynes reports to Metro Desk Editor Steven Luxenberg and is required to manage a team of journalists including city hall reporter Jeff Price, general assignments reporters Scott Templeton and Mike Fletcher, Twigg and Alma Gutierrez on the police beat, ornery veteran Bill Zorzi and rewrite man Jay Spry, among others. Haynes is responsible for editing the stories his reporters submit, keeping them on deadline and in organizing the submissions for daily budget meeting with managing editor Thomas Klebanow. The budget meeting determines how much space each story is allocated and Haynes often calls for budget lines (short summaries of stories) from his staff so he can present them in the meeting. Haynes is also working with executive editor James Whiting on a prospective series of articles about the city school system. Haynes is upset at continuing cutbacks at the paper causing the closure of foreign bureaus and the loss of veteran reporters and their institutional memory. He is outspoken about the loss of their transportation reporter when The Sun is beaten to a story about city bus cutbacks by the Daily Record. He clashes with Whiting when the executive editor suppresses a story about the University of Maryland failing to meet its desegregation goals. Whiting refuses to run the story because he is friends with the Dean of Journalism, who assures him that the university's reputation is improving amongst black faculty and students. Haynes helps to identify and generate stories, including dispatching Twigg to report on a row house fire and noticing a zoning issue in a set of city council minutes that indicates a political scandal. While checking the minutes from a meeting Price has attended, Haynes notices the name of known drug dealer Ricardo \\"Fat Face Rick\\" Hendrix, who owns a strip club that is being relocated by the council. Haynes discerns that the city will lose a substantial amount of money on the deal, to the benefit of the drug dealer. He has reporters investigate and links the property exchange to campaign contributions from Hendrix to city council president Nerese Campbell. Haynes is even able to manipulate Campbell into revealing that there are further campaign donations that he has not recognized. When Klebanow congratulates Haynes on the story, he gives full credit to Price. Haynes rewards his team by taking them out for drinks. Templeton delivers a story about a mother of four who died of an allergic reaction to crabs. Templeton includes mention of a scholarship fund for the woman's children. However, Haynes later learns that the details of a correction by Templeton involving a scam being run by the mom's relative are phony. Haynes meets with Whiting's education piece team to discuss their approach to a series of articles on the subject. Haynes and Scott Shane argue that the school children face wider problems than a lack of funding for their education. Templeton disagrees and Whiting backs his view that a tightly focused story will be easier to read and will appeal more to their audience. Haynes is angry that they are focusing on one aspect of a larger problem but Whiting insists that widening the focus would dilute the impact of the story. Although he doesn't like the story idea, Haynes later tries unsuccessfully to revive the series as a project for Templeton (who he has become distrustful of), but is rebuffed by Klebanow and Whiting because they want Templeton to continue the \\"homeless serial killer\\" story. Haynes lies awake that night worried he has transposed figures in an article about activity at the port and phones Spry to check. He is relieved to learn that the details were correct. Templeton is assigned to write a color piece about the Baltimore Orioles' Opening Day. When Templeton delivers an unverifiable story about a disabled boy who would only give his nickname and was cutting class to attend the game Haynes is reluctant to run it because it violates the paper's policy on naming its subjects. Haynes is overruled by Whiting. Haynes is apologetic when Gutierrez's story about a home invasion triple homicide is cut in length and relegated to the metro section. Gutierrez also presents a story about a series of potentially linked murders of homeless men but the details are not sufficient for it to receive a great deal of coverage. Haynes is angry when Executive Editor James Whiting announces another round of buy outs and the closure of several foreign bureaus (including Beijing and Jerusalem) and questions why their funding is being cut when the newspaper remains profitable. Haynes is further disappointed when his friend and fellow veteran Twigg is manipulated into accepting a buy out. Haynes himself is told by Whiting and Klebanow that he is essential in managing the transitions in the newsroom. Norman Wilson, an ex-colleague and current advisor to Mayor Tommy Carcetti, leaks a story to Haynes about the Mayor's plans for the police department. Carcetti is going to force commissioner Ervin Burrell to resign and eventually replace him with colonel Cedric Daniels. Haynes offers the story to Templeton but reassigns it to Twigg when Twigg demonstrates in depth knowledge of Daniels' background. Haynes assigns Templeton to gather react quotes for the piece and is suspicious when Templeton comes up with an incredibly worded quote. Haynes presses Templeton for his source and he claims that it came from Nerese Campbell. After work Haynes drinks with Twigg and they discuss their reasons for getting into the industry and bemoan the current state of the paper. Haynes reveals that watching his father set time aside to read the paper each day convinced him of its importance and that he wanted to be a part of it. Twigg quotes H.L. Mencken and Haynes dismisses their predecessor, Twigg leaves telling Haynes that he forgives him. Haynes amuses the newsroom with running commentary on the press conference Carcetti holds to announce the transitions in the department. Klebanow wonders how much of Haynes' insight will filter into their coverage and Haynes comments that with the loss of Twigg it will be difficult to find sources to support a thorough analysis of the promotions. Klebanow becomes annoyed with Haynes' use of profanity and asks him to moderate it. Haynes' team are also forced to hurry to catch up when the lack of a daily city court reporter causes them to miss the development of the Clay Davis corruption investigation. Haynes is impressed with Templeton's work on this story. Eventually, Haynes begins to suspect that Templeton is fabricating his stories. When a homeless veteran confronts Templeton and Haynes about a combat story that he claims Templeton made up, he takes a trip to Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C. to talk to another vet, who confirms that the veteran is an honest man. Also, during a meeting with Nerese Campbell, she reveals that she was surprised to hear that someone said that Cedric Daniels had a hand in then-Commissioner Burrell's dismissal - a quote previously attributed to Campbell herself by Templeton. He confronts Klebanow, who stands by Templeton. Later, in an argument, Templeton throws a notebook which he says has all his notes in it - when Gutierrez takes a look at it, she discovers it is blank. She relays this information to Gus, who once again confronts Whiting. This time, he is sent back to the copy desk as punishment.

The monastery is roughly 50 km east of Rethymno and is built on the north slope of a plateau in the Tallaia mountains.ŒöœéœÉœÑŒ±œÇ ŒìŒπŒ±œÄŒπœÑŒ∂œåŒ≥ŒªŒøœÖ.

Its name stands for the ox-fold, composed from the Greek words Œ≤ŒøœçœÇ (ox) and œÉŒ∑Œ∫œåœÇ (fold) (œÉŒ±Œ∫œåœÇ in the Doric Greek dialect). History According to various historical sources, the monastery was in continuous use from the early 17th century until 1960, when the last of its monks died. In April 1676, Vossakos became a Patriarchical monastery (i.e. stauropegic), proclaimed by an act (sigillion) of Ecumenical Patriarch Parthenius IV. The monastery played an important role in the greater area of Mylopotamos and owned many pieces of land as well as establishments in the nearby villages of Sisses, Garazo and Dafnedes. It also contributed to the Greek Revolution of Independence in 1821 and the Cretan Revolution of 1866. This involvement resulted in the monastery being partially destroyed by the Turks. Later in the 19th century, the monastery was rebuilt through significant construction activities. The current main church (katholikon) was built in 1855, replacing an earlier one dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. The church is devoted to the Holy Cross () and celebrates on September 14 each year. Architecture The monastic complex is arranged in three wings around the main church which is situated on the east side of the central yard. It is a single-aisled, vaulted church that is characterized by simple artistic features. A fountain built in 1673 is located near the main church. The monastery's water supply system is complemented by two water-cisterns, collecting the water draining from the roofs with a system of pipes. The east wing of the monastery is determined by its monumental gate of 1669 and two small rooms. The south and west wings comprise the dining hall, kitchen, honey and wax workshops and the raki distillery. An open-air wine-press is located in the central wing. Current status After being abandoned for over 40 years, the monastery was reinstated in 1998. An extensive restoration project was undertaken by the 28th Ephorate of Byzantine Antiquities, funded by the municipality of Kouloukonas, the Region of Crete and the monastery itself. Today, about two thirds of the originally derelict buildings have been restored and works are still under way.

Scott Templeton is a fictional character on the HBO drama The Wire, played by actor Tom McCarthy. The actor joined the starring cast as the series' fifth season began. Biography Templeton is a young reporter who allows his extreme ambition to lead him to falsify stories. He has previously worked at the Wichita Eagle and the Kansas City Star. Templeton sees his current job as a general assignment reporter at The Baltimore Sun as a stepping stone to The Washington Post or The New York Times. His prose is reflective of his personality, and is often overwrought and exaggerated. Templeton's style is welcomed by Managing Editor Thomas Klebanow and Executive Editor James Whiting. =Season 5= Templeton is involved with breaking a story about a drug dealer making campaign contributions and receiving profitable property deals in return. He finds his role of preparing background information dissatisfying, and he speaks dismissively of the paper as a whole to his colleague Alma Gutierrez. Nevertheless, Templeton is eager to write a follow- up story and requests the assignment from City Desk Editor Gus Haynes. Haynes denies the request, as he has already given the story to city council reporter Jeff Price, but encourages Templeton to continue seeking stories. Templeton is part of a team led by Executive Editor James Whiting planning a series of articles about the problems with education. Templeton wins favor with Whiting when he backs Whiting's philosophy that the piece requires little context and should remain tightly focused on the schools themselves. Haynes unsuccessfully argues the alternative position--that more context increases the relevance and effectiveness of any story. Templeton is assigned the color story about the Baltimore Orioles' opening day game. He plans to write a story about a dedicated fan, but his canvassing does not garner anyone who fits that profile. When he returns to the paper he tells Haynes that his subject is a 13-year-old wheelchair-bound boy who wanted to attend the game but could not afford a ticket. Haynes is concerned by several of Templeton's claims, e.g., that the boy would only give his nickname (\\"E-Jay\\"). Haynes asks Templeton for more details, and Templeton claims E-Jay didn't want to give his name because he went truant from school in order to attend. He also says that E-Jay is an orphan who lives with his aunt in a neighborhood distant from the stadium and was disabled by a stray bullet. Haynes tries to verify the story by dispatching photographers to find the boy and checking the archives for a story about his original injury. When unable to corroborate Templeton's story Haynes confronts him a second time, and Templeton says he resents the implication that his work was fabricated. Haynes is forced to run the piece when Whiting gives Templeton his full support. Templeton also submits a story about a mother of four who has died of a toxic reaction to blue crabs. He claims the woman's sister is collecting for a fund to pay for the children's education. When buyouts are announced at the paper, Templeton comments to his colleagues that he hopes they will get rid of some of the \\"dead wood\\" in the newsroom. Haynes is perturbed by the perceived insult to his friend, veteran police reporter Roger Twigg, who has accepted a buyout. When Haynes gets news of a story about Police Commissioner Ervin Burrell's being forced to retire and replaced by Colonel Cedric Daniels, he offers the story to Templeton because of Twigg's impending departure. Templeton is not aware of Daniels, but Twigg recites a quick history of the subjects' careers and expresses an interest, so Haynes gives him the assignment, instead, and asks Templeton to canvass for react quotes to the story. Templeton is seen not making phone calls and then submits an incredibly worded quote. Haynes is again dubious about the material and asks Templeton for his source. Templeton reluctantly credits the quote to City Council President Nerese Campbell and claims that Twigg is not the only skilled reporter in the newsroom. Haynes accepts the quote for the piece. Templeton is pleased when he is offered an interview with The Washington Post and takes the day off to attend. When he first arrives he is eager to observe a budget meeting, but during the interview he becomes discouraged when his prose is described as overwrought, and he is unfamiliar with the stories that have most impressed the editors of the Post. They do not offer Templeton a position but do promise to keep his resume on file and ask him to reapply when he has more experience. As he leaves, Templeton's asked if he still wants to observe the budget meeting, but he now shows no interest in the meeting. Templeton returns to Baltimore disheartened. Haynes asks Templeton to assist Bill Zorzi in catching them up on a missed story about a local corruption charges against State Senator Clay Davis. Templeton is assigned to contact State's Attorney Rupert Bond, and Haynes later praises his hard work in preparing the story in time for the next edition. Templeton admits to Gutierrez that he was unsuccessful in his job interview and reverses his position on The Sun, stating that it is not a bad paper. Haynes is briefly impressed by Templeton when he hits the streets and writes an excellent profile of a homeless Gulf War veteran who suffers from PTSD incurred when an IED hit his patrol unit in Fallujah, Iraq. Templeton also claims in the same episode to have checked on a fraud case, and Haynes later finds out Templeton's explanation for the story doesn't check out. The vet later comes in and says Templeton lied about his story as well, saying such things as the vet was in a Black Hawk Down-level firefight and saying they had coffee instead of chocolate milk. Templeton says the vet has changed his story. To fact check it, Haynes goes to the Walter Reed Center in D.C. and talks to a wounded veteran who backs up the interviewed vet, saying he's not a liar. Templeton continues to fabricate information for the fake serial-killer case, hatched by McNulty, and the detective quickly realizes Scott is a fabulist. However, in the end Haynes and Gutierrez both receive demotions for questioning Templeton's work, while Templeton wins a Pulitzer Prize for his \\"reporting\\" on the homeless in Baltimore. Origins Critics have stated that Templeton is based on reporter Jim Haner. In January 2000, Haner wrote a story which the Sun retracted several days later due to inaccuracies. Show creator and writer David Simon, a former Sun reporter, stated that he believed that Haner invented quotes and events without punishment from his editors. The character also appears to reference some famous cases of journalists falsifying stories to advance their careers, such as Stephen Glass at The New Republic, Janet Cooke at the Washington Post, and Jayson Blair at The New York Times.

This article presents the \\"infinite\\" DMRG algorithm for the S=1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, but the recipe can be applied for every translationally invariant one-dimensional lattice. DMRG is a renormalization-group technique because it offers an efficient truncation of the Hilbert space of one-dimensional quantum systems. The algorithm=The Starting Point= To simulate an infinite chain, starting with four sites. The first is the block site, the last the universe-block site and the remaining are the added sites, the right one is added to the universe- block site and the other to the block site. The Hilbert space for the single site is \\\\mathfrak{H} with the base \\\\\\\\{S,S_z\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}\\\\equiv\\\\\\\\{1,1\\\\rangle,1,0\\\\rangle,1,-1\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}. With this base the spin operators are S_x, S_y and S_z for the single site. For every block, the two blocks and the two sites, there is its own Hilbert space \\\\mathfrak{H}_b, its base \\\\\\\\{w_i\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\} (i:1\\\\dots \\\\dim(\\\\mathfrak{H}_b))and its own operators O_b:\\\\mathfrak{H}_b\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathfrak{H}_b: *block: \\\\mathfrak{H}_B, \\\\\\\\{u_i\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}, H_B, S_{x_B}, S_{y_B}, S_{z_B} *left-site: \\\\mathfrak{H}_l, \\\\\\\\{t_i\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}, S_{x_l}, S_{y_l}, S_{z_l} *right-site: \\\\mathfrak{H}_r, \\\\\\\\{s_i\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}, S_{x_r}, S_{y_r}, S_{z_r} *universe: \\\\mathfrak{H}_U, \\\\\\\\{r_i\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}, H_U, S_{x_U}, S_{y_U}, S_{z_U} At the starting point all four Hilbert spaces are equivalent to \\\\mathfrak{H}, all spin operators are equivalent to S_x, S_y and S_z and H_B=H_U=0. This is always (at every iterations) true only for left and right sites. =Step 1: Form the Hamiltonian matrix for the Superblock= The ingredients are the four block operators and the four universe-block operators, which at the first iteration are 3\\\\times3 matrices, the three left-site spin operators and the three right-site spin operators, which are always 3\\\\times3 matrices. The Hamiltonian matrix of the superblock (the chain), which at the first iteration has only four sites, is formed by these operators. In the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic S=1 model the Hamiltonian is: \\\\mathbf{H}_{SB}=-J\\\\sum_{\\\\langle i,j\\\\rangle}\\\\mathbf{S}_{x_i}\\\\mathbf{S}_{x_j}+\\\\mathbf{S}_{y_i}\\\\mathbf{S}_{y_j}+\\\\mathbf{S}_{z_i}\\\\mathbf{S}_{z_j} These operators live in the superblock state space: \\\\mathfrak{H}_{SB}=\\\\mathfrak{H}_B\\\\otimes\\\\mathfrak{H}_l\\\\otimes\\\\mathfrak{H}_r\\\\otimes\\\\mathfrak{H}_U, the base is \\\\\\\\{f\\\\rangle=u\\\\rangle\\\\otimest\\\\rangle\\\\otimess\\\\rangle\\\\otimesr\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\}.

At the beginning you can choose the ground state and use some advanced algorithm to find it, one of these is described in: *The Iterative Calculation of a Few of the Lowest Eigenvalues and Corresponding Eigenvectors of Large Real-Symmetric Matrices, Ernest R. Davidson; Journal of Computational Physics 17, 87-94 (1975) This step is the most time-consuming part of the algorithm. If \\\\Psi\\\\rangle=\\\\sum\\\\Psi_{i,j,k,w}u_i,t_j,s_k,r_w\\\\rangle is the target state, expectation value of various operators can be measured at this point using \\\\Psi\\\\rangle. =Step 3: Reduce density matrix= Form the reduced density matrix \\\\rho for the first two block system, the block and the left-site. By definition it is the (d*3)\\\\times(d*3) matrix: \\\\rho_{i,j;i',j'}\\\\equiv\\\\sum_{k,w}\\\\Psi_{i,j,k,w}\\\\Psi_{i',j',k,w} Diagonalize \\\\rho and form the m\\\\times (d*3) matrix T, which rows are the m eigenvectors associated with the m largest eigenvalues e_\\\\alpha of \\\\rho. So T is formed by the most significant eigenstates of the reduced density matrix. You choose m looking to the parameter P_m\\\\equiv\\\\sum_{\\\\alpha=1}^m e_\\\\alpha: 1-P_m\\\\cong 0. =Step 4: New block and universe-block operators= Form the (d*3)\\\\times(d*3) matrix representation of operators for the system composite of the block and left-site, and for the system composite of right-site and universe-block, for example: H_{B-l}=H_B\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb{I}+S_{x_B}\\\\otimes S_{x_l}+S_{y_B}\\\\otimes S_{y_l}+S_{z_B}\\\\otimes S_{z_l} S_{x_{B-l}}=\\\\mathbb{I}\\\\otimes S_{x_l} H_{r-U}=\\\\mathbb{I}\\\\otimes H_U+S_{x_r}\\\\otimes S_{x_U}+S_{y_r}\\\\otimes S_{y_U}+S_{z_r}\\\\otimes S_{z_U} S_{x_{r-U}}=S_{x_r}\\\\otimes\\\\mathbb{I} Now, form the m\\\\times m matrix representations of the new block and universe-block operators, form a new block by changing basis with the transformation T, for example: \\\\begin{matrix} &H;_B=TH_{B-l}T^\\\\dagger &S;_{x_B}=TS_{x_{B-l}}T^\\\\dagger \\\\end{matrix} At this point the iteration is ended and the algorithm goes back to step 1. The algorithm stops successfully when the observable converges to some value.

Japan classifies the islands as part of Okinoshima, Oki District, Shimane Prefecture, and calls them . The Franco-English name \\"Liancourt Rocks\\" derives from Le Liancourt, the name of a French whaling ship that came close to being wrecked on the rocks in 1849. The Liancourt Rocks comprise two main islets and 35 smaller rocks; the total surface area of the islets being , with the highest elevation of found at an unnamed location on the West Islet. The Liancourt Rocks lie in rich fishing grounds that may contain large deposits of natural gas. Geography The Liancourt Rocks consist of two main islets and numerous surrounding rocks. The two main islets, called Seodo (, \\"Western Island\\") and Dongdo (, \\"Eastern Island\\") in Korean, and Ojima (, \\"Male Island\\") and Mejima (, \\"Female Island\\") in Japanese, are apart. The Western Island is the larger of the two, with a wider base and higher peak, while the Eastern Island offers more usable surface area. Altogether, there are about 90 islets and reefs, volcanic rocks formed in the Cenozoic era, more specifically 4.6 to 2.5 million years ago. A total of 37 of these islets are recognized as permanent land. The total area of the islets is about , with their highest point at on the West Islet. The western islet is about ; the eastern islet is about . The western islet consists of a single peak and features many caves along the coastline. The cliffs of the eastern islet are about high. There are two large caves giving access to the sea, as well as a crater. In 2006, a geologist reported that the islets formed 4.5 million years ago and are quickly eroding. Distances The Liancourt Rocks are located at about . The western islet is located at and the Eastern Islet is located at . The Liancourt Rocks are situated at a distance of from the main island of Japan (Honshu) and from mainland South Korea. The nearest Japanese island, Oki Islands, is at a distance of , and the nearest Korean island, Ulleungdo, is . Climate The Liancourt Rocks viewed from the North Owing to their location and small size, the Liancourt Rocks can have harsh weather. If the swell is greater than 3 to 5 metres, then landing is not possible so on average ferries can only dock about once in every forty days. Overall, the climate is warm and humid, and heavily influenced by warm sea currents. Precipitation is high throughout the year (annual average‚Äî), with occasional snowfall. Fog is common. In summer, southerly winds dominate. The water around the islets is about in early spring, when the water is coldest, warming to about in late summer. Ecology Japanese sea lions at Liancourt Rocks during Japanese sealing operation in 1934 The islets are volcanic rocks, with only a thin layer of soil and moss. About 49 plant species, 107 bird species, and 93 insect species have been found to inhabit the islets, in addition to local marine life with 160 algal and 368 invertebrate species identified. Although between 1,100 and 1,200 litres of fresh water flow daily, desalinization plants have been installed on the islets for human consumption because existing spring water suffers from guano contamination. Since the early 1970s trees and some types of flowers were planted. According to historical records, there used to be trees indigenous to Liancourt Rocks, which have supposedly been wiped out by overharvesting and fires caused by bombing drills over the islets. A recent investigation, however, identified ten spindle trees aged 100‚Äì120 years. Cetaceans such as Minke whales, orcas, and dolphins are known to migrate through these areas. =Pollution and environmental destruction= A view from one of the rocks on a calm day Records of the human impact on the Liancourt Rocks before the late 20th century are scarce, although both Japanese and Koreans claim to have felled trees and killed Japanese sea lions there for many decades.Íµ≠ÎØºÏùºÎ≥¥ (Gookmin Daily). \\"ÎèÖÎèÑ‚ÄòÏã§Ìö®Ï†Å ÏßÄÎ∞∞‚ÄôÏÉà Í∑ºÍ±∞ (New Evidence of effective control), 1890ÎÖÑ Ïù¥Ï†ÑÎ∂ÄÌÑ∞ ÎèÖÎèÑÏÑú Í∞ïÏπòÏû°Ïù¥ (Sea lion hunting before 1890) [26 July 2006\\"]Japan: Outline of Takeshima Issue There is a serious concern for pollution in the seas surrounding the Liancourt Rocks. The sewage water treatment system established on the islets has malfunctioned and sewage water produced by inhabitants of the Liancourt Rocks such as South Korean Coast Guard and lighthouse staff is being dumped directly into the ocean. Significant water pollution has been observed; sea water has turned milky white, sea vegetation is progressively dying off, and calcification of coral reefs is spreading. The pollution is also causing loss of biodiversity in the surrounding seas. In November 2004, eight tons of malodorous sludge was being dumped into the ocean every day. Efforts have since been made by both public and private organizations to help curb the level of pollution surrounding the Rocks. Demographics and economy The base that houses South Korean Police Guards on Liancourt Rocks' East Islet As of February 2017, there were two civilian residents, two government officials, six lighthouse managers, and 40 members of the coast guard living on the islets. Since the South Korean coast guard was sent to the islets, civilian travel has been subject to South Korean government approval; they have stated that the reason for this is that the islet group is designated as a nature reserve. In March 1965, Choi Jong-duk moved from the nearby Ulleungdo to the islets to make a living from fishing. He also helped install facilities from May 1968. In 1981, Choi Jong-duk changed his administrative address to the Liancourt Rocks, making himself the first person to officially live there. He died there in September 1987. His son-in-law, Cho Jun-ki, and his wife also resided there from 1985 until they moved out in 1992. Meanwhile, in 1991, Kim Sung-do and Kim Shin-yeol transferred to the islets as permanent residents, still continuing to live there. In October 2018, Kim Sung-do died, thus Kim Shin-yeol is the last civilian resident still living on the islands.Widow to remain sole Dokdo resident, authorities confirmhttps://www.cnn.com/2019/02/14/asia/south-korea- japan-disputed-islands-one-resident-intl/index.html The South Korean government gave its approval to allow 1,597 visitors to visit the islets in 2004. Since March 2005, more tourists have received approval to visit. The South Korean government lets up to 70 tourists land at any one given time; one ferry provides rides to the islets every day. Tour companies charge around 350,000 Korean won per person (about US$310 ).Life in Dokdo Cyber Dokdo Construction South Korea has carried out construction work on the Liancourt Rocks, by 2009 the islands had a lighthouse and helicopter pad,Vladivostok News report and a police barracks. In 2007, two desalination plants were built capable of producing 28 tons of clean water every day. Both of the major South Korean telecommunications companies have installed cellular telephone towers on the islets. History=Whaling= The oldest map depicting Liancourt Rocks.(\\"Matsushima Ezu\\", 1656, Tottori Prefecture) American and French whaleships cruised for right whales off the rocks between 1849 and 1892.Cambria, of New Bedford, Apr. 29, 1849, Nicholson Whaling Collection; Cape Horn Pigeon, of New Bedford, Apr. 19, 1892, Kendall Whaling Museum. =Sovereignty dispute= South Korea stamps depicting the Liancourt Rocks from 1954 Sovereignty over the islands has been an ongoing point of contention in Japan‚ÄìSouth Korea relations. There are conflicting interpretations about the historical state of sovereignty over the islets. South Korean claims are partly based on references to an island called Usan-do () in various medieval historical records, maps, and encyclopedia such as Samguk Sagi, Annals of Joseon Dynasty, Dongguk Yeoji Seungnam, and Dongguk munhon bigo. According to the South Korean view, these refer to today's Liancourt Rocks. Japanese researchers of these documents have claimed the various references to Usan-do refer at different times to Jukdo, its neighboring island Ulleungdo, or a non-existent island between Ulleungdo and Korea. The first printed usage of the name Dokdo was in a Japanese log book in 1904. Other key points of the dispute involve the legal basis that Japan used to claim the islands in 1905, and the legal basis of South Korea's claim on the islands in 1952. A South Korean police boat approaches the dock on Liancourt Rocks' East Islet. North Korea and South Korea agree that the islands are Korean territory and reject Japan's claim.

Logos The logos below are in chronological order. Image:Los Angeles Lakers logo.svgLos Angeles Lakers (2001‚Äìpresent) Uniforms=Minneapolis era= As the Minneapolis Lakers, their road uniform is powder blue with gold trim. It is notable that it featured the city name's abbreviation (MPLS) on their road uniforms; they later changed it to the team nickname in block lettering. Their home uniform is white with powder blue and gold trim, and features the team nickname. It was used from 1948‚Äì58. The original MPLS uniforms were later used as throwback uniforms in the 2001‚Äì02 and 2017‚Äì18 seasons. In their final years in Minneapolis, the uniforms were tweaked, eliminating gold; the uniform featured four stars surrounding the front of the jersey. The shade of blue used in the home uniforms was changed to royal blue. The powder blue version was used during the 2004‚Äì05 season as throwback uniforms. =Early Los Angeles era= Upon moving to Los Angeles in 1960, they retained the blue and white scheme. The uniforms now feature a cursive 'Los Angeles' lettering. The road uniforms were royal blue with white and powder blue trim, while the home uniforms were white with royal and powder blue trim. The shorts feature the wordmark 'Lakers' on either side of the leg. The uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 1996‚Äì97 and 2003‚Äì04 seasons. =Switch to purple and gold= In 1967, Jack Kent Cooke purchased the Lakers and moved to The Forum. Cooke made some drastic changes to the Lakers' look by outfitting them in purple (known as Forum blue until the early 1980s) and gold uniforms. 1967‚Äì78 The initial purple and gold look featured a slanted \\"Lakers\\" script and white numbers with either gold or purple drop shadows. With a few changes in the striping scheme, this look would be used by the Lakers until the 1977‚Äì78 season. The 1971‚Äì72 version of the gold uniforms were used as throwback uniforms in the 2010‚Äì11 season. However, this uniform featured sans-serif player names and a straight \\"Lakers\\" script, whereas the originals had serifed player names and a slanted \\"Lakers\\" script. 1978‚Äì99 The gold uniforms were overhauled prior to the 1978‚Äì79 season, switching from white numbers to purple numbers with white drop shadows. The new look was unveiled a year before Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers and Magic Johnson launched the Showtime era. During the early 1980s, the Lakers wore mismatched shades of purple in their uniforms. On most occasions, the jersey was rendered in a darker shade whereas the shorts were lighter in hue and vice versa. This color issue was corrected later in the decade. Before the 1986-87 season, changes were made to the uniforms when the number font changed and decreased in size. The \\"Lakers\\" script also realigned into a straight arrangement. The Lakers revived the \\"Showtime\\" gold uniforms as throwbacks during the 2007‚Äì08 and 2016‚Äì17 seasons. In a home game against the Boston Celtics on December 30, 2007, the Lakers wore short shorts to match their throwback uniforms in the first half before switching to the baggy-styled shorts in the second half. 1999‚Äì2018 Prior to the 1999‚Äì2000 season, the Lakers unveiled a new uniform set. The side stripes now extend towards the jersey, the drop shadows were removed, a modernized \\"Lakers\\" script was introduced, and white numbers returned to the gold uniform. At the time of its unveiling, Nike served as the Lakers' uniform provider along with several other teams. The enduring feature of this uniform was the \\"wishbone\\" collar, which was also adopted by the Dallas Mavericks, Detroit Pistons, Miami Heat and Toronto Raptors upon releasing their respective uniforms. =Alternate white uniform= In the 2002‚Äì03 season, the Lakers unveiled a white alternate uniform. The white jerseys were designed by Lakers owner Jerry Buss' daughter Jeanie Buss, in tribute to Chick Hearn, who was regarded as the voice of the team for forty years until his death in August 2002. Along with the unveiling of the white alternate uniform, the Lakers released a new alternate logo featuring the purple \\"L\\" outside a gold basketball. This logo was then placed on the purple and gold uniforms prior to the 2004‚Äì05 season. These jerseys are only played on Sunday games. =Hollywood Nights black uniform= From the 2013‚Äì14 to the 2016‚Äì17 seasons, the Lakers wore a black uniform that was inspired from the Hollywood night life. Dubbed \\"Hollywood Nights\\", the uniform was black with purple and gold trim. They debuted the uniform on the road against the Brooklyn Nets on November 27, 2013, and were used for select Friday home dates. A variation of the \\"Hollywood Nights\\" jerseys, featuring sleeves, was unveiled for the 2014‚Äì15 season. =Special uniforms= From the 2007‚Äì08 to the 2016‚Äì17 seasons, the Lakers wore special edition white uniforms for NBA's Noche Latina events. The uniforms were similar to the Sunday whites, but with the wordmark \\"Los Lakers\\". During the 2013‚Äì14 season, the Lakers wore a sleeved version of the Noche Latina uniforms, with \\"Los Lakers\\" in gold with purple trim, and greyscale patterns at the back. The Lakers wore special Christmas-themed uniforms as part of the NBA's Christmas games from 2012 to 2016. They wore the following one-off Christmas uniforms: *2012: Monochrome white uniforms with lettering in white with purple trim. *2013: Sleeved white uniforms with primary logo in chrome with purple accents. *2014: Modified home white uniforms with \\"L\\" alternate logo, purple numbers and purple nameplates. *2015: Cream uniforms with ornate lettering and numbers. *2016: Monochrome white uniforms with ornate lettering and numbers. =Move to Nike= For the 2017‚Äì18 season, Nike took over the league's uniform contracts and the NBA did away with the \\"home\\" and \\"away\\" uniform designation. The Lakers white jersey became the team's \\"Association\\" jersey (named as such because every NBA team has a white jersey), the gold became the \\"Icon\\" jersey, and the purple became the \\"Statement\\" jersey that each team has. In addition, Nike has a \\"City\\" uniform that pays tribute to each team's local culture and heritage. The Lakers' \\"City\\" uniforms are known as the \\"Lore Series\\" designed to honor its greatest players. In the 2017‚Äì18 season, their \\"City\\" uniform paid tribute to Kobe Bryant. The following season, the Lakers unveiled a new \\"Lore Series\\" uniform focusing on Magic Johnson. For the 2019‚Äì20 \\"Lore Series\\" uniform, the Lakers honored Shaquille O'Neal. 2018‚Äìpresent Just before the 2018‚Äì19 season, the Lakers updated and unveiled their new uniforms. The side stripes were removed from the gold \\"Icon\\" and white \\"Association\\" uniform (the shorts retain this feature), while black side stripes with gold and white trim flank the purple \\"Statement\\" uniform. In addition, drop shadows return to the uniform numbers for the first time since 1999. And in another first for the franchise, the Lakers will feature gold numbers with white drop shadows on the purple uniform, while the gold uniforms will return to purple numbers with white drop shadows. Notable uniform moments Even though the Lakers have traditionally worn purple on the road, gold at home and more recently white on Sunday home games, there have been a few instances where the Lakers eschewed tradition. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, the Lakers wore their classic gold uniforms for two away games: December 22 against the Philadelphia 76ers, and December 23 against the New York Knicks. The home team wore their white throwback uniforms. Similarly, they wore their 1971‚Äì72 gold uniforms for three away games: February 10, 2011 against the Celtics, February 11 against the Knicks, and February 13 against the Orlando Magic. With the exception of the Magic, the Lakers' opponents wore throwback uniforms for the occasion. In recent years, the Lakers occasionally broke out their gold uniforms for a few away contests against teams that wore their dark primary, alternate or throwback uniforms. But after Nike became the league's outfitter for 2017 and beyond, the Lakers were forced to use only their gold \\"Icon\\" and white \\"Association\\" uniforms on either home or away games for the first two months of the season, after which the purple \\"Statement\\" uniforms were added to the rotation. In another break from tradition, the Lakers wore their purple \\"Statement\\" uniforms for the first time in a home game on November 29, 2017 against the Golden State Warriors. Halfway through the 2019-20 NBA season, Kobe Bryant, was one of the victims of the 2020 Calabasas helicopter crash along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna, six other passengers, and the pilot. In honor of his legacy, a patch of his initials was placed above the Nike swoosh logo. Also, the patch is placed on the back ends of the Lakers' homecourt, and Kobe‚Äôs numbers on the sidelines, with his #8 near the Lakers bench, and his #24 near the visiting team‚Äòs bench. Upon entering the 2020 NBA playoffs, the Lakers decided to wear \\"Black Mamba\\" jerseys that had used in 2017-18 Los Angeles Lakers season, first used in Game 4 of the First Round against Portland Trail Blazers, which is exactly one day after Kobe's birthday. The team also announced that if the Lakers will advance to the next round, it will be included to the team's jersey rotation. The jersey included the number 2 jersey of Kobe's daughter Gianna above the Nike swoosh in a white heart shape.

Gutierrez is a fictional character on the HBO drama The Wire, played by actress Michelle Paress. Gutierrez is a dedicated and idealistic young reporter on the city desk of The Baltimore Sun. Biography Gutierrez joins the staff of The Baltimore Sun five months before the fifth season begins after working for the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She is eager for the chance to prove herself and is enjoying her new career. Her abilities have already caught the attention of city desk editor Gus Haynes. Gutierrez lives with her boyfriend. =Season 5= Gutierrez submits a story about a fire in a row house and is embarrassed in front of the whole newsroom by her editor Gus Haynes and copy editor Jay Spry, who take her to task over her use of the word evacuate. Gutierrez is also assigned by Haynes to get a reaction quote from drug dealer Ricardo \\"Fat-Face Rick\\" Hendrix after the editor notices a lucrative real estate deal between Hendrix and the city council. Gutierrez is sent to Hendrix's strip club Desperado and comes back with a strong quote. She receives a contributing line in the story for her efforts. Her colleague Scott Templeton is disparaging about the credit she received and the credentials of the paper as a whole but Gutierrez remains upbeat. Gutierrez usually covers the police beat and is excited when she reports on a home invasion and triple homicide. She awakes early the next day to look at her story in print, but is disappointed to find that it has been edited down and buried within the paper. Haynes tells her that it was a bureaucratic mishap, but her colleague Mike Fletcher tells her the piece was cut because of the area where the victims are from. Gutierrez is worried when buy-outs are announced to cut costs at the paper, but ultimately has more opportunities as veteran crime beat reporter Roger Twigg accepts a buy-out. Without Twigg's expertise and contacts, Gutierrez struggles to find sources to provide analysis for a story about Mayor Tommy Carcetti replacing police commissioner Ervin Burrell. Gutierrez also works with the city desk team to prepare a last- minute story about the Clay Davis corruption case which was initially missed because there is no daily city court reporter on staff. Production Paress is married to former The Wire star Larry Gilliard Jr., who played D'Angelo Barksdale. The part is Paress' first major role on screen, having previously worked primarily on stage. Paress submitted an audition tape expecting to be considered for a smaller role and was asked to play Gutierrez by executive producer and head writer David Simon. Paress describes her character as ambitious, principled and light hearted.

It was known for its high academic standard and strict school discipline. History On 8September 1952 St. Teresa's Parish priest Father Orlando's long-cherished dream - a primary school to accommodate Catholic boys - was materialized in the birth of St. Teresa's School. St Teresa's School was founded by Mrs. Maria Lourdes Bau in Hong Kong in 1952. Its first premises were situated in Boundary Street with only three bright and gaily decorated classrooms. In 1954 it moved into St. Teresa's Church compound at Prince Edward Road and remain at the same site till present. The number of pupils had since grown steadily from its original enrollment of 140 pupils to 450 pupils in 1957. There were two sessions: A. M. Session (English) and P. M. Session (Chinese). Both sessions comprised kindergarten and primary classes and were co-educational. The atmosphere in the school was a happy one, and individual attention to the students rules foremost in the daily routine of the staff. Its position in the church compound enabled St. Teresa's School to participate in all the church activities and to benefit unceasingly from the spiritual care and guidance of its supervisor and Parish Priest, Father Orlando and other Rev. Fathers of St. Teresa's Church. The STS School Logo was designed by Mrs. Maria Lourdes Bau's husband Mr. Bau when the School was set up. Mrs. Maria Bau was close to the Portuguese family community at the time, and STS recruited quite a large number of Portuguese teachers during the early decades in the 1950s, 60's and 70's. Principals Founding Principal Mrs. Maria Lourdes Bau (1952‚Äì1996) Second Principal Sister Cecilia Wong (1996‚Äì1998) Present Principal Miss Fang Po Ling (1998‚Äì2008) The first School Director was Rev. Father C. M. Orlando, the Parish Priest of St. Teresa's Church. Admission, study and graduation Since STS was a Catholic School, most of the pupils admitted or their parents were either Catholic or had a strong attachment to the Catholic Church. Many pupils who started Primary 1 would have come directly from the STS Kindergarten. STS used English as its primary teaching language for all subjects except the few directly Chinese-related ones. STS had two classes, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Catholic prayers were the norm at the beginning and ending of a day's class. In the earlier days, the classes were classified into English class and Chinese class. STS had had both local Chinese teaching staff from the start as well as westerner (many of them are Portuguese) teaching staff during the earlier period. However, over time the teachers became more localized. All teachers and staff at STS had been women, and the pupil male/female split ratio had been about 7:3. An average class size varied between 26 - 33 pupils per class. At her peak, STS had over 25 teachers and over 600 pupils. The school fees in 2007-8 were about HKD1,400-/month for primary school pupils and about HKD1,200-/month for Kindergarten pupils. STS attracted not only local Chinese pupils, but also had a smaller percentage of pupils from families of different nationalities including Portuguese, British, American, Swiss, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Indian and Indonesian etc. STS also saw a high percentage of her graduates entering other famous secondary schools in HK, like Wah Yan College, Kowloon, La Salle College, Diocesan Boys' School and Maryknoll Convent School. School Founder Mrs. Maria Lourdes Bau announced her retirement after serving 45 years as the Principal of the School. In 2002, STS celebrated its 50th Anniversary. An open group 'St Teresa's School, Kowloon' was created in Facebook with members reaching the important 600 mark in January, 2008. In June, 2008 the School was permanently closed after graduation of the final Primary Six Class, and two K3 Classes, after completing her 56 years of mission. The last STS Graduation Ceremony took place in June 2008 for the P6 Class (29 pupils) and two K3 classes (total 58 pupils). The Grand Re-union party for all STS Alumni, their parents and former Principals & teachers took place on school premises in the afternoon on June 28, 2008. Publications There has only been two publications made by the School to date. The first issue was published in 1956, to mark the 5th anniversary since the founding of the School in 1952. The magazine was named Teresian with pink colour paper cover. There was a total of 58 pages printed in black and white inside the magazine. The second publication was made in 2002, to mark the 50th anniversary since the founding of the School. It was a thicker issue of A4 size. The main colour of the cover and back cover was greenish, but without the word 'Teresian' on it. However, the third and probably the final publication will be made by the end of 2008 to mark the closing chapter of the School, documenting some interesting highlights in the School's 56 years of education mission.

A large part of the forest and open heath of the Quantock Hills is within the parish and it includes the hamlets of Plainsfield, Aley, Adscombe, Friarn and Bincombe. It is adjacent to Nether Stowey, north-west of Bridgwater. History Nearby is Dowsborough Camp (or Danesborough or Dawesbury), an Iron Age hill fort. Another Iron Age site at Plainsfield Camp may have been an enclosure for animals rather than a defended settlement. It is possible that a Roman road ran from here to the Quantocks, because the names Nether Stowey and Over Stowey come from the Old English stan wey, meaning 'stone way'.Dumnonia and the Valley of the Parret, Rev. W.H.P. Greswell (1922) By the 12th century the parish had both a church and the 'old castle precinct' on the Stowey 'herpath'. The castle may have been the caput of the estate of Alfred d'Epaignes at Stowey. It survives as a large, flat mound to the north of Over Stowey village. Over Stowey was part of the hundred of Cannington. The village was the site of six fulling mills and was a site for copper mining. Plainsfield was a centre for weaving and pottery, the manor having been held by the family of Admiral Robert Blake from around 1600. In the 1830s three-quarters of the land of the parish was bought by Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton who built Quantock Lodge as his home which later became a school. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the Non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District, which is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Religious sites William Holland kept a diary of his life as the vicar of the Church of St Peter and St Paul in the village from 1799 to 1818. The first recorded incumbent was in 1144. The 14th or 15th- century tower was largely rebuilt by Richard Carver in 1840. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. There was a 13th-century chapel of the Virgin Mary built at Adscome by the monks of Athelney Abbey who had an estate there - Adscombe Chapel.

Krasnaya palatka; ; ) is a joint Soviet/Italian 1969 film directed by Mikhail Kalatozov. The film is based on the story of the 1928 mission to rescue Umberto Nobile and the other survivors of the crash of the airship Italia. It features Sean Connery as Roald Amundsen and Peter Finch as Nobile. The script was adapted by Yuri Nagibin and Mikhail Kalatozov from Nagibin's novel of the same title. Nagibin couldn't complete the script due to a series of conflicts with the producer, who insisted on expanding the role of Claudia Cardinale, and it was completed by de Concini and Bolt. Plot The film begins in Rome many years after the expedition. Nobile has endured years of scorn for his actions during the disaster and its aftermath. He imagines his apartment turned into a court of inquiry against him, where witnesses and judges are his former crewmen ‚Äì including Captain Zappi, his navigator and his meteorologist Finn Malmgren. Also arrayed against him are Valeria, Malmgren's lover, Captain Romagna, one of the expedition's would-be rescuers, famed aviator Lundborg, professor Samoilovich, chief of the Soviet rescue mission, his pilot Boris Chukhnovsky, and Roald Amundsen who lost his life in the search for survivors of Nobile's expedition.QRZ As they try Nobile, the events of the expedition and its failure are depicted. The expedition is successful at first, but ends in disaster. The Italia is weighed down when ice forms on it. Colliding with the ground, the airship's gondola is torn away from its keel and the envelope containing the airship's hydrogen cells; freed of the weight of the gondola, the rest of the ship floats away and out of control, taking some of Nobile's crew with it.–°–µ—Ä–≥–µ–π –ù–µ—Ö–∞–º–∫–∏–Ω. –ë–æ–≥ —Å–ø–∞—Å –∏—Ö —Ä—É–∫–∞–º–∏ –±–µ–∑–±–æ–∂–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤ Nobile maintains control of the surviving crew who are now marooned on arctic pack ice. Rescue efforts are made by both Italy and the Soviet Union. Nobile's group is first found by Lundborg, a Swedish pilot who lands on the ice. The aviator insists he can only take Nobile. Reluctantly, Nobile agrees, sure he can best assist the rescue once he returns from the ice. These efforts are blocked: reaching the Italian ship Citt√† di Milano he finds that his superiors have stripped him of command for apparently abandoning his crew, and he is ordered confined to his room and have no role in the rescue. Desperate, Nobile contacts the Krassin, a Soviet icebreaker also searching for the survivors. Nobile implores Samoilovich, the Krassin's captain for help in rescuing the survivors. Unfortunately, the Krassin has sustained damage. Also, because the ice pack has drifted, Nobile cannot give the Krassin an accurate position for the survivors. Some of Nobile's crew - Zappi, Mariano and Malmgren - leave the camp in a group hoping to reach Kings Bay. Amundsen joins the rescue effort as well, but disappears, becoming another victim of Nobile's expedition. In the film, Amundsen explains that he died soon after his plane found the remains of the Italia, spotting what appeared to be survivors. The pilot, ordered to land, crashed and was killed. Amundsen survived the crash, but was nonetheless doomed, finding nothing to build shelter or fire with, no supplies and no hope of rescue. The men that had appeared to be survivors when seen from the air were already long dead. Back at camp, the ice begins to break apart, and the survivors there barely escape from the gondola before it sinks. Alone on the ice, Nobile's survivors find themselves at their bleakest point before finally spotting the Krassin on the horizon. As the ship nears for a rescue, the survivors see Zappi and Mariano waving at them from its deck. Malmgren, who had also joined Zappi, died before he could be rescued. Pressed for a vote, Samoilovich defends Nobile's actions, noting that his rescue of the survivors was a direct result of Nobile's escape to King's Bay. Neither can he fault Nobile's apparent lack of heroism because a captain has no right to risk his own safety by individual acts of heroism. The others quickly reach a verdict of guilty, but Amundsen discounts the verdict, finding each of the accusers unfit to judge for various reasons, including indifference to others and emotional sterility, but mostly for their bitterness. The accusers file out of Nobile's apartment, Amundsen being the last. With Amundsen, Nobile reveals his feelings of guilt for leaving the men on the ice. While Nobile admits that his decision to join Lundborg was based on a number of reasons, some correct while others were wrong, his first thoughts on entering Lundborg's plane were not of rescue, but of a good hot bath. Amundsen helps Nobile find peace by reminding him that his frailty is only a sign of humanity and not guilt.  Cast  * Peter Finch as Gen.

It was produced by Beryl Vertue and Elaine Cameron, directed by Simon Shore, and written by Lindsey Hill. The plot is about the severely autistic child Kyle Graham and the progress he makes when his parents adopt Thomas, a golden retriever. It is based on the true story of Scottish child Dale Gardner and his dog Henry.  Plot  Kyle Graham (Andrew Byrne) is a severely autistic child with limited communication skills, throws violent tantrums and is not toilet-trained. His condition tests the patience of his parents Nicola (Keeley Hawes) and Rob (Ben Miles). Nicola believes that the symptoms of Kyle's autism can be made less severe over time by attempting to integrate him with the world around him. Rob, however, believes that the best solution is to send Kyle to a specialist boarding school run by the charismatic and caring headteacher John Havers (Clive Mantle). Rob, who has not had sex with his wife for years, becomes more torn when family friend Rachel (Lorraine Pilkington) offers him casual sex. Nicola‚Äôs only respite is the unwavering support of her mother Pat (Sheila Hancock) and father Jim (Duncan Preston), who dote on Kyle and provide practical support when needed. Open-minded on autism therapies, Nicola reads about a child whose condition improved with the help of a therapy dog; Rob remains sceptical, believing that Kyle will either be terrified of the dog or oblivious to its existence. Kyle names his golden retriever puppy Thomas after Thomas the Tank Engine. Slowly, through Thomas, he learns about emotions and interpersonal relationships. Rob discovers that he can quell his son's tantrums by speaking in a different voice that Kyle believes is that of Thomas. Rob and Nicola's marriage improves and she becomes pregnant with her second child. Thomas falls ill and the couple fear that if the dog should die, their son will regress. However, he makes a full recovery. In the final scene of the film, Kyle acknowledges his parents for the first time and says that he loves them. Before the credits, an epilogue shows what happened to the real-life counterparts portrayed as characters in the film.

The route was opened jointly by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR;) and the North Staffordshire Railway (NSR) in 1869. It was part of an alternative link between Manchester and destinations south of Macclesfield. The line closed in 1970 and its route now forms the Middlewood Way, a trail used by walkers, cyclists and horse riders.  History  Bollington Station, looking north, in 1965. In 1840s and 1850s NSR was trying to find a route from Macclesfield to Manchester independent of the London and North Western Railway (L&NWR;), which insisted on any NSR traffic going via Crewe, thus ensuring a higher L&NWR; mileage and charges. In 1863 a Macclesfield businessman, Thomas Oliver, promoted a scheme for a local line from Macclesfield via Bollington to Marple where it would connect with MS&LR.; It was hoped the line would revive Bollington's cotton industry, carry the stone from quarries in Kerridge, and serve the collieries around Poynton. summer 1961 timetable The MS&LR; seized on this scheme because the company needed another line from which to start a possible independent extension line to London. In 1864, Parliament authorised the creation of the railway. Both the MS&LR; and NSR were empowered to subscribe ¬£80,000 each for its construction, and for its operation and maintenance once open. In response to such competition the L&NWR;, which surprised by the success of the MB&MR;'s proposal, quickly came to an amicable traffic agreement with the NSR. This deal negated the original purpose and urgency of the line because the NSR now no longer needed an independent route to Manchester as it could use L&NWR; lines. Under these conditions, and with a general trade depression of the mid-1860s, construction of the new line was very slow. On 2 August 1869 a single-track line opened for passengers only. Goods traffic started on 1 March 1870. In 1871 the line doubled tracked along its entire length. Initially there were five stations on the line: Marple (Rose Hill), High Lane, Higher Poynton, Bollington and Macclesfield. In 1879 a new station was opened at Middlewood (later renamed Middlewood Higher). In 1948, the line became part of the London Midland Region of British Railways). In 1960 Middlewood Higher closed. By the 1960s the line, like many others, it was considered to be a loss maker and was earmarked for closure under the Beeching cuts. On 5 January 1970, the section between Rose Hill (Marple) and Macclesfield closed to all traffic. The track was lifted in early 1971. Only Rose Hill remained in operation due to the high number of passengers commuting to Manchester Piccadilly. It is now a terminus for a spur off the Hope Valley Line. The stations at Higher Poynton and Bollington were demolished at around the same time. High Lane Station remained derelict for seven years after closure until being demolished in 1977. Bollington station goods yard is now the site of the Clough Bank industrial estate.  Middlewood Way  Since closure the trackbed has been turned into a \\"linear park\\" between Macclesfield and Rose Hill, Marple. The long distance footpath was officially opened on 30 May 1985 by Dr David Bellamy. The platforms of Higher Poynton station are still extant and have been turned into a picnic sites on the trail. The trail crosses over a small valley of the river Dean at Bollington via a curved 23 arch stone viaduct. The viaduct was originally slated to be demolished but after protests it was saved to form part of the trail.

He is considered as one of the best authors who have written in Slovene, and one of the best Slovene poets after Pre≈°eren. His political role during and after World War II made him one of the most controversial figures in Slovenia in the 20th century.  Biography = Early life and school = Kocbek was born in the village of Sveti Jurij ob ≈†ƒçavnici in the Duchy of Styria, then part of the Austro- Hungarian Empire, now in Slovenia. His father Valentin Kocbek was originally from the nearby Slovene Hills () area,Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 18 while his mother Matilda, n√©e Plohl was from the neighboring village of Sveti Toma≈æ in the Prlekija Hills. The couple moved to Sveti Jurij, where Valentin Kocbek worked as an organist in the local Roman Catholic church.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 18-19 Edvard was the second of four children.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 19 He attended the German-language high school in Maribor, where he witnessed with enthusiasm the takeover of the town by the Slovene volunteers led by general Rudolf Maister.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 21-22 He later switched to the Slovene language high school in Ptuj.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 23 During his stay in Ptuj, he befriended the later editor and priest Stanko Cajnkar and dramatist Ivan Mrak. His Slovene language teacher was Anton Sovre, the most prominent classical philologist and translator from Greek in Slovenia between the two world wars. Sovre was the first to discover Kocbek's literary talent and encourage him to write and to participate in the dramatic circle. He also developed an early passion for French language and culture. During the same period, he became active in the Catholic athletic club Orel. = Youthful activism = Kocbek (left) with a group of young Slovenian writers in Ljubljana, 1925. Left to right: Edvard Kocbek, Bogomil Hrovat, Slavko Grum, Anton Ocvirk, Josip Vidmar, Vladimir Bartol After graduating from the lower high school in Ptuj, he enrolled in the classical gymnasium in Maribor; he was the first generation of students who took their courses entirely in Slovene (before that, courses were still partially taught in German).Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 28 During his high school years in Maribor, he joined a group of young Christian socialists who wanted to continue the legacy of both the Slovene Christian socialist political activist and thinker Janez Evangelist Krek, and the Social democratic author Ivan Cankar. This young Catholic movement was inspired by the German Catholic theologian and philosopher Romano Guardini.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 26 They strove for a more authentic liturgy and religiosity, which would base on the believer's personal relationship with God; they rejected clericalism, social conservativism and capitalism, and demanded the development of a new social order, based on an ethically renewed individual.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 26-27 The group became eventually known as the \\"Crusaders\\" (), after the journal Kri≈æ na gori (\\"Cross on the Mountain\\"), edited by the poet Anton Vodnik, who became one of the spiritual leaders of the group.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 29-35 In 1925, Kocbek graduated from the Maribor gymnasium and went to a long excursion through Italy together with his close friend Pino Mlakar.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 29 Upon returning, he decided to enroll to the Maribor priest seminar; he however quit after two years and enrolled at the University of Ljubljana, where he studied French language and literature. In 1928, he became the chief editor of the journal Kri≈æ na Gori, which changed its name to Kri≈æ (Cross). He remained active in the Catholic youth movement. During this time, he also published his first poems in the prominent Catholic cultural magazine Dom in svet.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 38 Between 1928 and 1929, he stayed a year in Berlin, where he attended courses by Romano Guardini at the Humboldt University. There, he also established contacts with the local leftist, especially Marxist subculture.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 40 Upon returning to Yugoslavia and finishing his studies, he taught at elementary schools in Bjelovar in Croatia. In 1931, he received a scholarship to study in Lyon. He also visited Paris, where he met with the French thinker Emmanuel Mounier who introduced him to the personalist philosophy. For the rest of his life, Kocbek would maintain contacts with the circle around the French magazine Esprit, with which he felt the strongest intellectual affinity. Throughout his life, Kocbek maintained contacts with several French Christian left thinkers, most notably with the writer Jean-Marie Domenach. After his return to Yugoslavia in 1932, he was transferred from Bjelovar to Vara≈ædin, also in Croatia. He however maintained close contacts with Slovene intellectual circles. In 1935, he published his first collection of poems, Zemlja (Soil), a hymnic and modernist hommage to the stillness of the rural life. The same year, he married a Croat woman from Vara≈ædin, Zdravka Koprivnjak.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 63 In 1936, he returned to Slovenia, where he was employed as professor of French language at the Be≈æigrad Grammar School. = Anti-Fascist resistance = Kocbek (third from the right, in the back) with Marshall Tito (first from the right) and a group of Yugoslav Communist resistance leaders in Bosnia in 1944. In 1937, Kocbek wrote an article called \\"Reflections on Spain\\" (Premi≈°ljevanje o ≈†paniji), in which he attacked the Spanish clergy who supported the pro-Fascist forces of general Francisco Franco in the Spanish civil war. The article, published in the liberal Catholic magazine Dom in svet, caused a scandal among Slovene Catholics,http://zalozba.zrc-sazu.si/index.php?q=sl/node/191 which reached its height by the condemnation of Kocbek's positions by the bishop of Ljubljana, Gregorij Ro≈æman. As a consequence, Kocbek became the referential figure on the Christian left in Slovenia. In 1938, Kocbek founded a new journal, Dejanje (The Action), which soon emerged as one of the most influential journals in Slovenia.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 108-111 Between 1937 and 1941, Kocbek maintained an ambiguous position towards Communism: on the one hand, he rejected both \\"left and right totalitarianism\\",Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 110-112 on the other he maintained contacts with both Slovene Communists and the left liberal intellectuals around the journals Sodobnost and Ljubljanski zvon, in an attempt to establish a popular front against the Fascist threat. Shortly after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Kocbek was among the founders of the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation as member of its Christian Socialist group. After several months in underground during the Italian occupation, Kocbek joined the Slovene Partisans where in 1943 he was forced to agree to dissolve the Christian Socialist group within the Liberation Front and recognized the absolute primacy of the Communist Party of Slovenia within the Partisans. Just before the end of World War II, he was nominated as Minister for Slovenia in the interim Yugoslav government led by Josip Broz Tito. After the end of the war, he continued was given several other functions within the new Communist regime, all of them without any real power. = Removal from public life = In 1951, Kocbek published a volume of short stories, entitled \\"Fear and Courage\\" (Strah in pogum), in which he touched the issue of moral dilemmas in the Partisan fight during World War II. The Communist regime used the book as an excuse to launch a massive propaganda attack on his person, forcing him to completely withdraw to private life in 1952, placing him under surveillance until the end of his life. In the next decade, he was not allowed to appear in public, let alone publish his books or essays. During this time, he earned his living by translating. Among others, he translated works by Balzac, Guy de Maupassant, Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry, and Max Frisch. In the years of his isolation, Kocbek turned almost exclusively to poetry, where he explored philosophical and ethical issues in a modernist style. After 1964, Kocbek was allowed some more public appearance, and many of his poems were allowed to be published for the first time after 1952. His later modernist poetry became an important source of inspiration for the young generations of Slovene authors, including such leading figures like Dominik Smole, Jo≈æe Snoj, Toma≈æ ≈†alamun, Marjan Ro≈æanc, and many others. = The Zaliv Scandal = Following the 1975 Zaliv Scandal, the Communist regime launched another massive denigration campaign against him. The international pressure on Yugoslavia, especially the intervention of the German writer Heinrich B√∂ll, was most probably the main element that protected Kocbek from judicial prosecution.Detela, L; Kersche, P. (2004): Kocbek Edvard: Literatur und Engagement , Kitab, Wien He died in Ljubljana in 1981 and was buried in the ≈Ωale cemetery. = Persecuted figure = After his removal from public life in 1952, Kocbek was under constant surveillance of the Yugoslav Secret Police, the UDBA. His personal file (under the number 584), written from 1944 to 1981, has 4,268 pages of reports. Sixty- nine secret police officials followed Kocbek between 1952 and 1981. Many of Kocbek's close friends were hired by the police to spy on him: the most reports were written by the essayist Jo≈æe Javor≈°ek. In 1976, two of his closest friends, Viktor Bla≈æiƒç and Franc Miklavƒçiƒç, were arrested and placed on trial for belonging to \\"Kocbek's secret circle.\\" Kocbek himself, however, was never arrested, although he was interrogated by the secret police several times. Several of his personal files were stolen and were never recovered, and his apartment was wired. In the mid-1970s, during a renovation of their apartment, Kocbek's son Jurij Kocbek discovered a microphone hidden in the wall. Kocbek wrote a famous poem for the occasion, entitled A Microphone in the Wall (Mikrofon v zidu), in which he poetically juxtaposed technology to human activity. = Personal life = Kocbek was married and had three children. His daughter Luƒçka died in 1973 at the age of 34 because of a cerebral hemorrhage.Andrej Inkret, In stoletje bo zardelo (Ljubljana: Modrijan, 2011), 483 His older son Matja≈æ Kocbek (1946‚Äì2013), became a renowned poet and art theorist, and his younger son Jurij Kocbek (1949‚Äì2009) was a photographer and graphic designer. In addition to Slovene, Kocbek was fluent in German, French, and Serbo-Croatian, and knew Latin and ancient Greek.  Legacy and commemoration  In the 1980s, and especially in the 1990s, Kocbek's literary oeuvre became highly praised, and his role as a writer was positively re-assessed. In 1998, a street in Ljubljana's Be≈æigrad district was named after him,http://www.uradni-list.si/1/content?id=7182 A street in Celje is also named after him.http://zemljevid.najdi.si/search_maps.jsp?q=KOCBEKOVA+ULICA+5%2C+3000+CELJE&tab;=maps In 2004, the centenary of Kocbek's birth was celebrated with many events, culminating in an official state celebration with the Slovenian Prime Minister Anton Rop as the main speaker. A sitting statue of the poet was ceremonially unveiled in the immediate vicinity of the Tivoli Pond in Tivoli Park in Ljubljana. It is a bronze statue by the sculptor Bo≈°tjan Drinovec. The poet sits on a bank and looks at his double on a handhold of the bank.  Works = Poetry = * Zemlja (\\"Earth\\". Ljubljana: Nova zalo≈æba, 1934). * Groza (\\"Dread\\".

History In 1930 Oscar Benson and Colonel 'Bertie' Dickson purchased a small confectionery business at 164 Church street in Kensington, London, with the chocolates made in a tiny basement below the shop. They used the first syllable of each of their surnames to come up with the name Bendicks. A box of Bittermints In 1931 Benson's sister-in-law, Lucia Benson, came up with a dark chocolate so bitter that it was virtually inedible on its own, and combined it with a mint fondant that was so strongly flavoured with mint oil that it was also difficult to eat on its own. When the two parts were combined they produced a very palatable chocolate that they named Bendicks Bittermints. The chocolate coating contains 95% cocoa solids. By 1933, Bendicks was developing a reputation for quality and a new store was opened in the heart of London's exclusive Mayfair. Prominent among the visitors was the Duke of Kent, son of King George V, who visited for the renowned Bittermints. The company soon became known as Bendicks of Mayfair. In 1946 the business was sold to Mr. Edgar Lawley. By 1952 Bendicks had moved to a building which bridged St. Thomas Street and Little Minster Street in Winchester, Hampshire. This building, which has now been demolished and replaced by residential properties and garages, had been constructed in around 1890 and been used as The Winchester Temperance Billiards Hall. It had already acquired the business of William Cox & Son, manufacturers of Royal Winchester Chocolates (a name which has been discontinued), which had been located in St. George's Street, Winchester (now occupied by McDonald's). The reputation of the company and its products was further enhanced in 1962 when it was awarded the coveted Royal Warrant: \\"By Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen\\". The confectionery products were expensive but were all made with the finest quality ingredients. The main part of the business was chocolate coated confectionery and these were all hand dipped, giving a much thicker layer of chocolate, and the availability of female 'dippers' was a constraint on the growth of the business. They also produced confectionery products such as nougat and chocolate bars. A feature of Bittermints was that they could be purchased in 9 inch, 18 inch and 36 inch boxes (by the yard). In 1967 the business was moved to a purpose built factory in Moorside Road, Winchester. During the 1960s it had been acquired by Wood Hall Trust Ltd. (itself subsequently being acquired by Elders IXL, the Australian conglomerate, in 1982). In later years enrobing equipment was introduced allowing an increase in production. In the 1960s the business also owned a number of retail outlets in prestigious parts of London. Two were located in Wigmore Street and Sloane Street, both of which were also restaurants. The remaining shops were located in Bond Street, Throgmorton Street and Curzon Street (the latter trading under its own name of Supex Ltd.) Many of the products sold in these shops were chocolate confectionery packed in fine china (Wedgwood, Doulton etc.) so that the remaining 'container' became a useful quality object and customers could bring in quality china containers to have filled with confectionery to be given as gifts. Since 1988 Bendicks has been a subsidiary of the German sweet producer, August Storck.Storck ‚Äì Part of Your World ‚Äì Bendicks 21st century The brand diversified in 2002, introducing Mingles, an ultimately unsuccessful selection box of chocolates. On 18 April 2011, Storck announced its plan to move chocolate production from its factory in Hampshire to Germany, with the loss of 84 jobs; 30 marketing and sales jobs were to remain at the Winchester site. The decision was based on economic factors, namely a weak chocolate market and lack of profitability at the English factory.

By this time it was evident that while Alois developed normally, Anton suffered serious congenital health problems: he lagged in physical growth, his legs were weak and his spine deformed. His legal guardian reasoned that Anton was not fit for farm work; after completing an elementary school he sent Anton to \\"study commerce\\" in Klagenfurt. After five years of living and working at a grocery store A≈æbe ran away from Klagenfurt to Ljubljana. At some point in the late 1870s he met Janez Wolf, a Slovenian painter associated with the Nazarene movement who handled numerous church mural commissions.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 12. Little is known about A≈æbe's experience with Wolf, apart from the facts that in 1880 A≈æbe assisted Wolf with the frescoes of the Zagorje ob Savi church and, in 1882, with the facade of the Franciscan Church of the Annunciation in Ljubljana. In the same year Wolf helped A≈æbe with admission to the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where Anton studied for two years. He was dissatisfied with outdated, uninspiring Viennese training and barely made passing grades. In 1884 he relocated to the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, then a \\"liberal\\" and \\"modern\\" school as opposed to the conservative Viennese Academy.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 14. There he made a superb impression on his teachers Gabriel Hackl and Ludwig von L√∂fftz and earned a free scholarship. To make a living, A≈æbe teamed up with Ferdo Vesel, selling classroom works and run-of-the-mill kitsch scenes to wholesale dealers. Half of A≈æbe's surviving legacy dates back to the Munich Academy years; by the end of this period he was recognized as a professional portrait painter and was regularly exhibited in the Glaspalast. Wolf died in bitter poverty in 1884; later, A≈æbe frequently spoke that shortly before death (rendered by A≈æbe in chilling detail) Wolf dictated to him his last will ‚Äì that he, A≈æbe, must train a successor of Wolf's art, an ethnic Slovene who would surpass his seniors and strike the world with his genius. The free-of-charge training should last no less than eight years.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 13. For this purpose, said A≈æbe, Wolf entrusted A≈æbe with the \\"secret\\" of his art. It is not clear how much of the \\"Wolf's myth\\" is real; the \\"great Slovene painter\\" did not emerge and A≈æbe complained that all Slovene students, apart from faithful Matej Sternen, were leaving the school too early, preferring absolute freedom to the benefits of professional training. In 1892 Vesel and Rihard Jakopiƒç offered A≈æbe the informal job of examining and correcting the students' paintings.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 15. The seven clients rented a study room and paid A≈æbe for fixing their homework. Two months later, an inflow of new clients allowed A≈æbe to rent his own premises, starting the A≈æbe School. After a brief stay on T√ºrkenstrasse the school relocated to its permanent base at 16, Georgenstrasse in Schwabing (the building was destroyed by an allied air raid in July 1944). Later A≈æbe rented another building for the school classes and moved into his private workshop (also in Georgenstrasse).Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 37. The school was never short of students, with a normal complement reaching 80. The total number of A≈æbe alumni stands at around 150.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 38. Some, notably Alexej von Jawlensky, Matej Sternen and Marianne von Werefkin attended the school for nearly a decade. A≈æbe remained the sole instructor, except for a brief period in 1899‚Äì1900 when he hired Igor Grabar as an assistant.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 43. Long-established competitors, the Munich Academy and the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, recognized A≈æbe school and recommended it as a preparatory or \\"refreshment\\" course. In 1904 A≈æbe, a lifelong smoker, developed throat cancer and by the spring of 1905 he could hardly swallow food.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 19. Matej Sternen noted that the feeling of near death was obvious to all witnesses. A≈æbe agreed to a surgery that passed without immediate complications, but on 5 or 6 August 1905 A≈æbe died. The public transformed a sad but ordinary and expected event into a melodramatic urban legend. Leonhard Frank, who studied with A≈æbe in 1904,Heisserer, p. 189 reproduced the legend in Links, wo das Herz ist (1952): \\"Nobody ever saw his paintings. Nobody knew if he ever painted at all. Nobody knew his past. One chilly December night, intoxicated with cognac, he fell asleep in the snow. He was found dead in the morning. Nobody knew where he had come from.\\"Citing Russian translation in Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 19. A similar story was retold by Mikhail Shemyakin. The school of Anton A≈æbe survived its founder and existed until the onset of World War I.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 91. Personality The Harem, the last known work by A≈æbe. His opus magnum Odalisque has been lost (its existence attested by a single photograph made in 1902Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 23.). Modern understanding of A≈æbe's personality is based on the interpretation of biased and conflicting statements made by his alumni. A≈æbe never wrote for the public and never attempted to formulate his own teaching methods on paper. His letters to Alois were destroyed according to the family's will; the rest of his archive contained only business papers. The only evidence of A≈æbe's own handwriting is limited to three postcards and a letter to Sternen. It is not known if A≈æbe ever had a personal life; he himself mentioned that he was engaged twice, and both marriage attempts failed. There was some bond between him and Kathi Kobus, owner of the Simpli pub, but they both took the secret of this relationship to their graves.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 39. According to Sternen, he was consumed by a mysterious personality split that drove him into binge drinking and slovenly appearance. Likewise, Kandinsky wrote that A≈æbe's apparently unremarkable life was itself a mystery. Physically, A≈æbe was not a dwarf but still a man of a very short and irregular stature. Niko Zupaniƒç described him as having unusually short and weak legs, with a twisted upper spine. His head combined a large cranium with a disproportionately narrow face. Igor Grabar noted that his wide forehead was covered with a web of red pulsing veins; the rest of the face was uniformly red, as if in a fever; at the age of 33 A≈æbe seemed to be at least forty years old. He groomed his long chestnut moustache to the style of Wilhelm II. He always wore black, and of the best make; in winter his attire was complete with a tall oriental karakul hat.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 16. The oddly shaped and expensively (if not tastelessly) dressed schoolmaster, slowly walking with a cane and always smoking, became a target of tabloids and cartoonists. Boys taunted him on the streets, shouting \\"Atzpe! Atzpe!\\" (incorrectly pronouncing Slovenian A≈æbe in German).Grabar, chapter 6. A≈æbe's own German was not perfect either; he, particularly, abused the word n√§hmlich (\\"namely\\", \\"that is...\\")Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 18. and was called \\"Professor N√§hmlich\\".Leonhard Frank used the alias Professor N√§hmlich in his autobiographic fiction Links, wo das Herz ist. He normally spoke German in Munich but used Slovenian language in a Slavic company. A≈æbe never had a proper home, sleeping on an untidy sofa in a workshop filled with his students' paintings. He always painted in his studio and never ventured into open air painting. A≈æbe frequently spoke of his planned future masterpieces, none of which moved past the sketch stage. He left Munich only once, visiting Venice in 1897; otherwise, his life revolved between the school and local pubs. Their owners regularly allowed a drunken A≈æbe to sleep on their premises. With age he became more and more sedentary and replaced his daily walkouts with a circle ride on a tram. A≈æbe maintained ties with brother Alois but eventually severed all contacts after Alois' savvy wife reprimanded Anton for wasting too many matches lighting his cigars. The housewife's frugality was completely alien to A≈æbe, who never hesitated offering free tuition to students in needKuzma Petrov-Vodkin and the Burliuk brothers were admitted free-of-charge -Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 19. and lending them cash. An obituary noted that \\"he was a man of almost proverbial modesty... one of the most original and best-known personalities of Munich.\\"As cited, in English, by Selz, p. 176. A≈æbe as a creator The Village Choir, around 1900 Loyal students Igor Grabar and Dmitry Kardovsky noted portraits by A≈æbe for his \\"superb drawing\\"Russian: \\"–≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–æ–ª–µ–ø–Ω–æ –ø–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏ –Ω–∞—Ä–∏—Å–æ–≤–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞\\" - Grabar. marred by dry, if not dull, paint technique. Modern critics divide over A≈æbe's significance as a painter, not in the least because his surviving undisputed legacy is limited to twenty-six works. Eleven of these are early paintings and classroom studies from his college years. Only four paintings, dated from 1890 to 1903, can be considered mature art influenced by the Munich Secession.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 27. The largest and most complex of these, The Village Choir, has been irreversibly damaged by a botched restoration.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, pp. 23‚Äì24. Photographs and memoirs testify to the existence of his other works, now lost or hidden in private collections. Lack of hard evidence prompted conflicts among historians and critics, further aggravated by the politics of the former Yugoslavia and its successor states.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 22. Baranovsky and Khlebnikova noted that by the end of the twentieth century, A≈æbe the creator has become a myth, just like A≈æbe the person became a legend after his death. Frantz Stele (1962) and Peg Weiss (1979) have extensively studied A≈æbe's relationships with the emerging avantgarde art and mature impressionism, and considered A≈æbe to be a forerunner of modernist art, a link between C√©zanne and Kandinsky.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, pp. 54-56. Both studies, in particular Weiss', were rejected by Toma≈æ Brejc who reasoned that any parallels between A≈æbe and C√©zanne are moot because A≈æbe never mastered C√©zanne's technique and there is no evidence that he ever attempted it.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 58. A≈æbe as a teacher A≈æbe, himself a master of human anatomy (an 1886 class study pictured), enforced figure drawing studies that were bitterly resented by Wassily Kandinsky. Supporters (Igor Grabar) and opponents (Mstislav Dobuzhinsky) of A≈æbe training system agree that it relied, at least in the beginners' classes, on two paramount ideas: the Main Line and the Ball Principle (German: Kugelprinzip). A≈æbe discouraged beginners from focusing on minor details, instead forcing them to build the image around one bold \\"Main Line\\". He enforced drawing in black charcoal that enabled quick and radical corrections of the students' work. Dobuzhinsky admitted that these intrusions into his early work were an eye- opener, \\"an excellent tool against dilettante, myopic copying of reality...\\"Russian: \\"—ç—Ç–æ –±—ã–ª –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º –ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤ –¥–∏–ª–µ—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∏ –±–ª–∏–∑–æ—Ä—É–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ–ø–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞—Ç—É—Ä—ã...\\" ‚Äì Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 47. although for many students it spelled their end as painters: overwhelmed by the \\"Main Line\\", they did not dare to step over it and \\"beef it up\\" with relevant details.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 47. The Ball Principle, in its most practical application, portrait, stipulated that a human head is simply a sphere; reproducing lighting of a human head follows the same rules as reproducing a plaster ball. Facial features in this systems are merely protrusions and cavities of the ball's surface. Once the student mastered these basics, A≈æbe carefully led him to a different interpretation, that of a head as a polyhedron composed of flat surfaces and sharp ridges ‚Äì in Dobuzhinsky's opinion, a precursor to cubism. A≈æbe, himself a master of human anatomy, enforced rigorous training in this subject, from nude figure drawing to attending autopsies.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 46. Igor Grabar, who approved this approach, recalled that in the process he memorized all human muscles and bones by heart to the point where he easily reproduced them in plaster with closed eyes. Wassily Kandinsky, on the contrary, dreaded figure drawing sessions: \\"I quickly encountered a constraint upon my freedom that turned me into a slave, even only temporarily in a new guise ‚Äì studying from a model. Two or three models 'sat for heads' or 'posed nude'. Students of both sexes and from various countries thronged around these smelly, apathetic, expressionless, characterless natural phenomena who were paid fifty to seventy pfennig an hour... the people who were of no concern to them... they spent not one second thinking about art.\\"Kandinsky, Reminiscences, 1913, as cited by Shulamith Behr, p.133. Kandinsky, in his mature years, stayed aside from portraiture or nude figures, and his few rare examples were \\"featureless, weightless and transparent, a mere cipher without substance\\"Shulamith Behr, p. 133. ‚Äì an opposite of A≈æbe's own intentions.Shulamith Behr, p. 133, notes that \\"slavery\\" perceived by Kandinsky was \\"an ironic inversion of an academic artist's mastery or control over human body\\". Yet, Kandinsky also appreciated A≈æbe's view that no theory and no set of rules should subdue the artist's will, and quoted A≈æbe: \\"You must know your own anatomy but in front of an easel you must forget it\\".As cited in English in Boehmer, p. 209. Painting in colour was a distant target that required prerequisite mastery of line, shape and anatomy. All memoirists noted A≈æbe's aversion to mixing paints on a palette; instead, he recommended painting with raw paints and wide brushes.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 48. A wide brush covered with layers of different paints could, according to A≈æbe, paint a human forehead in a single powerful stroke, a skill that required years of rigorous, sometimes exhausting, training. A≈æbe frequently compared a proper oil painting to a diamond: raw paints must retain their independence, like the facets of a gem. A≈æbe himself adopted this style, later called \\"crystallization of colour\\", only in the middle of the 1890s.Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 49. While Igor Grabar praised this style and elevated it to a level of a whole system developing in parallel to impressionism, Dobuzhinsky (who never mastered the power stroke) called it \\"an artful magicians' trick... colourful but greasy painting devoid of its essence, the 'tone'.\\"Russian: \\"—ç—Ç–æ—Ç –ª–æ–≤–∫–∏–π –ø—Ä–∏—ë–º –∫–∞–∑–∞–ª—Å—è –º–Ω–µ —Ñ–æ–∫—É—Å–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º —Ç—Ä—é–∫–æ–º... –∫—Ä–∞—Å–æ—á–Ω–∞—è –∏ –∂–∏—Ä–Ω–∞—è –∂–∏–≤–æ–ø–∏—Å—å, –ª–∏—à—ë–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≥–ª–∞–≤–Ω–æ–≥–æ ‚Äì —Ç–æ–Ω–∞.\\" ‚Äì Baranovsky and Khlebnikova, p. 50.

She was a beauty queen and showgirl before appearing in 29 films between 1932 and 1940, and is mostly remembered for her roles as Princess Nadji in Chandu the Magician (1932) with Edmund Lowe and Bela Lugosi, and as Boris Karloff's and Lugosi's leading lady in 1935's The Raven. Early years Irene Ware and Bela Lugosi in Chandu the Magician (1932). Irene Ware and Bela Lugosi in Chandu The Magician (1935) Irene Ware in The Raven (1935) Irene Catherine Ahlberg was born November 6, 1910, in Albany, New York. Her father, Ernest Ahlberg, born in Sweden, managed a saloon. Her mother, Anna Freya, born in New York of Austrian parents, was a real estate agent. She lived in New York and Los Angeles. Her sister, Anita, was an artist. Beauty queen As an 18-year-old stenographer, (5\`6\\"/1.68 cm tall), Ware was crowned Miss Greater New York, then Miss United States in 1929, and the same year was first runner-up for the title of Miss Universe at a pageant held in Galveston, Texas. She also won $1,000. The winner, Austria's Lisl Goldarbeiter, was the subject of a TV documentary, \\"A Queen In Wien\\", released in 2006 and directed by Hungarian Peter Forgacs. (\\"Miss United States\\" was an unofficial alternative to the Miss America Pageant, which was not held in 1929. The Miss Universe contest of the 1920s was not connected to the current Miss Universe system, which was launched in 1952.) Acting Ware debuted on stage in a revue at the Metropolitan Theatre Boston in July 1929, She performed in Early Carroll's Sketch Book (1929) and in the 1930 and 1931 versions of Earl Carroll's Vanities on Broadway. She was then contracted to Fox Studios and moved to Hollywood, changing her name to Irene Ware. Her first movie was Society Girl, in 1932 at Fox Film Corporation as uncredited together with names like James Dunn, Peggy Shannon and Spencer Tracy. The second film, which quickly made her a star, was Chandu the Magician, also released in 1932 and directed by Marcel Varnel.

History  NREMT was established in 1970 in response to a recommendation from President Lyndon Johnson's Committee on Highway Traffic Safety that a national certifying agency for Emergency Medical Technicians be created in order to establish and standardize training requirements.NREMT History  Standards  Most states use or require NREMT testing for some level of state certification.Emergency Medical Technician from US Bureau of Labor Statistics\\"Emergency Medical Technicians\\" from University of Missouri, St. Louis NREMT recognizes four levels of EMS: EMR, EMT, EMT-Advanced, and Paramedic (some states may have additional certifications). NREMT certification at an EMT Intermediate level may or may not be sufficient for some state EMT-I requirements.Colorado EMT requirement overview While NREMT certification may be mandatory for new state certification, it is not necessarily required for renewals. These procedures and requirements vary from state to state. In 1986, military emergency rooms were required to certify all medical technicians through NREMT.\\"National Registry of EMT Certification of Air Force Emergency Room Technicians\\" from the Defense Technical Information Center Levels of certification=Nationally Registered Paramedic (NRP)= Highest level of certification through the NREMT. This represents the highest level of national certification. Paramedics are considered Advanced Life Support (ALS) and can administer a range of medication, as well as perform advanced electrical and invasive surgical interventions (please see Paramedics for a full list of skills.) In the United States, NRP Paramedics typically consist of a one year program or two year associates degree program consisting of over 1800 hours of didactic and clinical education focusing on acute emergency stabilization and prehospital care. =Nationally Registered Advanced Emergency Medical Technician (NRAEMT)= 1999 EMT-Intermediate National Standard Curriculum as defined by the Department of Transportation - National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)DOT Standards for EMT-I This level can also provide certain drug therapies. =Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technician (NREMT)= This level of certification provides Basic Life Support (BLS). (please see Emergency medical technician for a full list of skills) =Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Responder (NREMR)= This is the entry level into emergency medical services (EMS). They are trained in CPR, advanced first aid, automated external defibrillator usage, and patient assessment. Most police and fire services require their employees to be emergency medical responders at a minimum. This course is usually 40‚Äì60 hours in length.  EMS-ID  The NREMT launched the EMS-ID system on January 23rd 2020, modeled after the National Provider Identifier (NPI). The idea being that one identifier could be issued to a verified individual upon creation of an NREMT account, which could then reference all certifications for said individual. The number would remain constant, even if the individual changed their name, national certification level, ect. Similar to the NPI number issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the number is a 12-position, intelligence-free numeric identifier (12-digit number). The EMS-ID is not intended to replace the individual registry number. Controversy The NREMT has been criticized for failing to prevent cheating during some exams. The Washington, D.C. Fire Department was investigated for cheating on the NREMT certification exam; however, an extensive investigation by the NREMT, Pearson VUE (the test administrator), with assistance from the DC Fire and EMS department and the DC police, revealed no evidence of cheating at Pearson VUE‚Äôs LaPlata, MD testing center.

It comprised the area of the Ochota district of the city of Warsaw. Period of conspiracy activity Conspiracy activities in Ochota began in the end of 1939. They were organised by lieutenant Zygmunt ≈ª√≥≈Çtkowski pseudonym \\"Odwet\\" (\\"Revenge\\"), who acted in the framework of the S≈Çu≈ºba Zwyciƒôstwu Polski organisation (later renamed into the Armia Krajowa - Home Army). The formation of first units of the line was commenced in May and June 1940. Two platoons were created, each of them c. 30 people. The command of the 1st one was taken by second lieutenant Witold Daab pseudonym \\"Stefan\\" (Stephan), while the commandment of the 2nd one was taken by second lieutenant Stanis≈Çaw Chabros pseudonym \\"Dybowski\\". The 3rd platoon was formed in the mid 1941. It comprised c. 30 people commanded by lieutenant J√≥zef Stƒôpkowski. Since mid-1941 a quick increase of the effective strength of the units took place, due to recruitment carried by the ZwiƒÖzek Walki Zbrojnej, as well as by inclusion of military groups of other organisations struggling for Poland's independence. Organisation status in the eve of the Warsaw Uprising 1944 In summer 1944 the staff of the Area was composed of: * Commander ‚Äì lieutenant-colonel Mieczys≈Çaw Soko≈Çowski pseudonym \\"Grzyma≈Ça\\"; * Commander's deputy and chief of staff ‚Äì major Zenon Bayer pseudonym \\"Zenon\\"; * Quartermaster ‚Äì second lieutenant Micha≈Ç Karwacki pseudonym \\"Sowa\\"; The Area of Ochota included 3 regions (Pol.: rejon): *Region I ‚Äì commanded by captain Tadeusz Jasi≈Ñski pseudonym \\"Zych\\"; *Region II ‚Äì commanded by captain Eugeniusz Kosiacki pseudonym \\"Korczak\\"; *Region III ‚Äì commanded by lieutenant Andrzej Chyczewski pseudonym \\"Gustaw\\". The military strength of the Area was composed of c. 30 platoons organised into concentrations (groupings), battalions and companies. The effective strength of the Area amounted to c. 1,500 soldiers. The Area included also the Women Military Service (Pol.: Wojskowa S≈Çu≈ºba Kobiet) which amounted to c. 400 persons in sanitary and liaison units. Tasks assigned in case of uprising In case of uprising, the military units of the Area of Ochota ought to conquer the following: *barracks located in the Students' Hostel in Plac Gabriela Narutowicza, manned by c. 350 policemen of the Schutzpolizei; *barracks in the buildings of the Academy of Polytechnical Sciences (Pol.: Akademia Nauk Politechnicznych) and the Chief Office of State- owned Forests (Pol.: Dyrekcja Las√≥w Pa≈Ñstwowych), where a company of SS was stationed, c. 150 soldiers strong. The insurgent units were also to close and keep control of transit roads in that city district, thus covering Warsaw from south-east. Course of combat in Warsaw Uprising of 1944 On 1 August c. 600 soldiers turned up on places of concentration. Also, not the whole warfare to be in disposal of the Area's units arrived on place in time. In the face of a large advantage of the enemy in number and firepower as well as the loss of an opportunity to surprise the enemy, attacks taken up at the Hour \\"W\\" were not successful. Most of the units were withdrawn outside Warsaw. On 2 August the Battle of Pƒôcice was fought, in which c. 100 soldiers fell. Then the units withdrew to a concentration place in Chojnowo forests. Units, which remained in Ochota, assumed defence and created two redoubts: *'\\"Wawel Redoubt\\" (Pol.: Reduta Wawelska) ‚Äì in a quadrangle of blocks in the streets: Wawelska, Mianowskiego and Uniwersytecka - commanded by second lieutenant Jerzy Go≈Çƒôbiowski pseudonym \\"Stach\\"; *\\"Kalisz Redoubt\\" (Pol.: Reduta Kaliska) ‚Äì in the complex of buildings of the State-owned Tobacco Monopoly (Pol.: Pa≈Ñstwowy Monopol Tytoniowy) and adjacent buildings - commanded by lieutenant Andrzej Chuczewski pseudonym \\"Gustaw\\". The Wawel group bore in its positions until 11 August, when - in face of lack of ammunition and possibility to continue combat - withdrew through underground drains into southern part of ≈ör√≥dmie≈õcie district of Warsaw. There it was included into the \\"Iwo\\" reserve battalion and took part in its military actions. Since the beginning of September, as part of the \\"Odstoja\\" battalion, it repelled Germans advancing along Aleje Jerozolimskie. There it endured until the capitulation of the Warsaw Uprising. The Kalisz group fought in the region of Kaliska and Barska streets. It kept its positions until 10 August, when, having used up all possibilities to continue combat, withdrew to a concentration place in Chojnowo forests. After reorganisation and replacements, the unit commanded by lieutenant \\"Stach\\" returned to Warsaw and took part in combats in Wilan√≥w, in Sadyba, in Czerniak√≥w and in Mokot√≥w until the end of the Warsaw Uprising.

It is part of the high ground between Loch Monar and Gleann Fhiodhaig. Overview Maoile Lunndaidh is a large and remote mountain, covering an area in excess of 10 square miles (2,590 hectares). Its location is almost equidistant from the valleys of Strathconon, Strathfarrar and Glen Carron, the nearest public road being over 10 km away. The mountain is listed in the current edition of Munro's Tables as 1007 metres (3304 feet). This height dates from the introduction of the 1:50k OS map series in the 1970s. However the current 1:25000 map shows a spot height of 1,005 metres, in better agreement with the trigonometric height of 3293.8 feet on old 6 inch maps (equivalent to 1004.1 metres after conversion to the Newlyn datum). Maoile Lunndaidh has been described as ‚Äúthe flattest of bulks‚Äù.\\"Hamish‚Äòs Mountain Walk\\" Page 274 Gives quote: ‚ÄúFlattest of bulks‚Äù. Its extensive level summit plateau is reminiscent of the Cairngorm and seems out of place amongst the west coast peaks. The mountain has two impressive corries which cut deeply into the mountain on its NW and SE sides and are its most impressive geographical features. Maoile Lunndaidh translates from the Gaelic as ‚ÄúBare hill of the wet place‚Äù, with the mountain being especially boggy on its lower slopes. It lies near the headwaters of both the Strathfarrar and Strathconon glens and has several high lochans within its corries.\\"The Magic of the Munros\\" Page 153 Gives details of translation and meaning. Geography Maoile Lunndaidh's curving summit plateau is almost 2 km in length, never dropping below the 980 metre contour. Its flatness has led to confusion as to the highest point, with the location of the summit changing three times in Munro's Tables. The present highest point was originally named by Hugh Munro as the summit in 1891, in accordance with the 1881 6\\" map which shows a trig height of 3293.8 ft here and a spot height of 3293 ft at Creag Toll a‚Äô Choin 650 metres to the south west. Between 1921 and 1981 Creag Toll a‚Äô Choin was declared the MunroThe Munros and Tops 1891-1997. Spreadsheet giving changes to successive editions of Munro's Tables. after its height changed to 3295 feet on the 6 inch map. In 1981 the summit reverted to the original location when the 1007m spot appeared on the new Landranger map, a decision not without some controversy as Creag Toll a‚Äô Choin is the better viewpoint for Loch Monar. The latest 1:25000 map gives both points a spot height of 1005 metres. A 2014 survey clarified Creag Toll a‚Äô Choin was taller than Maoile Lunndaidh, and Maoile Lunndaidh's official prominence was reduced from 400 m to 10.5m. At the western end of the summit ridge stands C√†rn nan Fiaclan (Cairn of the teeth) with a height of 993 metres on the 1:25000 map. It is listed as a ‚Äútop‚Äù in the Munros Tables despite having only about 10 metres of prominence. The summit ridge follows the rim of two massive corries, the Fuar Tholl M√≤r (Big cold hollow) and the Toll a‚Äô Choin (Boggy hollow), which cut into the mountain from the NW and SE respectively. To the west the mountain is connected to the adjoining Munro of Sgurr a‚Äô Chaorachain by a col of height 605 metres, while to the east a col of 490 metres connects with the Corbett of An Sidhean. Fuar Tholl M√≤r has several small lochans nestling within it. On the eastern flanks of the mountain are the larger bodies of water of Loch a‚Äô Chlaidheimh and Loch nam Breac Dearga. The southern slopes of the mountain descend to the former site of Strathmore Lodge on Loch Monar, made famous by Iain Thomson in his book ‚ÄúIsolation Shepherd‚Äù. The lodge and over 60 other dwellings were flooded when the level of the loch was raised as part of the Hydroelectricity scheme in the late 1950s.\\"The Hydro Boys\\" Gives details of raising of Loch Monar level. All drainage from Maoile Lunndaidh is to the east coast of Scotland via the long glens of Strathfarrar and Strathconon, reaching the Beauly Firth and the Cromarty Firth. Ascents and summit The ascent of Maoile Lunndaidh requires a long day in the hills, though the terrain is straightforward. Most guide books recommend the route from Craig in Glen Carron because it is slightly shorter, and it is possible to use a bicycle as far as Glenuaig Lodge. Other mountain writers (Ralph Storer and Robin Howie) recommend the approach from Glen Strathfarrar because of the scenery. The approach from Craig starts on the A890 road at grid reference . A forestry track leads 10 km to the remote Glenuaig Lodge at the foot of Maoile Lunndaidh. From there the mountain can be climbed by following the west edge of the Fuar Tholl M√≤r corrie.\\"The Munros\\" Page 187 Gives details of ascent from Craig in Glen Carron. The approach from Strathglass is a 22 km round trip which starts at the Loch Monar dam (grid reference ), a 17-mile drive along a private road from the locked gate at Struy. Car access is permitted at certain times, but there is a quota on the number of vehicles entering the glen.Strathfarrar Access Arrangements This walk follows the north shore of the loch for 6 km before climbing the mountain by the south east ridge. The summit of the mountain is marked by a large cairn of grey boulders. The mossy, stony summit plateau can be a confusing place to navigate in mist.\\"100 Best Routes on Scottish Mountains\\" Page 124 Gives details of ascent from Strathfarrar.

It is well-known for its mucolytic agent, Fluimucil, used to treat respiratory problems. The company is currently run by Elena Zambon who is the daughter of the founder. Headquartered in Bresso, in the Province of Milan, the company has business operations in three continents: Europe, South America and Asia. The company employs approximately 2,600 people in 15 countries and its integrated organisation consists of Zambon Company SpA, the industrial holding company for the group which comprises Zach System (fine chemicals), Zambon SpA (pharmaceuticals) and Z-Cube (Research Venture). History=Origins= Gaetano Zambon, founder of the group, was born in Malo in the Province of Vicenza on 31 December 1878. His father Giovanni owned a corn business. Gaetano Zambon studied pharmacy at the University of Padua and graduated in 1902. Seeing the potential and growth of the pharmaceutical sector, he decided to sell products directly to pharmacies. Partnering with Silvio Farina, the two bought out the Rossi medical products warehouse on Corso Fogazzaro in Vicenza in August 1906 and officially founded the Magazzino Medicinali Zambon (Zambon Medical Products Warehouse) on 11 November 1906. =Establishment= The Warehouse distributed basic pharmaceutical products such as bismuth, iodine and bicarbonate, and also other commodities such as liquorice, spices and talcum powder. In 1908, the two partners established Gaetano Zambon & Co whose shares were divided equally between Gaetano, Silvio Farina and Teodorico Viero. In 1911, the business expanded over the entire region, forcing them to move to new offices. =The First World War= The outbreak of the First World War slowed business but did not halt it altogether. Gaetano Zambon provided services for the Military Medical Corps and during this period, partners Teodorico Viero, Silvio Farina and Arrigo Giacomelli expanded the company to include Giovanni Ferrari who also had a background in pharmaceuticals and sales. =The post- war period and establishment of ZeF= G. Zambon & Co. had a small plant that produced products for chemists such as Elixir di China (Elixir of Quinine), Ferrochina (iron and quinine citrate bitters), Rheum (rhubarb) and an insecticide called ITE. In 1920, Gaetano Zambon and his partners established their product lines, founding the first laboratory for speciality products and Galenic formulations, under the brand name ZeF (Zambon and Farina), for distribution to pharmacies and hospitals. In 1930, they bought an old fertiliser plant which was to become the company‚Äôs new pharmaceutical production facility. The first Synthetic Product Department was established in 1933, completing the pharmaceutical production process from raw material to finished product. =Zambon & Co. And the Second World War= In 1937, Gaetano Zambon and Silvio Farina were appointed Knights of the Order of the Crown of Italy and in 1938, after the departure of Teodorico from the company, they formed Zambon & C. Societ√† Anonima per Azioni (Zambon & Co. Join Stock Company), and increasing the number of employees from 100 to 300 within a decade. During the Second World War, the factory suffered heavy bombing on 14 May 1944 and much of it was destroyed. The new Zambon plant was opened in September 1946, with the Minister of Foreign Trade, Pietro Campilli in attendance. Pharmaceuticals produced by Zambon were also sold abroad. After the Second World War, the first generation of Zambon partners decided to hand over the reins to the younger generation. After parting ways with the Farina branch in 1951 and the Ferraris in 1957, Alberto Zambon took over the management of the company. Gaetano Zambon died in 1959 at the age of 81 years, and the company changed its name once more to Zambon SpA. Alberto Zambon established good relationships in the United States and with a few large multinationals existing at that time, especially in the field of research, so that the company could develop its own pharmaceuticals rather than licensing them. =Internationalisation= The company expanded abroad, setting up both production facilities and commercial operations. They opened the first production plant in Brazil in 1956 under the name Zambon Laboratorios Farmaceuticos SA, which was changed to Ltda in 1993. Zambon SA was established in Barcelona, Spain, in 1960 to serve the Iberian Peninsula (an independent Portuguese headquarters was opened in Lisbon, in 1992). The main brand of Zambon on the Spanish market is Ultra Levura, a probiotic treatment. In 1961, Alberto Zambon moved the main headquarters and research laboratories to Bresso, Milan, while the production facility remained in Vicenza. In 1963, Inpharzam was founded in Lamone, Switzerland, which served as a holding group for all the international businesses. This branch later moved to Cadempino, where a specialist pharmaceutical production plant was established. Davizam SA, Siphar and the Inpharzam Trading Company SA were also established in Lugano. Founded in the same year, Zambon France focused on sales and exports to Africa and Australia. Fluimicil went on the market in 1965. During this period, the company started to build relationships in Japan through a collaboration with EISAI, which produced injectable chloramphenicol in Japan. A new chemical ingredients plant was built in Almisano di Lonigo in 1970. In 1975, Zambon Colombia SA was established with headquarters in Bogota. In 1980, Inpharzam International established relationships with various companies, including Carlo Erba. In 1983, Zambon bought out Emilio Ghirardi‚Äôs company Simes and production was moved to a new plant in Vicenza in 1984. That same year, Zambon B.V. was founded with headquarters in Amsterdam and Zambon Nederland BV was established. A year later, Alberto Zambon was appointed a Knight of the Order of Merit for Labour, exactly 50 years after his father‚Äôs nomination. 1989 saw the founding of both Zambon UK and Zambon Corporation for the American market. In 1996, the Shantou Shanning Zambon Chemicals Ltd (Equity Joint Venture) was founded and its plant was opened a year later. In Europe, Inpharzam SA was established in Belgium in 1995. In 2000, a second Chinese plant was opened in Hainan, dividing chemical and pharmaceutical production between Shantou and Hainan. In 2002 Zambon India was established and Zambon Indonesia two years later. The group invested in the respiratory field, especially in the treatment of severe diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and rare illnesses, and in June 2013, Zambon acquired Profile Pharma in the United Kingdom, which specialised in cystic fibrosis. At the same time, Zambon entered the central nervous system therapy area with the molecule safinamide.

Career Haughey had attended Holyrood Secondary School followed by Langside College, and then worked in the refrigeration and air-conditioning industry in Abu Dhabi before returning to Scotland to set up his own business with ¬£70,000 of savings he had accrued. He founded City Refrigeration, a refrigeration equipment and maintenance supplier, with his wife Susan in 1985. City Facilities Management headquarters in Glasgow After securing a service contract with the Tennent's company in the 1980s which led to agreements with further breweries, he sold a majority stake to the 3i equity firm. A downturn in the financial situation caused Haughey to sell two other small companies he had established back to City to increase turnover and broaden the range of services provided by the firm. In 1997 the firm signed a deal with Asda to maintain refrigeration equipment in stores throughout the United Kingdom. Due to the success of that venture, Haughey and his wife found themselves able to buy back almost full control of City from 3i in 1999, allowing them to have decisive input on its future strategic direction; a gradual, continuous expansion of its operations followed over the subsequent decades. Haughey backed the Entrepreneurial Spark start-up accelerator, hosting the Glasgow 'hatchery' in his City Refrigeration Headquarters. While the City technical division is located in Clydesmill Industrial Estate near to Cambuslang, its corporate headquarters are at Caledonia House in Gorbals, Glasgow, having relocated from nearby Shawfield in 2009 when those premises were demolished for construction of the M74 motorway completion. The new site was virtually on the site of Haughey's childhood home which had been demolished years earlier with the family moving on to the newly built Toryglen neighbourhood a short distance to the south. By 2017, the company had been rebranded as City Facilities Management and launched a European arm, headquartered in Paris. Their international clients include Coles Supermarkets in Australia. In 2020, The high-profile investor Lord Willie Haughey, who helped rescue Celtic from busting in the early 1990s, flatly rejected suggestions that he was interested with an acquisition plan to Rangers. Personal life and awards Haughey married Susan in 1978. He has one son Kenny. In his spare time he enjoys playing golf and tournament poker. He once revealed that he winds down every Friday night with a fish supper. He is a Celtic F.C. season ticket holder and was formerly a non-executive director of the club. He was close friends with former Celtic player Jimmy Johnstone before his death, and is a collector of club memorabilia, much of which (including the medal collections of Johnstone and Tommy Gemmell) he has loaned back to Celtic for display in their museum. 2010 He also provided ¬£2 million in funding to the Scottish Cup while the tournament did not have a main sponsor between 2008 and 2010, with the Scottish Government allowed to use the 'branding space' competition to promote their Homecoming Scotland 2009 and Active Nation initiatives. He is a huge Oasis fan and has confessed to liking 80s band A-ha after a City employee offered him free tickets to an A-ha concert during the band's 2010 farewell tour. Haughey gave over ¬£5 million to charity over a five-year period. In January 2011 Haughey presented a cheque for ¬£100,000 to UNICEF ambassador Sir Alex Ferguson to support the charity's work with child flood victims in Pakistan.http://www.beattiegroup.com/prclients/pr-press- releases.aspx?news=31&id;=10839http://www.unicef.org.uk/Latest/News/Willie- Haughey/ In 2010 alone, he made charitable donations of ¬£1.3 million. He was awarded an OBE in 2003 and was knighted in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to business and philanthropy. On 1 August 2013, it was announced he was going to be a Labour peer in the House of Lords. Haughey has been named in several newspaper reports in connection with the resignation of Steven Purcell, the leader of Glasgow City Council until 2010. In 2011, Haughey had planning permission for the conversion of Greenleeshill Farm, situated on greenbelt land in South Lanarkshire, with panoramic views over Glasgow into a mansion resembling the White House US presidential residence. On 18 September 2013 he was created a life peer taking the title Baron Haughey, of Hutchesontown in the City of Glasgow. The 2017 edition of the Sunday Times Rich List estimated his family's fortune at ¬£265 million. In 2018, Haughey was reported as having become involved in discussions between the Scottish Football Association and Queen's Park F.C. over the future use of Hampden Park, the stadium used by the former but owned by the latter. With the SFA threatening to move their matches to Edinburgh and unwilling to pay more than ¬£2 million to buy Hampden from Queen's Park while the club demanded ¬£6 million, Haughey stepped in with an offer to 'split the difference' by adding a contribution to raise the purchase offer to ¬£4 million, in order for Scotland matches and cup finals to remain in their traditional Glasgow home. He had already donated funds to Queen's Park a decade earlier to help improve the facilities at their Lesser Hampden training ground, To play for the sake of playing, The Herald, 22 January 2009 which would become the first team match venue in 2021 once the sale of the main stadium was completed.Glasgow Football Club Kick Off 1,700-Seater Stadium Plan, reGlasgow, 20 November 2019 Also in 2018, Lord Willie Haughey has been elected overall winner of the \\"2018 EY Entrepreneur of the Year for Scotland\\".

Five people, four women and one man, were killed in the blast.The blast came six days after a bombing in the nearby town of √áe≈üme, which had left at least 20 people injured. Two months earlier, on 30 April, a police officer of Ku≈üadasƒ±, chief superintendent Ya≈üar Ayka√ß, had lost his life while he was trying to defuse, unprotected, a bomb placed in a plastic bag in the town square. The Kurdish group PKK was initially suspected of carrying out the bombing but they denied being involved in the attack. A suspect was arrested in ƒ∞stanbul on 8 April 2006. Victims Casualties included three Turkish nationals: Deniz Tutum (21), a native of Ku≈üadasƒ± on her way to work, Eda Okyay and Ufuk Y√ºcedeniz, both 23 and fianc√©es on a weekend excursion from ƒ∞zmir, and two tourists: Helen Bennett (23), of County Durham, England and Tara Whelan (17), of Waterford, Ireland.The Tara Whelan who died at Ku≈üadasƒ± should not be confused with the British Telecom engineer of the same name, who died in a telegraph pole accident in Bristol in May 2001 and who made the headlines during the ensuing prosecution brought against her employer by the CWU and the verdict pronounced in 2006. A total of fourteen people were injured, eight Turks and six British tourists. Seven people, including all but one of the British citizens, had their conditions judged serious enough to be transported to Ege University hospital in ƒ∞zmir. Deniz Tutum's funeral in Ku≈üadasƒ± was transformed into a mass gathering of which moving accounts were made. Tara Whelan's funeral in her hometown as well as the aftermath for all concerned was covered with emphasis by the national media in Ireland. A commemoration service was held for Helen Bennett, along with other British bombing victims of 2005, in Southwark Cathedral. The cases of Helen Bennett and of members of her family, several of whom were wounded in the same attack, were cited as examples during the process that led to the establishment in the United Kingdom in 2007 of a statutory fund through the Red Cross for overseas victims of terrorism; a previously existing scheme managed by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority making criminal injuries payments for UK attacks only.

He began his career in Scotland before moving to the United States. In the US, he won six consecutive National Challenge Cups with teams from both the American Soccer League and St. Louis Soccer League. He was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2005. Scotland=Greenock Morton= McNab began his career with Greenock Morton in 1916, playing five seasons with the team until his departure for the United States in 1924. World War I caused the loss of three seasons due to partial suspension of professional sports in Scotland. On 27 April 1922, Greenock won the Scottish Cup, winning in the final against Rangers.History of Greenock Morton In 1924, Morton offered McNab ¬£4 per week. He considered this excessively low, but when he asked for a transfer, the club placed a prohibitively high fee on him to force him to stay with Greenock. When McNab received an offer from the Boston Soccer Club of the American Soccer League to play for ¬£12 per week, McNab immediately left Scotland for the United States.National National Soccer Hall of Fame =National team= McNab earned two caps with the Scottish national team. His first was a 2‚Äì0 away win over Ireland on 26 February 1921 and the second was a 3‚Äì0 victory over England on 9 April 1921.Scottish FA Player Database United States=American Soccer League= McNab became an immediate success with the Boston Soccer Club. In 1925, the team defeated the Ben Millers of the St. Louis Soccer League in an unofficial national championship series. After finishing second in the league in 1926 and 1927, Boston finally took the ASL title in 1928 to go with their 1925 and 1927 league cups. By that time, McNab was partnered on Boston's front line with Billy Gonsalves and Bill McPherson, forming what was known as the \\"golden triangle\\". In 1928, McNab left Boston for the Fall River Marksmen. Over the next three season, the Marksmen took three league titles as well as the 1930 and 1931 National Challenge Cups. The 1931 Challenge Cup, pitting Fall River against Chicago Sparta was tied after two game, forcing a decisive third game.RSSSF Open Cup However, McNab broke his arm the day before the decisive game and Fall River was forced to play with ten men as they had failed to bring substitutes to Chicago.Time Magazine, April 27, 1931 In 1931, the Marksmen merged with the New York Soccer Club to form the New York Yankees. After one season, they moved to New Bedford, becoming the New Bedford Whalers. The Whalers proceeded to win the 1931 and spring 1932 seasons as well as the 1932 National Challenge Cup over Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C. (SBF) of the St. Louis Soccer League. =St. Louis= The Whalers victory over SBF in the 1932 Challenge Cup brought an offer from the SBF ownership to move west. McNab took the offer, inducing both Gonsalves and McPherson to join him at SBF. They formed the core of a team which took the 1933 and 1934 Challenge Cups. In 1934, St. Louis Central Breweries took over sponsorship of the team, renaming it appropriately enough, St. Louis Central Breweries F.C. In 1935, McNab won his sixth straight Challenge Cup with Central Breweries. That year the team was renamed the St. Louis Shamrocks. However, the Shamrocks withdrew from the SLSL, competing in the St. Louis Major League, the city's second division. In 1936, McNab and his teammates went to yet another National Cup final, falling this time to the Philadelphia German-Americans. In 1937, McNab went to his eighth straight National Cup final, losing this one to the New York Nationals. Following this loss, the Shamrocks where disbanded. McNab then signed with South Side Radio. In December 1937, McNab gained his release from South Side and signed with St. Matthew's of the SLSL, playing the 1937‚Äì1938 season with them. On 30 October 1938, he signed with Burke's Undertakers for the 1938‚Äì1939 season. =Coaching= The move to Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C. brought McNab into the coaching ranks. He immediately proved he was as good a coach as a player, taking SBF to two consecutive league and National Challenge Cup titles. Non- playing career In addition to playing and coaching soccer, McNab worked as an engineer in Scotland, and as a sporting goods salesman for the Stix, Baer and Fuller department store in St. Louis after retiring from playing. National Soccer Hall of Fame The National Soccer Hall of Fame inducted McNab in 2005 as part of a process of recognising significant pre-1950s players. According to the Hall of Fame, \\"We were aware that in the early decades of the Hall of Fame a number of outstanding players had slipped through the cracks of the selection process. In order to correct these oversights we established a Blue Ribbon panel consisting of historians Colin Jose, Roger Allaway and Hall of Famer Walter Bahr, to review the credentials of all Veterans from the pre-NASL era. Out of a total of 150 players who met the eligibility criteria, the panel unanimously recommended, and the Board approved, the special induction of these five players.\\" McNab was among the five selected. McNab died in 1960 when he suffered a heart attack playing golf. His son, Peter McNab later played in the second American Soccer League.

Fannius Hellanicus, (CILvi.17713) found its way into Pope Clement XI's shortlived Museo ecclesiastico , was noted in the Vatican Library and is today in the Capitoline Museums (Christian H√ºlsen, Il museo ecclesiastico di Clemente XI Albani, Rome, 1890, cat. no. 6). the Moroni vineyard, which revealed ninety-two funerary chambers decorated with frescoes and mosaics, which provided material for his Bolla d'oro (1736); the excavation was supported by Cardinal Filippo Antonio Gualterio, who purchased many of the antiquities discovered. Later Ficoroni bought back some of Gualterio's objects, while over two hundred of the examples of glass, terracotta oil lamps and some carved hardstones were purchased by Sir Hans Sloane and eventually found their way, with the rest of his collection, to establish the British Museum.Bolla d'oro (1736:35-46), noted by Fran√ßois de Polignac, \\"Francesco Bianchini et les 'cardinaux antiquaires'\\", in Valentin Kockel and Brigitte S√∂lch, eds., Francesco Bianchini (1662-1729) und die europ√§ische gelehrte Welt um 1700, 2005:171. Reasons of cost aborted the engraving of the watercolor drawings of the frescoes (now long disappeared) made for Ficoroni by Gaetano Piccini (1681‚Äì1736); the watercolors were purchased by Cardinal Gualterio but dispersed after his death in 1728.They have been traced to volumes from the Corsini and the Capponi collections, and at Eton, by Eliana Fileri, \\"Contributo allo studio dei disegni di pitture e mosaici antichi: il codice Corsini\\", Xenia Antiqua 9 (2000:79-146). The frescos in the 92 tombs unearthed along the via Appia were visited by the painter Carlo Maratta, who brought his students to view them.F. de Polignac, \\"Field, sites and finds: Images of archeological investigations and self-representations of antiquarians in early 18th century Rome\\", 2002 (on-line text, pdf file). Ficoroni's excavations at Hadrian's Villa were never fully published. Carlo Fea summarised some outstanding finds in 1790.Fea, Miscellanea filologica critica ed antiquaria dell'Avvocato Fea. Notizie di antichit√† ricavate dalle opere dell'Abate Francesco Ficoroni. (Rome, 1790, vol. II, 1827). The most famous object that was in his collection or passed through his hands was the fourth-century BCE cylindrical bronze ritual vessel known still as the \\"Ficoroni cista\\", which was found in an Etruscan woman's tomb just south of Palestrina (the ancient sanctuary site of Praeneste) in 1738 and which Ficoroni gallantly presented to the museum assembled by Athanasius Kircher in the Collegio Romano.The Ficoroni cista is now conserved in the Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia, Rome. It has four finials on its lid, the figure of Dionysus flanked by aroused satyrs, and love scenes of Heracles and Iolaos. The catalogue of his own collection of ancient Roman mercantile sealings stamped in lead was written by conte C. Gaetani and doubtless published at Ficoroni's expense.Piombi antichi mercantili...

The main purpose of the dam is hydroelectric power production and navigation. It is the first large-scale hydroelectric project in the Brazilian Amazon rainforest. The installed capacity of the 25-unit plant is . Phase I construction began in 1980 and ended in 1984 while Phase II began in 1998 and ended in 2010. The dam was featured in the 1985 film The Emerald Forest. Background and history The initial reconnaissance of the Tocantins River was carried out by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and USAID in 1964. The Amazon Energy Studies Coordination Committee was formed in 1968 and begin hydroelectric project studies in 1969. Before the committee closed, Eletrobr√°s commissioned further studies, called the \\"Tocantins Studies\\", on the entire Tocantins River Basin. In 1973, Brazilian President Em√≠lio M√©dici was asked to assign funding for a dam on the Tocantins. Two options were available: the Tucuru√≠ Dam and Santo Antonio Dam (unrelated to the current Santo Antonio Dam project on the Madeira river). In 1973, the Engevix-Ecotec consortium carried out feasibility studies and the Santo Antonio Dam was ruled out in 1974. Later in 1974, the Tucuru√≠ Dam was approved during the President Ernesto Geisel administration. The dam was built primarily as a source of hydroelectricity and second for navigation between the upper and lower Tocantins River. The electricity was and is primarily supplied to industrial interests from the aluminum industry like Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. Communities in Northeast Brazil would also benefit as well, such as Bel√©m, S√£o Luiz, Marab√°, and later Eastern Amazonia. The World Bank refused to fund the dam and most of the funding was procured by Eletronorte and Brazilian institutions such as Eletrobr√°s, BNH, Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal and FINAME. A smaller portion of funding came from Canadian, European and American institutions. In 1975, the consortium formed by the Brazilian companies Engevix and Themag were hired to draw up the basic and executive designs. In 1976, Camargo Correa won the bid to construct the dam. Construction=Phase I= Construction on Phase I began on November 24, 1975. Phase I called for the construction of the main dam, its dikes, the power house, spillway and upper portion of the navigation locks. On February 1, 1977, concrete-pouring began on site and in September 1978, the river diversion began. On September 6, 1984 the reservoir began filling and 206-days later it was at normal pool. Construction was completed 3 years behind schedule on November 10, 1984. The navigation lock that is part of the dam's design was only partially completed during Phase I with only the upper portion. The construction costs were predicted to be $3.6 billion but rose to over 5.5 billion by construction's end. Including interest during construction, the total cost for Phase I was $7.5 billion. Until 1999, Phase I produced an average of of electricity per year. =Phase II= Construction on the $1.35 billion Phase II began in June 1998. This phase called for the construction of the new power house for 11 x Francis turbines and the completion of the navigation lock-system. The new power house is located to the left of the old one and the locks are on the north side of the dam's abutments. Phase II was expected to be completed in 2006 but is behind schedule. The second power house was completed in April 2007 but construction on the navigation locks is behind schedule. Dam The main portion Tucuru√≠ Dam is a and concrete-gravity dam. The addition of the Moj√∫ and Caraip√© earth- fill dikes increases the total length to . The main dam's Creager-type service spillway is the second largest in the world with a maximum capacity of . It is controlled by 20 floodgates measuring . Reservoir The reservoir impounded by the dam has a capacity of with a live volume of . Power houses The Phase I power house is concrete and is fitted with an intake and penstocks. Phase I's power house contains 12 x Francis turbine generators. An auxiliary water intake and auxiliary powerhouse also houses 2 x generators. Locks The dam is designed to support two wide navigation locks.Eletrobras: UHE Tucuru√≠ Impact The Tucuru√≠ Dam brought power to 13 million people and 60% of the power is transferred to industries which create just under 2,000 jobs. Between 25,000 and 35,000 people were removed from the future reservoir zone in the early 1980s. 14,000 people were relocated by the government. 3,750 of these people moved to new islands created by the reservoir which lack adequate infrastructure. Construction of the dam attracted migrants which, along with the reservoir, significantly increased malaria and AIDS cases. The completion of Phase I in 1984 led to a large amount of unemployment among its 20,000 employees and subsequent migration from the area. The flooded area is in the Tocantins-Araguaia-Maranh√£o moist forests ecoregion, the most degraded in the Amazon region. The overall large influx of people to the area has led to deforestation and negative impacts from increased cattle-raising. The increases of population have also strained existing infrastructure or lack thereof.

The causes of the Franco-Prussian War are deeply rooted in the events surrounding German unification. In the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War (1866), Prussia had annexed numerous ethnically German territories and formed the North German Confederation with other German territories. Prussia then turned its attention towards the south of Germany, where it sought to expand its influence. France was strongly opposed to the annexation of the Southern German States (Bavaria, Wurttemberg, Baden and Hesse-Darmstadt) by the North German Confederation, which would have created too powerful a country next to its border. In Prussia, a war against France was deemed necessary to arouse German nationalism in those States in order to allow the unification of most German states (excluding the ethnically German lands of the Austrian Emire) into a great German empire. This aim was epitomized by Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismarck's quote: \\"I knew that a Franco-Prussian War must take place before a united Germany was formed.\\"Otto von Bismarck (A.J. Butler, trans.), Bismarck: The Man and the Statesman, vol. 2, page 58. Originally published in 1898; reprinted in 2007 by Cosimo Classics of New York, New York. Bismarck also knew that France should be the aggressor in the conflict to bring the Southern German States to side with Prussia, hence giving Germans numerical superiority.http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/216971/Franco-German-War The immediate cause of the war resided in the candidacy of a Prussian prince to the throne of Spain ‚Äì France feared encirclement by an alliance between Prussia and Spain. The Hohenzollern prince's candidacy was withdrawn under French diplomatic pressure, but Otto von Bismarck goaded the French into declaring war by altering a telegram sent by William I. Releasing the Ems Telegram to the public, Bismarck made it sound as if the king had treated the French envoy in a demeaning fashion. Six days later, France declared war on Prussia and Southern German States immediately sided with Prussia. French Emperor Napoleon III and Prime Minister √âmile Ollivier's eagerness to relieve France from internal political convulsions also contributed to France's declaration of war on Prussia. European wars and the balance of power: 1865‚Äì1866 In October 1865, Napoleon III, ruler of France, met with Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck in Biarritz, France. It was there that the two men struck a deal‚Äî France would not get involved in any future actions between Prussia and Austria or ally herself with Austria if Prussia somehow won the war and did not allow Italy to claim Venetia. When Austria and Prussia met in May 1866, Bismarck honored the agreement made in Biarritz the previous year and refused to allow Austria to have Venetia. Austria then attempted to guarantee Italy Venetia if they remained neutral, but the two nations were unable to agree on a suitable arrangement as an alliance formed earlier in the year bound Italy to Prussia. Napoleon III then committed a serious blunder by agreeing with Austria in a secret treaty to remain neutral in an Austrian- Prussian conflict in exchange for France acquiring Venetia plus the establishment of a neutral (i.e., French-leaning) state west of the Rhine; this violated the agreement Napoleon had made with Bismarck. Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Prussia After Prussia emerged victorious over the Austrian army at the Battle of K√∂niggr√§tz (also known as Sadowa or Sadov√°) in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, negotiations were being held between Austria and Prussia in July and August of that year. It was during that period that Napoleon III first discovered that a bladder stone was causing him great pains, created from gonorrheal infection. His condition was so bad during those negotiations that he was forced to retire to Vichy to recuperate, removing himself from Paris. Although the emperor favored neutrality as to not upset events, certain members of his circle thought it was an unwise move, considering the opportunity to prevent Prussia from becoming too strong. One of these men, foreign minister √âdouard Drouyn de Lhuys, convinced the emperor to plant 80,000 men on the eastern border to convince Wilhelm I to maintain the balance of power in Europe. Despite this important victory, de Lhuys was subverted by several other ministers, and Napoleon III changed his mind, reverting to a position of neutrality. This change of heart would end up causing de Lhuys to ultimately lose his position.Jerrold(1883). pp. 327‚Äì330 Napoleon III's wife Empress Eug√©nie, who took an active part throughout his rule, referred to this time much later as \\"the critical date, the Empire's fatal date; it was during these months of July and August that our fate was sealed! Of all that period, there is not a single fact, not a single detail that has not remained in my mind.\\"Bresler(1999). p. 340 Franz Joseph of Austria accepted Bismarck's terms under the Peace of Prague. Using this to his advantage, Bismarck declared the German Confederation of 1815 null and void, and created a new network of states under Prussian control. Frankfurt-am-Main, Hannover, Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), Holstein, Nassau, and Schleswig were annexed outright while Hesse-Darmstadt, Mecklenburg, Saxony, the Thuringian duchies, as well as the cities of Bremen, Hamburg, and L√ºbeck were combined into a new North German Confederation that governed nominally and was actually controlled by Prussia herself. Napoleon III, Emperor of the French Bismarck was approached soon after the end of the war by Napoleon III's ambassador to Prussia, Vincent Benedetti. Benedetti brought with him a secret proposal by Napoleon III that France would approve of Bismarck's acquisition of the northern German states and their control over the southern German states if Prussia remained neutral while France annexed Belgium and Luxembourg. France had earlier guaranteed the independence of Belgium in the Treaty of London in 1839 as an \\"independent and perpetually neutral state\\", making the proposal a tacit agreement to break their promise. Bismarck was very surprised since he had already gained a powerful position in Europe by the armistice, and called Napoleon III's request among others later \\"like 'an innkeeper's bill' or a waiter asking for 'a tip'.\\" He asked Benedetti to provide the proposal in writing, and the ambassador obliged his request. This document was to be important to Bismarck later on, to great effect.Bresler(1999). pp. 338‚Äì339 The true views of Napoleon III on the subject of the balance of power in Europe can be found in a state circular handed to every diplomatic representative for France. In this paper dated September 1, 1866, the emperor saw the future of Europe after the Peace of Prague in this manner: :\\"Policy should rise superior to the narrow and mean prejudices of a former age. The Emperor does not believe that the greatness of a country depends upon the weakness of the nations which surround it, and he sees a true equilibrium only in the satisfied aspirations of the nations of Europe. In this, he is faithful to old convictions and to the traditions of his race. Napoleon I foresaw the changes which are now taking place on the continent of Europe. He had sown the seeds of new nationalities: in the Peninsula, when he created the Kingdom of Italy; and in Germany, when he abolished two hundred and fifty three separate states.\\"Jerrold(1882) p. 332 Domestic agenda in France and Prussia=French prestige and politics= Jules Favre of the Second Republic in 1865 France's position in Europe was now in danger of being overshadowed by the emergence of a powerful Prussia, and France looked increasingly flat-footed following Bismarck's successes. In addition, French ruler Napoleon III was on increasingly shaky ground in domestic politics. Having successfully overthrown the Second Republic and established the Bonapartist Second Empire, Napoleon III was confronted with ever more virulent demands for democratic reform from leading republicans such as Jules Favre, along with constant rumours of impending revolution. In addition, French aspirations in Mexico had suffered a final defeat with the execution of the Austrian-born, French puppet Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico in 1867.Bresler(1999), p. 345 The French imperial government now looked to a diplomatic success to stifle demands for a return to either a republic or a Bourbon monarchy. A war with Prussia and resulting territorial gains in the Rhineland and later Luxembourg and Belgium seemed the best hope to unite the French nation behind the Bonapartist dynasty. With the resulting prestige from a successful war, Napoleon III could then safely suppress any lingering republican or revolutionary sentiment behind reactionary nationalism and return France to the center of European politics.Wawro(2003), p. 30 =Bismarck and German nationalism= Prussia in turn was also beset with problems. While revolutionary fervour was far more muted than in France, Prussia had in 1866 acquired millions of new citizens as a result of the Austro-Prussian War,Wawro(2003), p. 17 which was also a civil war among German states. The remaining German kingdoms and principalities maintained a steadfastly parochial attitude towards Prussia and German unification. The German princes insisted upon their independence and balked at any attempt to create a federal state that would be dominated by Berlin. Their suspicions were heightened by Prussia's quick victory and subsequent annexations.Taylor(1988), pp. 84-85. Before the war, only some Germans, inspired by the recent unification of Italy, accepted and supported what the princes began to realise, that Germany must unite in order to preserve the fruit of an eventual victory.Taylor(1988), pp. 70-71. Bismarck had an entirely different view after the war in 1866: he was interested only in strengthening Prussia through the eyes of a staunch realist. Uniting Germany appeared immaterial to him unless it improved Prussia's position.Taylor(1988), pp. 86-87. Bismarck had mentioned before the war the possibility of ceding territory along the Rhine to France, and Napoleon III, urged by his representatives in France, used these casual references by Bismarck to press for more of the territory that Prussia had received from Austria. These discussions, leaked by Bismarck to the German states in the south, turned former enemies into allies almost overnight, receiving not only written guarantees but armies that would be under the control of Prussia.Taylor(1988), pp. 88-89. Alliances and diplomacy=German states= Diplomatically and militarily, Napoleon III looked for support from Austria, Denmark, Bavaria, Baden, and W√ºrttemberg, as all had recently lost wars against Prussia. However, Napoleon III failed to secure revanchist alliances from these states. Denmark had twice fought Prussia during the First and Second Wars of Schleswig (a stalemate in the 1848‚Äì50, and a defeat in 1864 against a confederation of North German states and Austria under the leadership of Prussia), and was unwilling to confront Prussia again. As part of the settlement of the Austro- Prussian War in 1866, secret treaties of mutual defense were signed between Prussia and Bavaria, Baden, and W√ºrttemberg. What made them especially significant was that not only were they secret, giving Napoleon III a false sense of security, but Bismarck had used Napoleon III's earlier demand of territory along the Rhine to drive the southern German states into his arms. By these treaties, Prussia would defend all of the southern German states with its military power as long as their states joined the Northern Confederation in defense of Prussia. It was a bargain that would gravely threaten the French empereur and his designs on restoring French pride. =Austria and Italy= The Austrian Chancellor Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust was \\"impatient to take his revenge on Bismarck for Sadowa.\\" As a preliminary step, the Ausgleich with Hungary was \\"rapidly concluded.\\" Beust \\"persuaded Francis Joseph to accept Magyar demands which he had till then rejected.\\". However, Austria would not support France unless Italy was part of the alliance. Victor Emmanuel II and the Italian government wanted to support France, but Italian public opinion was bitterly opposed so long as Napoleon III kept a French garrison in Rome protecting Pope Pius IX, thereby denying Italy the possession of its capital (Rome had been declared capital of Italy in March 1861, when the first Italian Parliament had met in Turin). Napoleon III made various proposals for resolving the Roman Question, but Pius IX rejected them all. Despite his previous support for Italian unification, Napoleon did not wish to press the issue for fear of angering Catholics in France. Raffaele De Cesare, an Italian journalist, political scientist, and author, noted that: > :The alliance, proposed two years before 1870, between France, Italy, and > Austria, was never concluded because Napoleon III [...] would never consent > to the occupation of Rome by Italy. [...] He wished Austria to avenge > Sadowa, either by taking part in a military action, or by preventing South > Germany from making common cause with Prussia. [...] If he could insure, > through Austrian aid, the neutrality of the South German States in a war > against Prussia, he considered himself sure of defeating the Prussian army, > and thus would remain arbiter of the European situation. But when the war > suddenly broke out, before anything was concluded, the first unexpected > French defeats overthrew all previsions, and raised difficulties for Austria > and Italy which prevented them from making common cause with France. W√∂rth > and Sedan followed each other too closely. The Roman question was the stone > tied to Napoleon's feet ‚Äî that dragged him into the abyss. He never forgot, > even in August 1870, a month before Sedan, that he was a sovereign of a > Catholic country, that he had been made Emperor, and was supported by the > votes of the conservatives and the influence of the clergy; and that it was > his supreme duty not to abandon the Pontiff. [...] For twenty years Napoleon > III had been the true sovereign of Rome, where he had many friends and > relations [...] Without him the temporal power would never have been > reconstituted, nor, being reconstituted, would have endured. Another reason why Beust's desired revanche against Prussia did not materialize was the fact that, in 1870, the Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Andr√°ssy was \\"vigorously opposed.\\" =Russia= Tsar Alexander II of Russia In addition to the problems facing Napoleon III in obtaining potential allies, Bismarck worked feverishly to isolate France from the other European powers. Since 1863, Bismarck had made efforts to cultivate Russia, co-operating, amongst other things, in dealing with Polish insurgents. This important move gained for Bismarck the neutrality of Russia if Prussia went to war, and it also prevented Austria from taking sides with France as Austria fully supported the Poles. When Alexander II came to France on an official visit in 1867, he was at the receiving end of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by Polish-born Anton Berezovski while riding with Napoleon III and the Empress Eugenie. Tsar Alexander was very offended that not only the French courts had given Berezovski imprisonment instead of death but also the French press had sided with the Pole rather than Alexander. This experience forever shattered his views of France and saw in the reaction his visit had received why his father had despised the French. In 1868, he held discussions with the Prussians, intending to counter a possible Austrian alliance with Napoleon III by Franz Joseph. If German forces were, for any reason, bogged down in the west, then Prussia's eastern and southern flanks would have been highly vulnerable. With his usual skill, Bismarck moved carefully to sidestep the nightmare. The Russian government even went so far as to promise to send an army of 100,000 men against the Austrians if Austria joined France in a war against Prussia. Whilst at Ems in the crucial summer of 1870 Wilhelm I and Bismarck had meetings with Tsar Alexander, also present in the spa town Alexander, though not naturally pro-German, became very comfortable with Prussian suggestions. Bismarck also had talks at Ems with Alexander Gorchakov, the Russian Foreign Minister, and was assured in mid-July, days before the French declaration of war, that the agreement of 1868 still held: in the event of Austrian mobilisation, the Russians confirmed that they would send 300,000 troops into Galicia. Bismarck now had all he wanted: a counter to Austria and the assurance of a one-front war. =United Kingdom= Bismarck then made Benedetti's earlier draft public to The Times in London that demanded Belgium and Luxembourg as the price for remaining neutral during the Austro-Prussian War. Sensitive to the threat of a major power controlling the strategically significant Low Countries and the English Channel coastline, the United Kingdom government in particular took a decidedly cool attitude to these French demands, and the British people were disturbed by this subversive attempt at going back on Napoleon III's word. Therefore, Britain as a nation did nothing to aid France. The Prime Minister, William Gladstone, expressed his thoughts on the matter to Queen Victoria by writing to her that \\"Your majesty will, in common with the world, have been shocked and startled.\\"Bresler(1999), pp. 338-339. Though it had enjoyed some time as the leading power of continental Europe, the French Empire found itself dangerously isolated. Monarchial crises=Luxembourg crisis= Map showing the location of Luxembourg within modern Europe The king of the Netherlands, William III, was under a personal union with Luxembourg that guaranteed its sovereignty. Napoleon III had taken note that the king had amassed certain personal debts that would make a sale of Luxembourg to France possible. However, Luxembourg lies astride one of the principal invasion routes an army would use to invade either France or Germany from the other. The city of Luxembourg's fortifications were considered \\"the Gibraltar of the North\\" and neither side could tolerate the other controlling such a strategic location. The pressure on Bismarck to object not only came from his monarch William I, but from Chief of Staff of the Prussian army Helmuth von Moltke. Moltke had additional reason to object: he desired war with France, stating flatly, \\"Nothing could be more welcome to us than to have now the war that we must have.\\"Taylor(1988) pp. 104-105 Bismarck balked at such talk about war. He refused to actually engage France on the basis that he firmly believed that Prussia would gain a far more decisive advantage by merely opposing the sale and that Napoleon III could be thwarted due to his fear of war with Prussia.Taylor(1988) pp. 107-108 Assuming that Bismarck would not object, the French government was shocked to learn that instead Bismarck, Prussia and the North German Confederation were threatening war should the sale be completed. Napoleon III had let precious months peel away in trying to complete the transaction, allowing Bismarck time to rally support to Prussia's objection.Wawro(2003) pp. 22-23. To mediate the dispute, the United Kingdom hosted the London Conference (1867) attended by all European great powers. It confirmed Luxembourg's independence from the Netherlands and guaranteed its independence from all other powers. War appeared to have been averted, at the cost of thwarting French desires.Taylor(1988) p. 106 =Spanish throne= The Spanish throne had been vacant since the revolution of September 1868, and the Spanish offered the throne to the German prince Leopold of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen, a Catholic as well as a distant cousin of King Wilhelm of Prussia. Leopold and Wilhelm I were both uninterested, but the wily Bismarck was acutely interested, as it was an opportunity to once again best Napoleon III. Bismarck persuaded Leopold's father to accept the offer for his nation, and it was accepted instead by Leopold himself in June 1870.Wawro(2003), p. 34. =The Hohenzollern crisis and the Ems Dispatch= Wilhelm I of Germany at his desk On 2 July 1870, \\"Marshall Prim [who held power in Spain] announced in Madrid that the Spanish government had offered the crown of Spain to Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern.\\" Ridley (1980) p. 558 Fearing that a Hohenzollern king in Prussia and another one in Spain would put France into a two-front situation, France this time was determined to stand up to the expansion of Prussian influence. Napoleon III at this time was suffering the most unbearable pain from his stones,Bresler(1999), pp. 357-358. and the Empress Eug√©nie was essentially charged with countering the designs of Prussia. She had a vital interest in the crisis as she was of Spanish blood and a member of the royal line. The secretary of foreign affairs, Duc Antoine de Gramont, was directed by the Empress to be the principal instrument by which France would press for war should Leopold ascend the throne. Gramont delivered a speech in front of the Chambre l√©gislative, proclaiming that \\"We shall know how to fulfill our duty without hesitation and without weakness.\\" The fatal mistake would soon come as a result of Gramont's inexperience, for he counted on alliances that only existed in his mind.Wawro(2003), pp. 35-36. > The French press immediately protested the prospect of a Hohenzollern on the > Spanish throne, and on 6 July the new Foreign Minister, the Duc de Gramont > [...] told the Chamber that France would not permit Prince Leopold to become > King of Spain. [The French Premier Emile] Ollivier added that he had no > doubt that Prussia would yield in the face of French firmness, but that 'if > war be necessary, the government will not enter upon it without the consent > of the Legislative Body.' Gramont's statement and Ollivier's mention of war > were greeted with great enthusiasm by the deputies, and in the public > galleries the ladies rose to their feet and waved their handkerchiefs as > they joined in the wild applause. Next day the Paris press called for war > with Prussia, and on 8 July their language was even more violent. The > government instructed [Comte Vincente] Benedetti, the French ambassador to > Prussia, to demand that King William should publicly refuse his consent to > Prince Leopold's acceptance of the throne of Spain. > On 11 July, Benedetti spoke to King William at the watering spa at Ems, and > asked him to refuse his consent to Prince Leopold's candidature; Bismarck > was on holiday at his estates in East Prussia. King William agreed to order > Prince Leopold to withdraw. Ollivier announced the Prussian surrender in the > Chamber on 12 July and hailed it as a French triumph and a Prussian > humiliation. Bismarck thought the same and considered resigning as Prime > Minister. Gramont and Ollivier did not conceal their regret that the > Prussians had given in; and the deputies and most of the press were > disappointed that that there was to be no war. [...] Louis Napoleon sensed > the public regret that there would be no war. 'The country will be > disappointed,' he cabled to Ollivier on 12 July; 'but what can we do?' He > was in complete agreement with the decision which was taken by the Cabinet > on the same day to ask for further guarantees from Prussia and to require > King William to give an undertaking that he would never in the future allow > Prince Leopold to accept the crown of Spain. When Benedetti confronted King > William on the promenade at Ems on the afternoon of 13 July and asked him to > give this undertaking, the King was annoyed, refused to do so, and walked > away a little abruptly.Ridley (1980) p. 561 Following this direct confrontation, which had bypassed diplomatic protocols, King Wilhelm then sent a message to Berlin reporting this event with the French ambassador, and Bismarck shrewdly edited it to make it \\"like a red tag to the bull\\" for the French government.Bresler(1999), p. 363 The dispatch was edited as follows (with the words sent in bold): Memorial stone to the Ems Dispatch in Bad Ems Count Benedetti spoke to me on the promenade, in order to demand from me, finally in a very importunate manner, that I should authorize him to telegraph at once that I bound myself for all future time never again to give my consent if the Hohenzollerns should renew their candidature. I refused at last somewhat sternly, as it is neither right nor possible to undertake engagements of this kind √† tout jamais. Naturally I told him that I had as yet received no news, and as he was earlier informed about Paris and Madrid than myself, he could clearly see that my government once more had no hand in the matter. His Majesty has since received a letter from the Prince. His Majesty having told Count Benedetti that he was awaiting news from the Prince, has decided with reference to the above demand, upon the representation of Count Eulenburg and myself, not to receive Count Benedetti again, but only to let him be informed through an aide-de-camp that his Majesty had now received from the Prince confirmation of the news which Benedetti had already received from Paris, and had nothing further to say to the ambassador. His Majesty leaves it to your Excellency whether Benedetti's fresh demand and its rejection should not be at once communicated both to our ambassadors and to the press.Bresler(1999), pp. 363-364. This dispatch made the encounter more heated than it really was. Known as the Ems Dispatch, it was released to the press. It was designed to give the French the impression that King Wilhelm I had insulted the French Count Benedetti, and to give the Prussian people the impression that the Count had insulted the King. It succeeded in both of its aims- Gramont called it \\"a blow in the face of France\\", and the members of the French legislative body spoke of taking \\"immediate steps to safeguard the interests, the security, and the honor of France.\\"Bresler(1999), pp. 364-365. On 19 July 1870 \\"Le Sourd, the French Charg√© d'Affaires, delivered Napoleon's declaration of war at the Foreign Office\\" in Berlin.Moritz Busch, Bismarck: Some secret pages from his history, Macmillan, New York (1898) Vol. I, p. 37 According to the secret treaties signed with Prussia and in response to popular opinion, Bavaria, Baden, and W√ºrttemberg mobilised their armies and joined the war against France.Howard(1991), p. 60. =European public reaction= At the outbreak of the war, European public opinion heavily favored the Germans. For example, many Italians attempted to sign up as volunteers at the Prussian embassy in Florence, and a Prussian diplomat visited Giuseppe Garibaldi in Caprera. After the fall of Napoleon III following the Battle of Sedan, Bismarck's demand for the return of Alsace caused a dramatic shift in that sentiment, which was best exemplified by the reaction of Garibaldi soon after the revolution in Paris, who told the Movimento of Genoa on 7 September 1870, \\"Yesterday I said to you: war to the death to Bonaparte. Today I say to you: rescue the French Republic by every means.\\" See also *French‚ÄìGerman enmity NotesReferences      * External links *http://petitsamisdelacommune.chez-alice.fr/ *Postcards from the Franco-German War 1870/71 *Texts and documents about German-French relations and an essay on the Franco-German war Category:Franco-Prussian War Franco-Prussian War, Causes of the ","title":"Causes of the Franco-Prussian War"},{"id":"15085739","text":"John \\"Johnny\\" Alan Wright (19 May 1929 - 12 July 2001) was a British amateur boxer who won a silver medal in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London.

Biography Crooks was born in 1947 and raised by his grandmother and three uncles from the age of 4 after his mother emigrated to England in 1952 (his father emigrated to the United States before he was born).Katz, David (2000), People Funny Boy - The Genius of Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, Payback Press, He was beaten by his uncles and teachers. He also had a stammer but began singing as a teenager, inspired by James Brown and Otis Redding, whom he heard on American radio stations. His first group was the Two Tones, formed with friends Brenton Matthews and Fathead, who recorded unsuccessfully for Duke Reid. Barker had a brief stint in Winston Riley's Techniques, singing alongside Riley and Bruce Ruffin, and formed a duo with Glen Brown in the duo Glen and Dave, recording for both Harry J and Coxsone Dodd, while also working in the pressing plant at Studio One. Brown introduced Crooks to Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, suggesting that Perry get Crooks to voice a track at a recording session. The resulting track was \\"Prisoner of Love\\", and led to Crooks becoming a regular vocalist for Perry, who decided Crooks should record as Dave Barker, and encouraged American-style deejay vocals in addition to Barker's usual high tenor singing. Barker had hit singles with \\"Shocks of a Mighty\\" and \\"Spinning Wheel\\" (with Melanie Jonas), followed in 1970 by his debut album Prisoner of Love. Working with Perry at the same time as The Wailers, Barker toasted over the latter's \\"Small Axe\\" for 1971's \\"Shocks 71\\". March 1971 brought international fame as part of a duo with Ansell Collins. \\"Double Barrel\\" was a number 1 hit in the United Kingdom, and was also the first recording on which drummer Sly Dunbar played. \\"Double Barrel\\" was followed in June of the same year with a number 7 UK hit in the form of \\"Monkey Spanner\\". The duo failed to sustain success in the UK, and Collins returned to Jamaica, with Barker settling in England and embarking once again on a solo career, releasing 1976's In The Ghetto, which while credited to Dave and Ansell Collins, was a solo effort. He then joined vocal group Chain Reaction along with Bruce Ruffin and Bobby Davis, targeting the soul market, but without great success. Barker has continued to record, including a live album featuring Barker playing with The Selecter. In 2005 Dave Barker performed a couple of tracks with UK ska/ reggae band The Riffs The Riffs at Club Ska in London. A version of Double Barrel (recorded with The Riffs) was released on The Riffs - Live at Club Ska album the following year on Moon Ska Records. He appeared as a guest on The Radcliffe & Maconie BBC Radio 6 Music show on 20 August 2012 talking extensively about the music he was influenced by and the music had created alongside Ansell and about Jamaica's independence.

After an epic combat performance in the Battle of Stalingrad, the 62nd Army was granted Guards status and renamed the 8th Guards Army in April 1943. History 62nd Army command post in December 1942 The 7th Reserve Army was formed 28 May 1942 as part of the Stavka Reserve (RVGK). Within one month, this force had been redesignated the 62nd Army. From mid August 1942 until late January 1943, the 62nd Army, under the command of General Vasily Chuikov, fought in the Battle of Stalingrad. 62nd Army conducted an epic defense of the city against repeated and desperate attacks by the German 6th Army. The Army, along with the 64th Army, was operating under the Soviet Stalingrad Front. After the German assault at Stalingrad had come to utter disaster, the 62nd Army was uniquely awarded the Order of Lenin, and granted Guards status as the 8th Guards Army.

His prints helped to popularise the works of painters like John Phillip and Sir John Everett Millais. Biography Barlow was born in Oldham in Lancashire, the son of Henry Barlow, an ironmonger living in the High Street, and Sarah (n√©e) Oldham. He was educated at the Old Grammar School, Oldham, and was then articled to \\"Stephenson & Royston\\", a firm of engravers in Manchester. He studied at the Manchester School of Design, where he won a prize of 10 guineas in 1846 for a drawing entitled 'Cullings from Nature'. Portrait of Richard Quain (engraving after Daniel Maclise) He moved to Ebury Street, London, in 1847. His first independent work was a line engraving of John Phillip's 'Courtship', made in 1848, and this led to a close friendship with the painter, the most important of whose pictures he subsequently engraved. These include 'Dona Pepita' (1858); 'The Prison Window' (1860); 'The House of Commons in 1860' (1866); 'Prayer in Spain' (1873); 'Highland Breakfast' (1877); and the celebrated 'La Gloria' (1877). Barlow was the executor of Phillip's will, and drew up a catalogue of the collection of the artist's works which were shown at the Third Annual International Exhibition in London in 1873. In 1856, Barlow engraved John Everett Millais's 'Huguenot', and in 1860 his 'My First Sermon', and during the latter part of his life was largely engaged upon that artist's works. Portraits of John Bright, Sir William Sterndale Bennett, Gladstone, Tennyson, Cardinal Newman, Lord Salisbury, and other public characters, painted by Millais for the art dealer \\"Agnew's\\", were all engraved by Barlow. Other well-known engravings include the 'Death of Chatterton' (after Henry Wallis); portrait of Sir Isaac Newton (after Godfrey Kneller); portrait of Charles Dickens (after William Powell Frith); and several after Landseer, Maclise, Ansdell, and James Sant. Barlow engraved Turner's 'Wreck of the Minotaur' for the Earl of Yarborough, who presented the plate to the Artists' General Benevolent Institution, and in 1856, for the same charity, he made a large etching of Turner's 'Vintage of Macon'. Thirty years later he repeated the work in mezzotint, shortly before his death. In 1858 Barlow founded the \\"Kensington Life Academy\\",Leighton and the ‚ÄòKensington Life Academy‚Äô (\\"Lord Leighton's drawings). an informal life- drawing club attended by a small but select group of artists, and which met at the studios of Richard Ansdell (hence the alternative name \\"Ansdell's\\"). Barlow was elected an associate engraver of the Royal Academy in 1873, a full associate in 1876, and an academician (RA) in 1881. He was a member and, for many years, secretary of The Etching Club. Barlow died at his house, Auburn Lodge, in Victoria Road, Kensington, on 24 December 1889, and was buried in Brompton cemetery. Family In 1851, he had married Ellen Cocks, daughter of James Cocks of Oldham, who survived him. They had 2 surviving daughters. Portraits of Barlow were painted by John Phillip in 1856, and by Millais in 1886, and he sat as a model for the figure of the sick ornithologist in the Millais's picture, 'The Ruling Passion'.

In Burns' finest season for the Browns, 1932, he scored 111 runs, batted .305, hit 11 homers and drove home 70 runs batted in (RBIs). Over his big league career (1930‚Äì36), he appeared in 890 games, and batted .280 with 980 hits, 44 homers and 417 RBIs. His career fielding percentage was .992. He led American League first basemen in assists in 1931 and 1932. Coaching and scouting career Burns became a manager in the minor leagues with the 1938 Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League, replacing Dan Howley on June 27 with the Leafs in eighth place. He rallied the team to a fifth place standing that year, but when Toronto finished last in 1939, Burns was released. After World War II, he joined the Boston Red Sox farm system, managing their Eastern League affiliates in Scranton and Albany from 1949 to 1954. His 1952 Albany Senators won the league pennant, while his 1954 Senators were the EL playoff champions. Burns then spent five seasons (1955‚Äì59) as a Red Sox coach, working primarily as the third-base coach under manager Pinky Higgins. He scouted for Boston from 1960 until his death, at Brighton, Massachusetts, at the age of 67. As a New England-based Red Sox scout, he is credited with recommending and signing Baseball Hall of Fame catcher Carlton Fisk, a first-round selection in the January 1967 draft. Personal His son Bob Burns was a baseball coach at Kennett High School, North Conway, New Hampshire, from 1971‚Äì2012. Each year, the school presents the Jack Burns Baseball Award.

Course of the engagement Monument to Poles killed during the fighting on 2 August 1944 After heavy fighting on the first day of the Warsaw Uprising, during the evening of 1‚Äì2 August 1944, the majority of military units of the 4th Ochota Sub-district, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Mieczys≈Çaw Soko≈Çowski (pseudonym Grzyma≈Ça) began to withdraw from Ochota in the direction of Sƒôkocin and Chojnowo forests. At 5 a.m on 2 August, the concentrated units set off from the region of Regu≈Çy village via Pƒôcice in the direction of the forests. German military units were stationed in the manor-house of Pƒôcice. The distance from Regu≈Çy to Pƒôcice amounted to about 2 km. The terrain was unfavourable from an operational point of view for the insurgents, as the march required them to advance along 1 km of road up a slope to Pƒôcice, followed by a 1 km section of the way leading on a dike along a broad, occasionally wet meadow. The German defenders possessed good observation and fields of fire which gave them an advantage over the approaching Polish units. As the Polish units advanced along the dike, cars appeared with German troops. A fight ensued, the sounds of which alarmed the German units stationed in the Pƒôcice manor-house. The well-placed and well-ranged German units struck the column of insurgent units with well-aimed machine-gun fire. The column of insurgent units divided itself in two parts: the advance party including three scout platoons attacking along the road and engaging the main German force, and the main element of the insurgent force, which, under cover of that attack, by-passed Pƒôcice from the right side and reached the Sƒôkociny forests and then the Chojnowo forests. The units attacking Pƒôcice directly suffered heavy losses with many casualties and prisoners. On 2 August, the Germans executed sixty of the insurgents who had been captured in the brick-yard in Pƒôcice.

Bush (Civil Action No. 05-cv-01509) is a petition for habeas corpus filed on behalf of Jamal Kiyemba, a Ugandan citizen formerly held in extrajudicial detention in the United States' Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba. Mr. Kiyemba is the next friend of each of the nine Uighur petitioners, Abdusabur, Abdusamad, Abdunasir, Hammad, Hudhaifa, Jalaal, Khalid, Saabir, and Saadiq, who seek the writ of habeas corpus through the petition Sabin Willett, Susan Baker Manning and a team of Bingham McCutchen lawyers are counsel for his petition, and those of nine other men whose petitions were attached to his. Kiyemba was released in 2006; and all Uyghur detainees at Guantanamo Bay had been released by 2013. Military Commissions Act The Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed. Boumediene v. Bush On June 12, 2008 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated. Re-initiation On July 18, 2008 George M. Clarke III filed a \\"Uighur petitioners' status report\\" on behalf of the seventeen Uyghur captives in Guantanamo. In the status report Clarke named seven Uyghur captives whose habeas petitions were amalgamated with Kiyemba v. Bush. Their names were: Abdul Nasser, Abdul Sabour, Abdul Semet, Hammad Memet, Huzaifa Parhat, Jalal Jalaldin, Khalid Ali and Sabir Osman. On 2008-07-22 Susan Baker Manning filed a \\"Huzaifa Parhat's motion for judgment on his habeas petition ordering release into the continental United States\\" in Civil Action No. 05-cv-1509 (RMU). On 2008-07-23 Manning filed a \\"NOTICE OF FILING\\" on behalf of Abdusabur Doe (ISN 275). On 2008-07-25 Manning filed a \\"Huzaifa Parhat's motion for immediate release on parole into the continental United States pending final judgment on his habeas petition\\". On 2008-08-15 Manning filed a \\"REPLY OF HUZAIFA PARHAT TO GOVERNMENT'S OPPOSITION TO MOTIONS FOR PAROLE AND JUDGMENT ORDERING RELEASE\\". On 2008-10-01 Manning filed a \\"PETITIONERS' SUPPLEMENTAL MEMORANDUM IN RESPONSE TO GOVERNMENT'S NOTICE OF STATUS\\". On 2008-10-07 Manning filed a \\"PETITIONERS' PROFFER REGARDING AVAILABLE SERVICES AND SUPPORT FOR RESETTLEMENT IN THE UNITED STATES\\". On 2008-10-07 Manning filed a \\"[Proposed] order\\". On 2008-10-22 Manning filed a \\"Emergency motion for order related to counsel visit of October 27, 2008\\". Appeal After the men were ordered to be released by the US District Court the Department of Justice appealed that ruling to a panel of court of appeals. The Court of Appeals ruled that the courts lacked the authority to force men held in Guantanamo to be released on US territory. Kiyemba v. Obama, also known as Kiyemba I One of the unresolved issues raised by the re-initiation of the Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions is whether Federal civilian judges have the authority to order the Executive Branch to set captives free in the United States. The United States Supreme Court has considered making a ruling in the case of the Kiyemba petitioners, over whether the Judicial Branch has that authority. In 2009 the State Department was able to get Bermuda to offer residency to four of the Uyghur captives. A delegation from the small Pacific Ocean State of Palau visited the Uyghurs in Guantanamo, and eventually offered residency to all but one of the Uyghur captives. The one Uyghur captive for whom Palau decline to offer residence was Arkin Mahmud, who had travelled to Afghanistan to look for his younger brother, Bahtiyar Mahnut, who their family was concerned had disappeared into Afghanistan. He was one of the eldest Uyghurs, and, he became seriously mentally ill in Guantanamo‚Äîill-enough that Palau did not feel did not have the mental health support infrastructure to heal him. His younger brother felt that he could not abandon the brother who had only travelled to Afghanistan to try to rescue him. In February Switzerland accepted the two brothers, leaving only five Uyghurs in Guantanamo. Since the other five remaining Uyghurs have been offered residency in Palau some legal scholars have speculated that the Supreme Court will decline to rule on the Kiyemba habeas, because they have the option of moving to Palau. Kiyemba II Kiyemba II is the name for habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of ten Guantanamo captives, who fear being repatriated to their country of citizenship. In April 2009 a three judge panel of DC Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling of District Court Judges, stating that they had no authority to rule whether the executive branch could send captives back to their home countries, when they feared torture or other abuse there. On September 10, 2010, the entire court sat to review the case, en banc. Their decision was split six to five, confirming their colleagues ruling. However the five dissenters wrote a long opinion, and commentators have speculated that the case will be heard before the Supreme Court.

Life Eva Marie Veigel was born in Vienna. She was a well known dancer of her day, using the stage name Violette or Violetti, said to be a nickname given to her by Empress Maria Theresa based on the meaning of her surname‚Äîa corruption from the Middle High German viol, \\"violet.\\" As Chester says, \\"Nothing appears to be absolutely known concerning her origin.\\" There is some doubt as to her paternity, with some saying she was the daughter of a respectable Viennese businessman named John Veigel; but Veigel and her husband were known to say she was of noble paternity. Guido Wald R√ºdiger, Count of Starhemberg and Richard Boyle, the Earl of Burlington are thought the most likely candidates if this claim is true. She had a brother, Ferdinand Charles, who was also a ballet dancer. One French biography of her life claimed she was known to be one of the most beautiful women in all of Europe. She emigrated to London in 1746, speaking little English. It is rumored that the Empress sent her there as a banishment, after noticing the Emperor taking too great a fancy to her for her beauty, though this story is often thought unlikely. Marriage Eva Marie Veigel and husband David Garrick, painted by William Hogarth. The painting is in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle. Veigel married David Garrick on 22 June 1749. As she was a Catholic and he a Protestant, the couple went through two marriage ceremonies. According to Bailey, Veigel first fell in love with Garrick after seeing him perform on the stage, and their respective entertainment careers caused them to meet socially soon thereafter. He was taken with her just as quickly, but her wealthy patron, Dorothy Boyle, the Countess of Burlington (wife of the 3rd Earl of Burlington), discouraged her from marrying him as Veigel had performed in the royal courts of Europe and Garrick was seen as being a match much beneath her. Reportedly the Countess asked Garrick to use his performance abilities to make Veigel fall out of love with him, which he did attempt. The scheme did not work, but Burlington was nevertheless impressed enough with the effort that she changed her opinion on Garrick and decided Veigel would be well to marry him. This reported incident may have been the inspiration for such plays as Robertson's David Garrick. By all accounts the match between Garrick and Veigel was a happy one. They were childless, and Veigel outlived her husband by forty-three years. On marrying, she retired from dancing. Garrick's increasing wealth enabled him purchase a palatial estate for Eva Marie and himself to live in, naming it Garrick's Villa, that he bought at Hampton in 1754. At the time of her death she was living at Adelphi Terrace, in London's borough of Westminster. Her will, dated 28 January 1819, with codicils of 28 November 1821 and 15 August 1822, was proved on 30 October 1822. The only relations of her own whom she named were her niece Elizabeth, wife of Mr. Peter de Saar, of Vienna, and her god-daughter Eva-Maria de Saar, daughter of her late nephew Louis de Saar, of Oldenburgh, in Hungary. She reportedly lived to 99 years of age, though her stated birthdate of leap-year's day would make her 98 at the time of her death. She was buried in Westminster Abbey with her husband.

The film co-stars Bernhard Minetti, and is Riefenstahl's last feature film as both director and lead actress. Riefenstahl started to develop the script in 1934, with the movie being shot between 1940 and 1944. However, it was not completed by the end of World War II and was eventually finalized and released on February 11, 1954. It was listed as the feature film with the longest production time in history by the Guinness Book of World Records., cited by Despite this record being surpassed by The Thief and the Cobbler (with 29 years of production from 1964 to 1993), Tiefland still stands as the live action film with the longest production time. Riefenstahl's movie is the second Tiefland film that is based on the opera, the first one being a silent film in 1922, directed by Adolf E. Licho, with Lil Dagover as the main actress. The earlier American silent movie Marta of the Lowlands (1914) was based on the English translation of a Spanish translation of Guimer√†'s play. Plot summary Pedro, a shepherd, is sleeping in his Pyrenean mountain hut when his herd is attacked by a lone wolf. He awakens to defend his sheep, and manages to strangle the wolf. Meanwhile, in the Catalan lowlands of northeastern Spain, a canal is completed which diverts water from the farms and fields of the peasants to support the prize bulls of the landowner, Don Sebastian, marquis of Roccabruno. He arrogantly rejects the request of the peasants for water. However, he has significant debts and needs money. The rich Amelia plans to marry him, but he offends her. Martha, a \\"beggar dancer\\", comes to the village and entertains the people. Sebastian sees her and takes her to his castle, enchanted by her beauty and grace. He keeps her as his mistress in a \\"golden cage\\". Martha pleads with him to listen to the plight of the peasants, but he rejects their request again. Seeing his arrogance and inhumanity, she runs away. She collapses in exhaustion in the mountains where Pedro finds her and takes her to his hut. Sebastian's men locate her and return her to the castle. Sebastian, in dire need to settle his finances, conjures a plan. He will marry Amelia but keep Martha as a mistress; he wants her married to somebody he can manipulate and control. Pedro is commanded to marry her and is installed in a mill under Sebastian's control. For this, Martha despises Pedro at first; but once she realizes that he married her out of love, she responds. Sebastian arrives to be with his mistress. A fight ensues, and Pedro strangles him as he had done to the wolf. In the final scene, Pedro and Martha walk up to the mountains. Production Riefenstahl began working on the script in 1934, but shelved it when she became more involved with Nazi propaganda films. After the beginning of World War II, and disturbed by atrocities she witnessed, she had herself dispensed from shooting war documentaries. Using her influence as Hitler's favorite film maker she managed her own production company, Riefenstahl Film, GmbH, independently of the control of Joseph Goebbels who oversaw cultural and propaganda activities. Financed by Hitler with money from the Nazi party and the government, she remained outside of Goebbels' control. Goebbels eventually was not happy about it as the project ran into difficulties and cost overruns. Resuming her work on Tiefland, Riefenstahl started filming in Spain in 1940, but forced by war events soon shifted her work to the Alps, in Germany in the Karwendel and in Italy in the Rosengarten of the Dolomites, as well as the Babelsberg Studios in Berlin. Near Mittenwald, the Spanish village of Roccabruno was reconstructed. Although the German press anticipated the release of the movie in 1941, the production proved to be much more difficult and costly and outdoor shooting lasted until 1944. In 1941, Goebbels had complained about the \\"waste of money\\", and one year later called it a \\"rat's nest of entanglements\\". Problems were compounded by Riefenstahl's depression and other ailments, poor weather, accidents, and the difficulty of getting actors and staff organized during the war. Eventually, at a cost of about 8.5 million Reichsmark, Tiefland was the most expensive black-and-white movie produced in Nazi Germany. After the bombing of the Babelsberg studios in Berlin, the Barrandov Studios in Prague were used to further the work, and by the time the war came to the end, Riefenstahl was in the editing and synchronization process at Kitzb√ºhl. Riefenstahl took the female lead role of Martha, a step that was not originally planned; however, she found no actress to her liking available at the time, and so she did it.Luc Deneulin. Essay. DVD version (2006) of Tiefland. Also accessible here Her last major role had been a decade before. She may have been attracted to play a dancer, as dancing was her original artistic calling. She later regretted the decision, as she looked much too old by her own account. \\"When I saw myself on the screen, I was embarrassed. There was no doubt about it, I was miscast.\\" Critics seemed to agree: she was over forty, while her lover was played by the 23-year-old Franz Eichberger. Bernhard Minetti played Sebastian. Arnold Fanck, Veit Harlan and Georg Wilhelm Pabst all gave directorial assistance at one time or the other. Harald Reinl, who co-wrote the script, choreographed her dancing scene. Herbert Windt and Giuseppe Becce worked on the musical score that was inspired by Eugen d'Albert's opera. The camera work delivered later well-received nature shots of the Karwendel and Dolomite mountains. The wrestling scene of Eichberger with the only half-tamed wolf was supervised by Bernhard Grzimek. After the war, the film was confiscated and kept by French authorities for several years, but eventually returned to her. Four reels of film were missing when Riefenstahl received the film, notably the scenes shot in Spain. Despite efforts she failed to retrieve the missing footage. After its final editing, the movie was released in 1954. Riefenstahl deposited a quantity of unused Tiefland material with the Bundesarchiv, the German national archives. Release The film secured distribution agreements for Germany, Austria and the United States in 1954. The world premiere was held on 11 February 1954 in Stuttgart. Riefenstahl embarked on a personal appearances tour of Austria in support of the film. She described the tour as \\"a roaring success\\". The film was also screened at several film festivals. This included the 1954 Cannes Film Festival where it was screened in the 'out of competition' category. In 1981, the movie was released in the United States with a limited run.Tiefland (1954) Janet Maslin: Tiefland (1954) - \\"Tifeland\\", with Leni Riefenstahl as Star and Director. Published: October 7, 1981, New York Times When Riefenstahl was ninety, she negotiated the VHS release as part of the Leni Riefenstahl Collection. The 2006 DVD version has an essay by Luc Deneulin on the background to the movie. Reception The film was released to a mixed reception. Riefenstahl regarded the response as \\"objective\\". Some critics decided that the style and topic of the movie appeared dated and out of touch, and the burden of her name made it unwelcome. Most ignored her acting, although this was recognised by those that commented as a weak performance. Almost all reviewers acknowledged photographic effects of unusual beauty and praised her direction. Jean Cocteau, then chairman of the 1954 Cannes Film Festival, was struck by its \\"Breughel-like intensity\\" and \\"the poetry of the camera\\". He offered to provide French subtitles himself and attempted to persuade the West German government to make the film its official entry. On the 1981 American re-release, The New York Times reviewed the film, deciding that the village scenes could have been more successful but heaping praise on the mountain footage: The revisionist view of the 1990s has suggested that the film is a criticism of Nazism. Historians have claimed that the film's true value is as a psychobiography, stressing the film as a political allegory rather than melodrama. Sebastian represents a totalitarian government that tramples the rights and needs of the people, and Pedro is a hero who is \\"naive\\" and apolitical, only doing what he thinks is right. Even the wolf could be construed as an allegory for Hitler. Riefenstahl insisted that none of her movies had any political messages, and only conceded that this movie was her \\"inner emigration\\". Other interpretations saw the marquis as a representation of a Hitler figure, Martha as a stand-in for a repentant Leni, an unfortunate tempted by opportunism. Controversy In 1940, shooting of the movie was moved from Spain to Germany and Italy. In the Dolomites, people from the Sarntal were recruited as (paid) extras. However, for extras with a specific \\"Spanish look\\", Riefenstahl picked children and adults of Roma and Sinti background who were held in Nazi collection camps, so-called \\"Zigeunerlager\\". Fifty-one Roma and Sinti prisoners were chosen from the Maxglan-Leopoldskron camp (near Salzburg) for filming in the Alps in 1940, and, in 1942, at least 66 Roma and Sinti prisoners were taken from the Marzahn camp for scenes at Babelsberg.No Roma! Venice Film Festival These extras are seen, for instance, in the dancing sequence in the tavern, and Sinti children run alongside Pedro when he comes down from the mountain to marry Martha. In three denazification trials after the war, Riefenstahl was accused of Nazi collaboration and eventually termed a \\"fellow traveler\\"; however, none of the Sinti was asked to testify. The issue surfaced after the German magazine Revue published the use of these extras in 1949 and indicated that they were forced labor and sent later to Auschwitz where many of them perished in the Holocaust. While some of the surviving Sinti claimed that they were mistreated, others dissented. Riefenstahl claimed that she treated these extras well, and that she was not aware that they were going to be sent to Auschwitz. At one point she even insisted that, after the war, she had seen \\"all the gypsies\\" who had worked on the film. In 1982, Nina Gladitz produced a documentary Zeit des Schweigens und der Dunkelheit (Time of Darkness and Silence) and examined the use of these Sinti in the making of Tiefland. Riefenstahl subsequently sued Gladitz for defamation and while it was shown that she visited camps and selected Sinti for extras, Gladitz' claim that Riefenstahl knew that they would be sent to Auschwitz had to be stricken from the documentary. Gladitz, however, refused to do so, and thus her film has not been shown since. The issue surfaced again in 2002, when Riefenstahl was one hundred years old. She was taken to court by a Roma group for denial of the extermination of the Romani. As a consequence of the case Riefenstahl made the following apology, \\"I regret that Sinti and Roma had to suffer during the period of National Socialism. It is known today that many of them were murdered in concentration camps.\\" Influence Robert von Dassanowsky indicates that James Cameron's film Titanic echoes and even copies much of what can be found in Tiefland. The setting, of course is different, but the woman is tempted on one side by power and riches, and on the other side by the man-child character who offers true love. Dassanowsky sees strong parallels in the key scenes of both films.Robert von Dassanowsky: A Mountain of a Ship.

Oliver planned that the building both serve as a way to consolidate the management of his steel and coal operations, and as a way to leave a mark on the city's growing skyline. Oliver's location for the structure was once the original founding home of Mellon Financial from its start in 1869 until 1871 when the bank moved across the street and down a block. For many years, the primary tenants in the building were international law firm K&L; Gates, but in 2007, they moved to the larger Ariba Building, which became known as K&L; Gates Center. Since their departure, the building was only about 40% occupied for a number of years.

It consists of several buildings located on a one-acre (0.4 ha) parcel on Main Street between Clinton and Church streets. They reflect Napanoch's transition from its original settlement into the Delaware and Hudson Canal era and the move from Federal style to Greek Revival as the dominant style in American architecture. Buildings There are three main buildings in the complex, erected over a 30-year period. The oldest is the William Doll House, built around 1810 in the Federal style house by a local physician and his family. It boasts five bays and an unusual eight-panel door. The interior features some of the original fabrics, as well as later renovations, such as the staircase, that reflect Greek Revival fashions. It remains in use today as a private home. In 1833, the Hoornbeek Store was constructed to the south by Richard and George Southwick. They had been buying land in the area to take advantage of business from through traffic on the canal, which had opened five years earlier to carry coal from Northeastern Pennsylvania to Kingston, where it could be loaded on boats traveling down the Hudson River for New York City. Its Greek Revival features include the front porch with five heavy pillars, massive cornice, and tall frieze. Four years after it was opened, it was connected to the Doll House via a small addition when Doll bought out the Southwicks during foreclosure proceedings. Later owners in the 20th century added the second-story porches. Today it is vacant. The last main structure, the Napanoch Female Seminary, was built in 1841 by Gabriel Ludlum, who had leased the store from Doll. It is a simple two-story clapboard frame house, with unusual window locations due to its original use as a girls' school, with the schoolmaster's quarters on the ground floor and students housed upstairs. At one point, it, too, was connected to the store, probably in 1856 when Ludlum bought out Doll and became the sole owner of the complex. That connection was demolished in the 20th century. Scattered around the property are several outbuildings. These fulfilled service functions for customers and residents, such as an ice house, stables, wagon, and feed shed. History Ludlum leased the store and house to John Decker and Eli DuBois, who operated the former as a combination of shops and tavern and the latter as a hotel. In 1864, they bought the property from him, refurbished it, and then sold the house and store to the Hoornbeek family in 1867. It would remain in their hands for over a century, giving it its popular local name. Calvin Hoornbeek operated the complex as a combination of shops and apartments and willed it to his son L.D.B. when he died in 1890. He continued the business, living in the house and running the store, and in 1925 became the first person since Ludlum to own the whole complex when he bought the seminary building, which had passed through several owners since then. He rented it out as a single-family residence and continued to operate the store until his death in 1940. Various sons and daughters continued to live there until the last died in 1975. A subsequent owner, Amy Plummer Hoffman, got the property listed on the New York State and National Registers of Historic Places in the early 1980s.

It is located in the Bryggen area in the central part of the city of Bergen. It is one of the churches for the Bergen Cathedral parish which is part of the Bergen domprosti (arch-deanery) in the Diocese of Bj√∏rgvin. The large, gray stone church was built in a long church style using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 240 people. The construction of the church is believed to have started in the 1130s or 1140s and completed around 1180, making this church the oldest remaining building in the whole city of Bergen. There have been a few fires that burned the church, as well as several renovations and reconstructions, most recently in 2013. History St. Mary's Church is the only remaining of the twelve churches and three monasteries that were built in Bergen between its beginnings during the reign of Olav Kyrre (1066‚Äì1093, traditionally 1070) and the end of the twelfth century. Excavations have revealed the remains of an earlier stone church on the site, but it was probably never completed. Commissioned jointly by the king and the citizens and merchants of Bergen, the construction of St. Mary's Church began in the 1130s or 1140s. The exact year of completion is unknown, but the church is mentioned in Sverris saga as where the rebels of the Birkebein Party sought refuge when attacked by a peasant army in 1183. St. Mary's Church is likely to have been built by craftsmen from Scania, then part of Denmark. The church's style is reminiscent of that of Lund Cathedral in Scania. St. Mary's Church was significantly damaged in the town fire of 1198, caused by an attack on the city by the Bagli Party, enemies of the Birkebein Party. The rebuilding resulted in several architectural changes. Bergen burned again in 1248, in a fire which caused an even greater degree of destruction to the church than the earlier fire. As part of the reconstruction after this fire, the towers were heightened and the chancel lengthened. The church was damaged in several later town fires, but never again destroyed to the same degree as in the fire of 1248.

Reichborn (1768) Mariakirken in Bergen Norway.jpgPhotograph by Axel Lindahl from the 1800s Mariakirken.JPGPhotograph of the newly restored exterior front facade (2015) Although having been built as a parish church for the Norwegian population of Bergen, St. Mary's Church was taken over by the city's large German population in 1408 after which it was popularly called \\"the German church\\" (). The merchants of the Hanseatic League were centered on this part of the town. By belonging to the wealthy Germans, St. Mary's is richly adorned and escaped the fate of being turned into a ruin, unlike several of the other churches in the city. Not until 1874, long after the German domination in the city had vanished, did it again become an ordinary parish church, even though sermons were held in German until after the First World War. From 1863 until 1876, the architect Christian Christie (who would later supervise the restorations of Bergen Cathedral and the Haakon's Hall) oversaw a major restoration of the church. The church was again closed from January 2010 until 2015 for another major restoration work. Since then the church was made available to the Bergen Anglican Church, offering English language services for residents and tourists. Structure St Mary's Church is a two-towered, three-naved, mainly Romanesque-style church. The eastern part of the choir shows some Gothic influence reminiscent of the Haakon's Hall, likely caused by the reconstruction after the 1248 fire. The church is constructed mainly in soapstone, the oldest parts being built of the highest quality soapstone. Shale is used sporadically. At least three different types of soapstone is used, and it is likely that the stone comes from several different quarries in the region.

It resides in the soil in certain parts of the Southwestern United States, northern Mexico, and some other areas in the Americas, but its evolution was connected to its animal hosts. C. posadasii and C. immitis are morphologically identical, but genetically and epidemiologically distinct. C. posadasii was identified as a separate species other than C. immitis in 2002 after a phylogenetic analysis. The two species can be distinguished by DNA polymorphisms and different rates of growth in the presence of high salt concentrations: C. posadasii grows more slowly. It also differs epidemiologically, since it is found outside the San Joaquin Valley. Unlike C. immitis, which is geographically largely limited to California, C. posadasii can also be found in northern Mexico and South America. Early history As an intern in Buenos Aires in 1892, Alejandro Posadas described an Argentine soldier that had a dermatological problem since 1889. Posadas had seen the patient while a medical student in 1891 and skin biopsies revealed organisms resembling the protozoan Coccidia. The patient died in 1898 but during the interim Posadas successfully transmitted the infection to a dog, a cat, and a monkey, by inoculating them with material from his patient. In 1899 a 40 year old manual laborer from the San Joaquin Valley, a native of the Azores, entered a San Francisco hospital with fungating lesions similar to those of Posadas' patient. Dr. Emmet Rixford,Dr. Emmet Rixford died 1938-01-02- Retrieved 2017-01-22 a surgeon at San Francisco's Cooper Medical College, in attempts to determine the cause, concluded it was not from inadvertent self-inoculation. Further research produced a chronic ulcer in a rabbit and a lesion in a dog both excreting pus with the same organisms. Rixford issued a report, co-authored by Dr. Thomas Caspar Gilchrist (1862-1927),coccidioidal protozoan infection- Retrieved 2017-01-22 that was printed in 1896, one year after the patient died. A pathologist at Johns Hopkins Medical School and Gilchrist studied the material and determined the microbe was not a fungus but a protozoan resembling Coccidia. With the help of parasitologist C.W. Stiles, the organism was named Coccidioides (‚Äúresembling Coccidia‚Äù) immitis (‚Äúnot mild‚Äù). Four years later William Oph√ºls and Herbert C. Moffitt proved that C. immitis was not a protozoan but was a fungus that existed in 2 forms. In 1905 Oph√ºls called the infections \\"coccidioidal granuloma\\" and that it could develop from inhalation of the organism. Also in 1905 Samuel Darling studied a case and, referring to the misnamed organism a protozoan, named it Histoplasma capsulatum, meaning three major endemic fungi in the United States were all initially misidentified as protozoa. Studies by Cooke on the immunology of the disease, and in 1927 a filtrate of culture specimens, later named coccidioidin, began to be used in skin testing to delineate the epidemiology of infection. In 1929 a second-year medical student, Harold Chope, was studying C. immitis in the laboratory of Ernest Dickson at Stanford University Medical School, and breathed in spores becoming infected but he later recovered. In 1934 Myrnie Gifford, a physician at San Francisco General Hospital, joined the Health Department of Kern County, California. She had observed that San Joaquin Valley Fever patients often suffered from erythema nodosum, and all tested positive for coccidioidomycosis. She met Ernest County when he visited her in Kern County, California, and together they presented evidence to the California Medical Association. The two determined that San Joaquin fever represented C. immitis infection. The Kern County Health Department began obtaining epidemiologic histories and skin testing all cases involving Valley Fever. The investigations revealed, among other things, that a majority of the cases described a history of dust exposure, that coccidioidomycosis was common in the area, and that racial differences determined the host's response to the fungus. Chope left Stanford Medical School and Dickson recruited a classmate, Charles E. Smith, to replace him. Smith began an extensive 17-month study of coccidioidomycosis in Kern and Tulare County, that also began a lifelong professional focus of study of C. immitis and coccidioidomycosis, even after he became Dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley in 1951, until his death in 1967. Research by Smith resulted in more than a few discoveries that included serologic testing, that chlamydospores of the fungus c. immitis could be wind-blown dispersing the spores when the hot weather converted the soil to dust, scientific results of military personnel testing in the southern San Joaquin Valley before and during WWII, as well as people of Japanese descent (many US citizens) interned in camps, prisoners of war, and agricultural workers. Diagnoses of active disease and skin testing, showed that it was also found in southern Nevada and Utah, western Texas, as well as Arizona, where the southern and central areas appeared to impose the highest risk of infection in the United States. An important Smith's research added to the fundamental discoveries of microbiology, epidemiology, clinical findings, and diagnosis that had emerged since Posadas' initial case report in 1892.The Early History of Coccidioidomycosis: 1892‚Äì1945: Oxford journals, Retrieved 2017-01-22 Later history Progress in studies from 1997 to 2007, including genomic restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) concluded that there were two separate species. Earlier the two were referred to as types I and II, and later as Non- California and California distributions, determined as clades through microsatellite analyses. Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition (GCPSR) criteria were met, so the two entities were proposed and generally recognized as two separate species: Coccidioides immitis, and the novel species Coccidioides posadasii.Taxonomic and diagnostic markers for identification of Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii: From Medical Mycology August 2007, 45, 385-393- Retrieved 2017-01-22 References External links  *Coccidioides posadasii overview, life cycle image at MetaPathogen resource Category:Onygenales ","title":"Coccidioides posadasii"},{"id":"15086549","text":"Scott Kenneth McKillop (born March 4, 1986) is a former American football linebacker.

He was chief editor of Burke's Peerage/Burke's Landed Gentry from 1971 to 1983. Sometimes called the father of the modern obituary,McGinness, Mark (2008) \\"Father of the modern obit: Hugh Massingberd (1946‚Äì2007)\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, Weekend Edition, 5‚Äì6 January 2008, p. 56 Massingberd was most revered for his work as obituaries editor for The Daily Telegraph of London from 1986 to 1994, during which time he drastically altered the style of the modern British obituary from a dry recital of biographical data to an often sly, witty, yet deadpan narrative on the deceased person's life. Biography Massingberd began life as Hugh John Montgomery at Cookham Dean, Berkshire, in 1946. His father, John Michael Montgomery, was a member of the Colonial Service. His mother, Marsali Seal de Winlaw, was a schoolmistress who married John Montgomery after her first husband, Roger de Winton Kelsall Winlaw, died in 1942 on active service in the Royal Air Force. Hugh was the first child of her marriage to John Montgomery. Through his father, Hugh Massingberd was a great-grandson of women's-rights pioneer Emily Langton Massingberd.http://www.montyhistnotes.com/genealogy/familychart.php?personID=I6709&tree;=MontyHistNotes_IIhttp://www.montyhistnotes.com/genealogy/getperson.php?personID=I6693&tree;=MontyHistNotes_IIhttps://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/emily- caroline-massingberd_58960885 He was a great-great-grandson of Charlotte Langton (born Wedgwood) who was herself a granddaughter of the potter and philanthropist Josiah Wedgwood and a sister of Emma Wedgwood, wife of Charles Darwin.\\"Hugh Massingberd\\" (obituary). The Telegraph. 27 December 2007.https://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/edmund-langton_111355394 His boyhood enthusiasms included cricket, reading, horseracing, and showbusiness. His father John Michael Montgomery was the son of a brother of Field Marshal Sir Archibald Montgomery-Massingberd of Gunby Hall, Lincolnshire, while his mother was the sister of the Field Marshal's wife, Diana.Person 16709 at Monty History Notes To inherit their estate, in 1963 John and his son Hugh were obliged to adopt the name of Massingberd, and both decided to become Montgomery-Massingberds. However, in 1992 Hugh abandoned his original surname and thereafter was known simply as Hugh Massingberd. After leaving school, he worked for three years as an articled law clerk, before gaining a place at Cambridge University to read history. He then \\"drifted into publishing and journalism\\". He was extremely proud of his reputation as a gourmand and a trencherman, posing at one time for a portrait with a garland of sausages. Often retold was the story of his having eaten the largest breakfast ever served at The Connaught hotel in 1972; the head waiter reported to his table that the previous record holder had been King Farouk I of Egypt. In 1972 Massingberd married Christine Martinoni, with whom he had a daughter, Harriet, and a son, Luke. They were divorced in 1979 and he married, secondly, Caroline Ripley in 1983. Massingberd was known for his wit in his private life as well as in his public life as a writer. A friend once asked him, during one of Massingberd's low moods, what would cheer him up; after some thought, Massingberd replied, \\"To sing patriotic songs in drag before an appreciative audience.\\" Massingberd was diagnosed with cancer in 2004 and died on Christmas Day, 2007, five days before his 61st birthday. Career After leaving school at Harrow, Massingberd discarded initial plans to attend the University of Cambridge, instead choosing to work as a law clerk. He then moved to an assistantship at Burke's Peerage, the historic chronicler of the nobility and landed gentry of the British Isles. He was chief editor of Burke's Peerage from 1971 to 1983. Massingberd then worked as a freelance columnist for The Spectator and The Field until taking up a position with The Daily Telegraph in 1986. As obituaries editor at The Daily Telegraph, Massingberd entirely altered the reverential but otherwise factual style of the obituary. He replaced the traditional tone of respect with one of adroitly subtle humour, and quickly drew readership. The New York Times reported that \\"cataclysmic understatement and carefully coded euphemism were the stylistic hallmarks of his page.\\" He said his inspiration was Roy Dotrice's performance in 1969 in Brief Lives in the West End in which Dotrice, after reading out a \\"dull, formulaic entry about a barrister, shut the book with a 'Pshaw' and turned to the audience to say\\" 'He got more by his prick than his practice'.\\" Massingberd said that he resolved then \\"to dedicate myself to chronicling what people were really like through informal anecdote, description and character sketch\\".cited by McGinness, Mark (2008) \\"Father of the modern obit: Hugh Massingberd (1946‚Äì2007)\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, Weekend Edition, 5‚Äì6 January 2008, p. 56 He felt it was possible to give a true assessment of the subject and to present \\"a sympathetic acceptance, even celebration, of someone's foibles and faults\\". Massingberd famously referred to the 6th Earl of Carnarvon, a deceased man with a habit of indecent exposure, as \\"an uncompromisingly direct ladies' man.\\" He termed the late maverick Dead Sea Scrolls academician John Allegro, who later argued for Judeo-Christian cultism regarding mushrooms and sexual intercourse, the \\"Liberace of biblical scholarship.\\" Massingberd's sphere of influence was large. Following his editorship tenure, obituaries in not only The Daily Telegraph but in many other British publications, such as The Times of London, took on the dryly impish character for which his writings had become famous. He wrote over 30 books, many of them on the British aristocracy and the great houses of England, Scotland and Ireland, reviewed books for The Spectator, Country Life and the Telegraph, and also wrote a play based on the diaries of James Lees- Milne. A severe heart attack in 1994 forced Massingberd to undergo quadruple bypass surgery. During his recovery period, he wrote as The Daily Telegraphs television critic, but resigned in 1996. After his resignation, Massingberd continued to write, authoring book reviews for The Daily Telegraph as well as several theatrical works. When one of his theatre pieces, Love and Art, was produced at the Wallace Collection in 2005, Massingberd played one of the roles on stage.

Big Medium 1.0 was announced on January 13, 2003. The last release of Big Medium was version 2.0, released on December 17, 2007 after more than a year of public beta-testing. It was paid software distributed under a proprietary license. On February 19, 2012 the developer announced that there would be no additional development and support of the product. The name \\"Big Medium\\" is a double entendre, referring to both the Internet as a communication medium and to a medium as a psychic who helps ordinary people communicate with unseen worlds.Clark, Josh: The Complete Guide to Big Medium 2, 2. Audience Big Medium is billed as a CMS \\"aimed at web designers and their clients,\\" and unlike many general-purpose content management systems, it is intended to be easy to install and configure without the aid of a web developer. Big Medium's flexible design templates support a wide range of original designs and require no programming knowledge beyond HTML and CSS. Once these templates are configured, content editors can add and update pages with no specific technical knowledge. (Big Medium also comes with a modest library of design themes allowing non-designers to get started right away.) Big Medium targets traditional content sites such as news, marketing and magazine sites. It is pre-configured to provide features and data fields common to this type of site. While this simplifies the process of setting up Big Medium for a broad category of websites, this targeted pre-configuration makes the software relatively inflexible for managing other site types, including commerce or community sites. However, additional fields and content types can be added via custom plugin modules. Features * Simple, flexible templating for complete control over the design * Search engine-friendly URLs * Static pages * Rich-text editing with WYSIWYG editor or Markdown syntax * WYSIWYG CSS style editor * Version control for page edits * Libraries for images, documents, media and authors promote easy reuse * Auto-sizing of images and thumbnails * Image galleries and slideshows * Pullquotes * Visitor comments, with anti-spam features including built-in Akismet support * Tags and tag clouds * Site search * Extensible plugin support * Integrated link management * Manage multiple websites * Multiple editor accounts with category-specific editing privileges * Unlimited levels of nested sub- categories for pages * Syndication via RSS news feeds and JavaScript widgets * Standards-compliant HTML and XHTML * Lightweight publishing workflow * Scheduled publication of pages Technical details Big Medium installs on web servers running Windows NT, Windows 2003 or a Unix-like operating system. Big Medium stores its data in flat files and folders, rather than a database. This has advantages (e.g., simplified installation and backups) but also means that it is best suited for small- and medium-sized sites with fewer than several thousand pages. Clark has suggested that future versions may offer the choice between flat-file storage and a relational database to better support very large sites. Additional fields and content types can be added via custom plugin modules. Big Medium generates public web pages as static pages, meaning that they are not built on the fly with every page request but just once when the page is edited. This approach scales well under very high traffic conditions but means that there are limited opportunities to personalize pages for individual users. Big Medium supports plugins and can be extended via custom Perl code to add additional content types, data fields, content filters, display widgets, etc. This developer API was added in version 2.0, but the documentation for plugins is incomplete.

Since 1952 it has housed the Institut et Mus√©e Voltaire, a museum dedicated to his life and works. Voltaire's residency Voltaire and his niece and lover, the widow Madame Marie-Louise Denis, were looking for a new home. A property in Geneva meant that they could live beyond the legal reach of the French crown, an important consideration for Voltaire who was constantly in trouble with the authorities in France because of his writings. Although no Catholic, even a severely lapsed one like Voltaire, could own land in Protestant Geneva, he could lease a property. Through the efforts of friends and business associates in Geneva, Voltaire was granted permission to live within the confines of the city. Jean-Jacques Millet, a banker in Geneva, had a country residence on the hillside of Saint Jean just outside the city gates. It had a commanding view, gardens stretching down to the banks of the Rh√¥ne, and it came fully furnished. On January 19, 1755, Voltaire and Mme. Denis visited the property and were taken with it. They especially liked a long gallery that could be used to stage their theatricals (though theatre was forbidden in Geneva as immoral). On February 1, 1755, Voltaire received his permission to live in Geneva. A month later, on March 1, 1755, after a complicated series of negotiations (Voltaire drove a hard bargain), he and his niece moved into the property. They set about immediately to improve what was already a superb residence. They planted many different kinds of plants and herbs, including asparagus (grown in a greenhouse), and many fruit trees, including apples and late-fruiting peaches. Four gardeners, twelve servants, and twenty artisans worked on the property. Voltaire and his paramour renamed the house \\"Les D√©lices\\", and he wrote a poem in 1758 about his feelings for the house: > Here I am, by reason drawn to this retreat,/At peace, at liberty,/Freedom, > that wise divinity,/Whom all mortals desire, whose loss we all regret,/Is > here the source of my felicity.[...]/Study sustains me, and reason guides me > with its light;/I speak what I think, and I do as I will. After Voltaire In 1760, Voltaire left Les D√©lices for Ferney in France, and the house was then occupied by the Tronchin family. In the 1830s, when Colonel Henri Tronchin (1794‚Äì1865) was a lay president of the recently founded Evangelical Society of Geneva, Les D√©lices is reported to have been used as a repository for Bibles. In view of Voltaire's skeptical attitude to Christianity and its Bible, this ironic report continues to be widely circulated and embellished by religious apologists. Contrary to popular belief, Les D√©lices has never been occupied by the current incarnation of the Geneva Bible Society, which was only founded in 1917. The property was purchased by the city of Geneva in 1929, and today houses the Institut et Mus√©e Voltaire, a museum founded in 1952 and dedicated to the life and works of Voltaire.

Two prototypes were built and flown, but the type was never put into production. Design and development The Leopard was a twin-jet, mid- wing monoplane of composite construction with all-swept flying surfaces and jet fighter-like styling, apart from the podded engines, mounted on each side of the rear fuselage. The entire canopy hinged forward to allow access to the four reclining seats. A mockup was completed in 1982, leading to a prototype (registration ) built by the Designability company. The prototype first flew late in 1988. Development suffered a major setback when the engine manufacturer, Noel Penny Turbines, ceased business, leading to the grounding of the prototype. A second, refined prototype (registration ) was then constructed to use Williams International turbofans. This aircraft also incorporated a pressurised cabin, revised undercarriage, and a generally strengthened airframe. This second prototype was unveiled at the 1996 Farnborough International Airshow and first flew on 9 April 1997. The project never progressed beyond the two aircraft built, later redesignated Leopard Four to distinguish them from a six-seat variant proposed in 2001, the Leopard Six. The Six would not be able to use the EJ-22 engine due to exclusive deal between Williams and Eclipse. Chief aircraft designer and CMC chairman Ian Chichester-Miles died in 2009, bringing the enterprise to an end.

His last words were, \\"Por este Sol aprended a morir como yo.\\" After Tupac Amaru II's execution, leadership of the revolution shifted to Azangaro. The church bell tower, an example of colonial decorative adobe, was much disfigured by rains before recent rains caused a collapse of most of the tower. The gold interior is a magnificent example of rich colonial art. Recently, colonial treasures were robbed from the church. History Az√°ngaro was \\"discovered\\" by Captain Don Manuel Ortiz Aguilar on November 1535. The priest Rodrigo Chrysostom, overseer of the Doctrine of baptism of the Collao Indians in 1535, is the first to report on the existence Az√°ngaro, which was located in the place called Macaya and there an idol of a cat whose eyes were rubies was worshiped. When Christians brought indoctrination to this place, the doctrine of \\"Our Lady of the Rosary\\" was founded and a small church was built in the orders of the Dominico Father Tomas de San Martin and Acosta (the same who founded the University of San Marcos) and cacique Fabian Mango. The arrival of the Spanish in Az√°ngaro occurs in 1535. In 1542 the Viceroyalty of Peru covering 3 states are created: Lima, La Plata and Chile, this time Az√°ngaro and Puno belong to this Viceroyalty.

(20 September 1842 - 8 February 1917) was an Italian Cardinal of the Catholic Church. He served as Prefect of the Congregation for Religious from 1916 until his death, and was elevated to the cardinalate in 1911. He was Apostolic Delegate to the United States from 1902 to 1911. Biography Portrait of Archbishop Falconio by Thomas Eakins. Diomede Falconio was born in Pescocostanzo as one of the five children of Donato Antonio Falconio, a goldsmith, and his wife Maria Giacinta Buccigrossi. He received the Sacrament of Confirmation on 5 September 1852, and entered the Order of Friars Minor, more commonly known as the Franciscans, on 2 September 1860. Upon entering, he also changed his baptismal name from Angelo Raffaele Gennaro to Diomede from Pescocostanzo. Falconio studied at the Franciscan convents of Magliano and Carpineto, making his first vows on 17 September 1861 and his perpetual vows on 12 October 1864. In the autumn of 1865, he traveled to the United States, where he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop John Timon, CM, on 4 January 1866, in Buffalo, New York. Falconio taught philosophy at St. Bonaventure's College and Seminary in Alleghany from 1865 to 1871, serving as its President from 1868 to 1869. After doing missionary work in Terra Nova, he received American citizenship. In 1867 he was made Secretary of the American Franciscan province of the Immaculate Conception. Falconio served as administrator, chancellor, and vicar general of Harbor Grace between 1871 and 1882, and would have become its bishop had not the opposition of the Irish Benevolent Society to the appointment of an Italian bishop caused Falconio's superior to recall him to the United States. He performed missionary work in New York and Connecticut until 1883, whence he returned to Italy. From 1884 to 1889, he was the provincial of his religious order in the province of San Bernardino in Abruzzi. After becoming prosynodal examiner of the Archdiocese of L'Aquila, he was elected procurator general of the Franciscans in October 1889, and visitor general to the provinces of Naples and Apulia between 1889 and 1892. On 11 July 1892, Falconio was appointed Bishop of Lacedonia by Pope Leo XIII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following 17 July from Cardinal Raffaele Monaco La Valletta, with Archbishops Antonio Grasselli, OFM Conv, and Tancredo Fausti serving as co-consecrators, in the church of S. Antonio da Padova in Via Merulana. Falconio was later named Archbishop of Acerenza-Matera on 29 November 1895, the first Apostolic Delegate to Canada on 3 August 1899, and Titular Archbishop of Larissa in Thessalia on 30 September of that year. Falconio was appointed Apostolic Delegate to the United States on 30 September 1902. During his tenure, he dedicated himself to the spiritual care of the linguistic minorities, providing spiritual assistance in their language and nominating bishops of the same ethnic origin or who at least spoke their language. Falconio was created Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria in Aracoeli by Pope Pius X in the consistory of 27 November 1911, and opted to be promoted to Cardinal Bishop of Velletri on 25 May 1914. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1914 papal conclave, which selected Pope Benedict XV, who named Falconio Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for Religious on 26 February 1916. Falconio died in Rome on 8 February 1917. He is buried in the Franciscan church of his native Pescocostanzo.

Indian Singaporean cuisine refers to food and beverages produced and consumed in Singapore that are derived, wholly or in part, from South Asian culinary traditions. The great variety of Singapore food includes Indian food, which tends to be Tamil cuisine and especially local Tamil Muslim cuisine, although North Indian food has become more visible recently. Indian dishes have become modified to different degrees, after years of contact with other Singapore cultures, and in response to locally available ingredients as well as changing local tastes. The local forms of Indian food may be seen as localised or even regional variations of Indian food, or in some cases, a form of hybrid Indian-Singaporean cuisine. Popular 'Indian' dishes and elements of Indian cuisine (although sometimes prepared and sold by non-Indians) include: * Pickle - Indian pickle of mixed vegetables. Now also served by Chinese and Malays with their traditional food. * Nasi biryani - Popular Indian Muslim dish of saffron rice and meat. It is sold by both Indians and Malays, and is essential at Malay weddings.Tan, p.93. * Curry - The basic Indian vegetable or meat gravy. It is now ubiquitous in local Chinese and Malay 'traditional' cuisine. A Peranakan example is Laksa, whose name derives from the Sanskrit for 'hundred thousand'.Tan, p.108. A Eurasian example is Devil curry, while a Chinese example is Chilli crab.Tan, p.113. * Fish head curry - Iconic Singapore dish, invented by Indians (specifically one Mr. Marian Jacob Gomez, from Kerala) for the Chinese palate which values textures. Not found in India.Tan, p.109. * Indian Rojak - Salad of deep fried battered potatoes, eggs, seafood, tofu and other items. Served with a hot and sweet chilli sauce. The dish does not exist in India and is unique to Singapore and its region.Tan, p.86.Roti Prata with chicken curry. * Indian Mee goreng - Chinese yellow noodles, prepared 'Indian style' and fried with spices, minced meat, green peas and potatoes.Tan, p.112. * Murtabak - Roti Prata stuffed with minced chicken, mutton, beef or sardines. * Roti john - A split, panfried baguette topped with egg, minced mutton and onions, and served with ketchup.Tan, p.99. * Roti Prata - 'Singapore's answer to the croissant'. A popular supper after leaving nightclubs. Variations include durian and cheese prata. * Teh tarik - Literally 'pulled tea', named after its preparation technique. Compared to the cappuccino because of its frothy top. Other dishes were popular during the colonial period, when Indian ingredients and other culinary influences spread with the Empire to places like Singapore. Many of them endure in some homes and restaurants. Some of these dishes include: Komala Vilas South Indian restaurant in Serangoon (1996) * Mince with potatoes and peas - a pork mince cooked with cloves and soya sauce. Similar to Goan quema and Indian kheema.Tan, p.16. * Chicken Wrap - An Anglo-Indian chicken wrap, derived from the wraps, prepared by pepperbox.sg.Tan, p.20. * Panneer Wrap - A North-Indian Panneer wrap, derived from the wraps, prepared by pepperbox.sg.Tan, p.20. * Mulligatawny - An Anglo-Indian peppery curried soup, derived from the Tamil rasam.Tan, p.20. * Fish moolie - a spicy fish and coconut dish of possible Portuguese or Indian origin. * Curry tiffin - Another Anglo-Indian tradition, with the name derived from an Indian term for lunch. Features a curry as a main dish with various side dishes.Tan, p.21. * Pork vindaloo - Derived from a Goan vinegared curry, which likely came to Malacca with the Portuguese in the 16th century.

These include appam, bhatura, chutney, sambar, idli, muruku, putu mayam, samosa, tandoori, thosai, upma and various sweets, including jalebi, halva, laddu, paayasam and gulab jamun.

Early life His early education was received in Rimini from the brothers Speranza, who were local priests. He had classical studies at the College of the Scolopians in Urbino, of which the distinguished Latin scholar Father Angelo Bonuccelli was the rector. He entered his novitiate in Florence, on 30 Nov., 1838. From 1840-43, he studied philosophy and the exact sciences at the Ximenian College and Observatory, whose rector, the astronomer and geodete, Father Giovanni Inghirami, was at the same time professor of higher mathematics. Serpieri was only twenty years old when he was appointed instructor in mathematics and philosophy at the college of Siena. In Nov., 1846, his superior appointed him professor of philosophy and physics at the college of Urbino, while two months later the Papal Government called him also to the chair of physics in the university of the same city. On 27 Aug., 1848, he was ordained priest, and in Nov., 1857 he became rector of the college. He continued in this position and acted at the same time as professor until 1884, when the municipal authorities notified him of the impending secularization of education, both in the primary schools and in the colleges, inviting him, however, to remain as professor. This caused him and his colleagues to give up their positions at the college. Appointed to the rectorship of the Collegio della Badia Fiesolana, he died in the following year after a short illness. Astronomy Serpieri's chief merits as an astronomer rest in the observation of shooting stars. His first treatise on this subject dates from 1847 in the Annali di fisica e chimica of Maiocchi. In August, 1850, he discovered that the August meteors originate in a radiant not far removed from Gamma Persei (hence \\"Perseids\\", Ann. di Tortolino, 1850). In the same year, he established an observatory in Urbino, and thereafter published regularly in his monthly bulletin the results of his meteoric observations. These studies helped Giovanni Schiaparelli in the formulation of his theory on shooting stars. Serpieri himself expressed some views on this subject in his bulletin in 1867. Urged by Father Angelo Secchi, he went to Reggio Calabria to observe the total eclipse of the sun in 1870, and to ascertain the exact northern limit of the zone of totality. He declared the coronal streamers of the sun observable during the eclipse to be sun auroras caused by the electrical influence of the earth and other planets on the sun (Rendic, Ist. Lomb., 1871). When Schiaparelli called his attention to the work of the American George Jones, comprising 328 drawings of the Zodiacal light as observed at different times and from different places (published at Washington at the expense of the Government), he at once submitted it to analysis. This led him to his theory, in which he explains this phenomenon as light of the earth produced and maintained in the atmosphere by special solar radiations (La luce zodiacale studiata nelle osserv. di. G. Jones, 138 pp. in \\"Mem. Soc. Spettr. Ital.\\", 1876‚Äì81). The asteroid 70745 Aleserpieri was named after him. Seismology In his study of the earthquake of 12 March 1873, he was the first to introduce the concept of the seismic radiant. He explained the so- called premonition of earthquakes by animals by the hypothesis of a preceding electrical disturbance. His magnum opus is his study on the earthquake of 17 and 18 March 1875, which caused great devastation in his home city and in other places. He also wrote two memoranda on the 1883 earthquake in Casamicciola. His complete seismological studies, for which he received the gold medal at the General Italian Exposition in Turin (1884), were republished in 1889 by P. G. Giovanozzi.

Most games in the series are reissues of Game & Watch titles, but the series does include titles that were not from the original Game & Watch line. All of the Mini Classics titles are still officially licensed by Nintendo. Design Each Mini Classics unit is designed to look like a small Game Boy. Units typically have a D-pad and three buttons. A large action button that is also used for setting the alarm, and two smaller buttons typically marked \\"Game A\\" and \\"Game B\\" but could also serve different functions depending on the game. A keychain is attached to the top left hand corner, but could be removed. Most units also had stand on the back. Some games, however, do not have a stand, especially the Dual-screen releases such as Oil Panic and Donkey Kong. Similar to the Game and Watch, the Nintendo Mini Classics units have alarm clock features. Each unit is powered by two AG12/Button Cell/LR43 batteries, which are packaged with the Nintendo Mini Classic.

At the time of its release, King Vidor and Leslie Fenton were credited with its direction, although the DVD lists John Huston and George Stevens, who assisted with one of the segments, as well. The screenplay by Laurence Stallings and Lou Breslow, based on an original story by Arch Oboler, is similar in style to that of Tales of Manhattan (1942), another anthology film made up of several vignettes linked by a single theme. The picture stars Paulette Goddard, Burgess Meredith, James Stewart, Henry Fonda, Harry James, Dorothy Lamour, Victor Moore and Fred MacMurray. It marks the first joint movie appearance of Stewart and Fonda, who play a pair of musicians in their section of the film. Plot Oliver Pease (Burgess Meredith) has deceived his bride Martha (Paulette Goddard) into believing he's an inquiring reporter for the Los Angeles Daily Banner when, in fact, he is employed there as a classified ads clerk. When Martha suggests Oliver ask people on the street, \\"What influence has a baby had on your life?,\\" he submits the question to the real reporter, who dismisses it outright. Oliver approaches the editor and introduces himself as a representative of the publisher, who he claims wants to improve the feature by having Oliver roam the city and ask the question suggested by his wife. Jazz musicians Slim and Lank (James Stewart and Henry Fonda) mistake the word \\"baby\\" for \\"babe\\" and reminisce about a female trumpeter they met when their tour bus broke down in a rundown California seaside resort, where they tried to fix a talent contest so the mayor's son would win. Hollywood film star Gloria Manners (Dorothy Lamour) recalls the time she was hired to work with precocious child star Peggy Thorndyke (Eileen Janssen), who unintentionally triggered her big break in the movies, transforming her from a drab Iowa secretary into a Polynesian goddess. In a story similar to the O. Henry short story \\"The Ransom of Red Chief\\", successful stage magician Al (Fred MacMurray) relates how he and his buddy Floyd (William Demarest) once were con artists who stumbled upon young runaway and practical joker Edgar Hobbs in the woods. Upon learning he lived with his wealthy banker uncle, they conspired to return the boy and claim a reward, only to discover his uncle did not want him back. All ended well when Al married Edgar's sister and made the two siblings part of his magic act. At the end of the day, Oliver returns to the newspaper only to discover he's been fired from his real job for being AWOL. When he tells his wife what has happened, she surprises him by telling him she has known all along about his job and does not mind in the least. The paper's editor, impressed by the notes Oliver made while talking to his various subjects, arrives to tell him he likes his column and plans to print it, and asks how he thought of the question in the first place. Martha confesses it came to her because she's going to have a baby. Production notes The film's original title A Miracle Can Happen was inspired by a segment that was deleted from the film prior to its national release. In it, Charles Laughton portrayed a minister who is asked by a young boy to pay a visit to his dying father (Henry Hull). In an effort to boost the man's spirits, the minister offers an overly dramatic rendition of the Biblical story of David and Saul that sparks the man's full recovery. Only then does the minister learn the boy who had asked for his help actually had died years earlier. Producer Benedict Bogeaus thought the story was too serious for the otherwise comic film and replaced it with the Gloria Manners (Lamour) episode. According to co-producer/star Burgess Meredith, he showed the footage to David O. Selznick, who offered $500,000 for it with the idea he would release it as a short, but Bogeaus refused and the sequence was destroyed. Nonetheless prints of the film under its original title and with the Charles Laughton sequence intact are extant in European sources. The film opened as A Miracle Can Happen in New York City, Philadelphia, and Detroit in February 1948. Reviews were dismal‚Äîthe New York Daily News described it as \\"a million dollar cast in a ten-cent film\\"‚Äîand it was pulled from release. Public polls revealed most people thought the movie had a religious theme, so after the Charles Laughton episode had been removed and replaced by one with Dorothy Lamour, nine minutes thus being trimmed from the running time, it re-opened in June and was nationally released as On Our Merry Way, accompanied by an advertising campaign that emphasized it was a comedy.Turner Classic Movies This was the first joint film appearance of lifelong best friends James Stewart and Henry Fonda although the picture seems to have been completely forgotten in the publicity for their two subsequent movies together a couple of decades later titled Firecreek (1968) and The Cheyenne Social Club (1970). Dorothy Lamour spoofed her tropical screen image singing \\"Queen of the Hollywood Islands,\\" with Frank Loesser providing the music and lyrics. The song \\"Baby Made a Change in Me\\" was written by Skitch Henderson and Donald Kahn. Cast * Paulette Goddard as Martha Pease * Burgess Meredith as Oliver M.

In this particular instance, the pleasure of the actors seems to be a great deal more satisfying than that which the audience can expect.\\"New York Times review The Variety critic stated, \\"The cast couldn't have been better. The story's execution falters because a scene here and there is inclined to strive too much for its whimsical effect. But Meredith responds capitally to the mood of the character he plays, being given more of a chance to do so than any of the other stars.\\"Variety review ReferencesExternal links * On Our Merry Way at the Internet Movie Database Category:1948 films Category:American comedy films Category:American films Category:1948 comedy films Category:American black- and-white films Category:English-language films Category:United Artists films Category:Films directed by George Stevens Category:Films scored by Heinz Roemheld ","title":"On Our Merry Way"},{"id":"15087546","text":"Ituzaing√≥ Department is a department of Corrientes Province in Argentina.

Smith. It was originally built by Ted Smith Aircraft Company, which after 1978 became part of the Piper Aircraft Corporation. Design and development Ted Smith flew the first Aerostar 600 in October 1967. It was a mid-wing cantilever monoplane powered by two wing-mounted Avco Lycoming piston engines, with a tricycle landing gear. It was fitted with luxury accommodation for six. Also produced, and the base of most of the subsequent models, was a version with turbocharged engines, the Aerostar 601. During the time of production, the Aerostar held the speed record for fastest twin piston general aviation aircraft,\\"Certified Aircraft Database: Aerostar\\". Pilotfriend.com. Retrieved 24 February 2019. capable of cruise speeds from 220 kt (408 km/h) for the earliest 600 models to 261 kt (483 km/h) for the later 700 models. Light construction, low drag and high powered engines also contribute to fast climb rates. Operational history The aircraft were originally built at Van Nuys in California, when in 1968 the company was bought by the American Cement Company. The acquisition was not a success and in 1969 the company was sold again to Butler Aviation, owners of Mooney Airplane Company. The new company was named Aerostar Aircraft Corporation and it was intended to move production to a Mooney plant at Kerrville, Texas. In 1971 Smith attempted to purchase the rights, and announced he would be building an all-new design that was better than the Aerostar when initial deals broke down. In 1972 Ted Smith bought back all the rights to the aircraft and continued to manufacture Aerostars in Santa Maria, California. He also introduced the pressurized Aerostar 601P. The 601P had engines with higher-rate turbochargers to feed a cabin pressurization system. Another variant was the Aerostar 700 Superstar. In 1976 the company name was changed to the Ted Smith Aerostar Corporation. Ted Smith died in 1976. In 1978 the company was taken over by the Piper Aircraft Corporation. It continued to build two variants (600A and 601B) and then re-introduced the 601P and 602P. After discontinuing production of the non-pressurised models, Piper moved production to Vero Beach. The Aerostar was last built there in 1984. The Aerostar type certificate and manufacturing documentation were sold in 1991 to Jim Christy and Steve Speer, who had been part of the Ted Smith Aerostar operation, and now operate Aerostar Aircraft Corporation in Hayden Lake, Idaho, providing maintenance and support of the aircraft and new R&D; of its family of aircraft.{http://www.aerostaraircraft.com/founders.html} Conceived with a jet-powered design structure by Ted Smith from the very beginning, the Aerostar Aircraft Corporation continued its R&D; and finally completed Ted Smith's dream to convert the design into a twin fan-jet aircraft, with 6-seat (including 1 pilot) and its version of the 8-seat stretched variant.Hirschman, Dave. \\"Ted Smith's Dream: Record-setting piston twin sprouts jet engines\\".

The annexe in Scarborough Road (used for years 7 and 8, and some year 9 subjects) was closed in July 1991 due to a decline in pupil numbers, and taken over by Walsall College (WALCAT). Its first headteacher, until 1974, was Mr. Leslie Cox. His successor was Mr. Eugene M. Hughes, who served the school for 18 years until 1992, when he was succeeded by Miss Susan M. Bradford, who served the school for a similarly long period before leaving in December 2009 having gained a number of quality marks for the school, in particular, Investors in People. Andy Hubble became Headteacher in 2010, and was appointed Principal of the newly formed academy in 2012, until his resignation in February 2014 following an Ofsted inspection that ruled that the school's overall effectiveness was 'inadequate'.http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection- report/provider/ELS/138374 In the interim, Patrick Ottley-O‚ÄôConnor, former Principal of Oasis Academy MediaCityUK in Salford has assumed the role of Interim Principal.http://www.e-act.org.uk/our-academies/west-walsall-e-act- academy/ Mr Ottley O'Connor left Oasis Academy MediaCityUK in mysterious circumstances after Christmas 2014.http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester- news/head-25m-oasis-academy-mediacityuk-6148254  Campus  The school has extensive sports facilities including a football/athletics field, eight tennis courts, a heated swimming pool, a gym, a large Astroturf and, a significantly large sports hall.

It was the first instance of U.S. party regulars organizing as an independent political force outside their own party to support feminist principles, including the Equal Rights Amendment, reproductive choice, workplace equity, and, most controversially, a pledge to support only DFL candidates who would endorse the caucus principles. The other founders were Cynthia Kitlinski, Yvette Oldendorf, Mary Pattock (then Bremer), Jeri Rasmussen, and Peggy Specktor. Within a year, their grassroots organizing resulted in increasing the number of women in the Minnesota State Legislature from one to 14‚Äîall of them feminist. Their first legislative success, won in coalition with other women's groups, was ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. (State Republican feminists soon followed suit with a GOP Feminist Caucus.) The caucus subsequently gave up its independent status and became chartered by the DFL party. In 1980, although she was not a candidate, Horbal won five votes for President of the United States at the Democratic National Convention, which placed her after Jimmy Carter, Ted Kennedy and William Proxmire (see below).

The main house and plantation outbuildings were added to the National Register of Historic Places on July 22, 1994. History The house for Robert Gracey started in 1840 as \\"an unpretentious galleried farmhouse\\"https://sah- archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FAL-01-065-0017.xml?q=%28section%3AAL-01%29%20AND%20decade%3A1840s and was then expanded and renovated in the Gothic Revival style in 1852. The facade then resembled a rendering of ‚ÄúWaldwic Cottage‚Äù from volume two of William H. Ranlett‚Äôs \\"The Architect: A series of original designs for domestic and ornamental cottages and villas (1851).\\"https://sah- archipedia.org/detail%2Fcontent%2Fentries%2FAL-01-065-0017.xml?q=%28section%3AAL-01%29%20AND%20decade%3A1840s Ranlett could have been involved with the design of the renovation as he was retained by other wealthy southerners, but just as likely is that Ranlett‚Äôs design inspired the house and name (to which a ‚Äúk‚Äù was eventually added). The carpentry work was completed by Peter Lee and Joe Glasgow, skilled craftsmen enslaved by Captain H.A. Tayloe, who owned the neighboring Macon Station Plantation. Lee and Glasgow also built St. Andrew's Episcopal Church (Prairieville, Alabama) (1853‚Äì1854) in the Carpenter Gothic style and the decorative interior woodwork. Gracey's widow remarried after Robert's death to Willis Bocock in 1856. The 1860 United States Census of Marengo County indicates that Bocock enslaved 127 people in that year and the 1870s map of Hale County lists him as the owner still. The Waldwic property was originally within Marengo County, but this portion of Marengo was added to Hale County upon its creation in 1867. Robert Gracey's granddaughter, Bertha Gracey Steele, married at Waldwic in 1889 to William Micajah Spencer. He was a lawyer and was elected to the Alabama Senate in 1901. The house is one of only about 20 Gothic Revival residential structures remaining in Alabama. Other historic Gothic Revival residences in the area include Ashe Cottage in Demopolis and Fairhope Plantation in Uniontown.

He played college football at the University of Louisiana-Lafayette. Early years Cunningham attended Terrebonne High School, where he competed in football, baseball, tennis and track. As a senior, he contributed to the school winning the 1998 baseball district title. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. He was the team's kickoff specialist in his first 2 seasons. As a junior, he became the team's starter at placekicker, making 5-of-11 field goals. He hit a 50 and a 46-yarder in a 13-12 win against Northern Illinois University. As a senior, he made 8-of-10 field goals attempts and 15-of-15 extra points attempts. He had a 49-yard field goal in a 17-14 win against Western Kentucky. He made a career-high 3 field goals against the University of Tulsa. He finished his college career after making 13-of-21 field goal attempts and 31-of-32 extra points, for a total of 70 points. Professional career=Dallas Cowboys (first stint)= Cunningham sat out the 1993 season. He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1994 NFL Draft. On August 17, he was released after being beaten out by Chris Boniol. =Green Bay Packers= In April 1996, he signed with the Green Bay Packers in 1996. Although he had an excellent preseason, including a game-winning field goal against the Baltimore Ravens, the team released him on August 19 and decided to keep veteran Chris Jacke. =Dallas Cowboys (second stint)= On April 15, 1997, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys to compete for the starting job, after Chris Boniol left in free agency. He began his NFL career by making a 53-yard field goal in the season opener against the Pittsburgh Steelers (fourth longest debut field goal in league history). He made 5-of-5 field goals in the third game against the Philadelphia Eagles, to total 15 of the Cowboys' 21 points. He had 19 field goals in his first 6 career games, breaking Jan Stenerud's league record of 18. He set a franchise record of 12 consecutive games with a made field goal. He had a streak of 18 consecutive field goals made (third longest in franchise history). He was named to the All-Pro team at the end of the season. He was 34-of-37 on his field goal attempts (91.9%), leading the NFL in field goals made, setting the club record and ranking second for a rookie in league history. He was second in the NFL in field goal percentage and points scored (franchise record). He was 24 for 24 on extra points. In 1998, he tied a franchise record with a 54-yard field goal and made 29-of-35 field goal attempts, which at the time ranked third in club history. In 1999, he was limited with a sprained right ankle and was released 12 games into the season, after he slumped and made only 12-of-22 of his field goal attempts. He was replaced with Eddie Murray. =Carolina Panthers = On December 14, 1999, he signed as a free agent with the Carolina Panthers, to replace an injured John Kasay. On December 18, he tied a franchise single-game record by making 5 extra points against the San Francisco 49ers. He appeared in the final three games of the season, making 3-of-3 field goals and 13-of-14 extra points. In 2000, he played in the first 4 games of the season, making 5-of-7 field goal attempts and 9-of-9 extra points. He had a 25-yard attempt blocked in one contest and missed a 27-yard attempt against the Washington Redskins in a 7-20 loss. He was replaced with Joe Nedney. =Cincinnati Bengals= On March 16, 2001, he signed a two-year contract with the Cincinnati Bengals, to compete in training camp with Neil Rackers. He was released on August 27. =Jacksonville Jaguars= On November 27, 2002, he was signed as a free agent by the Jacksonville Jaguars, to replace a struggling Tim Seder. On December 3, he was cut after playing in one game, making a 23-yard field goal and 2 extra points. His release was done to sign placekicker Danny Boyd, who the club thought had a bigger potential. He finished his professional career with 84 for 105 field goal attempts. His 80 percent rate was tied for 27th All-time in a career. Personal life Cunningham also received some notoriety during his NFL career for sharing the same name of the Happy Days television character played by Ron Howard.

The effector domain may be a transcriptional activator (A) or repressor (R), a methylation domain (M) or a nuclease (N). Modification of the endogenous DNA-binding zinc finger domain is the basis of the most advanced field in construction of gene-specific artificial transcription factors. Linking together six ZFPs produces a target-site of 18-19 bp. Assuming specificity to that one sequence and that the sequence of the genome is random, 18 bp is long enough to be unique in all known genomes Indeed, the spacing between subsites becomes part of the target sequence due to restrictions in the flexibility of the protein which can be controlled. Targeting sites as small as 9 bp provides some degree of specificity, almost certainly attributable in some part to chromatin occlusion. Production of zinc finger protein domain Depending upon the requirements of the investigation, there are several techniques available to define a DNA- recognition domain that will confer the specificity of a ZFP-based transcription factor. Three phage display strategies have been described, involving either parallel, sequential or bipartite selection of the constituent zinc fingers. =Parallel selection= The parallel selection (Fig. 1 (A)) approach assumes that the individual zinc finger domains are functionally independent. On this basis, existing predetermined domains should be usable with no additional design or selection, making it a rapid and accessible technique to any laboratory. This is not true in every case, such that this strategy is liable to suffer issues related to target-site overlap at a number of target sequences, as discussed later. If necessary, it may be possible to surmount the problem of target site overlap by randomising the amino acid residues at the interface of two zinc fingers at which it occurs. =Sequential selection= Sequential selection (Fig. 1 (B)), put forward by the Pabo group in 1997 embraces the cooperative binding between zinc fingers to produce DNA-binding domains of great affinity and specificity. As suggested by the name, each finger is selected from a randomised library in the context of the previously selected finger. The techniques used in selection are similar to those described below except that the target oligonucleotide used in selection contains the entire target sequence. As shown in Fig. 1, a library is created in which finger three contains the randomised alpha-helix. The domain with the best binding characteristics is selected and then included in another library in which the finger-one anchor is removed and another randomised finger is added to the opposite end. This continues and results in a DNA-binding domain in which all fingers were selected in the context of the neighbouring finger and since each round of selection is applied to the same final target sequence, target site overlap still occurs but is an asset rather than a hindrance. The main drawback of this approach is the necessity to produce a separate library for each zinc finger, which exceeds the capacity of most laboratories. =Bipartite selection= The bipartite selection (Fig 1 (C)) method was proposed by Isalan et al., 2001 as a compromise between the parallel and sequential selection strategies. The first and last 5 bp of the 9 bp target site are selected in parallel and combined to produce a library from which the final ZFP is chosen. In order to keep the library size within reasonable limits, this technique is restricted to randomisation of only the key residues involved in base recognition. Furthermore, unlike in parallel selection, this technique requires multiple pannings before a novel ZFP can be constructed. =Zinc finger selection by phage display= In order to determine the most appropriate sequence of amino acids in the alpha-helix of a zinc finger for binding to a given DNA sequence, a technique involving phage display may be employed. By altering the genome of selected bacteriophage, it is possible to create a phage that will display a ZFP as part of its protein coat. Such phage can subsequently be tested for adherence, via the attached zinc fingers, to an oligonucleotide containing the sequence of interest, whilst other, non-adherent phage are washed away. The DNA within the phage codes for the ZFPs expressed, so extracting and sequencing the DNA of bound phage provides information as to suitable amino acid configurations for binding a specific sequence. This forms the basis of the investigation of ZFPs binding by phage display. Work is typically performed using the murine ZFP-TF Zif268 or one of its derivatives, as the basis of the zinc finger sequence modifications since it is the most well characterised of all zinc finger proteins. Its derivatives C7 or C7.GAT, are often used for their superior binding affinity and specificity. C7.GAT has been used to investigate the 5'-ANN-3' and 5'-CNN-3' families of sequences since the third finger of C7 defines a guanine or thymine in the 5' position of the finger two sequence (target site overlap). Filamentous helper phage and the DNA from lambda phage are utilised in phage display. Due to limitations in the size of libraries that can be routinely constructed, randomisation may be limited to the most influential amino acids in the ZFP sequence as inferred by X-ray crystallography. The positions were identified as helix positions -1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in fingers one and three, and positions -2, -1, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in finger two in a study published by Wu et al. (1995), however another study by Segal et al. (1999) suggests the importance of all positions from -2 to 6 due to the unspecific affinity of some amino acids and the ability of others to stabilise adjacent interactions. =In vitro selection of zinc fingers= A short (~34 nt) hairpin DNA containing the ZFP binding site with alterations occurring in a single subsite is used as the target. The oligonucleotide used may be synthesised to include a primary n‚Äëhexyl amino group at its 5' end, later utilised to attach bovine serum albumin (BSA). In this case, the conjugate is used to precoat a microtitre well, before applying ~1013 colony- forming units of phage. Following incubation, the phage are removed and the plate washed with buffer containing 0.5% Tween 20 to remove non-adherent phage. Using an acidic elution buffer, the adherent phage are removed and neutralised with Tris base. Further rounds of panning are completed to ensure enrichment of the sample, by infecting bacterial cells with the eluted phage and helper phage and then collecting the [ZFP-displaying] phage produced for the next round of panning. As an alternative to BSA, the hairpin target DNA may be biotinylated and later extracted using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (streptavidin forms very strong bonds with biotin). To increase the specificity of the selected phage, especially where larger libraries are being investigated, competitor oligonucleotides are used to sequester those zinc finger proteins of lesser specificity before the biotinylated target oligonucleotide is added. Sheared herring sperm DNA for example, will bind phage with a non-specific adherence to DNA. Subsequent rounds of panning involve increasing concentrations of specifically synthesised non-target oligonucleotides where all but the sequence of the target subsite remains the same, down to a single nucleotide difference. In particular, the target sequence of the original ZFP which was subject to mutagenesis is used in high quantity to select against 'parental phage' contaminating the library. The binding of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads can be blocked by blotto and antibody-displaying (irrelevant) phage so that binding only occurs to molecules with such a high affinity as biotin. Non-specific phage are removed as before, using a buffer including dilute Tween 20. Bound phage are collected by virtue of the magnetic beads and may be eluted by incubation with trypsin. Only those phage displaying highly specific ZFPs will thus be selected. After elution, the phage can be plated and DNA extracted from individual plaque forming units, restricted and the appropriately sized fragments extracted after separation by PAGE. The DNA can then be sequenced to discover the protein primary structure that produces adherence to the target sequence. This process is repeated for each of the 5'-NNN-3' single finger subsites being investigated. Engineered zinc finger arrays Generating arrays of engineered Cys2His2 zinc fingers is the most developed method for creating proteins capable of targeting desired genomic DNA sequences. The majority of engineered zinc finger arrays are based on the zinc finger domain of the murine transcription factor Zif268, although some groups have used zinc finger arrays based on the human transcription factor SP1. Zif268 has three individual zinc finger motifs that collectively bind a 9 bp sequence with high affinity. The structure of this protein bound to DNA was solved in 1991 and stimulated a great deal of research into engineered zinc finger arrays. In 1994 and 1995, a number of groups used phage display to alter the specificity of a single zinc finger of Zif268. Carlos F. Barbas et al. also reported the development of zinc finger technology in the patent literature and have been granted a number of patents that have been important for the commercial development of zinc finger technology.United States Patents 6,140,466, 6,140,081; 6,242,568; 6,610,512; 6,790,941; 7,011,972; 7,067,617; 7,101,972; 7,329,541; 7,151,201; 7,329,728; 7,378,510; 7,442,784; 7,741,110; 7,781,645; 7,833,784; Barbas et al. inventors Typical engineered zinc finger arrays have between 3 and 6 individual zinc finger motifs and bind target sites ranging from 9 basepairs to 18 basepairs in length. Arrays with 6 zinc finger motifs are particularly attractive because they bind a target site that is long enough to have a good chance of being unique in a mammalian genome. There are two main methods currently used to generate engineered zinc finger arrays, modular assembly and a bacterial selection system, and there is some debate about which method is best suited for most applications. =Modular assembly= The most straightforward method to generate new zinc finger arrays is to combine smaller zinc finger \\"modules\\" of known specificity. The structure of the zinc finger protein Zif268 bound to DNA described by Pavletich and Pabo in their 1991 publication has been key to much of this work and describes the concept of obtaining fingers for each of the 64 possible base pair triplets and then mixing and matching these fingers to design proteins with any desired sequence specificity. The most common modular assembly process involves combining separate zinc fingers that can each recognize a 3 basepair DNA sequence to generate 3-finger, 4-, 5-, or 6-finger arrays that recognize target sites ranging from 9 basepairs to 18 basepairs in length. Another method uses 2-finger modules to generate zinc finger arrays with up to six individual zinc fingers. The Barbas Laboratory of The Scripps Research Institute used phage display to develop and characterize zinc finger domains that recognize most DNA triplet sequences while another group isolated and characterized individual fingers from the human genome. A potential drawback with modular assembly in general is that specificities of individual zinc finger can overlap and can depend on the context of the surrounding zinc fingers and DNA. A recent study demonstrated that a high proportion of 3-finger zinc finger arrays generated by modular assembly fail to bind their intended target with sufficient affinity in a bacterial two-hybrid assay and fail to function as zinc finger nucleases, but the success rate was somewhat higher when sites of the form GNNGNNGNN were targeted. A subsequent study used modular assembly to generate zinc finger nucleases with both 3-finger arrays and 4-finger arrays and observed a much higher success rate with 4-finger arrays. A variant of modular assembly that takes the context of neighboring fingers into account has also been reported and this method tends to yield proteins with improved performance relative to standard modular assembly. =Selection methods= Numerous selection methods have been used to generate zinc finger arrays capable of targeting desired sequences. Initial selection efforts utilized phage display to select proteins that bound a given DNA target from a large pool of partially randomized zinc finger arrays. This technique is difficult to use on more than a single zinc finger at a time, so a multi-step processes that generated a completely optimized 3-finger array by adding and optimizing a single zinc finger at a time was developed. More recent efforts have utilized yeast one-hybrid systems, bacterial one-hybrid and two-hybrid systems, and mammalian cells. A promising new method to select novel 3-finger zinc finger arrays utilizes a bacterial two-hybrid system and has been dubbed \\"OPEN\\" by its creators. This system combines pre-selected pools of individual zinc fingers that were each selected to bind a given triplet and then utilizes a second round of selection to obtain 3-finger arrays capable of binding a desired 9-bp sequence. This system was developed by the Zinc Finger Consortium as an alternative to commercial sources of engineered zinc finger arrays. It is somewhat difficult to directly compare the binding properties of proteins generated with this method to proteins generated by modular assembly as the specificity profiles of proteins generated by the OPEN method have never been reported. =Applications= Engineered zinc finger arrays can then be used in numerous applications such as artificial transcription factors, zinc finger methylases, zinc finger recombinases, and Zinc finger nucleases. While initial studies with another DNA-binding domain from bacterial TAL effectors show promise, it remains to be seen whether these domains are suitable for some or all of the applications where engineered zinc fingers are currently used. Artificial transcription factors with engineered zinc finger arrays have been used in numerous scientific studies, and an artificial transcription factor that activates expression of VEGF is currently being evaluated in humans as a potential treatment for several clinical indications. Zinc finger nucleases have become useful reagents for manipulating genomes of many higher organisms including Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, tobacco, corn, zebrafish, various types of mammalian cells, and rats. An ongoing clinical trial is evaluating Zinc finger nucleases that disrupt the CCR5 gene in CD4+ human T-cells as a potential treatment for HIV/AIDS. Investigating binding characteristics These investigations require the use of soluble ZFPs, since attachment to phage can alter the binding characteristics of the zinc fingers. Once a ZFP has been selected, its sequence is subcloned from pComb3H into a modified bacterial expression vector, pMal-c2, linking it to a sequence coding the maltose binding protein. The recombinant is then transformed into XL1-Blue cells and expression is induced by the addition of isopropyl Œ≤-D- thiogalactoside (IPTG). Freeze/thaw extracts may then be purified for use in the following experiments. Whilst purification is not necessary for multitarget ELISA, it is essential for measuring binding affinity by plasmon resonance and DNase footprints. It can be performed using a Heparin-Sepharose FPLC column equilibrated with zinc buffer followed by confirmation of homogeneity by SDS PAGE gel densitometry The same techniques are used to examine the binding properties of completed polydactyl ZFP chimera =Specificity testing= The specificity of ZFPs selected by phage display, is tested using a multitarget enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ZFPs are applied to microtitre wells coated with streptavidin and a biotinylated target oligonucleotide. After incubation, the wells are washed to remove zinc fingers if they are not adherent to the target sequence, followed by the application of mouse anti-MBP (maltose binding protein) antibody and incubation. Goat anti-mouse antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase is added and allowed to bind, followed by washing to remove antibody, if it is not bound to zinc fingers. Alkaline phosphatase substrate is added and after stopping the reaction, the optical density at 405 nm (OD405) is determined by spectrophotometry The reading from the spectrophotometer is dependent on the amount of alkaline phosphatase present in the well, which in turn is proportional to the binding of the ZFP in question. If the ZFP binds to a sequence for which it was not selected with too great an affinity, it is not specific enough for most medical purposes and will most likely be rejected. These assays are repeated using different target oligonucleotides. When investigating zinc fingers binding 5'-XNN-3' sequences for example, all 16 of the possible oligonucleotide sequences will need to be investigated. Further, to test specificity to the 5' nucleotide, the full complement of the four 5'-ANN-3', 5'-CNN-3', 5'-GNN-3'. 5'-TNN-3' families are used as targets in four separate reactions and the relative binding in each is compared =Kinetic analysis= Kinetic analysis provides information regarding both the affinity and the specificity of zinc finger adherence to the target. It can be performed using commercially available equipment utilising surface plasmon resonance. The surface of the sensor chip is coated with affinity purified streptavidin before application of biotinylated oligonucleotides which also adhere to the surface. The association rate (kon) is calculated by measuring the rate of ZFP binding to the surface using several different protein concentrations whilst the dissociation rate (koff) can be calculated by increasing the rate of flow after association. The mathematics is performed by software provided with the instrument. Alternatively, Kd can be calculated from a gel mobility shift assay in which the same purified protein is incubated with serial dilutions of gel-purified, 32P-end-labelled target oligonucleotide. The incubation reactions are then resolved, over a short period, on a polyacrylamide gel and quantitated using a commercially available imager and software. Kd is calculated via Scatchard analysis using the binding isotherm equation; Œ∏b = [peptide]/([peptide] + Kd). =DNase I footprint analysis= To determine the space occupied by a ZFP when bound to its DNA target, a fragment of the target gene is amplified by PCR and mixed with a 32P-end-labelled promoter fragment. This reaction is then incubated with several different concentrations of ZFP produced and purified using one of the previously described overexpression (e.g. pMal-c2 and XL1-Blue) and purification methods. Digestion with DNase I will produce fragments of varying lengths, but where the ZFP has been allowed to bind at high concentration, the corresponding fragment lengths will not be present in the mixture, since DNase activity has been occluded by the ZFP at these locations. The samples are separated on an acrylamide (~6%), urea (8 M) gel, used to expose phosphorimaging plates and recorded by a commercially available phosphorimaging machine. Software analysis can also be used to produce Kd values =Target-site overlap= Certain sequences of amino acid residues are able to recognise and are specific to an extended target-site of four or even five nucleotides When this occurs in a ZFP in which the three-nucleotide subsites are contiguous, one zinc finger interferes with the target-site of the zinc finger adjacent to it, a situation known as target-site overlap. Zinc finger protein transcription factors ZFP-TFs, consisting of activators and repressors are transcription factors composed of a zinc finger protein domain and any of a variety of transcription-factor effector-domains which exert their modulatory effect around any sequence to which the ZFP domain binds. Zinc finger nucleases Zinc finger nucleases include a nuclease domain such as FokI, capable of introducing double-stranded breaks at the locus of any sequence to which the zinc finger protein domain binds.

The article, titled \\"The Nightmare of Steroids\\" and written by University of South Carolina football player Tommy Chaikin in collaboration with Sports Illustrated's Rick Telander, alleged the widespread use of steroids in the football program at the school. Following the article, a federal grand jury indicted four University of South Carolina football coaches in connection with steroid distribution to players. Three of the coaches pleaded guilty in plea- bargain arrangements and the fourth was acquitted. The episode was listed among \\"some of college football's biggest scandals\\" by sports reporter Tom Weir of USA Today.  \\"The Nightmare of Steroids\\"  \\"The Nightmare of Steroids\\" was featured in the October 24, 1988 issue of Sports Illustrated. The article begins with Tommy Chaikin, a defensive lineman on the University of South Carolina football team, vividly narrating his steroid-induced experiences the day before the annual South Carolina-Clemson football game in 1987. In his own words, Chaikin describes himself sitting in his dorm room on the USC campus with a loaded handgun pressed to his chin. The story continues in stream of consciousness fashion to describe how he had arrived at the brink of suicide, and includes other significant factors in his three-year odyssey with steroids including peer pressure, the physical and mental effects of the drugs on himself, the coaches he alleged were involved, and his eventual rescue by his father. In the article, Chaikin alleges that half the USC football team was using steroids, however this claim was never substantiated. Reaction Shortly after the article ran in Sports Illustrated, an investigation by South Carolina's Fifth Circuit Solicitor James Anders was announced. Based on the results of this preliminary investigation, a joint state and federal probe was announced on November 11, 1988. On April 19, 1989 a federal grand jury indicted USC defensive coordinator Tom Gadd, defensive line coach Jim Washburn, tight ends coach Tom Kurucz, and strength coach Keith Kephart in connection with steroid distribution to players. A fifth person, John Landon Carter of Bethesda, Maryland, was also charged with dispensing anabolic steroids to four former Gamecock players: Tommy Chaikin, David Poinsett, Heyward Myers and George Hyder. The indictments charged that illegal acts occurred from 1984 through December 1987. Gadd, Washburn, and Kurucz were accused of conspiring to \\"provide money to certain players and athletic personnel of the university for the purchasing of steroids for use by athletic personnel.\\" The indictments stated that the three monitored training programs to enhance steroid use and \\"would arrange to obtain sources for the purchase of unprescribed, misbranded steroids which were thereafter utilized by football players.\\" Kephart was charged with conspiring with other members of the USC athletic community to obtain steroids illegally across state lines, and the indictments charged that he and unidentified others \\"would administer the steroids to each other to improve athletic performance and to enhance physical appearance.\\" The United States Attorney, Vinton D. Lide, said he would not charge players or graduate assistants with crimes because he considered them to be victims. Outcome Following the indictments, Washburn, Kurucz, Kephart, and Carter entered into plea-bargain agreements with the federal prosecutor. They were awaiting sentencing when Gadd, who elected to fight the charges, was acquitted by a United States District Court jury on June 21, 1989. On August 10, 1989, the remaining four were sentenced. United States District Judge G. Ross Anderson sentenced John Carter to serve three months at a community security facility. Among the coaches, Tom Kurucz received the harshest sentence: six months in a halfway house and three years probation. Jim Washburn and Keith Kephart were sentenced to three months in a halfway house and given three-year probationary terms. The University of South Carolina received no sanctions from the NCAA as a result of these events.

Biography Hollins was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England, and was blind from birth. His mother died while he was young, and little is known about his father. After his mother's death, Hollins was sent to live with his \\"Aunt Mary\\", who gave him his first piano lesson. It is rumoured that Hollins had perfect pitch and, upon hearing any two notes on the piano, could name them. In 1878, Hollins enrolled at the Royal National College for the Blind at Upper Norwood. He impressed the Principal of his potential as a musician such that he was given the opportunity to study with Frits Hartvigson on the piano and Dr E.J. Hopkins on the organ. Hollins then presented several successful concerts including one at the Crystal Palace, where he performed the solo part of the Emperor Concerto, and a concert at Windsor in the presence of Queen Victoria. The opportunity arose for Hollins to study in Berlin under Hans von B√ºlow. While in Germany Hollins gave a series of concerts - at one time playing three concerti in the one evening - The Liszt Eb, the Schumann A minor and the Emperor. He played before the royal families of Germany and the Low Countries. In 1884, Hollins was given his first professional appointment as an organist, at St John's, Redhill. In 1885, Hollins appeared at the Music and Inventions Exhibition in 1885, playing the concert organ. Shortly afterwards another period of study presented itself at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt. In the ensuing eleven years, Hollins was organist at Upper Norwood Presbyterian Church, at the People's Palace (Crystal Palace) and teaching piano and organ at the Royal National College for the Blind. During this period Hollins also made a tour of the United States, and visited major concert halls at the time. Soon the Reverend Hugh Black, assistant minister at the Free St George's Church in Edinburgh persuaded the Presbyterian kirk to allow the installation of an organ at St. George's. An organ was procured. According to some stories, Black traveled to Nottingham to hear Hollins play, and offered Hollins the position there and then. Hollins accepted the offer and was then committed to St. George's for the rest of his life. Hollins did make multiple concert tours. In 1904, Hollins toured New Zealand and Australia. In 1907, 1909 and 1916 he went to South Africa to give a series of concerts at Johannesburg, Port Elizabeth, and Cape Town, giving the opening recital for the organ at the new Town Hall in Cape Town. He had been instrumental in developing the specification for the organ. On 2 and 9 August 1907 he played on the Feather Market Hall organ, Port Elizabeth, which at that time was the largest organ in South Africa. In 1913 he played in Germany, recording for the Welte Philharmonic Organ. In 1922, Hollins was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the University of Edinburgh. This was in addition to being made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Organists in 1904. In 1923, Hollins played at the inaugural recital of the Caird Hall Organ, Dundee, Scotland which he had designed. This famous concert organ was the first built by Harrison & Harrison, Durham, England and has been maintained by them since. It is a Grade 1 Historic Organ (BIOS) and is recognized as one of the finest instruments of its kind in the U.K. and further afield. In 1925/26 Hollins gave a major tour of the United States, during which he visited 65 cities. It has been estimated that Hollins traveled some 600,000 miles on his concert tours. In later years, Hollins wrote A Blind Musician Looks Back, his memories as an organist and teacher. He died in Edinburgh in 1942, aged 76.

Der Untergang des Egoisten Johnann Fatzer, is translated as Downfall of the Egotist Johann Fatzer or Demise of the Egotist Johann Fatzer and often called the Fatzer Fragment, or simply Fatzer.  Plot and importance  The plot, as far as it is consistent, centers around a group of soldiers who desert from the First World War and hide out in the German city M√ºlheim, waiting for a revolution; among them Johann Fatzer. Other figures vary. Conflicts arise between the individualistic behavior Fatzer‚Äôs and the group, first of all Keuner, representing an approach of (party) discipline, but none-the-less they seem to depend on Fatzer to see them through. Either way, they end up dead. :\\"KOCH :The battle hasn‚Äôt :Killed us, but :At calm air in the quiet room :We kill ourselves.\\"Brecht 1994, p61. \\"KOCH/Die Schlacht hat uns/Nicht umgebracht, aber/Bei ruhiger Luft im stillen Zimmer/Bringen wir uns selber um.\\" Like other plays produced in the context of the Lehrst√ºcke the Fatzer text is written in verse and contains passages for a commenting chorus. Many of the more elaborated fragments are speeches Fatzer‚Äôs or chorus segments. :\\"FATZER :All people at once own the air and the road :Free to roam in the stream of consorting :To hear human voices, see faces :I must be allowed to. :Is my live but short and soon over and amongst the walking :I will no longer be seen. Even in fight I have to breathe :Eat and drink as always. It may last forever :That is longer than me, and then I have, slain, :Not lived at all. The chest, too, withers :In the hideouts and to what purpose conceal :A degenerate man. All that is proof, that I can go :As I like and where I want to.\\"Brecht 1994, p69/70. \\"FATZER/Allen Menschen zugleich geh√∂rt die Luft und die Stra√üe/Frei zu gehen im Strom der Verkehrenden/Menschliche Stimmen zu h√∂ren, Gesichter zu sehen/Mu√ü mir erlaubt sein./Ist doch mein Leben kurz und bald aus und unter den Gehenden/Werde ich nicht mehr gesehen. Selbst im Kampf mu√ü ich atmen/Essen und trinken wie sonst. Vielleicht dauert er ewig/ N√§mlich l√§nger als ich, und dann hab ich erschlagen/√úberhaupt nicht gelebt. Auch die Brust wird verk√ºmmert/In den Verstecken und wozu noch verbergen/Einen verkommenen Mann. Das alles beweist, da√ü ich gehen kann/Wies mir beliebt und wohin ich will\\" Due to the inaccessibility of the text (until the early 1990s only few sections were published) and the fragmentary nature of it the Fatzer text isn‚Äôt as widely known as most of Brecht‚Äôs other plays. However, Brecht himself considered the Fatzer fragment as his highest standard technicallyBrecht: Arbeitsjournal. Entry from 25 February 1939 and considered re-using the Fatzer Verse in a project as late as 1951.Brecht: Arbeitsjournal. Entry from 10 July 1951 It was considered as being Brecht‚Äôs equivalent to Goethe‚Äôs Faust, that is a material which Brecht kept himself open, throughout his life, for experiment.M√ºller 1982, p. 147  Fatzer Document and Fatzer commentary  The overall fragment includes, besides the dramatic text (the \\"fatzerdocument\\"), instructive sections which Brecht calls the \\"fatzerkommentar\\" (Fatzer Commentary). Notable statements from the commentary regard the necessity of playing the document before interpreting it, the advice to always approach it taking into account to the most up-to-date practices and understanding of the arts at the timeSteinweg 1976, p. 73 and the suggestion to \\"throw the whole play apart\\" for experimental \\"Selbstverst√§ndigung\\".\\"Das ganze st√ºck, da ja unm√∂glich, einfach zerschmei√üen f√ºr experiment, ohne realit√§t! Zur ‚Äöselbstverst√§ndigung‚Äô\\". Steinweg 1976, p.77. Orthography and emphasis following the original. The term \\"Selbstverst√§ndigung\\" can be translated both as acquiring understanding of oneself as an individual as well as elaborating common understanding within a group. Brecht also reflects that he writes the Fatzer Document first of all as a form of examination for himself. He considers that he doesn‚Äôt have to finish it as it is this method of examination which can become the focus for recipients‚Äô own examinations. Literally: \\"The intention for which a work is produced is not identical with the way it is used.\\"Steinweg 1976, p.72 Brecht not only displays a significant shift with the Fatzer text from producing texts/drama as something to be put before an audience to using it as a means for the elaboration of meaning for himself: in the light of acquiring the concepts of materialistic dialectic for himself, he goes a step further in (rudimentary) laying this out as a general approach to theatrical elaboration as an ongoing process, emancipated from the delivery of productions, veering towards a concept of theatre characterized by participation rather than consumption.See in this respect e.g. Reiner Steinweg‚Äôs remarks about theatre as Politaeum at Reiner Steinweg: A 'Theater of the Future'  Context and interpretation  The Fatzer text, in particular the Fatzer Commentary was considered by Reiner Steinweg as contributions to Brecht‚Äôs conception of the Lehrst√ºcke as a form of pedagogical theatre intended for practicing participants rather than being staged by actors for an audience.Steinweg 1976 Reiner Steinweg was responsible for re-discovering and piecing together Brecht‚Äôs Lehrst√ºck theory, which he managed, in the 1970s, to get recognized as Brecht‚Äôs most radical and advanced aesthetical work, abandoned less due to formal maturation Brecht‚Äôs but as response to external political circumstances: the fight against Fascism, exile, then Brecht‚Äôs support in establishing the newly formed GDR. Heiner M√ºller, who played a central role in recognizing the Fatzer text as a major drama of the 20th century, interpreted this latest effort as a deliberate lowering of standards in an attempt to \\"clear out the bodies form the cellars, while the houses are built on the same foundations\\", identified as a crucial dilemma of GDR cultural politics. He holds against this the aesthetic quality and experimental possibilities of the Fatzer text, which, in its unresolvedness is closer to Kafka‚Äôs way of writing under the \\"pressure of experience\\".M√ºller 1982 The loose nature of the 500 pages of the Fatzer Fragment stand in stark contrast to the very concise form of the completed Lehrst√ºcke. The central theme of the confrontation of the individualistic urges of a strong (male) individual (Fatzer) versus the solidarity to a group is described by M√ºller as Brecht‚Äôs immense effort to consolidate the stance of his early plays with the new Marxist approach to the Lehrst√ºcke, as \\"attrition warfare Brecht against Brecht (=Nietzsche against Marx, Marx against Nietzsche)\\".M√ºller 1982, p. 140-149  Publication  Brecht himself published a 13-page fragment called \\"Fatzer, 3\\" in the first issue of the Versuche in 1930.Brecht 1930 The publication of \\"Der Untergang des Egoisten Johann Fatzer\\" is announced for an upcoming issue of the Versuche but never happened.

The essays in the back cover a wide range of topics, from kashrut to eschatology and everything in between. Some of the essays uphold the traditional view that the Torah is the divine word of God, while others challenge it and question the historicity of some of the biblical narratives.

It is located against the southern rim of the Mono Basin, south of Lee Vining, at an elevation of 7654 feet (2333 m). The majority of the developed community is spread narrowly along a five-mile stretch of California State Route 158, which is also known as the June Lake Loop Road, or in the populated areas, Boulder Drive. The Mono County Community Development Department defines June Lake's planning area to encompass the entire June Lake Loop, including the section of U.S. Route 395 between the north and south junctions of the Loop Road. The population was 629 at the 2010 census. In the Summer that can grow by 2500 visitors: fishermen, campers, tourists, backpackers, and other outdoors enthusiasts. The ZIP Code is 93529. Geology and geography The June Lake Loop is situated against the west rim of the Great Basin and Range Province, abutting the steep eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada. Rush Creek originates from an alpine watershed just north of the headwaters of the San Joaquin River, and south of the Tuolumne River, then flows northeast, becoming the major tributary to the great inland sea, Mono Lake. June Lake's looped valley, often described as a horseshoe-shaped canyon, was formed by glacial action. The Rush Creek glacier split in two when it encountered the resistant rock of what is now known as Reversed Peak. The main glacier flowed toward the north creating the Rush Creek Canyon. Another glacial branch turned south and east but its flow was impeded and eventually stopped as the granitic bedrock on this southern branch created an uphill path toward the volcanic area of the Mono Craters. When the glacier receded it left behind terminal moraine material in the area now known as Oh! Ridge. A basin which had been carved out just west of the ridge is filled with spring water, creating June Lake and nearby Gull Lake. The overflow from these spring-fed lakes flows back toward the mountain range and thus is named Reversed Creek. Reversed Creek reaches a confluence with Rush Creek and flows through Silver Lake and Grant Lake, completing the \\"loop\\" to the Mono Basin. Perched Boulder One notable geologic feature is the perched boulder, a glacial erratic next to the June Lake Fire Station. This boulder, a well-known landmark of the area, is 18 feet tall and weighs 150 tons. It was carried and deposited by glacial action to its present position. June Lake contains several distinct community areas. The main Village is between the southwestern end of June Lake, with the smaller Gull Lake on the northwest. The Village is the commercial core, with a post office, community center, library, restaurants, lodging, stores and offices, as well as mixed residential use. The West Village/Rodeo Grounds area lies on the North and West sides of Gull Lake. These areas are sites of more recent development including a baseball field, condominiums, and some larger homes. Over ninety acres of vacant land in this area are currently involved in a specific plan process. June Mountain Ski Area, adjacent to the Rodeo Grounds property, is owned and operated by Mammoth Mountain LLC under a use permit from the Inyo National Forest. Down canyon and closer to the dramatic eastern scarp of the Sierra Nevada are the Petersen, Williams, and Clark Tracts: then directly at the base of Carson Peak are the Dream Mountain and Silver Lake Meadow areas as well as the Rush Creek Power House. These \\"down canyon\\" areas are primarily single-family residential although several commercial nodes exist containing retail, lodging, dining and other services. There are also several outlying inhabited areas which are under lease from the Forest Service. These include the June Lake Junction and Pine Cliff Resort to the northeast of June Lake; Silver Lake Resort; the Silver Lake Recreation Residence Tract; and the Grant Lake Campground and Marina. At the northern Junction of the Loop road with U.S. Highway 395 is the Cain Ranch, on property owned by the City of Los Angeles. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 8.8 square miles (22.7 km2), 90.99% of it land, and 9.01% of it water. =Climate= This region experiences warm (but not hot) and mostly dry summers (with a few thunderstorms in late summer), and cold, snowy winters with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the K√∂ppen Climate Classification system, June Lake has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \\"Csb\\" on climate maps.Climate Summary for June Lake, California History The June Lake Loop has attracted fishermen, hunters, and hikers since the late 19th century. Its first inhabitants were the Paiute Indians of the Mono Basin. Although there was abundant mining activity in adjacent areas, the prospectors of the late 19th century found little of interest here. The area remained roadless, and was recognized only for its scenic and recreational value. During the decline of the mining era, interest developed in the new technology of Hydroelectric Energy. Horsetail Falls above Rush Creek PowerhouseBy 1915 a roadway was constructed up Rush Creek to just past Silver Lake, and a rail tramway system was moved from a defunct mine at nearby Bodie into the steep and rugged mountains above for the construction of two dams to provide Hydroelectric Power. The Rush Creek Hydroelectric Project was a significant step in the development of Hydroelectric Power in the State of California, and the Rush Creek Power House began producing electricity for distant cities in 1916. Silver Lake in the Winter The initial construction project continued through 1917, and during this time an employee named Roy Carson started the Loop's first private resort, known as Carson's Camp. The resort was a tent camp until 1920 when the first cabin was completed. A year later, after the completion of the first cabin another two cabins were erected in 1921. The new, larger cabin contained a dining room and a small area for a post office. This cabin is still in use as a store and restaurant for the historic Silver Lake Resort. Circa 1924 the U.S. Forest Service constructed another unpaved roadway from a point along U.S. Highway 395 to June Lake. Eventually Power Station employees and fishermen continued the road to connect with the road in the Silver Lake area. The road from the June Lake Junction made June Lake automobile accessible and made development in that area possible. Housing tracts were formed in between June and Gull Lakes and also near Fern Creek and Silver Lake. Boulder Lodge, on the shore of June Lake, was the second resort to be built in the June Lake Loop. In 1927 the Ed J. Seymour Company announced the construction of June Lake Lodge, (now a timeshare hotel known as the Heidelberg Inn) on the hillside overlooking June and Gull Lakes. The Lodge was to be operated in conjunction with a fish hatchery and fox farm, and included fifty rooms, a restaurant and bar, and a large four-sided fireplace in the lobby. June Lake Lodge opened in May 1928, and the hatchery produced an average of 1,000,000 small fish every year, distributed to the surrounding area's lakes and creeks. The fox farm was located near what is now the Pine Cliff area. Other camps and lodges sprung up, including Gull Lake Lodge, Fern Creek Lodge, Camp Culver, and Cherokee Lodge. Due to a larger volume of travel on Highway 395 a land lease permit was issued to the Carrington family so that they could create a service station with a repair shop and lunch room at the June Lake Junction. They called it \\"Crater Garage and Lunch Room\\". With the expansion of the community and its new permanent residents the necessity for a Post Office and school arose. The first United States Post Office in June Lake was established on October 1, 1927 and the first school in 1933. The school was run out of Fern Creek Lodge and the first teacher Mrs. Romana Power earned $1500.00 for a year. During this period, automobile touring had become quite fashionable, and with the completion of the Tioga Pass Road, June Lake became a popular destination and way point for those traveling between Yosemite and Southern California. Notably, many Los Angeles area dignitaries and Hollywood celebrities made their way here. Film star Wallace Beery built a cabin on a small island in Silver Lake. Beery was also an aviator and known to land his plane on the meadow area adjacent to the lake. Names such as Clark Gable, Charlie Chaplin, Betty Grable, Sally Rand and others graced the guest register at the June Lake Lodge. Subsequently, film director Frank Capra and cartoonist Walter Lantz also had cabins at Silver Lake, and their families continue to visit. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power since 1923 had been seeking to purchase water rights in the Mono Basin to increase the capabilities of their aqueduct system. And, by 1935, the Mono Basin Project was underway. Water was captured from nearby Parker Creek, Walker Creek and Lee Vining Creek and diverted to Rush Creek at Grant Lake, where a large earthfill dam was constructed. An eleven-mile tunnel was dug under the Mono Craters to deliver this water to another new reservoir at Crowley Lake. This water project was approaching its completion by the time the Second World War began. The Loop's population swelled appreciably during those years, as a temporary company-town settlement was developed at the East Portal of the tunnel, about two miles from Grant Lake. Most of the supervisors, private contractors, foremen, and City specialists for the aqueduct project found lodging in June Lake. Restaurants, bars and dance halls proliferated, along with some gambling activity and a bawdy house or two. Glen Colton's \\"Tiger\\" Bar was established in 1932 and still holds one of the State of California's two longest standing alcoholic beverage licenses. By the summer of 1940 the June Lake Fire District in conjunction with the United States Forest Service constructed the first municipal water system for the June Lake Village area. Inmate labor was utilized during this construction, and what was known as a \\"Spike Camp\\" was established to house those workers. Carson Peak It was also during this time that the sport of skiing was becoming popular in the United States, and by around 1937 there was an organized race called the \\"Silver Skis.\\" Participants started near the Fish Hatchery, hiking to the top of 10,866 foot Carson Peak and skiing back down. By 1940, a group of local businessmen established the June Lake Winter Sports Association, building and operating a 2200-foot rope tow ski area with a vertical rise of 600 feet, including first aid, ski instruction and repair, light lunches, and entertainment. The ski lift was powered by a small private hydroelectric plant on Fern Creek, as no commercial electricity was yet available. Another private generation facility was established at the Carson's Camp/Silver Lake Resort. The California Electric Power Company finally constructed local distribution lines and established power service to the Loop area in 1946. Prior to that time oil lanterns were used, and refrigeration was accomplished by sawing blocks of ice from the surface of June Lake during winter, storing them for future use in a large ice house located on shore next to the boat landings. By the 1950s June Lake had two competing grocery markets: Louie's Market which had been in business for 20 years and was owned and operated by Louis and Pauline Prole and their daughters Louise and Jocelyn and the newer June Lake General Store owned by Al and Jean Matlaf. Louie's Market had a wide variety of services including a bakery, ice cream fountain, groceries, necessities, hardware, cold storage for local fisherman and hunters as well as a deli and meat counter. Louis was a trucker and brought in his own supplies to keep the cost down; he also knew produce and only the best would do for his customers and friends. During the long haul, he would often stop along 395 and deliver fresh produce to the locals, many of whom still remember him with a smile. There were also numerous other services including service stations; automotive repair and towing; sport and tackle shops; hardware and dry goods; even an arcade featuring pinball machines and the like. June Lake at the time was one of the more important commercial centers of the Eastern Sierra region. A new, larger school with a teacher's residence had been constructed near the Rodeo Grounds. In 1955, motel owner Edward Krause and associate Frank Roberts established one of the earliest Community Antenna Cable systems, making June Lake the only town in the area to offer television to its motel guests. June Lake in the Fall The ski area had been unable to survive during the WWII years, but in late 1958 the Forest Service announced its intention to offer a permit for a new ski area at June Mountain. W.C. \\"Bud\\" Hayward obtained the use permit and built a full-service ski area with a double chairlift and T-Bar, which opened in February 1961. During his tenure as owner of the ski resort until 1986, Hayward expanded the terrain and facilities including the addition of a rope tow, poma lift, and three additional double chairs. The community of June Lake retained its commercial vitality through the 1970s, with the addition of a banking branch, hardware and paint store, welder, auto body repair, art and pottery galleries, and more. Since that time however, there has been a steady economic decline marked by the growth and boom of the nearby Town of Mammoth Lakes, which drew most of the commercial activities away from its outlying communities. Demographics=2010= The 2010 United States Census reported that June Lake had a population of 629. The population density was 71.6 people per square mile (27.7/km2).

The homeowner vacancy rate was 8.1%; the rental vacancy rate was 11.7%. 327 people (52.0% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 300 people (47.7%) lived in rental housing units. =2000= The 2000 United States Census reported the population of June Lake to be 613. For 2003, the California Department of Finance estimated the population to be 626. In 2000, 4% of the population was under 5 years old, 17% were from 5 to 17, 71% were from 18 to 64, and 8% were over 65. The median age was 41.4. Sixty-six percent of the households were owner occupied and 34% were rented. Only 615 of June Lake's 1,187 parcels have been developed. June Lake's population is highly seasonal: 223 households are full-time residences and 571 are part-time. Including seasonal visitors, June Lake may have a temporary population of 2,900. The Mono County General Plan provides for an additional 3,970 dwelling units in June Lake. Community June Lake is known as a quaint resort community, with an authentic hometown atmosphere. The chief industry is tourism, with lodging and vacation rentals ranging from cottages and cabins to motels and full-service resorts. The newest addition to the town is the Double Eagle Resort and Spa. This property offers luxurious accommodations along with a pool, Jacuzzi, fitness center, massage therapy, a restaurant and bar. Other places to stay include: Boulder Lodge, Gull Lake Lodge, The Haven, Four Seasons, Silver Lake Resort, Reverse Creek Lodge, Lake Front Cabins, June Lake Villager Inn, June Lake Pines Cottages, Whispering Pines, June Lake Motel, Heidelberg Inn, the Knoll Haus, Fern Creek Lodge, and Big Rock Resort. There are also Vacation Homes and Condominiums available for transient occupancy. During the fair weather months, the June Lake Loop offers RV camping at: Silver Lake Resort RV Park, Pine Cliff Resort, June Lake RV Park, Golden Pine RV Park, and Grant Lake Marina. There are also public Campgrounds on the lands of the Inyo National Forest at Oh! Ridge, June Lake, Gull Lake, Reversed Creek, and Silver Lake. Groceries are available at the June Lake General Store, as well as the smaller Fern Creek Store, Silver Lake Resort, and at the June Lake Junction, which also has gasoline and diesel fuel. The town offers dining at the Carson Peak Inn, Tiger Bar and Caf√©, Eagles Landing Restaurant, Ohanas, Silver Lake Caf√©, Alpine Deli and Pizza, and The Lift. A number of galleries and gift locations feature local artists' works, including pottery and wood carvings. Access to the lakes for boat launching is provided at two marinas on June Lake and one each on Gull Lake, Silver Lake, and Grant Lake. Sporting goods and winter ski rentals are provided at Ernie's Tackle Shop. June Lake and Gull Lake looking east from June Mountain From December through April, the June Mountain Ski Area is the center of activity for June Lake. In addition to its 500+ acres of ride able terrain for all abilities and types of skiers and snowboarders, the ski resort features breakfast and lunch in the Grand Chalet with a commanding view of the lakes below and the entire Mono Basin. There are also equipment rentals, a winter sports school, as well as sport shop which also features gifts and souvenirs. Local jobs are generally service or retail related, although there are some contractors including builders, electricians and plumbers. Many residents commute to work in Lee Vining, Mammoth Lakes, or even further to Bridgeport or Bishop. Over fifty percent of all private residences in June Lake, however, are second homes. Most of these part-time occupants are here during summer months, leaving their June Lake homes dark for the winter. Historically, June Lake's summer residents have comprised a vital and active part of community life. During winter, the majority of the workforce for the June Mountain Ski Resort is housed at employee housing facilities in Mammoth and provided with daily bus transportation by their employer. Tourism and activities Fall Colors Because the community is built on hills and meadows in this subalpine valley surrounded by high mountain peaks, it has been dubbed the \\"Switzerland of California.\\" The area is most famous for its trout fishing, which occurs in many modes: trolling or still fishing the lakes from a boat, float tubing, or shore fishing the many lakes and streams. Bait fishing is productive and popular, as are spin casting with lures and fly fishing. Rush Creek below the Grant Lake Dam is restricted to catch-and- release. The lakes are cool in temperature but swimming is possible in the midsummer months. There is a swimming beach on June Lake near the Oh! Ridge campground. Speed boats are restricted on the smaller lakes but speedboats and personal watercraft are allowed on Grant Lake, making waterskiing and wakeboarding also possible. Hiking is a favorite pastime of the area: June Lake offers many trails that lead into the nearby back country of the Ansel Adams Wilderness Area. Most of the hikes, including Fern Lake, Reversed Peak, and Agnew Lake are strenuous and vertical, with the exception of the Parker Lake Trail which is a 2-mile hike that only climbs 400 feet in elevation. The Frontier Pack Train at Silver Lake offers equestrian day rides, as well as backcountry trips. Ample opportunities exist for mountaineering, climbing and bouldering activities, mountain or road bicycling, off-highway vehicle travel, photography, bird watching, and more. In Autumn, an abundance of Aspen groves change from green to gold and red hues as winter approaches. Winter brings snow and cold temperatures, but there are many sunny days during which skiing, snowboarding, ice climbing, ice skating, snowmobiling, sledding and snow play, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, and winter mountaineering and touring may be enjoyed. Education June Lake is in the Eastern Sierra Unified School District. The local June Lake Elementary School was abandoned and torn down in the 1970s, and school bus transportation is provided to Lee Vining. Children attend Lee Vining Elementary School. High School students may attend Lee Vining High School, or alternatively, the Eastern Sierra Academy, if they qualify. Some parents seek inter-district transfers to the Mammoth Unified School District. June Lake has a public library. Fire Protection District June Lake is the seat of the June Lake Fire Protection District, which was established in 1939. The fire protection district covers an area of approximately , including not only June Lake but also the nearby unincorporated areas of Pine Cliff, June Lake Junction, and the down canyon area of the June Lake Loop from the June Lake Village to Silver Lake. The District maintains two fire houses. Public Utility District June Lake is also the seat of the June Lake Public Utility District, which was established in 1947. The June Lake Public Utility District provides water and sewer service to an area of within the June Lake Loop. The water supply is based on diversion rights, split between the Village and Down Canyon areas of June Lake, totaling approximately per day. Distribution is effected by of pipes.

These are usually partial orders, so that one random variable A may be neither stochastically greater than, less than nor equal to another random variable B. Many different orders exist, which have different applications. Usual stochastic order A real random variable A is less than a random variable B in the \\"usual stochastic order\\" if :\\\\Pr(A>x) \\\\le \\\\Pr(B>x)\\\\text{ for all }x \\\\in (-\\\\infty,\\\\infty), where \\\\Pr(\\\\cdot) denotes the probability of an event. This is sometimes denoted A \\\\preceq B or A \\\\le_{st} B. If additionally \\\\Pr(A>x) < \\\\Pr(B>x) for some x, then A is stochastically strictly less than B, sometimes denoted A \\\\prec B. In decision theory, under this circumstance B is said to be first-order stochastically dominant over A. =Characterizations= The following rules describe cases when one random variable is stochastically less than or equal to another. Strict version of some of these rules also exist. #A\\\\preceq B if and only if for all non-decreasing functions u, {\\\\rm E}[u(A)] \\\\le {\\\\rm E}[u(B)]. #If u is non-decreasing and A\\\\preceq B then u(A) \\\\preceq u(B) #If u:\\\\mathbb{R}^n\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} is an increasing function and A_i and B_i are independent sets of random variables with A_i \\\\preceq B_i for each i, then u(A_1,\\\\dots,A_n) \\\\preceq u(B_1,\\\\dots,B_n) and in particular \\\\sum_{i=1}^n A_i \\\\preceq \\\\sum_{i=1}^n B_i Moreover, the ith order statistics satisfy A_{(i)} \\\\preceq B_{(i)}. #If two sequences of random variables A_i and B_i, with A_i \\\\preceq B_i for all i each converge in distribution, then their limits satisfy A \\\\preceq B. #If A, B and C are random variables such that \\\\sum_c\\\\Pr(C=c)=1 and \\\\Pr(A>uC=c)\\\\le \\\\Pr(B>uC=c) for all u and c such that \\\\Pr(C=c)>0, then A\\\\preceq B. Other properties If A\\\\preceq B and {\\\\rm E}[A]={\\\\rm E}[B] then A \\\\overset{d}{=} B (the random variables are equal in distribution). Stochastic dominance Stochastic dominancehttps://www.mcgill.ca/files/economics/stochasticdominance.pdf is a stochastic ordering used in decision theory. Several \\"orders\\" of stochastic dominance are defined. *Zeroth order stochastic dominance consists of simple inequality: A \\\\preceq_{(0)} B if A \\\\le B for all states of nature. *First order stochastic dominance is equivalent to the usual stochastic order above. *Higher order stochastic dominance is defined in terms of integrals of the distribution function. *Lower order stochastic dominance implies higher order stochastic dominance. Multivariate stochastic order An \\\\mathbb R^d-valued random variable A is less than an \\\\mathbb R^d-valued random variable B in the \\"usual stochastic order\\" if :{\\\\rm E}[f(A)] \\\\le {\\\\rm E}[f(B)]\\\\text{ for all bounded, increasing functions } f:\\\\mathbb R^d\\\\longrightarrow\\\\mathbb R Other types of multivariate stochastic orders exist. For instance the upper and lower orthant order which are similar to the usual one-dimensional stochastic order. A is said to be smaller than B in upper orthant order if :\\\\Pr(A>\\\\mathbf x) \\\\le \\\\Pr(B>\\\\mathbf x)\\\\text{ for all } \\\\mathbf x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R^d and A is smaller than B in lower orthant order if :\\\\Pr(A\\\\le\\\\mathbf x) \\\\ge \\\\Pr(B\\\\le\\\\mathbf x)\\\\text{ for all } \\\\mathbf x \\\\in \\\\mathbb R^d All three order types also have integral representations, that is for a particular order A is smaller than B if and only if {\\\\rm E}[f(A)] \\\\le {\\\\rm E}[f(B)] for all f:\\\\mathbb R^d\\\\longrightarrow \\\\mathbb R in a class of functions \\\\mathcal G.Alfred M√ºller, Dietrich Stoyan: Comparison methods for stochastic models and risks. Wiley, Chichester 2002, , S. 2. \\\\mathcal G is then called generator of the respective order. Other stochastic orders=Hazard rate order= The hazard rate of a non-negative random variable X with absolutely continuous distribution function F and density function f is defined as :r(t) = \\\\frac{d}{dt}(-\\\\log(1-F(t))) = \\\\frac{f(t)}{1-F(t)}. Given two non-negative variables X and Y with absolutely continuous distribution F and G, and with hazard rate functions r and q, respectively, X is said to be smaller than Y in the hazard rate order (denoted as X \\\\le_{hr}Y) if :r(t)\\\\ge q(t) for all t\\\\ge 0, or equivalently if :\\\\frac{1-F(t)}{1-G(t)} is decreasing in t. =Likelihood ratio order= Let X and Y two continuous (or discrete) random variables with densities (or discrete densities) f \\\\left( t \\\\right) and g \\\\left( t \\\\right), respectively, so that \\\\frac{g \\\\left( t \\\\right)}{f \\\\left( t \\\\right)} increases in t over the union of the supports of X and Y; in this case, X is smaller than Y in the likelihood ratio order (X \\\\le _{lr} Y). =Mean residual life orderVariability orders= If two variables have the same mean, they can still be compared by how \\"spread out\\" their distributions are. This is captured to a limited extent by the variance, but more fully by a range of stochastic orders. Convex order Convex order is a special kind of variability order. Under the convex ordering, A is less than B if and only if for all convex u, {\\\\rm E}[u(A)] \\\\leq {\\\\rm E}[u(B)]. =Laplace transform order= Laplace transform order compares both size and variability of two random variables. Similar to convex order, Laplace transform order is established by comparing the expectation of a function of the random variable where the function is from a special class: u(x) = -\\\\exp(-\\\\alpha x). This makes the Laplace transform order an integral stochastic order with the generator set given by the function set defined above with \\\\alpha a positive real number. =Realizable monotonicity= Considering a family of probability distributions ({P}_{\\\\alpha})_{\\\\alpha \\\\in F} on partially ordered space (E,\\\\preceq) indexed with \\\\alpha \\\\in F (where (F,\\\\preceq) is another partially ordered space, the concept of complete or realizable monotonicity may be defined. It means, there exists a family of random variables (X_\\\\alpha)_{\\\\alpha} on the same probability space, such that the distribution of X_\\\\alpha is {P}_\\\\alpha and X_\\\\alpha \\\\preceq X_\\\\beta almost surely whenever \\\\alpha \\\\preceq \\\\beta . It means the existence of a monotone coupling.

Origins The University of California, Berkeley, had a substantial tradition of student political activism ranging from peace agitation in the 1930s to resisting McCarthyism during the loyalty oath controversy of the 1950s. The first stirrings of the Civil Rights Movement in the mid-1950s prompted a challenge by Ralph Shaffer, graduate student representative on the ASUC (Associated Students of the University of California) Senate, to discriminatory practices of fraternities and sororities. The group's ultimate goal, however, was to end the legacy of McCarthyismAshbolt, A Cultural History, pp. 69-70 The group hoped to achieve this goal by calling for abolition of the House Un-American Activities Committee, which was viewed as one the biggest obstacles to student rights. In 1957 a campus political party called Toward An Active Student Community (TASC) was organized by Fritjof Thygeson, Rick White and others. It ran candidates in the student government election. Its requirement that candidates be accountable to TASC, based on the British parliamentary system, was fiercely attacked in the Daily Californian (UCB's student newspaper). TASC's candidates ran on a liberal platform, and were substantially defeated. The next semester, Mike Miller, an undergraduate representative on the ASUC Senate, resigned and organized a slate of candidates to run on a platform supporting racial equality, free speech on campus, voluntary ROTC (participation in ROTC was mandatory at the time for freshman and sophomore men), and participation in the National Student Association. They doubled the electorate and received between 35-40% of the vote.Cloke, Brief History, pp. 20-27. Encouraged, the candidates, joined by Thygeson, White, Peter Franck, Marv Sternberg, and Wilson Carey McWilliams, formally established SLATE as a campus political party in February 1958 (the name was not an acronym, but simply stood for a slate of candidates who ran on a common platform). The university administration approved SLATE as a student organization, but not as a political party. In the spring of 1959 the first and only SLATE student body president, David Armor, was elected, along with four other representatives, with strong support from graduate students. The university administration quickly responded by announcing that graduate students would no longer be considered members of the Associated Students and thus would be ineligible to vote in the student elections. SLATE continued to contest student elections, raising issues of free speech and academic freedom, as well as the right of students to take positions on such \\"off-campus\\" public issues as racial discrimination, capital punishment, civil liberties, war and peace, and farm worker organizing. Over the course of 1959 Berkeley Chancellor Clark Kerr developed a set of directives governing the rights of student organizations to sponsor speakers and prohibiting taking stands on \\"off-campus\\" issues. SLATE led the opposition to the Kerr Directives.Cloke, Brief History, pp. 31-48; Rorabaugh, Berkeley at War, pp. 14-17; Horowitz, Student, pp. 17-22. SLATE took positions on a number of controversial public issues that emerged in its first years. It supported a Berkeley fair housing ordinance in 1959, opposed the hearings conducted by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in San Francisco in May 1960, supported the national Woolworth-Kress boycott called by civil rights organizations, opposed the execution of Caryl Chessman at San Quentin, and opposed continued nuclear weapon testing.Cloke, Brief History, pp. 49-77; Freeman, At Berkeley in the '60s, pp. 39-46; Goines, The Free Speech Movement, pp. 65-82. SLATE also continued its advocacy for on- campus issues, including an end to compulsory ROTC, elimination of the Communist speaker ban, academic freedom, the rights of student organizations, and an idealistic critique of Kerr's instrumental vision of the modern University.Payne, Walls, and Berman, \\"Theodicy,\\" The Activist, Spring 1962; Max Heirich and Sam Kaplan, \\"Yesterday's Discord,\\" in Lipset and Wolin, The Berkeley Student Revolt, pp. 10-35. Articulating these positions were Ken Cloke and Michael Tigar, two SLATE representatives elected to the ASUC Senate in the early 1960s. SLATE served as an umbrella group for students whose politics ranged from Young Democrats to Trotskyist, and never became the exclusive possession of any one political sect or grouping. As Mike Miller put it, SLATE followed a politics of the \\"lowest significant common denominator,\\" in maintaining a multi-issue student organization committed to democracy, human rights, and peace.Miller, \\"Organizing for Social Change\\", Social Policy, Winter 2000. As word of students protests at Berkeley spread, campus political parties were organized at a number of American universities, including San Francisco State, Michigan, Iowa, UCLA, Riverside, Chicago, and Illinois.About SLATE, pp. 11-12. Banned from campus Public reaction to UC students participating in the demonstrations against HUAC, pickets against discrimination, and vigils against capital punishment was putting pressure on UC Regents and administrators. As SLATE continued to insist on the right to take stands on \\"off-campus issues,\\" the university administration responded by banning SLATE from the campus\\"UC Ousts Liberal Club,\\" News-Call Bulletin, June 10, 1961, p. 1 (the ban was later reversed). Beginning in 1960 and continuing for four years, SLATE sponsored a series of summer conferences. The 1962 SLATE summer conference, \\"The Negro in America,\\" featured Charles McDew, chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and led to the formation of Bay Area Friends of SNCC. The 1963 SLATE summer conference, \\"Education in the Multiversity,\\" criticized Clark Kerr's vision of the university, the role of universities in the Cold War, and argued for an expanded concept of student rights and academic freedom in university reform. As one of its educational reform projects, in fall 1963 SLATE began publishing The SLATE Supplement to the General Catalog, evaluating campus departments, courses and instructors.Freeman, At Berkeley in the '60s, pp. 64-67. Impact of the FSM In fall 1964, the issue SLATE had promoted since its founding, the right of student groups to give support to off-campus causes, came to a head over the right of students to place tables at the entrance of the campus to solicit members and contributions for a variety of issues. Leading the defense of these rights were a number of students who had been to Mississippi for Freedom Summer, or were otherwise involved with civil rights protests in the Bay Area. The Free Speech Movement that emerged from the University's attempt to arrest and expel students who led the protests was even broader than SLATE's coalition, as the FSM included Young Republicans and supporters of Barry Goldwater for President in the 1964 election. SLATE members were active in the FSM, but in general were not the leaders. SLATE won five positions on the Associated Students in the fall 1964 election, but failed to take over the student government when it only elected two representatives in Spring 1965, and lost the campaign for student body president as well. SLATE then attempted to draft a new student government constitution, but the proposed document was voted down in a referendum in April 1966. With many students feeling that student government was a hopeless arena for change, SLATE voted to dissolve itself in October 1966.Freeman, At Berkeley in the '60s, pp. 274-5. The SLATE Supplement to the General Catalog became part of the student government and continued publishing until 1971. Reunions The first reunion, attended by some 150 former SLATE members (out of an estimated 850 one-time dues-paying members), was held at the Berkeley campus in June 1984 with considerable media attention. A survey revealed that most who attended were still active in left- of-center politics, although there were exceptions. David Armor, SLATE's only student body president (who did not attend), had made an unsuccessful run for a Los Angeles Congressional district in 1982 as a Reagan Republican,Kaiser, \\"Radical Group,\\" Wall Street Journal. and Rick White, who did attend, found his neoconservative views treated respectfully but not shared. In an emotional session, SLATE women recalled the sexism they had encountered from male leaders in the organization.Lubenow, \\"SLATE Reunion,\\" Newsweek. Two former SLATE members in attendance had achieved success in California electoral politics: Jackie Goldberg served on the Los Angeles school board and city council (and would later serve in the California Assembly from 2002 to 2006), and Bill Lockyer was then in the midst of his 25 years in California State Legislature, and would go on to serve as Attorney General of California (from 1999 to 2007) and state Treasurer (2007 to 2015). A second SLATE reunion was held in 2000 at a retreat center, and a third half-day reunion was held in conjunction with the 40th anniversary reunion of the FSM in 2004.

The stadium is located at 128 Vyacheslav Chernovol Street, the city of Ivano-Frankivsk 750447. It has a capacity of 15,000 spectators and 6,500 individual plastic seats. By the end of its renovations the capacity of Rukh should be over 20,000 at the end of renovations. Overview The stadium is being built in sectors, with only one remaining to be finished. The turf and the stadium in whole are useful for many sporting events. The stadium has two big stands located across one another and gather the majority of spectators. The stadium is located in the city park named after Taras Shevchenko. Nevertheless, according to stadion.lviv.ua of April 20, 2010 that is referencing to the head of the Capital Construction Directorate of Ivano-Frankivsk city administration V.Kovalchuk Rukh requires nearly four million hryvnia to bring Rukh to the initially pre-designed form.Rukh needs four million Among the mentioned issues there were: *a system of artesian aquifer and sprinklers, *pavilions for the substitution players and coaches, *a stand cover for at least 500 seats, *dressing rooms for players and coaches, *a press-media room, *parking for buses and cars. The stadium reconstruction has already stretched now for a record of over 20 years and became a joke in local folklore. In general the stadium is finished and meets the requirements of the Ukrainian First League, however still additional funds are needed to resume renovations. In 2008 the city mayor Viktor Anushkevichus informed that city is actively seeking new investors for the stadium and has intentions finally finish the overall reconstruction prior to the 2012 European finals.Gazeta po-kievski According to Galician Correspondent on July 15, 2010 the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast parliamentarians petitioned to the Cabinet of Ministers to provide them with finds to improve the condition of the stadium.Rukh Stadium need help from the Cabinet History According to the local newspaper Match the first game took place on July 4, 1909 when the local sport club Rewera played against the Czarni-2 Lwow, losing 1:3. The match took place in the Jordan Park of the youth games and festivities in the city of Stanislau, the owner of which was Miejska Kasa Oszczednosci. The first stand was built in 1927 out of wood, which was in service until long after the establishment of FC Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk (1950s). Around the time the stadium was given the name Spartak (previous name is not known - presumably City Stadium of Potocki Park). In 1956-57 the first known reconstruction took place when the other 4,000-seat stand was erected totaling the stadium's capacity at 10,400. In 1969 there were built the floodlights towers and the wooden scoreboard was replaced with the electronic containing a clock as well. In 1981 the stadium was renamed as Krystal (). At the end of 1986 a new reconstruction of the stadium has started which was halted in 1989 due to lack of the funds. Some works were renewed in 1996 that eventually were once again brought to the halt. Until the 2006 season, the stadium was the home ground of FC Spartak Ivano-Frankivsk, the main soccer club/team in the oblast. Since 2007, the stadium is home to FSC Prykarpattya Ivano-Frankivsk, which used to play its games on the local university field (University of Nafty and Gazu). Rukh is located in the Shevchenko Memorial Municipal Park in the city of Ivano-Frankivsk. Not far from Rukh Stadium is a reserve stadium, Electron, which is also located in Shevchenko Park. That stadium was a temporary home for Ivano-Frankivsk clubs while major renovations occurred at Rukh Stadium. Recently the reconstruction was renewed by a new design which was represented by the architect company Atelye Arkhitektury Plus (author Ya.Doroshenko). After the reconstruction as it was planned before the stadium's capacity should increase over 20,000 mark. The pictures of the proposed design were posted at the forum on the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast football website on May 23, 2010 (the link provided below). Name The stadium was renamed in 1989 in honor of the Civil movement Rukh led by Vyacheslav Chornovil (today political party Rukh).
