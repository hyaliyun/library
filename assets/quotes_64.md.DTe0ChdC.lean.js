Biography Kazimierz Stabrowski came from a Polish landed gentry (ziemia≈Ñstwo) family. His father Antoni was a military in the Russian Army and his mother Sofia Pileckis came from a rich Polish family. In the years 1880 to 1887, he completed his education in Bia≈Çystok, after which he studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg, where he was taught by Pavel Chistyakov, later (from 1895) in Ilya Repin's workshop. At the academy he gained contacts with numerous Polish painters, inter alia with Ferdynand Ruszczyc, Kazimierz Wasilkowski, Henryk Weyssenhoff, and Stanis≈Çaw Bohusz-Siestrze≈Ñcewicz, as well as with Russians. In 1893, he went on artist travels to the East, Beirut, and Palestine, in which he visited Odessa, Istanbul, Greece, and Egypt. Throughout his journey, he gathered a portfolio of work, he did his diploma painting Muhammad in the desert (The escape from Mecca) (Mahomet na pustyni (Ucieczka z Mekki)) during his travels. In the years of 1897 to 1898, he did his further studies at the Acad√©mie Julian in France; it is there where he met numerous academics inter alia Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant, and Jean-Paul Laurens, and has been introduced into the artistic movements of Impressionism and Fauvism. In Paris he also became interested in the philosophy of Henri Bergson. After coming back to St. Petersburg, he participated in the regional sphere of artists, where he made numerous artworks, which he exhibited inter alia Paris, (at the World's fair in 1900), Munich (1901), and Venice (1903). In 1902, he married Julia Janiszewska, a sculptor, who he met at the Imperial Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg. From 1902, he became a member of the Society of Polish Artists \\"Sztuka\\" (Towarzystwo Artyst√≥w Polskich \\"Sztuka\\"). In 1903, he moved to live in Warsaw, where he engaged in organisation and pedagogue. Together with Konrad Krzy≈ºanowski he operated a private art school, which led to the reopening of the then closed after the January Uprising, School of Fine Arts in Warsaw. The school opened on March 19, 1904. Kazimierz Stabrowski became the first director of the school, performing this function to 1909. His most famous pupil there was Lithuanian painter Mikalojus Konstantinas ƒåiurlionis Due to a conflict with the Pedagogue Council, and the Tutelary Committee, after being involved in Western esotericism, he dismissed himself. By that time, he was in fact the leading figure in the Theosophical Society in Poland, and had founded the first Theosophical lodges there, and he transmitted his Theosophical ideas to ƒåiurlionis. The years of 1909 to 1913, marked his second artist travels, inter alia France, Germany, Sweden, Spain, Italy, and the Canary Islands. The summer months he spent with his family in L≈´znava Manor (D≈Çu≈ºniewo), Latvia. He visited Lithuania frequently and was instrumental in organizing the first art exhibitions there. After World War I, he moved to St. Petersburg, when in 1918, he moved back to Warsaw. After new aesthetics in Russia after World War I, his work gained criticism by pedagogues, and positive views by the journal Mir iskusstva. In the 1920s, he travelled again to find new artistic themes, to Greece, Turkey, Morocco, Bosnia, Sweden, and Norway. In 1922, he co-founded the artist group Sursum Corda. He died in 1929, he was buried at the PowƒÖzki Cemetery (Quarter 205-I-8) in Warsaw.

Education Katherine Bashford was born August 19, 1885, in Prescott, Arizona, one of four children of Coles and Henrietta (Parker) Bashford. The Bashfords were a prominent political family: Katherine's great-uncle was Coles Bashford, one of the founders of the Republican Party. In 1894, the family moved to California, where Katherine would spend most of her adult life. Bashford was educated at the Polytechnic High School in Pasadena and the Marlborough School for Girls, from which she graduated in 1905. She also studied at the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles, but as a designer she was to a large extent self-taught. Her education in landscape architecture amounted to some time traveling around Europe viewing gardens just before World War I and again in 1924‚Äîespecially Spain and Italy, which have climates similar to southern California‚Äîand a two-year apprenticeship with the California landscape architect Florence Yoch beginning in 1921. Landscape architecture career =Solo work= Bashford began designing flower gardens out of her home, on a small scale, in 1917. Following the professional training she received with Yoch, she opened her own office in Pasadena in 1923, specializing in gardens for private residences. She hired as office manager Hinda Teague Hill, an author and former schoolteacher, who helped Bashford promote her business by publishing articles on landscape design. She later hired a trained landscape architect with engineering skills, Beatrice M. Williams, to help work on the large gardens that were coming into vogue. In 1928, she moved her office to downtown Los Angeles, where it would remain for the rest of her career. Bashford's combination of artistic talent and business skill made her one of the most respected southern California landscape architects and kept her in demand throughout her 25-year career. Architects like Wallace Neff, H. Roy Kelley, Roland Coate, and Reginald D. Johnson, worked with her repeatedly. Although Bashford's aesthetic as a landscape designer was influenced by European models, on the whole she leaned away from traditional landscaping‚Äîshe disliked foundation plantings, for example‚Äîand towards a more informal style that emphasized simplicity and human scale. Her gardens made good use of native plants and those adapted to the southern California climate, and she was one of the handful of early-modern landscape designers who experimented with gardens as usable spaces and outdoor rooms. She was a proponent of massing flowers by color to create abstract compositions, and a number of her designs featured the flower-bordered walkways, patios, low tiled fountains and benches, fruit trees, and use of large potted plants as accents than are now staples of southern California residential landscaping. As a contemporary writer observed admiringly of her work, Bashford's \\"desire and aim has been to make gardens and home settings comply with the California spirit... she is first and last a real artist.\\" Bashford's clients included Mrs. Harry J. Bauer, Mrs. Harry Gray, John and Grayson Barber, Kenyon and Patricia Reynolds, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur K. Bourne, and William C. McDuffie. The last of these commissions won her one of the several awards she would receive from the American Institute of Architecture's southern California chapter. Other sites she worked on were the Bush House in Pasadena, the Gate House in Carpinteria, and the Sterry House in Los Angeles. She also created a walled garden featuring plants associated with California's Spanish missions for the restoration of El Molino Viejo in San Marino, a nineteenth century building that started life as a water mill for Mission San Gabriel. Bashford occasionally wrote on landscape architecture for the magazine California Southland. Her work was praised in Architectural Digest, California Arts & Architecture, and other magazines. =Bashford and Barlow= In 1930, landscape architect Fred Barlow, Jr. began working as her assistant and became her office manager in 1931 when Hill left the firm. The Great Depression put a large dent in Bashford's business, however, and in 1934 Barlow took a leave to do other work. In 1936, with business picking up, Bashford invited Barlow to become a partner in her firm, which was known thereafter as Bashford and Barlow. Bashford and Barlow designed numerous residential gardens, as well as landscaping for Pepperdine College, a hotel, and a church. Barlow was a champion of public housing, and together they designed landscaping for the public housing projects Ramona Gardens (1940), Aliso Village (1942, now defunct), Rancho San Pedro, Harbor Hills in Lomita, Avalon Gardens, and Normont Terrace. Most of these were developed by the Los Angeles Housing Authority and/or the U.S. Housing Authority on very limited budgets. A Los Angeles Times article on Aliso Village gives an idea of Bashford and Barlow's approach to landscaping for public housing: :\\"[The idea was to] restore much of the former beauty and some of the early California flavor it had when the tract flourished as a vineyard first planted by the Mission fathers. To the few pepper and eucalyptus trees that have withstood the test of time will be added such plants as the white oleander, California olive and walnut, Brazil pepper, live oaks, evergreen grape vines, various types of English ivy and crepe myrtle.‚Äù Later years Bashford was elected a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) in 1936. A year later, she and Barlow were involved in founding the southern California chapter of the ASLA. In 1938, she became the society's first woman chapter president. In 1937, Bashford and Barlow's work was included in the San Francisco Museum of Art's \\"Contemporary Landscape Architecture and Its Sources,\\" the first exhibition on this subject in a major U.S. museum. Suffering from a heart condition, Bashford retired in 1943, turning over her practice to Barlow. She died on June 3, 1953. Legacy Bashford's gardens are not well documented, and many of them have been changed, but those that remain testify to her mastery of landscape design. In 2013, the KenCott Manor garden Bashford designed for Kenyon and Patricia Reynolds in 1928 was under consideration for the National Register of Historic Places.

He is professor at the University of Louvain (UCLouvain).  Contributions  David de la Croix and his co-authors Raouf Boucekkine and Omar Licandro developed a unified framework encompassing longevity, education and economic growth. The basic link is that a longer life expectancy justifies a greater investment in education (this is called the Ben Porath mechanism in the related literature), which in turn fosters economic growth by promoting human capital accumulation. The resulting model has been taken to several sets of demographic data pertaining to the 17th and 18th centuries, providing evidence on the role of demographics in the Industrial Revolution. This conclusion is reinforced by the work with Omar Licandro on famous people, which provides a broad picture of the evolution of the longevity of the elite over the last centuries, using a database of hundreds of thousands of famous people (nobles, artists, scientists etc.). In a similar vein, David de la Croix and his co-author Matthias Doepke contributed to the development of a unified framework encompassing fertility, education, inequality and growth. Here, the link involves economic inequality: wealth and education entail lower fertility and more spending on education, thereby deepening inequality; but an increase in inequality lowers average education, hence growth; taking the model to data reveals that differential fertility accounts for most of the empirical relationship between inequality and growth: it implies that neglecting fertility behavior in analyzing the growth-inequality nexus can be strongly misleading. The kind of work mentioned here has implications for policy decisions, definitely with respect to development, but also with respect to education, pensions or migration in developed countries. Some of these implications have been formulated in policy briefs accessible to the general public and politicians. Further work by David de la Croix includes a study of childlessness, where, together with Thomas Baudin and Paula Gobbi, he lists a series of causes of childlessness (natural, poverty driven, opportunity driven) and proposes a methodology to identify their respective importance based on a structural model. Policy implications of this theory are non negligible, in particular when considering that avoidable involuntary childlessness reduces the capability set of poor people. With Fabio Mariani, de la Croix is interested in understanding the economic determinants of changes in marriage laws in the very long run. Changes in income level and in its distribution are key to understand the switch from polygyny to strict monogamy that happened during the Urban Revolution in Europe. Later on, from the 19th century onward, he rise of income per person triggered the adoption of \\"Serial monogamy\\" laws, allowing for divorce and remarriage. A generalization of this theory for the rest of the world is still needed. A constant theme in David de la Croix publications is the role played by institutions for economic growth and development. ‚ÄúInstitutions‚Äù is a very general term, referring to human-made organizations, laws and practices such as religion and family structures, among others. A representative publication, in collaboration with Matthias Doepke and Joel Mokyr, appeared in 2018 in the Quarterly Journal of Economics and deals with the historical role of apprenticeship institutions. Based on qualitative evidence and a new theory of pre-industrial technological progress, the three authors show that apprenticeship institutions were crucial to the economic rise of the West. Different from family- or clan-based institutions that were prevalent in the rest of the World, apprenticeship (as framed by the guild systems in Medieval Europe) allowed new techniques and innovations to spread rapidly across the continent thanks to master-apprentice interactions, without being constrained by family lines.  Other scientific activities  David de la Croix is the instigator and editor-in-chief of the Journal of Demographic Economics (JODE). The objective of JODE is to promote research in the field of study that lies at the intersection of economics and demography. An analysis of demographic change may benefit from an understanding of economic incentives, which are in turn influenced by demographic changes and trends.  Books published  In 2002, he published with Philippe Michel a treatise on overlapping generations models as a tool to study economic growth, dynamics and policy. In 2012, his book on fertility, education, growth and sustainability studies the consequences for macroeconomic outcomes, such as income inequality and growth, of individual fertility choices.

As per the complaint filed in the court of the Metropolitan Magistrate, Associated Journals Limited (AJL) took an interest-free loan of from Indian National Congress. It is alleged that the loan was not repaid. A closely held company, Young Indian, was incorporated in November 2010 with a capital of and it acquired almost all the shareholding of AJL and all its properties (alleged to be worth ). Swamy alleged criminal misappropriation by both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. The courts have determined that a prima facie case has been established in the matter. In a big blow to the Gandhis, the Enforcement Directorate permanently attached properties worth Rs.64 crore in the National Herald Case in May 2019. Associated Journals Limited Associated Journals Limited (AJL) is an unlisted public company limited by shares, incorporated on 20 November 1937, with its registered office at Herald House, 5-A, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi. It was the brainchild of Jawaharlal Nehru but it was never his personal property as it was started with the support of about 5,000 freedom fighters who became shareholders of AJL. The company's capital was divided into 2,000 preferential shares worth each and 30,000 ordinary (equity) shares worth each. Apart from Nehru, AJL's Memorandum of Association was signed by stalwarts such as Purushottam Das Tandon, Acharya Narendra Dev, Kailash Nath Katju, Rafi Ahmad Kidwai, Krishna Dutt Paliwal and Govind Ballabh Pant. The company did not belong to any particular person, nor did it want to be associated with any business except news. AJL had 1,057 shareholders as of 29 September 2010 as per the annual return filed by the company with the Registrar of Companies. Motilal Vora has been the chairman and managing director of AJL since 22 March 2002. The company had incurred losses before its holdings were transferred to Young India in 2011. AJL published the National Herald newspaper in English, Qaumi Awaz in Urdu and Navjeevan in Hindi until 2008. AJL also owns real estate property in various cities including New Delhi, Lucknow, Bhopal, Mumbai, Indore, Patna and Panchkula. The value of the real estate owned by AJL is estimated to be at . The properties of AJL include Herald House, a six-storey building with around 10,000 sq metre office space. On 21 January 2016 the AJL in its meeting in Lucknow decided to relaunch the three dailies, National Herald and its sister publications, Quami Awaz and Navjivan. =Allegations by other shareholders of usurpation of their shares= After the Delhi High Court dismissed the appeal of Sonia Gandhi and others against the summons issued by the trial court, many shareholders of AJL alleged that no notice was served on them by AJL for any meeting of the shareholders and that the shares held by their fathers have been transferred by AJL to Young Indian fraudulently without their consent in December 2010. These shareholders include prominent individuals such as former law minister Shanti Bhushan and former chief justice of Allahabad and Madras High Courts Markandey Katju. Young Indian Young Indian is a private company limited by guarantee, incorporated on 23 November 2010 with a capital of and with its registered office at 5A, Herald House, Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, Delhi. On 13 December 2010, Rahul Gandhi was appointed director of Young Indian while Sonia Gandhi joined the board of directors on 22 January 2011. Of the company's shares, 76 percent are jointly held by Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, and the remaining 24 percent are held by Congress leaders Motilal Vora and Oscar Fernandes (12 percent each). It is described by Rahul Gandhi's office as a \\"not-for-profit company\\" which does have commercial operations. Case On 1 November 2012, Subramanian Swamy filed a private complaint in a court in Delhi alleging that both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have committed fraud and land grabbing worth by acquiring a publicly limited company called Associated Journals Limited (AJL) through their owned private company, Young Indian. He also claimed that, through this fraud, they had got the publication rights of the National Herald and Qaumi Awaz newspapers, with real estate properties in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. He alleged that the acquired properties were given by the government only for the purposes of publishing newspapers, but were used for running a passport office with rental income amounting to millions of rupees. His complaint in the court further alleges that, on 26 February 2011, AJL approved the transfer of an unsecured loan of from the All India Congress Committee at zero interest with all ninety million (9 crore) of the company's shares of each to Young Indian. Swamy argued that it is illegal for a political party to lend money for commercial purposes as per Section 29A to C of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and Section 13A of Income-tax Act, 1961, and demanded investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the de-recognition of the Indian National Congress party for using public money. On 2 November 2012, the party responded that the loan was given only for reviving the National Herald newspaper with no commercial interest. The hearing of the criminal proceedings case was taken up by the magistrate on various dates while the defendants opposed the petition and asked the magistrate to dismiss it. The court finally observed that prima facie evidence against all the accused was found. The court issued summons to the defendants to appear in the court to defend themselves against all the allegations made in Swamy's complaint. On 26 June 2014, Metropolitan Magistrate Ms. Gomati Manocha summoned Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey and Sam_Pitroda to appear in the court on 7 August 2014. She said that according to the evidence so far, \\"it appears that YIL was in fact created as a sham or a cloak to convert public money to personal use\\" to acquire control over worth of AJL assets. The court noted that all accused persons had allegedly acted \\"in consortium with each other to achieve the said nefarious purpose/design\\". Appeal in Delhi High Court and Supreme Court The defendants appealed in the Delhi High Court against the summons issued by the magistrate. On 1 August 2014, Swamy was served notice to file reply in the High Court. On 28 August 2014, the metropolitan court fixed 9 December 2014 for the next hearing of the case. On 12 January 2015, the judge of the Delhi High Court recused himself from hearing the case and directed that the petitions be directed before an appropriate bench. On 27 January 2015, the Supreme Court of India directed Swamy to make a case for speedy trial in the Delhi High Court which was hearing the appeal of Sonia Gandhi and others against the summons issued to them by the trial court. On plea by Sonia Gandhi and others, defendants requested that the Chief Justice reassign the case to Justice Sunil Gaur, who had recused himself earlier. On 1 August 2014, the Enforcement Directorate initiated a probe to discover if there was any money laundering in the case. On 18 September 2015, it was reported that the Enforcement Directorate had reopened the investigation. On 7 December 2015, the Delhi High Court dismissed the appeals of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and five others which included Motilal Vora, Oscar Fernandes, Suman Dubey and Sam Pitroda, and ordered them to appear in person before the trial court on 9 December. The Delhi High Court said in its 7 December 2015 judgment noted \\"criminal intent.\\" On 12 February 2016 the Supreme Court granted exemption to all the five accused in the case from personal appearances while refusing to quash proceedings against them. Later on 12 July 2016 the Delhi High Court set aside the trial court judgement allowing examination of balance sheets and other documents of Congress party and other two companies, the AJL and Young Indian. The next hearing in the court is scheduled on 20 August.  Trial in the magistrate's court On 7 December 2015, the Delhi High Court ordered Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and five others to appear in person before the trial court on 9 December. They did not appear in the court and, on their lawyers' request, the trial court ordered them to appear before him in person on 19 December. He disallowed their request for exemption from personal appearance. On 19 December 2015 the Patiala House court granted bail to all but one and ordered them to appear in the court on the date of next hearing 20 February 2016. On 11 March 2016 the trial court allowed, after hearing Swamy's plea to examine balance sheets of INC, AJL and Young Indian from 2010 to 2013, which was later overturned by the Delhi High Court. On 26 May 2018 Subramanian Swamy's application to the trial court seeking a directive for the defendants to verify material filed by Swamy in the National Herald case was denied.  Current status of the case The Supreme Court allowed the income-tax department to reassess the 2011‚Äì12 tax filings of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, even as the Congress leaders await a court verdict on the legality of I-T notices to them. The top court, however, restrained the department from taking any action against the Congress president and his mother until January 8, 2019, which was the next date of hearing. In a big blow to the Gandhis, the Enforcement Directorate permanently attached properties worth Rs.64 crore in the National Herald Case in May 2019.

The company entered into a strategic partnership with Groupon in 2014 as well as PayPal and the Payout Express product was introduced. The 10 million transactions mark was reached and the risk capital firm Bridgepoint Capital (BDC) invested ‚Ç¨23 million to gain a minority stake. The arrival of Pay N Play epitomises Trustly‚Äôs mission to make online payments fast, simple and secure, transforming the way gamblers pay and play at online gambling from 2016. The Swedish FinTech company ranked #242 on the publication's first ‚ÄòFT 1000: Europe‚Äôs Fastest Growing Companies‚Äô list in 2017 based on its 3-year growth in revenue and staff. In March 2018, the private equity fund Nordic Capital bought a majority stake, some 70 percent of the existing shares, in Trustly. Ahead of the deal the company reportedly got valued at roughly ‚Ç¨700 million. In June 2019, Trustly merged with Silicon Valley-based online banking payments leader PayWithMyBank. The merger enables merchants with a global footprint to accept online banking payments from European and US consumers.  Criticism  Trustly faced criticism in 2013 from a competing bank when they used client information to log into the client's Internet banking. The bank claimed that Trustly had gained access not only to the information required for performing the payment but also to information related to, for example, the client's mutual funds and shareholdings and therefore, banking confidentiality had been compromised. The controversy has resurfaced in 2016 in Poland when PayPal switched to Trustly and a number of information security related websites and banks pointed out that the Trustly's practice is inconsistent with PayPal's own guidance to avoid revealing the credentials to third parties. Trustly defended itself by saying that the company sets out a clear agreement for what information the company may access for performing payments and establishing identity, in the same way as banks. Like the banks, Trustly is under the supervision of the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority as a licensed Payment Institute.

The series began in 2013 and is still running through the present. The story takes place in a dark, steampunk world of 1893 London, where a masked vigilante leads an underground resistance in an ongoing fight against a tyrannical regime, which has their sights set on world domination.  Story  Archangel is a show built around characters. Even though the episodes take place in an alternate, steampunk realm, the stories still concentrate around human adventures. The loss of freedom, the strength of family, the battle against evil and immeasurable strength people can muster, when all else seems hopeless, are but a few of the obstacles the characters face. = Episode I - Ascension = Episode I is a back story. It began life as an advertising effort to promote a line of steampunk clothes and accessories from a company called Museum Replicas Limited. However, writer/director David Di Pietro felt that it would be more exciting to develop a \\"world\\" in which these pieces existed. So, the germ of Archangel was born. This first episode, entitled Ascension tells the brief background of Brenden Winter and how he faked his own death, in order to save the ones he loves from becoming involved in his fight for freedom. The production was shot in HD in Conyers, GA for a few thousand dollars. However, the excitement and buzz about this little video created enough of a stir, that a second episode was planned, with a more \\"realistic\\" budget in place.

It is located at an altitude of 214 meters (702 feet) above sea level and within 569 kilometers (353 miles) south-west of the Moroccan capital Rabat. It is characterized by abundant citrus groves and other plantations, as well as being a strategic location on the highway that links Taroudannt, the western and southern parts and the region's capital city, Agadir. Ain el Madiour is the administrative headquarters of the Greater Machraa El Ain's commune.

The High Atlas mountains are located to the south and southeast of the town, and supply runoff from melted ice and precipitation that descends to the wadis and to the ocean. This water replenishes the bulk of the groundwater in the area and enables agricultural production. http://travelingluck.com/Africa/Morocco/Souss-Massa- Dr%C3%A2a/_2560865_A%C3%AFn+el+Mediour.html Temperatures The climate in the region belongs to the continental climate, which is characterized by high temperatures and drought in the summer. The temperature reaches its peak in July and August, where more than 30 degrees Celsius on average reaching up to 45 degrees Celsius, which sometimes leads to dust storms when a cold air with moisture coming from Agadir in the west collides with the dry hot air of the semi desert region. During the winter months the temperature drops especially in December and January where a record of less than has been recorded. Precipitation of rain occurs in the winter season, especially in the month of December where it reaches to more than 60 millimeters (2.6 inches). February and March are also rainy months. Rainfall is always brief and rapid, whereas abundant water from the mountains flows to the gullies and valleys causes flooding on desiccated land. There is no rain in the summer season. The town's geographical location near the Atlas Mountain ranges promotes moist warm wind blowing from Sous River basin and leads to the formation of a layer of ground fog in the morning, which gradually disappear during the day hours followed by bright sunlight. Economy Onion's fields at Ain el Madiour Agriculture is the main economic sector in Ain el Madiour, and a large part of the population works meeting domestic demand and exporting surplus products to neighboring regions. The products consist of agricultural crops, particularly vegetables and citrus fruits. The town boasts many productive farms and estates where a large part of the local population works. Others work in the local market or in more specialised trades, especially in craft production, construction and beekeeping. There is no industry in the village. There is a small grinding mill. Local weekly open-air markets, the so-called souk exist in the vicinity. One is a \\"Sunday Market\\" held in Taroudannt city and another, \\"Saturday market¬ª in El Guerdane.

The following list provides an overview of the most famous basic income pilots, including projects which have not been launched yet but have been already approved by the respective political bodies or for the negotiations are in process.  Northern America  = Pilots in United States in the 1960s and 1970s = Beginning in the end of 1960s, there were four basic income experiments conducted in the United States, all in the form of NITs. As Alicia H. Munnell, who was examining the experiments in Indiana, Seattle and Denver explains,http://www.bostonfed.org/economic/conf/conf30/conf30a.pdf a moderate reduction in work effort (17% among women, 7% among men) has been found by the American economist Gary Burtless. Munnell also mentions that the money people had received was not squandered on frivolous products such as drugs and luxury goods. In addition, there has been an increase in school attendance. However Jodie Allen remarked that work disincentive effects were large enough to suggest that as much as 50 to 60 percent of the transfers paid to two-parent families under NIT might go to replace lost earnings. . Allen mentions that the researchers ‚Äòalso found an unexpected result: instead of promoting family stability (the presumed result of extending benefits to two-parent working families on an equal basis), the NITs seemed to increase family breakup‚Äô. This was later determined to be a statistical error. See No noticeable improvements to health and the overall well-being were discovered and the effect on home-ownership rates was found to be negligible as well. = Mincome in Manitoba = A similar field experiment of the Canadian Guaranteed Annual Income (GAI), known as Mincome, took place in Dauphin, Manitoba between 1974 and 1979. According to a research into the effects of Mincome on population health, conducted by a University of Manitoba researcher Evelyn Forget in 2011, the experiment has resulted in significant reduction in hospitalization, specifically in case of mental health diagnoses. Among all the people, only two key groups were found to be discouraged from working by the Mincome project ‚Äì new mothers and teenaged boys, who, instead of entering the workforce at an early age, decided to study until grade 12, increasing the proportion of students who graduate high school. = Native American casinos and tribal profit sharing = A longitudinal study of 1,420 low income children in rural North Carolina designed to observe their mental condition had the unintended result of also measuring the effect of an unconditional cash transfer on a subset of this group. The Great Smoky Mountains Study of Youth has found that a quarter of the families belonging to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians have experienced a surge in annual income due to a newly built casino as during this study, a portion of profits of this casino were unconditionally distributed to all tribal members on a semi-annual basis. Key findings of this study include lower instances of behavioural and emotional disorders among the children and improved relationship between children and their parents, as well as reduction in parental alcohol consumption. = Y Combinator = In May 2016, Y Combinator, an American company with the aim of providing seed funding for start-up companies, announced that its non-profit arm YC Research would perform a five-year unconditional basic income study, which resembles the experiments carried out in the 1960s and 1970s, in Oakland, California. The project was delayed by institutional review board approval at Stanford University and the University of Michigan, and work with governments to ensure recipients would not lose benefits they were already receiving. The project gave six people from Oakland $1500 per month in an initial feasibility study. Instead of the previous plan of giving 100 families $1,500 per month, by mid-2018 YC Research was hoping to get 30 to 40 people from Oakland to participate in a $50 per month trial to refine the logistics of distribution and retention of the $50 per month control group. It was planning to run three- and five-year trials in two states, not including Oakland, involving 1,000 participants randomly assigned to $1,500 per month and 2,000 randomly assigned to the $50 per month control group. The full study is expected to cost $60 million, and YC Research is waiting for fundraising to complete before starting the study. = Ontario Basic Income Pilot Project = In Ontario, three-year basic income projects were launched in three regions from late spring to fall 2017. The participants of the project were randomly selected among resident of the regions aged 18‚Äì64, who were living on low income. The purpose of the experiment was to tackle poverty, providing people with income security while, at the same time, not discouraging them from entering the labour force. Furthermore, as poverty is believed to be one of the biggest determinants of health, the project is believed to improve health condition, which could, in turn, reduce health-care costs for the government. The pilot project was cancelled on July 31, 2018 by the newly elected Progressive Conservative government under Ontario Premier Doug Ford, with his Minister of Children, Community and Social Services Lisa MacLeod stating simply it was 'unsustainable' without citing data. Payments to participants continued until March 2019. = Stockton, California = In a pilot project in Stockton, California which began in February 2019, 125 residents of Stockton, California who were living at or below the median income line (around $46,000 annually) were given $500 monthly stipends, distributed through the mail in the form of debit cards, for eight months. Results evaluated in October found that most participants had been using their stipends to buy groceries and pay their bills. Around 43% of participants had a full or part-time job, only 2% were unemployed and not actively seeking work.  Africa = Namibia = In 2008, the Namibian Basic Income Grant Coalition conducted a two-year basic income pilot in the Otjivero - Omitara settlement, providing $100 per month to every person under the age of 60. The treatment group consisted of around 1,000 people, and a combination of panel and case studies was used to measure outcomes. After the study ended at the end of 2009, a monthly allowance of $80 was paid to all participants until March 2012. In 2013, due to extreme drought conditions, the Evangelical Lutheran church in Namibia provided a monthly cash grant of $100 to 6,000 individuals in four communities, modeled after the initial pilot program, from September 2013 to May 2014. In June 2014, the program restarted thanks to support from the Waldensian Church in Italy, lasting until June 2015. =Uganda= A program in Uganda randomly awarded an unsupervised grants of $382 to 535 young applicants aged 15‚Äì35. The results showed that \\"the program increases business assets by 57%, work hours by 17%, and earnings by 38%\\". In addition, many of those who participated in the project have also started their own enterprises, creating job opportunities for others. In January 2017, another pilot study, designed for two years, was launched by the charitable organization Eight in an undisclosed village consisting of 50 households. The experiment, which is being recorded in a documentary, aims to evaluate the effects of basic income in four areas: education participation of girls and women, access to healthcare, engagement in democratic institutions and local economic development. The amount of income distributed to the village residents per month is $18.25 for adults and $9.13 for children. = GiveDirectly in Kenya= GiveDirectly, one of the highest ranking charities according to GiveWell, is running the world‚Äôs largest and longest-term experiment to date studying the effects of a Universal Basic Income. The project has a budget of and started in 2016. In total, 20,000 recipients from 195 rural villages are receiving a universal basic income for a period of two or twelve years, depending on the study group they belong to. In addition, 100 villages are also part of the study as a control group.  Asia  = Madhya Pradesh, India = The basic income project in Madhya Pradesh, India, which started in 2010, involves 20 villages. While the villagers in eight of those got basic income, the others serve as control groups. According to the first communication of the pilot projects, positive results were found.\\"INDIA: Basic Income Pilot Project Finds Positive Results,\\" Basic Income News, BIEN (22 September 2012). Villages spent more on food and healthcare, children's school performance improved in 68% of families, time spent in school as well as personal savings nearly tripled and new business start-ups doubled. The study has also found an increase both in economic activity and in savings, an improvement in housing and sanitation, improved nutrition, less food poverty, improved health and schooling, greater inclusion of the disabled in society and a lack of frivolous spending.http://unicef.in/Uploads/Publications/Resources/pub_doc83.pdf Latin America The family of Selma Ferreira was the first recipient of Bolsa Escola, a precursor to Bolsa Fam√≠lia enacted by governor Cristovam Buarque of the Federal District in 1995. = Bolsa Familia = Bolsa Familia is a Brazilian federal anti-poverty program with strong resemblance of basic income. It consists of a cash grant, which is given to families below a certain income level, provided they meet pre-arranged conditions such as overseeing their children's school attendance. As of March 2020, the program covers 13.8 million families, and pays an average of $34 per month, in a country where the minimum wage is $190 per month. Other similar programs are implemented in several Latin American countries, including the Oportunidades programme in Mexico. = Quatinga Velho = Quatinga Velho is a Brazilian village in the Quatinga district of the Mogi das Cruzes municipality, which is becoming well-known for its basic income project launched in 2008 and organized by the non-profit organization ReCivitas. The funding has been entirely based on private donations so far. In June 2011, 83 villagers were given 30 Brazilian reals per person each month. The organization's objective is to eventually grant the basic income to all villagers and to get similar projects going in other villages as well, both in and outside Brazil. The organizers are currently building a social bank, so that the basic income can be financed through investments rather than donations in the future. The idea is that the bank will operate as an investment bank, but the profit will be allocated to basic income instead of a dividend to shareholders and managers.  Europe  = Netherlands = Experiments with basic income in the Netherlands are experiments with social assistance (more than basic income) as they focus on current welfare claimants. The most important experiment is called 'Weten wat werkt' (Knowing What Works) and is a cooperation between Utrecht University and the City of Utrecht, studying \\"alternative approach to deliver social assistance\\". During the experiment, social assistance claimants are randomly divided into four groups, each of which will receive payments under different conditions. The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of different or fewer rules on claimants of social assistance. The experiment was supposed to be launched on 1 May 2017, but approval by the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment was delayed. The experiment started in June 2018 and will conclude in October 2019. = Finland = A nationwide, two- year pilot scheme was launched in Finland on 1 January 2017. In total, 2,000 participants, who were randomly selected among those receiving unemployment benefits and aged 25‚Äì58, were entitled to an unconditional income of per month, even if they found work during the two year period. The experiment tests whether the implementation of basic universal income could help provide welfare more in line with the changing nature of work, reduce the cost and complexity of the benefits system and provide citizens with greater incentive to find work. Addressing issues caused by automation, long-term unemployment and lower wages are part of a larger social context for the experiment. As planned, the experiment ended at the end of 2018, and the government of Finland has decided not to continue the experiment while the results of the study are analyzed. Preliminary results were released in 2019. While levels of employment did not change, it did report that those involved showed \\"fewer stress symptoms, fewer difficulties concentrating and fewer health problems than the control group. They were also more confident in their future and in their ability to influence societal issues.\\" The full results of the study will come in 2020, after researchers have had time to analyse all the collected data. = Italy = In June 2016, the mayor of an Italian coastal city of Livorno Filippo Nogarin launched a conditional minimum income project for a period of six months, granting 100 of the poorest families in the city a monthly sum of to cover their basic costs such as rent and food. The project is not an unconditional basic income. In January 2017, the scope of the project was extended to include another 100 families. Even though the granted sum is not as high as in case of Finland or other countries, it constitutes a huge relief for the families which are otherwise not protected at all due to the lack of unemployment benefits and minimum wage laws in Italy. The project has already inspired other Italian cities, such as Ragusa and Naples, to consider launching similar schemes as well. In Italy, other projects of minimum guaranteed income had already been realized, much more advanced both for the amount of money and for the purposes of the Livorno project. One of these had been implemented in the Lazio Region thanks to the introduction of a law (4/2009) which in 2010 envisaged about 600 euros per month for the unemployed, particularly for women. About 10,000 people had participated in this first phase of starting the law for the minimum guaranteed income. The subsequent regional government has not funded the law again.https://www.bin- italia.org/UP/pubb/QR(1).pdf = Scotland = In 2018, the Scottish Government agreed to provide to assess the feasibility of a basic income pilot in four areas: Glasgow, Edinburgh and the regions of Fife and North Ayrshire. The feasibility study will be completed in September 2019, and the government will then decide how best to proceed with a pilot in the four areas. The Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce has also produced a report examining some of the benefits and challenges of a basic income system in the region of Fife. = France = In France, 13 local departments have expressed the wish to experiment basic income in their territories. However such experiments would require the approval of the French government. = Spain = In Spain, the ingreso m√≠nimo vital is an economic benefit guaranteed by the Social security in Spain in its modality no contributory. The IMV is defined as a \\"subjective right\\" and is intended to prevent poverty and social exclusion of people who live alone or integrated in a coexistence unit, when they are in a situation of vulnerability due to lack of sufficient financial resources to cover their basic needs. The benefit, which is not fixed and varies depending on various factors, ranges between and . = Germany = In August 2020, a project in Germany started that gives a monthly basic income to 120 citizens, which will last three years and be compared against 1,380 people who do not receive basic income.

He was born in Los Angeles CA in 1941 to George T. Goggin, a successful Hollywood lawyer.Obituary of George T. Goggin. Los Angeles Times (23 August 1972). pg 35\\"Democrats 'Hungry for Good Government?' Who is Terry Goggin\\". The San Bernardino County Sun (2 June 1974) p. D-9 and Mary Adelaide Hare, a writer and homemaker and personal assistant to California Oil Barron Edward L. Doheny. He served in the California State Assembly as a Democrat from 1974 to 1985.http://www.joincalifornia.com/candidate/5814 After leaving State government he attended to his business interests and the practice of law.  Early life and education  Goggin lived with his family in Glendale, California from 1941 to 1955. He attended Incarnation Catholic School in Glendale California. Thereafter, he attended Villanova Preparatory School in Ojai California. In 1959 Goggin left Glendale for Georgetown University, College of Arts and Sciences where he was elected president of the 160-year- old Philodemic Debating Society, with a seat on the Student Council. He was also a Cadet Captain in the school‚Äôs ROTC. In 1963, he was admitted to The University of Southern California, Gould School of Law. While there he was accepted into the Southern California Law Review and published two separate articles on the difficulty of obtaining a fair trial in the midst of massive negative publicity. In 1965 and 1966, while finishing law school, Goggin conducted legal research in the California Attorney General‚Äôs Office in the Consumer Fraud and Anti Trust Division. Career =Military service = After graduating from Georgetown he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army. He trained at the Infantry Officer School and the Airborne School at Fort Benning Georgia. Upon completing training, he joined the faculty at the US Military Academy at West Point, NY as an instructor and debate coach. From 1967 through 1970 he taught history and government. He also developed a Seminar in Public Policy. The seminar focused on Race, Environment, and Central Cities; one of the first courses in the country to offer classes in current economic and social problems using a case method approach. Based on the seminar, along with Mick Seidel, his co-author, he published Politics American Style: Race, Environment, and Central Cities (Prentice-Hall, 1972). In his last year, he was appointed an Assistant Professor. While at West Point, in the summer of 1969, he was assigned to the White House as a Special Consultant to the White House Urban Affairs Council.https://iop.harvard.edu/fellows/terrence-p-goggin He, along with another colleague from West Point, conducted a field study on the political use of the food stamp and donated food programs in Mississippi, Missouri, California and New York which formed the basis for a Memorandum to the President on the Misuse of the Food Assistance Programs.Hearings, Reports and Prints of the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs: Parts 1-4 United States Congress Senate. Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs January 1, 1970 pp. 819-873 After that, he left the military, returned to California, and began the practice of law with his father in the law firm of Goggin, Goggin, and Commons in Los Angeles California. =Public life= Goggin ran for Congress in 1972 in the newly created 38th Congressional District. He lost the primary to George Brown,(D. Colton) who then offered him his top staff position as Administrative Assistant (now termed Chief of Staff) where he represented the Congressman, as his Attorney, in the fight to block the Federal Trade Commission from granting Natural Gas Companies a 73% rate hike. In 1974, Goggin won election to the California Assembly with 72% of the vote. In his first term, he became a lead co-author of the Nuclear Energy Laws banning new nuclear power plants until the safety of both the plants and the recycling and storage of plutonium fuel could be resolved.California Public Resources Code Sec. 25000 ‚Äî 25968. These laws were later challenged by the California utilities, who claimed that they were by Federal Law and therefore unconstitutional. In 1982 the US Supreme Court upheld their constitutionality.Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. State Energy Resources Conservation & Development Commission, 461 U.S. 190 (1983) In 1976 he was appointed Chairman of the Assembly Subcommittee on Energy and investigated the question of whether and where to site Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plants. After concluding a three-month investigation in Goggin‚Äôs subcommittee, the legislature passed a bill, LNG Terminal Act of 1977 (S.B.1081), restricting LNG facilities to nonpopulated areas. Because of pricing issues, they also mandated that ratepayer funds could not be used until the price of LNG became competitive with other energy options and certified as such by the PUC. Such certification had not occurred in the 40 years since the passage of this legislation. https://www.energy.ca.gov/data-reports/california-power- generation-and-power-sources/liquefied-natural- gas#:~:text=California%20gets%20about%2010%20percent,LNG%20terminals%20along%20the%20coast. In 1977, Coggin was invited to teach in the Fall Term, at Harvard University as a Kennedy Fellow at the Kennedy Institute of Politics. He led a Seminar on the \\"Politics of Nuclear Power\\" and how peaceful protests and lobbying can be effective in defeating entrenched corporate power.https://iop.harvard.edu/sites/default/files_new/Proceedings/1977-78%20to%201978-79.pdf. pg.74. In 1978 He was appointed Chairman of the Ways and Means Resources Subcommittee overseeing the then $3 Billion Dollar Budget for the Transportation and a Resources Agencies including the State Parks Department. While he was Chairman the subcommittee forced the State Parks Department to refocus on much needed urban parks and funded the most expensive park acquisition up to that time: $30 million dollars for 5 miles of coastal plain and cliffs restored to their original flora and fauna. The Chrystal Cove State Park, just north of Laguna Beach in urban Orange County, preserved from high rise development forever a unique part of the urban southern coast.https://books.google.com/books?id=WBR3JZn819EC&pg;=PA2806&lpg;=PA2806&dq;=crystal+cove+state+park+aguisition&source;=bl&ots;=PR9uQjblvH. In 1981, after a bitter and divisive Speakership fight, the new Speaker Willie Brown appointed him Chairman of the Criminal Justice Committee. https://books.google.com/books?id=zh49CGAFqZgC&pg;=PA211&lpg;=PA211&dq;=willie+brown+appoints+terry+goggin+chairman+of+the+criminal+justice+committee&source;=bl&ots;=HWp5ayoTM5&sig;=ACfU3U3RPdPGJCIRmi_PhvCv1g--. As Chairman he worked with the Mothers Against Drunk Drivers to create the first DUI bill that required jail time for repeat drunk drivers and long term suspended licenses. Due to reports of mentally disordered sex offenders and not guilty by reason of insanity offenders escaping from state mental hospitals at which they were confined and creating havoc in the neighboring communities,Mental Hospital Escapees Bill OK‚Äôd By Committee, Santa Crus Sentinel March 16, 1982, pg. 5. at Chairman Goggin‚Äôs urging, the legislature unanimously passed the legislation mandating that the California Department of Corrections take over security control of these state hospitals from the State Department of Mental Health. This action was vehemently opposed by the police unions who represented the fired state hospital security guards. In 1984, due in part, to the strong and often harsh opposition of the energy companies and the police unions for his legislation, Goggin was defeated in an extremely close race in the Democratic primary in 1984. Goggin: Too Often To The Political Well, The San Bernardino Sun, June 7, 1984, pg.1. = Real estate development and coffee restaurant business = From 1986 to 1989 he was a successful subdivision developer in southern California. Among his developments were Deerfield Homes, Bellflower California (33 homes) and Cottrell Ranch, La Puente California (78 homes) In December 1980, Goggin was part of an investment group that formed the White Pine Company and planned to purchase the Hotel Nevada and Gambling Hall in Ely, Nevada. A 30 percent interest in the company would be held by the White Pine Trust, a fund that would be established by Goggin, with his wife Jill and three children as the beneficiaries, while another member of the company would act as the trustee of Goggin's trust. Plans to purchase the Hotel Nevada were delayed by the Nevada Gaming Control Board, which had concerns about Goggin's trust fund. Because of the trust, Goggin would seemingly not benefit directly from the hotel. However, Control Board members requested that Goggin still participate in a suitability hearing. One Board member said that Goggin's trust seemed like an attempt to \\"cover something up.\\" Goggin denied that he was using the trust fund to obscure his investment in the Hotel Nevada. The sale was ultimately approved by the Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission later that month. In November 2018, a federal grand jury in Oakland, California indicted Goggin for allegedly defrauding investors in a chain of Peet's Coffee stands located inside BART stations and using the funds for personal expenses. He was charged with four counts of wire fraud and nine counts of money-laundering.  Personal life  In 1963 Goggin married Jill Anne Tronvig, a graduate of Scripps College Claremont and a teacher who was born in Los Angeles California. The marriage lasted from 1963 to 1984. The Goggin's together had three sons.

Lee studied the growth of fish using the growth rings on their scales. In 1920, she discovered the effect now known as the 'Lee phenomenon' or 'Rosa Lee Phenomenon', and her results are still cited in modern publications. Early years Lee was born in Conwy, Caernarvonshire in 1884. Her father, George Henry Payne Lee was a civil servant, born in Exeter, Devon. Her mother was Maria Agnes, born in St Pancras, London. In 1894, her father worked in Conwy as a postal telegraph inspector. Rosa had two older brothers (Harold and Albert) and two older sisters (Amy and Florence). She graduated from Bangor University in 1904 with a BA in mathematics (Class: II), its first woman graduate in mathematics. Working life Lee was employed by the Marine Biological Association (MBA) in their laboratory at Lowestoft, the first woman scientist to be employed by the MBA. Lee became the first woman to work as a government fishery scientist when she was employed as an assistant naturalist in 1905. In 1910, all of the staff at Lowestoft were transferred to the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and during the original transfer, Lee was not offered a job. The board reportedly stated that they 'did not employ women scientists'. However, after protests from the MBA and Garstang, she was allowed to start work as a civil servant. She continued her research and stayed on with the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries in London until 1919. She worked at the office in Delahay Street, Westminster. In the 1911 census she was recorded as living in London with her sister, Amy Lee at 2 Avenue House, St Johns Wood, London. The street is now renamed Allison Street but Avenue House still exists. Rosa Lee married Thomas Lewis Williams in 1917, but had to leave the Civil Service in 1919 as the marriage bar rules at the time did not allow married women to continue in employment Rosa and Thomas subsequently moved to Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, where Rosa stayed, until after her husbands death in 1946. Rosa herself died in Greenwich (London) in 1976, aged 92. Scientific work Lee published a number of scientific papers in her working life, including an article that appeared in Nature in 1920. However, her most cited work is not this more prestigious publication but is a report for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. Rosa Lee phenomemenon Fish scales have growth rings and are used to age fish, in the same way that tree rings can be used to age trees. Fishery scientists try and understand the fish populations by modelling. They need to know how old and how big the fish are and how each ‚Äòcohort‚Äô of the population will grow as it matures. Each catch of fish has fish of different ages, i.e. fish that were born in different years. The size and growth of these fish can be linked to environmental variables. Predicting future stock of fish is necessary for good management and to do this accurate estimates of growth rates and 'length at age' are required. By measuring the rings of a fish its possible to say how long it was for every year of its life. Lee observed that you may get different results for growth rates by 'back calculating' from an older fish, than you would when calculating growth rates from younger fish. This phenomenon occurs when individuals in a population with slower growth rates suffer less mortality when young. The older population is skewed by more slower growing fish, as the faster growing fish died at a younger age. There can be a number of reasons for this, one reason can be selective mortality, e.g. fishing gear that selects for a particular size of fish will catch the larger young fish and the smaller old fish. It can also occur when the sampling is biased. Rosa Lee's work is still relevant today and her paper is frequently cited, however her actual influence is greater than indicated by the number of citations, because some scientific authors simply refer to 'Rosa Lee's phenomenon' rather than correctly citing her publication.

Notes and commentaries. The Works of A.I.Kuprin in 9 volumes. Pravda Publishers. The Ogonyok Library. Moscow, 1964. Vol. 1, pp. 488-489. Synopsis In the actress Golskaya's dressing room between acts three and four of the show, her impresario (and fellow actor) Alexander Petrovich, whom she loves, announces the end of their affair and promises to provide for the child she is expecting. Apart from that, he rebukes her for her allegedly poor performance in the play where, coincidentally, her role is that of a deceived girl, while he plays her seducer. In the final act Golskaya performs with superb power to impress everybody except her unresponsive stage partner. She reaches the ultimately realistic effect by taking real poison in full view of the audience as the curtain falls. Background The story was based on a real life incident, the suicide by poisoning on stage in Kharkov of an aspiring Russian actress, Yevlalya Kadmina, who played that evening the leading role in Vasilisa Melentyeva, a historical drama by Alexander Ostrovsky. This tragedy caused a lively debate in the Russian press. It inspired Ivan Turgenev's novella \\"Clara Milich\\" (1882) and Alexey Suvorin's drama Tatyana Repina, premiered at the Maly in 1889. Kuprin, then a Junker student at the Moscow Third Alexander Military Academy, was an avid theatre-goer. Impressed by this massively popular production he was moved enough by it to write his own version of the story. Publication history Alexander Kuprin approached the poet Liodor Palmin who arranged for the story to be published in the Russian Satirical Leaflet (signed \\"–ê. –ö-rin\\"), on 3 December 1889. The Junkers were forbidden to publish anything without the consent of the Academy's authorities, so, as the identity of the author became known, Kuprin was arrested and spent two days in custody. The circumstances of the publication left a lasting mark on Kuprin's literary output. He re-visited them first in his short story \\"The Firstling\\" (–ü–µ—Ä–≤–µ–Ω–µ—Ü, Pervenets, 1897), changing the names of both the journal and his mentor (the latter, to Ivan Liodorych Venkov), then in the autobiographical novel Junkers (–Æ–Ω–∫–µ—Ä–∞, 1928-1932), and in the story \\"Printer's Ink\\" (–¢–∏–ø–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ—Å–∫–∞—è –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∫–∞, 1929). The story was re- issued for the first time in 1939 when it appeared in the Soviet Literary Contemporary (Literaturny sovremennik) magazine's July and August issues. Later it was included into the Collected Works by A.I. Kuprin in six volumes (Khudozhestvennaya Literatura; first edition, 1957-1958). Assessment According to the Kuprin scholar Nicholas Luker, the story, \\"despite its stilted language and stereotyped characters,\\" has the \\"narrative dynamism typical of the later Kuprin... [T]hough beset by literary clich√©s, its treatment of love and the pain it can bring is deeply sensitive, a quality that would be the hallmark of his best works.\\" References Category:1889 short stories Category:Aleksandr Kuprin ","title":"The Last Debut"},{"id":"48326516","text":"Andreas Stech (September 9, 1635 - January 12, 1697) was a Baroque painter.

The unit helped to defend the vital naval base of Plymouth, and supplied detachments for service in the field in both World Wars. During the North African campaign in World War II, the unit's sappers distinguished themselves in bridging the Nile and clearing minefields during and after El Alamein. Their successors served on the postwar Territorial Army until 1969. Origins The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 led to the creation of many Rifle, Artillery and Engineer Volunteer units composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need.Beckett. One such unit was the 1st Devonshire Engineer Volunteer Corps (EVC) formed at Torquay, with the first officers' commissions dated 28 January 1862.Beckett, Appendix IX.Westlake, pp. 7‚Äì8. The 1st Devonshire EVC was attached for administrative purposes to the 1st (Exeter and South Devon) Devonshire Rifle Volunteer Corps from April 1863 until August 1869, when it joined the 1st Administrative Battalion of Gloucestershire EVCs. With the reorganisation of the Volunteer Force in 1880, the Gloucestershire Admin Bn was consolidated as the 1st Gloucestershire EVC, with the 1st Devon providing E Company at Torquay and F Company at Exeter. The EVC titles were abandoned in 1888, when the units became 'Engineer Volunteers, Royal Engineers', proclaiming their affiliation to the Regular RE, and then simply 'Royal Engineers (Volunteers)' in 1896.Westlake, p. 3. In August 1889, the Devon and Somerset companies were removed from the Gloucestershire battalion and constituted as a separate 1st Devonshire and Somersetshire RE (V), with its HQ at the Priory, Colleton Crescent, Exeter.Monthly Army List.Exeter at The Drill Hall Project.Priory Drill Hall at Historic England. The 1st Devonshire and Somerset RE (V) sent a detachment of one officer and 25 other ranks to assist the regular REs during the Second Boer War in 1900, and a second section the following year.Watson, pp. 42‚Äì43. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) in 1908, the Devon and Somerset Engineers were split to form the Devonshire Fortress Royal Engineers at Plymouth and the divisional engineer companies for the Wessex Division, which were based in Somerset (except for part of the signal company, which remained at Exeter).London Gazette, 14 October 1910 The Devonshire Fortress Engineers was organised as follows:Watson & Rinaldi, p. 12.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 83. * HQ at Mutley Barracks, PlymouthPlymouth at The Drill Hall Project. * No 1 Works Company at the Drill Hall, Rock Road, TorquayTorquay at The Drill Hall Project. * Nos 2 & 3 Works Companies at Exeter * Nos 4 & 5 Electric Lights Companies at Plymouth A new Drill Hall at Lambhay Green, Plymouth, designed in 1913, was completed in 1918.Plymouth at Drill Hall Project.Architectural plans at Drill Hall Project. World War I =Mobilisation= On the outbreak of war in August 1914, the fortress engineers moved to their war stations in the coastal defences, the Devonshire Fortress Engineers coming under the command of South Western Coast Defences HQ at Devonport, Plymouth.Conrad. Shortly afterwards, the men of the TF were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service and WO instructions were issued to form those men who had only signed up for Home Service into reserve or 2nd Line units. The titles of these 2nd Line units were the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. They absorbed most of the recruits that flooded in, and in many cases themselves went on active service later.Becke, Pt 2b, p. 6. In December 1914 the 1/1st Devonshire (Works) Co sailed to Gibraltar to relieve a Regular RE company there. In the Spring of 1915 it was relieved by 1/2nd Devonshire (Works) Co. The 1/1st Devonshire then moved to the Western Front and joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). It served on the Somme in 1916. The 1/2nd Devonshire was in turn relieved by another TF company in November 1916 and embarked again for service with the BEF on 17 March 1917.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 69.'Embarkation Dates', The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 162/7. The 1/4th Dorset (EL) Company was also sent to Gibraltar in April 1915 to replace a Regular company. When the TF companies of the RE received numbers in February 1917, they were assigned as follows:Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 63‚Äì64.RE Museum list of WWI unit war diaries. * 567th (Devon) Army Troops Company ‚Äì formerly 1/1st Devon (Works) Company * 568th (Devon) Army Troops Company ‚Äì formerly 1/2nd Devon (Works) Company * 569th (Devon) Army Troops Company ‚Äì formerly 1/3rd Devon (Works) Company * 570th (Devon) Army Troops Company ‚Äì formerly 2/1st Devon (Works) Company * 571st (Devon) Works Company ‚Äì probably 2/2nd Devon (Works) Company * 572nd (Devon) Works Company ‚Äì formerly 2/3rd Devon (Works) Company * 614th (Devon) Fortress Company ‚Äì formerly 1/4th Devon (Electric Lights) Company =Sinai and Palestine= Details of the service of the Devon companies are sketchy.

At this stage of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) was about to launch the Battle of Beersheba and begin its advance to capture Jerusalem. The three companies served on the vital lines of communications in Egypt and Palestine supporting the EEF for the rest of the war.569th, 570th & 571st (Devon) AT Companies War Diaries, 1917‚Äì19, The National Archives (TNA), Kew file WO 95/4730. =Later war= 567th (Devon) Company was serving with X Corps in June 1917, and Fourth Army, by the time of the Armistice in November 1918. 568th (Devon) Company was still serving with First Army as late as June 1919. 569th, 570th and 5761st (Devon) Companies continued working on the Palestine Lines of Communications after the Armistice, 570th Company serving until at least March 1920. Having spent much if the war working in the UK, 572nd (Devon) Works Company finally embarked to join the BEF on 8 August 1918 to work on aerodrome construction for the Royal Air Force, and remained overseas until at least March 1919. 614th continued doing fortress duties in Gibraltar until it was absorbed into the Regular 33rd Fortress Company RE in 1919.Addison, p. 22.

The remainder of the D&C; (F) RE mobilised in the Plymouth and Falmouth Defences of Southern Command.Watson & Rinaldi, p. 185.Southern Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.

When VIII Corps was formed in Southern Command in June 1940, its engineers (VIII Corps Troops, Royal Engineers, or VIII CTRE) were provided by the Devonshire and Cornwall Fortress Engineers:Watson & Rinaldi, p. 171. * 570th Corps Field Park Company * 571st Army Field Company * 572nd Army Field Company * 573rd Army Field Company However, in February 1941, the companies left VIII Corps and were sent to Egypt, where they became X CTRE when X Corps HQ arrived from England a few months later to join Eighth Army. =Bridging the Nile= On 20 July 1942, when Rommel was driving towards Egypt, General Headquarters (GHQ) ordered the construction of two bridges across the Nile to allow Eighth Army's armour to manoeuvre to the south if the Cairo defences were attacked. The task was assigned to X CTRE under Lt-Col E.N. Bickford. The sites chosen were at Helwan and Wasta, where the widths to be bridged were 2688 feet (820 m) and 2760 feet (840 m) respectively, and the difference between high and low water was about 22 feet (7 m). Pontoons were unavailable, so local feluccas were used to make a bridge of boats. 572nd Field Company took on the bridge at Helwan with the assistance of a Seychelles Pioneer Company, while 571st Field Company with a Mauritius Pioneer Company built the Wasta bridge. 570th Field Park Company was responsible for stores and welding. In the event, Rommel's final drive was halted at the Battle of Alam Halfa, the Cairo defences were not required, and the bridges were dismantled in November.Pakenham-Walsh, p. 364. =Clearing minefields= Sappers demonstrating the new Mark I mine detector in North Africa, August 1942. On 23 October, the Eighth Army under Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery counter- attacked at the Second Battle of El Alamein. For the first phase, the aptly- named Operation Lightfoot, the key was to breach the extensive German minefields during the night to allow the armour formations to pass through and exploit the success of the initial bombardment and infantry assault. For this work the sappers were trained to use the recently arrived Polish mine detector (Mine detector Mark I). X Corps organised a Minefield Task Force for each of its armoured divisions: 571st Field Company was attached to 10th Armoured Division, and both 572nd and 573rd Fd Cos were with 1st Armoured Division, while 570th Fd Park Co remained with X Corps HQ.Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 385‚Äì395.Joslen, pp. 567‚Äì569. The task of clearing lanes through the minefields went according to plan, though delayed by the scale of the minefields and the presence of pockets of enemy resistance that had not been cleared out by the attacking infantry. The southern corridor was under enemy artillery and small- arms fire, and when a truck was set on fire the illumination meant that the sappers were exposed to even more accurate fire. However, the gap was cleared by 06.30 on 24 October, and 10th Armoured passed through. Progress was slower in the northern corridor and 51st (Highland) Division had to put in a fresh attack with massed artillery support at 15.00, after which the sappers were able to clear the way for 1st Armoured to deploy during the second night. The regimental history attributes the relatively light casualties among the mine clearance parties, despite the firefights going on around them, 'to the excellence of the mine-lifting drill and the accuracy with which it was carried out'. By 4 November the German and Italian troops were in full retreat across the desert. =Advance to Tripoli= Churchill on the podium takes the salute at the Tripoli victory parade, 4 February 1943. X CTRE followed Eighth Army's six-month advance across North Africa, repairing roads behind the advancing troops. Between Bouerat and Misourata, the unit dealt with 68 separate demolitions and craters, one involving the construction of a bridge with five 30-foot (10 m) spans. So many casualties were suffered from S-mines hidden among the demolitions that bulldozers were frequently called in.Pakenham-Walsh, pp. 406‚Äì408. Captain Desmond Fitzgerald, a Regular RE officer attached to the TA Devonians of 571st Fd Co for two months from 1 January, recalled that his duties mainly involved clearing mines and booby- traps from captured landing strips before they could be used by the Royal Air Force. The company was attached to 1st Armoured Division at this time.Fitzgerald, pp. 126‚Äì128. When the damaged port of Tripoli was captured in late January 1943, Montgomery said that his \\"main preoccupation was to get the harbour uncorked and ships inside, so as to get a good daily tonnage landed\\" and reduce reliance on the long coast road from Tobruk.Montgomery, p. 156. 571st Army Fd Co was one of the units sent to clear debris and repair the approach roads to the quays, and then begin repairing the Spanish Mole. Despite winter storms, a shallow entrance into the harbour was ready for small craft to enter and unload by 30 January. The next task was to remove Fascist Party emblems and pictures of Benito Mussolini, and erect a special podium in the town square for a victory parade attended by Winston Churchill on 4 February. Fitzgerald recalls that the troops referred to this construction as the \\"oxometer\\" ‚Äì a device for measuring bullshit. =Italy and North West Europe= X CTRE next took part in the Italian campaign of 1943‚Äì5, including the crossing of the Garigliano in January 1944. The four Devon companies left X CTRE in early 1945 when they were sent to join 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe. Here they were redesignated 19th GHQ TRE. The units were demobilised some time after September 1945. Postwar When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the four Devon companies (now termed squadrons, but unusually still retaining the numbers they had borne on and off since 1917) were reformed, comprising 116 Army Engineer Regiment:Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 293‚Äì293.80‚Äì177 TA Rgts RE at British Army 1945 on.337‚Äì575 TA Sqns RE at British Army 1945 on. * 570 Field Park Squadron * 571 Field Squadron * 572 Field Squadron * 573 Field Squadron The regiment had its HQ at Plymouth and derived its seniority from the 1st Devonshire EVC of 1862. It formed part of 26 Engineer Group. 116 Regiment was disbanded in 1950 and its number transferred from the TA to the Supplementary Reserve (later the Army Emergency Reserve). A new 116 (Devon and Cornwall) Engineer Regiment was formed in the TA in 1961, comprising a reformed 571 Field Squadron with 409 (Cornwall) Independent Field Squadron, the latter formed in 1956 by conversion of the 409th (Cornwall) Coast Regiment, Royal Artillery.Litchfield, p. 34. When the TA was converted into the TAVR in 1967, 571 Sqn was reconstituted as B (Devon Fortress Engineers) Squadron in the Devonshire Territorials (Royal Devon Yeomanry/1st Rifle Volunteers). However, the squadron was short-lived, because the TAVR units were reduced to cadre in 1969 and the Devon Fortress Engineers lineage was discontinued.The Devonshire Territorials at Regiments.org. Honorary Colonels The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the unit: * Field Marshal Sir Lintorn Simmons, RE, appointed 14 July 1888. * General Sir Richard Harrison, RE, appointed 20 January 1909.

The impact of 9/11 has extended beyond geopolitics into society and culture in general. Immediate responses to 9/11 included greater focus on home life and time spent with family, higher church attendance, and increased expressions of patriotism such as the flying of American flags. The radio industry responded by removing certain songs from playlists, and the attacks have subsequently been used as background, narrative or thematic elements in film, television, music and literature. Already-running television shows as well as programs developed after 9/11 have reflected post-9/11 cultural concerns. 9/11 conspiracy theories have become social phenomena, despite lack of support from scientists, engineers, and historians. 9/11 has also had a major impact on the religious faith of many individuals; for some it strengthened, to find consolation to cope with the loss of loved ones and overcome their grief; others started to question their faith or lost it entirely, because they could not reconcile it with their view of religion. The culture of the United States succeeding the attacks is noted for heightened security and an increased demand thereof, as well as paranoia and anxiety regarding future terrorist attacks that includes most of the nation. Psychologists have also confirmed that there has been an increased amount of national anxiety in commercial air travel. Due to the significance of the attacks, media coverage was extensive, including disturbing live pictures, and prolonged discourse about the attacks in general, resulting in iconography and greater meaning associated with the event. Don DeLillo called it \\"the defining event of our time\\". The attacks spawned a number of catchphrases, terms, and slogans, many of which continue to be used more than a decade later. Media response Through endless reproductions in mass media and popular culture, the attacks have an important cultural meaning for many people: \\"The attacks percolate as a central theme or historical backdrop in countless works of art, which bear witness to the complexity of 9/11 as historical, political, and media event, and contribute to the negotiation of its cultural meaning.\\" Bauder-Begerow, Irina; Stefanie Sch√§fer. \\"Learning 9/11.\\" Learning 9/11. Ed. Bauder-Begerow, Irina; Stefanie Sch√§fer. Memmingen: Winter Verlag, 2011. Regarding the attacks of 9/11 and Pearl Harbor Arthur G. Neal said: > \\"We create the world through our perceptions of it and seek to maintain area > with world in a manner consistent with our beliefs about it. It is through > such symbolic constructions that we are provided with usable frameworks for > shaping our memories and organizing them into coherent systems of > meaning.\\"Neal, Arthur G. National Trauma and Collective Memory: > Extraordinary Events in the American Experience. M.E. Sharpe: London, 2005. = Depictions of the World Trade Center = After the September 11 attacks, a couple of movies and TV shows deleted scenes or episodes set within the World Trade Center. For example, The Simpsons episode \\"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\\", which first aired in 1997, was removed from syndication after the attacks because a large portion of the episode took place at and inside World Trade Center. Songs that mentioned the World Trade Center were no longer aired on radio, and the release dates of some films, such as the 2002 films Sidewalks of New York, People I Know, and Spider-Man, were delayed so producers could remove scenes that included the World Trade Center. The 2001 film Kissing Jessica Stein, which was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival the day before the attacks, had to be modified before its general public release, so the filmmakers could delete the scenes that depicted the World Trade Center. Other episodes and films mentioned the attacks directly, or depicted the World Trade Center in alternate contexts. The production of some family-oriented films was also sped up due to a large demand for that genre following the attacks. Demand for horror and action films decreased, but within a short time demand returned to normal. By the first anniversary of the attacks, over sixty \\"memorial films\\" had been created. Filmmakers were criticized for removing scenes related to the World Trade Center. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post said \\"if we erase the towers from our art, we erase from our memories\\". Author Donald Langmead compared the phenomenon to the 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, where historic mentions of events are retroactively \\"rectified\\". Other filmmakers such as Michael Bay, who directed the 1998 film Armageddon, opposed retroactively removing references to the World Trade Center based on post-9/11 attitudes. Oliver Stone's film World Trade Center‚Äîthe first movie that specifically examined the effects of the attacks on the World Trade Center, as contrasted with the effects elsewhere‚Äîwas released in 2006. Several years after the attacks, works such as \\"The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson\\" were placed back in syndication. The National September 11 Museum has preserved many of the works that feature depictions of the original World Trade Center. = Influence on comic books = American comic books have always carried patriotic tones, especially during the Cold War‚Äîperhaps the most notable example is the character Captain America. 9/11 shifted the political climate and with it re-centered the public's attention on Muslims. Perhaps the most mainstream example of the influence 9/11 had on comic books is Iron Man, who was previously an anti- communist crusader; his canon was rewritten in comics after 9/11 and in the widely popular 2008 film Iron Man. In the film, billionaire Tony Stark learns his weapons were sold without his knowledge to various terrorist groups after he was kidnapped and tortured in Afghanistan.Pumphrey, N 2016, 'Avenger, Mutant, or Allah: A Short Evolution of the Depiction of Muslims in Marvel Comics', Muslim World, 106, 4, pp. 781-794, Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost, viewed November 16, 2017 Symbolism The September 11 attacks gained an iconographic meaning. This was due to the fact that the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City were portrayed as symbolic buildings representing American financial power, and the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia was portrayed as a symbolic building representing American military power. Backed up by the media and literature, many people see 9/11 as an attack on the economic and military power of America.Hartwig, Marcel. Die Traumatisierte Nation?. Transcript Verlag: Bielefeld, 2011. Furthermore, the attacks are often pictured as a symbol for an era of war and terrorism. Jargon inspired by 9/11 ;Nine-eleven or 9/11:in the U.S. date notation for September 11. The practice of referring to ominous dates through this shorthand has continued, for example, with 7/7 for the 2005 London bombings. Even in English-speaking countries which typically use a different date format to the U.S. \\"month/day/year\\", the event is still commonly referred to as \\"Nine-eleven\\". For example, \\"Nine-eleven\\" will tend to be used in everyday speech in the United Kingdom, despite how British people would otherwise write September 11 as \\"11/09\\". ;Pre-9/11 and Post-9/11: Terms used to describe the period of time and the state of the world before and after the attack, regarding 9/11 as an epoch. They are often used to denote foreign policy and domestic security measures as they existed before or after the attacks. ;Ground Zero: Ground zero is a generic term for the point on the Earth's surface closest to a detonation. Capitalized, it is shorthand for the World Trade Center site; used, for example, in \\"Ground Zero mosque\\", a pejorative for the Cordoba House or Park51 Islamic center. ;The Bathtub: the excavated foundations of the World Trade Center. Although not a new term, it gained prominence during rescue, cleanup and ongoing reconstruction efforts. ;The Pile:the rubble of the collapsed World Trade Center. ;Jumper:A jumper is someone who commits suicide by jumping from a height. It is unclear which of the \\"jumpers\\" seen falling from the WTC had jumped and which fell while trying to climb to safety. The medical examiner's office ruled homicide for all bodies, unable to distinguish jumpers from those who died inside the towers. \\"The Falling Man\\" is an iconic photograph of a jumper. ;\\"Let's roll\\": reported to have been uttered by Flight 93 passenger Todd Beamer shortly before he and fellow passengers apparently rushed the cockpit.Let's roll (Note: Wikipedia is not ordinarily used as a reference; however this article is well-referenced and its references support the statement here.) ;FPCON Delta: the highest state of terrorist alert issued by the U.S. Armed Forces = Media slogans = Various slogans and captions were employed by media outlets to brand coverage of the September 11 terrorist attack, its after effects, and the U.S. government response. The slogans for American media were typically positioned on the bottom third of television broadcasts, or as banners across the top of newspaper pages. Designs typically incorporated a patriotic red, white, and blue motif, along with an explicit graphic of the American flag. Examples include: * \\"America Attacked\\", \\"A Nation United\\" (ABC) * \\"Attack on America\\" (NBC) * \\"A Nation Challenged\\", \\"Day of Terror\\", \\"Portraits of Grief\\" (The New York Times) * \\"America's New War\\", \\"War Against Terror\\", \\"America under Attack\\" (CNN) * \\"War on Terror\\" (Fox News) * \\"America on Alert\\", \\"America under Attack\\" (MSNBC) * \\"The Second Pearl Harbor\\" (Honolulu Advertiser) * \\"War on America\\" (The Daily Telegraph) = U.S. government terms = * War on Terrorism (also Global War on Terror) refers to the political response from the U.S. Government to the attacks of 9/11 and includes the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the color-coded national threat condition reporting system, the Patriot Act, and the prison camp in Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba. * Enduring Freedom ‚Äì name for U.S.-led military response in Afghanistan, Philippines, Horn of Africa, and Trans Sahara. * Infinite Justice ‚Äì original name for U.S.-led military response, dropped after religious overtones were pointed out by a reporter at a press briefing  See also  * Artwork damaged or destroyed in the September 11 attacks * List of books about the September 11 attacks * Discrimination and National Security Initiative * List of cultural references to the September 11 attacks * List of entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks  References  Bibliography * *  Further reading  * *  External links  *Live reporting of various TV stations on 9/11 Category:Aftermath of the September 11 attacks 9/11 ","title":"Cultural influence of the September 11 attacks"},{"id":"48326576","text":"Frank Murphy Jr. (born January 19, 1934) is an American politician in the state of California.

Gregory Alan Elliott was charged with criminally harassing three women in the Toronto area, following a protracted dispute with feminist activist Stephanie Guthrie. The case was considered to have implications for free speech in Canada, and to be the first prosecution for harassment solely involving activity on social networking website Twitter. After the trial's conclusion earlier cases of criminal harassment on Twitter were found but Elliott's is still the only one known that didn't include any violent threats. Charges involving one of the women were dropped before trial. On January 22, 2016, Ontario Court of Justice judge Brent Knazan acquitted Elliot of the remaining charges of criminal harassment. Elliott soon returned to Twitter after having been restricted from using the Internet as a bail condition for three years. Background Following her 2012 Kickstarter campaign for the Tropes vs. Women in Video Games video series, feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian began to receive large volumes of online criticism and harassment. One form of harassment commonly decried in the media was a Newgrounds game in which players punched a photograph of Sarkeesian, causing her to appear progressively more bruised and injured. The game's creator, Bendilin Spurr, who had previously made a similar game about punching conservative lawyer and anti-video-game activist Jack Thompson, denied that the games promoted real violence. Stephanie Guthrie, a Toronto-based feminist activist, was among those who objected to Spurr's game, and contacted news organizations and potential employers in Spurr's hometown. Gregory Alan Elliott, a Toronto artist, criticized Guthrie's actions as \\"every bit as vicious as the face- punch game\\". In response, Guthrie and others blocked him on Twitter and reported his account to the site's operators, who found he wasn't violating their terms of service. Elliott continued tweeting criticism to their accounts and commenting on their online and offline activities. Guthrie convened a meeting of friends to discuss Elliott's behaviour. An investigating officer later testified that he found that none of Elliott's messages were sexual in nature or threatened harm against any of the women. Trial Elliott was charged by the Crown in November 2012 for breach of a peace bond and criminal harassment of Guthrie. Elliott was released on bail on the condition that he did not tweet or access Twitter, have a smartphone or use a computer with Internet access. Two more women, Paisley Rae and Heather Reilly, subsequently went to police in January 2013. Elliott lost his job shortly after his arrest. The charge related to Rae was dropped by the Crown late into the trial on the day she was to take the stand to testify, while the charge related to Reilly continued. The case hinged on whether the women reasonably feared for their safety. In cross-examination, Guthrie defended her continued tweeting and allegations about Elliott, including creating hashtags to mock him, after having blocked him. Elliott's defense lawyer said that Guthrie was the one harassing and abusing. The trial had to be delayed in March 2014 after the judge received a signed letter alleging a conspiracy against Elliott by the complainants, that also included the Ministry of the Attorney General. On January 22, 2016, all charges against Elliott were dismissed. Judge Knazan said there was no reasonable fear for their safety as Elliott's tweets contained nothing of a \\"violent or sexual nature\\" and there was no indication he intended to hurt the women. Knazan wrote that Elliott was engaged in legitimate debate, and the judge gave the opinion that those who create Twitter hashtags do not have a right to control who uses the hashtags. On March 4, 2016, Judge Knazan amended his original ruling which claimed Elliott‚Äôs tweets were \\"obscene and homophobic in at least two instances\\" when it was discovered that the tweets were actually made by an account impersonating Elliott. The judge issued a correction saying \\"Mr. Elliott never wrote homophobic tweets, used homophobic language or was homophobic.\\" He further stated that the fake account could be considered the criminal offense of \\"impersonation with intent to cause mischief.\\" Reactions Elliott is believed to be the first Canadian prosecuted solely for tweets, and several commentators believe the case has significant implications for free expression and freedom of speech in Canada. Robert Tracinski of The Federalist opined that \\"[a]nti-harassment laws are being used as a tool of harassment.\\" The National Post later reported that there had been three previous cases involving harassment on Twitter. In one case, Damany Skeene was convicted of criminal harassment and uttering threats against Conservative MP Michelle Rempel. Another involved a woman being found guilty of criminally harassing then Quebec premier Pauline Marois and the third involved a Montreal man pleading guilty to uttering threats against atheists. A Toronto coffee shop was the subject of controversy over artwork by Elliott that the shop displayed.

APL designs and manufactures biomass gasifiers and builds and markets small-scale (15 kW - 150 kW) electrical generators fueled by these gasifiers. In 2013, All Power Labs reached an installed base of 500 machines in approximately 40 countries. As of 2015, APL employed 30 staff, including engineering, manufacturing, management, sales, and technical support staff, on the site of the former Shipyard, an approximately 20,000 sq.ft. facility that includes APL‚Äôs offices, R&D;, manufacturing and production facilities. In 2015 it established a board of directors to which it added Daniel Kammen and Tom Dinwoodie. History Jim Mason and Jessica Hobbs founded APL in 2007 on the site of, and based on, the work of the former Shipyard. The Shipyard was a collaborative art-development space established in 2001 by Mason in a dozen shipping-container workspaces assembled around a small machine shop in West Berkeley. Containers were rented out to a mix of artists, engineers and scientists he selected mostly from among his collaborators on art projects for the Burning Man festival. Unable to get approval for a grid-power connection due to zoning issues, the Shipyard community assembled an off-grid power system combining 2 kW of used photovoltaic panels, a 4000 amp hour surplus telecommunication battery bank, a pair of used diesel generators running on biodiesel made in an on-site biodiesel-reactor facility, and began experimenting with Biomass Gasification as a potential power source. APL's initial goal was education and experimentation in open-source alternative energy technologies in an attempt to create a do-it-yourself (DIY) power- hacking culture. Within the first year, the company limited its focus to the open-source development of biomass gasification technology, and began to design and manufacture a range of open-source DIY Gasifier Experimenters Kits (GEK), whose plans and cad files were made available online. Water Abundance XPRIZE During a 24 hour period ending on September 29, 2018, at the APL facility in Berkeley, California, APL along with the Skysource/Skywater Alliance, successfully won the $1.5 million Water XPRIZE by producing over 2,000 liters of water in one day at a final cost of less than 2 cents per liter using only renewable energy. An APL PP30 Biomass Gasifier Genset powered three Skywater 300 atmospheric water generators to extract water from the atmosphere and the additional residual moisture generated by the drying of the woodchips used to fuel the gasifier. Products In 2010, APL began to manufacture an integrated biomass gasifier-genset named the Power Pallet in 10 kW and 20 kW ratings. By the end of 2013 the GEK kits and 10 kW version were abandoned along with the company's open-source ethos with its release of a 20 kW unit using a proprietary gasifier design based on Mason‚Äôs patents. In late 2016, the company‚Äôs principle product was the PP30 Power Pallet 25 kW biomass genset which included Combined Heat and Power (CHP) and Grid-tied Electrical System features as standard equipment as well as optional accessories. A principal segment of their market is directed at addressing energy poverty in the developing world. In 2015, using a California Energy Commission (CEC) grant intended to incentivize forest-fire remediation in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains, APL continued development of a 150 kW version of a shipping- container-based genset named the Powertainer that was initially built as a 100 kW rated prototype in 2012 with the assistance of a US Department of Energy grant. All Power Labs also began to produce the Biochar Experimenter‚Äôs Kit which focuses on producing biochar, which also produces wood gas to run an internal combustion engine.BiocharALL POWER LABS LLC AND THE BIOCHAR EXPERIMENTER‚ÄôS KIT (BEK) Operation Material and Process Flows in a GEK Gasifier Biomass Gasification uses high temperatures in an low-oxygen environment to covert woody feedstocks into a Syngas fuel composed predominantly of flammable hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) gases. When waste biomass is used as the feedstock and the biochar byproduct is sequestered, such as when used as a soil amendment, the operation results in Negative carbon dioxide emission. APL's gasifiers use a variety of lignocellulosic biomass (woody biomass) such as wood chips, nut shells, and other agricultural bi-products as feedstock, at the rate of approximately 1kg/kWh.

Reason Proponents of this event suggest that since there are relatively fewer visible and practical difficulties associated with olfactory disorders than with visual or auditory impairments, the nature of olfactory dysfunction and its consequences for an individual's safety and quality of life are not widely understood. Anosmia Awareness Day aims to expose this situation, push for the development of successful treatments, and inform the general public about the serious impact that anosmia can have on a person's life. Anosmia sufferers have been shown to be susceptible to dangerous situations such as gas leaks, fires, hazardous chemical vapors, and ingesting spoiled food. Additionally, people with smell loss can also experience difficulty with eating due to the close relationship between smell and taste. Studies also indicate that some individuals develop depression in response to feelings of social isolation, fears regarding safety and personal odor management, and a diminished connection to pleasure, emotion, and memory. History Anosmia Awareness Day was first launched by Daniel Schein, an American man with olfactory dysfunction, on February 27, 2012. The event page that he created on Facebook established the date and the practice of wearing red to show support for the cause. Subsequently, smell and taste centers (like The Monell Center in Philadelphia, PA) and charities (like Fifth Sense in the United Kingdom) have thrown their support behind the event, linking it to research and educational initiatives aimed at patients, doctors, and the general public. Fifth Sense, a UK-based charity that provides support and information to people with smell and taste disorders, has connected Anosmia Awareness Day to its international online awareness and fundraising campaign called #LongLostSmell.

During World War II it was Fort Varnum, a coastal defense fort. History Fort Varnum was built as part of a general modernization of US coast defenses begun in 1940 with the outbreak of war in Europe and the Fall of France. The fort is named for General James Mitchell Varnum of the Revolutionary War. It was built to relocate previously-emplaced weapons to a more useful location nearer the entrance to Narragansett Bay. The fort was sited to reinforce new 6-inch gun batteries at Fort Greene in Point Judith and Fort Burnside in Jamestown. FortWiki article on Fort VarnumBerhow, p. 205 The fort was intended to protect the West Passage of Narragansett Bay as part of the Harbor Defenses of Narragansett Bay. Fort Varnum's main armament was Battery House, two 6-inch M1900 guns on pedestal mounts, completed in 1942. The battery was a relocation of Battery House at Fort Getty in Jamestown. Two 3-inch M1903 guns on pedestal mounts were planned for Battery Armistead, relocated from Fort Kearny, now the University of Rhode Island Narragansett Bay Campus. However, these guns arrived in unusable condition, and Fort Varnum's commander asked that they be scrapped. They were stored instead and were never mounted. Better light weapons were provided in 1943 as Anti-Motor Torpedo Boat Battery (AMTB) 921, with four 90 mm guns, two on fixed mounts and two on towed mounts. Several fire control stations were built in Narragansett disguised as beach cottages; these may date from the start of the Endicott Program circa 1900. Most have been destroyed; some survive at Camp Varnum. In 1947, with the war over, Fort Varnum's guns were scrapped along with almost all other US coast artillery weapons.

Founded in 1968 by Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, the yeshiva has several branches in Israel and the United States, and spawned several educational programs for Diaspora Jews. Name The name of the yeshiva is an acronym for Israel Torah Research Institute, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit. From its founding, the yeshiva was officially called Yeshivas Midrash HaTalmud Tiferes Avraham ‚Äì Itri (Yeshiva for the Study of the Talmud, Glory of Abraham ‚Äì Itri). After the death of its founder, Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, in 2009, the name was changed to Yeshivas Midrash HaTalmud Zehav Mordechai ‚Äì Itri (Yeshiva for the Study of the Talmud, Gold of Mordechai ‚Äì Itri). History Yeshivas Itri was founded in 1968 by Rabbi Mordechai Elefant, an American-born educator who was a close student of Rabbi Aharon Kotler, Rabbi Aryeh Leib Malin and Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik. He married the granddaughter of Yaakov Yosef Herman. The initial student body comprised 60 kollel students, but enrollment soon expanded with unmarried yeshiva students. The yeshiva met for several years in the Orient House hotel in East Jerusalem. Elefant successfully relocated it to the premises of an old British Mandate hospital in the southeast of the city, near the Arab village of Beit Safafa, in the 1970s. Students were housed in adjacent apartments. By 1971, enrollment was at 250 students, the majority from the United States. The yeshiva received funding from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, government sources, and private donations. Over time, the institution grew to encompass a kollel, yeshiva gedola, yeshiva ketana, and Talmud Torah. Branches of the yeshiva were also opened in Hadera and in the United States. =Fraud investigation= In 1999 yeshiva administrator Rabbi Chaim Weiss and businessman David Appel were suspected of embezzling NIS 9 million from yeshiva coffers during Elefant's medical leave. The police investigation carried on for years; by 2014, police theorized that the stolen money was meant to pay for the defense of Aryeh Deri, who was convicted on charges of fraud and bribery in 2000. Offshoots Several educational programs for Diaspora Jews were spun off from Yeshivas Itri. They include: * Yeshivat HaMivtar, founded in 1967 by alumnus Rabbi Chaim Brovender for English-speaking college-age students. * Yeshiva Shaar Hatorah, founded in 1974 in Queens, New York as a branch of Yeshivas Itri by Rabbis Kalman Epstein and Sholom Spitz. * Shvut Ami Center for Russian Jews, founded in 1976 as a branch of Yeshivas Itri by Shimon Grilius, a former Prisoner of Zion; it later became an independent program. * Bruria (later Shappell's women's college), founded in 1976 by Rabbi Chaim Brovender as a spinoff of Yeshivas Itri's women's program. * Shapell's/Darche Noam (originally known as Hartman's), was a spinoff of the Yeshivas Itri program for English-speaking men.

On Will Drake's orders, they break through the seal and are attacked and killed by two ghouls. John Lowe is undergoing evaluation at the West Los Angeles Health Center. Secretly he came there after seeing the hospital's name in one of the Ten Commandments Killer's case files. Elizabeth and Iris remark on the unsealed corridor, and Iris notices how scared the former is. Marcy checks in, and is later killed in her room by the two ghouls. In 1925, Elizabeth admires the actor Rudolph Valentino. He invites her for dinner, which is interrupted by his wife Natacha Rambova. They explain that their divorce was a \\"show\\" and together seduce Elizabeth. Hotel Cortez opens for business with James March hosting a party. There, Elizabeth comes to know that Valentino has died, and tries to commit suicide but is saved by March. Since his death, Elizabeth continues visiting Valentino's tomb. One day, after she and March marry, she encounters him alongside Natacha. Valentino relates a story during his The Son of the Sheik press tour. He met F. W. Murnau, director of the vampire film, Nosferatu, who offered him immortality, but on condition of public death. Valentino and Natacha subsequently turn Elizabeth while March watches from afar. John wanders near the criminally insane ward, overhearing the security guard talking about a killer within. Later, he overpowers the guard and breaks into the restricted room 153, finding a young girl called Wren. She tells him she helped the Ten Commandments Killer during the murders, and John tells her that it was not her fault. In 1986, her father abandoned her in front of the Hotel Cortez, and Elizabeth turned her. She says that if John finds a way to get her out, she will take him to the killer. Valentino and Natacha are revealed to be the trapped ghouls, and they bicker while they recover. March and Hazel prepare a dinner for Elizabeth, who has agreed to dine with him at least once per month. She tells him her plans to marry Drake. She reveals Drake as her new love, but March clarifies that Elizabeth was never in love with him, hence he trapped Valentino and Natacha inside the sealed hallway. Regenerated, Valentino and Natacha check out of the Hotel. Elsewhere, Wren and John escape the hospital. She asks if he intends to kill the killer, receiving a positive answer. She responds by saying that she likes him, before running into oncoming traffic and being hit by a truck.

And, in a rare occasion, we see her genuinely, truly scared.\\" Another positive review came from Matt Fowler of IGN who rated the episode 7.6 on 10, and believed that the \\"strongest\\" plots of Hotel were surrounding those of Evan Peters' James March character. He also complimented that the Countess' storyline was expanded and the connections were established. However, Fowler believed Gaga's acting needed improvement with her dialogue delivery. Michael Calia from The Wall Street Journal described the episode as \\"[conjuring] a version of Hollywood history soaked in blood, sex and treachery. You know, like actual Hollywood history, except involving the undead\\". Emily L. Stephens from The A.V. Club gave it a rating of A‚Äì, giving positive review for the plotline, the time utilization and the \\"tight narrative\\", complimfenting Gaga, Bates and Peters' acting. She ended the review with her observation saying, \\"The characters of \\"Flicker\\" are seduced by the allure of immortality. They strive to become gods, if not through the flicker of film and the adoration of the masses, then by sacrificing their humanity.\\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Darren Franch complimented one line spoken by Bates, \\"I couldn't pick my butthole out of a lineup\\", in reference to the character Will Drake getting his anus waxed, and wrote, \\"What a line! I would take a whole episode of American Horror Story that was just every member of the cast stepping into the spotlight on a darkened stage, clearing their throat, and intoning.\\" The line was also commended by Lacy Baugher from The Baltimore Sun. However, Baugher felt that Denis O'Hare and Angela Bassett were underutilized. Ryan Sandoval from TV.com commended the backstory of the characters in the episode, adding that the \\"episode was essentially showing us the bare-bones theme of the whole season like a corpse dunked in an acid bath: the cost of fame\\". Danielle Henderson from Cosmopolitan gave a positive review to the portrayal of Valentino and the fan reactions surrounding his death in the episode, as well as his fictional portrayal as a vampire. However, Henderson criticized Gaga's emotionless delivery and her makeup in the scene with Peters.

Khomyakova was one of the first female pilots of the Soviet Air Force, and on 24 September 1942, she shot down a German bomber. She was widely reported as the first woman pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft, but later changed to the first in a night battle. Khomyakova was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, but was killed in a flight accident only two weeks later. Biography Valeria Dmitrievna Khomyakova was born in 1914 in Moscow, Russian Empire, the daughter of a chemical engineer. She completed her primary and secondary education, and in 1937 graduated from the D. Mendeleev University of Chemical Technology of Russia, taking a position as an engineer at the Frunze Plant in Moscow. Khomyakova began flying at the local flying club and became certified as a flight instructor. She was deputy commander of her squadron of the 586th Women's Fighter Regiment. In 1942, during Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Khomyakova joined the Soviet Air Force. She became one of the first female fighter pilots of the Soviet Union, quickly reaching the rank of senior lieutenant, and was assigned to the 586th Air Defense Regiment, an air defense regiment of all-female fighter pilots. On 24 September, 1942, while flying night patrol over Saratov in a Yak-1, Khomyakova shot down a Junkers Ju 88 of the German Luftwaffe flown by Oberstleutnant Gerhard Maak, a decorated bomber pilot of KG 76. Ogoniok, a youth-magazine, published that it was the ‚Äúfirst time in history that a woman fighter pilot had shot down an enemy aircraft‚Äù, and the story was repeated for decades in both Soviet and foreign press. The record has since been amended and now states that she was the first female to shoot down an enemy in a night battle. Death Khomyakova died at an airfield in Saratov Oblast when she crashed during take-off on October 6, 1942. Shortly after shooting down Gerhard Maak's Ju 88, Khomyakova was assigned to perform numerous runs to protect supply lines and railway bridges over the Volga River, and had recently returned from Moscow where she received an Order of the Red Banner award for her achievement. Khomyakova was sleeping in a dugout when she was woken by her superior, Major Tamara Kazarinova, to make another run despite being exhausted, making her unfit for duty. Due to Khomyakova's death, Kazarinova was relieved of duty by General Mikhail Gromadin, and transferred her to his staff.

She studied at both the √âcole Sp√©ciale d'Architecture and the √âcole des Beaux-Arts de Paris, before returning to Bulgaria and completing her degree in architecture in 1952 from the Sofia Polytechnic. From 1952 to 1972 she worked at the firm Sofproekt before becoming head of its design studio. In 1968, she was awarded the Koliu Ficheto award for her design of a day care center. In 1969, she built the \\"Ho Chi Minh Kindergarten\\", which at the time, it was considered \\"revolutionary\\" to design a settling for children in which even the furniture was specifically selected. Prior to that time, most daycare buildings had donated furnishings, but mirroring a small hall of the United Nations Building in Geneva, the design called for beds, tables and chairs to fit the space and the children's needs. Due to some financing problems, the school was not completed until 1969. Her design of the Cultural Center in Pancharevo was honored with the Red Banner of Labor Award in 1977. Stancheva left the employ of Sofproekt in 1982, but continued working with them on a consulting basis until opening her own practice. In 1985, she received the Gold Badge of the Bulgarian Union of Architects for her contributions to the architectural heritage.

It was a prisoner-of-war camp for German prisoners in 1945. It is now the Narragansett Bay Campus of the University of Rhode Island. In many sources it is spelled Fort Kearney. History Fort Kearny was built under the Endicott Program 1904-1908 as part of the Coast Defenses of Narragansett Bay. The fort is named for Major General Philip Kearny, killed in the American Civil War. It protected the West Passage of Narragansett Bay, along with Fort Getty in Jamestown and Fort Greble on Dutch Island. FortWiki article on Fort KearnyBerhow, p. 205 The fort was primarily armed with six 6-inch M1905 guns (152 mm) on disappearing carriages, four in Battery French and two in Battery Cram. Two 3-inch M1903 guns (76 mm) were also present in Battery Armistead. Battery French was named for William H. French, a general in the Civil War. Battery Cram was named for Thomas J. Cram, a topographical engineer in the Civil War. Battery Armistead was named for Captain Lewis G. A. Armistead, who was killed in the War of 1812. The guns of Battery French were removed in 1917 for potential service on the Western Front; three of the guns were sent to France for use on field carriages, but sources indicate that none of the 6-inch gun regiments completed training before the Armistice and thus they did not see combat.History of the Coast Artillery Corps in World War I The guns were not returned to Fort Kearny. In World War II a large-scale modernization of coast defenses was implemented; in Narragansett Bay this was centered on Fort Church and Fort Greene. Fort Kearny was slated for disarmament once the new defenses were completed. In 1942 the 3-inch guns of Battery Armistead were relocated to Fort Varnum, and in 1943, with improved defenses completed, Fort Kearny's two remaining guns at Battery Cram were scrapped. Fort Kearny was a prisoner-of-war camp in World War II, beginning in February 1945. It was the headquarters of a program to re-educate German prisoners with democratic values, one element of which was the German- language newspaper Der Ruf (The Call). Present Fort Kearny is now the Narragansett Bay Campus of the University of Rhode Island. A small nuclear research reactor has been built on top of Battery French. Battery Cram and Battery Armistead have been refurbished as office space.

Early life Olin Wheeler was born May 1, 1852 in Mansfield, Ohio to parents Reverend Alfred Wheeler and Lydia Curtis Wheeler. His brother Edward Jewett Wheeler later became the editor of The Literary Digest and Current History. Wheeler was educated at Baldwin University and Allegheny College. In 1874, Wheeler graduated with a degree in Civil Engineering from Cornell University. Western exploration Upon graduating from Cornell in 1874, Wheeler obtained employment with the Geographical and Geological Survey of the Rocky Mountain Region headed by geologist John Wesley Powell. In 1876, Wheeler was the assistant to John H. Renshawe, working on topographical surveys in southwestern Utah and southeastern Nevada. In 1877, Wheeler was the assistant of Professor A. H. Thompson who headed the triangulation party of the survey. The party operated in the region west of the Green River. Wheeler continued with the Powell survey until its conclusion in 1879. After leaving the survey Wheeler obtained an appointment to work on the tenth United States census in Washington, DC. During summer months he was the disbursing officer at Virginia City, Nevada, and during the winters he was engaged in special census work at the Capital. He gained valuable experience as a special correspondent for various newspapers, writing on Congressional matters and public events. In 1882 Wheeler married Anna E. S. Burr of Mount Vernon, Ohio and settled in St. Paul, Minnesota under the employment of Elias F. Drake, a prominent capitalist. Wheeler held this position until June, 1892. Northern Pacific Railroad In June 1892, Olin Wheeler was hired by the Northern Pacific Railroad to head its advertising, a position he held for 16 years. In 1893, he authored the first of many editions of the annual NPR travel guide, Wonderland which highlighted attractions along the route of the railroad in the west, including Yellowstone National Park and Alaska. Lewis and Clark Olin Wheeler published a two volume work The Trail of Lewis and Clark 1804-1904 in 1904 based upon actual travel over the trail. He was the first historian to produce a significant work about the Lewis and Clark expedition. Wheeler's book gave the general public his personal impressions of the story of the expedition, the waters they navigated and the land they traversed. The volumes contained two hundred illustrations and numerous images of important expedition scenes and landmarks photographed by the various professional photographers who accompanied him in his retracings of the route. The identities of only a few of those photographers are known, including L. A. Huffman of Miles City, Montana, who was a prot√©g√© of Frank J. Haynes. A few images are in the Edward Ayer Collection at the Newberry Library in Chicago, but an intensive search for original prints or negatives of the remaining photos included in The Trail has been fruitless.

Life Ligne was the son of Robert de Ligne, Baron of Barban√ßon (second son of Jean de Ligne, Duke of Arenberg), by Claude, Countess of Salm. His father was commander of the Archduke Albert's honour guard and colonel of a cavalry regiment. Shortly before his death, in 1614, the lordship of Barban√ßon became a principality. On Albert's accession he was therefore Prince of Barban√ßon. In 1618 the young prince entered royal service under Charles Bonaventure de Longueval, Count of Bucquoy, for the campaign against the Bohemian Revolt that opened the Thirty Years' War. In 1620 he was commissioned as captain of a company of cuirassiers in Ambrogio Spinola's Palatinate campaign. In 1622 Isabella Clara Eugenia, governor general of the Spanish Netherlands, appointed him general of a Walloon regiment. During the campaign of 1625 he became general in chief of the bandes d'ordonnance. On 19 June 1627 he was awarded the Golden Fleece by Philip IV of Spain, being invested in Brussels on 18 June 1628.Louis Prosper Gachard, \\"Barban√ßon, Albert de Ligne, prince de\\", Biographie nationale de Belgique vol. 1 (Brussels, 1866), 686-698. Barban√ßon raised a regiment at his own expense with the intention of supporting Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy in the War of the Mantuan Succession, but with the changing situation in Italy and the Low Countries he remained in the Low Countries to fight the Dutch. On 27 April 1634 the Marquis of Aytona, on Philip IV's orders, had Barban√ßon arrested for having corresponded with Cardinal Richelieu in the context of the Conspiracy of Nobles (1632). Information against him had been provided by Balthazar Gerbier, Charles I of England's resident agent in Brussels. After years in prison, mostly in the citadel of Antwerp, but some of the time in Vilvoorde Castle and the castle of Rupelmonde, the prince was ordered released by acting governor general Francisco de Melo on 24 December 1642. He had been repeatedly investigated and questioned, but never formally brought to trial or sentenced. Only in 1658 was he again commissioned as a royal officer, being appointed commander of the garrison of Ypres and captain general of artillery. Barban√ßon died in Madrid in April 1674. Marriage and family The Prince of Barban√ßon married Marie de Barban√ßon, Viscountess of Dave, daughter and heiress to Everard de Barban√ßon and Louise of East Frisia.

He remained in close contact with artists in Poland, where he exhibited his artwork inter alia in Warsaw at the Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art, and he co-operated with Polish journals. In 1903, he returned to Poland, and lived in Warsaw. In 1905, he became a member of the Society of the Incentive for Fine Arts (Towarzystwo Zachƒôty Sztuk Piƒôknych).

The ensemble cast includes Carter Jenkins, Lawrence Kao, Allegra Masters, Michael Nardelli, Julie Benz, Mercy Malick, Lisa Pelikan, and Cesar Garcia. It was inspired by the 1957 drama 12 Angry Men and was shot in 2014. It premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival on May 28, 2015, before being released to video- on-demand on October 16, 2015. In the film, fifty people wake up in a darkened room, only to find that one of them is killed every two minutes or when they attempt to leave. When they realize that they can control which person is selected to die, blocs emerge based on personal values.  Plot  Fifty people awaken in a darkened room, arranged in two concentric circles around a black dome. Noises sound when they attempt to move or touch the others. When someone ignores the warning and leaves formation, a beam from the dome kills them, and their body is removed. As the others panic, a man attempts to calm them, but the device kills him mid-sentence. Thereafter, every two minutes, another person is killed. After several people die, the group realizes that the technology allows them to use hand gestures to vote for who dies, while arrows on the floor show each person their own vote but not others'. They attempt to all boycott the vote, but someone is still randomly selected to die. Following someone's suggestion, the group buys time to think by deciding in advance to eliminate the elderly for the next selections. The captives discuss where they are, how they got there, who has abducted them, and why. A young man, Eric, remembers attempting to flee Los Angeles, and others concur. Eric says that he was pulled into the air, later waking in a red room with other humans. The old man next in line agrees, saying he saw and heard aliens. The disbelieving group eliminates him instead of listening. After another member of the group aggressively targets a 52-year-old cancer survivor over the objections of people who do not consider her elderly, he is eliminated. Several people say they recognize the others: a man identifies the woman next to him as his wife, another man identifies the doctor who was having an affair with him, and a tattooed man is eliminated after he admits to a cop's accusation of domestic violence. After several minorities are quickly eliminated, an African-American man claims the process has become racist. Several others dispute this, but when the cop goes on a racist rant, he is selected next. The captives experiment with voting, find they cannot vote for themselves, and attempt to give one vote to every person in the circle. One man gives a second vote for a pregnant woman, so Eric votes for him; this causes a tie and the man is killed in a run-off vote. The group realizes that one of the final two people left must not vote (and be killed) to render a winner. After several take their own lives by leaving formation to buy the others time, an atheist antagonizes the theists who praised the volunteers' faith. The atheist is briefly saved, but when he mocks the girl beside him for having her boss pay for her breast enlargement, he is killed. A homophobic lawyer targets a lesbian to the next to die, but he is killed instead. The group splinters, with two main blocs emerge. One bloc (led by Eric, a Marine, and a one-armed man) believes that everyone should sacrifice themselves to save the pregnant woman and a girl for last, and the other bloc (led by a bearded man and a rich man) wants to eliminate them immediately as a threat to their survival, as they believe everyone is equal and no special privileges should be afforded to anyone. A husband is forced to vote with Eric's bloc when they threaten to eliminate his wife, but, under interrogation, the couple admit that they concocted the relationship to curry favor, resulting in the \\"husband's\\" elimination. Eric's faction incurs heavy losses but eliminates the other faction, leaving only Eric, the pregnant woman, the girl, and a silent man who has never voted. Eric theorizes that aliens have used the process to learn about humanity's values. After the silent man is eliminated, Eric and the girl agree to simultaneously sacrifice themselves. As the girl commits suicide, Eric instead casts a last-second vote to kill the pregnant woman, only to realize that the pregnant woman's unborn child counts as a person. Eric votes to kill the child and then wakes up in Los Angeles where he joins a group of people, composed of an equal number of women, men, and children, watching a fleet of alien crafts float over Los Angeles.

Producer and star Nardelli, already a fan of the directors' webseries The Vault, became involved after they pitched the script to him. Pre-production took about three years. Nardelli said he was impressed with the script's ability to cover political, social, and psychological issues. In comparing it to Cube, he said Circle provides more answers and gives more of a definitive ending. Casting for some roles was broad, and others were specific; the intention was always to have a wide cross-section. The writer-directors did not intend for any character to be outright villainous, though several espouse intolerant opinions. Hann and Miscione wanted to address topical issues and provide a cynically-tinged, antagonistic presence for the film. Principal photography began in February 2014 and lasted two weeks. All of the scenes were storyboarded prior to shooting, and the directors tried to be as prepared as possible; regardless, they still encountered problems, as all actors had to be available for every shoot. Nardelli said that the psychological extremes experienced by the cast made it difficult to wind down after shooting.  Release  Circle premiered on May 28, 2015, at the Seattle International Film Festival. FilmBuff released it to video-on-demand on October 16, 2015.  Reception  The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 50% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"Twilight Zone-y drama [that] works better than expected\\". Tony Kay of City Arts Online wrote, \\"The movie engineers suspense expertly, and there's puzzle-box fun in trying to piece together exactly what's going on as each prospective execution barrels forward.\\" Ain't It Cool News wrote that although it is not \\"a fully realized concept\\", it is \\"thought-provoking\\" and provocative. Valeria Koulikova of the Queen Anne News wrote, \\"While the film's attempts to address social problems are beautifully done, leaving a bit of uncertainty in the end would have made a stronger finale.\\" After the movie was released on Netflix, the writers and director opened a verified Q&A; on Reddit. Among the many topics covered, the writers spoke about the artistic and logistical reasons behind shooting in one room, and the benefits of using unknown actors.

Mohanty states that Western feminisms have tended to gloss over the differences between Southern women, but that the experience of oppression is incredibly diverse, and contingent upon historical, cultural, and individual reasons.Felski, Rita.

The rivalry started in 1921, and Ole Miss currently leads the series, 47‚Äì12‚Äì2. Football series history As of 2019, Ole Miss is tied as Memphis's most frequent opponent, and Memphis is Ole Miss's most common non-conference opponent. The University of Memphis in Memphis, Tennessee and University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi are around 80 miles apart. Their football teams first met in 1921, with Ole Miss winning the first 17 games. The 1963 game had a scoreless tie, and Memphis won its first game in the series in 1967. From 1962 to 1995, the series was played annually except 1975 in Oxford; Memphis; and Jackson, Mississippi. Memphis's first win at Ole Miss was on November 5, 1994. With 11 seconds remaining, Memphis quarterback Joe Borich completed a two-yard touchdown pass to a diving Ryan Roskelly, and Memphis won 17‚Äì16. On October 17, 2015, Memphis upset no. 13 Ole Miss 37‚Äì24. It was the first time the Tigers defeated the Rebels since 2004 and first win over a ranked opponent since 1996. Memphis was Ole Miss's homecoming opponent on October 1, 2016, and no. 16 Ole Miss won 48‚Äì28. However, in early 2019, Ole Miss vacated 33 wins from the 2010 to 2016 seasons, including the 2014 and 2016 wins over Memphis, due to NCAA violations. With the 63rd meeting between Memphis and Ole Miss on August 31, 2019, a 15‚Äì10 Memphis win in Memphis, Ole Miss became tied with Southern Miss as Memphis's most frequent opponent. Rivalry debate It is disputed if this series can be considered a traditional rivalry. As early as 1994, The Commercial Appeal in Memphis referred to the Memphis‚ÄìOle Miss football series as a \\"Mid-South rivalry.\\" In later years, \\"Mid-South rivalry\\" began to be used by the Memphis and Ole Miss athletic departments as well as media outlets like SB Nation. Prior to the 2019 game, former Ole Miss receiver A.J. Brown tweeted that the series was \\"not a rivalry,\\" and Ole Miss quarterback Matt Corral answered \\"no\\" when asked by a reporter if he considered Ole Miss and Memphis to be rivals. As of 2019, there is no future scheduled game between Memphis and Ole Miss, but Ole Miss head coach Matt Luke expressed that he is open to playing Memphis in the future.

It is one of the largest pathology museums in the world and is the largest medical museum in the United Kingdom. Its primary function is to train medical, dental, biomedical and healthcare students and professionals to diagnose diseases.  History  The Gordon Museum was opened in 1905 at King's Guy's Campus as a result of a donation by British Lawyer Robert Gordon, and was intended to be a teaching resource devoted purely to human material. A number of specimens and other medical- related objects have been collected since 1802, and were initially gathered by the first Medical Curator Thomas Hodgkin. These formed the basis of the museum in the first Medical School opened in 1826. In 1829, the museum contains approximately 3000 exhibits, and by 1861, the London Journal of Medicine reported that \\"the Museums are on a scale which entitles them to rank among the first of our national collections\\".  Collections  Use of the Lister's antiseptic spray in 1882 The Gordon Museum holds a collection of approximately 8000 pathological specimens, artefacts, models and paintings, and the earliest specimens are from circa 1608. The Museum contains many human specimens that have impacted on the development of medical studies, including Astley Cooper‚Äôs ligation of the abdominal aorta, and the original specimens of kidneys, adrenal glands and lymph nodes which led Thomas Hodgkin, Thomas Addison and Richard Bright to describe the medical conditions that bear their names. The Museum also houses a number of historic collections and artefacts, for example Joseph Lister's antiseptic spray, and Thomas Hodgkin‚Äôs stethoscope that was the first to be used in England. The Joseph Towne's anatomical and dermatological wax models and Lam Qua's pre-operative tumour paintings are as well displayed in the museum.

He was a longtime pastor of the Calvary Baptist Church in New York City, raising it to prominence in his more than 40 years there. Biography Born in Dalesville, Quebec, Canada, MacArthur converted at the age of 13. He attended Grammar School No. 35 and then graduated from the University of Rochester in 1867, and from Rochester Theological Seminary in 1870. He was ordained and became pastor of Calvary Baptist Church on May 15 of that year, and married Mary Elizabeth Fox on August 4. At the time MacArthur became pastor, Calvary Baptist Church had 238 members. Within five years, church membership more than doubled, and church collections increased sixfold. MacArthur oversaw the construction of a new church building, the formation of three additional congregations, and a growth in membership in the \\"mother church\\" to 2300 members by 1910. MacArthur's publications include hymnals, sermon collections, and apologetic works. In 1906, MacArthur took what was a politically and socially unpopular stance against the Bronx Zoo's popular exhibition and custody of a black man with diminutive stature; an African Bushman named Ota Benga was caged with the zoo's monkeys. MacArthur publicly aligned himself with the city's black clergy and pledged his support to stop the zoo's exhibition. He deemed the well- attended show degrading, brutal and inconsistent with Christian values. With a 41 year tenure, MacArthur served the longest of any pastor in the history of Calvary Baptist Church. MacArthur resigned as pastor from Calvary Baptist Church in 1911, and held the title of pastor emeritus until 1921, when he gave up the title to avoid association with what he called the \\"sensationalism\\" of then-pastor John Roach Straton. After further disagreement with the direction Calvary was going, MacArthur and his wife resigned membership in Calvary in 1922, and transferred membership to Old Cambridge Baptist Church, where his son was pastor. MacArthur died in Florida on February 23, 1923 and was memorialized in New York that May.

Pagon, et al., Editors. 2014, University of Washington, Seattle. Review. DG differs from classic galactosemia in that patients with Duarte galactosemia have partial GALT deficiency whereas patients with classic galactosemia have complete, or almost complete, GALT deficiency.Berry, G., Classic Galactosemia and Clinical Variant Galactosemia, in GeneReviews, R. Pagon, et al., Editors. 2014, University of Washington, Seattle. Review. Duarte galactosemia (DG) is much more common than classic galactosemia, and is estimated to affect close to one in 4,000 infants born in the United States. Historically, most healthcare professionals have considered DG to be clinically mild based on pilot studies and anecdotal experience, and in 2019 a large study confirmed that children with DG are not at increased risk for developmental problems relative to children who do not have DG.Carlock, G., Fischer, S. T., Lynch, M. E., Potter, N. L., Coles, C. D., Epstein, M. P., ... & Wilson, E., Developmental outcomes in Duarte galactosemia. 2018 Pediatrics, doi: 10.1542/peds.2018-2516. Due to regional variations in newborn screening (NBS) protocols, some infants with DG are identified by NBS but others are not.Pyhtila, B.M., et al., Newborn screening for galactosemia in the United States: looking back, looking around, and looking ahead. JIMD Rep, 2015. 15: p. 79-93. Review. Symptoms Infants with DG often show biochemical differences from infants who do not have DG, especially if exposed to milk, but may not show any acute or developmental symptoms. Specifically, when exposed to high levels of dietary galactose, a sugar abundant in breast milk, milk formula, and most dairy products,Van Calcar SC, Bernstein LE, Rohr FJ, Scaman CH, Yannicelli S, Berry GT. A re- evaluation of life-long severe galactose restriction for the nutrition management of classic galactosemia. Mol Genet Metab. 2014 Jul;112(3):191-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ymgme.2014.04.004. Epub 2014 May 2. Review. infants with DG may show elevated levels of galactose and galactose metabolites such as galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1P) and galactitol in blood and urine, respectively. Like many infants who do not have DG, some infants with DG may also show acute symptoms of milk sensitivity, such as Jaundice or vomiting, after exposure to milk but these symptoms may reflect sensitivity of the child to components of milk other than galactose, and typically resolve quickly when the baby is switched to a non-dairy diet, such as soy formula. A large study of developmental outcomes in 6- to 12-year-old children with Duarte galactosemia published in 2019 demonstrated that children with DG do not show increased prevalence of developmental problems relative to children who do not have DG. This suggests that if a child with DG does show developmental problems, other possible causes should be explored. Inheritance Duarte Galactosemia Inheritance: The above figure demonstrates the autosomal recessive mode of DG inheritance. Duarte galactosemia is inherited as a Mendelian autosomal recessive trait. A child with DG carries two different types of GALT alleles, one inherited from each parent. One of these GALT alleles, the G allele, carries a mutation that severely inhibits the function of the encoded GALT enzyme. The other GALT allele, called the D or D2 allele, carries mutations that partially compromise the expression and change some biochemical properties of the encoded GALT enzyme. Together, the G and D alleles only produce about 25% of the normal level of GALT enzyme activity found in a person with two normal (N) GALT alleles. Both parents of a child with DG are considered carriers for GALT variant alleles. One parent carries the G allele and the other carries the D allele. The genotypes of these parents would be written GN and DN, respectively. Without follow-up testing of the parents, it is not possible to know which parent contributed which GALT allele to a child with DG. Like other autosomal recessive conditions, the recurrence risk for DG is 1 in 4, meaning that for each successive child born to parents who already have a child with DG there is a 1 in 4 chance the new baby will also have DG (Figure 2). In rare cases, one parent may actually have DG, while the other parent is a carrier for a G allele (GN). For these couples, there is a 1 in 4 recurrence risk for DG and also a 1 in 4 risk with each pregnancy that the new baby will have classic galactosemia (GG). In extremely rare cases a GALT gene mutation may arise de novo, so that only one parent is a carrier; however, only one case of this has been reported in the literature for galactosemia.Tran, T.T., et al., A De Novo Variant in Galactose-1-P Uridylyltransferase (GALT) Leading to Classic Galactosemia. JIMD Rep, 2015. 19: p. 1-6 Diagnosis Infants with DG are generally diagnosed in follow-up to a positive newborn screening (NBS) result for galactosemia. Specifically, dried blood spots collected for NBS from infants with DG may show low (but generally non-zero) GALT enzyme activity, elevated galactose metabolite levels, or both. DG can also be identified by genetic testing. Of note, not all NBS tests for galactosemia are designed to detect DG so infants with DG born in one jurisdiction may be detected while those born in another may not. For example, all states in the US screen for classic galactosemia in their NBS panel, but some states have lower GALT enzyme activity cut-off levels than others. NBS in states with a low GALT cut off level still detect classic galactosemia, but are likely to miss many infants with DG. In those states, a normal NBS result for galactosemia may not be informative about an infant's DG status. Most infants with DG who are flagged by a positive NBS result for galactosemia have their diagnosis confirmed in a follow-up evaluation. The differential diagnosis for a positive newborn screening result for galactosemia, especially if based on galactose metabolite levels, includes: classic galactosemia, clinical variant galactosemia, DG, GALE (epimerase) deficiency, GALK (galactokinase) deficiency, or a false positive result. There are also other rare conditions, such as portosystemic venous shunting and hepatic arteriovenous malformations, or Fanconi-Bickel Syndrome (GSDXI) that can lead to elevated blood galactose or urinary galactitol, potentially triggering an initial suspicion of galactosemia.Nishimura Y, Tajima G, Dwi Bahagia A, Sakamoto A, Ono H, Sakura N, Naito K, Hamakawa M, Yoshii C, Kubota M, Kobayashi K, Saheki T. Differential diagnosis of neonatal mild hypergalactosaemia detected by mass screening: clinical significance of portal vein imaging. J Inherit Metab Dis. 2004;27(1):11-8. If the NBS result is based only on GALT activity and not on metabolite levels then the differential diagnosis would include classic galactosemia, clinical variant galactosemia, DG, and false positive. Management Historically, there has been no broadly accepted standard of care for infants with DG.Fernhoff, P.M., Duarte galactosemia: how sweet is it? Clin Chem, 2010. 56(7): p. 1045-6. At present, some healthcare providers recommend partial to complete restriction of milk and other high galactose foods for infants with DG; others do not. Because children with DG develop increased tolerance for dietary galactose as they grow, few healthcare providers recommend dietary restriction of galactose beyond early childhood. A revised perspective on clinical care for infants with Duarte galactosemia was published in 2019.McCandless, S. E., 2019. Answering a Question Older Than Most Pediatricians: What to Do About Duarte Variant Galactosemia. Pediatrics, 143(1). doi: 10.1542/peds.2018-3292 The rationale for NOT restricting milk exposure of infants with DG: Healthcare providers who do not recommend dietary restriction of milk for infants with DG generally consider DG to be of no clinical significance‚Äîmeaning most infants and children with DG seem to be doing clinically well. A large study reported in 2019 supported this conclusion. Further, these providers may be opposed to interrupting or reducing breastfeeding when there is no clear evidence it is contraindicated. These providers may argue that the recognized health benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the potential risks of as yet unknown negative effects of continued milk exposure for these infants. For infants with DG who continue to drink milk, some doctors recommend that blood galactose-1-phosphate (Gal-1P) or urinary galactitol be rechecked by age 12 months to ensure that these metabolite levels are normalizing. The rationale FOR restricting milk exposure of infants with DG: Healthcare providers who recommend partial or complete dietary restriction of milk for infants with DG generally cite concern about the unknown long-term consequences of abnormally elevated galactose metabolites in a young child's blood and tissues. Infants with DG who continue to drink milk accumulate the same set of abnormal galactose metabolites seen in babies with classic galactosemia ‚Äì e.g. galactose, Gal-1P, galactonate, and galactitolFicicioglu, C., et al., Monitoring of biochemical status in children with Duarte galactosemia: utility of galactose, galactitol, galactonate, and galactose 1-phosphate. Clin Chem, 2010. 56(7): p. 1177-82. ‚Äì but to a lesser extent. While it remains unclear whether any of these metabolites contribute to the long-term developmental complications experienced by so many older children with classic galactosemia, the theoretical possibility that they might cause problems in children with DG serves to motivate some healthcare providers to recommend dietary galactose restriction for infants with DG. Switching an infant with DG from milk or milk formula (high galactose) to a low-galactose formula rapidly normalizes their galactose metabolites. This approach is considered potentially preventative rather than responsive to symptoms. Of course, if a baby with DG, like any other baby, shows acute signs of milk sensitivity then switching the baby to a non-dairy formula would be responsive to those acute symptoms. If a baby with DG is switched to a low-galactose diet due to concern about elevated galactose metabolites, the healthcare provider may recommend a galactose challenge to re-evaluate galactose tolerance before the restrictive diet is discontinued. Most infants or young children with DG who are followed by a metabolic specialist are discharged from follow up after a successful galactose challenge. What is a galactose challenge? The goal of a galactose challenge is to learn whether a child is able to metabolize dietary galactose sufficiently to prevent the abnormal accumulation of galactose metabolites, generally measured as Gal-1P in the blood or galactitol in the urine. For infants with DG who showed elevated galactose metabolites at diagnosis, this test can be used to see if the child's ability to process galactose has improved. For example, to test galactose metabolism, a baseline Gal-1P level is measured while the child is on a galactose-restricted diet. If the level is within the normal range (e.g. <1.0 mg/dL), the parent/guardian is advised to challenge their child with dietary galactose‚Äîmeaning feed the child a diet that includes normal levels of milk and dairy for 2‚Äì4 weeks. Immediately after that time, another blood sample is collected and analyzed for Gal-1P level. If this second result is still in the normal range, the child is said to have passed their galactose challenge, and dietary galactose restrictions are typically relaxed or discontinued. If the second test shows elevated Gal-1P levels, the parent/guardian may be advised to resume galactose restriction for the child, and the challenge may be repeated after a few months. Prognosis Until recently, very little was known about outcomes in DG after early childhood. This was because many infants with DG were born in states where they were not diagnosed by NBS, and of those who were diagnosed, most were discharged from metabolic follow-up as toddlers. It was therefore unclear whether older children with DG were at increased risk for long-term developmental problems, and also unclear whether long-term developmental outcomes in DG might be modified by exposure to milk in the first year of life. Of note, premature ovarian insufficiency, a common outcome among girls and women with classic galactosemia, was checked by hormone studies of girls with DG and demonstrated not to be a problem.Badik, J.R., et al., Ovarian function in Duarte galactosemia. Fertil Steril, 2011. 96(2): p. 469-473 e1. Prior Research Concerning Developmental Outcomes of Children with DG: Four studies of developmental outcomes of children with DG have been published. *The firstFicicioglu, C., et al., Duarte (DG) galactosemia: a pilot study of biochemical and neurodevelopmental assessment in children detected by newborn screening. Mol Genet Metab, 2008. 95(4): p. 206-12. report published in 2008 was a pilot study that looked at biochemical markers and developmental outcomes in a group of 28 toddlers and young children with DG, some of whom had drunk milk through infancy and some of whom had drunk low-galactose formula. The authors found that galactose metabolites were significantly elevated in the infants drinking milk over those drinking low-galactose formula. However, all of the children scored within the normal range on standardized tests of child development. *The second studyPowell KK, Van Naarden Braun K, Singh RH, Shapira SK, Olney RS, Yeargin-Allsopp M. Long-term speech and language developmental issues among children with Duarte galactosemia. Genet Med. 2009 Dec;11(12):874-9. doi: 10.1097/GIM.0b013e3181c0c38d. published in 2009 looked at 3-to-10 year-olds living in the greater Atlanta area and asked whether children diagnosed as newborns with DG in this group were more likely than the general population to receive special educational services in school. The answer was yes. Specifically, 5 of the 59 children with DG in this group had received special educational services for speech/language; this proportion was higher than that reported for the local population. *The third report, published in 2015, was a very small pilot study involving direct assessments of 15 children, all ages 6‚Äì11 years old; 15 had DG and 5 did not.Lynch ME, Potter NL, Coles CD, Fridovich-Keil JL. Developmental Outcomes of School-Age Children with Duarte Galactosemia: A Pilot Study. JIMD Rep. 2015;19:75-84. doi: 10.1007/8904_2014_370. Epub 2015 Feb 15. Children in the DG group showed slower auditory processing than did the control group. The DG group also showed some slight differences in auditory memory, receptive language/ listening skills, social-emotional functioning, balance, and fine motor coordination. *The final report addressing developmental outcomes of children with Duarte galactosemia published in 2019, looked at 350 children, ages 6‚Äì12 years old: 206 with DG and 144 controls. Of the children with DG, about 40% drank milk as infants and about 60% drank low-galactose formula. The researchers conducted direct assessments in 5 developmental domains for all children yielding 73 outcome scores that were tested for possible association with DG. The ‚Äútop 10‚Äù outcomes were also tested for possible association with milk exposure among study participants with DG. The results clearly demonstrated no significant association of scores for any of the developmental outcomes tested with DG status. The results also demonstrated no significant association of scores for outcomes tested with dietary exposure to milk in infancy among the children with DG in the study. To the limits of the study, these results demonstrate that children with DG are not at increased risk for developmental problems, and that milk exposure in infancy does not lead to developmental problems later in childhood. Epidemiology The prevalence of DG in the United States (US) can only be estimated because there is no true population surveillance for this condition. Differences in NBS methods result in very different detection rates in different states. For example, in some US states, DG is detected by NBS in up to 1 in 3500 infants screened, while in other states it is essentially not detected. DG prevalence in the US population is estimated to be approximately 1 in 4,000, which is more than 10 times the prevalence of classic galactosemia. Of note, because of different allele frequencies for the G and D2 GALT alleles in different human populations,Carney et al. Origins, distribution and expression of the Duarte-2 (D2) allele of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. Hum Mol Genet. 2009 May 1;18(9):1624-32. doi: 10.1093/hmg/ddp080. Epub 2009 Feb 18. DG is found predominantly among infants of European ancestry and only very rarely among infants of African or Asian ancestry.

History  The house was constructed between 1599 and 1602 according to plans by a local architect Anthonis van Obberghen. Initially it housed rooms for the Lutheran clergy serving in the nearby St. Catherine's Church. The fa√ßade, one of the very few in the area to survive World War II, is divided into three distinct parts, which make the building look like three identical, yet separate town houses. This made the large building fit better with the surrounding narrow mediaeval town houses. It was a common feature of many of van Obberghen's projects, notably the Grand Armoury and the Green Gate. In front of the fa√ßade stands a characteristic gilded railing. The three parts of the fa√ßade are tied together by an inscription in the German language running right below the tops, reading \\"DIE AVF DEN HERRN HARREN KRIEGEN NEVE KRAFT DASS SIE AVFFAHREN MIT FLVEGELN WIE ADLER\\" (). On 27 February 1967 the building was listed in the cultural heritage register. It was fully restored and reconstructed in 1970. Currently it houses the Regional Endocrinological Health Centre.

It is run by The Local Taphouse beer bars each year in Melbourne and Sydney and in 2015, almost 23,000 people attended the events. The Local Taphouses regularly run beer festivals, or SpecTAPulars, to showcase rare or exclusive beers under a different theme. The original GABS (it was originally called the Great Australian Beer SpecTAPular) was held at both venues in both Sydney and Melbourne on 12 February 2011. Another notable, annual event is the GABS Hottest 100 Aussie Craft Beers of the Year countdown. This event is held each Australia Day, January 26. The main idea behind GABS was to invite leading Australian craft breweries to brew a special beer just for the event. Not especially confident, Taphouse owners Steve Jeffares and Guy Greenstone thought they would be lucky to get ten new beers so planned to put their favourite Australian beers on the 10 other available taps. The response from brewers was so positive that, ultimately, 22 breweries produced 20 brand new beers for the event. Emboldened by the events' initial success, it was decided to relocate GABS to the Royal Exhibition Building in Melbourne for three days the following year and become part of Melbourne's Good Beer Week celebrations. About 8000 people attended. GABS now features hundreds of beers, brewery stands, beer education, local food vendors and entertainment but it is predominantly known for the GABS 'Festival Beers' which are brewed especially for the event by leading brewers in Australia, New Zealand and other invited international brewers. The first GABS Sydney took place at the Australian Technology Park on Saturday 30 May 2016. In 2015, American magazine, Beer Connoisseur, rated GABS as one of the top 20 beer festivals in the world.

Kresse from 1946 until 1964. The stories featured a Viking king, Eric, and his adventures overseas. Together with Kapitein Rob and Tom Poes, Eric de Noorman is widely considered to belong to the Big Three in Dutch comics history.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kresse.htm Kresse's well documented stories and high quality drawing are praised and have influenced many other European comics artists. Eric de Noorman is one of the few Dutch comics to gain popularity in foreign translations. In the Netherlands, it was published in Het Vaderland, De Nieuwe Haarlemsche Courant and Tom Poes Weekblad, in Flanders in Het Laatste Nieuws and De Nieuwe Gazet, in Wallonia in Le Soir.http://www.ericdenoorman.nl/eric-de-noorman/dagbladen/ The comic has been translated into French, Danish, Finnish, German, Spanish, Swedish, Portuguese and English.http://www.ericdenoorman.nl/eric-de-noorman/vertalingen/ From 1948 on the stories were published in oblong format books at the low price of 75 cent. Concept Eric de Noorman is set during a vague Viking Age. Eric is a young Norse Viking king who lives together with his wife, Winonah, and son Erwin. Pum-Pum, a midget servant, is his trusty aid and advisor. He often travels abroad which brings him into all kinds of fights and adventures. In the earliest stories Eric is both seen in the Roman Empire as well as the Dark Ages of the Middle Ages. In one story he fights against Roman Emperor Commodus (177-192) in the arena. Afterwards he returns to Norway, where he is in the presence of noblemen living in castles in fashions that are more reminiscent of the 12th and 13th centuries. Apart from these anachronisms, Kresse also used a lot of fantasy elements, such as Norse mythology and the Isle of Atlantis. From the story De Witte Raaf (\\"The White Raven\\") on, Kresse used more documentation which made the stories more historically accurate. He set the stories in a specific time period, namely the 5th century. This allowed Eric to meet historical and mythological characters such as the British king Vortigern (Vitalinus), King Arthur, Attila the Hun and Flavius Aetius. Apart from historical accuracy Kresse also drew real-life locations such as Hadrian's Wall, Stonehenge, the menhir field of Carnac and the Mousa Broch. The more magical elements disappeared from the series.http://www.ericdenoorman.nl/eric-de-noorman/eric-s-reizen/ Originally Kresse followed scripts by Dirk Huizinga and Waling Dijkstra, but he eventually went his own way.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kresse.htm List of charactershttp://www.ericdenoorman.nl/personages/ * Eric: A young noble, intelligent and brave Norse king * Winonah: Eric's beloved wife. * Erwin: Eric's son. * Pum-Pum: Eric's trusty midget servant. * Yark: A bad- tempered Norwegian nobleman. * Halfra: A nobleman who is very aware of his blue blood. * Axe the Archer: Both a friend as well as a rival to Erwin. * Aranrod: Axe's wife and queen of Harragh. * Orm: The navigator. He is very pessimistic about the outcome of every adventure. * Ragnar the Red: A pirate captain who can't be trusted. * Cendrach: An old, but reliable builder of ships. * Branwen: Cendrach's daughter. * Svein Longtooth: A Saxon warrior who likes fighting. * Baldon: Eric's archenemy * Lauri: A magician who is Eric's second archenemy Publication history In total about 67 Eric stories were published between 1946 and 1964. All of them were drawn in the text comic format, which was the dominant comic strip genre in the Netherlands until deep into the 1950s. Some stories of Eric have been published with text balloons for publication too. Since the 1970s publishing company Panda has republished all stories chronologically and integrally. Historian Rob van Eijck, a fan of the series, wrote the introductions to these volumes. From 1966 to 1974 Kresse drew a spin-off series, Erwin de Noorman, about Eric's son Erwin. These stories were published with text balloons.https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kresse.htm Translations Eric de Noorman was translated in several languages.http://www.ericdenoorman.nl/eric- de-noorman/vertalingen/ * Danish: Erik Vidfare (published in the magazine Kong Kylie ) * English: Eric the Norseman * French: Eric, l'Homme du Nord (Belgium), Eric le Brave (France) (published in the Walloon newspaper Le Soir and the French monthly magazine Aventures Boum, V√©cu and Pierrot Champion) * German: Erik, der Wikinger (published in Boni Bilderpost) * Portuguese: Erico, Homem do Norte * Spanish Erik, El Hombre del Norte * Swedish: Erik Vidfare (published in the magazines Vecko Nytt and √Öret Runt) Adaptations In 1949 Riny Blaaser adapted the comic strip into a play. https://www.lambiek.net/artists/k/kresse.htm In popular culture Eric de Noorman was first published in the Flemish newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws.

Willy Vandersteen was a fan of the series and used it as an inspiration to his own realistically drawn adventure stories, such as De Rode Ridder. Dutch comics artist Dick Matena also sees Kresse as a personal hero and published a homage to Eric de Noorman, titled Mijmeringen bij een mythe.Matena, Dick, \\"Mijmeringen bij een mythe\\", Atlas, 2007.

The skeletal remains of Pearce-Stevenson were found in Belanglo State Forest, New South Wales, Australia in 2010. Her daughter Khandalyce Pearce's remains were found near Wynarka, South Australia ( from Belanglo) in July 2015. The two cases were not linked until positive identification was confirmed by DNA testing in October 2015. The mother and daughter were last seen by family in 2008 in Alice Springs, Northern Territory and reported missing in 2009; however, the report was withdrawn. It was discovered Pearce-Stevenson's mobile phone was used for years following her death to send false \\"proof of life\\" messages to family and friends. The mother and child's identities were exploited by third parties to commit social security and other types of identity fraud. On 28 October 2015, Daniel James Holdom, reported to be Pearce-Stevenson's former partner, was arrested in Cessnock, New South Wales, and charged with her murder. On 15 December, he was also charged with the murder of her daughter. On 30 November 2018, he was sentenced to two life sentences for the murders. Belanglo State Forest On 29 August 2010, trail bike riders discovered skeletal human remains in the Belanglo State Forest in New South Wales. Media reports at first linked the killing to serial killer Ivan Milat and the backpacker murders, but later forensic examination found the remains had been left there many years after Milat was jailed in 1996 for the seven murders in the forest. In a 2010 appeal for information, police called the woman \\"Angel\\" after the motif on a T-shirt she was wearing. On 21 October 2015, the bones were identified as the body of Pearce-Stevenson, aged 20, from Alice Springs. Wynarka On 15 July 2015, the remains of a young child surrounded by girl's clothing were discovered by a passing motorist who examined an abandoned suitcase at the side of the Karoonda Highway near Wynarka in the Murray Mallee region of South Australia. From the beginning, investigators believed the child had suffered a violent death several years before the remains had been dumped in the suitcase. It was not until October 2015 that the victim was identified as Pearce, aged two, who, with her mother, had been reported missing from Alice Springs more than five years earlier, in 2009. Linking the events Soon after the discovery of the child's remains, police made a public appeal for information that could help identify her, based on items that were found with the suitcase including children's clothing and a distinctive hand-made quilt. After more than 1,200 calls to Crime Stoppers, one caller was able to identify the quilt as one made by the child's grandmother, who had died in 2012 believing her daughter and granddaughter were living interstate. Positive identification was achieved by comparing DNA extracted from the child's skeletal remains with DNA retained from a neonatal heel prick test. A national DNA search then linked the child's remains with the profile of her mother, the previously unidentified remains found in the Belanglo State Forest. The last confirmed sightings of the mother and daughter before their deaths were on 8 November 2008, when they were stopped by police on the Stuart Highway near Coober Pedy in the far north of South Australia, and in Charnwood, a suburb of Canberra, in December 2008. NSW and SA police conducted a joint investigation, including collaboration with ACT and NT police. Victims Karlie Jade Pearce-Stevenson was born in 1988 in Alice Springs and attended Braitling Primary School and Alice Springs High School. She was a keen netballer. Her mother died in 2012. Pearce-Stevenson's step-father and step-brother still live in Alice Springs. Khandalyce Kiara Pearce was Pearce-Stevenson's daughter. She was born in 2006 in Alice Springs. Pearce-Stevenson is believed to have left Alice Springs with Pearce in 2008 to look for work. Police believe they travelled to Darwin, Adelaide, the Murray and Riverland districts, Victoria and Canberra, and appealed to owners of motels, hotels and caravan parks to check their records in case the pair had stayed at their premises. A missing person report was raised with the Northern Territory Police by Pearce-Stevenson's mother on 4 September 2009. The report was closed on 9 October 2009 after \\"she was reassured Pearce-Stevenson was safe and well, but did not want family contact at that time.\\" Police also believe Pearce-Stevenson was killed in Belanglo Forest on 14 or 15 December 2008, and her daughter was killed sometime later in a different location. Investigators have not revealed details of injuries, or how the pair were killed; however, police said the child died a \\"violent death under terrible circumstances\\". The remains of the two victims were returned to Alice Springs and a funeral service and burial was held in December 2015 with the assistance of funds raised from the public and local government. Identity theft Pearce-Stevenson's mobile phone was used until mid-2011, communicating via text messages to give her family and friends the impression she was alive and well, and to appeal for money. Her bank account was accessed until at least 2012 at locations in four states and territories. Over $90,000 was stolen through the account, including Centrelink family payments and other proceeds of fraud. A woman in a wheelchair, accompanied by a man, impersonated Pearce- Stevenson to staff at a credit union in June 2010 using her identity documents. Another woman impersonated her at a Centrelink office in South Australia the same year, using identity documents for Pearce-Stevenson and her daughter. The woman had her leg amputated as a result of a car rollover in 2008 in which Holdom was driving on the Stuart Highway north of Marla. Two of her children were killed in the crash. She reached an out-of-court settlement in May 2016. Suspects Within days of releasing the identities of the victims, police reported they had several suspects, including one in a NSW jail awaiting sentencing on unrelated charges. Arrest On 28 October 2015, 41-year-old Daniel James Holdom was arrested in Cessnock, New South Wales. He was later charged with the murder of Pearce-Stevenson. He was found to be in a relationship with a woman named Hazel Passmore, who allegedly stole Pearce- Stevenson's identity after she was killed and investigators believe the suspect was also involved in a relationship with Pearce-Stevenson. Police allegedly traced a signal from the man's mobile telephone to the location her remains were found in Belanglo Forest at about the time of her death in December. In September 2008, the suspect had been involved in a car accident in which two of his then partner's children were killed. The mother of the children sustained injuries that left her confined to a wheelchair and she is believed to be the same woman who impersonated Pearce-Stevenson at a credit union in 2010. Earlier, in August 2008, the woman had uploaded images of Pearce to her Facebook. The child was photographed in the company of her own children at a motor-show in Alice Springs. On 15 December 2015, Holdom was arrested again in Cessnock for the murder of Pearce. Described as a very violent death, investigators allege Pearce was murdered only a few days after her mother. An officer involved in the investigation remarked it was fortunate the suspect was already in custody as it had allowed police to take time to conduct a \\"thorough and comprehensive investigation\\". Holdom was charged at Parramatta Local Court and refused bail. His case was adjourned until 28 January 2016, when his trial was intended to take place at the Central Law Courts of Sydney. The case was further adjourned to March as the police and prosecutors were still collating the brief of evidence, and only about one third of it had been provided to the defence lawyers. It was adjourned again in September 2016 to at least November due to evidence being collected in a total of five jurisdictions. Committal hearing During his committal hearing in August 2017, it was alleged that Holdom had told a witness he stepped on Pearce-Stevenson's throat, crushed her windpipe and buried her body in the Belanglo forest. It was also alleged he stopped at a supermarket and bought duct tape and garbage bags before he suffocated Pearce in a motel in Narrandera, stuffed her body in a suitcase, and dumped it in Wynarka where it remained for nearly seven years. His first appearance in the Supreme Court of New South Wales was on 1 December 2017. His trial was expected to take three months from 6 August 2018, however on 31 July 2018, Holdom pleaded guilty to the murders. His sentencing, originally set for 29 September, was moved to 9 November, where he faced two life sentences. The brutality of the murders was publicly revealed following his guilty plea. Holdom also had a prior history of violence against women and an interest in sexual violence toward children. A police fact sheet tendered to the court cited evidence of a sexual motive to the murder of the child. Bruce Pearce, Pearce-Stevenson's father and Pearce's grandfather, gave a written statement during the sentencing, expressing his desire for a death sentence against Holdom. New South Wales abolished the death penalty for murder in 1955. Prosecutor Mark Tedeschi described the murders as a \\"thrill killing\\", and said \\"Both murders fall within the worst case and can aptly be described as atrocious, detestable, hateful, gravely reprehensible and extremely wicked\\".McPhee, Sarah; AAP \\"Father to killer: Death penalty not enough for ‚Äòextremely wicked‚Äô murderer\\" (News.com.au), 28 September 2018. Retrieved 30 November 2018 Sentence On 30 November 2018, Holdom was sentenced in the NSW Supreme Court to two consecutive life sentences without parole for the murders.

It was formed in 1956 following a split in the National Unionist Party (NUP). Those who left the NUP to form the PDP were largely members of the Khatmiyya Sufi order. After a period of siding with the Umma party, the PDP would later realign with the NUP, and the two parties merged in 1968 to form the Democratic Unionist Party.  Background  The National Unionist Party had been founded in 1953 from supporters of Ismail al-Azhari, and members of the Khatmiyya Sufi order. These two factions sat uneasily with each other, and had been brought together as much for tactical reasons as for ideological cohesion. The initial Azhari- Khatmiyya alliance had come about because the Azhari led urban nationalists lacked a wide enough base to achieve electoral success alone, and had found greater cause with the Khatmiyya than with the Mahdiyya, who would form the Umma party. Split from the NUP Despite their union however, the Azhari faction and the Khatmiyya faction lacked ideological cohesion, and this internal divide would form the basis of the split, which saw 21 members of the ruling NUP leaving to form the People's Democratic Party in June 1956.

Born in the 1840s in England, she and her adoptive mother, Ann Hindle, migrated to New York City in 1868. Hall performed as a male impersonator in solo acts and in minstrel shows from 1868 to 1886.  Early life  Annie Hindle was born in England in the mid-1840s and adopted by Ann Hindle. Annie Hindle had an affinity for both singing and wearing men's clothes at an early age and began performing on the musical stage at the age of six. Hindle and her mother moved to the United States in 1868.  Male impersonation career  Hindle performed as a male impersonator on the American variety stage from 1868 and 1886 and received high reviews and steady bookings. Her skills in male impersonation astounded her audience. A review of one of her performances at the Adelphi Theater in Galveston, Texas, noted, \\"Annie Hindle has proved a great success. As a male impersonator her sex is so concealed that one is apt to imagine that it is a man who is singing.\\"  Personal life  Hindle's first marriage was to Charles Vivian, a ballad singer and founder of a theatrical fraternity. They married in 1868, but separated with no legal divorce six months later. Hindle later stated that Vivian had abused her during their relationship. In 1878, some newspapers reported that Hindle married minstrel performer W.W. Long, although no official records can confirm this. In addition, the pair never lived or traveled together. In 1886, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Hindle married her dresser Annie Ryan while on a tour through the mid-west. Hindle dressed in male clothing and gave her name as Charles and a local Baptist minister performed the ceremony. Hindle continued to work the stage. After Ryan's death in 1891, she married another young woman, Louise Spangehl.

Events create murals in various kinds of locations, which can include public spaces such as subways. However, there have been conflicts with authorities during and even after events. Organization and events Graffiti artists working on a piece in the historic center of Mexico City at the 2015 event Meeting of Styles refers to an international network of graffiti artists and fans, which exists to gain legitimacy for graffiti artists and their work. Internationally it is a non-profit organization, with local affiliates which sponsor graffiti events, and is one of the most important organizations of its type in the world. Events have been held in over sixteen countries in Europe, Russian Asia and the Americas. The events are announced ahead of time with flyers, press releases to the general public as well as the graffiti artist community, and attracts spectators, local media as well as graffiti artists. These events attract veteran graffiti and well-known artists, who have often gained their reputation with illegal works, from countries such as Spain, Germany, Brazil, the United States, Canada, Costa Rica and the United Kingdom. These events are not only for graffiti but also supports other kinds of street art. Spaces for murals and other works range from temporary walls on construction sites to walls inside the Mexico City Metro. However, the organizing of local events is challenged by local politics, with various levels of support, and the need for sponsors.

Each week Lubach talks for half an hour about the news of the past week through various fragments from the media infographics and investigative journalism. The show's main scriptwriters are Tex de Wit and Pieter Jouke. The program is recorded in the main auditorium of the Theater Bellevue in Amsterdam. On August 19, 2020, Arjen Lubach revealed the program will stop. Notable stunts =Pharaoh of the Netherlands (2015)= Arjen Lubach is a strong opponent of the monarchy of the Netherlands. Out of protest against the monarchy, he came up with a citizens initiative, in which he crowned himself \\"Pharaoh of the Netherlands\\", which, like 'King' is also a hereditary title. At the time of the airing of the show in which he introduced his initiative, it was 200 years since William I proclaimed himself a King of the Netherlands. For the citizens initiative Lubach needed a minimum of 40.000 endorsements, which he obtained while he was a guest at the Dutch talk show De Wereld Draait Door. With the minimum of 40.000 endorsements, the House of Representatives was obliged to talk about the initiative. =Donald Trump video (2017)= Zondag met Lubach inspired the global video contest Every Second Counts after it broadcast the parody video \\"The Netherlands welcomes Trump in his own words\\" on 22 January 2017. In the video, Donald Trump's speeches and actions ‚Äìmostly from his election campaign‚Äì are imitated and mocked by voice actor Greg Shapiro, who gives a short description of the Netherlands using some self-mockery as well, finishing with the request that the Netherlands may come 'second' if America is to be 'first'. A semi-serious undertone is formed by fears that Trump's announced \\"America First\\" policy signifies isolationism, including withdrawing U.S. support for NATO: \\"If you screw NATO, you're gonna make our problems great again.\\" The video went viral, being discussed by multiple international newsmedia and reaching over 73 million views worldwide by 3 February. On 2 February during Neo Magazin Royale, Jan B√∂hmermann challenged the Dutch's second place, broadcasting a rival video that claimed 'Germany second' whilst making fun of the Netherlands and Germany itself as well. Then, he encouraged other satirical talkshow producers in all European countries to make similar videos parodying Trump, themselves and challenging the Netherlands' second place behind America. Production teams in at least eleven other countries committed to making their own parody videos, and by 3 February, versions for Belgium (by De Ideale Wereld), Switzerland (by Deville Late Night), Denmark (by Natholdet), Portugal (by 5 Para A Meia-Noite) and Lithuania (by Laikykitƒós ten) had been released; these would all be gathered on the website everysecondcounts.eu. =Westeros the Series (2017)= In late August 2017, a YouTube channel named \\"Westeros The Series\\" uploaded a \\"trailer\\" for Westeros, a new 'television series' that would be set in a modern-day Westeros after the events of Game of Thrones, and would premiere in 2019. After getting attention from media, including The Daily Telegraph and Vice, the channel uploaded another video on YouTube in early September 2017, instead revealing that Zondag met Lubach would return on 10 September 2017. Zondag met Lubachs official YouTube channel also uploaded a combined version of the 'trailer'. =Nonsensical Rifle Addiction (2017)= On 8 October 2017, one week after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Zondag met Lubach aired a spoof advertisement called \\"Nonsensical Rifle Addiction\\", which highlighted the issue with gun violence and mass shootings in the United States, and also lampooned the United States's inability to introduce any binding form of gun control. The title is a play on the influential American gun rights organisation National Rifle Association (NRA). The video was retweeted by American actor Samuel L. Jackson after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018.This Dutch video about America's nonsensical rifle addiction hits the nail on the head, bustle.com. Awards =Zilveren Nipkowschijf (2016)= The show's social media profile icon Theater Bellevue in Amsterdam, where the show takes place On 10 June 2016 Zondag met Lubach won the Zilveren Nipkowschijf. The winner of the prize is chosen by a jury consisting out of newspapers and magazines television critics. The year before, Zondag met Lubach received an honorable mention by the jury =Gouden Televizier-Ring (2017)= Best Television show During the Televizier-Ring Gala on 11 October 2017, Zondag met Lubach was awarded the Gouden Televizier-Ring (Golden television ring) for \\"Best television program\\". Zondag met Lubach got a plurality of the vote with 47%. During the airing of the award show people could vote for one of the three nominees for \\"Best television program\\". The two other nominees were Beste Zangers and Expeditie Robinson. Arjen Lubach started off his acceptance speech with saying \\"Wat ontzettend terecht\\", meaning \\"How very much deserved\\" (meant as a joke). Furthermore, he praised the rest of his team and acknowledged their importance. This was the first time that a vpro-program won the prize. To get people to vote for Zondag met Lubach during the show, Arjen Lubach had an advert placed on the Ziggo Dome. In this advert the presenters of Beste zangers and Expeditie Robinson were urging people to vote for Zondag met Lubach. Lubach later thanked the presenters. This initially angered some people, because they thought that the advert was paid for with tax money. However, Lubach later said that this was not the case, but that he knew a few people who could get this done. Best actor To gain the attention of his viewers about the nomination for best actor, Lubach talked about it on his show, however he didn't talk about his own nomination. Instead, he talked about Erik de Vogel, who got nominated in the category for best actor. He requested people to vote for De Vogel, together with a catchphrase \\"Ludo verdient een kudo\\" meaning Ludo (name of the actor's role in Goede tijden, slechte tijden) deserves kudos. De Vogel did however not win the award, as it was given to Jeroen van Koningsbrugge instead.

The Marching Scarlet Knights performs at all home Rutgers Scarlet Knights football games. The band also travels to select regular season and post season football games.

However, instructors and funding for the marching band still originated in the military. The band struggled to retain members throughout World War II. As a part of the military, band members and directors were often called into active duty. Around 1948, the band shifted from traditional military uniforms and style to a more casual ‚ÄúIvy League‚Äù style, in which members wore straw hats, crimson sport coats, black ties, black slacks, and white shoes. Under the direction of Casomir Bork during the 1960s, the band began having a band camp prior to the marching season. During the same time period, the band also began transitioning from the Ivy League style back to a more traditional style, modeled from the Michigan Marching Band. In 1966, Scott Whitener became the first full-time director of the Marching Scarlet Knights. In 1968, the band officially changed from a military band to an athletic band. While football games were the main focus, the marching band also served as a pep band for home basketball games. Soon after the band's transition, Rutgers University began offering course credit for marching band. At the time, the Marching Scarlet Knights band was known as the ‚ÄúRutgers Marching One Hundred.‚Äù When Rutgers University began admitting women to the school in 1972, women were also allowed to join the Marching Scarlet Knights. Disputes among students arose while integrating women into the marching band, and internal problems led to the disbanding of the local chapter of the band fraternity Kappa Kappa Psi. In the 1980s, William Berz changed the style of the band once again. He gradually transitioned the band from marching with high knees to a more modern glide step, in which band members keep straight legs, with their feet staying close to the ground. The 1990s marked a time of constant change for the band. Six different directors led the band throughout the decade. Marching band enrollment decreased significantly during this time period. Then, in 2001, Rutgers University hired Timothy Smith as the band's director. As a combined result of a lasting band director and the Rutgers football team's newfound success, band enrollment began to increase again. In July 2017, Todd Nichols took over from Smith as the director of the Marching Scarlet Knights. Personnel The Marching Scarlet Knights has eleven instrumental sections; Piccolos, clarinets, alto saxophones, tenor saxophones, trumpets, mellophones, trombones, baritones, sousaphones, a front ensemble, and a drum line. The front ensemble was added in 2018 and includes keyboard percussion, a synthesizer, a drum set, electric bass , and non-pitched percussion. The band also features a color guard as well as multiple twirlers and a field major. =Drum Majors and Field Major= Unlike in many Big Ten marching bands, the position of drum major is separated from the role of field major. The field major is a performance oriented role that includes leading the band in parade block as well as performing a choreographed routine during the pregame show. This performance includes mace work as well as the traditional collegiate back bend. The current field major is Mike Berliner. The position of drum major is the highest available leadership role in the Marching Scarlet Knights. The drum majors are responsible for conducting the band during rehearsal and performances, as well as heavily contributing to the day-to-day operations of the band including equipment, treasury, and general organization of student leadership. The current drum majors of the band are Harrison Farrugia, Kyle Gelatka, and Jessica Morley. https://www.rutgersbands.com/news =The Scarlet Girl= The \\"Scarlet Girl\\" is the featured baton twirler of the Marching Scarlet Knights. Like the field major, the Scarlet Girl performs a choreographed routine during the traditional pregame show. The current Scarlet Girl is Tianha Selby. https://www.rutgersbands.com/twirling =Past directors= *Leigh Kimball *Charles W. Cook (1927-1939) *Warrant Officer Vernon W.

It is a recently discovered hexokinase isoform that likely phosphorylates glucose in maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Structure The HKDC1 gene is oriented in a head-to-tail arrangement next to the HK1 gene on chromosome 10. This arrangement, along with its amino acid sequence similarity to HK1, suggests that HKDC1 and HK1 derived from the same precursor via a tandem gene duplication event. The similarity between HKDC1 and HK1 may have obscured its discovery in earlier screens for vertebrate hexokinases. Unlike the HK2 pseudogene, HKDC1 contains an intact open reading frame of 917 residues and is conserved across animal species, indicating that it encodes a functional protein. Moreover, the encoded protein contains conserved glucose-binding sites in its N- and C-terminal domains as well as an ATP-binding site in its C-terminal domain, indicating that its C-terminal is capable of hexokinase activity.  Function  As the recently identified fifth isoform of hexokinase, HKDC1 catalyzes the rate-limiting and first obligatory step of glucose metabolism, which is the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose to G6P. Though its particular biological function remains unclear, HKDC1 has been suggested to play a more major role in glucose metabolism during pregnancy, as the mother would need to provide enough energy for both herself and the fetus. HKDC1 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest levels of expression in pharynx, thymus, colon, esophagus, and eye tissue. Clinical Significance =Cancer= Compared to the other hexokinases, HKDC1 was dramatically overexpressed in cancer tissues, indicating that this isoform might play an important and different role in cancer growth. Further experiments clarifying this role will be required for developing HKDC1 as a therapeutic target. =Gestational hyperglycemia= Several regulatory variants, including various enhancers, targeting HKDC1 expression have been associated with gestational hyperglycemia in pregnant women. Considering that maternal glucose levels during pregnancy impact the both fetal and later health outcomes, a greater understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying maternal glycemia during pregnancy may help identify and aid such women at risk.

Soon after the German invasion it was reorganized as a standard rifle division and renumbered as the 304th. It served in the southwestern part of the Soviet- German front for more than a year and a half, fighting under difficult conditions, including the German summer offensive of 1942. The division did not distinguish itself until Operation Uranus in late 1942 and the subsequent Operation Ring, in which it helped defeat the encircled German Sixth Army. In recognition of these successes, even before the German surrender at Stalingrad, it was raised to Guards status as the 67th Guards Rifle Division. A second 304th was raised six months later, based on a pair of rifle brigades, facing the German 17th Army in the Kuban. After helping to liberate this region the division continued in combat through Ukraine and Poland, winning its own distinctions at Zhitomir and an Order of the Red Banner, before ending the war near Prague.  1st Formation  After losing most of its trucks and tanks in its first battles near Kiev, the 109th Mechanized DivisionSharp designates this as a mechanized division, while Glantz designates it as motorized. of 5th Mechanized Corps began moving back to Zolotonosha, east of the Dniepr River, to reform as the 304th Rifle Division on July 12, 1941.Walter S. Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys to Victory, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2007, p. 77 Its order of battle was revised to the following: * 807th Rifle Regiment - newly formed from reserves and added to replace the 16th Tank Regiment * 809th Rifle Regiment - from 381st Motorized Rifle Regiment * 812th Rifle Regiment - from 602nd Motorized Rifle Regiment * 560th Artillery Regiment - from 404th Motorized Artillery RegimentCharles C.

Timofei Ilich Sidorenko, but he was replaced after about six weeks by Maj. Gen. Nikolai Pavlovich Pukhov. After several weeks in Southwestern Front reserves, the 304th was assigned to the 38th Army in early August, just as that Army was itself forming up. The division remained in that Army until July, 1942. It was able to avoid encirclement near Kiev as it was located just east of the point where 1st Panzer Group broke through the Soviet front, and was able to retreat through Poltava.David Stahel, Kiev 1941, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2012, map on pp. 262‚Äì63 In late January, 1942, Maj. Gen. Pukhov was reassigned to command of 13th Army, and was replaced by Col. Ivan Vasilievich Khazov. The division also managed to stay clear of the debacle at Kharkov in May, 1942.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 69 In early June the 304th was facing the difficult task of helping to defend the sector from the Northern Donets River east of Chuguev southwards 60 km to the west of Izium; the division itself was holding the area near Balakleia. As a preliminary to its summer offensive, on June 22 German Army Group South launched Operation Fridericus II to gain control of Izium and Kupiansk, and also to encircle and destroy as much as possible of the Soviet 38th and 9th Armies. The German advance on the latter city was held up by a strenuous defense by 9th Guards Rifle Division, which allowed the 304th and three other divisions to escape encirclement and join 38th Army's new line behind the Oskol without serious losses. It was in these positions when Operation Blue began.David M. Glantz, To the Gates of Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 91, 96, 98-102, 111 =Operation Blue= 38th Army was directly in the path when the second phase of this offensive began on July 7, and by the 9th was in deep trouble. Maj. Gen. Kirill Moskalenko, the Army's commander, sent urgent messages to the STAVKA requesting permission to withdraw well east of the Aidar River to prevent his forces being entirely cut off. When no reply was forthcoming, he ordered the retreat on his own authority. While the 304th suffered significant casualties in this retreat, and German intelligence counted it as one of the divisions that had been \\"bagged\\", Moskalenko's order saved enough to allow it to be rebuilt.Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 178-79 On July 31, Col. Serafim Petrovich Merkulov took command of the division, and would hold it for the remainder of the 1st Formation's existence. Shortly before this the 304th was moved to the 21st Army, under the newly formed Stalingrad Front. In August, as the defense of Stalingrad was being planned, the division was assigned to hold part of its Army's 140 km-wide sector from the mouth of the Khoper River as far as Melo- Kletsky.Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 276, 304, 310, 329 In mid-August, after German 6th Army had cleared the great bend of the Don River and was clearly preparing for an advance on Stalingrad, Col. Gen. Andrey Yeryomenko conceived a plan to distract the German forces from this objective. On August 19 he issued an attack order to 21st and 63rd Armies to cross the Don southwards in the 30 km sector west of Serafimovich. Most of this sector had been taken up by elements of the Italian 8th Army within the past week, although they still had some backup from the Germans. The 304th, along with the 96th Rifle Division, were to play 21st Army's part in this offensive, attacking on a 15 km sector from Serafimovich to the Khoper. In the event, the 96th had no success against the German forces in Serafimovich itself in the early going, but the 304th managed to establish a small bridgehead, and over the following days pushed forwards 7 km and began digging in on August 27, while the 96th liberated Serafimovich. The gains made by 63rd Army were more extensive, and together these created one of the bridgeheads across the Don which would play an important role in Operation Uranus.Glantz, Gates of Stalingrad, pp. 383-89 The division, in company with the 124th Rifle Division, launched a heavy diversionary attack against the 79th Infantry Division on September 4 with the objective of tying down German forces in the region.Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, p. 46 =Operation Uranus= In October the division was reassigned to 65th Army in Don Front as that Army was being organized.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 69 In Maj. Gen. P.I. Batov's plan for the offensive in November, the 304th formed half of the Army's shock group, alongside the 27th Guards Rifle Division, on a 6 km-wide sector on the south bank of the Don between Kletskaia and Melo-Kletskii. This bridgehead had been won from the Germans by the 1st Guards Army in August. The attack began on the morning of November 19 with a massive artillery barrage. Between 0848 and 0850 hrs. Moscow time, riflemen and sappers of the leading battalions, bolstered by 49 tanks of the 91st Tank Brigade, commenced the assault, aimed at the boundary between 1st Romanian Cavalry and the German 376th Infantry Divisions. The immediate objective was to smash the Romanian cavalry, then attack southeastward to turn the flank of 6th Army's XI Corps and protect the left flank of 21st Army's mobile group as it exploited southwards. General Batov recorded: The 304th had encountered skillfully fortified strongpoints manned by German troops that they could not overcome. Further, they faced nearly constant counterattacks from 376th Infantry, supported later in the day by elements of 14th Panzer Division.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book One, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 194, 197, 206-08 One of these strongpoints was the village of Orekhovsky, which was attacked repeatedly through the day with tank support with only minimal success. However, a single battalion of the 807th Rifle Regiment, commanded by Major Chebotaev, managed to capture Marker 202.2 on the high ground just 2 km west of the village's center. Overnight, Batov and his staff worked out a new plan to exploit this limited success. A mobile group was formed, made up of about 45 T-34 and KV tanks from 91st Brigade, with submachine gunners riding on their decks, accompanied by motorized infantry and artillery. This force came under the command of Col. G.I. Anisimov on the morning of November 20 and was ready to advance in the early afternoon, following the rifle forces that were developing the 807th Regiment's penetration. Diversionary attacks were made by 65th Army's left- flank forces, while the 304th continued its assault on Orekhovsky and another strongpoint at Logovsky. This would be assisted by the fresh 252nd Rifle Division entering the battle at the boundary between the 304th and the 27th Guards. During the morning these two divisions pushed deeply into the Romanian defenses, after which the 252nd created a breach which Anisimov's mobile group entered and began its exploitation, advancing 23 km into XI Corps' left rear by nightfall, sowing panic and helping convince the German Corps that its position was becoming untenable. Meanwhile, the three rifle divisions advanced 2 to 4 km to the southeast, and on the following day completed the liberation of Orekhovsky, as well as Logovsky and Osinki.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 239-42 On November 21 the advance of the division and its neighbors became more difficult as the 376th Infantry consolidated its positions and was gradually reinforced. Despite the slow progress on this sector, over the next two days Southwestern and Stalingrad Fronts completed the encirclement of German 6th Army, and the mission of Don Front changed to that of liquidating the enemy pocket. 65th Army resumed its advance early on November 25. XI Corps, reinforced with elements of XIV Panzer Corps, began to pull back southeast across the Don, giving up its bridgehead in the Great Bend, which was untenable. Batov began a slow pursuit with his 24th, 304th and 252nd Rifle Divisions; the 304th advanced from Rodionov to Kubantseva Balka, with the support of 91st Tank Brigade. By the end of the day the area of the German bridgehead had been reduced by roughly half. The next day the pursuit continued, and the division reached the northern slope of Hill 204.0, 2 km south of Biriuchkov, before being stopped by heavy fire from the hill. Overnight on November 26/27 the last German forces were withdrawn. Batov wrote:This shock group was led by two battalions of the 812th Rifle Regiment, which made a night crossing of the ice-covered river under protective fire from 91st Tank Brigade. It was a risky move because the ice was not as firm as Batov would have liked, but with the help of the 14th Engineer Brigade the rest of the 304th made it across safely, and the sappers soon erected a bridge. Within 24 hours Vertiachii was taken, as the German forces continued to withdraw to the defensive line designated by 6th Army command several days earlier. Batov then withdrew the division into 65th Army's reserves.Glantz, Endgame, Book One, pp. 283-84, 435-43, 491-92 =Operation Ring= The 304th re-entered the battle at 0700 hrs. on December 2. A reconnaissance group of 27th Guards had found a small gap in the German lines the day before, and the two divisions were tasked to exploit it. The attack, supported by 12 tanks plus antitank guns of the 52nd Tank Destroyer Regiment, against the German 131st Regiment of 44th Infantry Division defending Hill 124.5 (Chernyi Kurgan), advanced several hundred metres after a full day of intense fighting, but fell short of taking the hill. 24th Rifle Division took the lead in a further attack on December 4. The 304th was to support and protect its right flank as it drove on Hill 113.6 and the village of Baburkin, 3 km beyond. Despite significant artillery support the assault made only limited gains. Chernyi Kurgan was taken, and would be a thorn in the side of 44th Division through the coming weeks, but nearly all other gains were erased by German counterattacks. On December 6, in an effort to restore its main battle line, German VIII Army Corps launched several counterattacks against the hill, which 24th Division had turned into a virtual fortress, as well as the Golaia ravine, defended by the 27th Guards and 304th. In fighting that went on into December 8, these gains were held.Glantz, Endgame at Stalingrad, Book Two, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2014, pp. 165-66, 172, 174-75, 178 Through most of the rest of the month the lines surrounding 6th Army became relatively quiet as the Soviet Fronts prepared for Operation Ring. One exception to this pattern occurred on December 28/29, when five divisions of 21st and 65th Armies, including the 304th, launched assault groups against the much-reduced 44th and 376th Infantry Divisions. The former lost 177 men over the two days, while the latter lost 130 men on the 28th and 392 in counterattacks the following day.Glantz, Endgame, Book Two, pp. 354-55 When Ring formally began on January 10, 1943, the division was one of ten in the first echelon of 21st, 65th and 24th Armies that would make Don Front's main attack, facing 44th Infantry and 29th Motorized Divisions. The 304th and 173rd Rifle Divisions, on the right wing of 65th Army, had a long-range artillery group of three army-level regiments, firing in their direct support. After a 55-minute opening barrage the infantry assault began at 0900 hrs., supported by over 100 tanks, and soon overwhelmed the enemy defenses. The 304th and 24th Divisions, led by the KV tanks of the 5th and 14th Guards Tank Regiments,Sharp, \\"Red Storm\\", Soviet Mechanized Corps and Guards Armored Units 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, vol. III, 1995, pp. 78-79 overran the three weak battalions of 44th Infantry's 134th and 132nd Regiments, plus the battalion-sized Group Weller of 29th Motorized along a 4 km-wide sector. The two Soviet divisions advanced 2 km, shattered all four enemy battalions, and opened a 2 km-wide breach of the German line by day's end.Glantz, Endgame, Book Two, pp. 423-25, 436, 440-41 On January 11, Batov exploited this gap by ordering his 23rd Rifle Division straight into it from second echelon and over that day it advanced, along with the 304th, about 3 km, reaching to within 1 km of the Rossoshka valley and, in the process, rendering VIII Corps' defenses west of the Rossoshka completely untenable. In the course of the next day's fighting the division managed to win a 1- to 2 km- wide bridgehead across this river. On the 13th, the 304th, with two other divisions, continued to attack the remaining defenses of 44th Infantry, but made limited gains. The next day the division, in concert with the 23rd, enveloped the 44th's forces defending Novo-Alekseevsky but failed to capture the town; they were later reinforced by 273rd Rifle Division. From January 15 to 17 the pace of the Soviet advance slowed, and Rokossovsky finally called a halt for rest and replenishment.Glantz, Endgame, Book Two, pp. 456-57, 463-64, 472, 477, 490 Before the offensive was officially set to resume, on January 21 65th Army went back to the attack with four divisions, including the 304th, backed again by 91st Tank Brigade, striking eastward, and penetrating the defenses of VIII Corps' 76th Infantry Division. These attacks finished off the 44th Infantry and did severe damage to the 76th, and also created a 6 km-wide gap in 6th Army's western front, bringing divisional artillery within range of Gumrak airfield. In recognition of the accomplishments of the division, late in the day the 304th Rifle Division was re-designated as the 67th Guards Rifle Division.Glantz, Endgame, Book Two, pp. 506-09Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 69  2nd Formation  The second 304th Rifle Division was formed from the 43rd Rifle Brigade and the 256th Rifle Brigade of 9th Rifle Corps,Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 198http://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/943RGCC.PDF , p. 67 on August 1, 1943, in 9th Army in the North Caucasus Front. =43rd Rifle Brigade= The second formation of this brigade took place in August, 1942, in the reserves of Transcaucasus Front by mobilizing training units in the Transcaucasus Military District. Early in October it was assigned to the 58th Army in the Northern Group of its Front. 58th Army was acting as a reserve backing the Terek River line, blocking the German advance on Baku and the Caspian oil fields. At the end of the month the 43rd advanced into the 9th Rifle Corps' positions in 44th Army along the Terek. On November 22, the brigade consisted of: * 4 rifle battalions, each 700-800 men, plus: ** 1 AT rifle section (2 AT rifles) ** 1 machine gun company ** 1 mortar company (6 82mm mortars) ** 1 AT rifle platoon (6 AT rifles) * 1 mortar battalion (24 82mm mortars) * 1 submachine gun company (100-120 men) * 1 \\"assault troop\\" (100-120 men) The lack of artillery and other heavy weapons was typical of the units formed in the region during the crisis of July to September. As the front began to move north and west towards the Kuban the brigade was reassigned to 9th Army in the North Caucasus Front and served there facing the German 17th Army from February to July, 1943, until it was disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", Soviet Militia Units, Rifle and Ski Brigades 1941 - 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. XI, 1996, pp. 28-29 =256th Rifle Brigade= This brigade was formed in February - March, 1942, in the Moscow Military District.Dunn, Jr., Stalin's Keys, p. 106 It was in the Moscow Defense Zone from April to August, when it was railed south to the Transcaucasus Military District. When it arrived it consisted of: * 4 rifle battalions, each: ** 3 rifle companies (123 men each) ** 1 submachine gun company (100 men) ** 1 machine gun company ** 1 mortar company (82mm mortars) ** AT rifle, sapper supply platoons * 1 artillery battalion (20 76mm and 45mm cannon) * 1 antitank battalion (346 men) ** 3 companies (108 antitank rifles total) * 1 sapper company (120 men) * 1 reconnaissance platoon The brigade was commanded by Col. V.S. Antonov. It was quickly assigned to 44th Army, then in September to 9th Army along the Terek River defense line. In November, during the last gasps of the German offensive, the 256th became part of 9th Rifle Corps back in 44th Army, and remained there while the enemy retreat began. In January, 1943, that Corps moved to 9th Army in North Caucasus Front, and the brigade served the next six months facing the German positions on the Taman Peninsula until it was disbanded.Sharp, \\"Red Volunteers\\", pp. 73-74 The order of battle of the new 304th Rifle Division remained as previous.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", Soviet Rifle Divisions Formed From 1942 to 1945, Soviet Order of Battle World War II, Vol. X, 1996, p. 114 The first commander assigned was Col. Timofeiy Ustinovich Grinchenko. After just over one month of forming up, the division was assigned to the 11th Rifle Corps of 9th Army. Advance On September 19 the 304th began operations in the Taman as part of the final offensive to drive German forces from their last foothold in the Kuban. It formed part of a strike group attacking the village of Kurchanskaya, which was taken. On the 25th, in concert with the 316th Rifle Division and following a powerful artillery and air attack, it stormed the city of Temryuk, which was taken two days later after heavy street fighting. The surviving Germans fled to the village of Golubitskaya; the 304th, crossing the Kuban River using improvised means, pursued. On October 9 the entire peninsula was cleared of Axis troops. Two weeks later Colonel Grinchenko was replaced in command by Col. Mikhail Maksimovich Muzikin. In November, 9th Army was disbanded, and its forces were redeployed to other Fronts and Armies. 11th Rifle Corps was railed northwestward, joining 38th Army in 1st Ukrainian Front west of Kiev in December. The 304th would remain in this Front until the last few weeks of the war. During the Zhitomir‚ÄìBerdichev Offensive, the division played an important role in the second liberation of Zhitomir on the last day of 1943, and was awarded the name of that city as an honorific: At this time the division was in the 6th Guards Rifle Corps of 1st Guards Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 281 On March 29, 1944, Col. Ivan Mikhailovich Boldanov took command from Colonel Muzikin, but was in turn replaced by Col. Aleksandr Stepanovich Galtzev on June 3. On April 3, the division was recognized for its role in the liberation of Kamianets-Podilskyi and several other towns with the Order of the Red Banner. On July 21 the 304th was shifted to 52nd Rifle Corps, back in 38th Army, and then in October to 106th Rifle Corps of 60th Army.http://www.cgsc.edu/CARL/nafziger/944RLAA.pdf , p. 1-2 The division remained in that Corps and that Army for the duration. In a final change of command on February 7, 1945, Colonel Galtzev handed over to Col. Khaiyrbek Demirbekovich Zamanov. In the last weeks of the war the 60th Army was transferred to 4th Ukrainian Front, and the 304th ended hostilities in the vicinity of Prague.Sharp, \\"Red Swarm\\", p. 114 The division ended the war with the official name: 304th Rifle, Zhitomir, Order of the Red Banner Division.

Originating from a sprawling disturbance near the Gulf of Tehuantepec, south of Mexico, in mid-October 2015, Patricia was first classified a tropical depression on October 20\\\\. Initial development was slow, with only modest strengthening within the first day of its classification. The system later became a tropical storm and was named Patricia, the twenty-fourth named storm of the annual hurricane season. Exceptionally favorable environmental conditions fueled explosive intensification on October 22\\\\. A well-defined eye developed within an intense central dense overcast and Patricia grew from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane in just 24 hours‚Äîa near-record pace. On October 23, the hurricane achieved its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h). This made it the most intense tropical cyclone on record in the Western Hemisphere and the strongest globally in terms of one-minute maximum sustained winds. Late on October 23, dramatic weakening ensued and Patricia made landfall near Cuixmala, Jalisco, with winds of 150 mph (240 km/h). This made it the strongest landfalling hurricane on record along the Pacific coast of Mexico. Patricia continued to weaken extremely quickly, faster than it had intensified, as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Mexico. Within 24 hours of moving ashore, Patricia weakened into a tropical depression and dissipated soon thereafter, late on October 24\\\\. The precursor to Patricia produced widespread flooding rains in Central America. Hundreds of thousands of people were directly affected by the storm, mostly in Guatemala. At least six fatalities were attributed to the event: four in El Salvador, one in Guatemala, and one in Nicaragua. Torrential rains extended into southeastern Mexico, with areas of Quintana Roo and Veracruz reporting accumulations in excess of . Damage in Chetumal reached MX$1.4 billion (US$85.3 million). As a tropical cyclone, Patricia's effects in Mexico were tremendous; however, the affected areas were predominantly rural, mitigating a potential large-scale disaster. Violent winds tore roofs from structures and stripped coastal areas of their vegetation. Preliminary assessments indicated hundreds of homes to be destroyed; seven fatalities were linked to the hurricane directly or indirectly, including one during evacuations. Total damage from Patricia was estimated to be at least $462.8 million (2015 USD); the damage in Mexico alone was estimated to be in excess of MX$5.4 billion (US$325 million), with agriculture and infrastructure comprising the majority of losses. Flooding partially associated with remnant moisture from Patricia inflicted US$52.5 million in damage across Southern Texas. Meteorological history On October 11, 2015, an area of disturbed weather traversed Central America and emerged over the eastern Pacific Ocean. The disturbance moved slowly over the next few days, later merging with a tropical wave on October 15\\\\. The merger of these systems and the effects of a concurrent Tehuantepec gap wind event spurred the formation of a broad area of low pressure. This feature gradually consolidated and became a tropical depression shortly after 00:00 UTC on October 20; at this time the depression was situated roughly 205 mi (335 km) south-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. A mid-level ridge to the north steered the depression generally west and later pulled it north along an arcing path. Development was initially slowed by locally cooler sea surface temperatures and dry air, and the depression became Tropical Storm Patricia later that day. Once clear of the unfavorable region, Patricia traversed anomalously warm waters within an environment exceptionally conducive to rapid intensification. Dramatic strengthening began late on October 21 and continued through October 23\\\\. Patricia reached hurricane strength shortly after 00:00 UTC on October 22, featuring prominent outflow, well-defined banding features, and a developing eye. Data from Hurricane Hunters investigating the cyclone indicated Patricia to have reached Category 4 status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale by 18:00 UTC. Satellite animation of Patricia weakening considerably before making landfall on October 23 By the early hours of October 23, a clear northward turn took place followed by acceleration northeast. A solid ring of cloud tops surrounded the hurricane's wide eye and signaled its intensification into a Category 5 hurricane. In a 24-hour time span, Patricia's maximum sustained winds increased by 120 mph (195 km/h), the fastest such intensification in any hurricane observed by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The hurricane achieved its peak around 12:00 UTC on October 23, with estimated winds around 215 mph (345 km/h) and a barometric pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75 inHg); these values are based upon continued intensification after a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm six hours prior. In the NHC's report on Patricia, it is noted that the hurricane may have surpassed Typhoon Tip as the strongest tropical cyclone ever observed, but lack of direct observations at the time of its peak prevent analysis of such. Later on October 23, rapid weakening ensued as an eyewall replacement cycle took shape and wind shear increased. In the five hours up until landfall in Mexico, Patricia weakened at an unprecedented rate while still over water. However, upon moving ashore around 23:00 UTC near Cuixmala, Jalisco, it remained a strong Category 4 hurricane, with sustained winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) and an analyzed pressure of 932 mbar (hPa; 27.49 inHg). This made Patricia the most intense landfalling Pacific hurricane on record. Once onshore, the high terrain of the Sierra Madre mountains accelerated Patricia's weakening. The low- and mid-level circulations of the tropical cyclone decoupled, with the latter accelerating northeast, and Patricia dissipated on October 24 over central Mexico, less than 18 hours after moving ashore. =Records= Hurricane Patricia set multiple records for maximum strength, rate of intensification, and rate of weakening throughout its relatively short existence. With maximum sustained winds of 215 mph (345 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 872 mbar (hPa; 25.75 inHg), Patricia is the most intense tropical cyclone ever observed in the Western Hemisphere. In terms of central pressure, it is also the second-most intense tropical cyclone ever recorded worldwide, just shy of Typhoon Tip in 1979 which had a minimum pressure of 870 mbar (hPa; 25.69 inHg). Patricia's one-minute maximum sustained winds ranked as the highest ever reliably observed or estimated in a tropical cyclone, surpassing Typhoon Haiyan of 2013. The magnitude of Patricia's rapid intensification is among the fastest ever observed. In a 24-hour period, 06:00‚Äì06:00 UTC October 22‚Äì23, its maximum sustained winds increased from 85 mph (140 km/h) to 205 mph (335 km/h), a record increase of 120 mph (195 km/h). During the same period, Patricia's central pressure fell by 95 mbar (hPa; 2.81 inHg). Despite record over-water weakening prior to striking Mexico, Patricia became the most intense Pacific hurricane to make landfall, with a pressure of 932 mbar (hPa; 27.52 inHg). Preparations President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto meets with cabinet members to discuss Hurricane Patricia on October 23 Before Hurricane Patricia arrived, the Government of Mexico issued multiple watches and warnings for coastal communities. A hurricane watch was first raised at 09:00 UTC on October 21, encompassing areas of Michoac√°n, Colima, and Jalisco. A tropical storm watch also covered portions of Guerrero. As Patricia intensified, the government issued a hurricane warning for areas between Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco, and Punta San Telmo, Michoac√°n; a tropical storm warning supplemented this for areas farther north and east. The hurricane warning was extended northward to include areas south of San Blas, Nayarit, on October 23\\\\. Once the storm moved inland and the threat of damaging winds diminished, these warnings were gradually discontinued on October 24. Evacuation from hotel Riu Vallarta on the morning before Hurricane Patricia made landfall Following Patricia's upgrade to Category 5 status, the National Hurricane Center called the storm \\"potentially catastrophic\\", a source of criticism and praise from various media. Citing the relatively limited damage and loss of life, some outlets, including the Associated Press, claimed the agency was exaggerating the danger posed by the storm. However, most outlets praised them for effectively communicating the dire threat and potentially saving lives from an exceptionally powerful hurricane. Across Michoac√°n, Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit, 1,782 shelters were opened on October 22 with a collective capacity of 258,000 people. Officials in Manzanillo began distributing sandbags during the afternoon of October 22. Schools across Guerrero and Jalisco suspended activities for October 22 and 23, respectively. Civil protection officials planned to evacuate roughly 50,000 people from Colima, Jalisco, and Nayarit. To expedite the process, 2 aircraft and 600 buses were used to shuttle evacuees. Ultimately, 8,500 people evacuated prior to the storm's arrival, including 2,600 in Cabo Corrientes. One person died during an evacuation in Jalisco. Roughly 25,000 personnel from the Mexican Army, Navy, and Federal Police were deployed preemptively. More than 500 Red Cross volunteers were on standby. The Mexican Red Cross prepositioned food for 3,500 families. Approximately of aid was prepositioned in Colima for distribution after the hurricane's passage. The Electric Federal Commission dispatched 2,500 crewmen, 152 cranes, 15 all-terrain vehicles, 4 helicopters, and 84 generators to cope with potential power outages. Mexican authorities received praise for effectively carrying out emergency preparations. Impact from precursor disturbance The sprawling precursor to Hurricane Patricia over Central America on October 17 The precursor of Patricia was a large and sprawling system that affected much of Central America with heavy rain for several days. Rainfall was enhanced by the presence of multiple systems, including a tropical wave and a second disturbance over the Caribbean Sea. One person was killed in the Alta Verapaz Department and approximately 2,100 people required evacuation across Guatemala. A total of 442 homes and of crops were damaged while roughly 223,000 people were affected by flooding. Government officials deployed emergency teams and Q40 million (US$5.22 million) was available for relief operations. In nearby El Salvador between of rain fell, causing similar floods. Dozens of homes were affected and four people were killed. The Goascor√°n River overflowed its banks twice in two days, inundating surrounding communities. Owing to widespread flooding, authorities suspended school activities across the country on October 19. In Nicaragua, a landslide buried four miners in Bonanza; one died while the others were rescued. The Ul√∫a River in Honduras over-topped its banks for the first time in 17 years on October 18, prompting the evacuation of more than 200 people. Furthermore, flooding damaged 10 homes in Jac√≥, Costa Rica. The aforementioned rains extended into Southwestern and Northeastern Mexico, falling from October 18‚Äì20; precipitation was enhanced by another tropical disturbance over the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Portions of Quintana Roo saw their most intense rainfall event on record, with observed in Chetumal. This surpassed the previous record of during Hurricane Wilma in 2005. Flooding affected approximately 1,500 homes in the city, with 150 people seeking refuge in public shelters. Damage in Chetumal was pegged at MX$1.4 billion (US$85.3 million). Seven municipalities were declared disaster areas accordingly. In nearby Veracruz, more than of rain caused widespread flooding; at least 50 municipalities reported damage from the event as multiple rivers over-topped their banks. Flooding in Tabasco affected of crops. In Oaxaca, several roads were washed out by the accompanying floods and mudslides, particularly in the Sierra Norte region. Widespread flooding affected large areas of Chiapas and Guerrero, prompting dozens of evacuations. In Tapachula, Chiapas, of rain fell in just 90 minutes, triggering flash floods that caught residents by surprise. Hundreds of families were affected and 64 homes were damaged or destroyed. Impact as a tropical cyclone Hurricane Patricia hours before making landfall in Jalisco =Mexico= Hurricane Patricia made landfall in Jalisco as a Category 4 hurricane during the evening of October 23\\\\. The wide core of Patricia largely avoided populated centers, passing through areas with a population density less than 30 people per square mile. This, alongside effective evacuations, is credited for the relatively low death toll, despite the hurricane's intensity. Several small communities along the path sustained tremendous damage, however. Had the hurricane moved farther east or west, the densely populated areas surrounding Manzanillo or Puerto Vallarta would have suffered a direct hit. Throughout the affected region, the storm's powerful winds left 261,989 people without electricity. Twenty-one of the nation's thirty-one states, and the Federal District, were affected by the hurricane's rain. Accumulations in Jalisco peaked at on Nevado de Colima. Roughly of crops were affected across Colima, Jalisco, Michoac√°n, and Nayarit, with deemed a total loss and partially damaged. Six deaths occurred due to direct or indirect effects of the hurricane, all in Jalisco. Damage assessments indicate total losses around MX$5.4 billion (US$325 million), primarily from agriculture and infrastructure. Jalisco The bulk carrier Los Llanitos was grounded by the hurricane Striking Jalisco as a strong Category 4 hurricane, Patricia wrought tremendous damage, though the most extreme effects were relatively localized. In the small community of Emiliano Zapata, the hurricane's violent winds tore roofs off homes and business. Countless trees were defoliated, stripped of their branches, snapped, or uprooted. Hillsides along the immediate landfall area were largely stripped of vegetation. Storm chaser Josh Morgerman described the aftermath: \\"... the tropical landscape was transformed into something barren and wintry.\\" Furthermore, the winds toppled concrete power poles and crumpled transmission towers. A total of six deaths in incidents related to Patricia were reported in the state. Two of these deaths occurred when a tree toppled over in the storm's powerful winds. A woman was also hospitalized after sustaining injuries in the same incident. Another four people were killed in an automobile accident in southern Jalisco. Two of the victims died in the wreckage and the other two died after being brought to a hospital. Throughout Jalisco, approximately 9,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. The coastal hamlet of Chamela, home to 40 families, was completely flattened. More than of crops were affected across the state: sustained total losses while were partially so. Damage from agriculture amounted to roughly MX$168 million (US$10.1 million). Total damage reached to MX$1.139 billion (US$68.6 million). A cargo ship‚Äîthe bulk carrier Los Llanitos‚Äîwas shifted off-course by the hurricane and grounded near Barra de Navidad, Jalisco. Her 27 crew were unharmed but required rescue by a military helicopter. The ship was subsequently deemed a total loss and crews began scrapping the vessel on-site in February 2016. Colima and Michoac√°n Coastal damage from Patricia in Colima In nearby Colima, preliminary surveys indicated localized but severe damage. A total of 200 schools, 107 health facilities, 34 sport facilities, and of agriculture was affected by the storm. Severe damage was incurred by the banana crops, with losses from the fruit alone estimated at MX$500 million (US$30.1 million). Total damage in the state reached MX$1.7 billion (US$102.5 million). Although Patricia made landfall farther west, damage across Michoac√°n was severe. Numerous communities were temporarily isolated as roads were either rendered impassible or washed away altogether by floods. A total of 1,512 homes were damaged and another 127 were destroyed across the state, including 600 in Coahuayana. The storm severely damaged 150 homes in the Arteaga Municipality. A portion of Highway 200 was shut down in Aquila. Agriculture sustained extensive damage with of crops destroyed; losses in the sector amounted to MX$2.5 billion (US$150.7 million). In Coahuayana alone, of bananas were ruined, the greatest loss of crops in the municipality's history; thousands of residents lost their jobs as a result of the damage. Losses to health facilities in the state reached MX$13.5 million (US$814,000). Other states The hurricane produced large swells along the shores of Guerrero on October 22, causing damage to coastal structures. The remnants of Patricia brought heavy rain to much of northern Mexico on October 24\\\\. Up to of rain was observed in Tamaulipas, resulting in flooding. Dozens of structures sustained damage and hundreds were left without power, with areas in Reynosa and R√≠o Bravo particularly affected. = United States = Patricia's direct effects in Texas were limited to southern areas of the state. Moisture associated with the hurricane streamed ahead of its circulation and interacted with a frontal boundary over the region. Antecedent rains saturated the region and produced severe flooding, with cars flooded and a train derailed. Fears arose that the collective effects of these storms would produce deadly floods, similar to those in May earlier in the year; however, no deaths resulted. Houston received of rain during a 24-hour span from October 24‚Äì25, and a brief tornado caused minor damage near the city. Rain fell at rates of per hour in southern Hidalgo County, leading to damaging flash floods. An estimated , or more, accumulated across the Progreso‚ÄìWeslaco area. Several feet of water rendered roads impassible, stranded cars, and affected more than 500 homes. Twenty-six water rescues were conducted in the area. Damage was estimated at $50 million. Several roads in and around Corpus Christi were inundated, including part of Interstate 37. Two hours of \\"blinding rains\\" flooded the majority of eastern Willacy County, prompting multiple water rescues, and leaving $2.5 million in damage. Remnant moisture then moved north and northwest through the Great Lakes, Appalachia and Mid-Atlantic states, and Florida Panhandle before exiting the nation. Aftermath In the aftermath of the hurricane, 5,791 Marines from Mexico's Naval Infantry Force were deployed to assist with recovery and rescue efforts. Rescuers reached some of the hardest-hit areas within a day of Patricia's landfall. Red Cross volunteers began needs assessments on October 24 and distribution of humanitarian aid started the following day. Power was restored to 88 percent of those affected within two days of the storm. Through the nation's livestock catastrophe fund, MX$150 million (US$9.04 million) were allocated for agricultural areas affected by the storm on October 29\\\\. Of this total, MX$76 million (US$4.58 million) were delegated to Jalisco. The Secretariat of Social Development's budget allowed for MX$250 million (US$15.1 million) in relief funds for Jalisco. Of this, MX$34 million (US$2.05 million) were allocated for affected persons. On October 27, Rafael Pacchiano Alam√°n announced an initial fund of MX$5.3 million (US$319,000) through the Temporary Employment Program (Programa de Empleo Temporal) to help spur economic recovery in Colima. On October 28, 15 of Jalisco's 125 municipalities were declared disaster areas. Of the more than of crops affected by Patricia in Jalisco, only were covered by insurance. Through late January 2016, Instituto Nacional del Emprendedor provided entrepreneurs with MX$3.577 million (US$216,000) in funds. In January 2016, the Michoac√°n Ministry of Social Development enacted a MX$10 million (US$603,000) rehabilitation program to build 605 homes in affected communities. =Retirement= Due to the hurricane's extreme intensity, the name Patricia was retired by the World Meteorological Organization on April 25, 2016. It will be replaced with Pamela for the 2021 Pacific hurricane season.

The channel airs programs about food and cooking, from cultures around the world. History SBS first revealed it would launch a channel dedicated to food on 30 September 2015, following the Australian Government's decision to not permit the public broadcaster to increase the amount of primetime advertising it is allowed to broadcast. It was Australia's first and at the time only free-to-air channel to be dedicated exclusively to food-related programming. It is broadcast 24 hours a day on channel 33, and all programs aired on the channel are also available to stream on SBS on Demand. The channel began broadcasting as Food Network on 17 November 2015 at 1 pm AEDST, replacing a simulcast of SBS. The channel initially operated under a license from Discovery Inc., the operator of the American channel of the same name. The relationship included a three year programming deal with Discovery which saw numerous American Food Network programs on the channel. The first programme shown on the channel was 30 Minute Meals. The channel was first included in the official OzTAM ratings on 1 December 2015, where it recorded a 1.3% primetime share. On 17 November 2018, the channel was rebranded to SBS Food following the ending of the Discovery Inc. deal, which saw Discovery's American shows pulled from the channel and replaced with more premium titles and less reality programming, including increased Australian content. Discovery's food shows later shifted to a new free-to-air channel, 7food network, which began broadcasting on 1 December 2018. The move proved disastrous to Seven and Discovery, and after disappointing ratings, 7food network was shut down on 28 December 2019 and its programming dispersed among Seven's networks, making SBS Food once again the only Australian free-to-air channel dedicated exclusively to food.

This approach can be seen in several ways. Teacher candidates who are learning to become teachers are asked to co-teach with experienced associate teachers, whereby the classroom responsibilities are shared, and the teacher candidate can learn from the associate teacher. Regular classroom teachers and special education teachers can be paired in co-teaching relationships to benefit inclusion of students with special needs. Recently, in Ontario the Full-Day Early Learning Kindergarten Program has been implemented where an Ontario Certified Teacher and a Registered Early Childhood Educator co-teach in a kindergarten classroom. To evaluate the effectiveness of co-teaching, partnerships can use the Magiera-Simmons Quality Indicator Model of Co- Teaching, which gives standard definitions for co-teaching skills through 25 quality indicators and a rating scale. Co-teaching is often evaluated on the amount of shared leadership is present, the amount of co-planning time, honest communication between the two educators, and how much respect and trust is present in the relationship. Models There are several models of co- teaching, identified by Friend and Cook (1996), including: * One Teach, One Support: One teacher leads instruction, while the other provides support to students who need additional help or enrichment, gathers observation data, or provides classroom management. * Parallel Teaching: Each teacher, or teacher and student teacher, plan jointly but each teaches the same information to different halves of the classroom at the same time. * Alternative Teaching: One teacher manages most of the class while the other teacher works with a small group inside or outside of the classroom. The small group does not have to integrate with the current lesson. * Station Teaching: Both teachers divide the instructional content, and each takes responsibility for planning and teaching part of it. In station teaching, the classroom is divided into various teaching centers. The teacher and student teacher are at particular stations; the other stations are run independently by the students or by a teacher‚Äôs aide. * Team Teaching: Both teachers are responsible for planning and share the instruction of all students. The lessons are taught by both teachers who actively engage in conversation, not lecture, to encourage discussion by students. Both teachers are actively involved in the management of the lesson and discipline. Research Research on the effectiveness of co-teaching has yielded mixed results. As a delivery model for special education services, one study found important strategies were infrequently observed in this model, and the special education teacher played a subordinate role. Another study reviewed student outcomes via a resource room model and co-teaching. It found resource room delivery superior in terms of academic progress. Other research has shown that the results of co-teaching benefit both the educators and the students. but the study lacked long-term data. One author reviewed eight studies of students impressions of co-teaching, and found the majority preferred receiving services outside of the classroom for part of the day, noting they formed a better relationship with their special education teacher and understood content better in specialized instruction within a resource room.

In the year 960, by the Islamic calendar, he went to Constantinople. There he learned the Ottoman Turkish language and made contact with many distinguished poets of the time. After residing in the capital for 11 years, he returned to Baghdad (971 IC). There he continued being part of the poetic circles. The Ottoman historian and traveler Mustafa √Çl√Æ mentions Ahdi as one of the best known poets in Baghdad during 1585-1586, out of 30 in total. Ahdi's main work is the tezkire named G√ºl≈üen-i ≈ûuara (Rosebed of Poets), which he wrote the same year on his return home.

It was built in 1940s. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008.  History  The Kin Kin Sawmill, established in 1948 by Arthur Hempsall and his son Lionel, is located midway between Gympie and Noosa in the Sunshine Coast township of the same name. The Hempsall family owned the mill until 1991 when it was sold to Geoff Ellis. It continues to operate as a small mill with much of its original machinery and layout still intact. South Queensland produced the largest amount of timber in the Queensland by the middle of the 20th century: in the North Coast region (now known as the Sunshine Coast), there were some 122 sawmills in 1949, the largest number in the Queensland. The quantity of logs cut on the North Coast in 1947-48 was over 40000, the third largest in Queensland behind Brisbane and Atherton. The Kin Kin sawmill was originally established to produce wooden packing cases for the local fruit growing industry. The North Coast was an important fruit growing region and during the first half of the 20th century, Kin Kin was one of Queensland most productive banana-growing areas. The sawmill produced cases for bananas, pineapples, beans, apples and plums. Cases were railed from Pomona railway station to destinations as far afield as Brisbane and the fruit growing areas near Stanthorpe. Case milling was an important industry associated with fruit growing. It was valued because it provided a useful outlet for timber which would otherwise have no economic value. There was a high demand for fruit and vegetable cases in the immediate post-War period with case milling peaking in 1949. 45% of cases were manufactured for packaging fresh fruit but they were also used for a range of other foodstuffs and manufactured goods. By the early 1950s, corrugated fibre board containers, developed during World War II, began to compete with the traditional wooden cases and the latter experienced a steady decline in use. By 1955 - 56 there were still some 58 wooden case manufacturers in Queensland comprising mostly small firms. Some 40% of the case millers in Queensland also milled timber for other uses. Although not dissimilar in layout to other types of sawmills, case mills were typically smaller in scale owing to the smaller size of the logs that were milled and the smaller size of the end product. A three-person mill, comprising a single circular saw bench (number one bench) and a docking saw, could produce up to 500 cases per day. Logs were broken down at the number one bench into longitudinal lengths of timber (flitches). The flitches were cut to required length at the docking saw. Waste material from the initial breaking down process (including edging) was cut down for firewood at the docking saw or disposed of. The lengths of timber ready for assembly as cases were known as \\"shooks\\". Larger, general purpose mills typically comprised three circular saws and a docker. The initial break-down of the log was usually carried out at the Canadian bench (the largest circular saw). Further sizing was carried out at number one and two benches and the planks were cut to length at the docker. When initially erected, the Kin Kin mill comprised only the number one saw bench and a docking saw. Both of these saws are still extant, but the docking saw has been relocated within the shed. The saws were powered by a tractor. Probably from the early 1950s after the mill was connected to electricity, a Canadian Saw, and number two bench were added and the docking saw was moved. The mill layout has remained largely unchanged since then. In its present form it resembles a typical sawmill layout of the 1950s. The original hand-operated winch for moving logs through the breakdown saw remains extant and also the early electrical insulators tracing the original path of the cabling along the underside of the roof. The mill originally cut soft wood timber for cases. This was cut to the required lengths and then packaged for delivery to the farmers who assembled the cases. The mill subsequently moved into cutting timber for pallets, and hardwood milling for electricity pole cross-arms and railway sleepers. In 2007, the mill was cutting softwood for assembly into packing cases for glass. It is one of the few sawmills of its era that is still operating on the North Coast.  Description  Sawmill interior, 2009 Standing against the backdrop of the surrounding hills on Sister Tree Creek Road west of the town of Kin Kin, the Kin Kin Sawmill occupies a flat open area to the east of Kin Kin Creek. The structures associated with the sawmill operations comprise the large open mill shed, a small timber office building, a number of timber and corrugated iron sheds and the sawdust/waste area. The site also accommodates timber storage areas and forklift and other vehicle parking. Sawmill shed Standing close to the road at the southeast corner of the site, the heart of the mill operations is an open timber framed shed with corrugated iron clad roofs. The main part is sheltered by a gable roof the north side of which extends west over the docker area and northeast with a small skillion roof over the number two bench. The shed is framed with sawn and unsawn timber, the roof supported by round posts. The compact milling operation is organised around the sequence of saws and the accompanying benches, motors, trolleys and rails accommodated within the shed. The saws stand in a line from the breakdown saw (Canadian saw) to the south to the number two bench saw to the north. Timber logs are stacked by forklift at the southwest, rolled onto a trolley where they are secured with a dog and run through the breakdown saw for the half cut. The cut logs then roll across to the number one bench saw where the bark is stripped and the half logs are cut into width planks. The cut planks are stacked north of the number one bench and taken across to the number two bench saw where they are cut into thinner boards which are stacked to the west and taken across to the docker where they are cut into shorter lengths (mostly ). From here the boards pass to the groover where the sides are grooved before being placed in the pallet stack west of the log stack. A number of trolleys on rails take the offcuts and waste from the various bench areas out to the west side of the shed. The original hand-operated winch for moving logs through the breakdown saw stands to the east of the trolley rails for the breakdown saw and the early electrical insulators trace the original path of the cabling along the underside of the roof.  Heritage listing  Kin Kin Sawmill was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 November 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Kin Kin Sawmill (1948) is important in demonstrating the development of Queensland's timber industry insofar as it was established when the North Coast (now the Sunshine Coast) was one of the most important timber producing regions in the state. During the period that the mill was established, the North Coast contained more sawmills than anywhere else in Queensland. As a sawmill originally established to produce timber for fruit packing cases, it is also important in demonstrating the evolution of the State's fruit growing industry. At the time, the North Coast was among the most productive fruit growing regions in the State. It is also indicative of the former use of timber as a material for packing cases. By the 1950s, timber was being superseded by corrugated fibre board as the preferred material for packaging. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The sawmill is uncommon in the region as an intact example of a small saw mill originally established to produce timber for fruit packing cases. Mills of this type were common in the fruit growing areas of the State until the late 1950s when the use of wooden packing cases declined. The mill is also uncommon in the region for its continuity of operation since the 1940s. The basic layout of the shed remains largely unchanged since the 1950s and original items of machinery continue to form key components of the operation. Economic and environmental factors have meant that sawmills of this era have become increasingly rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The sawmill is a highly intact example of a small sawmill originally established to produce timber for packaging cases. The layout and all of the components typically found in a small mill of the 1950s remain including: the characteristic open-sided shed, early electrical insulators tracing the route of the original cabling, breakdown (Canadian) saw, number one and two saw benches, docking saw, original hand-operated winch, rails and trolleys. The milling operation continues to follow the traditional packing case sequence of initial cut at the breakdown (Canadian) saw, sizing at the number one and two benches and cut to lengths at the docker.

The book, which was Lindsay's first-published work, was based on her time spent traveling in Europe, and functions as a parody of English tourists abroad. It is structured in the format of a travel book through a series of first-person letters edited together to form a metafictional narrative. The narrative is accompanied by photographs of the adventures, which were shot by Lindsay with her friends in a backyard in East Melbourne. Plot The narrative is presented as a series of letters edited by one Rev. Barnaby Whitecorn D.D., who is purported to be the author‚Äôs \\"next door neighbour,\\" and is also illustrated with plated photographs of the adventures. The author, the English Serena Livingston- Stanley, her friend, Francis, and maidservant Placket, sail from Harwich on ‚ÄòMay 14th‚Äô in an unspecified year into the Mediterranean and via the Suez Canal reach Ceylon on 12 June. Ten days later they sight the island of Pondelayo, an island inhabited by cannibals, and anchor off Bogtuk. The women lodge at the Mission House, and are entertained by Judge Wiggins and his topless black female ‚Äòservant‚Äô Rosie, and in mid-July set out to explore the remote interior of the island accompanied by a wide array of characters, including Wiggins, Rosie, the Hon. Mrs. Pringle, Mrs. Garble and Captain Fitzkhaki-Campbell. In Dead Mother-in-Laws Cove, the adventure party faces a crocodile-infested swamp, and on 27 July arrives at Tikki Bahaar, the first native village they encounter. They investigate the Lake of a Million Fishes, where Francis gets lost in the jungle and Placket gives a month‚Äôs notice. Later, in August, they cross the notorious Bobo River, cross the Parrot Gully, and climb Mount Blim Blam, a volcano in active eruption. From the Great Cataract they beat their way through the dense jungles of Upper Timwiffi and arrive back at Dead Mother-in-Laws Cove on 18 September. The narrative ends at the Mission House on 1 October with the author telegraphing the Reverend Whitecorn for the loan of five pounds to cover the cost of her return passage. She arrives safely back in the English Channel on 7 November. Narrative style The book is presented as an autobiographical travel narrative. Lindsay wrote the novel as a satire on English tourists abroad after having spent significant time in Europe with husband Daryl Lindsay. Included in the book are multiple photos, presented as lithographs, featuring Lindsay and friends posed in various simulations as the characters enacting events depicted within the narrative. The narrative is also littered with intentional grammatical errors.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2009.  History  The Majestic Theatre at 3 Factory Street Pomona, which was originally built as a social hall with attached shops in 1921, has been promoted as the oldest authentic silent movie theatre in the world, and the longest continuously operating movie theatre in Australia. Although the building's fabric was extensively refurbished recently, the timber and fibrous cement sheeted building is still a rare, and functional, example of a pre-World War II country hall that was converted into a picture theatre. By the 1860s timber getting was the main local industry in the Pomona area. The Co-Operative Communities Land Settlement Act 1893 led to two experimental farming communes being established in the Noosa Shire, and although the Protestant Unity Group near Pomona only lasted from 1894 to 1896, some of the group's settlers stayed on the land as individual selectors. The North Coast railway line from Brisbane to Gympie was completed in 1891, and the bend where local settlers hailed the train to send their goods to market was called the Cooroora railway siding, after the nearby mountain. The name was later changed to the Pinbarren siding, but when a town was surveyed in 1900, the name of Pomona, the Roman Goddess of fruit, was chosen. The Pomona Hotel was licensed in 1906, west of the railway line, and this was followed by the Railway Hotel in 1911, east of the railway line on today's Factory Street. Noosa Shire was created in 1910, and the Shire Council office was based in Pomona until 1980. In the first decade of the 20th century, industry in the area shifted from timber to dairying and horticulture as land was cleared. Until the establishment of a butter factory at Kin Kin in 1914, cream was sent by road to Cooran, and then by rail to Gympie's butter factory, established in 1898. Butter factories were also opened at Cooroy in 1915 and at Pomona in 1919. Bananas were also an important industry in the Shire after 1908, booming in the 1920s before declining in the early 1930s. Dairying remained as the main industry in the Noosa Shire from the 1930s until its decline in the 1960s. By the 1990s, Pomona was relying on fruit, and furniture manufacture for its livelihood. Errol and Myra Osborne became licensees of the Railway Hotel in 1921, and that year they decided to build a hall to the south of the hotel to augment their facilities, and to attract commercial travellers, who needed space to display their wares. The land on which the Majestic Theatre stands was purchased in January 1921 by Myra Osborne's mother, Clara McDonald, who also financed the building of the hall. In August 1921 Errol Osborne supplied plans for the hall to the Noosa Shire Council, and in October 1921 R. McTackett requested permission to erect an awning in front of the hall he was erecting. In December 1921 Mrs McDonald requested that the Council make up a footpath in front of the newly erected Majestic Hall, offering to pay half of the cost. The Council agreed, so long as the job did not exceed . The hall was designed to serve several functions: to show silent movies, for vaudeville productions, and to act as a social centre for the town. Over time it served as a venue for dances, balls, concerts, and wedding functions, roller skating, boxing, and church services. Constructed of unseasoned milled hardwood, the hall was about wide by long, with seating for 198 people. It included a sprung dance floor of crow's ash timber, still extant today, and was raised on stumps to avoid flooding. The roof sagged inwards within several years of construction, and this profile remained until renovations during 2006 and 2007. On either side of the entrance to the hall were small shops. On the left hand side was the Majestic Cafe, which also served as general store before being used for storage from the 1930s, and the right hand side's shop accommodated at various times a dentist, radio shop, and a mechanic. In the mid 1920s a supper room was added to the long southeast elevation of the hall, and this section was later extended to the northeast. Travelling Picture Show Men initially called at the Majestic Hall to show silent movies, but in 1923 the hall was leased by Mrs Osborne to Harold \\"Picture\\" Page, who obtained a theatre license that year. Herbert Page (unrelated), of Page Furnishers, was called \\"Blue Shirt\\" Page, to distinguish him from Picture Page. Reportedly, the early silent films in Pomona were accompanied by a schoolgirl playing random music on a pianola. On 28 April 1931 the first talkie, or movie recorded with its own soundtrack, was shown at the hall, and around 1933 the hall's lease was transferred to Ernie Bazzo, who upgraded the hall to a theatre by adding a small gallery and a bio box. A number of local social functions were shifted to the new Pomona Memorial Hall during this decade. In the late 1930s Bazzo used seating from the Princess Theatre in South Brisbane to replace the existing canvas sling seating. The Pomona Talkie Company was registered on 1 October 1935, and involved Errol Osborne, Ernest Bazzo, and Charles S. Thomson. Bazzo also owned the nearby Central Garage, and worked as a mechanic during the day, operating the theatre at night. The Majestic Theatre, Pomona is first listed under Theatres and Picture Shows in the Queensland Post Office Directory (Trades) in 1940, and the land on which the theatre stands was transferred to Bazzo in October 1948. The development of the Majestic Theatre in Pomona reflected wider trends in Queensland's society. Moving pictures became a popular form of entertainment in Queensland soon after the first films were exhibited in Brisbane in the late 1890s. Hotels were often associated with early picture shows, especially in rural areas, where films might be shown in an adjacent hall or garden. Initially, travelling picture shows in rural areas were screened in halls, with the Picture Show Men travelling regular circuits, but later dedicated theatres were built in small towns, with a local resident ‚Äì sometimes the local motor garage proprietor ‚Äì working the projector. Many theatres were built with attached retail spaces, including a cafe or milk bar for patrons, and a cantilevered street awning. As an alternative to purpose-built theatres, halls were regularly converted into picture theatres by erecting bio-boxes, installing a gallery, or adding new seating and sound equipment. Halls usually contained a supper room along the length of one side, for light meals during balls and other social functions. From the 1910s until the advent of television, rural theatres provided an important social service to people in the surrounding area, including stimulus for the imagination, relief from isolation, and a link with the wider community in Australia and with United States' popular culture. Local picture theatres were also used as social venues for school concerts and dances, and many had level, sprung dance floors. Most small theatres were independently owned, with Queensland having more independent theatres than any other state in Australia. In the 1930s there were about 200 theatres in Queensland, and 75% of these were located outside Brisbane. However, post-war social, economic and technological trends would eventually spell the end for most small rural picture theatres. Almost half of the theatres exhibiting in 1960 and 1961 (388 in Queensland) had closed by 1971. The Majestic Theatre was operated by Ernie Bazzo until he suffered a stroke in 1973. Its busiest period was during World War II, when a Tank Attack (anti-tank gun) Regiment was stationed near Pomona. The troops had priority for seats, and local civilians were irate when they could not get in. Often, people would watch from outside, standing in the middle of the road, which was then the original Bruce Highway. The theatre remained popular after the war, and throughout the 1940s to the 1960s films were shown on Wednesday and Friday evenings and Saturday afternoon, with a cartoon and two movies for four shillings and sixpence. In 1956 the original projector equipment was replaced with equipment from the Tivoli Theatre in Brisbane. At the interval between movies, patrons adjourned to the Kia Ora Cafe next door for pies. This building, later known as the Majestic Cafe, was located north of the theatre, and burnt down c.2002. In 1973 Ron and Mandy West introduced the Travelling Film Festival, which featured first-release and avant garde films, to the Majestic Theatre, and the festival screened at Pomona until 1994. The Wests purchased the theatre in 1974, although title to the land on which it stands was not transferred until January 1979. The Majestic remained the Noosa Shire's only picture theatre until 1984. The film projection equipment was replaced in 1980, and a DVD system was installed in 2003. Ron West was raised in New Zealand, where he worked in picture theatres as an ice cream boy and a projectionist, and he also worked in theatre stage management, and as a musician or conductor in orchestra music pits. During 13 years as a sound engineer for the Commonwealth Film Unit in Sydney, he ventured into film production and photography. Ron's late wife Mandy shared his interest in the theatre, and during the 1980s she directed an amateur theatrical group, The Majestic Players, in pantomimes and plays on stage at the Majestic, the stage having been enlarged in 1979. Classical concerts were also held on Sunday afternoons by visiting musicians. Around April 1985 Judith Durham (of The Seekers) and her husband Ronald Edgeworth gave concerts on Friday, Saturday and Sunday for five weekends. In the early 1990s school plays were performed at the Majestic. During the 1980s the theatre also operated as a video hire outlet to help keep it viable. In 1987 West was asked to show a silent movie to a group of travel agents, and since he possessed a print of the 1926 film The Son of the Sheik, starring Rudolf Valentino, he ran the film and accompanied it with his restored Wurlitzer pipe organ, making up the music as he went along. Word got around, and after several months the Wests decided to only show silent movies at the Majestic, which gained worldwide recognition as a silent movie house. Six days a week, the Majestic was open to school visits and coach loads of Australian and international tourists. The most popular silent films shown since 1987 include The Son of the Sheik, the original Raymond Longford production of Dad and Dave in On our Selection, and Charlie Chaplin and Jackie Cooper in The Kid. In 2004 West received the premier Noosa Shire Australia Day Award for his services to culture and the community. 1936 Organ from the Regal Cinema, South Shields, England West has an interest in pipe organs, and he has used them to accompany the silent films at the Majestic. The current organ console, the only one in a Queensland theatre, is located to the left of the stage and is an electrical 1936 Compton from the Regal Cinema in South Shields, England. It was rebuilt during 2006 and 2007 by West and John Brooks. The pipe chamber, which also contains a bank of 1930s electrical organ switches from the Theatre Royal in Halifax, is located within the former supper room extension on the south east side of the theatre. Three ranks of Christie pipes in the chamber were originally from a theatre in Dunedin, New Zealand, and were owned by a church in Sydney before they were acquired by West in 1985. Other ranks of pipes have been obtained, with the hope of eventually having 12 ranks. West did not just collect pipe organ parts ‚Äì the timber organ grill that separates the organ room from the auditorium is made of Oregon pine, and comes from the Roxy Theatre in Parramatta. In the past West has also salvaged stage drapes, furnishings and equipment from the Regent, Wintergarden, Her Majesty's theatres in Brisbane, and the Wintergarden in Ipswich. The former office of the Pomona Butter Factory (since incorporated into the Page Furnishers' factory complex) was given to the Wests and now stands behind the theatre. In late 2006 the land on which the theatre stands was transferred to Pomona Progress Art Tourism Inc, a community group which intends to run the Majestic Theatre as an all-purpose entertainment venue. Ron West stayed on to manage the theatre and to play the organ during silent movies. In September 2006 the first team of SkillCentred Community Jobs Project workers (whose wages were paid by the Queensland Government), began an upgrade of the theatre, which reopened in mid 2007. Grants were also provided by the Noosa Shire Council and the Australian Government. Upgrades included restumping the building with steel, replacing the roofing iron and correcting the roof's sag with steel reinforcement, bracing walls, refixing much of the exterior cladding, and replacing interior linings and the ceiling. Asbestos boards used in the building were replaced with modern materials. The fixed seating was removed and was replaced with moveable seating built by Page Furnishers, and the organ chamber was rebuilt and extended. The roof of the stage was raised to match the roof of the auditorium, the floor of the dressing room was raised to stage level, and new sliding doors were installed at the rear of the building. The former Majestic Cafe was refurbished for use as Valentino's Restaurant, while the former shop space to the right of the main entrance was refurbished as a modern kitchen. The sprung dance floor was sanded back and oiled, the toilet area was modernised, and a snack and beverages bar was installed in the foyer. New paths and ramps have been added around the building's exterior.  Description  Interior, Majestic Theatre, 2009 At the south end of Factory Street on the east side of the railway line, the Majestic Theatre stands prominently in the streetscape of the Pomona. A long rectangular cream-painted building, with a striking red trim picking out a number of element (posts, window sills, fascias and cover strips), the theatre is sheltered by a gable roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting crowned with a barrel-roofed ventilation ridge. The roof is concealed from the street by a three-part timber framed parapet with curved fibreboard panels. A bull nosed awning supported by bevelled timber posts with decorative Y-shaped brackets projects out from the building sheltering the footpath. The building is clad with chamferboards and stands on low concrete stumps. Metal screens run on rails along the north side of the building shading the large web lattice screen to the restaurant. A gable roofed bio-box projects from the building over the central entrance, within the awning. Clad with fibreboard fixed with batten cover strips, the bio-box has two pairs of casement windows overlooking the street. The underside of the bio-box forms a ceiling to the entrance and is lined with fibreboard with cover strips formed into decorative diamond patterns. Timber steps rise from the footpath to the timber floored entrance porch, the sides of which funnel in towards the pair of large timber entrance doors. The walls to the porch are clad with vertical timber boards. The early ticket booth window, now boarded up, is to the right hand side of the entrance porch. The theatre is organised around the central auditorium, with flanking sides accommodating a restaurant and toilets to the north; and a cafe, commercial kitchen, organ room and storage to the south. The small foyer has a plain battened fibreboard ceiling sloping towards the auditorium and accommodates a recently fitted bar and ticket booth. It opens to the sides to the restaurant and cafe. A timber framed partition lined with fibreboard separates the foyer and auditorium. A dress circle sits above the foyer and is reached by a set of timber stairs to the left of the doorway from the foyer into the auditorium. The dress circle has a sloping timber floor and accommodates several rows of moveable seats. The bio-box standing to the rear of the dress circle is newly lined with plasterboard and accommodates the electronic console controlling the film projection. The auditorium has a flat (not raked, as often found in theatres) floor of fine crow's ash boards and a coved ceiling newly lined with plasterboard with plain batten cover strips. Timber vents run around the perimeter at skirting level. A raised, timber- floored stage with a decorated proscenium arch stands at the east end of the auditorium. The proscenium arch has decorative scrolls to the overhead centre panel and painted landscape scenes to the horizontal side panels. A round framed landscape painting sits to the centre of decorative scrollwork. A white painted Compton organ console stands in the auditorium to the left of the stage. A timber fretted screen to the right side wall allows the projection of sound from the plant room of the organ housed in the room adjacent. The plant for the organ includes pipes, various sound effects mechanisms, wiring and other apparatus. Remnants of an earlier decorative paint scheme remain to the side walls of auditorium presently covered by long red serge curtains. The scheme is notable for a decorative wallpaper dado frieze. Recent moveable metal framed and fabric upholstered chairs made by Page Furnishers of Pomona can be arranged in rows within the auditorium or stacked when not in use. The stage opens externally to the rear by sliding doors onto a narrow timber floored dock running across the exterior the building. The two flanking shopfronts each have large two-light clear glass windows with six small patterned lights above and a narrow timber entrance door. Valentino's Restaurant is accommodated within the north side shop space. The interior decorative scheme includes a copy of the early decorative dado motif and paint scheme found in theatre auditorium. The roof framing is strengthened with steel sleeves to the timber trusses. A plaque indicating the theatre is part of the Pomona heritage walk is fixed to the front of the building. A newly concreted footpath has metal stars set within it recognising those who have contributed to the ongoing success of the theatre, including Ron and Mandy West.  Heritage listing  The Majestic Theatre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Majestic Theatre in Pomona, a venue that has shown films continuously since 1921, is important in demonstrating the development of picture theatres in Queensland and the part that picture-going played in the life of rural Queenslanders from the 1920s to the 1950s. The Majestic Theatre, constructed as the Majestic Hall and modified in the 1930s to show \\"talkies\\", also demonstrates the evolution of film exhibition venues in Queensland, whereby community halls were often used to show pictures, prior to converting the hall into a picture theatre, or constructing a purpose-built cinema. In addition, it demonstrates the practice of independent film exhibition by owner-operators in rural Queensland towns. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The Majestic theatre is rare as one of the few pre-World War II picture theatres remaining in Queensland that have not been demolished or adapted to other uses. It is also Queensland's longest continuously operating picture theatre. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Although the Majestic Theatre was recently refurbished, its floor plan and design still illustrates the characteristics of a small rural picture theatre that has been adapted from a local hall. These characteristics include the hall's original retail spaces and the supper room section on the southeast elevation. The installation of a bio-box and gallery was also a typical means of converting a hall into a picture theatre. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Over the last 20 years the Majestic Theatre has developed a following of silent film enthusiasts, and its popularity ensured that the theatre's refurbishment during 2006‚Äì2007 received financial support from private individuals and businesses as well as from the Local, State, and Federal governments.

The Irish diaspora in the nineteenth century reached New Zealand, with many Irish people immigrating to the country, predominantly to Auckland, Canterbury and the West Coast. With Irish immigration to New Zealand, the Irish people established Catholic churches and schools especially in Auckland. Currently, there are roughly 600,000 New Zealanders today of Irish ancestry, with Irish culture influencing the culture of New Zealand. The descendants of the Irish people and their culture have mixed with other New Zealand European cultures to form modern-day New Zealand culture. However, unlike many Scottish settlers in Otago and Southland Irish settlers were more spread out across the country, resulting in visible Irish communities throughout New Zealand that began to mix with other communities. Job opportunities for Irish-born New Zealanders were limited as a result of anti-Irish bias. However, this did not stop many joining the New Zealand Police Force with 40% being of Irish ancestry into the 1930s. During this period of Irish immigration, especially in the nineteenth century, many Irish- born immigrants would have called themselves British instead of Irish, probably because loyalty towards the British Empire increased as with many other European settlers in New Zealand. One of the main reasons the Irish immigrated to New Zealand was because of the Great Famine.  Irish culture in New Zealand  The Irish national public holiday, St. Patrick's Day is widely celebrated in New Zealand with over 65 pubs around the country taking part. Nevertheless, Irish influence in New Zealand culture is not as influential as the Scottish and English cultures brought to New Zealand. Irish immigration to New Zealand; 1840‚Äì1915 Irish immigration to New Zealand during the Irish diaspora in the nineteenth and early twentieth was predominantly from the region of Ulster. Immigration from the region of Leinster however, was quite common to New Zealand from 1840 towards 1852. However, immigration during the Irish diaspora from Connaught was uncommon, making up a small percentage of Irish immigration in New Zealand. Politics More significant expressions of Irish culture came in politics. The long struggles in Ireland for land reform, home rule rather than English rule, and eventually independence were a major concern of British politics throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. Many in New Zealand followed these debates and crises, and expressed their sympathies in a number of ways. Occasionally it came in the form of civil disorder. There were 'shindies' between Irish Catholics and Irish Protestant Orangemen (a Protestant group) at ≈åkƒÅrito in 1865. In Christchurch on Boxing Day 1879, 30 Irishmen attacked an Orange procession with pick-handles, and in Timaru 150 men from Thomas O‚ÄôDriscoll's Hibernian Hotel surrounded Irish Orangemen and prevented their procession.

It was built in 1934. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 May 2005.  History  The Police and court house precinct at Pomona is bounded by Red Street and Rectory Street, and contains three significant 1930s government buildings, all of which are still in use in some form. The close spatial relationship of the wooden police residence (& former station), court house, and lock-up is typical of pre-World War II Queensland police precincts, and the history of the site reflects the history of the Pomona district. In the 1850s the area was used for cattle runs, but by the 1860s timber getting was a local industry. The Unoccupied Crown Lands Act 1860, and the Crown Land Alienation Acts 1868 aided this process. Access to cheap land assisted the harvesting of kauri, cedar, hoop pine and beech, and hastened closer settlement. The discovery of gold at Gympie by James Nash in 1867 also stimulated development in the district. In 1868, the main road to Gympie ran a couple of miles west of the current Shire, but an alternative route ran through Tewantin, which was surveyed in 1871. The Gympie-Cooran rail link established in 1889 was used to transport timber from the Kin Kin and Pinbarren Scrub areas, and the Eumundi to Cooroy line was built in 1891. The Co-Operative Communities Land Settlement Act 1893 also led to two experimental communities being established in the shire. Pomona was established to give settlers in the scrublands better access to the 1891 North Coast railway line. Before Pomona was surveyed in 1900, the bend where settlers hailed the train to send their goods to market was called the \\"Pinbarren siding\\". As the name Pinbarren was already taken by another settlement, Pomona, the name of the Roman Goddess of fruit, was chosen for the new town. The Pinbarren Provisional School (1897) became the Pomona State School in 1908. The current Noosa Shire was created in 1909, and covers the towns of Cooran, Pomona, Cooroy, Tewantin and Noosa, and the Shire Council office was based in Pomona until 1980. In the first decade of the 20th century, industry in the area shifted from timber to dairying. In 1907 the Cooroy estate was resumed from a sawmiller, enabling close settlement by New South Wales dairy farmers, and fruit, sugar cane, and maize was also grown. Kin Kin was opened up for dairying after 1904, and trees were cleared for pasture. Until the establishment of a butter factory at Kin Kin (1912-1937), cream was sent by road to Cooran, and then by rail to Gympie's butter factory, established in 1898. Butter factories were also opened at Cooroy in 1915 (closed 1976), and at Pomona in 1919 (closed 1970). However, bananas were also an important crop in the Shire after 1908, peaking in the 1920s before being decimated by \\"Bunchy Top\\" disease in the 1930s. With the decline of banana growing, dairying was the main industry in the Noosa Shire from the 1930s to the 1960s, when competition from margarine, the loss of butter markets, and pasture decline saw dairying replaced by beef cattle. By the 1990s, Pomona was relying on fruit and furniture manufacture for its livelihood. As the district developed and evolved, so too did the system of policing in Queensland. The Police Act 1863 centralised the system under a Police Commissioner, and in 1864 the Victorian model was applied to the police force. The ranks of Chief, District and Mounted Constables were replaced with those of Inspector, Sub-Inspector, Sergeant and Constable. The Police Department was a sub-department of the Home Secretary until its 1952 move to the Health and Home Affairs portfolio. It was shifted around in the 1950s and 1960s, until the Police Act 1970 created a separate Police Department. The Police Commissioner at the time the first Police Station was established in Pomona (1927) was William H. Ryan (January 1925 to May 1934), and he appears to have also pushed for the building of the 1934 Police Station and court house. During the building of the latter in late 1934, Cecil James Carroll was Commissioner (May 1934 to July 1949). Carroll reorganised the police force, and increased its numbers, efficiency and morale. Pomona had been agitating for a police station since at least 1910. In February of that year, the manager of the Commercial Bank of Australia at Pomona wrote to the Home Secretary complaining that the nearest police officer was in Tewantin. The two banks at Pomona were the only permanent banks between Emundi and Gympie, and held in cash between them. Also in February 1910, Eugene Von Blanckensee, a carpenter and local Justice of the Peace, wrote that Pomona needed a police station. The only response was that the town was visited by an officer from Nambour each Monday, and by one from Gympie each Thursday. Police Commissioner William G. Cahill (April 1905 to December 1916) did not act on the recommendation of Maryborough District Inspector Marrett to temporarily station an officer at Pomona until a station was built at Cooroy. Marrett had recommended a police station in Cooroy in December 1909, giving as a reason the rapid development of the area in the preceding two years. Pomona was persistent, however. In June 1910 a Pomona delegation consisting of A.P. Curran, J.W Napier, and J.J. Wilkinson travelled to Brisbane to see John Appel, the Home Secretary, to press their case for a police station. In July 1910 Maryborough District Inspector P. Short reported that Pomona's location was roughly halfway between Cooroy and Cooran, and halfway between Gympie and Nambour, and that it was from nearest policeman at Tewantin. Short noted that the Noosa Shire's population was rapidly increasing due to timber getting, and the influx of settlers and their labour; that undesirables were also passing through Pomona on their way to Gympie; and that Pomona had two banks, two butchers, two stores, a hotel, a state school and a newspaper. Short offered several potential central sites in Pomona for a police station. However, although both Cooran and Cooroy had police stations by 1920, Pomona was still lacking. In November 1926, Maryborough District Inspector J. Mann recommended a station at Pomona, and Commissioner Ryan visited Cooran and Pomona on 15 April 1927. On 22 April 1927 Constable Howie from Cooran reported that a Mr Blanckensee was willing to build a house for the police in return for a 3-year lease. He needed 3 months notice to build it, and could rent it to the police for 27 shillings and 6p per week (by June the price was 30 shillings). The offer would stand to 1 August 1927. The Police Commissioner recommended this offer to the Home Secretary in June 1927. On 9 July 1927, Pomona residents became indignant when the Co-op Stores and Hanlon's Store were broken into, and this may have prompted the police to accept Blanckensee's offer on 23 July 1927. Blanckensee built a four-room house with kitchen, bathroom and front and back verandas, along with a stable and feed-room, on his of land at Sub 32 of allotments 1 and 2, Section 3. The house still stands behind the current police precinct, at 1 Railway Parade. On 3 September 1927 the vacancy for an officer at Pomona was advertised in the Police Gazette, and the new police station was rented from 1 October 1927, in the name of Ivy Elizabeth Von Blanckensee, for 30 Shillings per week. On 10 October 1927 a Short Lee-Enfield rifle and revolver, baton, tools, horse tack, a lantern, pouches and other equipment was requisitioned for the Pomona Police Station, opened on 3 November 1927 by Constable Harry England Brown (stationed at Pomona until 1932). On 27 May 1927, the Noosa Advocate reported a visit to the area by Attorney General John Mullan and Undersecretary to the Department of Justice, G. Carter. They were deciding on a site for a Court of Petty Sessions in the Noosa Shire, and local businessmen promoted Pomona as a central location in the butter, timber and banana producing area. Both Pomona and Cooroy had lobbied for a court in 1915. In December 1927 Constable Brown wrote that since Pomona had been appointed by the Governor on 15 December 1927 to hold Courts of Petty Sessions, starting on 2 January 1928, it would need a cell. A removable single-cell lock-up and an earth closet were built by the Department of Public Works on Blanckensee's property by 9 September 1928. On 11 January 1928 Under Secretary G.A. Carter accepted an offer from the Pomona School of Arts, built in 1926, to permit the Acting Clerk of Petty Sessions (Constable Brown) to use the office attached to the School of Arts. The weekly rent would be 7 shillings and 6p, with free use of the hall for court sessions. By July 1930 Constable Brown was complaining that this arrangement lacked privacy, that a new station and court house was needed, and that the current 30 Shillings per week rent for Blanckensee's house was too high. In August 1930 Commissioner Ryan recommended the idea of a new station and court house to the Home Secretary, given that Pomona was at the centre of the Cooroy, Cooran and Tewantin Divisions, and that the Court of Petty Sessions was held there. Since January 1928, 63 people had been arrested at Cooran, Cooroy, Tewantin, and Pomona, and 24 Police summons cases had been dealt with. Ryan stated that Pomona was important as a farming and dairying centre, and suggested building on the Police Reserve at Pomona. However, in October 1930 the Blanckensee lease was instead renewed for 3 years, at the reduced rate of 27 shillings and 6p; the amount first suggested by Blanckensee in April 1927. Brown tried again in December 1932, shortly before Constable Robert H. Sabien, who was to be stationed at Pomona until 1940, replaced him. Brown argued that since the Blanckensee lease would expire in October 1933, a new police station and court house, a second cell, a stable and an earth closet should be built. He mentioned that the earth closet and single cell lock-up from the Blanckensee property could be reused. With regard to his current Court of Petty Sessions office, he stated he had \\"put up with\\" a lot of interruptions in the previous 5 years, because of the use of School of Arts hall by community groups during the day. The number of people appearing before Queensland's magistrate's courts fell from 30,000 to 25,000 between 1930 and 1933, only to increase to 35,000 by 1939. On 26 April 1933 a memorandum to the Under Secretary of the Home Department reported that about 2 and a half roods of suitable land had been found from the railway station, near the 1927 police station. The owner, L. Horrocks, wanted for it. The memorandum stated that the Police Reserve on the South West of Pomona was from the business centre, which could be a problem when moving \\"obstreperous\\" prisoners. By this time the Court of Petty Sessions office at the School of Arts was being provided at no cost to the Police. By October 1933 Blanckensee was only willing to renew the lease on the station for a minimum of 2 years, as he claimed that other tenants were interested. However, the Police seem to have gained an extension for a year, since the final lease was set to expire on September 30, 1934. On 13 June 1934 the Department of Public Works commenced construction of a police station/residence, two-cell lock-up, court house and stable. Three carpenters and one labourer were put on the job, and it was estimated that the work would take about 10 weeks. In the end, work was completed by 31 August 1934, and Blanckensee's house was vacated on 1 September the new police station being occupied the same day. In October 1934 the Department of Public Works gave Police Commissioner Carroll official notice that Job , ordered on 3 April 1934, had been completed at a cost of . This notification seems to only apply to the police station/residence itself, as an identical station was erected at Mitchelton in Brisbane in 1935 for . The court house apparently cost . In July 1932 Assistant Supervising Architect of the Department of Public Works, Harold James Parr had designed the plans for the Police Station, Type Two, erected at Pomona. Records indicate that sixteen Type Two stations were built in Queensland in the 1930s. The Type Two was high-set, with wooden weatherboards, an office , three bedrooms at , a living room of , and a kitchen of . It came with a stove recess, pantry, bathroom, open verandas on two sides, an enclosed veranda to rear, two 1000-gallon water tanks on stands next to the house, and a laundry under the kitchen. Pre-World War II police stations commonly combined an office and a residence, especially in rural areas. Accommodation problems had always been rife in the 19th century and early 20th century Queensland Police Force with the Queensland Government being slow to provide money. During the 1930s Great Depression the police were also responsible for distributing unemployed relief, and most stations needed more office space to administer the Intermittent Relief System. Until 2004, only small changes had been made to the 1934 precinct. In 1940 Constable James Elstob (1940-1942) made a request to garage his private car under the house, noting it would be from the cells, from the court house, and from the stables. In 1951 Sergeant 2/c F.S. Tapsell, (1946-1951) wrote that the buildings had been painted externally, but that the five main rooms of the residence had never been painted internally and were in sore need of it. In 1956 Sergeant 2/c P.H. Gimpel, (1951-1960) requested minor repairs and additions, for example mosquito and frog-proofing of all water tanks, an awning over the back entrance landing of the residence, and repairs to the two earth closets. Also in 1956, the stationing of a motorcycle outfit in Pomona led to a request by Gimpel to modify the disused stable by enclosing the front of the stable, and adding a door. The bottom portion of the wall at the rear of the stable would have to be removed, a double door erected, and a concrete floor laid. In 1965 and 1967 Senior Constable Alan Walker (1964‚Äì67) requested a septic system, and in 1968 this request was repeated by Senior Constable Luis Olsen (1968‚Äì73), who also asked that the back entrance landing be enclosed, as well as part of east veranda, where rain was beating against the doors into the main bedroom and the lounge. Pomona was a two-man station between 1949 and 1963, and there was a second police residence somewhere in Pomona. A 1963 report on staffing at Pomona by the Maryborough Inspectors Office said that one officer had managed the station for 10 months between mid 1961 and the end of 1962 and that it was possible to reduce Pomona to a one-man station again, especially since the new Bruce Highway had bypassed Pomona in December 1962. The report also noted that Courts of Petty sessions were held at Pomona for the Police divisions of Pomona, Cooran, Cooroy and Tewantin. A Stipendiary Magistrate was stationed at Gympie, and visited when required. In 1987 the Magistrates Court moved to Noosa Heads, and the lock-up ceased its role around that time. It is now a Registered Property Point for police storage. The court house is still in use 3 days per week (Tuesday to Thursday), and the Pomona Court Registrar handles civil matters such as small claims, minor debt claims and claims, pre- trail hearings and payment of court fines as well as other general government matters including Registrar-General work and business name applications. Most work is done through the mail. In 2001 the court had a civil jurisdiction of 12000 people, in Cooran, Cooroy, Kin Kin, Pinbarren, and Pomona. In 1963 Sergeant G. Williams (1961-1963) had requested a lowset office, as the steps up to the 1934 station's office posed a problem for the elderly and the drunk. However, it wasn't until 2004 that construction began on a new lowset concrete block police station, between the old station and the court house.  Description  Police lock-up The Pomona Police and Court House precinct, Lot 4, P50113, covers 3297 square metres and currently contains ten structures and an impound yard. The rectangular court house fronts Red Street, and further west the police residence (& former station) also fronts Red Street, with a side path to the office entering from Rectory Street. A new concrete block police station has been constructed between these two buildings. The 1934 lock-up lies behind the 1934 station, to the north. The lowset weatherboard lock-up, of standard government design, consists of two cells, an oversail veranda enclosed by a steel grill, and a galvanized corrugated steel roof with lead head nails. The lock- up stands on concrete stumps. The cells have steel doors and observation ports, with barred windows above the doors, and barred rear windows, and are lined with horizontal, unpainted boards with steel tongue inserts between them. The exterior is painted a standard government colour. Judging from its construction it is possible that it pre-dates 1934, and that it was relocated to the Pomona site. Pomona Court House, 2015 The court house is highset and clad in weatherboard, standing on concrete perimeter stumps and tubular steel centre stumps. It has timber framed window hoods clad with corrugated steel, over glass louvres, and casement windows, which have been painted white for privacy. It has vented gable ends, front and rear, with fixed louvres at the apex. Its eves are unlined, with a ventilation gap at the top of the walls. It has a wooden access ramp leading to the office at the rear of the court house, and a front veranda. Its interior is clad in vertical board, and the courtroom contains the original wooden magistrates bench, witness stand and dock. A small storage room is at the back of the courtroom. The 1934 police residence is also clad in weatherboard and highset on concrete perimeter posts, with the same window hoods and casement windows as the court house. Its L-shaped veranda has been enclosed. A front gable contains the office, reached by side stairs leading to projecting gabled portico. A rear gable contains the kitchen. The original design contained three bedrooms and a living room, and an enclosed veranda with sliding sashes between the kitchen and bathroom at the rear of the house, but we were unable to inspect the current interior. Front and rear stairs rise parallel to the house, leading to the front veranda and rear door, respectively. Externally, apart from the enclosed verandas, the removal of the 1000-gallon water tanks, and the angle of the stairs to the office, it closely resembles the original 1932 architect's plans. There is an unused weatherboard Earth Closet east of the lock-up. In addition there is a weatherboard shed facing Rectory Street, which is possibly the old stable that was recommended for conversion to motorcycle storage around 1956, although locals suggest that the stable was a different structure, now removed. The current shed has a casement/sash window facing the street, a single pitch skillion roof, and is timber framed and lined, with a double wooden door to the rear, and a recent roller door. Half of the shed stands on concrete stumps, with half constructed on a concrete slab. Modern Pomona Police Station, 2015 Vegetation on the property includes two large palm trees and one smaller palm in front of the 1934 police residence, and a bottle tree in front of the 1934 court house. A tubular pipe fence with wire mesh runs around the property, although sections have been removed from in front of the new station building, and a construction entrance off Rectory Street. The new concrete block police station, the concrete block toilets behind the court house, the old chicken-pen of recycled timber and corrugated iron (1980s) to the east of the impound yard, the new aluminium shed to the west of the lock-up, and the small garage facing Rectory Street, south of weatherboarded shed mentioned above, are not of cultural heritage significance.  Heritage listing  The Pomona Police residence (& former station), lock-up and court house were listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 May 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The place illustrates the relationship between the evolution of the site and the history of the development of the Pomona township and the Noosa Shire. The changes to the site also reflect changes within Police and Justice Department policies and practices. In addition, the site illustrates the use of standard building types developed by the Department of Public Works as an economical means to build symbols of \\"law and order\\" in developing townships. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. This grouping of three government buildings, built in the same year, on the same site, is important in demonstrating the principle characteristics of, and is a substantially intact example of, a small town police station / court house group, and the work of the Department of Public Works, including the development of various building \\"types\\". The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As a substantially intact 1930s police station / court house group, the site is evocative of a past era of law enforcement in a small country town. The buildings including the police residence (& former station), court house and lock-up, although of modest intentions, are a good example of this type of work undertaken by the Department of Public Works, including attention to the requirements of the subtropical climate. The Interior of the court house (particularly the courtroom) is substantially intact and includes purpose built court house furniture for the courtroom, office, and verandahs. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The precinct has a strong, ongoing association with the local community. Pomona went through a determined process of lobbying for a police station, and the precinct has played, and continues to play, its role of providing the essential functions of law and justice.

It was built from 1929 onwards. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 April 2009.  History  Noosa River Caravan Park is located between Russell Street and the Noosa River at Noosaville at a site known as Munna Point. It was established in 1956 as a reserve for camping and recreation under the trusteeship of the Noosa Shire Council. Previously the land had been reserved for public purposes from 1884 and camping on the site is recorded from . As motorised transport became dominant and leisure time increased, particularly post-World War II, this site was established as a caravan park to meet the needs of the growing number of caravanning holiday-makers whose destination was the North Coast. Its still-water river-side location, easily accessible by car from the major Tewantin to Noosa road, and its range of accommodation and amenities, which have evolved over time, demonstrate all the features of a typical caravan park. This site was originally part of a Reserve for Aboriginal Mission Purposes that extended from a point east of Tewantin to Noosa Heads following the Noosa River, and south along the coastline, as shown on an 1871 cadastral map. One early settler in the area recorded that Munna Point was a favourite camping place and fishing spot for indigenous people and a corroborree site. The Aboriginal Mission Reserve was cancelled in 1878 and a Noosa Heads township was gazetted in the following year. In 1884 an 80-acre Reserve for Public Purposes, which incorporated all of Munna Point including the future site of the Reserve for Camping and Recreation, was declared. The North Coast region began to develop as a holiday destination at the end of the 19th century but poor access inhibited its growth. Tewantin, Maroochydore and Caloundra developed as recreational destinations from the 1880s. This reflected the preferences of the Victorian era for a calm shallow stretch of river or still-water seaside location which allowed safe bathing, boating and fishing. Camping along rivers and on reserves occurred especially over the Christmas-New Year period. All three settlements remained small before World War I, used mainly by their small hinterland populations rather than visitors from Brisbane. North Coast tourists arrived by train at stations between Landsborough and Cooroy before using local forms of motorised transport to reach coastal destinations from railway stations between Landsborough to Cooroy. Tewantin was the largest of the three owing to its pre-existing role as a port settlement serving Gympie and the local timber industry. As transport networks improved accessibility, the resort settlements became more popular. During the interwar period Tewantin remained more prominent than its neighbouring settlement at Noosa Heads and it continued to be important even after vehicular access was opened to Noosa Heads in 1929. Tewantin was the commercial centre and most holiday facilities were located there. A wooden swimming enclosure was located in the river adjacent to the wharves on the western bank at Tewantin from as early as 1915. The Parkyn family had a jetty, boat hire and bait business upstream from the later site of the Lake Doonella Bridge. North Coast tourist development was fostered by substantial improvements to the region's road transport network during the interwar period. From the early 1920s, road works by local councils and the Main Roads Commission improved connections between inland and coastal settlements. Improved road access from Brisbane and inland towns during the 1930s increased the popularity of the North Coast as a resort. During the 1930s most of the Bruce Highway to Nambour was bituminised. The construction of the bridges and road linking Tewantin and Noosa boosted the latter's prospects and the settlement was gazetted as a township in 1930. The opening in 1929 of the Doonella Bridge at Tewantin over Lake Doonella and the Weyba Creek Bridge instigated development at Noosaville and Munna Point. Tewantin businessman Jack Parkyn, who owned the launch Miss Tewantin, diverted the boat from her previous major use as a down-river ferry to carrying tourist groups on cruises as far up the river and its lake system as Boreen Point. He purchased land at the more easterly section of Noosaville, known as Munna Point, where he developed a holiday complex. Additionally, he bought other individual allotments in the Noosaville area where he constructed holiday houses and flats. On a block of allotments in Russell Street, Munna Point, he erected a complex consisting of a row of six holiday homes, which proved to be very successful, and a general store to provide items needed by local residents and the holidaymakers who were staying in his houses. Fishing was a very popular pastime on the Noosa River and Jack Parkyn encouraged visitors holidaying in his houses to participate in this sport by providing a rowing boat with each holiday house he let an entrepreneurial action that was well received by his patrons. The advent of personal motor transport increased in interest in camping and caravanning by holidaymakers in the downstream reaches of the river. On the side of Russell Street opposite his holiday house complex in Munna Point, Jack Parkyn began clearing the existing reserve to open it for these purposes. Undergrowth was cleared to prevent the breeding of midges. With the establishment of the Munna Point venture, visitor numbers to the facility continued to increase. With the considerable growth of car ownership during the interwar period caravans began appearing on Queensland roads. Caravans offered freedom for the affluent motor tourist, without sacrificing comfort. As a \\"home away from home\\", fitted with modern conveniences, caravans were markedly different from the simplicity of camping under a canvas tent. Caravans were an alternative to local hotels and guesthouses, the latter being in high demand during peak seasons, and providing varying levels of quality. Post-World War II the popularity of caravans became more noticeable as the tourist industry resumed its pre-war expansion predicated on improved roads. In 1946, The Road Ahead was noting the numbers of motor tourists from Victoria and New South Wales holidaying in Queensland. There was estimated to be 12,000 caravans on Australia roads by 1948/49. The Caravan Club of Australia was formed in 1948 and a Brisbane branch had been established by 1951, offering advice to visitors. The Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) fostered the popularity of caravanning in Queensland by pushing for changes to restrictive road laws and improved caravanning facilities. The 1950 Queensland Traffic Act limited cars towing caravans to , compared to 50 for cars. By 1960 this speed had been lifted to 40. From 1949 when increasing numbers of caravans were appearing on North Coast roads the RACQ was urging local authorities on tourist routes to provide 'well equipped camps \\"to prepare for the boom\\". In 1954, RACQ Secretary Len King drew attention to the poor state of Queensland's caravan parks, noting that the average caravanner spent in the local area in which they stayed. King accompanied the Club's vice-president J.M Marshall on a tour to north Queensland, with the objective of demonstrating to local authorities and the press the lack of adequate provisions for caravanning tourists. The club published Modern Caravan Parks offering advice to local authorities and others interested in establishing caravan parks. The growth of motor tourism during the 1950s was stimulated by the lifting of petrol rationing by the Menzies government, the increased affordability of cars for the wider population and longer paid holidays. Other factors that influenced the development of tourism on the Sunshine Coast were the popular taste for beach holidays and population growth in South-East Queensland. This in turn influenced the number of caravan users and development of caravan parks. Development of the Noosa area was boosted by the opening of the coastal road (David Low Way) in 1960 linking the main resorts at Caloundra, Maroochydore and Noosa. Intrinsically linked to the rise of motor transport and improved roads were caravan parks. From the late 1930s, private developers were the first to offer caravan parks with modern facilities and structured layout. By 1960, a mix of public and private parks had been established on what was becoming known as the Sunshine Coast. The site of Noosa River Caravan Park (about ) was reserved as a Reserve for Caravan and Camping Purposes in 1956 by its excision from the Reserve for Public Purposes at Munna Point. This early reservation of the Noosa River Caravan Park as a caravan and camping reserve places it at the vanguard of the caravanning period. Queensland caravan registration figures increased substantially from 2320 in 1953 to 5406 in 1961. Caravan manufacturers and saleyards (at least 18 in Brisbane by 1960) took their place on outer suburban commercial strips. Rental and second hand vans were common. In the early 1950s, relatively few sites in Queensland offered the necessary infrastructure to accommodate caravanning needs. Calls for improvements to sites and facilities accompanied increased caravan usage. Advocates looked to the United States and the United Kingdom for examples of best practice in caravan parks. Caravanning guides and journals offered suggestions for layout and features. These were a more formal arrangement of space than camping, characterised by grid or circular layouts and landscaped grounds. Features common to caravan parks include location near a main road, a prominent entrance, on-site caretakers/proprietors, recreation room, levelled concrete slabs, landscaped grounds, hose connections, electricity, large amenities block with washing machines and hot showers. Many parks offered on-site vans for rental. Park listings in 1961 record \\"tradespeople\\" calling to parks, to deliver essentials like bread and milk. Continual updating of facilities in caravan parks has also been a common trend. Development of private and public caravan parks expanded during the 1960s. An inspection by RACQ club officials in 1962 of the state's caravan and camping grounds noted the progress through local government efforts, especially advancements by privately owned parks. Many council camping grounds became known as \\"caravan parks\\" as site facilities became more geared to their use. Over time, investment in facilities at Council-operated caravan parks increased as tourism came to play a greater economic role in the region. In 1966 a new amenities block was finished at Munna Point and it was decided by the Noosa Shire Council to bring rates for use in line with those of Noosa Heads and Tewantin \\"in view of campers using additional electrical appliances there was a necessity to review scale of charges\\" according to Shire Health Inspector. On the coastal strip between Noosa and Caloundra in 1968, there were 24 sites operating as caravan parks and five out of the six council camping reserves offered facilities for caravans, including power. This was a significant increase since 1960, marking the decade as a high point for caravan park development on the Sunshine Coast. By the 1970s, caravanning was a well established and common leisure practice. A self-contained holiday in a caravan became an annual ritual for many campers, often returning to the same park year after year, members of a holiday community linked by shared experiences of place. After private houses, caravans were the most popular form of holiday accommodation in Australia in 1976. They were significant contributors to local economies in tourist regions, through accommodation fees and flow on effects to other local businesses. During the last 25 years development on the North Coast has been especially rapid with the population of the Sunshine Coast growing at around twice the rate of the State as a whole. The Sunshine Coast is now Queensland's third largest tourist destination in terms of holiday accommodation after the Gold Coast and Cairns. This has meant that although there is still strong demand for caravan park accommodation, there is also increased pressure for these strategically and attractively located, relatively undeveloped sites to be utilised for other accommodation types or returned to parkland. The closure of caravan parks in coastal areas began in the 1970s as more intensive commercial and residential development occurred in the region. In 2007, there are 16 caravan parks remaining on the coastal strip and no council camping reserves. At Munna Point the bulk of the Reserve for Public Purposes adjacent to the Noosa River Caravan Park was cut up for development in 1980 and this land has subsequently become the site of apartment blocks. Noosa River Caravan Park has continued to operate as affordable riverside holiday accommodation amidst the extensive development on the Sunshine Coast. Future land use of caravan park sites, particularly on Crown land, remains a contentious topic. Local communities and visitors have come to attach special significance to caravan parks as places of leisure as has been demonstrated by their efforts to protect council-operated caravan parks on Crown land. The significance of this site as a social space and place of leisure for visitors and the local community has a long history. As a site intrinsically linked to the development of tourism in Noosa Shire since the 1920s at least, it is an important part of Queensland's cultural heritage.  Description  Caravans at the Noosa River Caravan Park, 2007 Occupying of waterfront land off Russell Street at Noosaville, the Noosa River Caravan Park is a green and leafy site with grassed areas and scatterings of trees, shrubs and hedges on the sandy river front at Munna Point. Bounded by the Noosa River to the northwest and Weyba Creek to the northeast, the park offers expansive views up and down the Noosa River and across to Noosa Sound. The park offers powered and unpowered van and tent sites, river front beaches and a day picnic area. Facilities include a large open camp kitchen shed, a boat ramp access to Noosa River and two masonry amenities blocks. A caretaker's residence and office stand near the entrance off Russell Street. There are a number of parking spaces along the northwest side of the spine road. The park is organised off a spine road which runs the length of the site with finger roadways running off to the southeast. The powered van sites each front a finger roadway and have a concrete slab to accommodate a van. There are a number of unpowered van sites to the northeast end off the circular roadway that terminates the spine. Running along the river side of the spine road from the park entrance there are the day picnic area, boat ramp and an unpowered tent area terminating at the beach at the north end. A number of powered tent sites are located to the rear of the park at the northeast and south ends. The grassed and treed day picnic area fronts the sandy edge of the Noosa River and accommodates picnic tables, BBQs and a fish gutting table. There is no permanent accommodation offered (maximum stay is three months) and the park does not offer on-site cabins or vans.  Heritage listing  Noosa River Caravan Park was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 3 April 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Noosa River Caravan Park is important in demonstrating the pattern of development of the Sunshine Coast, an important region for the development of seaside tourism in Queensland. Originally designated as part of an 80-acre reserve for public purposes in 1884, the Noosa River Caravan Park has sustained its land use as a camping/caravan park from at least the 1920s and is important evidence of the pattern of development of the tourist industry on the Sunshine Coast. The Noosa River Caravan Park illustrates the policy of colonial governments of reserving Crown land for public camping and recreation purposes in prime waterside areas, a practice which was common, but is now rare. The Noosa River Caravan Park is important in demonstrating the evolution of tourist accommodation on the Sunshine Coast, an historically important region for the development of caravan parks in Queensland. It does this through its beginnings a riverside camping ground dating from the 1920s, then as a caravan park created at the vanguard of the boom period for caravanning and later through periodic updating of its facilities in response to contemporary demands. The site was intrinsically linked to the phenomenon of caravanning that resulted from the rise of mass motoring Australia-wide in the second half of the 20th century. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Noosa River Caravan Park represents a land use and custom that has made a strong contribution to the pattern and evolution of Queensland's tourism history. It is an excellent example of a camping and caravanning site that has been used by Queensland holiday-makers since the 1920s. Located adjacent to an area of quiet water allowing easy access for swimming, boating and fishing activities, Noosa River Caravan Park is important in illustrating the essential characteristics of early camping reserves. Noosa River Caravan Park demonstrates the principal characteristics of a waterside caravan park. On a prime waterfront location with immediate access to still water, the place offers opportunities to interact with, and appreciate the natural beauty of its setting. Easily accessed by motor vehicles, and organised around a simple grid of streets and landscaping, the Park offers a range of accommodation types, which are served by a range of facilities that include ablutions blocks, barbeques and picnic areas. The range of accommodation and amenities has evolved over time to meet the changing needs of its clientele, while remaining low-scale and relatively affordable for holidaymakers.

It was built from 1880s to 1920s. It is also known as Bay View and Hillcrest Guest House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 April 1997.  History  Bayview House Hillcrest Guest House, 1928 Hillcrest Guest House, 1940 Halse Lodge, formerly known as Bayview, then as Hillcrest Guest House, is a two-storeyed timber guest house which was substantially rebuilt during the 1920s. The site of Halse Lodge has been associated with boarding/guest house accommodation from the early 1880s. Halse Lodge is the only guest house in Noosa Heads to survive from the 1920s and is one of few sites in south east Queensland which has operated continuously as a seaside guest house from the late nineteenth century. The land on which Bayview was erected was granted to James Forsyth, and comprised . Title records indicate that although the land was purchased in 1871, the register was not actually signed until December 1880. The land was transferred to Walter Hay, reputedly Forsyth's cousin, in 1881. According to family records, Hay had moved into the Wide Bay district during the 1850s, and by 1867 he leased the ferry which crossed the Mary River between Maryborough and Tinana. During the late 1860s, Hay moved to Tiaro where he ran a steamer between Maryborough and Tiaro carrying goods for Gympie and Kilkivan. By 1870, a more direct route was sought for the transportation of goods into Gympie, and Hay is credited with successfully finding/marking a route from Gympie to the Noosa River and the subsequent establishment of the town of Noosa. Lands Department records indicate that the name Nusa was used on Ham's map of Queensland published in 1871. Hay acquired a large amount of land in the Tewantin-Noosa area, and by the 1880s was described as one of the largest land holders in the area. Hay placed an advertisement in the Gympie Times in March 1882, advertising that the house known as Bay View was available for letting. Situated on the South Head at the mouth of the Noosa River, Bay View was described as containing 10 rooms on five acres of fenced-in land. During the 1890s, the property was leased to Robert Walker, then to Heinrich Walkmann. Bayview was progressively enlarged, and according to local history sources, Bayview was one of two guest houses operating in Noosa by the turn of the century; the other being Laguna House located in Hastings Street. Photographic evidence indicates that by 1900, Bayview comprised a two-storeyed timber building with a detached structure at the rear. It is assumed that this forms the basis of the present building. Title records indicate that the property was transferred to Charles Miles of Brisbane in 1904, then to Francis Henry Atkinson (Hay's half-brother) in 1910. It is understood that Hay's second wife Susannah assisted Francis to run Bayview. Susannah's involvement however is not recorded on title documents, which indicate that the property was acquired by John Donovan in 1918. Bayview was substantially rebuilt and extended during the 1920s, after which time it was known as Hillcrest Guest House. The property was subdivided in 1925; Leslie Hay acquired Sub 1 of Portion 171 which comprised just over . The property was transferred to John Jones in 1929, and it is understood that the Jones and Hindmarsh families continued to run the guest house until the late 1950s. The gradual development of Noosa as a tourist resort during the early twentieth century, increased during the 1920s as cafes and accommodation houses were erected along the beachfront (Hastings Street). The rise in car ownership, and increase in the amount of time people had available for leisure during the 1920s and 1930s meant that Noosa, like other coastal areas in south east Queensland, grew in popularity as a focal point for resort and recreation. A 1944 guest book from Hillcrest indicates that guests came from Brisbane, elsewhere in Queensland, interstate and overseas; a number of guests were sufficiently inspired by the house and its setting to record their impressions in verses and sketches. Hillcrest Guest House was acquired by the Anglican Church in 1959, and renamed Halse Lodge, after Archbishop Reginald Halse. By this time the property included just over of land. Between 1959 and 1988 few alterations were undertaken to the building, which was used mainly for group accommodation of up to 80 people. Halse Lodge was leased to managers in 1988. Substantial renovations to Halse Lodge were undertaken in 1988 under the supervision of architects Hurst and Harris, including the additions of a new front entry and kitchen block, demolition and erection of a new ablutions wing, refitting and re-roofing the caretaker's wing, erection of a new activity centre. Minor alterations were also undertaken to the main buildings, including reopening the verandah at the rear of the dining room, and the addition of internal doors to some of the upstairs rooms. Halse Lodge is presently operated as a guest house and has a capacity of around 60 people. The name of the town was changed from Noosa to Noosa Heads in 1988. As a consequence of the ongoing development of Noosa Heads as a tourist resort, the Hastings Street streetscape and Noosa Heads townscape have undergone many changes, including the demolition of the timber guest houses which formerly lined the street; Laguna House was demolished in the 1960s.  Description  Halse Lodge, a two-storeyed timber guesthouse with a hipped corrugated iron roof, is located on a northwestern rise overlooking Noosa, the Noosa River and Laguna Bay to the northwest. The building is approached via a long driveway from Noosa Drive to the west. The building has a U-shaped plan with a south facing courtyard flanked by a two- storeyed accommodation wing to the northwest, a single-storeyed caretaker's residence wing to the southwest and a two-storeyed amenities wing to the northeast. The three wings are connected via open verandahs at ground level, and the building has concrete stumps with timber batten infill. The main entry is located centrally on the southwest, with a steep pitch projecting gable above a timber stair and timber ramp entry. The gable has paired corner posts with shaped timber brackets, and a timber batten tympanum. The accommodation wing has verandahs to both levels on the northwest and southwest. The ground level has a timber batten balustrade, timber posts and shaped brackets, a chamferboard valance, single-skin exposed framed walls, and multi-paned and dual-paned French doors with fanlights. The first floor, accessed via a timber stair on the southwest verandah, has a weatherboard balustrade with open timber batten panels with shaped timber surrounds, timber posts, unlined raked ceilings, single-skin exposed framed walls, and dual-paned French doors with timber batten fanlights. The northeast end of the accommodation wing has the first floor at ground level, with a timber ramp access, and a verandah which has been enclosed with casement windows. The rear wall of this wing has weatherboard cladding, with casement windows with timber and corrugated iron window hoods to the first floor, and a verandah at ground level. A single- storeyed kitchen has been added to the southwest of this wing, and has weatherboard cladding, casement windows with timber and corrugated iron window hoods, concrete block stumps and contains commercial kitchen equipment. Internally, this wing has a large dining room at ground level, and bedrooms at the first floor level. The dining room has three ante-rooms opening onto the northwest verandah, vertically jointed boarding to the walls, fibrous cement sheeting with cover strips to the ceiling and upper walls, arctic glass to the casement windows and French doors, and a timber batten arch opening to the central ante-room. The first floor contains a central corridor with rooms opening either side, and a foyer area at the northeast with a timber ramp access to the garden. Internal doors have timber batten fanlight panels, and ceilings are boarded. The single-storeyed southwest caretaker's residence wing has weatherboard cladding, a large metal ridge ventilator, casement windows with timber and corrugated iron window hoods, and a small fenced courtyard at the rear. Internally, it has been refitted and currently contains two bedrooms, a bathroom, office, kitchenette and living area. The two-storeyed amenities wing has weatherboard cladding and casement windows. Internally, it contains a laundry to the ground level, and bathrooms to both levels. A high- set activity centre, with a hipped corrugated iron roof and concrete block stumps, is located to the south of the building. This structure is similar in materials and form to Halse Lodge, and has weatherboard cladding, casement windows and a verandah to the west. The grounds contain mature trees, including a large eucalypt near the western driveway entrance, and a mango tree to the southwest of the building. A terraced driveway and turning area has been established to the south of the building, with the ground sloping steeply to an overgrown gully and creek bed to the south and southwest.  Heritage listing  Halse Lodge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 30 April 1997 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Substantially rebuilt during the 1920s, and still in use as a guest house, Halse Lodge maintains its association with the site of guesthouse accommodation in Noosa Heads from the 1880s. As the only extant guest house in Noosa Heads from the 1920s, Halse Lodge is indicative of early twentieth century holiday accommodation, and is important in demonstrating the pattern of the development of Noosa Heads as a tourist resort. As the site of the former Bayview, Halse Lodge is associated with the Hay family in particular Walter Hay who was active in the settlement and development of the Noosa district from the late 1870s. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As the only extant guest house in Noosa Heads from the 1920s, Halse Lodge is indicative of early twentieth century holiday accommodation, and is important in demonstrating the pattern of the development of Noosa Heads as a tourist resort. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Located in an elevated position overlooking Noosa Heads, this two-storyed timber building is an important landmark in the Noosa Heads townscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Halse Lodge maintains a special association with the community, evidenced by the comments in guest books at the Lodge which, over several decades have changed little in their content and express the value and special qualities which Halse Lodge holds for its visitors.

Introduction Edirne, which was the Turkish capital till 1453, is positioned on the main transit route linking Europe and Asia Minor. Because the older part of city is positioned inside a large semi-circular loop in the Tundzha River, which at this point is wide but usually shallow, several stone arch bridges have been built to cross it to the north, west and south of the city. Starting from the north, and following the river's flow in an anti- clockwise direction, these bridges are as follows: Fatih Bridge Fatih Bridge (May 2015) The Fatih Bridge (\\"Fatih Fatih K√∂pr√ºs√º\\") linked the Sultan's Palace identified by the Adalet Tower (\\"Adalet Kasrƒ±\\") with the city. Most of the palace, which was built on a large island in the river, was destroyed in the nineteenth century but the tower remains in the Palace Gardens, which here form a large sandy island separating two branches of the river. The Fatih Bridge was built in 1452 during the reign of Mehmed II. The stone structure comprises three broad very slightly pointed arches, of which the middles arch is slightly larger than the other two. The three main arches are separated by two broad pillars each of which itself contains a narrow opening. Beneath the narrow openings the pillars of the bridge are supported on each side by stone buttresses with an approximately triangular footprint, designed to divert the main river current away from the pillars and under the arches: however, these are below the water level in the attached picture, which was taken in May when the water level can be relatively high. * Location: Kanuni Bridge Kanuni Bridge (May 2015) The Kanuni Bridge (\\"Kanuni K√∂pr√ºs√º\\") takes its name, like several important bridges in Turkey, from Suleiman the Magnificent (also known in Turkey as Suleiman Kanuni/Suleiman the Law Giver). It continues in a northerly direction the same route as the Fatih Bridge, crossing from the Palace Gardens Island in the middle of the river to the river's north shore. The Kanuni Bridge was built in 1553/54 during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent by the prolific architect and civil engineer Mimar Sinan. The bridge is a long gently vaulted structure over four very slightly pointed arches the lower portions of which are normally below the water surface, so that the visible parts of the arches appear very shallow. In contrast with the design of the Fatih Bridge of the previous century, there is on the Kanuni Bridge no opening in the pillars separating the four main arches. The pillars of the bridge are supported on each side by stone buttresses with an approximately triangular footprint designed to divert the main river current away from the pillars and under the arches. The bridge is long including the abutments at each end. Measured without the abutments it is long. The Kanuni Bridge was comprehensively restored in 2007. * Location: Sara√ßhane Bridge The Sara√ßhane Bridge (\\"Sara√ßhane K√∂pr√ºs√º\\") is named after the Beylerbey (Commander) of Rumelia. Rumelia was a Turkish province when the bridge was constructed in 1451. The Sara√ßhane Bridge is located directly downstream of the Palace Island. It is long and wide, crossing the river in a long low vaulted shape, supported by 10 arches of varying sizes. Like he Kanuni Bridge, the Sara√ßhane Bridge was comprehensively restored in 2007. * Location: Yalnizgoz and Bayezid Bridges Western section of the Yalnizgoz Bridge, with the Bayezid Bridge in the background (October 2014) The Yalnƒ±zg√∂z Bridge (\\"Yalnƒ±zg√∂z K√∂pr√ºs√º\\") and the Bayezid Bridge (\\"Bayezid K√∂pr√ºs√º\\") to is west link the Sultan Bayezid II K√ºlliye (mosque complex) with the city. The Bayezid Bridge is named after Bayezid II. The bridges are separated from one other by a small low sandy island in the middle of the river along which a stone causeway is routed. The Bayezid Bridge is the more substantial of the two. The Bayezid Bridge spans the main branch of the river, with 6 arches. It dates from 1488 and was the work of . The Yalnƒ±zg√∂z Bridge spans the lesser branch of the river and is part dam, part bridge. Along its length there is a single main arch, along with seven small arched openings. Most of the facade of the bridge comprises a stone dam wall, however, intended to regulate he river's propensity to sudden flooding. The Yalnizgoz Bridge was constructed in 1567. It was, like the Kanuni Bridge, the work of Mimar Sinan. * Location Bayezid Bridge: * Location Yalnizgoz Bridge: Gazi-Mihal Bridge Gazi Mihal Bridge, with the twentieth century steel-concrete road bridge in the background (October 2014) The Gazi Mihal Bridge (\\"Gazi Mihal K√∂pr√ºs√º\\") carried the main road from the centre of Edirne towards the west. It marks the location of an earlier Roman bridge of which only a few stones remain. During the fifteenth century a bridge was built at this point by the frontier warlord Mihal Bey. This was replaced in the nineteenth century by the present stone bridge, complemented during the twentieth century by a steel and concrete road bridge which runs parallel to the nineteenth-century bridge on its north side, and carries the modern D100 highway en route to the present frontier with Bulgaria. The nineteenth century stone bridge covers a span of , and consists of a series of stone arches. * Location: Rail bridge * a twentieth-century steel bridge a few hundred meters to the south of the Gazi Mihal Bridge carries the railway line across the Tundzha towards Bulgaria. Ekmekcioglu Ahmet Pasha Bridge Ekmekcioglu Ahmet Pasha Bridge The Ekmekcioglu Ahmet Pasha across the Tundzha River (often simply called the Tundzha Bridge) connects the centre of Edirne with the route to the south, today carrying the D100 Highway towards the frontier with the north-eastern tip of Greece. The bridge was originally constructed between 1607 and 1615. It comprises 8 stone arches, and has a total length of . Two of the arches were destroyed during the Second World War and replaced with temporary steel bridging structures. As part of a comprehensive restoration undertaken in 2007 the steel structures were replaced, however, and the bridge was returned to its earlier form. * Location: Meri√ß Bridge Meri√ß Bridge The Meri√ß Bridge (sometimes known simply as the New Bridge) carries the road from Edirne to Macedonia to the southwest. It is positioned directly to the south of the Ekmekcioglu Ahmet Pasha Bridge (Tundzha) Bridge. At this point, to the south of Edirne, the Tundzha River which loops around the old city, meets up with the Maritsa (Meri√ß) River. Directly before the rivers meet, for a couple of hundred meters they flow parallel to each other. It is here that the main highway south out of Edirne crosses both rivers, one after he other, using first the \\"Tundzha Bridge\\" and then the \\"New Bridge\\". The Meri√ß Bridge was opened in 1842, but its design follows that of the seventeenth century Tundzha Bridge. * Location: References * Category:Arch bridges in Turkey Category:Road bridges in Turkey * ","title":"Bridges of Edirne"},{"id":"48333654","text":"Christopher Hodges is an artist and art gallery director based in Sydney, Australia.Courtney Kidd, ‚ÄòUtopia Art Sydney: representing leading contemporary Australian artists‚Äô, Art and Australia, 39.4 (June‚ÄìAugust 2002), p598  Artistic career  Hodges studied art at the National Art School, Sydney and first began exhibiting his work in the late 1970s.Anne Sanders, 'Profile: Christopher Hodges', Artist Profile, Issue 22, 2013 His first solo exhibition was at Coventry Gallery, Sydney in 1979, and he has held over 30 solo exhibitions since then.

The site is located near Yingkou, Liaoning, China. Several new species of extinct birds were also discovered at the site. Jinniushan hominin The hominid fossils at Jinniushan all belong to one female individual. Initially, the fossils were believed to have belonged to a male specimen, since the fossils were so big. Later analysis shows that the fossil remains actually come from a female specimen. =Size= The Jinniushan specimen's body mass is estimated to be around , making it the largest female specimen ever discovered in the fossil record. The next largest female specimen ever discovered, found at Grotte du Prince, early Late Pleistocene, from around 100,000 BP, has an estimated body mass of . Body size in Homo reached its maximum during the Middle Pleistocene, so the size of the Jinniushan specimen is not surprising, especially since the specimen was found at a high latitude, cold climate location. In accordance with Allen's rule and Bergmann's rule, the large body, wide trunk, and short limbs of the Jinniushan female is to be expected, as the hominins from that time relied more on their physical body as a cold adaptation, as their technological culture was not yet as advanced as later hominins. =Description= The fossil elements at Jinniushan all belong to one female individual. The fossil remains consist of one cranium, six vertebrae (one cervical, five thoracic), one complete left os coxae, one complete left ulna, one complete left patella, two left ribs, and several hand and feet bones. =Comparison= The Jinniushan specimen belongs to an archaic human with mixed Homo erectus and Homo sapiens features. The Jinniushan specimen is similar to the Dali specimen, but more gracile, which can be explained by sexual dimorphism. The cranial vault and supraorbitals of the Jinniushan specimen are thinner than those of the Dali specimen. Jinniushan's external cranium is the same size as Dali's, but Jinniushan's bones are thinner, so the Jinniushan specimen has a larger brain capacity than the Dali specimen. Both specimens have flat and broad faces, a feature shared with the specimen from Hulu Cave, Nanjing; both also share some features with the Zhoukoudian and Yunxian specimens. Morphologically, archaic female and Neanderthal females are more similar to modern females than their male counterparts are to modern males. The similar morphologies imply that the birth mechanics of the Jinniushan hominin is probably similar to that of modern females. =Cranial capacity= The Jinniushan specimen's estimated cranial capacity is . The encephalization quotient (EQ) is estimated to be around 4.150. Both are typical of the rapidly increasing brain capacity and EQ found in other specimens from the Middle Pleistocene. Fauna Macaca robustus, Trogontherium, Megaloceros pachyosteus, Dicerorhinus mercki, and Microtus brandtioides fossils were found at Jinniushan. Several new species of extinct birds were also discovered, including Aegypius jinniushanensis and Leptoptilos l√ºi.

Arthur was born in Salisbury, South Australia to Edwin and Ann Short, n√©e Kerwin. Edwin was a son of Captain William Short H.E.I.C.S., and may also have served in the East India Company, Edwin here cited as commodore with H.E.I.C.; this distinction may have properly referred to his father. but had been chief officer on the Emma trading between Adelaide and Sydney. He married in Sydney in October 1842 and moved to South Australia the following January. They lived first in South Richmond, as did Edwin's father William, and in 1846 settled at Yankalilla, then around 1848 moved to \\"Courtwick Farm\\", Salisbury, where Arthur and his brother Albert excelled in athletics. In 1869 Edwin Short selected near Maitland and the Cocoanut [sic] Station, Kulpara which the boys managed alone until 1873 when the rest of the family moved to \\"The Cocoanut\\". Arthur was educated at a Grammar School.Reference in the article \\"An Eventful Life\\" to a Stevenson's Grammar School cannot be verified, nor can C. Goodenough Taplin's involvement in any school in the 1860s. His father, always an aggressive man, around 1860 following a blow to the head, began displaying erratic behaviour. He believed he was being persecuted by the Rymill brothers, Sir Henry Ayers and his own lawyers Way & Symon. He became so violent that in 1876 his wife petitioned for him to be admitted to the Adelaide Lunatic Asylum. Edwin Short appealed against his confinement, and was able to produce witnesses as to his sanity, but evidence given by his family and neighbours was compelling. This reference includes useful details of Short family history. Arthur had taken over management of the properties, and in 1880 was licensed as an auctioneer. When Maitland, Kilkerran, Moolywurtie, and Cunningham were formed into a district he was elected the first district clerk, later Maitland's first town clerk, and Mayor for a total of six years. He was elected to the South Australian House of Assembly seat of Yorke Peninsula and served from April 1893 to April 1896, succeeding Henry Lamshed as associate of Harry Bartlett. He stood again, but was beaten by William Copley. He left for Western Australia, where he ran an auctioneering business in Murray Street, Perth from 1898, then Hay Street. He contested the Western Australian Legislative Assembly seats of West Perth in 1900 and East Perth seat in 1901, but was unsuccessful. He filed for bankruptcy in 1904 and returned to South Australia sometime after mid-1906. In 1908 he applied for an auctioneer's licence in South Australia and again in 1916, then began auctioneering for Phillips & Co. of Franklin Street.

The project was named \\"Clark\\" for marketing purposes for potential investors in the area. This naming decision was made despite being located in Tarlac and not in Pampanga (the location of the already existing Clark Freeport Zone) due to the latter being more known to foreign investors. The BCDA compared this with the situation of the Subic Bay Freeport Zone, which was Olongapo and Morong, Bataan, and not in Subic, Zambales. During the Duterte administration, the planned city was renamed from \\"Clark Green City\\" to \\"New Clark City\\". History Groundbreaking ceremony. New Clark City, previously known as Clark Green City was first presented by the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) under the administration of then-president Arnel Casonova in 2012. The then-proposal was met with skepticism from some high-ranking government officials due to the development's proposed location being remote. Casanova envisioned a development with wide and tree-shaded pedestrian lanes. He also envisioned the development to be free of gated communities to discourage heavy traffic. The BCDA held a design competition for the master conceptual development plan for Clark Green City with AECOM coming up with the winning design in 2015. After the Casanova's tenure as BCDA ended he joined AECOM as the firm's representative in the Philippines. In March 2015, the Philippine Congress approved House Resolution 116 in support of Clark Green City. The development is under the BCDA. The BCDA signed a 50-year contract with Filinvest to develop the of land allocated for the project. BCDA also managed to make partnership with foreign firms to develop Clark Green City such as Japan Overseas Infrastructure Investment Corp. which plans to connect Clark Green City to Manila as well as surrounding cities by rail, and IVL Swedish Environmental Research Institute which will assist the BCDA to come up with \\"smart and disaster-resilient\\" features for the planned community. An agreement was also signed between Paris-based Vivapolis. =Groundbreaking and construction (2016-present)= The groundbreaking rites for New Clark City, led by then-President Benigno Aquino III was made on April 11, 2016.

Founded in 1944, it provides an education to approximately 693 students in the primary and secondary schools from Reception to Year 13 (4‚Äì18 years old, grades K‚Äì12). BMIS is an IB World School offering the International Baccalaureate¬Æ (IB) Primary Years (PYP), IB Middle Years (MYP) and IB Diploma (DP) Programmes. Additionally, BMIS is a fully accredited member of the Council of International Schools (CIS) and the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC).  History  The school was named in memory of Charles Mackenzie, a prominent figure in the early history of Malawi. He joined David Livingstone on the Zambezi in 1861 as Bishop of Central Africa and Head of the Anglican Universities Mission. Mackenzie died of malaria and the mission collapsed almost before it began; yet he helped create a vanguard for the abolition of the slave trade by means of Livingstone's much heralded \\"Commerce and Christianity\\". BMIS was founded in 1944 as The Lilongwe European School. Originally there were no more than a dozen pupils, with a single teacher, Miss Fairly, housed on the site of the Golf Club. In 1950, the school acquired its present location and experienced a period of growth. It became a boarding establishment throughout the then Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In 1959, the school changed its name to Bishop Mackenzie School (BMS). This reverted to a day school under the Nyasaland Government, and later provided boarding facilities again when the Government of Malawi placed BMS under the control of the Designated Schools Board (DSB) in 1977. In 1992, it expanded into secondary education with Form 1 (Year 7) and added to this annually. In 1995, the word \\"International\\" was added into the school's name giving the now-abbreviation BMIS. In 1998, the school separated from the Designated Schools Board and established itself as a trust under Malawi law. All parents are members of the parents' association, which constitutes the membership of the board of trustees. BMIS became an International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme-authorized school in 1997. The school expanded the IB programmes in 2006 introducing the Primary Years Programme (PYP), which was authorized in 2011. BMIS was fully authorized in 2013 to offer the IB Middle Years Programme (MYP) for secondary students in Years 7 - 11.  Academic curriculum  The school offers an education with the principal language of instruction being English. The school also offers specialist teachers for students for whom English is not their first language and need support in developing language acquisition to enable them to succeed in the classroom. Specialist teachers are also available for students who have special needs. The International Baccalaureate¬Æ (IB) Primary Years Programme (PYP) is for students aged 3‚Äì11. PYP has an emphasis on the holistic growth of the child during his/her developmental years. The program seeks to create an engaging and challenging educational framework for children. Five essential elements that are part of this curriculum are concepts, knowledge, skills, attitudes and action. The International Baccalaureate¬Æ (IB) Middle Years Programme (MYP): This program is for students between the ages of 11 and 16 years. Being a critical phase in most students' lives, this age requires a program which can help students to develop the knowledge and skills that are essential during the challenging times. The program focuses on five areas of interaction that are approaches to Learning, community and service, human ingenuity, environment and health and social education. The International Baccalaureate¬Æ (IB) Diploma Programme: This program is aimed for students between the ages 16 and 19. The program includes six subjects with three core parts: 1) creativity, activity and service; 2) extended essay; and 3) theory of knowledge.  After-school activities  The school offers a wide range of intellectual, cultural, sporting and service activities aimed at providing the students with an experience beyond their academic development. These are offered through the after-school activities programme, inter-house and interschool sports competitions, student council activities, and a community service programme. After school activities are run in two sessions in the afternoons; from 2pm to 3pm and then 3pm to 4pm. Swimming is a very popular activity, since the weather in the first and second terms allows for maximum use of the outside swimming pools. Football, basketball, rugby, and hockey are also popular sports, but the school also arranges tennis, karate, table tennis, ballet, chess, photo-club and a wide range of other activities to suit all interests and abilities. BMIS regularly competes with other schools in Lilongwe and further afield (often a 4‚Äì5 hour bus ride away) as well as international tournaments. In the Primary School, children take part in curriculum activities as well as after school programmes where they participate in fundraising and events with local charities, orphanages and community projects. The local Ndi Moyo, Operation Smile and Tilinanu orphanage are a few projects that the children are currently actively working on. Recently, children have also been involved in briquette making and recycling projects. They also frequently collaborate with less fortunate children in Lilongwe schools. Progressively through the school, students' involvements take on different perspectives as they mature and are able to not only participate, but actively organize events and activities. Community and service elements are built into the Middle Years and Diploma programmes.  Facilities  The school's campus is located on the southwestern edge of Lilongwe's Area 3, a settled area of suburban housing. The campus occupies ten hectares (approximately twenty-five acres) of land with established shade trees and evergreen gardens, two sports fields, two basketball courts, and a swimming pool complex comprising an 18-meter pool, 25-meter pool, and an infant splash pool. The BMIS Primary School has 21 teacher-based classrooms and specialized rooms for art, music, reading/ICT and educational support. In the Secondary School, facilities include 21 specialist teacher classrooms, four science laboratories plus a dedicated data-logging lab, and three Technology rooms.United States Department of State Art and music have specialist rooms and a new drama studio is under construction. The school library has over 22,000 literary and reference works, with three distinct sections for secondary and primary students. An assembly hall with a stage is also used as a theatre and further doubles as a sports hall for badminton, volleyball and gymnastics. The school employs a full-time nurse who is available during the school day. The clinic has three beds that may be used while waiting for a parent to collect a sick child. Medication may be left with the nurse to administer to children if required. The US Embassy Medical Centre regularly runs first aid training with teachers and staff at the school. The embassy also provided a portable defibrillator unit for emergency standby.  Technology  The school has a fiber-optic network and campus-wide wireless coverage that facilitates connectivity for over 200 computers. The school also provides over 100 iPads for classroom research and encourages students to bring the own devices to connect to the network and Internet. In 2014, security CCTV cameras were introduced into the key thoroughfares and gates around the school and a central PA system was installed.  New constructions  The school has recently completed building a new hall as well as a new block of changing rooms.  School magazines  Chikumbutso, Tikambe and Mawa are the official school publications. Both students and staff contribute the content of these three magazines. * Mawa is published on a weekly basis and provides the parent community with a summary of the forthcoming events. * Tikambe is published monthly and features news and articles about the events and activities that have taken place in the school. * Chikumbutso is the school yearbook, which is published at the end of each academic year.

Crash The crash happened at around 07:30 on the morning of Friday, 23 October 2015 at a bend on Departmental Road 17 not far south of Puisseguin. Authorities said they believed the lorry, carrying logs, lost control on a bend and jackknifed into the coach's path. That is a Head-on collision. Both vehicles burst into flames as a result of the collision. The cause of the fire and consequent loss of life was that the truck had installed on a large aluminum gasoline tank carrying fuel for chainsaws and other logging equipment which ruptured in the crash. Afterwards, gasoline streamed down the hill under the bus, where accident sparks ignited it, and the fire traveled back to the truck. The bus was equipped with emergency escape hammers with which to break windows, but passengers were not aware of them or not instructed in their use, and several passengers had mobility issues. Casualties Forty-one of the dead were on the bus, with the other two being the driver of the lorry and his three-year-old son. Most of the dead on the bus were elderly people who had just set off from the nearby town of Petit-Palais-et-Cornemps, and belonged to that town's seniors' club.  Rules  According to the BEA-TT, the different applicable rules/standards for road vehicles such as autocar, to address fire concerns, are defined at different scales, to let those vehicles work and operate in various countries: United Nations, European Union, and France.

In 2005 four branches of the company were merged into one company Beaulieu International Group, which is still the largest West European carpet group. The only branches that were kept out were Domo (because Jan had fallen into dishonor with his father) and Beaulieu in America (which Mieke preferred to keep independent). At this point none of the De Clercks was part of the daily management and in October 2005 De Clerck himself also stepped down. Scandals In 1987 Roger De Clerck had his first run-in with the law. He was suspected of having exported large fortune from his companies to foreign counties under the veil of commission fees. A money export of about 1,5 to 2 billion Belgian francs were traced. He was found guilty, but his punishment was dismissed because his social position and the employment of his personnel could become endangered. In 1989 five business employees, including his sons Jan and Dominiek, spent a week in jail in England, because they had sold their carpets in black market money. Couriers smuggled the money in their clothing and luggage to Belgium. Two years later De Clerck bought his sons off with 2 million euro, without any prosecution or conviction coming about. In 1997 Jan De Clerck and his partner Martine Van De Weghe were arrested. An associate of Jan, Ronny Verhoeven - who was a banker at Generale Bank in Sint-Niklaas - had whitewashed black market money through fake commission fees and bills. Verhoeven admitted this fraud in September 1997. In April 1998 Jan De Clerck was forced to do the same. Him and his wife admitted the fraud and paid 2,5 million euro. A year later they paid another 50 million euro to pay off their overdue personnel taxes and venture taxes. This caused a drift between them and the rest of the family, who kept repeating they were innocent. Roger De Clerck himself was suspected from forgery of documents, gang organisation and violation of the laws for venture taxes. He was also thought to have tried to bribe investigation judges and researchers. The Beaulieu group was thought to have had paid fake commission payments to a Libanese business family for years. They officially acted as middle man for the sales in the Middle-East and Russia, but according to the researchers they were simply straw men. Their commission payments on sold products were meant to scoop off the profits of the Beaulieu branches and were returned to the family in the shape of loans, investments or black market money. The case kept going for years. In April 2014 it was revealed that a new research was started to clear out suspicions of whitewashing in a Luxembourgian venture. Business shares which belonged to a Libanese businessman were carried over to the De Clerck family. Reputation Despite his massive wealth and large company imperium De Clerck was often nicknamed \\"Boer Clerck\\" (\\"Farmer Clerck\\") in the media, because of his roots in the farming industry, his local dialect and his simple-minded behavior. He detested this nickname himself. In 1999 De Clerck celebrated his 75th birthday. This event attracted a lot of press attention when he invited world-famous politicians to meet him at his garden party, including Margaret Thatcher and George H.W. Bush. Mikhail Gorbachev was invited too, but had to excuse himself because his wife, Raisa Gorbachev, was seriously ill. She would die that same year. De Clerck's son Jan was not invited because he had fallen into disgrace. Death De Clerck died in 2015 at the age of 91.

He is famous for his pyo poetry and he is one of the greatest poets of pre-colonial Burma, in particular his masterpieces, Paramidawkhan Pyo () and Sodaungkhan Pyo (), which are considered ideal models of the medieval literary style. While the primary focus of MahƒÅsƒ´lava·πÉsa's compositions was dhamma (Buddhist teachings), he also composed the earliest extant Burmese chronicle, Yazawingyaw. His contemporary literati rival was Shin Ra·π≠·π≠hasƒÅra. Personal life The remains of Shin Mahasilavamsa are housed at a reliquary tomb near the Hsinmyashin Pagoda in Sagaing. MahƒÅsƒ´lava·πÉsa was born Maung Nyo in Myolulin village (north of Taungdwingyi on a Friday in 1453, to U Kyi and Daw Dwe. He studied Buddhist scriptures and literature at the Yadana Beikman Monastery under the tutelage of the Natmilin Sayadaw (Shin Sƒ´lƒÅcƒÅrabhidhaja). While it is not known when he became a novice monk, his gift for poetry was recognized from the age of 7. When he was 20, he became a monk under Shin Sƒ´lƒÅcƒÅrabhidhaja. At the age of 38, he wrote his masterpiece, Paramitawkhan Pyo, which garnered recognition from throughout the kingdom. At the age of 40, he moved to Ava; KingMinkhaung II of Ava subsequently donated the YadanaBeikman Golden Monastery at Sagaing as his residence. Works Paramidawkhan Pyo is one of the greatest compositions of Burmese literature. Throughout this literary career, he composed numerous epics, stone inscriptions, and poetic verses including: # Record of the Golden Palace Title (·Äõ·ÄΩ·Äæ·Ä±·Äî·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äò·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äô·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·ÄÄ·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏) # Htupayon Pagoda stone inscription (·Äë·Ä∞·Äï·Ä´·Äõ·ÄØ·Ä∂·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÖ·Ä¨) # Yadana Beikman Monastery stone inscription (·Äõ·Äê·Äî·Ä¨·Äó·Ä≠·Äô·Ä¨·Äî·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÖ·Ä¨) # MitthilƒÅ Lake (Shisha Lake) songs (·Äû·Äª·Äæ·Ä≠·Äû·Äª·Äæ·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÄ·Äî·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫ (·Äô·Ä≠·Äê·Äπ·Äë·Ä≠·Äú·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Äî·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫) ·Äò·ÄΩ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏) # PƒÅramƒ´dawkhan Pyo (·Äï·Ä´·Äõ·Äô·ÄÆ·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑) # Sutaungkhan Pyo (·ÄÜ·ÄØ·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑) # Nanphwin Linka (·Äî·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äñ·ÄΩ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äú·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÄ·Ä¨) # Buddhuppatti Pyo (·Äó·ÄØ·Äí·Äπ·Äì·ÄØ·Äï·Äπ·Äï·Äê·Äπ·Äê·Ä≠·Äï·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑) # RƒÅjavasatƒ´khan Linka (·Äõ·Ä¨·Äá·Äù·Äû·Äê·ÄÆ·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äú·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÄ·Ä¨) # Record of the Inaugural Memorandum (·Äê·Äî·Ä∫·Äê·Ä¨·Ä∏·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äê·Ää·Ä∫·Äô·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·ÄÄ·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏) # Taungdwinla Pyo (·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äê·ÄΩ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äú·Ä¨·Äï·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑) # Sa·πÉvegakhan Pyo (·Äû·Ä∂·Äù·Ä±·ÄÇ·ÄÅ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑) # DhammapƒÅla Pyo (·Äì·Äô·Äπ·Äô·Äï·Ä´·Äú·Äï·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑) # PƒÅrƒÅyanavatthu (·Äï·Ä´·Äõ·Ä¨·Äö·Äî·Äù·Äê·Äπ·Äë·ÄØ) # Yazawingyaw (·Äõ·Ä¨·Äá·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫) # MahƒÅrahanƒ´ti (·Äô·Äü·Ä¨·Äõ·Äü·Äî·ÄÆ·Äê·Ä≠) # Hsonmasa Linka (·ÄÜ·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äô·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Äú·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÄ·Ä¨) # Treatise on BuddhƒÅla·πÖkƒÅra (·Äó·ÄØ·Äí·Äπ·Äì·Ä´·Äú·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÄ·Ä¨·Äõ·ÄÄ·Äª·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏) # NettipƒÅ·∏∑idaw (·Äî·Ä±·Äê·Äπ·Äê·Ä≠·Äï·Ä´·Ä†·Ä≠·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫) # NettihƒÅra Akauk (·Äî·Ä±·Äê·Äπ·Äê·Ä≠·Äü·Ä¨·Äõ·Ä°·ÄÄ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫)  References  Category:Theravada Buddhist monks Category:Burmese Theravada Buddhists Category:Burmese Buddhist monks Category:Burmese Buddhist scholars Category:Buddhist writers Category:Theravada Buddhism writers Category:1453 births Category:1518 deaths Category:Burmese male poets ","title":"Shin Mahasilavamsa"},{"id":"48334270","text":"BT Business and Public Sector is a retail division of United Kingdom telecommunications company BT Group that provides fixed-line, mobile, broadband and IT services to businesses (predominantly small and medium-sized enterprises) and the public sector in the UK and Ireland.

Examples of other circumstances which can cause large deviations from a volume forecast are weather (e.g. temperature-changes for gas consumption), the plant-availability, the collective customer outrage, but also regulatory interventions. Another relevant cause of volatility risk in volumes and (or) prices of commodities is the financial investment in options or future contracts related to a commodity, which is achieved with the purpose of speculating, rather than hedging in order to reduce the risk of adverse price movements in assets.

He is best known as the creator of difficult Super Mario World ROM hacks and Super Mario Maker levels. His notable work includes Super Mario World ROM hack Super Dram World and Super Mario Maker levels \\"P-Break\\" and the \\"Pit of Panga\\" series. He has also played through Super Mario World blindfolded. Personal life Tan is from Rocky Hill, Connecticut, and is a graduate of Rocky Hill High School, where he holds the school records for the 800-meter and 1,000-meter run. His fastest mile run is 4:23.13. In 2018, he graduated from the University of Connecticut School of Business with a degree in management information systems, and was an NCAA Division I cross country runner for the UConn Huskies during the 2014‚Äì2015 season. He plays the piano and trumpet and claims to have perfect pitch. Speedrunning career PangaeaPanga was the world record holder for speedrunning Super Mario World in 2015, having beaten the game in 1 minute and 38 seconds using arbitrary code execution, though this record has since been beaten. PangaeaPanga started playing Super Mario World while blindfolded on June 16, 2015, and completed a full run of the game this way eight days later. He has stated that he got the idea from gamer DavisKongCountry, who played portions of the game blindfolded. To beat the game in this way, PangaeaPanga memorized a route that was \\"easy and consistent\\", using musical cues from the game to know when to carry out certain actions. The run took 23 minutes, despite playing as the character Mario, dying a few times, and getting lost. After having his world record beaten on July 20, 2016, in a time of 17:46, he reclaimed the title a few days later on August 8, 2016 with a time of 15:59 using the Japanese release, before once again having his world record beaten on May 24, 2017 with a time of 13:31. In September 2015, YouTube removed the majority of PangaeaPanga's tool-assisted speedrun videos from his channel after a Digital Millennium Copyright Act claim was made by Nintendo. PangaeaPanga described his YouTube channel as \\"wrecked\\" on Twitter and stated that he finds it a \\"shame\\" that content creators \\"are restricted to ‚Ä¶ Super Mario Maker instead of the way we have always done.\\" Super Mario levels =ROM hacks= A segment of PangaeaPanga's Item Abuse 3, depicting the game's difficult platforming challenges. The game has been cited as the most challenging Super Mario World ROM hack. Through ROM hacking, PangaeaPanga has made several difficult levels for Super Mario World, the most famous of which is \\"Item Abuse 3\\". This level, which took three years to create and beat, has been described as \\"the hardest Super Mario World level ever\\". The level is impossible to beat without making use of tool-assistance to allow individual frame button input. PangaeaPanga has declared that \\"Anyone who can complete this is pretty much mentally insane.\\" In addition to the Item Abuse series, PangeaPanga has also created three additional hacks inspired by the Kaizo Mario World series titled Super Dram World, Super Dram World 2, and Super Foss World, of which the former two have been speedrun live at a Games Done Quick event. =Super Mario Maker= In September 2015, 10 days after the American release of Super Mario Maker, PangaeaPanga uploaded \\"Pit of Panga: P-Break\\". The level, which took five hours to create, had to be beaten beforehand to be uploaded to Super Mario Maker servers, as the game prevents players from uploading impossible levels. PangaeaPanga beat the level in nine hours, all of which he streamed on Twitch. \\"P-Break\\" was a sequel to \\"Bomb Voyage\\", another difficult level PangaeaPanga created. It took the Super Mario Maker community a collective total of 11,000 tries before speedrunner Bananasaurus Rex beat this level. By the end of October 2015, \\"P-Break\\" was beaten 41 times. After stating that \\"in an ideal world, no more than ten clears would satisfy me\\", PangaeaPanga went on to create the even more difficult \\"Pit of Panga: U-Break\\", which was later awarded the world record for the \\"Most difficult level created in Super Mario Maker\\" by Guinness World Records. PangaeaPanga influenced several other people to create unusually difficult Super Mario Maker levels. In an interview, PangaeaPanga has stated that he never really tried to build easy levels, as he enjoys to \\"force players to take a single specific route\\", in contrast to the autonomy video games usually offer players. Furthermore, PangaeaPanga has noted that he aims to make levels \\"both fair and fun, without being too aggravating or difficult\\", which he achieves by playtesting his levels extensively. Another level of his creation, \\"Cyber Security 101: Brute Force\\", required players to enter two random eight-digit numbers, giving a player a 1 in 10 quadrillion chance of winning on a random attempt.

It is a rhizomatous perennial, from Kashmir, India. It has straight, sword-shaped, glaucous leaves, tall, thick stem with up 2 short branches, which hold 2‚Äì3 flowers, which can be white, cream or pale blue, lilac, lavender or blue-purple. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant in temperate regions, although in Kashmir, it is also planted on graves. Description It has thick and stout rhizome,British Iris Society (1997) which is fibrous, and creeps along the ground. It has ensiform (sword-like), yellowish-green, or glaucous (blue-green), straight, leaves. They have scarious (paper-like) margins, and ribs. The herbaceous leaves, can grow up to between long, and between wide. It has an oval (in cross-section), thick stem or peduncle,Kelly Norris that can grow up to between tall. Occasionally, it can reach up to tall. It has 1‚Äì2 short, 1 cm long, branches (or pedicels). The branching habit distinguishes it from Iris albicans (another white flowering tall bearded iris), which does not have branches. The stem has long, green, spathes (leaves of the flower bud), They are long. They appear from the middle of the stem, up towards the flowers, and they have a narrow scarious margin, The stems (and the branches) hold several clusters of flowers, normally between 2 and 3 flowers, early in the season, between April to June. Up to 4‚Äì6 flowers can be blooming at one time. It has a cylindrical, perianth tube, that is white, with blue markings and yellow-green veins, or green tube. The tube is long. The fragrant flowers, also come in various shades. The most common, are white,Umberto Quattrocchi or creamy white. Or white tinged with blue. Other forms found include pale blue, lilac, lavender or blue-purple, the purple forms may not hybrids. The white forms are very similar to Iris albicans. Like other irises, it has 2 pairs of petals, 3 large sepals (outer petals), known as the 'falls' and 3 inner, smaller petals (or tepals), known as the 'standards'. The falls are obovate, rounded or cuneate (wedge-shaped), long and wide. They often have blue markings, and yellow-green veining, especially on the hafts (section of petal near the stem). In the centre of the fall, is a dense, narrow, white beard of hairs, tipped with yellow. The standards are obovate, oblong or elliptic shaped, long and wide. They have a short yellowish haft, and sometimes have a sparse beard. It has style branch that is 5 cm long, with an entire stigma, and large and triangular crests. It has white, or cream, filaments, that are 1.3‚Äì2 cm long. It has 1.4 ‚Äì 1.7 cm long anthers, and cream pollen. It has a green ovary, that has ridges and grooves, and is 1 ‚Äì 1.2 cm long. After the iris has flowered, it rarely, produces a seed capsule, which is about long and 2.2 cm wide, with thick and woody capsule walls. Within the capsule, are wrinkled, globular, dark red- brown, or red-brown seeds. =Biochemistry= In 1956, a karyotype analysis was carried out on 40 species of Iris, belonging to the subgenera Eupogoniris and Pogoniris. It found that 24-chromosome tall bearded species could e divided into 3 karyotypes of Iris pallida. Iris kashmiriana has 2 pairs of median-constricted marker chromosomes, Iris illyrica, Iris cengialti, and Iris imbricata, lastly Iris variegata, Iris reginae(now classified as a synonym of Iris variegata), and Iris perrieri all have no median-constricted chromosomes. In 1990, 'Iriskashmirianin' flavonoid was found in Iris kashmiriana by Kacheroo.J.B. Harborne In 1996, a study was carried out on the rhizomes of Iris kashmiriana, two new isoflavones, 'isocladrastin' and 'kashmigenin', were found. In 1998, a study was carried out on flower senescence (aging) in Iris kashmiriana. In 2008, a chemical study was carried out on the rhizomes of Iris kashmiriana led to the isolation of three isoflavones characterized as (4'-hydroxy-8-methoxy-6,7-methylenedioxyisoflavone) 'isonigricin', (5,6-dihydroxy-4',7-dimethoxyisoflavone) 'isoirisolidone', and (5,7-dihydroxy-4',6-dimethoxyisoflavone) 'irisolidone'. In June 2012, a phytochemical study was carried out on 5 iris species growing in Kashmir, India. Including Iris crocea, Iris ensata, Iris germanica, Iris hookeriana and Iris kashmiriana. It found several flavonoids (including isoflavonoids, glycosides and tannins), within the irises. In December 2012, an evaluation study was carried out on the isoflavones ('isonigricin' and 'isoirisolidone'), isolated from the rhizomes of Iris kashmiriana, when used on T-lymphocytes and T-cell cytokines. In July 2013, a study was carried out of the use of methanolic extracts from the rhizomes of Iris kashmiriana to be used on epithelial cancerous tumors and other inflammatory diseases. As most irises are diploid, having two sets of chromosomes, this can be used to identify hybrids and classification of groupings. Iris kashmiriana is a tetraploid, and has a chromosome count of 2n=24, 44, 48.Dan H. Meckenstock Taxonomy Painted illustration of Iris kashmiriana Baker (called Iris bartonii Foster, later recognised as a synonym) for Curtis‚Äôs Botanical Magazine, vol. 112 t6869 (in 1886) by Matilda Smith It has the common name of 'Kashmir Iris'.Ruskin Bond In India and Kashmir, it is known as 'Mazamond', 'Mazarmund', or 'safed mazarmond‚Äô. Which is derived from 'Mazar' meaning graveyard, or cemetery, and 'Mond' meaning root or underground swollen portion, the rhizome. Although, one source, declares that Iris nepalensis is known locally as 'mazarmund'.Maharaj Krishnen Kaul The Latin specific epithet kashmiriana refers to coming from Kashmir.D. Gledhill Sue Gordon (Editor) Julia Brittain This is a feminine version of the name, compared to Delphinium kashmirianum (masculine form) and Tragopogon kashmirianus, the gender neutral form.Gurcharan Singh It was brought to the UK by missionaries to Sir Michael Foster. It was introduced to Kew Gardens by Dr. Aitchison in about 1875. It was first published and described by John Gilbert Baker in Gardeners' Chronicle (Gard. Chron.) Series.2, page 744, in 1877. It was also published by Foster, Gard. Chron. 1883 (1): 275 1883, Hook. f., Fl. Brit. Ind. 6: 275. 1892; Baker, Handb. Irideae (Handbook of the Irideae): 38. 1892; Wendelbo & Mathew in Rech. f., Fl.

William Rickatson Dykes later re- classified Iris bartoni, which Mr Foster had received from Col. Newton Barton (a Major in the Honourable Artillery Company,) who found it in Kandahar, as a synonym of Iris kashmiriana. Iris kashmiriana was verified by United States Department of Agriculture and the Agricultural Research Service on 4 April 2003, then updated on 1 December 2004. It is listed in the Encyclopedia of Life. and is an accepted name by the RHS, and last listed in the 'RHS Plant Finder' in 2012. Distribution and habitat It is native to tropical Asia. =Range= It is found in India, (within Kashmir, and Jammu,) Nepal, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, (or Baluchistan,). It is thought to be the most easterly species in the subgenus of Iris section. It was introduced to Iran. It is listed as an endemic ornamental garden plant with Iris hookeriana and Iris duthiei (a synonym of Iris kemaonensis) in Kashmir. =Habitat= It grows close to settlements. It can be found at an altitude of above sea level and also at 2500 ft to 9500 ft. Cultivation It is not hardy in western Europe, and US. It is difficult to keep growing in the UK, due to the fact that the rhizomes do not get high temperatures during the summer, also it does not like damp winters. It does have the reputation of wasting away after a good blooming period. It is not in general cultivation, and is less common than other species in the section, but it has established well in some gardens. It prefers to grow in well-drained and rich soils. It does not like shade. It can be grown in a rock garden. Dykes recommends a planting time of between August and September. In India, it grows in gardens, on the earth daubed roofs of houses, (similar to Iris tectorum in Japan). On 5 July 1889, specimens of the iris were collected from near to the town of 'Erzinghan', in Turkey, for the Museum Natural History, Paris. Specimens can be found at Kashmir University Botanic Garden (KUBG). In flower arrangements, the average vase life of stems and flowers stored under dry conditions at 5 ¬∞C was about 7 and 10 days in distilled water and sucrose, respectively, whereas the wet stored stems at 5 ¬∞C exhibited a vase life of about 8 and 11 days, respectively. =Propagation= Irises can generally be propagated by division, or by seed growing. =Hybrids and cultivars= It was used in the past in several breeding programmes, to create cultivars, due to the white flowers. Mr Foster found 3 forms of the plant, varying in colour from white to purple, and introduced 'Miss Wilmott' (Foster 1910) and 'Kashmir White' (Foster 1912). Mr Foster was uncertain of the parentage of the cross producing 'Kashmir White' and 'Miss Wilmott', but he thought that Iris kashmiriana was a parent. Later, Geddes Douglas in AIS Bulletin #87, p. 40‚Äì44 believed that 'Miss Wilmott' came not from Iris kashmiriana but from a cross of Iris cypriana and Iris pallida 'Dalmatica'. Later, chromosomal counts proved that Iris kashmiriana' was not the parent plant, as it has a chromosomal count of 2n=12,44,48 and 'Kashmir white' has a count of 2n=50. But it is a tetraploid parent to many other modern bearded irises. Iris kashmiriana cultivars include; 'Bartoni', 'Kashmiriana Purpurea' and 'Raniket'. Iris kashmiriana crosses include: 'Dalkish'. ¬º Iris kashmiriana crosses include; 'Angkhor Vat', 'Argentina', 'Azulado', 'Blanche', 'Emily Pyke', 'Kalif', 'Leopardi', 'Lucero', 'Marion Mohr', 'Metauro', 'Micheline Charraire', 'Mt. Kosciusko', 'My Own', 'Mystery', 'Nanook', 'Nerva', 'Ningal', 'Santa Fe', 'Snow Shadow', 'Sophronia', 'Venus De Milo', 'Western Skies' and 'Willoughbey'. Toxicity Like many other irises, most parts of the plant are poisonous (rhizome and leaves), and if mistakenly ingested can cause stomach pains and vomiting. Also, handling the plant may cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction.David G Spoerke and Susan C. Smolinske Uses Iris kashmiriana has been used as a medicinal plant in folk medicine. Normally, just the rhizome has been used, but the whole plant has also been used. The rhizome is peeled and dried, then it is grind into powder and can be mixed with oil to make a paste. The paste along with common salt is applied for rheumatism, or applied externally for joints pain, and is also applied on inflammatory skin disease and on wounds for desired results. In the Bandipora area, the dried rhizome was used to treat eczma and respiratory problems. It was also used to treat asthma, cancer, inflammation, liver and uterine diseases. It is medically important due to the pharmacologically active compounds (within the rhizome) including quinones, triterpenoids, flavonoids, isoflavonoids and stilbene glycosides. It can also treat animal ailments. A mixture of the rhizome powder, water and jaggery, or sugar, then formed into semi solid balls (and called 'Gullah'), they are given to cattle, as tonic against general body weakness. The plant can also be used to treat hepatic disorders and dropsy in cattle. The organic matter digestibilities and chemical composition of livestock fodder growing in the Kashmir valley, India have been tabulated. Other species used also include: Phragmites australis, Nymphoides peltata, Echinochloa crus-galli, Cyperus rotundus, Panicum antidotale and Iris kashmiriana. The rhizome was also used as a rodent repellent. Culture In Iran and Kashmir, the plant and Iris germanica, are most commonly grown on Muslim grave yards. References Sources * Mathew, B. 1981.

Mokihinui is on the Tasman Sea coastline north of Westport and is on the southern side of the M≈çkihinui River's mouth, the third largest river on the West Coast. Once known as Waimarie, its official name is currently Mokihinui (without a macron), although it is named after the M≈çkihinui River (officially spelled with a macron since 2019). Mokihinui is situated between the sea and the foothills of the Glasgow Range and State Highway 67 passes through Mokihinui just before reaching its northern end on the other side of the river. Statistics New Zealand includes Mokihinui in a statistical area of the same name that covers both the locality itself and its neighbours such as Seddonville and Summerlea. According to the 2013 New Zealand census, Mokihinui has a population of 186, an increase of 15 people since the 2006 census. Mokihinui's population increases during whitebait season, when visitors come to fish in the M≈çkihinui River's mouth.Tourism West Coast, \\"Mokihinui / Seddonville\\", accessed 24 June 2007. In the early 1890s, a branch line railway from Westport was opened to Mokihinui; it ultimately ran through to Seddonville and was known as the Seddonville Branch. Passengers were carried on mixed trains until trains became freight-only on 14 October 1946. The line continued to operate until the end of the 1970s, when the coal mining activity that provided almost the sole freight on the line declined to such a point that revenue was lower than maintenance costs. The railway closed north of Ngakawau on 3 May 1981 and traces of its formation can be seen in the countryside around Mokihinui.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, rev. ed.

Education and career Kupiainen completed his undergraduate education in 1976 at the Technical University of Helsinki and received his Ph.D. in 1979 from Princeton University under Thomas C. Spencer (and Barry Simon) with thesis Some rigorous results on the 1/n expansion. As a postdoc he spent the academic year 1979/80 at Harvard University and then did research at the University of Helsinki. He became a professor of mathematics in 1989 at Rutgers University and in 1991 at the University of Helsinki. In 1984/85 he was the Loeb Lecturer at Harvard. He was several times a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study.Kupiainen, Antti  Institute for Advanced Study He was a visiting professor at a number of institutions, including IHES, University of California, Santa Barbara, MSRI, √âcole normale sup√©rieure, and Institut Henri Poincar√©. He was twice an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians; his ICM talks were in 1990 at Kyoto on Renormalization group and random systems and in 2010 at Hyderabad on Origins of Diffusion. From 2012 to 2014 he was the president of the International Association of Mathematical Physics. From 1997 to 2010 he was on the editorial board of Communications in Mathematical Physics. In 2010 he received the Science Award of the city of Helsinki. He received an Advanced Grant from the European Research Council (ERC) for 2009‚Äì2014. Research Kupiainen works on constructive quantum field theory and statistical mechanics. In the 1980s he developed, with Krzysztof Gawedzki, a renormalization group method (RG) for mathematical analysis of field theories and phase transitions for spin systems on lattices. In addition in the 1980s he and Gawedzki did research on conformal field theories, in particular the WZW (Wess-Zumino-Witten) model. Then he was involved in applications of the RG method to other problems in probability theory, the theory of partial differential equations (for example, pattern formation, blow up, and moving fronts in asymptotic solutions of nonlinear parabolic differential equations), and dynamical systems (e.g. KAM theory). As an application of RG in probability theory, Kupiainen and Jean Bricmont showed that the random walk with asymmetric random transition probabilities in three or more spatial dimensions leads to diffusion (and therefore time-irreversible behavior). Kupiainen continued his investigations into the origins of diffusion and time- irreversibility in various model systems (such as coupled chaotic mappings and weakly coupled anharmonic oscillations).See Kupiainen's lecture at the ICM 2010 in Hyderabad. He also did research on the turbulent flow problem in hydrodynamic models. With Gawedzki, he established \\"anomalous inertial range scaling of the structure functions for a model of homogeneous, isotropic advection of a passive scalar by a random vector field.\\" (Kolmogorov's theory of homogeneous turbulence breaks down for a particular model.) In 1996 Kupianien and Bricmont applied high temperature methods from statistical mechanics to chaotic dynamical systems.

Under a VPA, the partner country agrees to export only legal timber products to the EU, while the EU agrees to give verified legal ('FLEGT-licensed) timber products automatic access to the EU market. VPAs are also intended to strengthen forest governance in timber-exporting countries by improving transparency, accountability and stakeholder participation. The core of each VPA is the description of a timber legality assurance system the partner country will implement to verify the legality of timber products and issue verified legal products with a FLEGT licence. As of June 2015, six countries were implementing VPAs they have ratified with the EU (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Ghana, Liberia Indonesia, Republic of the Congo) and nine more countries were negotiating Voluntary Partnership Agreements with the EU (C√¥te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, Guyana, Honduras, Laos, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam).Juppi, M. & Tagliaferri, M. 2015.

Annual report. EU FLEGT Facility: Highlights and insights from 2015.. Retrieved 21 April 2016 Perspectives Critics of the FLEGT Action Plan point out that no FLEGT- licensed timber has yet arrived in the EU and that some EU member states have not yet fully implemented the EU Timber Regulation. Supporters of the FLEGT Action Plan say the time taken to deliver FLEGT licences indicates the rigour and credibility of the process. For instance, Saskia Ozinga of the campaigning organisation FERN described the FLEGT Action Plan as \\"the EU's best-ever policy on tropical forests, since it's the first scheme of its kind to address the root causes of illegal logging\\", and gave evidence of improved governance in Ghana, Liberia and Vietnam. Anand Punja of the UK Timber Trade Federation said the Action Plan \\"has strongly help create a fairer and more partnership approach to sourcing than before. UK Importers are now much more likely to invest in their supply chains and work in partnership to help their suppliers, some of whom are smaller businesses, to put into place the right procedures and practices to ensure a better approach to forest and timber supply chain management.\\" Timber trade analyst Rupert Oliver said: \\"From what I've seen of FLEGT processes in Ghana, Liberia and Indonesia, they have succeeded in bringing groups together who for decades have been at loggerheads and including those who were excluded in the past. There is a strong sense of progress and direction which has often been lacking in other policy initiatives. More importantly they are succeeding in building consensus on key issues in the forest sector beyond what has actually been achieved in many industrialised nations.\\"  European Court of Auditors report  On 22 October 2015, the European Court of Auditors issued a report that was critical of the European Commission's management of the FLEGT Action Plan. The report included a detailed response and rebuttal from the European Commission.  Independent evaluation of the EU FLEGT Action Plan  In July 2014, the European Commission initiated an independent evaluation of the implementation of the EU FLEGT Action Plan. The evaluation team was formed by independent experts from the TEREA ‚Äì Terre Environnement Am√©nagement consultancy. The report of the independent evaluation, published on 4 May 2016, confirmed that the EU FLEGT Action Plan is a relevant and innovative response to the challenge of illegal logging and that the Action Plan had improved forest governance in all target countries.  Related initiatives  Since the EU adopted the FLEGT Action Plan, other markets have taken steps to prevent trade in illegal timber products.

He became a prominent spokesperson for the movement in its early days, being known for his oratorical abilities.

In animals, these neurons are referred to as C low-threshold mechanoreceptors (C-LTMRs). CT neurons belong to a group C nerve fibers; these are unmyelinated, and have slow conduction velocities. CT afferents were discovered by √Öke Vallbo using the technique of microneurography. = Structure and location = In humans, using microneurography, CT neurons have been found in the hairy skin. In animals, these neurons have been genetically labelled and visualized with their relative patterns of axonal endings in hairy skin and in the spinal cord. In the rodent hairy skin, out of the three, two hair follicle sub-types (awl/auchene, and zigzag) have been found to be innervated by C-LTMRs in combination with other LTMRs. In humans, new psychophysical data suggests that CT neurons may also be present in the glabrous skin, but it might be that they have different biochemical and structural characteristics to the ones found in the hairy skin. In animals, they have been found electrophysiologically in the glabrous skin of the rat hindpaw, supporting the evidence of their existence in glabrous skin. = Molecular markers = Since these CTs or C-LTMRs are non-peptidergic, immuno-labelling was a challenge. However, in combination with RNA-seq data and genetically modified mouse models, several labeling markers, i.e. VGLUT3, TAFA4, CaV3.2, CaV3.3 and GINIP have been discovered to visualize C-LTMRs using double staining methods in combination with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). = Role in pain = While these neurons are non-nociceptive and likely mediate low threshold innocuous mechanical sensations, in the context of background muscle pain using hypertonic saline they have been shown to mediate allodynia \\\\- pain due to a non-painful stimulus. Later, the role of CTs was also found in mediating allodynia in the model of a delayed onset muscle soreness, i.e. pain following eccentric exercise. Recently, several animal studies have shown the role of C-LTMRs in neuropathic pain behaviors, which suggests that both mechanical and cold allodynia, but not heat hyperalgesia, is mediated by them. = Pain modulation = In humans, their role in pain increase has been contested as, in some instances, they have been shown to reduce pain, depending on the context of the stimulus. This dual role is also confirmed by the markers found for C-LTMRs in animal models, i.e. some markers are glutaminergic and some are GABAergic in nature. = Role in pleasantness = In humans, these CTs have always been linked to pleasant touch behavior and are most responsive during slow gentle stroking of a brush with the velocity of 3 cm/s. CT neurons project to the insular cortex in the brain, and the firing frequency of CT neurons correlate with perceived pleasantness of skin stroking.

During World War II (1939‚Äì45) he helped reorganize the unions during the German occupation of France. He escaped arrest by the Gestapo, made his way to England, and represented the trade union movement in General de Gaulle's Free French government. After the war he was a deputy in the legislature from 1945 to 1958. He was Minister of Information from 1950 to 1951 and again for two weeks in 1958. He was Minister of Social Affairs from 1956 to 1957. As a minister he tried but failed to contain health costs, and contributed to the fiasco of the Suez Crisis. Early years (1908‚Äì28) Albert Gazier was born in Valenciennes, Nord, on 16 May 1908. His family adhered to Jansenism, and has been traced to a peasant family in 1814 in Taverny, to the north of Paris. His grandfather, Augustin Gazier (1844‚Äì1922) was a professor of literature at the Sorbonne who headed the Association of Friends of Port- Royal-des-Champs. His parents were F√©lix Gazier (1878‚Äì1916) and Victorine Louise Gonet (1885‚Äì1965). His father taught literature at the Lyc√©e de Valenciennes, and was co-editor of a major edition of the works of Pascal. He had one sister, born a year later. On the eve of World War I (1914‚Äì18) the family was transferred to Orl√©ans. Albert began his education at the Lyc√©e d'Orl√©ans, where his father taught. His father was mobilized at the start of the war and became an infantry captain. He died on 20 September 1916 at Bouchavesnes, in the Somme, when Albert Glazier was 8 years old. On 24 February 1920 Gazier became a Pupil of the Nation. His family moved to Paris, where Albert was admitted to the Lyc√©e Condorcet. He obtained a baccalaur√©at in philosophy and mathematics in 1925. After leaving school he contracted tuberculosis, and was bedridden for two years. Due to his illness his military service in the class of 1928 was waived, and the next year he was exempted from service. Sales clerk and union leader (1928‚Äì39) At the age of 20 Gazier obtained a job on 31 May 1928 with the bookstore of the Presses Universitaires de France in the Latin Quarter of Paris. He enrolled in the Faculty of Law of Paris, and studied in the evenings. He obtained his license as a lawyer in 1932. Gazier joined the General Confederation of Labour (Conf√©d√©ration g√©n√©rale du travail, CGT) in 1930. He created a section for book salespeople within the Union of Employees of the Paris Region (Chambre syndicale des Employ√©s de la r√©gion parisienne), a union affiliated with the Federation of Employees (F√©d√©ration des Employ√©s) headed by Oreste Capocci. Gazier joined the French Socialist Party (Section Fran√ßaise de l'Internationale Ouvri√®re, SFIO) in 1932 as an activist in the Bois-Colombes section. He was a socialist candidate in the Bois-Colombes municipal elections of 5‚Äì12 May 1935. He did not win, but did obtain the most votes of the Left, ahead of the communist candidate. In September 1935 Gazier was elected secretary-general of the Union of Employees of the Paris Region, while continuing to work as a bookseller. The union included employees of banks, credit unions, department stores, small shops and so on. Gazier officially left the book shop on 30 April 1936, and became a full-time union employee. He ran unsuccessfully in the legislative elections of April 1936. In June 1936, when the department store employees went on strike, the number of members of Gazier's Union of Employees of the Paris Region shot up from 5,000 to 90,000. Gazier's influence in the CGT grew correspondingly. From 1936 he helped with the CGT Higher Institute for Workers' Education, and wrote some pamphlets for this institute. He was associated with L√©on Jouhaux's group in the CGT and condemned the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Germany in August 1939. World War II (1939‚Äì45) At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 Gazier enlisted voluntarily, despite having been exempted from military service in 1928. He served for ten months, then was demobilized in July 1940 after the German victory. Gazier was reconfirmed as secretary general of the Union of Paris Region Employees on 6 October 1940. He opposed the policies of the Vichy government and of Ren√© Belin, the former secretary of the CGT who had become a minister. On 9 November 1940 the government dissolved the unions. Gazier was one of twelve union leaders who signed the manifesto of opposition to the occupation in the autumn on 1940. This became the basis for resistance by the unions. Gazier's union continued to try to support workers, prevent layoffs and obtain wage increases. However, it was not allowed to distribute leaflets or publish newspapers, and the collaborationist press gave it little attention. In September 1942 Gazier refused to sit on the high council of the industrial economy. He was one of the founders of the Lib√©ration-Nord movement of the French Resistance. Gazier's union became one of the main sources of false identity cards in Paris. Gazier was named one of the seven secretaries of the clandestine CGT. This was confirmed after the trade union reunification in April 1943. In 1942 Gazier escaped arrest by the Gestapo, and in 1943 went into hiding. He was appointed CGT delegate to Free France, and on 19 October 1943 flew to London. For this secret journey he went via Lyon to Lons-le-Saunier in the Jura, getting off one station before his destination. He waited in a cow shelter near the village of Villevieux until the British airplane landed in a small field guarded by Resistance members, then flew to England with twelve other passengers. Gazier went on from London to Algiers, where he represented the CGT in the Provisional Consultative Assembly convened by General Charles de Gaulle. The CGT and Christian democratic union delegates helped defuse tensions between resisters and politicians in the Assembly. Glazier observed that, \\"For the first time in the history of the labor movement trade unionists took part in their own right in a political assembly.\\" After the liberation Gazier returned to France on 4 September 1944 and was confirmed as a secretary of the CGT. He was part of the team that published the journal R√©sistance Ouvri√®re from 24 November 1944. In January 1945 Gazier was with the CGT delegation that went to Moscow with Beno√Æt Frachon. He accompanied Frachon to the world congress of workers' unions in London, and was appointed to the executive committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions. At the London conference in February 1945 he argued unsuccessfully for separation of political and union offices on the basis that they were incompatible. At the confederal congress of the CGT from 27‚Äì30 March 1945 he was named a secretary of the CGT. Deputy (1945‚Äì58) Gazier was elected to the first National Constituent Assembly from 21 October 1945 to 10 June 1946 as deputy for the Seine department. After his election he ceased his union activities. On 3 November 1945 he married Marie-Louise Elter, a 35-year-old widow and teacher whom he had met in Algiers. Gazier was opposed to both the communists and the Gaullists. He was under-secretary of state for the national economy and finance from 26 January 1946 to 24 June 1946 in the cabinet of F√©lix Gouin. He was reelected to the second National Constituent Assembly from 2 June 1946 to 27 November 1946. He was under-secretary of state for public works and transport from 24 June 1946 to 16 December 1946 in the cabinet of Georges Bidault. He was elected to the legislature on 10 November 1946. He was secretary of state for the presidency of the provisional government of L√©on Blum from 16 December 1946 to 22 January 1947. Gazier was a member of the executive committee of the SFIO from 1947 to 1969. He was Minister of Information from 12 July 1950 to 11 August 1951 in the cabinets of Ren√© Pleven and Henri Queuille. As Minister of Information he helped improve the equipment of Radiodiffusion fran√ßaise, and introduced advertising programs. He was reelected to the legislature on 17 June 1951. He argued for participation of the SFIO in the government of Pierre Mend√®s France in 1954, a minority position. During the Moroccan crisis of October 1955 Glazer spoke of the trend for colonies to move towards independence around the world. He did not think it was practical to give autonomy to Morocco and Tunisia while treating Algeria as an integral part of France. He felt the government had to work out how to give sovereignty to Algeria while being careful to protect the French population. He was again elected to the legislature on 2 January 1956. Gazier was Minister of Social Affairs from 1 February 1956 to 6 November 1957 in the cabinet of Guy Mollet and the subsequent cabinet of Maurice Bourg√®s-Maunoury. He drew up a proposal to limit increases in doctors' fees to the rate of inflation. The ministry would define the fees, which would be indexed to the cost of living and the minimum wage. A maximum of 15% of doctors would be allowed to charge more, under legally-defined conditions. Patients of the doctors who charged above the maximum could not apply for reimbursement by social security. When the number of doctors charging excess fees had risen to 15%, social security funds would be allowed to establish their own health centers, or to make arrangements with doctors to provide services. The proposal caused a public outcry and attacks against Gazier. Rural doctors accepted the Gazier proposal, but the richer urban doctors opposed it. The proposal was adopted by the cabinet on 30 January 1957. The medical association escalated its campaign against the proposal in the press and in parliament. The proposal was dropped after the Mollet cabinet fell in May 1957. During the Suez Crisis, in October 1956 Gazier was in charge of the Quai d'Orsay while Christian Pineau, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, was in New York. He was concerned that the Israelis would respond to the presence of Iraqi troops in Jordan by occupying the West Bank. On 14 October 1936 he flew to London with General Maurice Challe to meet Prime Minister Anthony Eden. He pointed out that while Britain was obliged by treaty to support Jordan, France would have to support Israel, putting them on opposite sides. Eden told Gazier and Challe he would ask the Iraqis to hold back from moving troops to Jordan. Gazier pressed Eden on how he would react to an Israeli attack on Egypt, and Eden said he would not support the Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser if that happened. They discussed the possibility of encouraging the Israelis to attack Egypt and quickly occupy the Sinai Peninsula, at which point France and Britain would send in a police force \\"to separate the combatants\\" which would occupy the whole length of the canal. Eden's acceptance of this plan led to the fall of his government and the end of British authority in the Middle East. Gazier was Minister of Information from 17 May 1958 to 1 June 1958 in the short-lived government of Pierre Pflimlin. Although close to Guy Mollet, Gazier would not join him in supporting de Gaulle. In the National Assembly in June 1958 and in the constitutional referendum in September 1958 he voted against de Gaulle's new constitution. He had broken completely with the leadership of the SFIO. He lost his seat in the October 1958 elections. His mandate as deputy ended on 8 December 1958 at the end of the French Fourth Republic. Later career (1959‚Äì97) After leaving the chamber Gazier joined a socialist advisory group as head of its department of Third World cooperation. In 1962 the National Center of Socialist Studies (Centre national d'√©tudes socialistes) published a study by Gazier on cooperation and aid to under- developed countries. The analysis covered the reasons for under-development, the different problems that these countries experienced, and finally the different solutions that he considered feasible. At that time there were 3 billion inhabitants of the planet, of whom 2 billion lived in misery. He noted that in the French African colonies many goods were sold at much higher prices than were charged in metropolitan France, typically at 50% more. In these countries the life expectancy was 30 to 35 years, compared to 67 years in France. The birth rate was extremely high, and the consequences were Malthusian. He criticized the encouragement of monoculture farming and lack of investment in industrial development. He said it was certain that the prophecies of Karl Marx would come true if socialist and unionist actions did not put an end to the absolute poverty of the workers. In the 1960s Gazier, Christian Pineau and Gerard Jacquet formed a minority in the SFIO hostile to the new powers. He supported the appointment of Fran√ßois Mitterrand to the leadership of the Socialist Party in June 1971. He sat on the steering committee and the executive board until 1972, then led the \\"group of experts\\". In 1981 Gazier accepted a position as an adviser to Pierre Mauroy. In 1983 Fran√ßois Mitterrand appointed him to the High Council of the Judiciary (Conseil sup√©rieur de la magistrature). Albert Gazier died on 2 March 1997 in Vanves, Hauts-de-Seine.

It was directed by Mark Meily, Andoy Ranay and Chris Martinez starring Cristine Reyes, Maricel Soriano, Herbert Bautista, Antoinette Taus, Paolo Ballesteros, Jason Gainza, Candy Pangilinan, Benjie Paras and Shy Carlos. It was released on January 13, 2016. The film parodies mainstream Filipino movies and television shows, as well as popular culture, while tackling several national issues at the same time. Synopsis =Bala Sa Bala, Kamao Sa Kamao, Satsat Sa Satsat= The first film in the trilogy centers around Diego, an action star who wants to take revenge against a group of bad guys, also known as \\"Bandidos\\" (bandits), after they killed his parents, his wife, Ashley, and everyone who attended their wedding, just a few moments right after they get married at the beginning of the film. As the story unfolds, Diego, being an action star, gets into misadventures and finds himself in trouble-after-trouble. Unfortunately, Divina Tuazon, a famous actress and Diego's new found leading lady, was kidnapped by the Bandidos. Finally, in an abandoned warehouse (a setting where most of Pinoy action films' final scenes takes place), Diego tries to save Divina from the evil hands of Bandido's merciless and heartless leader named \\"Bos\\". The plot generally follows themes from classic Filipino action movies, as well as comedy films from early 80's to 90's. For example, Diego's sidekicks, Dodoy and Momoy uses slapstick from time to time, a type of comedy which was very popular in the country for the past decades. =Shake, Shaker, Shakest= A middle-class family was forced to enter and stay in a white haunted house for several days after being stranded in an unfamiliar place. The title is play on the Shake, Rattle & Roll film series and the plot is a ludicrous horror film. =Asawa ni Marie= A rags-to-riches story about Marie, a poor girl who has a confusing status in life and love. The plot is similar to Philippine dramas/ soap operas, particularly Marimar and brands from commercial.

Pendleton Memorial Library is the public library of Islesboro, Maine. It is located at 309 Main Road, in an architecturally distinguished Colonial Revival building built in 1917, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Previously known simply as the Islesboro Free Library, it was named in honor of Alice Pendleton, the town's first librarian and a major force in the library's establishment. Architecture and history The town of Islesboro occupies an eponymous island in Penobscot Bay, on the central Maine coast. The island is roughly shaped as two lobes joined by a narrow isthmus. The library is located on the east side of Main Road, just north of its junction with County Road, in the northern part of the southern lobe. It is a single-story masonry structure, built out of random ashlar granite with brick trim. The main facade, facing west, is symmetrical, with a center entrance sheltered by a Colonial Revival portico supported by groups of slender tapered Tuscan columns. The door, glassed in its upper half, is flanked by wide sidelights and topped by a low half-oval fanlight. The interior is arranged with a central circulating desk, reading rooms to either side, and book stacks in the basement and to the rear, where a cross-gabled section extends. The library was established in 1902 by a vote of the town meeting, and was at first housed on the second floor of a local school. The inadequacy of this space prompted a drive for the construction of a more suitable home, resulting in the construction in 1917-18 of this building. Its architect is now known, nor is it known if there was an original intent that it also serve as a war memorial. Plaques in the entry commemorate the town's war dead, and the flagpole and commemorative base that stand in front of the library were placed in 1921. Alice T. Pendleton was a professional librarian appointed the town's first librarian in 1902. She was active in building the town's collection, and in leading the effort to have a permanent home for it. Even after moving away from Islesboro in 1925, she continued to support the library, serving as assistant librarian during summer visits. The library was renamed in her honor in 1956.

Life Little is known of his life other than he began his career as an industrial chemist with Young‚Äôs Paraffin, Light and Mineral Oil Company in central Scotland. He was a Fellow of the Chemical Institute and a member of the Glasgow Philosophical Society.

Romantic musical theater, which flings the human into sublime state, affected the impressionable boy‚Äôs identity, defining the personality of the characters of his future works. Influenced by theateras a synthetic art form,Yuriy Yegorov combined different monumental techniques, such as painting, mosaics, and tapestries. In 1941, Yegorov‚Äôs family evacuated to Tashkent and then moved to Krasnoyarsk together with the Odessa Opera and Ballet Theater. In Krasnoyarsk, the future painter met Kyiv artists Stepan Kirichenko and Zinaida Volkovitskaya, who became his first teachers. They introduced the young man to the world of art and showed him albums of C√©zanne, Velazquez, and other painters. When he was 16, the amateur painter joined the Union of Artists of Krasnoyarsk city. Having returned to Odesa in 1946, YuriyYegorov was accepted to the 4th year of the painting department of Odesa Art College, where he studied in the studio of Professor Theophilus Fraerman. In 1948, he entered the Leningrad Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture named after Repin (USSR Academy of Arts). As a student of the 4th year, he moved to the faculty of monumental painting of the Art- Industrial College named after Mukhina(teachers: Johanson, Rublev, Savin). In 1955,Yegorov moved to Odesa to teach at the Grekov Odessa Art school until 1957. He was the rector of the Odesa Academy of Arts in 1995‚Äì1997. Since the beginning of the 1960s, a group of creative young people, later regarded as the Odesa non-conformist artists, gathered around Yegorov. In fact, Yegorov himself was not a non-conformist artist; however, he strongly helped and supported young artists who have chosen the path of confrontation with the system. It was Yegorov who first spoke about the Odesa school of painting and formed its basic tenets, thus becoming its most prominent representative and theorist. He participated in numerous domestic and foreign exhibitions of painting, graphics and monumental art. Since 1958, he was a member of the Union of Artists of the USSR. He was acknowledged as the Honored Artist of Ukrainian USSR in 1989 and the People's Artist of Ukraine in 2008. After the artist's death in June 2009, a permanent exhibition of his workswas opened at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Odesa.  Yegorov‚Äôs Sea  The sea is an integral part of the inner world of the artist. Yegorov writes about the sea in his memoirs: \\"... The three of us are standing on the edge of the cliff this summer morning; the giant shield of Sea sparkles with hot dazzling silver on the right and on the left, stretching away into endless distance. Somebody shrieked, and we started to descend one after another, leaning forward on a narrow path, to this immense, sparkling bliss... Many paintings began to slowly, invisiblyripen inside me when I, as a boy of ten, lived in the country of the Big Fountain. Lots of things existed back then as a possibility of which I myself had no idea. In some ways, this opportunity turned out to be a happy one, because something became real in the eternal drama between the possible, the supposed, and the real.\\" Yegorov‚Äôs creative method is characterized by multiple returns to the same motive. The artist does not focus on the search for a new narrative plot, but seeks the most expressive interpretation of the old subject. Hence, he often employs stable compositions coming from antique art and the Renaissance while creating his variations of eternal themes. Yegorov compared himself to a prospector who, having found a precious \\"lode\\", tries to develop it in full. When intuition and high artistic culture helped the painter feel he got close to a treasure, he developed these \\"lodes\\" for many years, advancing the found forms, postures, and positions of the figure in space. The essential difference of Yegorov‚Äôs painting technique from earlier marine art is his active use of close-ups, when the sea is depicted closely to the viewer. Previously, the sea was usually represented panoramically: the water was harmonically framed with catchy elements of the landscape, such as mountains, rocks, cliffs, and, on the other hand, the halls of high heaven. Sometimes human figures appear on the canvas, mostly as staffage. Anyway, a perspective view of the sea is usually depicted; the latter is an object we perceive with eyes from a distance (this is typical both for academic artists of the 19th century ‚Äì Aivazovskiy, Bogolyubov, Lagorio,Latri, Sudkovskiy and for the founders of Impressionism ‚Äì Manet, Monet, Sisley, Whistler, as well for Russian artists of the late 19th ‚Äì 20th century, such as Pokhitonov, Ladyzhenskiy, Nilus, Sinitskiy, Sheliuto, Malyshev, Morozov, Podobed, etc.). Yegorov, on the contrary, depicts the body of sea water close to the frame of the canvas. The sea often covers the most surface of the canvas. The artist, as a rule, paints it from a particular perspective ‚Äì a view from above which captures a small section of the coast and a very narrow strip of sky. Because of this approximation, which often resembles a cinematic close-up, we can immediately see and feel the texture of \\"flesh\\", \\"cloth\\", \\"stratification\\" of the water, as Arseniy Tarkovskiy poetically puts it. Due to such \\"close-ups\\", the sense of monumentality and the power of the sea become the fundamental and specific characteristic of the created image. Its integral part is a distinct feeling of the huge weight of water. It is generally a typical mood for a variety of Yegorov‚Äôs marinas, even those that are filled with lightness and ease, although the carefree and weightless atmosphere is not characteristic for the painter‚Äôs works. Contrasts, which become visible under the extremely bright and blinding light, as well as the game of light and shade, highlight the density of the deadly water mass. The fundamentally roundish lines of the skyline are also a typical feature of Yegorov‚Äôs marinas. Aivazovskiy, for example, used to wander along the coast line for many hours, enthusiastically observing the mysterious field of water, so attractive at the time of the vague sunrise or clear afternoon, at the beginning of twilight or during the sonorous, even solemn sunset. Yegorov‚Äôs works, however, reveal something different. It seems that he, unlike his contemplative predecessors, was actively in love with the sea. He seemed to dive into the water and interact with it like a playful dolphin, as if he perceived it not from above, but from the depths. This attitudecan be symbolically called the perspective of a diver. It is the perspective of a person who feels comfortable, safe, and natural in the water, at the same time overcoming its resistance, feeling its tension and buoyancy, as if in a duel. The deep-felt powerful beauty of the sea, perhaps forever imprinted in the emotional memory, is the basis of both unity and variety of the representations of the sea in Yegorov‚Äôs works. It is the colossal energy of marine space hidden under the sparkling and shiny surface as in Morning, 1967 (Odesa Art Museum). Girl with a Flag, 1971 (Red Square Gallery. London). We‚Äôre Departing Soon, 1973 (Tretyakov Gallery. Moscow), By the Sea, 1974 (Odesa Art Museum). At the same time, it is the stormy, dynamic, suddenly exposed life of the whirlpools, which accidentally appear on the surface of deep currents and which suck everything into the abyss ‚Äì as in Karolino-Bugaz, 1970 ( Red Square Gallery. London). It is also the cold breathtaking power of the majestic water field as in Lanzheron in November, 1979 (Odesa Art Museum), and, finally, the sapphire ultramarine shining of the sea in Evening in July, 1991 (M.

In 1914 she was in Copenhagen at the outbreak of the First World War and it was decided to leave her there for safety. However, pressure for tonnage required that she leave that port in 1916 under disguise and she crossed the North Sea to Hull, where she was renamed River Ribble. In 1922 she became the property of the London and North Western Railway and in 1923, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.

It was also capable of aerobatics. Only one was built but it was used from 1938 to the outbreak of war. Design and development The Delanne 60-E.1 was a single seat training glider suitable for those aiming for their D certificate. This required flights of over , out and return flights of more than 5 hours and flights with altitude gains of more than . It was a high wing aircraft. In plan the wings had three sections: two straight tapered outer panels with most of the sweep on the trailing edges and with semi-elliptical tips and an inner section, occupying about half the span, with an unswept leading edge and a curved trailing edge which decreased the central chord. It was mounted on the single upper longeron of the triangular section rear fuselage and braced to the central member of the lower forward fuselage with a single strut on each side to the wing at the junction of the wing panels. The Delanne's fuselage was in two parts, a deep, slightly rounded part, containing the cockpit under the wing leading edge, which occupied about half the overall length of the aircraft. It also had a distinct keel with a landing skid. The rear triangular section or boom overlapped the forward part, reaching the back of the cockpit and tapering to the rear. The leading edges of the swept, straight edged, round tipped tailplanes were fixed to the fuselage underside and were braced to it from above. They carried rounded elevators. The fin, likewise straight- edged, was mounted at the extreme end of the fuselage and extended below the elevators, though the hinge of the deep and very broad curved balanced rudder was far enough aft to require only a small elevator cut-out for movement. The bottom of the rudder was also below the boom but the latter's high position and a tailskid attached to the lower fin protected it from ground contact. Though the exact date of the Delanne 60-E.1's first flight is not known, it was certainly before 4 August 1938, when the aircraft attracted interest by making the first glider flight over Paris on its way from Coulommiers to Saint-Cyr. The pilot, Eric Nessler, achieved an altitude gain of during the flight. In August it went to La Banne d'Ordanche, from where it was flown by several pilots including Mme Jarlaud, the wife of its engineer. Nessler made a flight of 5 hours in it. The 60-E.1 was displayed at the 1938 Paris Aero Show (Salon), along with the gull winged, two seat Delanne 30, where it attracted international interest, particularly from Japan. In June 1939 the sole prototype was amongst gliders exhibited by the A√©roclub d'Enghien-Moisselles. It was used in its planned r√¥le as a D certificate trainer by the \\"L'Air\\" group. It was also capable of aerobatics as Robert Ivernel demonstrated in the summer of 1939 by winning an international competition at Saint-Germain in June and giving an exhibition at Boulogne-Billancourt in July.

Langloh Parker Australian Legendary Tales is a translated collection of stories told to K. Langloh Parker by Australian Aboriginal people. The book was immediately popular, being revised or reissued several times since its first publication in 1896, and noted as the first substantial representation of cultural works by colonised Australians. The 1953 edition for children received the Children's Book Council of Australia's Children's Book of the Year Award for Older Readers. First edition The first edition of Australian Legendary Tales: Folk-lore of the Noongahburrahs as Told to the Piccaninnies was published in 1896, being printed at London and Melbourne. The contents includes over 30 tales, with supplements that include a glossary and the first tale transliterated from the original language. The stories are set in a 'no-time' where animal spirits, supernatural beings and humans interact, often alluding to ideas of creation. Several references are made to an \\"All Father\\" Baiame, to a man Wurrunnah, a culture hero, and animal beings who engage with people and each other. Parker's prefatory remarks give acknowledgement to the \\"Noongahburrah\\" people and names some individuals who assisted her, the dedication is to man she describes as their king, Peter Hippi. The introduction by Andrew Lang also notes his inclusion of the illustrations, supplied by his brother at Corowa,A.W.P., 'Lang, W. H. (1859‚Äì1923)', Obituaries Australia, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, accessed 22 October 2015. by an \\"untaught Australian native\\"; the artist was later identified as Tommy McRae by the inscription on the original drawings amongst Lang's papers.Johnston, citing Muir, p.151 \\"Drawings made by a Black Fellow at Corowa, New South Wales, 1886. His name I do not know. By the whites he goes by the name Tommy Macrae\\" This edition was popular so the sequel, More Australian Legendary Tales (1898), was commissioned, once again with the imprimatur of Lang as supervising scholar. Following on from the publication of these two volumes was Parker's factual work, The Euahlayi Tribe (1905), also issued at Lang's behest, though Parker herself seems to regard Lang's authority with increasing scepticism, making an aside in her own prefatory remarks that seem to target the severe views in Lang's introductions.Johnston, citing The Euahlayi Tribe p.141 Some years later more of her collection of Aboriginal legends appeared in The Walkabouts of Wurrunnah (1918) and Woggheeguy (1930). Illustration by Tommy McRae for the tale \\"The Weeoombeens and the Piggiebillah\\". The book was prepared and marketed as part of a series overseen by Lang, similar to many other publications presented as scholarly works of folklore or fairy tales made English. These works often used the collections, made by English colonists and travellers, of spoken and written cultural materials appropriated from peoples of the British Empire and elsewhere.Johnston. Lang used this work to promulgate and reiterate his previously published ideas within the overlapping or merging fields of anthropology, ethnology, and philology, incorporating the work of a people he had never encountered or studied in support of a position that was no longer favoured. Many contemporary and favourable reviews in British periodicals approached the book as a work of Lang's folklore scholarship. His introduction compares some of the tales to a primitive Metamorphoses and the early animal stories of Kipling.Johnston, citing Lang, Australian Legendary Tales (1896) pp. xiii-xvi His opinion of McRae's drawings, \\"not ill-done\\" or worse, and the tales themselves is that they are the product of savage inferiors. Reviews and criticism Criticism of Parker's own practices start with her qualifying remarks in the preface, presenting the tales as one's heard by 'piccaninnies' and translated merely for the enjoyment of 'English children'. Most of the contemporary reviews focus on the authority of Lang,Johnston, who quotes Revue de l'Histoire des Religions: \\"spirituelle et alerte pr√©face de M. Andrew Lang.\\" though a review in Athenaeum praised the translation of Parker. A review in the Sydney Morning Herald agreed with Parker's belief that this was the first work in Australian literature to compile the legends of a particular group and exploit this as a folk-lore study. Later critics have reviewed the methods Parker outlined in her works more favourably; while they are practices that would later be regarded as unacceptable, they are at least as good or better than other collectors of the time. Parker had associated with Aboriginal Australians since her childhood on a station and continued to do so when she resided at a station near the Narran River in New South Wales. Later commentators noted Parker's familiarity and sympathy with the people, her thoroughness in collating word lists and translations make these Tales important in understanding the original tellers.Prefaces by H. Drake-Brockman and E. Durack in Australian Legendary Tales, 1953. In an 1897 review, published in The Bulletin, A. G. Stephens described her source material as being ethnologically insignificant and seemingly an invention by Parker, she responded in an undated letter that defends her methods of translation:Johnston, citing Stephens, A. G. \\"The Red Page.\\" Bulletin 17 (1897): n.p. [precedes p.1].; Parker, Letter to A. G. Stephens (undated). MS A.364. McCrae File. Mitchell Lib., State Library of New South Wales. (c. 1897). Parker invokes a folklore authority with two references to Max M√ºller in her preface, with whom Lang had a long running scientific feud, continued even in his obituary of that man. Her opinion of McRae's illustrations also describes the style as \\"rough\\", like Lang, although she stated that:\\"Artist Tommy McRae\\" at State Library of Victoria webpage citing Sayers, A. 1994, Aboriginal artists of the nineteenth century, Oxford University Press in association with the National Gallery of Australia, Melbourne, Vic. Illustration for Wirreenun the Rainmaker  1953 edition  Parker's collections of tales were again republished in Australia and Britain as Australian Legendary Tales (1953), selected and edited by Henrietta Drake- Brockman. This edition was appended with a study guide and bibliography, notes on editorial changes such as spelling, the deliberate omission of names from the sources and dedication, and other emendations. The illustrations were supplied by Elizabeth Durack, who also provides a context to her drawings execution in \\"the aboriginal manner\\". This edition was chosen by the Children's Book Council of Australia as \\"Book of the Year\\" for 1954. Drake- Brockman's preface refers to A. P. Elkin as an authority when supporting a claim that Parker \\"was in fact one of the first people to write exclusively of the Australian aborigines as fellow creatures\\" and,Johnston, citing Brockman, p.vi Vashti Farrer adapted some of these stories in Tales of the Dreamtime (1982),Oxford Companion to Australian Literature with illustrations by Walter Cunningham.Johnston, biblio., [1972 ed.?] Another selection from several of Parker's Tales was compiled as Wise Women of the Dreamtime: Aboriginal Tales of the Ancestral Powers (1993), with commentary by the editor, Johanna Lambert. As with the original edition, Lambert's recompilation included illustrations without attribution, except for the bark paintings of the artist Dorothy Djukulul.

Background The pair, one the wife of a dentist the other an officer of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (R.U.C.), died in what was then believed to be a suicide pact, although they were not lovers. The body of nurse Lesley Howell, 30, wearing Walkman earphones and clutching photos of her four children, lay on the back seat of a car. Constable Trevor Buchanan, 31, who was originally from near Omagh, lay dead in the front seat. The car was filled with exhaust fumes inside the garage of a house in the seaside town of Castlerock, County Londonderry, in Ulster in May 1991. An inquest heard that no crime was suspected, and returned verdicts of suicide. Howell's secret Eighteen years later, in 2009, Howell's husband Colin Howell, 50, a dental implant specialist, church-goer and born-again Christian, contacted police. Colin Howell was to reveal that the two were murdered by their respective spouses at the time: himself and Sunday school teacher Hazel Buchanan (later, Stewart) who were in fact, lovers. Their relationship continued secretly for five years after the murders, and both later remarried. Deric Henderson's 2011 book tells the story of dentist Howell and his lover with coverage of both trials and interviews of family members among others. A publication summary reads: > A series of disasters in Howell's life ‚Äì the death of his eldest son, > massive losses in an investment scam and the revelation that he has been > sexually assaulting female patients ‚Äì lead to him declaring that he is a > fraud and a godless man.

History Restored Harvard II in Royal Air Force desert camouflage colours at the Australian International Airshow, 2005. =1930s to 1940s= Boeing's relationship with the United Kingdom began in 1938 with the delivery of the North American T-6 Texan to the British Government. Known as the 'Harvard' outside the US, the aircraft was used for aerial reconnaissance and training from 1939 until its retirement in 1955. In June 1939, Pan American Airways (Pan Am) introduced its first transatlantic northern mail service, using a Boeing 314 that would deliver mail from New York to Southampton in the UK. That same month, Pan Am also announced that it was using another Boeing 314 for its first regular passenger air service. Boeing increased its cooperation with the British Government in 1941 by supplying three Boeing 314A aircraft which were allotted to The British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) for use as transport aircraft. Winston Churchill was the first world leader to make a transatlantic air trip aboard BOAC's Boeing 314 \\"Berwick\\" in 1942. The Eighth Air Force, formed in the US in 1941, was equipped with Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress' which participated in bombing raids on German targets in Europe while based in England. Boeing built 380 of the Douglas-designed A-20 Havoc, an aircraft that served under the Royal Air Force during World War II.Associated Press, \\"Last Havoc Bomber Produced by Douglas\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday 27 September 1944, Volume 51, page 7. =1980s to 1990s= British Airways Helicopters' Vertol 234LR G-BISP at Aberdeen Airport, 1985. After World War II, Boeing's business relationship with the UK did not begin again until the 1980s, with the exception of BOAC introducing the Boeing 707-436 to its aircraft line-up in 1960. The now defunct British Airways Helicopters bought six Vertol 234 Commercial Chinooks in 1981, providing services to offshore gas and oil platforms until the company was sold by British Airways in 1986. Rolls-Royce began testing and developing the RB211-534E4 turbofan engine in 1983 and was the engine used on the Boeing 757, generating over 40,000+ hours of on-wing life without removal. In 1988, Air United Kingdom became the first airline to operate the Boeing 737-400 outside of the US and later used the Boeing 767-300 ER series in 1993 for its subsidiary, Air UK Leisure. Eight Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bombers were deployed in the UK and participated in Operation Desert Storm in 1991. Later that year, Boeing Chinooks used by the Royal Air Force participated in a humanitarian aid effort to help Kurdish refugees in Turkey. =2000s to 2010= C-17 Transport aircraft of No. 99 Squadron at RAF Brize Norton enroute to a flypast over Buckingham Palace for the Queen's Birthday.

Flight International, 22 July 2004. Boeing received further orders from the MOD in 2006, 2007 and 2009. Boeing founded Boeing United Kingdom Limited as a legal entity in January 2002 and in April 2003 Boeing named Sir Michael Jenkins as the first president of Boeing UK. In 2004, Boeing began to expand its presence in the UK by announcing its ¬£7 million investment to build a new training centre at Crawley, West Sussex, close to London Gatwick. The move was to allow more convenient travel for those who required training in Europe, instead of travelling to Seattle, U.S. In September 2005, Sir Roger Bone succeeded Michael Jenkins as president of Boeing UK. Boeing opened its European Sales and Marketing Headquarters at Heathrow House, moving further operations from the U.S. to the UK. In 2007, Boeing opened its Defence Systems Engineering and Integration facility in Bristol and in 2009 integrated all UK defence programs under one entity by establishing Boeing Defence UK (BDUK). This enabled defence operations in the UK to be localised and more efficient. =2010 to present= Virgin Atlantic Boeing 787-900 London Heathrow, 2018. In September 2014, Roger Bone retired as president of Boeing UK and was succeeded by Michael Arthur. At the Farnborough Airshow in 2016, the UK government and Boeing announced a partnering initiative to advance growth and prosperity in the United Kingdom. The initiative required Boeing to increase overall bid opportunities offered to UK suppliers; make the UK its European base for training, maintenance, repair and overhaul across its defence fixed-wing and rotary platforms; and sign the Aerospace Growth Partnership Supply Chain Competitiveness Charter. In 2018, building on the partnering initiative, Boeing founded the Office of UK Industrial Capability (OUKIC). The OUKIC is an enterprise team composed of representatives from St. Louis and the UK that promotes UK innovation and supply chain competitiveness around the world. Based in Seattle, United States, the OUKIC helps British companies increase bid opportunities across defence and commercial aerospace. The OUKIC is supported by a Steering Committee of senior leaders from across the British Government and Boeing.

Boeing received planning permission to build a new hangar at London Gatwick in 2017. The investment of ¬£88 million, will be completed in 2019. Boeing UK opened its first European manufacturing site in 2018 in Sheffield, producing commercial aircraft components for its 737 and 767 line-up. HorizonX, Boeing's venture capital arm which invests in start-ups related to aerospace, made its first investment in the UK to Reaction Engines in April 2018, a hypersonic propulsion company developing a hybrid jet and rocket engine. In March 2019, Boeing's Horizon X invested $14 million in London-based start-up Isotropic Systems, alongside granting the company access to Boeing experts, test labs, and other resources. The company develops modular antenna systems for satellite communications and its user terminals use electronics instead of mechanical dishes to link with satellites, enabling communications with two or more spacecraft simultaneously. In March 2019, Boeing was selected to provide five Boeing 737 AEW&C; to the Royal Air Force. Michael Arthur succeeds Marc Allen as president of Boeing International in April 2019, becoming the first non-U.S. citizen to join the company's executive council. In June, Sir Martin Donnelly is appointed the new managing director of Boeing UK & Ireland and president of Boeing Europe. Boeing Defence UK Boeing Defence UK (BDUK) is a subsidiary of Boeing based in the United Kingdom that provides maintenance, support and training services. It has more than 1,400 employees at 25 locations supporting Ministry of Defence (MOD) programmes such as Apache, Chinook, C-17 and P-8A. Since 2019, Anna Keeling serves as the current managing director of BDUK, succeeding David Pitchforth who had been in the position since 2012. BDUK consists of four business units: MOD Services, training, government services and advanced programmes. =History= Boeing Defence UK (BDUK) was established in 1976 as a legal entity to localise the company's defence programmes and in 2008 Boeing fully integrated all of its defence programmes into BDUK in order to create and develop intellectual property within the UK. Michael Kurth was named the first managing director of BDUK in 2007 upon the integration of Boeing's defence programmes and the restructuring of BDUK as a subsidiary. In 2009, the company announced the establishment of UK Rotorcraft Support (RCS), an organisation focused on providing increased capability to the UK military rotorcraft fleet. RCS provides support for the UK‚Äôs fleet of 60+ Chinook helicopters with the Through Life Customer Support (TLCS), Digital Automatic Flight Control System (DAFCS) and Chinook Engine Support Arrangement (CESA). In partnership with the American manufacturing company John Deere, BDUK developed the R-Gator A3 Assisted Carriage System (ACS) in 2011. The R-Gator A3 ACS is based on John Deere‚Äôs R-Gator robotic utility vehicle and was designed to help reduce the amount of weight soldiers have to carry in the field. David Pitchforth, who was managing director of UK Rotocraft support at the time, succeeded Michael Kurth as managing director of BDUK in December 2012 after Kurth's appointment as vice president and general manager of Unmanned Airborne Systems Programs. BDUK was the first company to sign up to the MOD new Defence and Security Industrial Engagement Policy in 2012, a policy encouraging overseas-based companies to make a firm commitment to continue business activities in the United Kingdom for the long term. In 2013, the MOD contracted BDUK and Boeing's subsidiary Insitu for the supply of the ScanEagle unmanned aerial system as a maritime intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) asset. It was the first drone to be used by the Royal Navy and the contract was worth ¬£30 million. In April 2016 BDUK was awarded a contract to become strategic IT partner to Staffordshire Police, said to be the first IT partnership in policing in the UK. BDUK provided the sound effects of the interior helicopter cabin for the Virtual Reality Chinook project that was created to help train medical personnel of the UK Armed Forces in June 2016. The same year, BDUK was given a Gold Award by Sir Michael Fallon in recognition of supporting Armed Forces personnel and their families under the Employer Recognition Scheme (ERS). BDUK has maintained a close partnership with UK government with several future programmes such as the purchase of 50 Apache AH-64E model attack helicopters in 2016. It is part of the Foreign Military Sale (FMS) upgrade programme which would see current Apache models being upgraded to the newer model. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson signed a ¬£1.51 billion deal with Boeing to purchase five E-7 aircraft in March 2019, replacing the Boeing E-3 Sentry aircraft currently in service.

History The first cathedral (considered a pro-cathedral) building was inaugurated in 1881 and built by stonemasons and architects Lazarus Borges da Silva and Francisco Nobre. After the death of Bishop Ferdinand Terrien in 1929, this original cathedral saw the ordination of the first three Yoruba priests, the late monsignors Lawrence Layode, Julius Onih, and Stephen Adewuyi, by Bishop Thomas Brodericks, the apostolic vicar of Western Nigeria. By the 1930s a larger cathedral was needed, and the older one was demolished. The current church building, of French Gothic style architecture, had its foundation stone laid on 6 August 1934 by Bishop Francis O'Rourke and was completed in 1939. On 18 April 1950, the apostolic vicariate of Lagos was elevated to metropolitan archdiocese in accordance with the papal bull entitled Laeto accepimus, issued by Pope Pius XII. By year-end 2016, the archdiocese counted 3,274,000 baptized out of a total population of 12,276,000 which corresponds to 26.7% of the total.

The cultural center, known as Schlachthof, was founded in 1994. It offers two concert halls for events from 300 to 2,000 people; the large concert hall has an area of about 1,200 square meters. The location is used for concert in rock, metal and punk, for music parties, poetry slams and readings. It is surrounded by a leisure park.  History  The slaughterhouse closed in 1990 due to inefficiency and non-compliance with EC hygiene guidelines. In the following years, most of the abandoned buildings were torn down. Only two halls and a 36 meters high, historic water tower (built 1897-1899) remained. In 1994 these remaining buildings were occupied by the Kulturzentrum Schlachthof. While the large hall served from 1994-2010 for large concerts and parties, smaller concerts took place in the former smoke house from 1994 to 2015. This building also contained rehearsal rooms and studios. Among the groups performing at the Schlachthof are The Sisters of Mercy, Mot√∂rhead, Simple Minds, Apocalyptica, Dropkick Murphys, Die Fantastischen Vier, Die Toten Hosen, Bullet for My Valentine, Sportfreunde Stiller, Deichkind und Fettes Brot, in around 150 concerts per year. The Finnish band Nightwish produced a video, Wish I Had An Angel, which shows the buildings, then with singer Tarja Turunen. After the great concert hall had to close in 2010 due to danger of collapse, a new concert hall was inaugurated in November 2012. The historic water tower was renovated for E4.5 million and inaugurated in March 2015, marking the end of a five-year renovation program for the entire complex. It is now used as an office building; its outbuildings are used for small concerts and house a bar. The last of the old slaughterhouse buildings was torn down in 2015. In 2008 the approximately 3 hectares of fallow land around the historic water tower and the former slaughterhouse were remodeled for leisure and cultural park with tree plantings, walk lawns, a beach volleyball court, a boule court, a track for skateboarders and children's play equipment.

It was established after two secondary colleges, Ballarat Boys' Technical School and Ballarat Girls' High School amalgamated in 1981. The college is located in Mount Clear, 7 km from Ballarat's central business district. History Ballarat Technical School was founded as a boys' school in 1913,http://federation.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/179912/FedUni- Timeline_Dec2014.pdf and was officially opened in July 1915 by Sir Alexander Peacock. In 1976, following the successful amalgamation of the Ballarat Technical School and the Ballarat Girls' High School (est. 1951), Mount Clear Technical High School opened as a school for years 7 to 10 students. Both of those schools had a rich tradition that started in 1874. The Technical school, known as ‚ÄùCentral Tech‚Äù, was located in Lydiard St South in the CBD and the High School, known as the ‚ÄúGirls School‚Äù, was located in Barkly Street, Ballarat East. In 1977 four mini schools were established. One was for students at the Lydiard Street campus. It was known as Lalor Mini School. Students at the old Girls High site were part of the Barkly Mini School. In that year all new year 7 students were based at the Mount Clear campus. Two new mini schools, Canadian and Currawong were also added. In October 1981, a new building designed around the concept of the mini schools was completed. Students from Lalor Mini School were the first to move into the new building. By the end of that year all students had moved to the new site which was immediately to the east of the Mount Clear Recreation Reserve and just north of the former Mount Clear Railway Station. In the mid 1980s, in response to school community concerns, year 11 and 12 began to be taught at the school. The names of the mini schools have been retained in the forms of the house names, and on the logo. In 2002 the official name of Mount Clear College was adopted.  Curriculum  The school focuses on the eight Key Learning Areas: English, Creative and Performing Arts, Health and Physical Education, Languages, Science, Mathematics, Studies Of Society & Environment, and Technology. The College offers Japanese or Chinese to students from Year 7 to 12. In the final years students complete VCE, VET or VCAL. Students in Year 6 can apply for the SEAL Program (Select Entry Accelerated Learning). The program allows students to effectively complete Years 7‚Äì10 in three years, instead of four.

Yaniv War Memorial \\"On the Dnieper in 1943\\" Part of the (now defunct) Chernobyl Raion, ten years after the construction of the nuclear plant in 1970, Yaniv became administratively part of the new adjacent city of Pripyat, founded in the same year. Immediately after the Chernobyl disaster, on April 27, 1986, the 100 villagers were completely evacuated and resettled elsewhere, due to the high level of radioactive contamination. Because of the impossibility of effective decontamination of most buildings, they were destroyed and buried in 1987. The village, deregistered on April 1, 2003, is included in the \\"10 Km Zone\\" of the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. De jure, it still belongs to Pripyat, which didn't lose its status of \\"city of regional significance\\", but is de facto part of Ivankiv Raion.

The owners, Gerd Sch√ºler and Michael Presinger, opened the club on 8 November 1978. The idea was to offer similar events as New York's famous club Studio 54. This was one of the largest nightclubs in Germany at that time. The design of the nightclub cost more than 2.5million Deutsche Marks and laid the cornerstone for the successful Airport club brand. The name of the club comes from Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. Dorian Gray was, unusually for a nightclub, located in Hall C of the airport's Terminal 1 building. For this reason, the nightclub remained opened during early morning hours, while the rest of the airport remained closed.  Music  Fur exhibition at Dorian Gray (1981) Up to 2500 guests danced on three dancefloors (Runningman, Studio 54 and Chillout)‚Äì End of 1970s to Disco, Funk und Soul, and later, from 1984 onwards, to Electronic dance music such as EBM, House, New wave and Techno, and from 1992 to urban music in the smaller section of the club. Famous DJs who played at Dorian Gray were Carl Cox, Paul van Dyk, Sven V√§th, Torsten Fenslau, Ulli Brenner, Michael M√ºnzing (one half of Snap!), DJ Dag, Talla 2XLC, Tom Wax, Mark Spoon, Heinz Felber, Pete Marvelous, Paul Oakenfold, Pascal FEOS, Bj√∂rn Mulik and Andy D√ºx.  Tone and light effects  The nightclub had at the time a spectacular Richard-Long-Sound-System-Design. which used large sound system speakers with a JBL and Gauss-Alnico base sound system which produced loud and clear sound. The DJ equipment consisted of Thorens and later from mid-1990s Technics turntables. The light system was made out of red, green and orange colours which were positioned to reflect the mirrors on the floor. Until the mid-1990s a strong laser show was used. One of the video jockeys was also Alexander Metzger.  Closure  On 31 December 2000 the nightclub ceased operations in Frankfurt am Main, due to continuing problems in securing fire safety certification from the airport inspectorate. The last record that was played on the closure was ‚ÄûLovin‚Äô You‚Äú from musician Minnie Riperton and was played by the resident DJ Ufuk in the small club. Several years after the closure of the nightclub, the painted entrance doors were still visible with the original image. In January 2008 the existing space in Hall C was renovated into a shopping area.  Various  In the early 2003 both of the original owners started a newly opened nightclub in Berlin on Potsdamer Platz, which couldn't reach the fame of the original nightclub and therefore ceased to operate. The sister nightclub of Dorian Gray in Perkins Park in Stuttgart, which opened in 1980 with the similar idea of events still operates today. In the years 2006-2008 there were dedicated party events at the end of the year called Airport-Night to remember the days when Dorian Gray existed.

Zaynab delivered a defiant sermon in the court of Yazid in which she humiliated Yazid and exposed his army's atrocities while honoring the Ahl al-Bayt and those killed in Karbala and expounding upon the eternal consequences of the battle. Zaynab bint Ali Zaynab bint Ali () was one of the daughters of Ali and Fatimah. Like other members of her family she became a great figure of sacrifice, strength, and piety in Islamin both the Sunni and Shia sects of the religion. Zaynab married Abdullah ibn Ja'far and had three sons and two daughters. When her brother Husayn defended Islam and opposed the tyranny of Yazid caliph in 680AD (61AH), Zaynab accompanied his companions, 72 men who, together with Husayn, were brutally slain by government forces numbering 30,000 men at the Battle of Karbala. Zaynab played an important role in disclosing the true events leading up to the massacre of the third Shia Imam Husayn, and his supporters. She also protected the life of her nephew Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin, the fourth Shia Imam, as he lay seriously ill and unable to go to the battlefield. Because of her sacrifice and heroism, she became known as the \\"Hero of Karbala\\". Zaynab died in 681, and her shrine is located in Damascus, Syria.Esposito, J. L., ., The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, New York:2003 Background After the battle of Karbala the captured family of the prophet and the heads of those who were killed were taken to the Levant by the forces of Yazid. On the first day of the month of Safar, according to Turabi, they arrived in the Levant and the captured family and heads were taken into Yazid's presence. First, the identity of each head was told to him. Then he paid attention to a woman who was objecting. Yazid asked, \\"Who is this arrogant woman?\\" All the audience paused for a moment. The woman rose to answer and said: \\"Why are you asking them [the woman]? Ask me. I'll tell you [who I am]. I am Muhammad's granddaughter. I am Fatima's daughter.\\" People at the court were impressed and amazed by her. According to the narration of Al- Shaykh Al-Mufid, in Yazid's presence a man with red skin asked Yazid for one of the captured women to be his slave. Yazid hit the lips and teeth of Hussein with his stick while saying: \\"I wish those of my clan who were killed at Badr, and those who had seen the Khazraj clan wailing (in the battle of Uhad) on account of lancet wounds, were here. At this time, Zaynab bint Ali began to give her sermon. Context Tilework inside Mu'awin ul-Mulk Hussainiya, Kermanshah, Iran, depicting Ali ibn Husayn, Zaynab, and other prisoners taken to the Yazdi court Zaynab bint Ali started her sermon with the praise of Allah: =God gives time to disbelievers= Verse 187 of chapter of Al Imran was descended about polytheists of Mecca such as Abu Sufyan ibn Harb. Zainab bint Ali once again relates this verse to Yazid, grandson of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb. She said: \\"Do not be satisfied with this temporal achievement; this time passes quickly and Allah will punish you. You will be humiliated.\\" As we see in the sermon: =Humiliate the enemy and honoring the Ahl al-Bayt = One concern of Zaynab bint Ali in the battle of Karbala was the humiliation of the enemy and the honor of the Ahl al-Bayt. =Position of those killed in Karbala = Zaynab bint Ali tells Yazid not to be happy because of his victory. She named verse 169 of AlImran and emphasized that those dying for a just cause are victors and that Yazid's happiness will end with the torture of Allah. =Referring to the oppression= At this point in the sermon she referred to all the oppression and injustices of the Umayyad from time of Abu Sufyan till the time of Yazid ibn Muawiyah. She also believed that the Umayyad owed their power to the Islamic Ummah's failure to uphold the Quran and the rightful succession to Muhammad. She further stated that: =External consequences of the battle= Zaynab bint Ali stated that the battle of Karbala had a positive effect on history. She believed that jihad, struggle in the path of Allah, had eternal effects.

Peng Yu, also referred to as the Peng Yu Case or the Nanjing Peng Yu Incident, was a civil lawsuit in the People's Republic of China, brought before the Nanjing District Court in 2007. In 2006, Peng Yu had encountered Xu Shoulan after she had fallen and broken her femur. Peng Yu assisted Xu Shoulan and brought her to a local hospital for further care. Xu Shoulan accused Peng Yu of having caused her to fall, and demanded that he pay her medical expenses. The court decided in favor of the plaintiff and held Peng liable for damages, reasoning that despite the lack of concrete evidence, \\"no one would in good conscience help someone unless they felt guilty\\". The verdict received widespread media coverage, and engendered a public outcry against the decision. It is regarded as a landmark case because of its implication that the Chinese public is vulnerable to civil liability for lending help in emergency situations due to the lack of any Good Samaritan laws.  The incident  November 20, 2006, Peng Yu encountered Xu Shoulan, an elderly lady, after she had disembarked from a city bus and fallen. Peng brought Xu to the hospital, and contributed 200 RMB towards her treatment. At the hospital, Xu was diagnosed with a fractured femur and was told that she would have to undergo femur replacement surgery. Xu demanded that Peng pay for her medical costs, and when he refused, sued him for personal injury compensation, claiming that he caused her fall. After out-of-court mediation failed, the case was brought before the Gulou District Court in Nanjing on April 1, 2007. In court, Xu claimed that she had seen that Peng bumped into her, whereas Peng maintained that he only approached Xu after he had seen her fall. An eyewitness present at the scene, Chen Erchun, claimed that Xu had inexplicably fallen as she was transferring between two buses. He maintained that Peng had only arrived at the scene after Xu had fallen, and that he himself had assisted the two of them in calling Xu's relatives. These statements were categorically rejected by Xu Shoulan at the third court hearing. The case concluded with Peng admitting to have accidentally pushed Xu as he was getting off the bus, and agreed to pay her 10,000 yuan compensation in the settlement reached in March 2008. The two sides withdrew their appeals and came to an agreement that they would not disclose details of the case.

He is a 6-time Grammy Award winner, and has participated in the making of numerous albums that have resulted in Grammy Award nominations and winners. Also known by the nickname, \\"Dr Vibb,\\" he has creatively recorded or mixed many multi-platinum artists in many genres, including Michael Jackson, Aerosmith, The Pussycat Dolls, Bon Jovi, Natasha Bedingfield, Green Day, Trace Adkins, Faith Hill, Toby Keith, Ice Cube, Boyz II Men, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Chick Corea, Brad Paisley, Ringo Starr, Mariah Carey and Tony Bennett. Early life Vibberts started playing the drums at 8 years old, progressing to playing in a band as a teenager. While recording, he was more interested as to what was going on in the control room, and thereafter changed career direction. Career After graduating from Portland High School (Connecticut) in 1986, Vibberts spent a year in college studying astronomy before transferring to the music production and engineering program at Berklee College of Music in Boston. Upon graduation in 1991, he moved to New York City and began his career at Right Track Recording. It was there he started working with artists such as Mariah Carey, Living Colour, and the Brecker Brothers. In 1993, he had an opportunity to work at the Hit Factory, to enhance his recording and mixing skills. From 1993 to 1995, he worked with artists such as Paul Simon, Billy Joel, Celine Dion, Meat Loaf, David Lee Roth and Dave Matthews Band. He also spent an entire year with Michael Jackson working on the album HIStory, which brought his career and their friendship to new heights. Opportunities expanded his expertise from album work to the ability of recording and mixing full orchestras. He raised the bar in the audio engineering field by working with Shawn Murphy, Dan Wallin, John McClure, and Michael Farrow on film scores, Broadway cast albums and Disney Feature Animated films. Vibberts continued fine-tuning his artistic craft of recording and mixing by co-working with the experienced engineers and producers that he admired. These world-renowned experts like George Martin, Bruce Swedien, David Foster, Walter Afanasieff, Nile Rodgers, Al Schmitt, Tom Lord-Alge, Arif Mardin, Jimmy Jam, Terry Lewis, Tommy LiPuma and Trevor Rabin helped him accomplish high quality studio work. Because of the excellent work he achieved at the Hit Factory, he kept gaining the artists' and producers' respect, which led to more engineering jobs for Kathleen Battle, Heavy D, and additional recording sessions for Michael Jackson. During the three years of working at the Hit Factory, he did sessions with record executives Tommy Mottola, Clive Davis, Don Ienner, Ahmet Ertegun, and Dave Glew. From 1995 to 2000, Vibberts was hired as a staff engineer at Sony Music Studios and continued his high standards of engineering when working on sessions with artists such as Tony Bennett, Mariah Carey, Sting, Garth Brooks, Lauryn Hill, Jewel, Bruce Springsteen, and producers such as Phil Ramone, Jack Douglas, and Daniel Lanois. One of the highlights of his career was mixing half of the Herbie Hancock album Gershwin's World, recommended by Bruce Swedien. The album won four out of the five Grammy Awards it was nominated for, including Jazz Album of the Year. From 2000, Vibberts relocated to Los Angeles, where he was hired by Ocean Way Recording, and periodically worked with established producer and mixer Jack Joseph Puig until 2005. The move opened opportunities to work with Mick Jagger, Fiona Apple, Paul McCartney, Tim McGraw, Clint Black, Joss Stone, The Counting Crows, Eartha Kitt and Bon Jovi. In 2002, he worked on the 2002 MTV Icon Award for Aerosmith, with Pink, Shakira, Train, and Janet Jackson. Another project was working on the 2003 MTV Icon Award show for Metallica, with Avril Lavigne, Sum 41, Limp Bizkit, Korn, and Staind. Vibberts partnered with Effanel Music on these live shows: Vibberts was a broadcast mixer for the Budweiser Made in America Festival in Los Angeles, NewNowNext Awards 2013, Tegan and Sara, Kesha, and VH1's Do Something Awards 2013, mixing Sara Bareilles. He also recorded the Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z Legends of the Summer Tour at the Rose Bowl Stadium where he partnered with Music Mix Mobile (which is a remote recording truck) for this recording. From 2009 to the present day, Vibberts has been co-founder, producer and engineer at Spotlight 87 Entertainment.

It has no showrooms and is limited to screening the films in a single cinema with 165 seats, as well as collecting, archiving, and restoring film copies. All analog and digital formats (except 70mm) can be shown.  History  The Film Museum was founded in late 1963 as a department of the Munich Stadtmuseum and holds an extensive collection of copies of historical films. Which are also restored and copied locally. Special focus is placed on the collection of German silent films, the work of the German film immigrants from the Nazism period, the New German Cinema, as well as the Munich film history (e.g. Karl Valentin, Herbert Achternbusch, documentary material about Munich). As cinematheque, the museum makes its collection accessible to public and research. The in-house cinema - one of the first municipal theaters of the Federal Republic of Germany - is one of the few places in Germany, in which full historical-film retrospectives and silent films with live musical accompaniment are regularly presented. The museum does not have a permanent exhibition. Yearlong efforts in the 1980s and 1990s to attain a second cinema and an appreciation of the cinema through separation from the Munich Stadtmuseum and a renaming to the Bavarian Film Museum were unsuccessful. The Munich Film Museum has been pioneering work in the restoration of films since the 1970s. The then head, Enno Patalas, began with the restoration of German silent films from directors such as Fritz Lang, Ernst Lubitsch, G.W. Pabst or F. W. Murnau. Patalas undertook pianist Aljoscha Zimmermann as the cinema pianist. Zimmermann researched for the original scores or wrote accompanying music. The film museum houses the cinematic works of filmmakers, who as frontier workers cannot be assigned a national film archive, such as Orson Welles, Thomas Harlan, Jean-Marie Straub and Dani√®le Huillet, Nicolas Humbert, Werner Schroeter and Wim Wenders. Since 1995, the museum possesses the estates of Orson Welles, in particular to the materials of unfinished films. The museum was given the Welles estates from his last companion Oja Kodar. In 2006, the museum published its reconstructions and restorations on DVD in the Edition Filmmuseum. The film museum is, since 2012, co-organizer of the annual film screenings of Filmfest M√ºnchen and the International Festival of the University of Television and Film Munich. The museum is co-organizer of the Internationale Stummfilmtage (International Silent Film Festival) in Bonn and displays a selection of the program later in Munich.

The Pensacola Jaycees were declared winners of their local district by Little League headquarters in Williamsport, Pennsylvania after local officials refused to allow them to play against the all-white teams. Pensacola advanced to the Florida State Tournament which was held at Lake Lorna Doone Park. Pensacola drew a bye in the first round of the six-team state championship series and lost to host Orlando in the second round, 5-0.http://www.afro.com/afro-archives- editions/?nid=UBnQDr5gPskC&dat;=19020104&printsec;=frontpage page 9 The 1955 season was the first after US Supreme Court rulings had eliminated \\"separate but equal\\" conditions in the nation's schools and public parks. Florida State Little League and City of Orlando officials fully cooperated with Little League headquarters in Williamsport, Pennsylvania to support the playing of the game. By all accounts, the game was played without incident and newspapers reported that the hometown crowd cheered the visiting team and offered words of encouragement. This was in stark contrast to South Carolina, where state and local officials refused to allow their state tournament to be played because of the presence of an African-American team, and forfeited sending a state representative to their regional tournament. In 1963, Lake Lorna Doone Park once again hosted the Florida State Little League Tournament.http://www.unpage.org/florida/fl-1960s.htm References  Category:Parks in Florida Category:Geography of Orlando, Florida ","title":"Lake Lorna Doone Park"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:M}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your libraryü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const D=d(P,[["render",R]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/64.md","filePath":"quotes/64.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/64.md"},E=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(D)]))}});export{F as __pageData,E as default};
