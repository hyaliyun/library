The bridge—designed by Sir Thomas Bouch—used lattice girders supported by iron piers, with cast iron columns and wrought iron cross-bracing. The piers were narrower and their cross-bracing was less extensive and robust than on previous similar designs by Bouch. Bouch had sought expert advice on wind loading when designing a proposed rail bridge over the Firth of Forth; as a result of that advice he had made no explicit allowance for wind loading in the design of the Tay Bridge. There were other flaws in detailed design, in maintenance, and in quality control of castings, all of which were, at least in part, Bouch's responsibility. Bouch died less than a year after the disaster, his reputation ruined. Future British bridge designs had to allow for wind loadings of up to . Bouch's design for the Forth Bridge was not used. Bridge Original Tay Bridge from the north Construction began in 1871 of a bridge to be supported by brick piers resting on bedrock. Trial borings had shown the bedrock to lie at no great depth under the river. At either end of the bridge, the bridge girders were deck trusses, the tops of which were level with the pier tops, with the single track railway running on top. However, in the centre section of the bridge (the \\"high girders\\") the bridge girders ran as through trusses above the pier tops (with the railway inside them) in order to give the required clearance to allow passage of sailing ships to Perth.Bridge design is described (intermittently) in Minutes of Evidence pp. 241–271(H Law); the bridge design process in Minutes of Evidence pp. 398–408 (Sir Thomas Bouch) The bedrock lay much deeper than the trial borings had shown, and Bouch had to redesign the bridge, with fewer piers and correspondingly longer span girders. The pier foundations were now constructed by sinking brick-lined wrought-iron caissons onto the riverbed, and filling these with concrete. To reduce the weight these had to support, Bouch used open-lattice iron skeleton piers: each pier had multiple cast-iron columns taking the weight of the bridging girders. Wrought iron horizontal braces and diagonal tiebars linked the columns in each pier to provide rigidity and stability. The basic concept was well known, but for the Tay Bridge, the pier dimensions were constrained by the caisson. For the higher portion of the bridge, there were thirteen girder spans. In order to accommodate thermal expansion, at only three of their fourteen piers was there a fixed connection from the pier to the girders. There were therefore three divisions of linked high girder spans, the spans in each division being structurally connected to each other, but not to neighbouring spans in other divisions.Minutes of Evidence pp. 241–271(H Law) The southern and central divisions were nearly level, but the northern division descended towards Dundee at gradients of up to 1 in 73.Report of Court of Inquiry – Appendix 3 The bridge was built by Hopkin Gilkes and Company, a Middlesbrough company which had worked previously with Bouch on iron viaducts. Gilkes, having first intended to produce all ironwork on Teesside, used a foundry at Wormit to produce the cast-iron components, and to carry out limited post-casting machining. Gilkes were in some financial difficulty; they ceased trading in 1880, but had begun liquidation in May 1879, before the disaster. Bouch's brother had been a director of Gilkes, and all three had been colleagues on the Stockton and Darlington 30 years previously; on Gilkes's death in January 1876, Bouch had inherited shares valued at £35,000 but also owed for a guarantee of £100,000 of Gilkes borrowings and been unable to extricate himself.Mins of Ev p. 440 (Sir T Bouch) The change in design increased cost and necessitated delay, intensified after two of the high girders fell when being lifted into place in February 1877. The first engine crossed the bridge in September, 1877. A Board of Trade inspection was conducted over three days of good weather in February 1878; the bridge was passed for use by passenger traffic, subject to a speed limit. The inspection report noted: > When again visiting the spot I should wish, if possible, to have an > opportunity of observing the effects of high wind when a train of carriages > is running over the bridge. The bridge was opened for passenger services on 1 June 1878. Bouch was knighted in June 1879 soon after Queen Victoria had used the bridge. Disaster On the evening of Sunday 28 December 1879, a violent storm (10 to 11 on the Beaufort scale) was blowing virtually at right angles to the bridge.Mins of Ev p. 24 (Captain Scott) Witnesses said the storm was as bad as any they had seen in the 20–30 years they had lived in the area;Mins of Ev p. 15 (James Black Lawson)Mins of Ev p. 33 (Capt John Greig) one called it a 'hurricane', as bad as a typhoon he had seen in the China Sea.Mins of Ev p. 18 (George Clark) The wind speed was measured at Glasgow – (averaged over an hour) – and Aberdeen, but not at Dundee. Higher windspeeds were recorded over shorter intervals, but at the inquiry an expert witness warned of their unreliability, and declined to estimate conditions at Dundee from readings taken elsewhere.Mins of Ev p. 392 (Robert Henry Scott, MA FRS, Secretary to the Meteorological Council) One modern interpretation of available information suggests winds were gusting to . Use of the bridge was restricted to one train at a time by a signalling block system using a baton as a token. At 7:13 p.m. a train from Burntisland (consisting of a 4-4-0 locomotive, its tender, five passenger carriages, and a luggage van, slowed to pick up the baton from the signal cabin at the south end of the bridge, then headed out onto the bridge, picking up speed. The signalman turned away to log this and then tended the cabin fire, but a friend present in the cabin watched the train: when it got about from the cabin he saw sparks flying from the wheels on the east side. He had also seen this on the previous train.Mins of Ev p. 79 (John Black) During the inquiry, John Black testified that the wind was pushing the wheel flanges into contact with the running rail. Black explained that the guard rails protecting against derailment were slightly higher than and inboard of the running rails. This arrangement would catch the good wheel where derailment was by disintegration of a wheel, which was a real risk before steel wheels, and had occurred in the Shipton-on-Cherwell train crash on Christmas Eve 1874. The sparks continued for no more than three minutes, by which time the train was in the high girders.Mins of Ev p. 7 (John Watt) At that point \\"there was a sudden bright flash of light, and in an instant there was total darkness, the tail lamps of the train, the sparks and the flash of light all ... disappearing at the same instant.\\" The signalman saw none of this and did not believe it when told about it. When the train failed to appear on the line off the bridge into Dundee he tried to talk to the signal cabin at the north end of the bridge, but found that all communication with it had been lost.Mins of Ev p. 5 (Thomas Barclay) Not only was the train in the river, but so were the high girders, and much of the ironwork of their supporting piers.Photographs of the damaged piers and of recovered wreckage are accessible at Divers exploring the wreckage later found the train still within the girders, with the engine in the fifth span of the southern 5-span division.Mins of Ev p. 39 (Edward Simpson) There were no survivors; only 46 bodies were recovered but there were 59 known victims. Fifty-six tickets for Dundee had been collected from passengers on the train before crossing the bridge; allowing for season ticket holders, tickets for other destinations, and for railway employees, 74 or 75 people were believed to have been on the train.Report of the Court of Inquiry page 9 It has been suggested that there were no unknown victims and that the higher figure arises from double-counting in an early newspaper report, but the inquiry did not take its casualty figures from the Dundee Courier; it took sworn evidence and did its own sums.

By 3 January 1880, they were taking evidence in Dundee; they then appointed Henry Law (a qualified civil engineer) to undertake detailed investigations. Whilst awaiting his report they held further hearings in Dundee (26 February – 3 March); having got it they sat at Westminster (19 April – 8 May) to consider the engineering aspects of the collapse.Report of the Court of Inquiry, page 3 By then railway, contractor and designer had separate legal representation, and the North British Railway (NBR) had sought independent advice (from James Brunlees and John Cochrane, both engineers with extensive experience of major cast-iron structures). The terms of reference did not specify the underlying purpose of the inquiry – to prevent a repetition, to allocate blame, to apportion liability or culpability, or to establish what precisely had happened. This led to difficulties (culminating in clashes) during the Westminster sessions and when the court reported their findings at the end of June, there was both an Inquiry Report signed by Barlow and Yolland and a minority report by Rothery. Other eyewitnesses Two witnesses, viewing the high girders from the north almost end-on, had seen the lights of the train as far as the 3rd–4th high girder, when they disappeared; this was followed by three flashes from the high girders north of the train. One witness said these advanced to the north end of the high girders with about 15 seconds between first and last;Mins of Ev p. 19 (Alexander Maxwell) the other that they were all at the north end, with less time between.Mins of Ev p. 19 (William Abercrombie Clark) A third witness had seen \\"a mass of fire fall from the bridge\\" at the north end of the high girders.Mins of Ev p. 16 (James Black Lawson) A fourth said he had seen a girder fall into the river at the north end of the high girders, then a light had briefly appeared in the southern high girders, disappearing when another girder fell; he made no mention of fire or flashes.Mins of Ev p. 53 (Peter Barron) 'Ex-Provost' Robertson had a good view of most of the bridge from his house in Newport-on-Tay, but other buildings blocked his view of the southern high girders. He had seen the train move onto the bridge; then in the northern high girders, before the train could have reached them, he saw \\"two columns of spray illuminated with the light, first one flash and then another\\" and could no longer see the lights on the bridge; the only inference he could draw was that the lit columns of spray – slanting from north to south at about 75 degrees – were areas of spray lit up by the bridge lights as it turned over.Mins of Ev pp. 58–59 (William Robertson) How the bridge was used – speed of trains and oscillation of bridge Ex-provost Robertson had bought a season ticket between Dundee and Newport at the start of November, and became concerned about the speed of north-bound local trains through the high girders, which had been causing perceptible vibration, both vertical and lateral. After complaining on three occasions to the stationmaster at Dundee, with no effect on train speed, after mid-December he had used his season ticket to travel south only, using the ferry for north-bound crossings. Robertson had timed the train with his pocket watch, and to give the railway the benefit of the doubt he had rounded up to the nearest five seconds. The measured time through the girders () was normally 65 or 60 seconds, but twice it had been 50 seconds. When observing from the shore, he had measured 80 seconds for trains travelling through the girders, but not on any train he had travelled on. North-bound local trains were often held up to avoid delaying expresses, and then made up time while travelling over the bridge. The gradient onto the bridge at the northern end prevented similar high speeds on south-bound locals. Robertson said that the movement he observed was hard to quantify, although the lateral movement, which was probably , was definitely due to the bridge, not the train, and the effect was more marked at high speed. Four other train passengers supported Robertson's timings but only one had noticed any movement of the bridge.Mins of Ev (pp. 65–72): Thomas Downing Baxter (speed only), George Thomas Hume (speed only), Alexander Hutchinson (speed and movement) and (p. 88) Dr James Miller (speed only) The Dundee stationmaster had passed Robertson's complaint about speed (he had been unaware of any concern about oscillation) on to the drivers, and then checked times from cabin to cabin (at either end of the bridge the train was travelling slowly to pick up or hand over the baton). However he had never checked speed through the high girders.Mins of Ev pp. 72–76 (James Smith) Painters who had worked on the bridge in mid-1879 said that it shook when a train was on it.Mins of Ev pp. 88–97 (David Pirie, Peter Robertson, John Milne, Peter Donegany, David Dale, John Evans) When a train entered the southern high girders the bridge had shaken at the north end, both east–west and, more strongly, up-and-down.Mins of Ev p. 91 (Peter Donegany) The shaking was worse when trains were going faster, which they did: \\"when the Fife boat was nearly over and the train had only got to the south end of the bridge it was a hard drive\\".Mins of Ev p. 95 (John Evans) A joiner who had worked on the bridge from May to October 1879 also spoke of a lateral shaking, which was more alarming than the up-and-down motion, and greatest at the southern junction between the high girders and the low girders. He was unwilling to quantify the amplitude of motion, but when pressed he offered . When pressed further he would only say that it was distinct, large, and visible.Mins of Ev pp. 101–103 (Alexander Stewart) One of the painters' foremen, however, said the only motion he had seen had been north–south, and that this had been less than .Mins of Ev pp. 124–125 (Edward Simpson) How the bridge was maintained – chattering ties and cracked columns The North British Railway maintained the tracks, but it retained Bouch to supervise maintenance of the bridge. He appointed Henry Noble as his bridge inspector.Mins of Ev pp. 215–225 (Henry Abel Noble) Noble, who was a bricklayer, not an engineer, had worked for Bouch on the construction of the bridge.Mins of Ev pp. 409–410 (Sir Thomas Bouch) Whilst checking the pier foundations to see if the river bed was being scoured from around them, Noble had become aware that some diagonal tie bars were 'chattering', and in October 1878 had begun remedying this. Diagonal bracing was by flat bars running from one lug at a column section top to two sling plates bolted to a lug at the base of the equivalent section on an adjacent column. The bar and sling plates all had a matching longitudinal slot in them. The tie bar was placed between the sling plates with all three slots aligned and overlapping, and then a gib was driven through all three slots and secured. Two \\"cotters\\" (metal wedges) were then positioned to fill the rest of the slot overlap, and driven in hard to put the tie under tension. Noble had assumed the cotters were too small and had not been driven up hard in the first place, but on the chattering ties the cotters were loose, and even if driven fully in would not fill the slot and put the bar under tension. By fitting an additional packing piece between loose cotters and driving the cotters in, Noble had re-tightened loose ties and stopped them chattering. There were over 4,000 gib and cotter joints on the bridge, but Noble said that only about 100 had had to be re-tensioned, most in October–November 1878. On his last check in December 1879, only two ties had needed attention, both on piers north of the high girders. Noble had found cracks in four column sections – one under the high girders, three to the north of them – which had then been bound with wrought iron hoops. Noble had consulted Bouch about the cracked columns, but not the chattering ties.Mins of Ev p. 219 (Henry Abel Noble), confirmed by pp. 427–429 (Sir Thomas Bouch) How the bridge was built – the Wormit foundry The workers at the Wormit foundry complained that the columns had been cast using 'Cleveland iron', which always had scum on it—it was less easy to cast than 'good Scotch metal'Mins of Ev p. 103 (Richard Baird) and more likely to give defective castings. Moulds were damped with salt water,Mins of Ev p. 107 (Richard Baird) cores were inadequately fastened, and moved, giving uneven column wall thickness.Mins of Ev p. 119 (David Hutton) The foundry foreman explained that where lugs had been imperfectly cast; the missing metal was added by 'burning on'. If a casting had blowholes or other casting defects considered to be minor faults, they were filled with 'Beaumont egg' (which the foreman kept a stock of for that purpose) and the casting was used.Mins of Ev pp. 144–152 (Fergus Fergusson) How the bridge was built – management and inspection Gilkes' site staff were inherited from the previous contractor. Under the resident engineer there were seven subordinates including a foundry manager. The original foundry manager left before most of the high girders pier column sections were cast. His replacement was also supervising erection of the bridge, and had no previous experience of supervising foundry work.Mins of Ev p. 164 (Gerrit Willem Camphuis) He was aware of 'burning on',Mins of Ev pp. 158–163 (Gerrit Willem Camphuis) but the use of Beaumont egg had been hidden from him by the foreman.Mins of Ev p. 208 (Alexander Milne) and p. 211 (John Gibb) When shown defects in bridge castings, he said he would not have passed the affected columns for use, nor would he have passed columns with noticeably uneven wall thickness. According to his predecessor, burning-on had only been carried out on temporary 'lifting columns', which were used to allow the girders to be lifted into place and were not part of the permanent bridge structure.Mins of Ev p. 185 (Frank Beattie) That was on the instructions of the resident engineer,Mins of Ev p. 280 (Albert Groethe) who had little foundry experience either and relied upon the foreman.Mins of Ev p. 298 (Albert Groethe) Whilst the working practices were the responsibility of Gilkes, their contract with NBR provided that all work done by the contractor was subject to the approval of the workmanship by Bouch. Hence Bouch would share the blame for any resulting defective work in the finished bridge. The original foundry foreman, who had been dismissed for drunkenness, vouched for Gilkes personally testing for unevenness in the early castings: \\"Mr. Gilkes, sometimes once a fortnight and sometimes once a month, would tap a column with a hammer, first on one side and then on the other, and he used to go over most of them in that way sounding them.\\"Mins of Ev p 154 (Hercules Strachan) Bouch had spent over £9,000 on inspection (his total fee was £10,500) but did not produce any witness who had inspected castings on his behalf. Bouch himself had been up about once a week whilst the design was being changed, but \\"afterwards, when it was all going on, I did not go so often\\". Bouch kept his own 'resident engineer', William Paterson, who looked after the construction of the bridge, its approaches, the line to Leuchars, and the Newport branch. Paterson was also the engineer of the Perth General Station.Mins of Ev p 418 (Sir Thomas Bouch) Bouch told the court that Paterson's age was 'very much mine' but, in fact, Paterson was 12 years older and, by the time of the Inquiry, paralysed and unable to give evidence.Mins of Ev p. 401 (Sir Thomas Bouch) Another inspector appointed later was by then in South Australia and also unable to give evidence. Gilkes' managers could not vouch for any inspection of castings by Bouch's inspectors.Mins of Ev p. 514 (Edgar Gilkes), p. 370 (Frederick William Reeves) and p. 290 (Albert Groethe) The completed bridge had been inspected on Bouch's behalf for quality of assembly, but that was after the bridge had been painted (though still before the bridge opened, and before the painter witnesses were on it in the summer of 1879), which hid any cracks or signs of burning-on (though the inspector said that, in any case, he would not know those signs on sight).Mins of Ev p. 135 (G Macbeath) Throughout construction, Noble had been looking after foundations and brickwork. \\"The evidence of the ruins\\" The bridge after its collapse. Fallen girders, Tay Bridge Henry Law had examined the remains of the bridge; he reported defects in workmanship and design detail. Cochrane and Brunlees, who gave evidence later, largely concurred. Bridge materials Samples of the bridge materials, both cast and wrought iron, were tested by David Kirkaldy, as were a number of bolts, tiebars, and associated lugs. Both the wrought and cast iron had good strength, while the bolts \\"were of sufficient strength and proper iron\\".Mins of Ev p. 483 (Dr William Pole) However, both ties and sound lugs failed at loadings of about 20 tons, well below what had been expected. Both ties and lugs were weakened by high local stresses where the bolt bore on them. Four of the fourteen lugs tested were unsound, having failed at lower than expected loadings. Some column top lugs outlasted the wrought iron, but the bottom lugs were significantly weaker.Mins of Ev pp. 303–304 (Henry Law) =Opinions and analysis= Windloading =Windloading assumed in design= Bouch had designed the bridge, assisted in his calculations by Allan Stewart. After the accident Stewart had assisted William Pole in calculating what the bridge should have withstood. On the authority of Stewart they had assumed that the bridge was designed against a wind loading of 'with the usual margin of safety'.p. xiv of Appendix to Report of Inquiry Bouch said that whilst had been discussed, he had been 'guided by the report on the Forth Bridge' to assume and therefore made no special allowance for wind loading.Mins of Ev p. 420 (Sir Thomas Bouch) He was referring to advice given by the Astronomer Royal, Sir George Biddell Airy in 1873 when consulted about Bouch's design for a suspension bridge across the Firth of Forth; that wind pressures as high as might be encountered very locally, but averaged over a span would be a reasonable allowance.Mins of Ev p. 381(Sir George Airy) This advice had been endorsed by a number of eminent engineers. Bouch also mentioned advice given by Yolland in 1869 – that the Board of Trade did not require any special allowance for wind loading for spans less than , whilst noting this was for the design of girders not piers. =Opinions on windloading allowance= Evidence was taken from scientists on the current state of knowledge on wind loading and from engineers on the allowance they made for it. Airy said that the advice given was specific to suspension bridges and the Forth; could act over an entire span of the Tay Bridge and he would now advise designing to (i.e. with the usual margin of safety). The highest pressure measured at Greenwich was ; it would probably go higher in Scotland. Sir George Stokes agreed with Airy that 'catspaws', ripples on the water produced by gusts, could have a width of several hundred yards. Standard wind pressure measurements were of hydrostatic pressure which had to be corrected by a factor of 1.4–2 to give total wind loading – with a wind this would be .Mins of Ev pp. 385–391 (George Stokes) Pole referred to Smeaton's work, where high winds were said to give , with higher values being quoted for winds of or above, with the caveat that these were less certain.Mins of Ev p. 464 (Dr William Pole) Brunlees had made no allowance for wind loading on the Solway viaduct because the spans were short and low – if he had had to, he would probably have designed against with a safety margin of 4–5 (by limiting strength of iron). Both Pole and Law had used a treatment from a book by Rankine. Law agreed with Rankine that the highest wind pressure seen in Britain was as the reason for designing to (i.e. with a safety factor of 4); \\" in important structures, I think that the greatest possible margin should be taken. It does not do to speculate upon whether it is a fair estimate or not\\".Mins of Ev p. 321 (Henry Law) Pole had ignored it because no reference was given; he did not believe any engineer paid any attention to it when designing bridges;Mins of Ev p. 471 (Dr William Pole) he thought a reasonable allowance; this was what Robert Stephenson had assumed for the Britannia Bridge. Benjamin Baker said he would design to with a safety margin, but in 15 years of looking he had yet to see wind overthrow a structure that would withstand . He doubted Rankine's pressures because he was not an experimentalist; told that the data were observations by the Regius Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow University he doubted that the Professor had the equipment to take the readings.Mins of Ev pp. 509–10 (Benjamin Baker) =Baker's analysis= Baker argued that the wind pressure on the high girders had been no more than , from the absence of damage to vulnerable features on buildings in Dundee and the signal cabins at the south end of the bridge. The Inquiry felt that these locations were significantly more sheltered, and therefore rejected this argument. Baker's subsequent work on wind pressures at the Forth Rail Bridge site showed meteorologists were overestimating, but his might have over-interpreted the data. Opinions on bridge components Law had numerous criticisms of the bridge design, some echoed by other engineers: *He thought the piers should have been wider (both to counteract toppling and to increase the horizontal component forces the tiebars could withstand) and rectangular (to increase the number of tiebars directly resisting lateral forces); at the very least there should have been lateral bracing between the outermost columns of the piers.Mins of Ev p. 254 (Henry Law) *The lug holes should have been drilled and the tiebars secured by pins filling the holes (rather than bolts). Cochrane testified that he was not surprised that boltholes had been cast conical. He noted that moulders were notorious for this, unless you stood over them. Even so, he would not rely on supervision or inspection, he would have the holes bored or reamed to ensure they were cylindrical because it had an important bearing on the stability of the structure. Pole – called by Bouch's counsel – agreed.Mins of Ev p. 478 (Dr William Pole) *Bouch said if he had known the holes were cast conical he would have had them bored or reamed.Mins of Ev p. 409 (Sir Thomas Bouch) Gilkes said casting lug holes conical would have been done \\"as a matter of course, and unless attention had been drawn to it, it would not be thought then so important as we think it now\\".Mins of Ev p. 521 (Edgar Gilkes) *Cast-on lugs tended to make unsound castings (Cochrane said he had seen examples in the bridge ruinsMins of Ev p. 341 (John Cochrane)) and had prevented facing of the outer side of flanges. Cochrane added that their use meant that columns had had to be cast horizontally rather than vertically, thus giving less satisfactory castings;Mins of Ev p. 354 (John Cochrane), confirmed by Edgar Gilkes (Mins of Ev p. 521) and unless lugs were carefully packed during bolting up they could be damaged or strained.Mins of Ev p. 351 (John Cochrane) *For so tall a pier Gilkes would have preferred some other means of attaching the ties to the columns \\"knowing how treacherous a thing cast iron is, but if an engineer gave me such a thing to make I should make it without question, believing that he had apportioned the strength properly\\". A letter from Bouch to Gilkes on 22 January 1875 had noted that Gilkes was \\"inclined to prefer making the joints of the metal columns the same as on the Beelah and Deepdale\\".Mins of Ev p. 404 (Sir Thomas Bouch) Asked by Rothery why he had departed from the bracing arrangements on the Belah Viaduct, Bouch had referred to changed views on the force of the wind; pressed for other reasons he said Belah-style ties \\"were so much more expensive; this was a saving of money\\".Mins of Ev p. 429 (Sir Thomas Bouch) Modelling of bridge failure and conclusions drawn Both Pole and Law had calculated the wind loading needed to overturn the bridge to be over (taking no credit for holding-down bolts fastening the windward columns to the pier masonry)Mins of Ev p. 470 (Dr William Pole) and concluded that a high wind should have overturned the bridge, rather than cause it to break up (Pole calculated the tension in the ties at windloading to be more than the 'usual margin of safety' value of 5 tons per square inch but still only half the failure tension.Mins of Ev p. 468 (Dr William Pole)) Pole calculated the wind loading required to overturn the lightest carriage in the train (the second-class carriage) to be less than that needed to overturn the bridge; whereas Law – taking credit for more passengers in the carriage than Pole and for the high girders partially shielding carriages from the wind – had reached the opposite conclusion.Mins of Ev p. 308 (Henry Law) =Law: causes were windloading, poor design and poor quality control= Law concluded that the bridge as designed if perfect in execution would not have failed in the way seenMins of Ev p. 307 (Henry Law)(Cochrane went further; it 'would be standing now').Mins of Ev p. 346 (John Cochrane) The calculations assumed the bridge to be largely as designed, with all components in their intended position, and the ties reasonably evenly loaded. If the bridge had failed at lower wind loadings, this was evidence that the defects in design and workmanship he had objected to had given uneven loadings, significantly reduced the bridge strength and invalidated the calculation. Hence =Pole: causes were windloading and impact of derailed carriages= Pole held that the calculation was valid; the defects were self-correcting or had little effect, and some other reason for the failure should be sought. It was the cast iron lugs which had failed; cast iron was vulnerable to shock loadings, and the obvious reason for a shock loading on the lugs was one of the carriages being blown over and into a bridge girder. Baker agreed, but held the wind pressure was not sufficient to blow over a carriage; derailment was either wind-assisted by a different mechanism or coincidental.Mins of Ev p. 512 (Benjamin Baker) (Bouch's own view that collision damage to the girder was the sole cause of bridge collapseMins of Ev p. 415 (Sir Thomas Bouch) found little support). =\\"Did the Train strike the Girders?\\"= Bouch's counsel called witnesses last; hence his first attempts to suggest derailment and collision were made piecemeal in cross- examination of universally unsympathetic expert witnesses. Law had 'not seen anything to indicate that the carriages left the line' (before the bridge collapse)Mins of Ev p. 266 (Henry Law) nor had CochraneMins of Ev p. 345 (John Cochrane) nor Brunlees.Evidence of James Brunlees p.362 – Mins of Ev The physical evidence put to them for derailment and subsequent impact of one or more carriage with the girders was limited. It was suggested that the last two vehicles (the second-class carriage and a brake van) which appeared more damaged were those derailed, but (said Law) they were of less robust construction and the other carriages were not unscathed.Mins of Ev p. 329 (Henry Laws) Cochrane and Brunlees added that both sides of the carriages were damaged \\"very much alike\\".Mins of Ev p. 362 (James Brunlees) Bouch pointed to the rails and their chairs being smashed up in the girder holding the last two carriages, to the axle-box of the second-class carriage having become detached and ending up in the bottom boom of the eastern girder,Mins of Ev p. 441 (James Waddell) to the footboard on the east side of the carriage having been completely carried away, to the girders being broken up, and to marks on the girders showing contact with the carriage roof,Mins of Ev pp. 415–6 (Sir Thomas Bouch) and to a plank with wheel marks on it having been washed up at Newport but unfortunately then washed away.Mins of Ev p. 423 (Sir Thomas Bouch) Bouch's assistant gave evidence of two sets of horizontal scrape marks (very slight scratches in the metal or paint on the girders) matching the heights of the roofs of the last two carriages, but did not know the heights he claimed to be matched.Mins of Ev p. 430 (Charles Meik) At the start of one of these abrasions, a rivet head had lifted and splinters of wood were lodged between a tie bar and a cover plate. Evidence was then given of flange marks on tie bars in the fifth girder (north of the two rearmost carriages), the 'collision with girders' theory being duly modified to everything behind the tender having derailed. However, (it was countered) the girders would have been damaged by their fall regardless of its cause. They had had to be broken up with dynamite before they could be recovered from the bed of the Tay (but only after an unsuccessful attempt to lift the crucial girder in one piece which had broken many girder ties).Mins of Ev pp. 438–9 (John Holdsworth Thomas) The tender coupling (which clearly could not have hit a girder) had also been found in the bottom boom of the eastern girder.Mins of Ev p. 422 (Sir Thomas Bouch) Two marked fifth girder tie bars were produced; one indeed had 3 marks, but two of them were on the underside.Mins of Ev p. 443 (James Waddell) Dugald Drummond, responsible for NBR rolling stock, had examined the wheel flanges and found no 'bruises' – expected if they had smashed up chairs. If the second-class carriage body had hit anything at speed, it would have been 'knocked all to spunks' without affecting the underframe. Had collision with the eastern girder slewed the frame, it would have presented the east side to the oncoming brake van, but it was the west side of the frame that was more damaged. Its eastern footboard had not been carried away; the carriage had never had one (on either side). The graze marks were at above the rail, and above the rail and did not match carriage roof height.Mins of Ev pp. 453–4 (Dugald Drummond) Drummond did not think the carriages had left the rails until after the girders began to fall, nor had he ever known a carriage (light or heavy) to be blown over by the wind.Mins of Ev p. 459 (Dugald Drummond) =Findings= The three members of the court failed to agree a report although there was much common ground:Report of Court of Inquiry pp. 15–16, unless referenced otherwise Contributory factors * neither the foundations nor the girders were at fault * the quality of the wrought iron, whilst not of the best, was not a factor *the cast iron was also fairly good, but presented difficulty in casting * the workmanship and fitting of the piers were inferior in many respects *the cross bracing of the piers and its fastenings were too weak to resist heavy gales. Rothery complained that the cross-bracing was not as substantial or as well-fitted as on the Belah viaduct;Report of Mr Rothery pp. 43–4 Yolland and Barlow stated that the weight/cost of cross-bracing was a disproportionately small fraction of the total weight/cost of ironworkReport of Court of Inquiry p. 13 * there was insufficiently strict supervision of the Wormit foundry (a great apparent reduction of strength in the cast iron was attributable to the fastenings bringing the stress on the edges of the lugs, rather than acting fairly on them) *supervision of the bridge after completion was unsatisfactory; Noble had no experience of ironwork nor any definite instruction to report on the ironwork *nonetheless Noble should have reported the loose ties. Using packing pieces might have fixed the piers in a distorted form. *the limit had not been enforced, and frequently exceeded. Rothery added that, given the importance to the bridge design of the test borings showing shallow bedrock, Bouch should have taken greater pains, and looked at the cores himself.Report of Mr Rothery pp. 41 \\"True Cause of the Fall of The Bridge\\" According to Yolland and Barlow \\"the fall of the bridge was occasioned by the insufficiency of the cross-bracings and fastenings to sustain the force of the gale on the night of December 28th 1879 ... the bridge had been previously strained by other gales\\".Report of Court of Inquiry pp. 15–16 Rothery agreed, asking \\"Can there be any doubt that what caused the overthrow of the bridge was the pressure of the wind acting upon a structure badly built and badly maintained?\\" =Substantive differences between reports= Yolland and Barlow also noted the possibility that failure was by fracture of a leeward column. Rothery felt that previous straining was \\"partly by previous gales, partly by the great speed at which trains going north were permitted to run through the high girders\\": if the momentum of a train at hitting girders could cause the fall of the bridge, what must have been the cumulative effect of the repeated braking of trains from at the north end of the bridge?Report of Mr Rothery p. 40 He therefore concluded – with (he claimed) the support of circumstantial evidence – that the bridge might well have failed at the north end first;Report of Mr Rothery p. 30 he explicitly dismissed the claim that the train had hit the girders before the bridge fell. Yolland and Barlow concluded that the bridge had failed at the south end first; and made no explicit finding as to whether the train had hit the girders. They noted instead that apart from Bouch himself, Bouch's witnesses claimed/conceded that the bridge failure was due to a shock loading on lugs heavily stressed by windloading.Report of the Court of Inquiry p. 15 Their report is therefore consistent with either a view that the train had not hit the girder or one that a bridge with cross-bracing giving an adequate safety margin against windloading would have survived a train hitting the girder. Yolland and Barlow noted \\"there is no requirement issued by the Board of Trade respecting wind pressure, and there does not appear to be any understood rule in the engineering profession regarding wind pressure in railway structures; and we therefore recommend the Board of Trade should take such steps as may be necessary for the establishment of rules for that purpose.\\"Report of the Court of Inquiry p. 16 Rothery dissented, feeling that it was for the engineers themselves to arrive at an 'understood rule', such as the French rule of or the US .Report of Mr Rothery p. 49 Presentational differences between reports Rothery's minority report is more detailed in its analysis, more willing to blame named individuals, and more quotable, but the official report of the court is a relatively short one signed by Yolland and Barlow. Rothery said that his colleagues had declined to join him in allocating blame, on the grounds that this was outside their terms of reference. However, previous Section 7 inquiries had clearly felt themselves free to blame (Thorpe rail accident) or exculpate (Shipton-on-Cherwell train crash) identifiable individuals as they saw fit, and when Bouch's solicitor checked with Yolland and Barlow, they denied that they agreed with Rothery that \\"For these defects both in the design, the construction, and the maintenance, Sir Thomas Bouch is, in our opinion, mainly to blame.\\"\\"Responsibility for the Accident\\": Rothery (1880: 44) Aftermath =Section 7 inquiries= No further judicial enquiries under Section 7 of the Regulation of Railways Act 1871 were held until the Hixon rail crash in 1968 brought into question both the policy of the Railway Inspectorate towards automated level crossings and the management by the Ministry of Transport (the Inspectorate's parent government department) of the movement of abnormal loads. A Section 7 judicial enquiry was felt necessary to give the required degree of independence. The structure and terms of reference were better defined than for the Tay Bridge inquiry. Brian Gibbens, QC, was supported by two expert assessors, and made findings as to blame/responsibility but not as to liability/culpability. =Wind Pressure (Railway Structures) Commission= The Board of Trade set up a 5-man commission (Barlow, Yolland, Sir John Hawkshaw, Sir William Armstrong and Stokes) to consider what wind loading should be assumed when designing railway bridges. Windspeeds were normally measured in 'miles run in hour' (i.e. windspeed averaged over one hour) so it was difficult to apply Smeaton's table which linked wind pressure to current windspeed :P_t = 0.005 (V_t)^2\\\\, where: :P_tis the instantaneous wind pressure (pounds per square foot) :V_tis the instantaneous air velocity in miles per hour By examination of recorded pressures and windspeeds at Bidston Observatory, the commission found that for high winds the highest wind pressure could be represented very fairly, by :P_m = 0.01 (V_h)^2\\\\, where: :P_mis the maximum instantaneous wind pressure experienced (pounds per square foot) :V_his the 'miles run in hour' (one hour average windspeed) in miles per hour However, they recommended that structures should be designed to withstand a wind loading of , with a safety factor of 4 (2 where only gravity was relied upon). They noted that higher wind pressures had been recorded at Bidston Observatory but these would still give loadings well within the recommended safety margins. The wind pressures reported at Bidston were probably anomalously high because of peculiarities of the site (one of the highest points on the Wirral.): a wind pressure of would overturn railway carriages and such events were a rarity. (To give a subsequent, well documented example, in 1903 a stationary train was overturned on the Levens viaduct but this was by a 'terrific gale' measured at Barrow in Furness to have an average velocity of , estimated to be gusting up to .) =Bridges= A new double-track Tay Bridge was built by the NBR, designed by Barlow and built by William Arrol & Co. of Glasgow upstream of, and parallel to, the original bridge. Work started 6 July 1883 and the bridge opened on 13 July 1887. Sir John Fowler and Sir Benjamin Baker designed the Forth Rail Bridge, built (also by Arrols) between 1883 and 1890. Baker and his colleague Allan Stewart received the major credit for design and overseeing building work. The Forth Bridge had a 40 mph speed limit, which was not well observed.p29 J Thomas op cit Bouch had also been engineer for the North British, Arbroath and Montrose Railway, which included an iron viaduct over the South Esk. Examined closely after the Tay bridge collapse, the viaduct as built did not match the design, and many of the piers were noticeably out of the perpendicular. It was suspected that the construction had not been adequately supervised: foundation piles had not been driven deeply or firmly enough. Tests in 1880 over a period of 36 hours using both dead and rolling loads led to the structure becoming seriously distorted and eight of the piers were declared unsafe. Condemning the structure, Colonel Yolland also stated his opinion that \\"piers constructed of cast-iron columns of the dimensions used in this viaduct should not in future be sanctioned by the Board of Trade.\\" It had to be dismantled and rebuilt by Sir William Arrol to a design by W. R. Galbraith before the line could be opened to traffic in 1881. Bouch's Redheugh Bridge built 1871 was condemned in 1896, the structural engineer doing so saying later that the bridge would have blown over if it had ever seen windloadings of . =Reminders= The current bridge at dusk, with the masonry of one of Bouch's piers silhouetted against the sunlit Tay. thumb The locomotive, NBR no. 224, a 4-4-0 designed by Thomas Wheatley and built at Cowlairs Works in 1871, was salvaged and repaired, remaining in service until 1919, nicknamed \\"The Diver\\"; many superstitious drivers were reluctant to take it over the new bridge. The stumps of the original bridge piers are still visible above the surface of the Tay. Memorials have been placed at either end of the bridge in Dundee and Wormit. A column from the bridge is on display at the Dundee Museum of Transport. On 28 December 2019, Dundee Walterfronts Walks hosted a remembrance walk to mark the 140 year anniversary of the Tay Bridge Disaster. Modern reinterpretations Various additional pieces of evidence have been advanced in the last 40 years, leading to \\"forensic engineering\\" reinterpretations of what actually happened. Works of literature about the disaster The disaster inspired several songs and poems, most famously William McGonagall's \\"The Tay Bridge Disaster\\", widely considered to be of such a low quality as to be comical. The German poet Theodor Fontane, shocked by the news, wrote his poem Die Brück' am Tay.Edward C.

The game allows the player to control an NFL team and become the greatest coach in NFL history. It features then-Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher on the cover. Gameplay The concept behind the game puts the player in the position of a head coach for a National Football League franchise, similar to FIFA Manager where the player takes control of the head coach of a football team. The player will make roster moves, create playbooks, and hire and fire assistant coaches. Success is measured by wins, playoff success, how well the player does in the NFL Draft, and the careers of assistant coaches. The game also has ESPN integration, such as Mel Kiper, Jr. hosting the NFL Draft, Trey Wingo for the game's first few cutscenes and cutscenes featuring Steve Sabol as the player move through the ranks as a head coach. Plot The game begins the week after Super Bowl XL when the Pittsburgh Steelers pull off a 21–10 victory over the Seattle Seahawks. The coach that the player is about to take control of was formerly the offensive/defensive coordinator for the Steelers and is now ready to move up to take the reins of an entire team. First, the player selects a team and then proceeds to the job interview. The coach overall will range from 50 to around 80 at the end of the interview. Depending on how well the interview goes, the player will receive up to five offers from five teams though there are eight teams that are likely to send the player an offer although the player can pick any team they wish. The player selects a team and then signs a contract with them. In addition to being the head coach, the player is also the general manager of the team. On the first day, the player will meet the team owner. Aside from meeting the team owner, the player also meets the other coaches with whom he will work. Daily activities, depending on the time of the season, include hiring and firing coaches, calling players' agents, checking e-mail, identifying players to scout at the NFL Scouting Combine, gameplanning for the next game, and running practice. During the game, the player can motivate and discuss strategy with the team, which can affect the motivated player's reception. The career is 30 years long from 2006 to 2036. Teams and stadiums The game consists of all 32 teams from the 2005 NFL season with all 31 stadiums. Unlike NFL Head Coach 09, however, Aloha Stadium is not in NFL Head Coach. Reception The game received positive reviews. IGN gave the game a 7.2/10, praising the NFL Films score, though commenting about the Madden engine being \\"not as pretty as other football games\\". On the contrary, GameSpot praised the engine, though criticizing the multiplayer; GameSpot also graded the game as 7.2/10. CNET scored the game 3.5/5 stars, also praising the NFL Films score, though commenting that the on- field action is blander than usual due to the lack of in-game announcers, along with some occasions when players are negatively motivated after positive motivation. Sequel On February 26, 2008, EA Sports announced the sequel to NFL Head Coach entitled NFL Head Coach 09. It was released on August 12, 2008 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.

Biography Lilli Carati was born in Varese (Lombardy). In 1974, she was named \\"Miss Elegance\\" at a beauty contest in Calabria and began working as a fashion model in Milan. She was first runner-up at Miss Italia contest of 1975 and moved on to cinema. Most of her box office hits were in the genre of \\"sex comedy,\\" but she also appeared in films of different genres such as Squadra antifurto (1977, a crime story with Tomas Milian), Le evase – Storie di sesso e di violenze (1978, a prototypical exploitation film), and La fine del mondo nel nostro solito letto in una notte piena di pioggia (1978, a film by Lina Wertmüller). She also appeared in nude photos on the pages of Italian men's magazines like Playmen and Albo Blitz. Around 1990, she retired from public life. On 20 October 2014, she died of a brain tumour.Addio a Lilli Carati, icona dei film sexy anni 70 Films The first film she played the lead role was 1976 La professoressa di scienze naturali (\\"School Days\\") by Michele Massimo Tarantini. In this film, Carati plays a substitute teacher of natural science named Stefania Marini who soon gets one of her students, Andrea (Marco Gelardini), as her lover and a physician Baron Cacciapuopolo (Michele Gammino) as an admirer. In the end, she marries the Baron but keeps Andrea as a lover. Her next \\"school film\\" was La compagna di banco by Mariano Laurenti in 1977. In this film, Carati is a rich schoolgirl and a basketball player named Simona Girardi with a lover named Mario (Antonio Melidoni). Alvaro Vitali, a regular of school films, is present in both films as the main comic character. The same year she played Paola in the poliziotteschi film Gangbuster, opposite Ray Lovelock and Mel Ferrer. In 1978, in Candido Erotico (Copenhagen Nights) by Claudio de Molinis, she plays Charlotte, a young student who is drawn into confusion when she falls in love with her stepmother's lover, Carlo (Mircha Carven) who works as an actor in sex shows. Eventually, she discovers the ménage à trois involving her father, stepmother, and Carlo and decides to carry on with her relationship. Her greatest success came with Avere vent'anni (\\"To Be Twenty\\") by Fernando Di Leo in 1978. The film, about the story of two girls who leave home and move into a hippie commune in pursuit of freedom but end up in the hands of thugs to be violently murdered, later attained a cult status as expressed by its screening at Venice Film Festival in 2004. In this film, the side-kick to Carati (Tina) was Gloria Guida (Lia), a popular star of the 1970s. The film also contains a brief lesbian sex scene with the two actresses. In Il corpo della ragassa (1979) by Pasquale Festa Campanile, Carati plays Teresa Aguzzi, a naïve-looking but cunning country girl involved in a Pygmalion story set in 1950s Italy. The same year she appeared in Senza buccia (Skin Deep) by Marcello Aliprandi, a story of love relationships at a holiday hideout. In There Is a Ghost in My Bed (1980), an Italo-Spanish production by Claudio de Molinis, she played newlywed Adelaide Fumagalli who arrives at the \\"Black Castle\\" in England with her husband on honeymoon. The castle is home to the ghost of 17th century nobleman Sir Archibald, played by veteran actor Renzo Montagnani who played Teresa's father in Il corpo della ragassa. Sir Archibald plays his games to seduce Adelaide which will eventually end badly for himself. Il marito in vacanza (1981) by Alessandro Lucidi and Mario Lucidi would again bring Carati and Montagnani together. This time Montagnani is a professor who tries to seduce Lucia Coradini (Carati), a beautiful colleague. In 1984, Carati met director Joe d'Amato through her actress friend Jenny Tamburi and played in four D'Amato films, among which are L'alcova (The Alcove, 1984) and Il piacere (The Pleasure, 1985), both set in 1930s Italy and with Laura Gemser. In 1987 and 1988, she appeared in a number of adult films by Giorgio Grand, along with a team of performers including Rocco Siffredi. In 1989, she was in The Whore by Alex de Renzy and Henri Pachard. This film had the most elaborate plot among her porn films but she didn't play the lead role. The last appearance of Lilli Carati was in the role of an occultist in Violent Shit - The Movie (2015) by Luigi Pastore.Violent Shit – The Movie Review The film is a remake of Violent Shit by Andreas Schnaas.

Falco and Petronius sneak out for a drink in a nearby street next to a fountain, which is not working. When a worker turns up to clean it, it is revealed that a severed hand had blocked the aqueduct. Falco and Petro start to investigate, but their case is stolen by Anacrites. Petro puts up a sign proclaiming that awards are to be given on the discovery of any body parts. Falco talks to his brother-in- law and is told that severed body parts have been discovered in the rivers and aqueducts for several years, usually after festivals. When he's told that Petro put up the sign he runs back to his old apartment (where Petro now lives after being kicked out by his wife) as a slave hands over a new hand to Petro. Petro takes down the sign. Anacrites, who is rather annoyed at being muscled out of his stolen case, sends four men to beat up Falco and Petro. They defeat the bruisers easily and trail them back to Anacrites. Soon afterwards, Julius Frontinus finds and gives over a new hand. It looks the same as the other hands but this one has a wedding ring with two names inscribed (Asinia and Caius). They track down Caius Cicurrus, the widower of Asinia. He is innocent and is greatly grieving for his lost wife. Petro's wife dumped him after he took up with Balbina Milvia from Time to Depart. Milvia's husband Florius sends men to beat up Falco and Petro. Falco, with the help of his trainer Glaucus and Glaucus's trainees, beats off his attackers but Petro has no such help and is heavily injured. Milvia comes to Falco asking him to help her, as she fears that her mother, who has vanished, has been taken by the killer. Falco finds Cornella Flaccida at a new apartment. He goes out to the country but finds no suspects. After continuous reconnaissance he has two problems: First, Claudia Rufina, the heiress from A Dying Light In Corduba and the new fiancee to Helena's brother Aelianus, has vanished, and second, a slave called Thurius has been identified as the murderer. Falco goes out to rescue Claudia and apprehend Thurius. He captures Thurius and finds his lair and his victim. He finds that it's not Claudia, it's Milvia's mother, who vanished again. Unlike Claudia, however, no one liked her enough to send out a search party. Claudia is later found to have eloped with Helena's other brother Justinus, an act that has disastrous consequences. The book ends with Falco telling Petro his wife went out with another man, and later receiving a visit from Anacrites.

Career Wigley received both his Bachelor of Architecture (1979) and Ph.D. (1987) from the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Mike Austin was his doctoral supervisor. Wigley left Auckland in 1986 and taught at Princeton University, from 1987 to 1999, serving also as the director of Graduate Studies at Princeton’s School of Architecture. In 1988, Wigley co-curated with Philip Johnson the MoMA exhibition Deconstructivist Architecture. The exhibition featured the works of seven architects, who were already well-known at the time for a style of architecture that involved in various ways \\"deconstructing\\" conventional notions of architectural convention: Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid, Peter Eisenman, Daniel Libeskind, Bernard Tschumi, Rem Koolhaas and Coop Himmelb(l)au. The curators linked the works to the philosophical notion of Deconstruction, as espoused by French philosopher Jacques Derrida, as well as the art-architectural historical precedent of Russian constructivism, and several works from this period were displayed in the exhibition. However, of the architects only Eisenman and Tschumi acknowledged the connection to Derrida and only Hadid and Koolhaas to Constructivism.  Personal life  Mark Wigley is married to architectural historian Beatriz Colomina. Volume Magazine In 2005, Wigley founded Volume Magazine together with Rem Koolhaas and Ole Bouman. A collaborative project by Archis (Amsterdam), AMO Rotterdam and C-lab (Columbia University NY), Volume Magazine is an experimental think tank focusing on the process of spatial and cultural reflexivity. The magazine aims to explore \\"beyond architecture’s definition of 'making buildings'\\" by presenting global views on architecture and design, broader attitudes to social structures and created environments; and embodies progressive journalism. Created and founded in collaboration with Brett Steele the Institute of Failure; essentially an academic institution for the instruction and theory of failure (as opposed to success). Awards Wigley was awarded the Resident Fellowship, Chicago Institute for Architecture and Urbanism, 1989; International Committee of Architectural Critics (C.I.C.A.) Triennial Award for Architectural Criticism, 1990; and the Graham Foundation Grant, 1997.

The television series Farscape features an extensive cast of characters created by Rockne S. O'Bannon. The series is set aboard a living spacecraft named Moya of the Leviathan race. The physical, racial and species-specific cultural characteristics, as well as underlying mythological/sociological similarities' and differences of the alien races portrayed in Farscape were conceptualised and created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Main characters =John Crichton= John Robert Crichton, Jr. , played by Ben Browder, is an International Aeronautics and Space Administration (most commonly referred to on the show as IASA) astronaut who, in the opening few minutes of the pilot episode, is accidentally catapulted through a wormhole across the universe, thus; setting the scene for the show as a whole. As the only regularly appearing human on the show, he is the main focus and is the main character as he narrates the weekly credits and is the only character to appear in every episode. Along with Michael Shanks' character of Daniel Jackson in Stargate SG-1, Browder's Crichton has been called one of the sexiest male characters in science fiction. Although Crichton is a heroic and unwaveringly loyal character, he is also a mischievously comical one, so much so that he is the primary source of humor for the series. The show derives much of its humor from Crichton's habitual (and extensive) use of Earth-related pop culture references, often used as witty mockery in the face of danger or opponents who, being unfamiliar with the references, are unaware that they are being insulted. Although an occasional reference will provoke curiosity or confusion to his friends, Crichton's fellow shipmates are largely unaffected by these comments because they simply assume them to be native Earth terms that cannot be interpreted by translator microbes and merely extrapolate the meaning from its context. Information about John Crichton's life before the first episode is only revealed slowly over the course of the series. He was the middle child born to Jack (an astronaut) and Leslie Crichton. He has two sisters, Olivia (his younger sister) and an older sister, Susan. He has a childhood friend named Douglas \\"D.K.\\" Knox. John's mother died of cancer four years before his Farscape One accident. John Crichton followed in his father's footsteps by becoming an astronaut, flew on two missions prior to the Farscape incident and was Mission Commander on one of those missions. In the first episode of season one, during a test flight designed to prove a scientific theory concerning the use of planetary gravity as a means for spaceship acceleration, a wormhole appears, and John and his \\"Farscape One\\" module are pulled into and through it. On his exit from the wormhole, he finds himself in the middle of a spaceship dogfight, during which he accidentally causes the death of Tauvo Crais, the brother of Peacekeeper captain Bialar Crais. Crichton's craft is pulled aboard a large spaceship named Moya, a Leviathan (a biomechanoid, i.e., a \\"living ship\\") where John meets his first aliens (Zhaan, D'Argo, Aeryn Sun and Rygel). Shortly after, John meets Bialar Crais, who wants revenge for his brother's death. John has to adapt quickly to a life with aliens, guns, and space travel, without the comfort of Earth culture. Toward the end of season one, Crichton encounters a mysterious alien race known only as The Ancients, who hide a repository of wormhole knowledge into his brain to guide him home, beginning a series-long chase by a Sebacean-Scarran hybrid Peacekeeper called Scorpius who hunts John and the rest of the Farscape crew to obtain that information. Early in season two, Crichton learns that Scorpius has implanted a neural chip into his head, which causes hallucinations of a \\"neural clone\\" of Scorpius, whom he dubs \\"Harvey\\". These hallucinations influence Crichton in an effort to get at the hidden wormhole knowledge. As a result, Crichton's behavior grows more erratic and unpredictable, even as he continues to have romantic feelings for Aeryn Sun. In the end of Season 2, the neural chip takes complete control over Crichton (resulting in a Scorpius/Crichton mixed personality with extremely dark humor) and transmits a message to Scorpius. Shortly after that Harvey defeats Aeryn in an aerial dogfight and seemingly kills her. After Aeryn's death, Crichton regains control. The chip is removed, but stolen by Scorpius. With the beginning of Season three, Harvey still remains in Crichton's head and Aeryn has been revived by Zhaan, who consequently dies a few episodes later. Sometime thereafter Crichton is \\"twinned\\" by another alien; neither of the Crichtons can be called a copy, but are \\"equal and original\\" (and each has his own \\"Harvey\\") eventually, the crew of Moya is split across the two Leviathans, Moya and Talyn and they are subsequently separated from each other; each ship has one Crichton. The Crichton aboard Talyn begins a romantic relationship with Aeryn while the Crichton on Moya continues studying wormholes, helped by the repository in his brain. Jack the Ancient finds the Talyn Crichton, forcibly extracts Harvey and unlocks the wormhole knowledge, but this Crichton later dies of radiation poisoning from a wormhole weapon. When the survivors of the two crews are reunited, Aeryn (in her grief) is very cold to the remaining Crichton, due to him having different memories about the last few months; the crew members of Moya start going their separate ways at the end of season three. Just after Aeryn Sun leaves Crichton, seemingly for good, he learns that she is pregnant with his child (whether the child belongs to the Moya Crichton or the Talyn Crichton is left unknown). Early season four leaves Crichton with nothing but time to work on his wormhole theories. He eventually reunites with the crew members of Moya, and Aeryn and Scorpius, who has fallen out of favor with Peacekeeper high command. Shortly, after arrival, Scorpius offers to remove Harvey. Due to the neural clone's longer presence within and increased familiarity with Crichton, Harvey's reaction includes persuasion and appeal to sympathy rather than threats. Crichton still agrees to allow Scorpius to remove the lingering neural spillover. Halfway through the season, Crichton finds his way back to Earth, but he voluntarily gives up the dream of Earth and returns to Moya. After a series of dangerous events (including Harvey's resurrection) Crichton and Aeryn find time alone together. Aeryn tells him he is the father of her child and Crichton proposes to her. The moment she accepts, an alien craft melts the two and ends the season. Crichton and Aeryn are revived at the beginning of Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars mini-series, and Crichton uses his wormhole knowledge to successfully force a peace treaty between the warring Peacekeepers and Scarrans. The wormhole knowledge in his brain is finally removed by Einstein the Ancient. During the mini-series, Aeryn gives birth to their son, named D'Argo Sun-Crichton in honor of their late comrade. =Aeryn Sun= Aeryn Sun , played by Claudia Black, is a former Peacekeeper pilot and officer. Although she appears to be human, she is in fact Sebacean, a species indistinguishable from humans in external appearance. At the time John Crichton appears through a wormhole in the beginning of the series, Officer Aeryn Sun is in her Prowler battling to retake the Leviathan Moya, which has been seized by escaping prisoners Ka D'Argo, Rygel, and Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan. However, Aeryn's prowler is caught up in the stream of Moya's starburst and is towed along with the escaping Leviathan. Aeryn is brought on board Moya as a prisoner, but when she and Crichton encounter her commanding officer Captain Crais, she defends John from Crais' allegation that John deliberately attacked and killed Crais' brother, saying he is not brave enough or smart enough to have done so. In return, Crais declares her to be \\"irreversibly contaminated\\" from spending too much time with an unknown life form, which means a death sentence. John Crichton and D'Argo soon escape the Peacekeepers again and, having nowhere else to go, Aeryn reluctantly becomes a fugitive alongside them. Aboard Moya, she learns to think beyond the strict, militaristic confines of her Peacekeeper upbringing. Born in service aboard a Command Carrier, it is the only life she has known and thus; is very well skilled in hand-to-hand and weapons combat. She also becomes a valuable and important member of Moya's crew, and a companion and romantic interest to Crichton during the series. It is only after leaving the Peacekeepers that she can begin to find out about her parentage. She has discovered that her mother, Xhalax Sun, was a Peacekeeper pilot who - against Peacekeeper regulations - fell in love with an older officer, Talyn Lyczac. They deliberately had Aeryn, a child born of love and Xhalax sneaks into Aeryn's dormitory one night to tell her so, which is strictly against regulations. To redeem her crime, Xhalax was forced by the Peacekeepers to choose between the two, and she executed Talyn so that Aeryn could live. Aeryn evolves from a cold, detached soldier into a valuable friend and crewmate. Her relationship with John Crichton also evolves, and Aeryn ultimately becomes a compassionate wife and loving mother at the end of the show. They name their son D'Argo Sun-Crichton, after their dear friend who seemingly lost his life in the Peacekeeper Wars. =Ka D'Argo= Ka D'Argo (called simply D'Argo), played by Anthony Simcoe, is a Luxan warrior who was imprisoned aboard the Leviathan Moya by the Peacekeepers after being convicted (falsely) of killing his Sebacean wife Lo'Laan in a fit of Luxan Hyper-Rage. During his time as a prisoner, the Peacekeepers shackled D'Argo in his cell with heavy chains attached to a pair of metal hooks surgically implanted around his collarbones to keep him under control despite his strength. He later escaped (along with Rygel and Zhaan). As a Luxan warrior, D'Argo carries a weapon known as a Qualta Blade, a heavy broadsword that can transform into a Qualta Rifle. His personality in Season 1 was paranoid and ill-tempered against his friends (in the fourth episode, D'Argo puts on a Tavlek gauntlet that injects a stimulant so \\"stimulating\\" his personality that D'Argo attempted to take command of Moya and kill all those who stand against him). He has a powerful, fast tongue that he can use to attack in a manner similar to that of a frog or chameleon. The tip can inject an \\"adaptive\\" venom which renders the target unconscious without killing them. Throughout the first half of the series, D'Argo's consuming desire was to find Jothee, his son by Lo'Laan. After Jothee was found, his plans to settle down with his son and Chiana scared the Nebari girl, resulting in her betraying him. D'Argo and Jothee part on bad terms in \\"Suns and Lovers\\", but they are later reunited and somewhat reconciled in the miniseries. After being mortally wounded in The Peacekeeper Wars, D'Argo covers the escape of his comrades off Qujaga, which was then destroyed by Crichton's wormhole weapon. John Crichton and Aeryn Sun then name their son, born during the battle, D'Argo, in his memory. The episode \\"Unrealized Reality\\" features a character from another universe who is a composite of D'Argo and Rygel. The character appeared in other media. In Horizons, a story by creator Rockne S O'Bannon that takes place far in the future, and that was written before Peacekeeper War, D'Argo is still alive. However, he did lose his arm, which is now a clear prosthetic. D'Argo was also parodied by the character Teal'c in the Stargate SG-1 episode \\"200.\\" =Zhaan= Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan, played by Virginia Hey, is a Delvian, a blue, spiritual, humanoid plant species, and a Pa'u (priestess) in their religious order. Zhaan was imprisoned aboard Moya for the assassination of the leader of the Delvian government and her lover, Bitaal. Bitaal refused to step down as leader of the Delvian people when his tenure was over. He, along with other conservative Pa'us, hired the Peacekeepers for \\"external security.\\" There was a political crackdown and it is implied that some atrocities occurred under Bitaal's rule. Zhaan, while in Unity (an erotic, if not entirely sexual, activity unique to Delvians) with Bitaal, killed him and drove herself insane in the process. It is unclear whether Zhaan was a member of a terrorist group or whether she acted alone. It is clear, however, that Zhaan was courted by a violent revolutionary organization of Pa'us on a planet they encountered in the Uncharted Territories. She has also been an anarchist, and like other trained Delvians, Zhaan has several empathic and telepathic abilities which she cultivated to Pa'u level during her time in prison on Moya, although she was forced to channel these abilities to cause harm during the crew's first confrontation with the powerful Maldis in order to stop him and save the currently-imprisoned Crichton. She is also skilled in medicine and other related sciences. During her time aboard Moya, she is often seen making drugs and explosives in her workshop to assist her shipmates. As a Pa'u, Zhaan's spiritual abilities significantly improve upon achieving a new level. When first introduced, Zhaan is a level nine Pa'u, with the ability to lessen the pain of others by taking some portion of it into herself. Later in the series with Crichton's help, she gains a level, becoming a level ten Pa'u and gaining the ability to protect others from psychic attack with her own mind. In the episode \\"Bone to Be Wild\\" she shows that for short periods of time she can make herself invisible, although it is not stated whether or not this is only possible when surrounded by foliage. Towards the beginning of the third season, Zhaan saved the seemingly dead Aeryn Sun, and in the process became critically ill herself. While the crew are searching for a planet with the right conditions for Zhaan to heal, John Crichton diverts Moya to investigate a wormhole instead, where the Leviathan collides with another spacecraft. In order to save Moya and her crew, Zhaan sacrifices herself by piloting the other craft away before it is destroyed. In real life, Virginia Hey left the show because of health problems related to the extensive makeup and demanding work schedule. She still reappeared as Zhaan in two fourth- season episodes, \\"John Quixote\\" and \\"Unrealized Reality\\"; series director Rowan Woods also made an on-screen appearance as a male virtual reality incarnation in \\"John Quixote\\", and Zhaan appears in archive footage in The Peacekeeper Wars. Hey's voice was used in the Aeryn-focused episode \\"The Choice\\", the seventeenth episode of the third season. =Rygel= Dominar Rygel XVI (called simply Rygel) was once the royal ruler of the Hynerian Empire. He is known for being selfish and collects anything valuable and was one of two regular puppet characters on the show. Rygel was operated by John Eccleston, Sean Masterson, Tim Mieville, Matt McCoy, Mario Halouvas and Fiona Gentle. His voice was provided by Jonathan Hardy. Rygel has a long history. After ruling for an unknown number of years as Dominar of the Hynerians, he was overthrown by his cousin Bishan. After the overthrow, which occurred over 130 cycles (years) before the events of Farscape, he became a prisoner of the Peacekeepers. During this time, he was imprisoned in several places and tortured, most notably by Selto Durka, captain of the near-legendary ship, the Zelbinion, and was eventually transferred to Moya. Due to his size and cunning, he is able not only to leave his cell at will, but also to organize and carry out a revolt among the other prisoners placed on Moya, allowing them to escape Peacekeeper control. After the escape (i.e., during the series), Rygel is shown to be cunning and resourceful but also focused almost entirely on his own personal goals and wealth. As time goes on, his egocentric attitude becomes less prevalent and he warms to his role as a member of Moya's crew. A recurring gag in Farscape involves him flatulating helium when he gets nervous, causing everyone's voices to have a higher pitch by the offensive gas. At the end of the series, Bishan pleads with him to return to help reunite their people and Rygel departs to do so with a devastated Chiana. A parody of him was in the Stargate SG-1 episode \\"200\\" as an Asgard with a Fu- Manchu beard and mustache; his only line was the Hynerian curse \\"Yotz\\", similar in use and meaning as the earth curse \\"Hell\\". =Chiana= Chiana, played by Gigi Edgley, is a street-smart, savvy, and mercurial character who is willing to scam or steal for an adventure and risk her life for the people she loves. Chiana is a Nebari, a grey-skinned race whose society is heavily regimented by the government (known as The Establishment). The Establishment venerates control and order, pitting Chiana's independent ways in a society all about conformity against the Nebari's ideal about \\"the greater good\\" and making her a target for government reprogramming (called \\"cleansing\\"). In her premiere episode during the middle of season 1, \\"Durka Returns\\", she successfully escapes from Nebari custody, and ends up a passenger on Moya with the rest of the crew. Many episodes have demonstrated that she is a skilled fighter and is agile and acrobatic. She has a number of distinctive mannerisms such as cocking her head at times and crouching on objects rather than sitting or standing. Other Nebari do not exhibit the same style of physical movement, though her fluid movements and frequent situational appraisals suggest a lifetime of avoiding danger. One of Chiana's other characteristic traits is her strong sense of individuality. She respects no authority and values her freedom more than anything or anyone else. This gives her the appearance of being promiscuous; she attempted to seduce Jothee, D'Argo's son, the present and past versions of John Crichton as well as others. In Season 2, the writers created a backstory for Chiana, along with a family member. She has one named relative, her brother Nerri, three years her senior. Along with Nerri, she escaped Nebari Prime at a young age, and then the two traveled around for some years. Nerri decided to join the resistance fighting against the Nebari leaders, and split up with Chiana so she would not be endangered by his activities. In the third season of the show, Chiana harbours hopes of meeting up with her brother and joining the resistance to reunite with him. In Season 3, the writers created a scenario in which Chiana developed a new ability. After her encounter with an Energy Rider, Chiana began to experience precognitive visions that left her with blindness and splitting headaches. These visions later evolved into being able to see the present and future in slow motion, and each time she used this ability, the following blindness would last longer than before until she ended up completely blind at the end of season 4. Shortly before the start of Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars, she received new eyes from a Diagnosan that allowed her to 'see' energy sources and, to an extent, see through walls. In the episode, \\"Durka Returns\\", Chiana was a thief so slippery that she evades Moya's internal sensors. She proves to be resourceful in \\"Nerve\\", distracting the Peacekeepers from John, disguising herself as a tech, manipulating Gilina and delivering Talyn. An alternate reality version of Chiana appeared in \\"Unrealized Reality\\" and \\"Prayer\\"; in the latter episode she is killed by Scorpius, an act that disturbs Crichton because, in the alternate reality of those two episodes, she resembles Aeryn (and is played by Claudia Black). =Pilot= Pilot is a member of a race known to viewers simply as Pilots or \\"Servicers\\". He is introduced in the \\"Premiere\\" and plays a significant role in the resolution of The Peacekeeper Wars. Pilot was one of two regular animatronic puppet characters in Farscape. He is operated by Sean Masterson, Tim Mieville, Matt McCoy, Mario Halouvas and Fiona Gentle. His voice is provided by Lani Tupu (who also plays the character Captain Bialar Crais). Moya's pilot is only known by his species's name, which also describes his role on the ship. His real name, if he has one, is unknown. Pilots bond with biomechanical Leviathan spacecraft and become their helmsman, navigator, companion, and liaison to passengers. Once bonded, Pilots can survive only a brief period of time of separation from their Leviathans, and only when travelling in something made of a Leviathan's components (as in a transport pod). In bonding to Leviathans, Pilots sacrifice much of their life- span for the benefits of space travel, since Pilots can live well over a thousand years but Leviathans live only hundreds. The Pilot most commonly seen in the series is Moya's second pilot. The first, a female, was shot and forcibly removed by Peacekeepers when she refused to consent to experiments being done upon Moya. With her death, the more familiar Pilot took her place, seduced by his desire to travel the stars, something that had been denied him by the elders of his race because he was still young and immature. Unwilling to allow the slow gradual bonding of Pilot and Leviathan that is normal, the Peacekeepers forcibly grafted the new Pilot into Moya's systems, an action that allowed him control over the ship but at the cost of continuous pain, until Pilot pulled free from his connections with Moya and re-bonded himself to Moya at the natural speed. The second Pilot carried the guilt of his role in the death of the first for several years. Pilot is effectively immobile in the heart of the ship, but plays a key role in numerous adventures, and the other characters come to rely upon him as a figure of wisdom and comfort. Early in the series he is attacked and mutilated by members of the crew, as a local scientist wanted Pilot flesh in return for giving them maps to their homes. Despite this, he did not hold a grudge as he considered serving the others, whatever their needs, to simply be his role. He was most happy when helping other crew members, although as his independence grew, he could sometimes become irritated with them and would order them out of his chamber and even off the ship altogether. In the series finale, Pilot experienced a conflict with Moya where he wanted to help Crichton destroy the wormhole linking Earth to Tormented Space and Moya did not want him to. Despite this and initially stating he could do nothing, Pilot joined the mission, leaving Moya for the first time in a long time to aid Crichton's plan. Though Pilot was left weakened by his separation from Moya, he succeeded in destroying the wormhole and saving Earth, inadvertently killing the crew of a Scarren Stryker in the process. He was later rebonded with Moya. Other Pilot characters seen briefly in the series include that of the damaged and mutilated Leviathan named Rovhu, whose limbs were repeatedly eaten and regrown by carnivorous prisoners, and the ancient Pilot of Elack, who housed Crichton when he was separated from Moya and sacrificed her quiet death in the Leviathan's Burial Ground to help Crichton escape from the Peacekeepers. Moya's child Talyn did not need a Pilot by Peacekeeper design, but nevertheless could support one. =Scorpius= Scorpius, played by Wayne Pygram, is the half-Sebacean, half- Scarran Peacekeeper, and the primary antagonist of the series, relentlessly pursuing John Crichton for the secrets of wormhole technology locked in John Crichton's unconscious mind to create a wormhole weapon. He is the product of an experiment by the Scarrans – his Sebacean mother was raped by a Scarran to see if there would be any benefit in a hybrid. Raised by Scarrans, he has come to hate them, to reject his Scarran side, and to live for revenge against them. His physical attributes and his character traits are influenced by his race. Scorpius first appeared in \\"Nerve\\" and made his last appearance in \\"The Peacekeeper Wars Part 2\\". Being half Scarran, Scorpius's body produces an extreme amount of body heat, particularly when angry. However, being also half-Sebacean means that too much heat will kill him. To prevent this he wears a full-body cooling suit notable mostly for the interchangeable cooling rods inside his cranium that absorb his excess body heat. He can see temperature gradients, especially of the face, allowing him to tell when people are lying, as described in the episode \\"Incubator\\". As a result, John Crichton was forced to enlist the use of herbal drugs to mask his love for Aeryn Sun for fear that he may use that knowledge against them to further his agenda. Scorpius prides himself on his patience and his intellect. Scorpius is willing to do absolutely anything to achieve his goals, which he is very honest about when it suits him. He will (and does over the course of the series) lie, kill in cold blood, order the deaths of multitudes, torture innocents, and sacrifice those close to him to get what he wants. He is also willing to aid his enemies or humiliate himself if it will further his goals. He has returned from supposedly fatal situations more than once, which he credits to his \\"foresight and preparation\\". He manipulates others to do his work but does much on his own; his obsession with Crichton and his wormhole secrets is proof of that. He is highly educated and extremely intelligent, and exercises remarkable ingenuity. Only he knows how deep his schemes run and, while he claims his main desire is to eliminate the Scarran threat, protagonist John Crichton is loath to ever trust him. His rank is never mentioned, and it is assumed that he does not officially hold one. Wayne Pygram seemed to confirm this during an interview on the Farscape DVD set; while Dominar Rygel XVI once claimed that Scorpius was \\"higher even than a captain\\" (\\"I-Yensch, You-Yensch\\"), the claim was made more as a boast in an attempt to inflate Scorpius' value to kidnappers. His authority is not absolute, however, as Commandant Mele-On Grayza informed him when she superseded it. During the series, he is shown to have the authority to command a research base, a command carrier, a fleet of command carriers, and an even larger fleet in Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars. However, the exact Peacekeeper ranks at this level have never been established in the show. Despite being an antagonist for the first three seasons, Scorpius joins the crew of Moya for the final season to protect Crichton after his Command Carrier is destroyed and he is hunted by the Peacekeepers. He becomes a more or less trustworthy crewmember though he looks for any chance to get Crichton's knowledge and forms a relationship with Sikozu. At the end of the series, he returns to the Peacekeepers and in The Peacekeeper Wars, instigates a war between them and the Scarrens. At the end of The Peacekeeper Wars he finally gets what he wants when Crichton uses a wormhole weapon on the Scarrens and Peacekeepers and is horrified, calling it \\"madness\\", finally understanding the danger of what he sought. He is last seen on Moya smiling as the Scarrens and Peacekeepers sign a peace treaty. Harvey Harvey is a neural clone of Scorpius and exists solely in the head of John Crichton. He was also played by Wayne Pygram. Harvey is the result of a neural chip that was placed into Crichton's brain by Scorpius after the Aurora Chair failed to reveal the wormhole information he was after. His name, given to him by Crichton, is taken from either the Mary Chase play Harvey, in which Harvey is an invisible six-foot, one-and-a-half-inch tall rabbit that only Elwood P. Dowd can see, or the popular film versions, both starring Jimmy Stewart (1950; 1972). Harvey first appeared in \\"Crackers Don't Matter\\" and had his last appearance in The Peacekeeper Wars Part 2. Harvey's purpose is threefold: he is to unlock the wormhole knowledge stored somewhere in Crichton's brain, protect Crichton's life until Scorpius manages to retrieve the chip, and prevent Crichton from hurting or killing Scorpius. Harvey also has the ability to stop Crichton's brain functions for a short time, making him appear dead. He can control Crichton's memory and nervous system when the chip is in place, which he uses to hide his presence from Crichton. Eventually, the chip becomes strong enough to completely dominate Crichton's mind and body. Even after the chip is removed, Harvey is able to exert limited control over Crichton. After Scorpius reprograms him, Harvey has some type of mental link to Scorpius that allows Scorpius to track Crichton down after John is revived from his crystallization by the Eidelons. Harvey contains much of Scorpius' knowledge and intellect. In Season 2, Harvey is discovered. He is basically a menacing hallucination of Scorpius that influences Crichton to become more erratic, unpredictable and similar to Scorpius. He is capable of killing Crichton and does his best to make sure that Crichton would not go against Scorpius's ideas. In the end of Season 2, Harvey dominates Crichton (resulting in a mixed personality with dark humor), murders his love Aeryn Sun (whom the mixed personality also is attracted to) and transmits a message to Scorpius. After that, Crichton regains control, the chip is removed and stolen by Scorpius. In Season 3, Harvey discovers that even though the chip was removed, he has blended with Crichton's subconscious and is trapped there forever without any of his previous powers. He attempts to manipulate John to commit suicide, but fails. Crichton is rescued and the only thing Harvey can do is give advice. Everything goes \\"fine\\" until John is twinned by a madman, twinning Harvey as well. Black Harvey, who goes to Talyn with his Crichton, advises to John to not trust the Ancient Jack. He also points out that Scorpius did not copy his module, but that it was Furlow who also had the sketchy wormhole data Crichton had in early Season 1. Talyn was quickly taken to Furlow's desert planet, but it was no longer inhabited. Charrids, the collaborators of Scarrans, had overrun Furlow's mechanic lab though. Furlow indeed had made progress and the Scarrans soon got the data. To destroy the Dreadnought, Jack began building a wormhole weapon. To make sure Harvey would not get the unlocked data, Jack decided to destroy him. Harvey angrily opposed, but was \\"mortally wounded\\" nonetheless. In his last minutes, he took control over the unconscious Crichton and attempted to manipulate Aeryn to shoot him, claiming Crichton was dead. He failed and his last words were: \\"A soldier must not be weak. Weakness means defeat.\\" Green Harvey faced death when John Crichton was attacked by Ka D'Argo in Luxan hyper-rage. John's reasons to live (Earth, dad, pizza, sex, cold beer, fast cars, sex, Aeryn, love) were not adequate so Harvey proposed revenge. To discover a reason to live, Crichton created a cartoon reality to oppose an illusory D'Argo. To combat him, Pilot proposed to run from him, Jool proposed to try to talk to him, Chiana proposed to fight him. All failed. Crichton went with Harvey's idea after being clinically dead for a time and it worked. But Crichton's idea, love, worked best. After that, Harvey unlocked Noranti's subliminal message: \\"Aeryn is pregnant\\". Crichton got the message after Aeryn left and at once decided to retrieve her. Unfortunately, after that, Moya was sucked down by a wormhole, leaving Crichton stranded. After Crichton returned to the ship, Scorpius asked for asylum. Harvey suggested killing him. Scorpius proposed to erase Harvey. Since this Harvey had been in Crichton far longer than his twin, Crichton hesitated, but eventually agreed. Harvey was removed. After Crichton and Scorpius had allied and Crichton broke the agreement and left the hybrid to die, Harvey was \\"resurrected\\" and improved to Harvey 2.0. He was loyal to Scorpius and had a connection with him so Scorpius would know he was alive. After Scorpius was rescued thanks to Harvey's lies, a war between Scarrans and Peacekeepers broke out and Crichton finally created the wormhole weapon. Harvey was deleted after his success, since his purpose was finally fulfilled. His last words were: \\"Goodbye John. Thanks... for your memories\\" After the chip was removed, it was discovered by Scorpius that although his neural clone had blended into Crichton, the opposite happened in the chip. A neural clone of John Crichton existed within it. And since there were encryptions to the wormhole data, only he could unlock them. Scorpius showed him his violent past with the Scarrans and did everything to convince him, but the Crichton clone claimed he had already lost everything. After Crichton refused to give him the data he needed, his anger's Scarran heat destroyed the chip and killed him. His last words were: \\"You think that neural clones go to heaven? Well, wherever I wind up, when I see your mama, I'll be sure to give her your regards!\\" According to the show's executive producer David Kemper, the idea for Harvey came from a necessity to have the character of Scorpius more visible during the show. As the show's main villain, he needed to be a constant and viable threat. After seeing a hallucinated Scorpius interact with Crichton in the second season's fourth episode, \\"Crackers Don't Matter\\", they came up with the idea of putting Scorpius inside of John's head. The clone's presence was hinted at in the second and third episodes of the \\"Look at the Princess\\" trilogy as well as in \\"Beware of Dog\\" before his presence was revealed outright to Crichton in the season's 15th episode, \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\". However, this then became an example of dramatic irony, as Crichton's memory of Harvey was erased, until he was revealed again. =Bialar Crais= Bialar Crais, played by Lani Tupu, was the series' original antagonist throughout season 1. The series' creator, Rockne O'Bannon, named the character after his friend, contemporary mystery novelist Robert Crais. Bialar Crais was born in a Sebacean farming community, but while still a boy, he and his younger brother Tauvo were taken from their family and conscripted into the Peacekeeper military. As they were hauled away, Crais' father charged him to look after his younger brother, which was a major burden for Crais. When the human John Crichton accidentally followed a wormhole into the midst of a Peacekeeper battle at the beginning of the series, the younger Crais was killed. For the course of the show's first season, Crais scoured the Uncharted Territories for Crichton and Moya, obsessed with finding the man he blamed for his brother's death. In the eighth episode, an evil entity named Maldis transports Crais and Crichton into a labyrinth forcing them to duel to the death. Crichton eventually wins, but Maldis quickly gets rid of Crais and tells Crichton his plan was to get Crais into a frenzy so he'd bring his Command Carrier further in the Uncharted Territories for a \\"carnage on a truly massive scale\\". While Maldis is defeated by Zhaan, his plan worked nonetheless. Crais disobeys direct orders from High Command and continues the hunt. When Scorpius gets hold of Crichton months later in the end of the first season, Crais joins Scorpius in interrogating Crichton in the Aurora Chair. Eventually, following a false memory, Crais is put in the chair and becomes bitter in the process, especially after he discovers that Scorpius will come with him on the Command Carrier (Scorpius was aware of Crais's crimes) Eventually, Scorpius slowly usurped Crais's position and after a physical fight with the menacing hybrid, Crais realizes that he will soon have to face the consequences of his decisions for the past cycle. He helps the crew of Moya escape and is granted asylum. During the second season, Bialar quickly forms a bond with Moya's offspring, Talyn. Crais finds Talyn difficult to control, but he becomes neurally linked to Talyn and they leave Moya. Crais and Talyn later again cross paths with Moya and her crew after Talyn hears a call of distress from his mother. In the penultimate episode of Season 3, Crais uses Talyn to perform a suicidal Starburst inside Scorpius' command carrier to finally have his vengeance against the horrid hybrid. This heroic act of self-sacrifice effectively destroys the Peacekeeper wormhole project, and Talyn and Crais along with it. In spite of his death, Crais makes a few appearances after his death. An alternate version of Crais appears in “Unrealized Realities”. In this reality, Crichton is a Peacekeeper agent working for Crais, and after Crichton kills Moya's crew, Crais congratulates him for a job well done. In “John Quixote”, Crais appears as an ogre in a virtual reality game. Crais also appears in The Peacekeeper Wars in archive footage. =Stark= Stark, played by Paul Goddard, is Stykera, a specialized subrace of the Banik. He is introduced to the series late in the first season and became a main character during the third season, before disappearing at the end of it and only returning at the end of the fourth season; he played a major part in The Peacekeeper Wars mini-series. Stark wears a half-mask - strapped to his head by two separate buckles - of an unidentified metal, covering an incorporeal area that glows dark orange when uncovered, on the right side of his face (roughly his eye and cheek-bone) that he only reveals when he is taking away someone's pain or \\"crossing over\\" a soul—aiding or comforting a person in the moments prior to their death. However, in doing so, Stark absorbs a small fragment of the soul - and thus the knowledge and lingering emotions - of the person he \\"crosses over\\" into his own psyche, something which might explain his somewhat unbalanced mental behaviour (although his undergoing months of torture may have even more to do with it). In addition, by virtue of being a Stykera, Stark can ease the pain and suffering of others, one of the traits that made him sought after for Scorpius' Aurora Chair research. Stark initially came into contact with John Crichton while both were being held prisoner in Scorpius' first Gammak Base devoted primarily to wormhole research. Having been a prisoner for many years, Stark informs Crichton that his (Stark's) survival is due both to his resistance to the effects of the Aurora chair and his pretense of acting mentally unbalanced in front of the guards, which causes them to leave him alone more often. Stark assists Crichton in his escape to Moya and quickly forms a bond with Zhaan. During one of the crew's misadventures, they are put on trial for murder and Stark is executed by \\"dispersion\\" or the scattering of his molecules into atoms. He survives this because he is mostly made of energy, but his appearances thereafter show him as being more uneven in his personality. After the crew robs the Shadow Depository and Zhaan confronts a lethal illness, he becomes genuinely disturbed and wrought with grief over her death. He joins up with the crew of Talyn but frequently is at odds with his desire to \\"save\\" others, which eventually alienates Aeryn and Crais. Feeling that Zhaan is calling out to him, he eventually parts ways with the crew to search for her spirit. He is later found a prisoner on Katratzi which had been part of the reason Scorpius held him prisoner: he was searching for it and Stark knew where it was from \\"crossing over\\" Scarrens. He is rescued by Chiana and Noranti and rejoins Moya's crew. During The Peacekeeper Wars, he is forced to \\"cross over\\" the Eidolon leader and thus gains his knowledge of the Eidolon powers, something that makes Stark almost crazy. He later transfers the knowledge and regains his usual personality. At the end of the series, Stark finds a measure of peace and leaves his mask with Crichton, revealing that the energy beneath it is now gone. As the series progresses, three different alternate 'versions' of Stark are seen: as a not-quite-sane Gamesmaster in a twisted virtual-reality style game (\\"John Quixote\\"), a fused Stark/Sikozu character witnessed in an alternate reality (\\"Unrealized Reality\\"/\\"Prayer\\") and played by Raelee Hill, and as a convincing bioloid replica of himself (\\"We're So Screwed Part II: Hot to Katratzi\\"). Supporting characters =Jool= Joolushko Tunai Fenta Hovalis, played by Tammy MacIntosh, is a young Interion woman of remarkable academic achievement. She had her first appearance in \\"Self-Inflicted Wounds Part I: Could'a, Would'a, Should'a\\", and her last in \\"The Peacekeeper Wars Part 1\\". While on vacation with her two male cousins—they were traveling around the galaxy to celebrate her birthday—they ran into some trouble. Her two cousins contracted a fatal disease, and they and she were frozen into stasis to be used for organ donation by a Diagnosan. This Diagnosan was later able to remove John Chrichton's neural chip, though the procedure required removing some of his brain and replacing it with a closely related donor species. Interons, like Jool, had the closest physiological match to a human brain, and Crichton reluctantly was saved through a donation by one of her cousins. He later took her and her other cousin's stasis capsules with him onto Moya. Her cousin died almost immediately upon being released from stasis, but Jool, who had not been sick, was fine. She awoke to find herself aboard the Leviathan Moya and discovered that she had been frozen for 22 cycles. Prior to Jool's first appearance one of her cousins, who was revived shortly before his death, referred to her as Jool rather than her full name. John Crichton originated the shortened nickname \\"Jool\\" on-board Moya, and though she resented it at first, it soon grew on her, as did he. While an intelligent young woman, Jool has led a sheltered life, and though she possesses a lot of knowledge, it was rarely practiced before joining the crew who soon became her friends. Jool comes from a peaceful star system far away, and before meeting Rygel, she had not known Hynerians existed, though Sebaceans are familiar to her. When frightened or nervous, her orange hair (which sheds) turns red and her high-frequency screams can melt metal, an ability which proves useful on several occasions. Her arrival aboard Moya came with the loss of Pa'u Zotoh Zhaan, and the crew and fans alike were a little slow in accepting the new character. The crew parted ways and Jool and D'Argo found themselves on Arnessk, where Jool became acquainted with other Interions and helped in their excavation of the site. She helped John, D'Argo and Chiana to free the priests from 12,000-cycle-long sleep in suspended animation. A scholar of Arnesskian history, Jool left Moya after over a cycle with the crew to follow her new destiny and help the priests adjust to the new life that lay ahead of them. In Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars, Moya returned to Arnessk, where the crew were briefly reunited with Jool who, for reasons never explained, had adopted a more Sheena, Queen of the Jungle-like persona. Moya, however, had been followed by the Scarrans who deployed a weapon which destroyed the temple. Jool was inside and is presumed dead. An alternate reality version of Jool, encountered in \\"Unrealized Reality\\" and \\"Prayer\\", was portrayed by Anthony Simcoe. This version is reluctantly shot dead by Crichton in \\"Prayer\\". =Moya= Moya is a Leviathan spacecraft. She had her first appearance in the \\"Premiere\\", and was last seen in \\"The Peacekeeper Wars Part 2\\". Like others of her race, Moya was captured by a Peacekeeper squad at a young age and was bonded with a Pilot, who serves as the Leviathan's navigator, operator, companion, and link to the crew of the ship. Leviathans are ships of peace, and as such have no offensive capabilities. They do have an impressive defensive maneuver, however, called starburst, which allows the ship to travel at incredible speed through a tear in space-time. Moya is maintained by DRDs (Diagnostic Repair Drones), which are small, beetle-like robots that Leviathans build as they grow. They help with Moya's upkeep, by repairing and maintaining Moya. DRDs also play a major role in many of the adventures, helping John and the crew; the most notable DRDs are named 1812, One-Eye, and Pike. Moya was once a captive of the Peacekeepers who control her and other Leviathans through the use of giant control collars placed around the ships that prevent autonomous control and inflict pain upon any disobedience. Moya and Pilot, with the help of Crichton, Zhaan, Rygel and D'Argo, manage to escape. Moya has become a friend and home to her crew and they have been through many bizarre, disheartening, and exhilarating events together. During season one, Moya becomes pregnant thanks to an accidentally released Peacekeeper experiment, and later gives birth to a Peacekeeper/Leviathan hybrid gunship that Aeryn Sun names Talyn, after her father. Despite being only able to communicate through Pilot (with one exception), Moya has her own personality which can be seen to develop and change through the series. At the beginning of the series she is timid, starbursting to escape the slightest danger at a moment's notice. When she meets the Leviathan gods, the Builders, and they order her death for having produced Talyn, she is willing to die, and is only saved when the order is revealed to be a test for Zhaan. By the end of the second season, she is willing to join the effort to rescue Crichton from Scorpius despite her fears, and is severely damaged in the attempt. At the end of the third season, she asks the crew to kill another Leviathan who is disturbing the burial of her child's remains. And in \\"The Peacekeeper Wars\\", this previously timid and peaceful creature trusts the crew enough to allow Crichton to use her to launch the deadly Wormhole Weapon. =Noranti= Utu Noranti Pralatong (called simply Noranti), played by Melissa Jaffer, joined the crew in the Season 3 finale, \\"Dog with Two Bones\\", when she suddenly appears among them as a mysterious and eccentric refugee that escaped to Moya along with an unidentified group of others as a Peacekeeper Command Carrier was being destroyed. The \\"Old Woman\\", as she is called, is a Traskan, and little is known of her past before she joined the crew. Initially appearing to Crichton and Chiana as a grateful cook, she later describes herself as a \\"doctor, instructor, and among many other disciplines . . . negotiator\\". She is basically portrayed as an accomplished herbalist. Although her skills are sometimes not quite as successful as she would like, she does manage to come to the crew's rescue with odd potions and powders on many occasions. At times, she seems to have her own agenda, although what that agenda may be is never quite made clear. Being 293 years old, she sometimes appears to the others as being slightly senile, and is often referred to as \\"Grandma\\". She was featured throughout Season 4 of Farscape, as well as being in The Peacekeeper Wars, where she realizes the existence of more Eidelons and convinces Crichton to seek to reawaken their powers to help end the war. An alternate reality version of Noranti appeared in the Season 4 episode, \\"Unrealized Reality\\", and was portrayed by Gigi Edgley. =Sikozu= Sikozu Svala Shanti Sugaysi Shanu (called Sikozu), played by Raelee Hill, is a Kalish who grew up in Scarran- controlled space. She first appeared in \\"Crichton Kicks\\" and made her last appearance in \\"The Peacekeeper Wars Part 2\\". She becomes an expert (albeit a book expert) on Leviathans, and eventually goes to work for a pirate group who harvest toubray (nerve) fibers from Leviathans. She meets up with Crichton while he is aboard the Leviathan Elack in the Leviathan's sacred burial space; she led the pirates there and they subsequently try to kill her to prevent her telling anyone where the burial area is. Crichton nicknames her \\"Sputnik\\" due to the shape of her hairstyle when they met. There is initial confusion at their meeting because she cannot tolerate translator microbes and so must learn all languages by hearing them. This may not be a species trait, given that she is later exposed as a Bioloid agent, and could be a consequence of that process instead. She is extremely intelligent and picks up information very quickly. She can \\"change her centre of gravity\\" so that she can walk on walls and ceilings, and she can easily reattach limbs that have been severed. She has to eat only a few times a cycle (year). She is extremely arrogant, a self-styled polymath who constantly belittles those around her. While her knowledge about technology, species, history, and the galaxy in general is vast, it is mostly academic. She is extremely naive and unknowledgeable about how things function outside a controlled environment (such as learning Leviathan physiology strictly via studying and not understanding that the floorplans of the biomechanoids vary as a result of passenger preference). Sikozu's sense of self-preservation is foremost in her mind, and so she is prone to switching sides in any conflict with no notice and seemingly no premeditation other than ad hoc judgments on who currently holds the greatest advantage. This makes her true loyalties (if any) uncertain. Sikozu accompanies Crichton as he reunites with his crewmates from Moya, and she gradually allies herself with Scorpius, whom she initially seems intrigued by both because he saves her life and because he is arguably the most powerful and intelligent person on Moya. (He is the first mind Sikozu has known who she acknowledges as her equal or superior.) They eventually become lovers and she takes a place at his side when he is kicked off Moya. Just prior to the Scarran-Peacekeeper war, it is revealed that she is a bioloid (an android) and a double-agent. She is working with the Kalish resistance to free the Kalish from Scarran servitude, and as such was specially bioengineered to be able to hover in the air and release intense radiation heat rays from her body that destroy Scarran heat producing glands, rendering them weak and vulnerable. She is also able to direct this energy in smaller bursts via her hands when necessary. This radiation seems to still be harmful, although to a lesser degree, to Scarran hybrids such as Scorpius. When using her power in his presence, she instructs him to take cover and not to look at her. Late in the war, it is revealed that Sikozu is a spy for the Scarran Empire in exchange for a promise from them to free her people from servitude. Scorpius assaults her after revealing his knowledge about her betrayal and leaves her to die on the water-planet, Qujaga. This development is foreshadowed in several earlier episodes: At their first meeting, Chiana thinks that Sikozu is a spy because she has Scarran currency and speaks Scarran. Sikozu explains this by saying that her people are from Scarran-controlled space. In a visit to an unrealized reality, Crichton — in that reality, a ranking Peacekeeper officer — is forced to execute Sikozu after she is revealed to be a Scarran spy. =Talyn= Talyn is a Peacekeeper/Leviathan hybrid gunship, a living spaceship that is the progeny of the Leviathan Moya. Talyn is named after Aeryn Sun's father. He first appeared in \\"The Hidden Memory\\" and made his last appearance in \\"Into the Lion's Den Part II: Wolf in Sheep's Clothing\\". The Leviathan Moya was subjected to a hybridization experiment by the Peacekeepers while in captivity. A synthetic stimulant/conceptive was placed in her by a peacekeeper Leviathan expert called Velorek, leader of the experiment. It was accidentally released by Ka D'Argo six months after their escape from peacekeeper captivity, leading to the conception of a fetus. Roughly six months later, Moya gave birth to a baby Leviathan, though the baby was far from normal: unlike typical Leviathans, which are streamlined and have no weapons whatsoever, the infant was \\"covered with weapons.\\" During the birthing process, Talyn's external weaponry caused him to become stuck in the birth canal, and he had to fire a low-yield shot from those same weapons to free himself. Shortly after his birth, he had a few disagreements with his mother and refused to talk to her. Moya felt that a Peacekeeper should talk to him. Aeryn boarded Talyn and succeeded in convincing the young Leviathan to listen to his mother. Moya asked Officer Aeryn Sun to name her offspring, and Aeryn named it after her father, Talyn. At times, Talyn could be emotionally unstable, even going so far as to deliberately attack Moya. He also panicked easily. It is unclear whether this resulted from his violent childhood, or from errors in his genome, perhaps the result of trying to create a warship from an essentially nonaggressive species. Talyn was a very powerful ship when young, and had he achieved maturity he would likely have been one of the most powerful ships in the galaxy. He was young (and quite childlike) for much of Farscape, and was dwarfed by his mother Moya, although he did grow gradually over the series. It was theorized by Pilot that he might even have grown larger than a normal Leviathan. At the end of season 3 Talyn sacrificed his life to save the crew of Moya. Captured and disabled while docked inside the Peacekeeper Command Carrier that had been following the crew for three years, Talyn starburst within the carrier, causing a massive energy wave that progressively destroyed the Carrier (while leaving enough time for most of the crew to evacuate the ship). Talyn's remains were carried by Moya to the Leviathan Sacred Space region, something of an elephant graveyard of Leviathans; space they regard as holy and where they go to die. He was mourned by Moya and her crew. Unlike other Leviathans, Talyn does not have a Pilot bonded to him, but still has a vestigial Pilot's den: although he physically could be bonded to a Pilot (he managed to bond temporarily, yet successfully, to Stark in one instance through the Pilot's den), he does not require one in order to navigate himself and fire his weapons. He can operate purely on voice command; still, a humanoid can be implanted with a device that allows direct interface with Talyn, although not to the same extent as a Pilot (Talyn can resist orders from time to time: they're more suggestions than orders). This device, unless properly modified, can also be a two-way street through which Talyn can force feedback through to injure the implanted humanoid. It also leaves the humanoid open to feeling Talyn's pain as Pilot feels Moya's pain. The device's sympathetic effect can even go as far as to physically blind the humanoid if Talyn's sensors are damaged. Also because of the connection strength Talyn can force those connected to him to do his will to a certain degree. This causes great pain to the humanoid pilot to the extent that was seen on Crais. Recurring Peacekeeper characters The symbol used by the Peacekeepers. Out of universe, it references El Lissitzky's 1919 poster \\"Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge.\\"'' Peacekeepers are of the Sebacean race and were originally a law enforcement agency, but has become a private military company which employs their people as mercenary soldiers. For a price, they will serve as the military force for planets that lack one, though this arrangement usually is more advantageous to the Peacekeepers than to their \\"clients\\". During the storyline, the Peacekeepers are known to be employed by Hynerian rebel elements loyal to Dominar Rygel XVI's cousin Bishan (although the extent of their involvement in the rebellion is unknown), and by the rulers of Delvia. The half-breed Scorpius was a notable exception to the Peacekeepers racial purity rules, and was required to endure a loyalty test to be excepted from those rules. The Peacekeepers employ several large groups as slave laborers, notably Banik. Sebaceans are externally similar to humans, and by inference are a genetic offshoot of humans artificially created some 27 millennia before the events of the series; as a result of this genetic enhancement, Sebacean biology has several notable differences. Among the known advantages granted by their creators is a delay in the gestation of the fetus, eyesight significantly keener than that of humans, and average lifespans at least twice that of a human from the 20th century (though it is unclear if this is due to their advanced medical technology). A biological drawback is their inability to deal with extreme heat (due to their genetic loss of the gland required to regulate heat): overheating leads to a state known as the heat delirium, a brain fever that leads to a permanent coma-state referred to as the living death. Until the onset of the final stage, the condition may be halted or even reversed by sufficiently lowering the sufferer's core temperature. =Meeklo Braca= Meeklo Braca, played by David Franklin, was introduced in \\"Bone to Be Wild\\" at the end of season one, although he first appeared in a non-speaking role in \\"The Hidden Memory. At the end of fourth season, it is revealed that Braca's first name is Meeklo. He made his last appearance in \\"The Peacekeeper Wars Part 2\\". Braca's initial appearances focused on a nondescript, professional relationship to Bialar Crais, his commanding officer. As Crais continued his downward spiral into dereliction of duty in his ruthless pursuit of John Crichton, Braca slowly emerged as the voice of quiet dissent among Crais' officers and crew. While harboring serious misgivings about the pursuit, there was no way to act upon these doubts until the Command Carrier arrived at the Gammak Base where John Chrichton had been captured. Braca quickly established himself as Scorpius's assistant once Crais was removed from command, which John Crichton compared to a Mr. Burns and Waylon Smithers interaction. However, their relationship is generally more complex in that Scorpius clearly trusts Braca implicitly, which is unusual for Scorpius' methodical and suspicious nature. Throughout season two, Scorpius mentored Braca, instructing him on strategy, planning, and politics both internal to Peacekeeper command and the galaxy at large. Braca emerged from this grooming with several promotions and quickly established himself as an increasingly efficient and dangerous extension of Scorpius' loyal following. At the beginning of season four, Lieutenant Braca was promoted to Captain Braca by Commandant Mele-On Grayza. Initially, it appeared that he had betrayed Scorpius to Grayza, but by the end of the season it was revealed that Braca was really Scorpius's spy. When Grayza had a mental breakdown in the end of season four due to incompetent handling of a confrontation with the Scarrans, Captain Braca relieved her of command. By invoking an article of Peacekeeper doctrine he maintained his unwavering loyalty to the organization as a whole, removing Grayza from her duties in order to save the lives of the command carrier crew from certain death. Braca later welcomed Scorpius on board, though this was seen as a welcome change compared to Gayza's command structure. When he inquired where Grayza was, Braca said he threw her in the brig, under heavy sedation. Later, in the \\"Farscape: Peacekeeper Wars\\" miniseries Scorpius had been made commander of an armada and used Braca's command carrier as his flagship, and Braca is once again at his side. Although he is wounded during the climactic ground fighting on the planet Qujaga, he is rescued by Scorpius and is able to return with the rest of the group to safety. Braca is last seen fully recovered at the signing of the peace treaty. Due to Scorpius' often isolated lifestyle and history, as well as the generally impersonal nature of Peacekeeper culture, his relationship with Braca is often a mixture of mentoring, paternally guiding, and intellectually stimulating at the same time. It is clear that Braca idolizes Scorpius and hopes to emulate his meteoric rise through the Peacekeeper ranks. He is also, like Scorpius, a \\"true believer\\" in the Peacekeeper cause and willing to go to any lengths to ensure their victory over the Scarrans. Braca's complete devotion to Scorpius is clearly evident when he braves the wrath of Mele-on Grayza in order to remain Scorpius' spy amongst the Peacekeepers, at great risk to his own life and position. =Mele-on Grayza= Commandant Mele-on Grayza, played by Rebecca Riggs, is a Sebacean female who has risen through the Peacekeeper ranks to achieve the status of Commandant. Politically astute and ruthlessly ambitious, she will use anyone or anything at her disposal to achieve her goals. To this end, she has had a gland implanted in her chest that secretes a substance known as Heppel oil, which she uses to bend her (male) victims to her will. A drawback to the gland is that it severely lowers her lifespan. To what degree it is lowered is not explored. Grayza is first seen in \\"Into the Lion's Den Part I: Lambs to the Slaughter\\" towards the end of season three of the series, when she arrives aboard Scorpius' Command Carrier to put a stop to his wormhole research, considering it to be a threat to her efforts to negotiate a truce between the Sebaceans and the Scarran race. However, she becomes intrigued by John Crichton and his wormhole knowledge, believing it to be a potential bargaining chip in her dealings with the Scarrans, and sets out to capture Moya. She is successful in tracking the crew down, and early in season 4, drugs and rapes Crichton: the stated purpose is to gain access to his wormhole knowledge, using allegedly more pleasurable methods than torture; the plan fails, though Crichton spends most of Season Four of Farscape traumatized by his treatment at Grayza's hands. Humiliated, Grayza directs Braca to keep searching for Moya - word spreads quickly to bounty-hunters of the price she puts on Crichton's head - but this also fails. Finally, when her bid for peace is lost, Grayza orders her Command Carrier to engage the Scarrans in conflict, only to be stopped by her subordinate Captain Meeklo Braca, who has secretly been allied with Scorpius while pretending to be loyal to Grayza. He assumes command of the Command Carrier. Although reported by Braca to be under sedation in the brig at the end of the series, by the time of Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars, Grayza is seen as an advisor to the Peacekeeper Grand Chancellor, whilst also pregnant. The child's father is not identified, leaving open the question of whether it is the Grand Chancellor's, John Crichton's, or someone else's baby. If Crichton's, Grayza's pregnancy could have been planned by her to get the wormhole knowledge from the child. The Scarran race had developed the science to remove knowledge from DNA, attempting to do just that from Crichton's unborn child with Aeryn Sun; it can be safely assumed that the Peacekeepers could do the same. Grayza eventually kills the Grand Chancellor when he tells her of his intention to surrender to the Scarrans, and she takes command of the Peacekeeper forces herself. When Crichton finally demonstrates the destructive powers of the wormhole weapon, she agrees to a truce with the Scarrans \\"for the sake of our children\\". She is last seen aboard Moya, signing the peace treaty alongside Emperor Staleek, overseen by the Eidelon. =Gilina Renaez= Gilina Renaez (played by Alyssa-Jane Cook) is a Sebacean Peacekeeper technical specialist. Unlike the soldier caste, she sees little to no combat during her career and is instead utilized for maintenance and engineering tasks. Gilina first encountered the crew of Moya when the Leviathan discovered the wreckage of the legendary Zelbinion (episode \\"PK Tech Girl\\"). After the crew boarded the derelict Command Carrier, they discovered Gilina already there. She explained that she was the lone surviving member of a team sent there by Captain Crais to salvage whatever they could from the vessel; the rest of her companions had been slaughtered by a previous visit of Sheyangs set on stripping the former ship. She had also heard of Aeryn Sun's defection from the Peacekeepers, and while not overly hostile, Gilina's opinion of her was not favourable (openly accusing her as a \\"traitor\\"). When the Sheyangs returned, she helped Moya's crew repair the Zelbinions defence screen, preventing Moya from being destroyed, and agreed to install the screen on Moya. Gilina and John Crichton also shared an immediate attraction to one another. As they worked to move the defence screen to Moya, they grew continually closer until they eventually shared a kiss. After the Sheyang attack was repelled and the screen was installed on Moya, the crew decided that the best course of action would be to leave Gilina behind to be picked up by Crais. Gilina readily agreed not to inform her superior of their visit and appropriation of Peacekeeper technology: while her opinion of Aeryn had changed to one of quiet respect despite her status, she may have also been fearful of suffering Aeryn's fate - being deemed \\"irreversibly contaminated\\" by alien life-forms and banished from the Peacekeepers - as Aeryn herself pointed out. Reluctantly, Crichton and Gilina parted ways (in Crichton's words: \\"Life sucks.\\"). Some time later, Gilina was transferred from Crais' ship to Scorpius' Gammak base(although it is never explained how since it is unlikely Crais would make a stop at any Peacekeeper facility unless absolutely necessary). When Crichton and Chiana arrived to find a tissue sample for Aeryn (episode \\"Nerve\\"), she recognised Crichton masquerading as a Peacekeeper officer and aided them getting past the base's security. Though she realized that Crichton no longer felt as strongly for her as he had before, she agreed to help them. When Crichton was apprehended by Scorpius, Gilina used her superior knowledge of the Peacekeeper systems to get off the base, before attempting to help Crichton during his interrogations in the Aurora Chair while initially remaining undiscovered. Eventually, she reprogrammed the chair to show a false memory of Crais and Crichton making a deal, resulting in a reprieve for Crichton while Crais was later interrogated (episode \\"The Hidden Memory\\"). When Aeryn arrived to rescue Crichton, Gilina helped them flee the base, but chose to stay rather than leave her life as a Peacekeeper behind. However, she would later change her mind, realising that she truly did want to leave with Crichton and that if she stayed, her part in Crichton's escape would eventually be discovered. When Crichton was caught and held at gunpoint by Scorpius during his attempted escape, Gilina unexpectedly came to his rescue, armed with a pulse rifle; her hesitation to fire on Scorpius, however, led to him shooting her instead. This distraction gave Crichton the chance to break away and escape with the rest of Moya's crew and Gilina, now mortally wounded. She had saved Crichton's life, at the cost of her own. She spent her final moments on Moya. As she lay dying, Stark helped ease her pain, showing her a memory of a place he had kept hidden during his many sessions in the Aurora Chair. She professed her love for Crichton and he admitted that he could have loved her as well. They shared one final kiss before she died. Almost three cycles after her death, Crichton and Chiana would encounter Gilina in another form, appearing in a neural-based, video game-like device of Stark's that was apparently based on Crichton's own memories (episode \\"John Quixote\\"). Her character was present on the Gammak base level and was later destroyed by one of the game's versions of Scorpius. =Selto Durka= Selto Durka (played by David Wheeler) was a legendary Peacekeeper captain in command of the command carrier Zelbinion. His most famed accomplishments were the liberation of Mintaka III and the quelling the Senovion rebellion. Many of his tactics are required learning during Peacekeeper training. Durka was also an inveterate sadist, and frequently tortured prisoners that came under his supervision. In Farscape, he was particularly known for torturing Rygel. He was first seen in PK Tech Girl, then in Durka Returns, and finally in Liars, Guns and Money. During a Peacekeeper invasion of the Nebari sector, over 100 cycles (years) prior to the events covered by the TV Series, the Zelbinion was crippled by Nebari \\"Host\\" vessel. The crew refused to surrender to Nebari \\"mind cleansing\\" and were all killed, and Durka apparently committed suicide. However, it is later revealed that he had faked his own death by murdering a junior officer, and fled the Zelbinion in an escape pod. He was later captured by the Nebari and spent the next 100 cycles (years) in stasis being mind cleansed into an obedient, pacifistic servant of the Nebari Establishment. When Durka and his Nebari master later encountered the crew of Moya, he was recognised by Rygel who promptly tried to kill him with a makeshift bomb. However the explosion only succeeded in somehow negating the mind cleansing, and Durka was returned to his old violent self. In short order, he (allegedly) murdered his Nebari keeper and hijacked Moya, but the crew eventually succeeded in luring him into a trap. While he was powering up the weapons on the crippled Nebari ship on which he had arrived, it was jettisoned into space, leaving him stranded on board the derelict vessel. About a cycle (year) later, Rygel discovered that Durka survived their last encounter and was then the leader of the Zenetan Pirates with which he was trying to negotiate. Durka tried to kill Rygel, but Rygel came prepared for his treachery and killed Durka instead, a surprisingly abrupt end for so prominent a villain in the series. For the next few days, Rygel carried Durka's severed head around on a stake, as a trophy of his final victory over the man who tortured him for so long. =Talyn Lyczac= Talyn Lyczac was a Peacekeeper soldier and the father of Aeryn Sun. At the beginning of the series, he has been dead for many cycles. Talyn is rare for a Peackeeper in that he met and fell in love with another Peacekeeper, Xhalax Sun. Together, they deliberately conceived Aeryn, as a symbol of their love. When the Peacekeepers discovered their relationship and the daughter they had sired, they gave Xhalax a choice. She could kill Talyn or she could kill Aeryn. Xhalax executes Talyn, which is her initiation into the life of an assassin for the Peacekeepers. Aeryn would later name Moya's son Talyn in honor of her father. Almost two cycles later, Aeryn tries to contact her dead father on the planet Valldon. There, an alien being claims to be Talyn. It is soon revealed, however, that he is not Talyn, but an impostor hired by Xhalax in her attempt to kill Aeryn and cause her the same kind of pain Xhalax felt when forced to make her horrific choice between her daughter and her lover. (The false Talyn wears an insect-like prosthetic over half of his face, claiming to have thus changed his appearance through surgery when going into hiding; a similar half-face appears on the \\"bioloid\\" imposter of Aeryn after Crichton shoots her in the head.) =Teeg= Lieutenant Teeg, played by played by Christine Stephen-Daly, was stationed on Captain Bialar Crais' Command Carrier as early as two cycles before Moya's escape from captivity. She is his first officer and is fiercely loyal and supportive. When Crais' brother is killed, it falls to her to inform him. Months after Moya's escape, Teeg and Crais receive orders from Peacekeeper High Command to withdraw from the Uncharted Territories. After Crais is abducted and returned by Maldis, Teeg informs him of an attempt by another officer to remove him from command, an action that she has prevented. She also notifies him that she remains the only other person besides Crais who knows about the admiral's order. Making sure it stays that way, Crais snaps her neck, ending the life of his most faithful officer. Teeg's murder goes undiscovered until Crais is placed into the Aurora Chair by Scorpius several months later. =Xhalax Sun= Xhalax Sun (played by Linda Cropper) is the mother of Aeryn Sun, with whom she had never formed a personal relationship due to Peacekeeper rules. Xhalax is first seen in season three of the series, as the leader of a Peacekeeper retrieval squad sent to recapture Talyn. It is revealed that Xhalax, a former spaceship pilot, had been forced to become an assassin as punishment for her crimes of having formed a romantic relationship with another Peacekeeper, having intentionally chosen to have a child with him, and then having established contact with that child (albeit briefly), all of which violated Peacekeeper rules. When her crimes were discovered via security camera when she secretly visited Aeryn when Aeryn was a child, in order to inform her that her life was not an accident or an assigned birthing to fill the ranks, Xhalax was forced to choose between killing Aeryn and killing Aeryn's father, Talyn (for whom the aforementioned Talyn had been named). Her superiors told her that after making this choice she would be forgiven and allowed to return to being a pilot, but she was never reinstated in her former position and was instead assigned assassination missions from that time on. This line of work slowly made her become cold and bitter, seemingly destroying the love that she'd shown during her clandestine visit to young Aeryn's barracks, and the love for which she'd sacrificed the life of her lover in order to save their child. Decades later, when she was assigned to the Peacekeeper retrieval squad, she met Aeryn once again and explained what had happened after she'd visited Aeryn. She accused Aeryn of being sentimental and weak for having named the spaceship Talyn after the father she'd never met. That encounter ended with Talyn seriously crippled and Crais having claimed to have killed Xhalax to prevent her from completing her mission to capture Talyn for the Peacekeepers. In reality, he had allowed Xhalax to leave them because he knew that otherwise, the Peacekeepers would simply send another retrieval squad. Aeryn encountered Xhalax once again later on, and a situation arose from which only one could escape alive. During a tense standoff, Aeryn managed to reason with Xhalax only to see Xhalax shot down by Bialar Crais who through no fault of his own misinterpreted the standoff as unacceptably dangerous to Aeryn. Dying, Xhalax told Aeryn that her true selfdom had been killed years before by her unyielding loyalty to the Peacekeepers. Her last request was for Aeryn to let her fall from the high ledge where their standoff had taken place. As a token of respect, Aeryn acquiesced. Recurring Scarran characters The Scarrans are large humanoids that are distinctly reptilian in appearance and display a noticeable variation in body types. Most members of this species are perhaps best described as tailless \\"lizard men\\" with extended necks and long muzzled faces that some have found reminiscent of a horse. A significantly smaller portion possess a slightly smaller and more humanoid face on a shorter neck. Finally there is a third and even rarer variety that are almost human in proportion though their faces retain a certain bestial mien. There have been examples of male Scarrans of all three types, but the only females seen to date have been of this last variety - a large sexual dimorphism exists between the large muscular males and the smaller svelte females. As these Scarran women possess breasts, it may be inferred that they give birth to and nurture live young; whether the same can be said of females of the other types is uncertain. Scarrans are known to reproduce in a manner physically compatible with humans and Sebaceans. By inference natives of a hot world,Season 2, Episode 11, \\"Look at the Princess Part I: A Kiss is But a Kiss\\". Scarrans nonetheless seem comfortable in temperate conditions to the point that their military facilities are heated to a level comfortable for non-Scarrans. This may have to do with the specialized gland in their chest that permits a Scarran to emit a focused beam of heat, usually from the hand, that proves exceptionally useful for purposes of torture and interrogation. Some Scarrans are skilled enough in applying this ability and studying the response its effects elicit that they can tell whether or not the victim is answering truthfully, though certain individuals (including the Scarran/Sebacean hybrid Scorpius) seem immune to this probe. The gland's ability to produce heat is negated by sub-zero temperatures, and its removal has a noticeably debilitating physical effect. The indifference to climate may, however, be due to the Scarran being cold-blooded, similar to reptiles, and that evolution resulted in a gland that 'stores' heat, which may be discharged as a defensive mechanism. Scarran society is structured along imperial lines, with an Emperor in overall charge. This position's power is not absolute - an incompetent may be removed by a Council (of Ministers). Though dynastic succession is expected, killing the current Emperor and taking power is a perfectly legitimate means of ascending to the throne which has no gender restriction on who may occupy it.Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars The position of War Minister is considered the third to the Emperorship in terms of power and prestige within Scarran society, though whether this is constitutional mandate or a result of the Imperium's inexorable mobilisation to war by the time of the Farscape series is unknown. The Scarran Imperium rose to its current position as a major galactic power within the last 12,000 cycles and within that time they have come into conflict with the Peacekeepers, both civilisations laying claim to parts of the so-called Uncharted Territories into which their populaces might expand. How long the state of cold war has existed between them is unknown - though legend tells of the Eidelons creating a peace between the two species over 12,000 years prior to the Farscape series at the temple on Arnesk, the testimony of the Eidelons themselves as to their lack of familiarity with the Scarran species would indicate the story as the galaxy knows it is fallacious. By the end of the Farscape series, hostilities between Scarrans and Peacekeepers escalate into an open conflict that lasts for a number of months; almost without exception, the Scarran war machine carries every battle, conquering many systems both within the Uncharted Territories, and under Peacekeeper control. Despite this, the war is brought to a peaceful conclusion with no victor when John Crichton utilises a wormhole weapon with the potential to destroy the galaxy in order to frighten both sides into signing a peace treaty. =Ahkna, War Minister= Ahkna is an upper-caste member of the Scarran race, played by Francesca Buller (the wife of co-star Ben Browder who plays series protagonist John Crichton). She is a Minister of War throughout the last few episodes of Season 4 of the series. Her position makes her the third most powerful Scarran in the Empire, under Emperor Staleek. Ahkna believes in the superiority of the Scarran race and would do almost anything to ensure that the Scarrans dominate the galaxy. Several months before the war between the Scarrans and the Peacekeepers, Ahkna meets with Commandant Mele-On Grayza to discuss a peace treaty between the two powers. Grayza offers the Luxan territories to the Scarrans in exchange for Peacekeeper control of the Uncharted Territories and a peace treaty. Ahkna accepts the arrangement and signs the treaty, but betrays Grayza a moment later when her escorts open fire on Grayza's party, killing everyone but Grayza and Captain Braca. Ahkna takes Grayza and Braca to her ship, planning to later interrogate them about the Peacekeepers' alleged wormhole technology. Before she can do this, however, Grayza and Braca are freed by Aeryn Sun and Sikozu. Ahkna's group manages to capture Aeryn, and she turns her over to Captain Jenek. Ahkna is later at Katratzi with Emperor Staleek when John Crichton arrives with the supposed intention of selling his wormhole knowledge to the highest bidder. Though she is suspicious of his motivations, she can do little to him since 1) it is Staleek's decision, not hers and 2) Crichton has a nuclear bomb strapped to his chest. Ahkna is relatively fearless, however, and menaces Crichton despite the nuclear bomb, almost setting it off. At the time, Scorpius is being held captive in the base and Ahkna takes much pleasure in torturing him. Despite the efforts of her underlings, Katratzi is all but destroyed by Crichton and his companions. With their precious flower destroyed, Ahkna leaves Katratzi with Staleek. Within a number of days, Ahkna and Staleek have discovered that a large supply of crystherium flower exist on Earth. Staleek sends Ahkna's lover Pennoch in a Scarran Stryker to attack and subdue the planet. Ahkna loses her love, however, when the efforts of Crichton, Aeryn, and Pilot cause the collapse of the wormhole connected to Earth while Pennoch is still inside of it. Two months later, Ahkna helps lead the war effort against the Peacekeepers. With superior forces and firepower, the Scarrans win every battle against the Peacekeepers. Ahkna is stationed aboard Staleek's Decimator at the Emperor's side. Ahkna is zealous in her campaign against the Peacekeepers, more so than the Emperor himself, believing that the war should only end with their enemy's total annihilation. Ahkna often acts without Staleek's consent, doing what benefits both her and the Scarran race. Pleased with her determination and ruthlessness, Staleek all but promises her rule of the Scarran Empire by his side at the completion of the war. Ahkna's final battle takes place on the ravaged surface of Qujaga. After prolonged ground combat between Peacekeeper and Scarran forces, Crichton and his allies try to move out from their fortified position and escape to Moya. Ahkna's forces intercept them on the way and Ahkna holds Crichton at gunpoint. Before she can fire, however, Aeryn shoots her in the back, ending her life. =Pennoch= Captain Pennoch is a high ranking Scarran soldier and the lover of War Minister Ahkna. He is played by Jonathan Pasvolsky and later by John Adam. He usually appears in the service of Ahkna or Emperor Staleek and can often be seen at their side or carrying out their orders. He accompanies Ahkna to her meeting with Commandant Grayza on a dead Leviathan and commerce center. He later assists in the capture of Aeryn Sun when her pulse rifle proves to be ineffective against his thick hide. He is also present at the meeting and devastation at Katratzi. He is sent on his final mission by Emperor Staleek. In command of a Scarran Stryker, Pennoch heads for the wormhole that leads to Earth. When the Stryker arrives and enters, however, Crichton has already begun to collapse the wormhole. The Stryker is caught in the implosion, destroying the ship and killing Pennoch as Ahkna can only listen helplessly. =Staleek= Emperor Staleek is the Scarran emperor, played by Duncan Young and is a major antagonist in both the series and the mini-series. He first appears in the \\"We're So Screwed\\" three-part story in season 4, holding a conference at the secret moon of Katratzi. It was there he first encounters John Crichton. Crichton comes to Katratzi under the guise of selling the information he has on wormhole technology to the highest bidder. Crichton is truly there to rescue Scorpius, whom Staleek has prisoner at the base. During that time, Staleek hopes to find a way to capture Crichton without setting off the nuclear bomb attached to Crichton's belt. He is also under the impression that Scorpius is his spy and double agent, but in truth, Scorpius turns out to be a triple agent whose true allegiance is to the Peacekeepers. When Crichton severely damages the Katratzi base, Staleek orders Captain Pennoch to Earth, as he has learned from Crichton that the planet contains a large supply of the crystherium flower, vital to the Scarrans' power. Pennoch's mission fails and his ship is destroyed by Crichton and Aeryn Sun. Staleek later takes an active role in the Peacekeeper-Scarran war, traveling in his flagship the Decimator. He personally captures Crichton at Arnessk and is later present at the battle over Qujaga where Crichton unleashes a wormhole weapon and forces the two sides to make peace. Crichton mockingly calls him Emperor Sleestak, a play on his name and also a reference to Land of the Lost, a 1970s children's Saturday morning Sci-Fi TV show that featured lizard-like humanoid antagonists, presumably remembered from John Crichton's youth. =Captain Jenek= Captain Jenek is a Scarran freighter captain and a member of the Scarran ruling caste who serves as a major antagonist in the fourth season, played by Jason Clarke. Jenek serves as Aeryn's jailer while she is in Scarran custody, keeping her on board his ship and torturing her both physically and psychologically while his ship made its way to the Katratzi base. After forcing her to tell him that Crichton is the father of her child, he continues his path to Katratzi, intending to have scientists extract wormhole information from its DNA. Jenek's ship stops at a border station that Moya's crew are also on, having disguised themselves as Scarran agents. While on the station, Noranti infects Rygel with a contagious Hynerian disease to have the station put into quarantine. Jenek becomes paranoid the disease will kill Aeryn and attempts to place her baby inside Chiana, as Nebari are immune to the disease. Moya's crew engaged in an operation to prevent this, and Scorpius lured him off ship. When Jenek caught onto his ruse, Scorpius attacked Jenek and was promptly beaten into submission by the Scarran captain and taken prisoner, though Aeryn and Chiana were rescued. Jenek arrived in Katratzi with Scorpius and attended the peace conference, serving as the chief security officer. Jenek is killed when Crichton's homemade nuclear bomb detonated, destroying the base. Other recurring characters =Bekhesh= Bekhesh is the leader of a group of Tavlek mercenaries but later gives up his life of violence. He is played by John Adam. He wears a gauntlet weapon that injects him with a narcotic stimulant, giving him increased speed, strength, and aggression, but also resulting in addiction. The gauntlet can also fire short energy bursts with an output that is on par with a pulse pistol blast, able to kill a target in one hit, and can absorb blasts too. He is featured in the episode \\"Throne for a Loss\\" and the trilogy \\"Liars, Guns, and Money\\". He is first encountered by the crew of Moya shortly after John Crichton's arrival in the Uncharted Territories. Posing as a group of traders, Bekhesh's group attempts to rob Moya shortly after boarding. While deterred from stealing any goods, Bekhesh manages to kidnap Rygel, because they have been led to believe by the Hynerian that he is a valuable prisoner, the current dominar of a great empire. Bekhesh takes Rygel to the planet below and imprisons him in a makeshift cell, burying the Hynerian halfway into the ground as he waits for the crew of Moya to pay Rygel's ransom. Despite Rygel's supposed value, Bekhesh treats him mercilessly and does not tolerate dissent. When Rygel tries to escape, Bekhesh strangles him, nearly causing the Hynerian's death. Rygel's crewmates eventually come for him and as Bekhesh and Crichton have a Mexican standoff, Crichton is able to convince Bekhesh that Rygel is not worth anything. Bekhesh gives him up, deciding that Rygel has already been more trouble than he could ever be worth. Almost two cycles later, Crichton seeks Bekhesh out, hoping to acquire the gauntlet to use it in an assault to rescue D'Argo's son. He discovers that Bekhesh had given up his life of violence and has joined a pacifist holy order. He is, however, unwilling to give up the gauntlet and agrees to go with Crichton. After Crichton later turns himself over to Scorpius in exchange for Jothee, Bekhesh helps stage an assault on a Shadow Depository, fighting beside D'Argo and Aeryn in an effort to rescue Crichton. After their success, Bekhesh takes his cut and thanks the crew of Moya for bringing him back to his life of violence. Unlike other Tavleks, Bekhesh wears some type of masking shield over the top of his head. Its purpose is unknown but it is implied that it is due to injury. =D.K. (Douglas Knox)= John Crichton's childhood friend who, along with Crichton, formulated the theory that was being tested by the Farscape project. Crichton helped D.K. cheat on his SATs, and helped get him his job at IASA. In the episode \\"Terra Firma\\" D.K. and his wife were killed by an alien named Skreeth. D.K. appears in the episodes \\"Premiere\\", \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Unrealized Reality\\" and \\"Terra Firma\\". =Einstein= First introduced in Season 4, \\"Einstein\\" is an Ancient who has tremendous knowledge of wormholes, time and theoretical physics. His appearance is a plot device which provides John Crichton with an opportunity to finally harness wormhole travel and return to Earth, a main focus of the series. He is shown as enigmatic and ultimately fake, appearing as an eyeless, gray-skinned human being wearing a suit and tie, obviously in imitation of Crichton's memories, as he is not truly existent in Crichton's world, simply a manifestation of another, vastly more powerful being. He is one of the many 'godlike aliens' which episodes of Farscape often center around, presenting alternate realities and confusing illusions, similar to Maldis and the Ancients. Einstein actually reveals to Crichton that the Ancients are members of his race, though substantially modified, who provide intelligence of 'normal' space. There are allusions and references made to the Pathfinder wormhole-traversing race as well as the extradimensional entity from the Season One episode Through the Looking Glass. The moniker \\"Einstein\\" is given to him by Crichton. His true name, and whether he has one, is not known. In Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars, after considerable badgering by Crichton, Einstein removes the mental blocks preventing Crichton from turning a wormhole into a weapon. After Crichton builds such a weapon and uses it to coerce the Peacekeepers and Scarrans to negotiate peace, Einstein strips the knowledge from his mind even as he's shutting off the weapon. He is played by John Bach. =Furlow= Furlow (played by Magda Szubanski) is a knowledgeable, yet somewhat arrogant, mechanic on the desert world Dam-Ba-Da. While her race is not known, she appears to be a rather short and stocky female, likely Sebacean. The crew of Moya first met Furlow when John Crichton and Aeryn Sun were forced to land John's IASA Farscape One module there after it had suffered damage in space. Furlow offered to repair John's ship, provided he could pay for it. When repairs were completed, and compensation was demanded, Crichton admitted that he had nothing with which to pay her. Furlow demanded all the flight data he had recorded on wormholes so far to Crichton's dismay. Two cycles later, one of the twinned Crichtons returned to Dam-Ba-Da aboard Talyn. An Ancient in the guise of Jack Crichton had accused him of selling the wormhole knowledge given to him by the ancients. However, Crichton had given the knowledge to Furlow before ever meeting the Ancients. Furlow used the wormhole information given to her by John, as well as a replica of the Farscape One module, to conduct her own wormhole research. Her plan was to sell it to the highest bidder--in this case the Scarrans, via the Charrids. When John and Ancient Jack arrived on Dam-Ba-Da, the Charrids had already taken over Furlow's garage in order to secure the knowledge for the Scarrans, who were on their way to the planet. Before John, Aeryn, and Jack were able to destroy the information, the Scarrans downloaded some of it, so \\"Jack\\" came up with a plan to destroy the Scarran ship, deciding to build a device that used wormholes as a weapon. Before the Scarrans arrived, however, Furlow betrayed them, killing Jack. She stole the completed device--a displacement engine--and fled her shop in a vehicle, hoping to sell the engine to the Scarrans when they arrived. Crichton pursued and caused Furlow to crash, inadvertently exposing the radioactive material that powered the engine. Knowing that approaching the engine would mean risking a fatal dose of radiation, Furlow fled, and urged Crichton to do the same. But Crichton instead retrieved the engine, sacrificing his life in order to ensure that the Scarrans would not retain the information they'd just stolen. Furlow's whereabouts thereafter remain unknown as she never again appears in the series. =Jack Crichton= John Robert \\"Jack\\" Crichton, Sr. is a retired astronaut who at one point had walked on the Moon, and the father of John Crichton; Jack is played by Kent McCord. During his time in the Uncharted Territories, the junior Crichton would often think of his father. In his first year, he would sometimes record his thoughts into a tape recorder, usually addressing Jack in his recordings. A member of the Ancients took on his form when conversing with John Crichton. Initially this was to fool John while studying human reactions (for a possible colonisation of Earth). Following John seeing his true form, the illusion was retained for unknown reasons (Possibly to make John feel more at ease with him). Around a cycle later, John would again encounter a false image of his father. This was the result of a Scarran interrogation device which presented Crichton with increasingly erratic and irrational imagery in order to break his mind. A cycle after this incident, John again encounters the Ancient in the form of his father. Assumedly, this Ancient took the form of Jack to make Crichton more comfortable as they worked together to keep wormhole technology out of the hands of the Scarrans. \\"Ancient Jack\\" was eventually killed by Furlow who had hoped to sell the wormhole tech to the Scarrans. Crichton would finally see his real father again, about a cycle later, though this time he encountered Jack when he was younger in 1985. Crichton soon discovered that his presence in the past had altered history and that Jack was now to command the tragic final flight of the space shuttle Challenger. Crichton and his friends did what they could to fix the timeline, while John avoided any unnecessary contact with his parents. It seems, however, that Jack later caught a glimpse of his grown son shortly after he had rescued the younger 1985-John from a burning house. When John and the rest of Moya's crew returned to the present, they discovered that they were still in Earth orbit, now in late 2003. John and Jack reunited on Moya, though John was hesitant at first, wary of yet another Ancient-created, or similar, illusion. John accepted that he had finally returned home and he along with the crew of Moya spent some time on Earth. During their stay, John was distressed to learn that Jack now had, while nationalistic, an isolationist attitude toward the other nations of the world, due primarily to the September 11 terrorist attacks. In spite of their differences, John eventually convinced his father to support a unified globe, knowing it was their only chance Earth had if they hoped to face the challenges of the galaxy that Crichton had already faced. Months later, Crichton would contact Jack one last time. With the Scarrans on their way to attack Earth, John decided to collapse the wormhole linking Earth to the area of the galaxy near the Uncharted Territories and Tormented Space. After landing a transport pod on the Moon, John used one of its communicators to dial Jack's house. They wished each other good bye and Jack expressed his pride in John and all he had done before they closed the line. =Jothee= Jothee is the half-Luxan/half-Sebacean son of Ka D'Argo and his late wife Lo'Laan, played by Matthew Newton, and later by Nathaniel Dean. After the death of Lo'Laan, D'Argo left Jothee in the care of others. In the time between D'Argo giving him up and his reappearance, the details are vague. It was implied that Jothee spent time as a slave, as he was found among Banik slaves. As a result of his separation, Jothee was denied most of the Luxan upbringing and, after being the subject of abuse over his mixed heritage, mutilated his more Luxan features. While on Moya Jothee had an affair with Chiana, who was his father's lover, which caused a rift between both D'Argo and Chiana, and D'Argo and Jothee. Jothee left Moya's crew at this point. His whereabouts between his departure from Moya and PK Wars are unknown. Two cycles later, Jothee re-appeared as the \\"Kleeva\\" (a military strategist and officer) of a small Luxan commando unit during PK Wars. According to comic continuity later, Jothee's unique background helped him achieve the honor of becoming the youngest Kleeva in the history of the Luxan people. Jothee's skills are primarily tactic and mind based, unlike his father who quite often relied upon his brute strength, anger, and intimidating stature to get results. =Maldis= Maldis (played by Chris Haywood) was a recurring villain within the series. By his very nature, Maldis enjoys the pain and death of others, feeding off them like a psychic vampire. Though his exact origin and nature is unknown, Maldis is a powerful, non-corporeal being, having seemingly met his mortal end on several occasions, but always returning. He is sometimes likened to as the \\"Q\\" of Farscape, also far more sinister. He appeared in the episodes \\"That Old Black Magic\\" and \\"Picture if You Will\\". Maldis wields immense powers which enable him to shapeshift, allowing him to take on any form he wishes, thus obscuring his true age or species. Maldis has reconstituted his physical form on more than one occasion, and occupied spaces beyond the normal dimensions of spacetime, hinting that he may be more than a mere sentient being. The crew first encounters Maldis while visiting a commerce planet early in their adventures. Taking the form of a clown named Igg, he demonstrates that he knows a lot about Crichton, and explains that he serves a benevolent old magician named Haloth (also Maldis). Haloth tells Crichton he has the ability to set up a meeting between himself and Bialar Crais, at which Crichton can explain to Crais the circumstances of his brother's death, which will end the Peacekeeper captain's pursuit. Then Maldis, as Haloth, also approaches Crais, offering him John Crichton for a price. When Crais agrees, Haloth reveals himself to Crichton, and unleashes Crais upon him within an arena of his own devising. As the two fight, Zhaan gains help from a local high priest, Liko. Together, they work to unleash Zhaan's abilities to inflict pain and damage on others. Interrupting Maldis' attempt to kill Crichton and feed off his soul, Zhaan renders the dark sorcerer tangible, allowing Crichton to smash his physical form to bits. Many months later, Chiana obtains a unique picture from a woman named Kyvan. She begins experiencing progressively more dangerous \\"accidents\\" seemingly predicted by images in the picture. After attempts to examine it end in Chiana's disappearance, the crew try destroying the picture to bring her back. The picture reassembles again and again, eventually causing D'Argo to disappear as well. The remaining crew eventually learn from Kyvan that the image was commissioned by Maldis. Zhaan enacts a plan to defeat the wizard again. Zhaan thrusts Crichton into the portrait, where he distracts Maldis while Zhaan instructs Aeryn to kill Kyvan (actually an extension of Maldis) so that he is weakened enough to be physically dispersed again. With more of his links to the physical world destroyed, Maldis is once again banished to an unknown region to conserve his energies until he gains enough strength for his inevitable return (although he does not manifest again in the series). =Grunchlk= Grunchlk is an unkempt and opportunistic swindler who runs a medical facility, played by Hugh Keays-Byrne. Grunchlk serves as the go- between for Diagnosans (to whom translator microbes are fatal) and patients, though he often overcharges the patients, occasionally against the Diagnosan's wishes. Grunchlk also keeps dying patients cryogenically frozen so that Diagnosans can use their parts in medical procedures, trapping them between life and death. On some occasions he freezes their family members as well, as seen with Jool and her cousins. Grunchlk is first seen in “Die Me, Dichtomy”, where Moya is brought to his facility to treat burn wounds she had sustained during the “Liar, Guns, and Money” three-parter. Grunchlk also agrees to have the Diagnosan remove the neural chip from John's brain. Scorpius, signaled by Harvey after the neural clone briefly took control of Crichton's body, formed a deal with Grunchlk that would have him give Scorpius the neural chip in exchange for payment. When Scorpius arrives alongside a squad of Peacekeeper commandos, Grunchlk sets a cryogenic pod containing a Scarran agent to thaw as insurance against Scorpius, planning to stop the pod from thawing should Scorpius live up to his end of the bargain. After a Diagnosan opens the pod prematurely and is murdered by the Scarran, Scorpius places an implant in Grunchlk's brain that allowed him to take control of Grunchlk's body. The Scorpius-controlled Grunchlk encountered the Scarran, and the Scarran placed Grunchlk inside a cryogenic pod and froze him. Stark, who was horrified by Grunchlk's use of the cryogenic pods, reported him as dead to the rest of the crew and left him frozen. In The Peacekeeper Wars, Grunchlk returns, having somehow escaped the pod, and now with another Diagnosan, who had given Chiana new eyes. Grunchlk and the Diagnosan accompany Chiana to Qujaga to treat Aeryn and Crichton. =Jack the Ancient= “Jack” is an Ancient who takes the form of Crichton's father Jack and serves as something of a mentor to John, played by Kent McCord. Jack is not actually his name, but rather a nickname Crichton gives him, as Jack's true name is pronounced through a series of incomprehensible sounds. Jack first appears when he places John, Aeryn, Rygel, and D'Argo inside a simulation of Earth, so that he can determine if it would be a suitable home for the Ancients. Jack takes the form of Jack Crichton, as it was deemed suitable to get John to trust him. Crichton eventually uncovers the ruse, and Jack reveals the purpose of the experiment to him. Though Crichton is understandably angry over the manipulation, the two part on civil terms. While Crichton is being tortured by Scorpius in the Aurora Chair, Scorpius uncovers a repressed memory of Jack. It is revealed that Jack, as an apology, implanted wormhole knowledge in Crichton's brain so he would be able to return to Earth faster, and erased the memory because the Ancients believe that if one does not discover the knowledge by themselves, they do not deserve it. This proves crucial to the rest of the series, establishing the central arc of the Peacekeepers and later the Scarrans pursuing John for his wormhole knowledge. After discovering a Charrid using a replica of Crichton's module to fly through a wormhole, Jack is sent by the other Ancients to track Crichton down and see if he had given away wormhole knowledge. After Crichton makes it clear he did not, the two deduce that Furlow was the one using the wormhole knowledge. The two tracked her to Dam-Ba-Da, and found the Charrids and Scarrans has turned on her. With a Scarran dreadnought on the way, Jack and Crichton planned to destroy the ship and Furlow's equipment along with the ship itself, by building a wormhole weapon. Jack intends to activate the weapon himself, not wanting to endanger Crichton's life, but Furlow shoots and fatally wound him. Crichton comforts Jack in his final moments, and after he dies, Jack reverts to his true form.

Thereafter, the southern terminus of the LSPJR regular services became Barton (or Downholland as it was occasionally known). The \\"Altcar Bob\\" service, introduced in July 1906, was so named because it terminated here until that time.

Early life  Webb graduated in Mathematics from Exeter College, Oxford in 1986. From 1981 to 1986 he was also an author of books and games for early home computers, particularly the Sinclair ZX Spectrum. He authored the Pac Man type game Spookyman and went on to create the acclaimed 3D Vector graphics game Starion on the Spectrum. After graduation he became an investment banker in London. He moved to Hong Kong in 1991. He retired from investment banking in 1998, and now lobbies extensively for increased transparency and public accountability of directors of public companies as well as for the Government of Hong Kong. Webb was appointed as a Deputy Chairman of the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission's Takeover and Mergers Panel on 1 April 2013, having commenced serving as member on 1 April 2001.  Activism  Webb has been referred to as the \\"'Long Hair' of the financial markets\\" (in an allusion to Leung Kwok-hung), but his activism is not purely restricted to the finance sector. He uses his eponymous webb-site.com as his official mouthpiece on all matters commercial and political. In 2003, he launched \\"Project Poll\\", in which he purchased 10 shares in each of the 33 constituents of the Hang Seng Index, registering them in 5 names (himself, his wife and 3 BVI companies he owned) and used company law to demand poll voting (1 share, 1 vote) rather than a show of hands in all their shareholder meetings. This eventually led to a change of Hong Kong Listing Rules to require poll voting in all companies from 2009 onwards. Also in 2003, he launched Project VAMPIRE (Vote Against Mandate for Placings, Issues by Rights Excepted), to oppose resolutions that allow for massive issues of shares for cash without offering them to existing shareholders, negating pre-emption rights. In December 2005, he advocated widening the electorate of the functional constituencies, arguing that professionals in fields such as bankers and stockbrokers should get to elect their own representatives.\\"Hong Kong Confidential\\", The Standard, 6 December 2005 He observed then that only accountants, lawyers, doctors and teachers are able to exercise that right; stockbrokers are represented by convicted fraudster Chim Pui-chung,Darren Schuettler, Reuters, With friends like these..., The Standard, 23 September 2004 whilst the banking seat has only been contested once in 20 years. During the 2014 Hong Kong protests, he said that the economic impact of the protests was minor compared to the large economic benefits of a more dynamic economy that would come from democracy, ending collusion between the Government and the tycoons who currently elect the Chief executive. = Hong Kong Stock Exchange = Webb argues that there is inherently conflict between the commercial and regulatory roles of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and has been arguing for a super-regulatory authority to assume that role. In the meantime, he argues for improved investor representation on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. He was elected an independent non-executive director of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. in 2003, and was re-elected by a landslide in April 2006. In early 2007, Webb spoke up against the vested interests of smaller local stockbrokers acting against investors' interests, and was the only member to vote against reversing the decision by the former board of directors to cut minimum trading spreads for equities and warrants trading at between 25 HK cents and HK$2. The reforms were to be implemented in the first quarter, but were put back on the table following protests by brokers. In September 2007, the government increased its stake in the Exchange from 4.41% to 5.88%. The Government declared the stake would be held by the Exchange Fund as a \\"strategic asset\\".Benjamin Scent, Exchange Fund boosts stake in HKEx , The Standard, 8 September 2007 Webb remarked that the government was the second-largest single investor in the Hong Kong market after Beijing, with a portfolio of local equities estimated to be worth about HK$150 billion. He said the purchase violated the government's stated principle of \\"big market, small government\\".Benjamin Scent, Exchange face-off , The Standard, 11 September 2007 On top of already having its own appointed directors, the Government exercised its 63 million share-votes on directors' appointments as a shareholder at General Meeting in April 2008. Webb suggested that \\"As a 'strategic' investor, the government shouldn't have voted\\".Katherine Ng, Government role in HKEx directors voting slammed, The Standard, 25 April 2008 In May 2008, Webb resigned one year prior to the expiry of his term as an independent non-executive director, citing backdoor politics by the Government to install a professional board that would exclude retail investors and adopt more flexible standards for new listings; he also slammed the management for withholding information, which the management denies. = Cyberport = The Hospital Hong Kong government's project to develop a business Park called \\"Cyberport\\" was controversially granted to PCCW, controlled by Richard Li, son of Hong Kong's wealthiest man Li Ka-Shing, without the benefit of a formal tender. In October 2004, Webb cited lack of transparency in the government's business dealings and demanded audited financial accounts and directors' reports for three companies related to the project, namely Hong Kong Cyberport Development Holdings Ltd., Hong Kong Cyberport Management Ltd. and Hong Kong Cyberport (Ancillary Development) Ltd., to be released under the non-statutory Code on Access to Information. = Disneyland = In 2005, Webb criticised the government for its lack of accountability, through its refusal to uphold a promise of independent directors on the board of Hong Kong Disneyland. The Hong Kong Government was heavily involved in the project, and is the company's 57% shareholder.  Other work  From 1999 to 2008, Webb made public an annual Christmas share tip where he recommended a single undervalued but well-run company. His picks are believed to have strongly influenced the price of selected stocks. However, The Standard criticised Webb after reporting that he himself owned holdings in his own Christmas share tip (which he had always disclosed), in one case giving himself almost a 40% unrealised profit on his holdings the day following publication of the tip. In December 2009, he announced an end to the \\"Christmas Pick\\" after a 10-year run in which they returned a cumulative 1118%, compared with an 87% return in the Hang Seng Index over that period., saying that the success of the picks \\"has become something of a distraction\\" to the main goal of raising the standards of Hong Kong's corporate and economic governance. Webb was named as a \\"Gadfly\\" in CFO Magazine's Global 100 in 2002.  Personal life  Webb is married to Karen Anne Webb; they have two children together. On 8 June 2020, he announced on his website, webb-site.com, that he has been diagnosed of metastatic prostate cancer and will step back from in-depth research on listed companies.

In 2002 they became double world champions (C-2 200 m and C-2 500 m) in Seville, Spain. They also took the silver medal in the C-2 1000 m final. The pair were voted Cuban Athletes of the Year in recognition of their achievement. In 2003 they won both C-2 finals at the Pan American Games (500 m and 1000 m) and went to the World Championships at Gainesville, USA, as favourites. Unlike their main European rivals they again entered all three C-2 events. They finished fourth in the C-2 500 m, but were awarded bronze after the Russian team was stripped of their silver medals following Sergey Ulegin's doping disqualification. The Cuban pair had had very little recovery time since the Pan-American Games however and, this time, their grueling race schedule took its toll on Rojas and they finished outside the medals. Both men were due to retire after the Athens Olympics and were hopeful of bowing out with a medal. Eighth place in the C-2 1000 m final was a disappointment, but the next day they won the C-2 500m silver medal. Balceiro later decided to continue and switched back to the C-1 event for the 2005 season. He holds the C-1 200 m world record of 38.383 seconds (Seville 2002) References  Category:1975 births Category:Canoeists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Canoeists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Cuban male canoeists Category:Living people Category:Olympic canoeists of Cuba Category:Olympic silver medalists for Cuba Category:Olympic medalists in canoeing Category:ICF Canoe Sprint World Championships medalists in Canadian Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Cuba Category:Pan American Games medalists in canoeing Category:Canoeists at the 2003 Pan American Games ","title":"Ledis Balceiro"},{"id":"4843939","text":"12 Tónar (, twelve tones) is a record shop in Reykjavík, Iceland, and also a record label for Icelandic artists. It is located on Skólavörðustígur 15, in downtown Reykjavík. Founded in 1998 in Reykjavík, 12 Tónar has been well received by music lovers from the start. The store quickly became a meeting point for musicians such as Björk, Sigur Rós, múm, and the core of classical composers and performers. 12 Tónar is also an independent record label with nearly 80 releases in its catalogue. Many of the best musicians in Iceland have released their albums on the label, for example artists and bands such as Mugison, Trabant and Singapore Sling, Apparat Organ Quartet, Pétur Ben, Eivør Pálsdóttir, Ragnheiður Gröndal, Jóhann Jóhannsson, Hildur Guðnadóttir, Skúli Sverrisson, Ólöf Arnalds, Pink Street Boys, Samaris and Jakobínarína, to name a few. In May 2006 12 Tónar opened a record store in Copenhagen, Denmark selling music from their own catalogue of artists as well as other Icelandic music. The store was situated on Fiolstraede 26. The store followed the good example from Iceland, with its friendly atmosphere and freshly brewed espresso for the customers while the music was spinning. It became a tradition with live in-store concerts taking place on Friday afternoons. On 26 January 2008 the Copenhagen store celebrated its closing with a live performance by the Danish band Tremolo Beer Gut. Immediately succeeding the closing of the 12 Tónar record store in Copenhagen a brand new web-shop was introduced, allowing continued access to their family of artists.

Palenque Glyphs that has a total of 92 glyphs on the tablet. Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. It contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. For broader world history, recorded history begins with the accounts of the ancient world around the 4th millennium BC, and coincides with the invention of writing. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals. Recorded history for particular types of information is therefore limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic. The interpretation of recorded history often relies on historical method, or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the philosophy of history as a question of epistemology. The study of different historical methods is known as historiography, which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.  Prehistory  Prehistory traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history, ending with the invention of writing systems.Shotwell, James Thomson. An Introduction to the History of History. Records of civilization, sources and studies. New York: Columbia University Press, 1922. Prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. Protohistory refers to the transition period between prehistory and history, after the advent of literacy in a society but before the writings of the first historians. Protohistory may also refer to the period during which a culture or civilization has not yet developed writing, but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings. More complete writing systems were preceded by proto-writing. Early examples are the Jiahu symbols (c. 6600 BCE), Vinča signs (c. 5300 BCE), early Indus script (c. 3500 BCE) and Nsibidi script (c. before 500 CE). There is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history, and when proto-writing became \\"true writing\\".Smail, Daniel Lord. On Deep History and the Brain. An Ahmanson foundation book in the humanities. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008. However, invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the Bronze Age in the late Neolithic of the late 4th millennium BCE. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto- literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BCE with earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BCE. Historical accounts The earliest chronologies date back to the earliest civilizations of Early Dynastic Period Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Sumerians, which emerged independently of each other from roughly 3500 B.C. Earliest recorded history, which varies greatly in quality and reliability, deals with Pharaohs and their reigns, as preserved by ancient Egyptians. Much of the earliest recorded history was re-discovered relatively recently due to archaeological dig sites findings. A number of different traditions have developed in different parts of the world as to how to interpret these ancient accounts. =Europe= Dionysius of Halicarnassus knew of seven predecessors of Herodotus, including Hellanicus of Lesbos, Xanthus of Lydia and Hecataeus of Miletus. He described their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends. Herodotus (484 B.C. – 425 B.C. ) has generally been acclaimed as the \\"father of history\\" composing his The Histories from the 450s to the 420s B.C. However, his contemporary Thucydides (c. 460 B.C. – c. 400 B.C.) is credited with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the History of the Peloponnesian War. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention. History developed as a popular form of literature in later Greek and Roman societies in the works of Polybius, Tacitus and others. Saint Augustine was influential in Christian and Western thought at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach into historical study. Sumerian inscription in monumental archaic style, c. 26th century B.C. According to John Tosh, \\"From the High Middle Ages (c.1000–1300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history.\\"Tosh, The Pursuit of History, 90. Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to attempt more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the Annales School introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history. =East Asia= The Zuo zhuan, attributed to Zuo Qiuming in the covers the period from in a narrative form. The Book of Documents is one of the Five Classics of Chinese classic texts and one of the earliest narratives of China. The Spring and Autumn Annals, the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from , is arranged on annalistic principles. It is traditionally attributed to Confucius (551–479 B.C.). Zhan Guo Ce was a renowned ancient Chinese historical compilation of sporadic materials on the Warring States period compiled between the . Sima Qian (around ) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the Records of the Grand Historian, a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the , and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the Eastern Han dynasty era. =South Asia= In Sri Lanka, the oldest historical text is the Mahavamsa ( 5th century CE). Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century by the Mahanama of Anuradhapura while Dhatusena of Anuradhapura was ruling the Anuradhapura Kingdom. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the Atthakatha, which were commentaries written in Sinhala. An earlier document known as the Dipavamsa(4th century CE) \\"Island Chronicles\\" is much simpler and contains less information than the Mahavamsa and was probably compiled using the Atthakatha on the Mahavamsa as well. A companion volume, the Culavamsa \\"Lesser Chronicle\\", compiled by Sinhala monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the British takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The Culavamsa was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods. The combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the Mahavamsa, provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts. It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the Nāga and Yakkha peoples, indigenous inhabitants of Lanka prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga. The Sangam literature offers a window into some aspects of the ancient South Indian culture, secular and religious beliefs, and the people. For example, in the Sangam era Ainkurunuru poem 202 is one of the earliest mentions of \\"pigtail of Brahmin boys\\". These poems also allude to historical incidents, ancient Tamil kings, the effect of war on loved ones and households. The Pattinappalai poem in the Ten Idylls group, for example, paints a description of the Chola capital, the king Karikal, the life in a harbor city with ships and merchandise for seafaring trade, the dance troupes, the bards and artists, the worship of the Hindu god Murugan and the monasteries of Buddhism and Jainism. Indica is an account of Mauryan India by the Greek writer Megasthenes. The original book is now lost, but its fragments have survived in later Greek and Latin works. The earliest of these works are those by Diodorus Siculus, Strabo (Geographica), Pliny, and Arrian (Indica). =Middle East= In the preface to his book, the Muqaddimah (1377), the Arab historian and early sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized \\"idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data.\\" As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his \\"new science\\".Ibn Khaldun, Franz Rosenthal, N. J. Dawood (1967), The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History, p. x, Princeton University Press, . His historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state, communication, propaganda and systematic bias in history,H.

Akhtar (1997). \\"The Islamic Concept of Knowledge\\", Al- Tawhid: A Quarterly Journal of Islamic Thought & Culture 12 (3). Methods of recording history While recorded history begins with the invention of writing, over time new ways of recording history have come along with the advancement of technology. History can now be recorded through photography, audio recordings, and video recordings. More recently, Internet archives have been saving copies of webpages, documenting the history of the Internet. Other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies; for example, since at least the 20th century, attempts have been made to preserve oral history by recording it. Until the 1990s this was done using analogue recording methods such as cassettes and reel-to-reel tapes. With the onset of new technologies, there are now digital recordings, which may be recorded to CDs. Nevertheless, historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records, partially because it dominates the extant historical materials, and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.Tosh, The Pursuit of History 58-59 =Historical method= The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history. Primary sources are first-hand evidence of history (usually written, but sometimes captured in other mediums) made at the time of an event by a present person. Historians think of those sources as the closest to the origin of the information or idea under study.\\"Library Guides: Primary, secondary and tertiary sources\\" These types of sources can provide researchers with, as Dalton and Charnigo put it, \\"direct, unmediated information about the object of study.\\", citing U.S. Dept. of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics (2003), Occupational Outlook Handbook; Historians use other types of sources to understand history as well. Secondary sources are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources. These are sources which, usually, are accounts, works, or research that analyse, assimilate, evaluate, interpret, and/or synthesize primary sources. Tertiary sources are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources and often tell a more generalized account built on the more specific research found in the first two types of sources.

Crumb and his Cheap Suit Serenaders are an American retro string band playing songs from, and in the style of, the 1920s: old-time music, ragtime, \\"evergreen\\" jazz standards, western swing, country blues, Hawaiian, hokum, vaudeville and medicine show tunes. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb was the band's frontman and album cover artist. Other members of the band include fellow cartoonist Robert Armstrong and filmmaker Terry Zwigoff (who directed the 1995 documentary Crumb).  History  Crumb and Armstrong, who knew each other from the underground comics scene, realized that they both enjoyed listening to — and playing — music from the 1920s and '30s. Bringing in Armstrong's old friend Al Dodge, the trio began playing together for fun. On a subsequent trip through Milwaukee, the group met with underground publisher Denis Kitchen, who offered them the chance to cut a 78 rpm record under the name R. Crumb and his Keep on Trucking Orchestra (a reference to Crumb's famous Keep on Truckin' comic strip, which itself was a riff on the Blind Boy Fuller song \\"Truckin' My Blues Away\\").Lynch, Megan. \\"The Cheap Suit Serenaders,\\" AllMusic.com. Accessed Nov. 17, 2019. The 78 caught the attention of Blue Goose Records, which offered to produce and release an LP of the band, which had changed its name to the Cheap Suit Serenaders after \\"hurriedly buying suits at the Salvation Army in order to meet the minimum dress code required of the band at a posh wedding.\\" R. Crumb and his Cheap Suit Serenaders released their first album in 1974. Over time, the trio added Dan Wheetman (later of the band Marley's Ghost), Terry Zwigoff on cello, and Tom Marion on guitar and mandolin. In 1978, Tony Marcus replaced Marion. Also in 1978, guitarist Bob Brozman came in for the band's third album. By the mid-1980s, the group played fewer live shows because Armstrong and Crumb had moved out of the Bay Area; by the mid-1990s Crumb had moved to France. As of 2006 R. Crumb was no longer much involved with the group; the band at that time included Robert Armstrong (vocals, musical saw, guitar), Bob Brozman (vocals, various resonator instruments, guitar, ukulele), Al (Allan) Dodge (vocals, mandolin), Terry Zwigoff (saw, cello, Stroh violin, and mandolin), and Tony Marcus (vocals, guitar, and fiddle). Brozman died in 2013; as of 2017, the other members of the group still play annually at the Freight and Salvage, a folk-oriented concert venue in Berkeley, California.  Discography  The band's 33⅓ rpm albums, all recorded in the 1970s on the Blue Goose Records label, were titled R. Crumb and his Cheap Suit Serenaders (1974), R. Crumb and his Cheap Suit Serenaders No. 2 (1976), and R. Crumb and his Cheap Suit Serenaders No. 3 (1978); the latter two were reissued on the Shanachie Records label in 1993 as Chasin' Rainbows and Singing In the Bathtub respectively. As a novelty, the band issued a number of 78 rpm 10-inch singles for Blue Goose, long after the format was obsolete. The most familiar is probably R. Crumb and his Cheap Suit Serenaders' Party Record (1980), with the double-entendre \\"My Girl's Pussy\\" on the \\"A\\" side and X-rated \\"Christopher Columbus\\" on the \\"B\\" side. The band's self-titled debut LP is currently out of print, though the tracks \\"Get a Load of This\\" and \\"Cheap Suit Special\\" were re-released on the R.

Toshinden 3 is the first of the main series not to be ported to other platforms. It is also the only game in the series that has game play differences between the Japanese version and subsequent U.S. and European releases. Gameplay Whereas Toshinden 2 was largely built upon the first game, Toshinden 3 radically changes the series' gameplay. The arenas are now enclosed, allowing players to launch opponents into the walls and ceilings in order to juggle them with further attacks. The combo system has also been reworked, with every character possessing a preset list of combos. As well as the 14 starting fighters, the game also adds 18 unlockable fighters bringing the total to 32, though most of them are largely mirror images of the original 14's fighting styles. Toshinden 3's Arcade Mode is much different from the previous two. The opponents that the player faces depend on their selected character. If the player chooses one of the 14 starting fighters or \\"Heroes\\", then the computer-controlled opponents will eventually be Organization members while choosing an Organization member will have the player facing off against the \\"Heroes\\" themselves. Nagisa and Vermilion serve as the first bosses to their opponents' sides while the specific playing character's sub-boss soon appears next. After that, Sho arrives as the third boss (doubling as the final boss for any Organization member) and once he's defeated, the player will then face off against the Organization leader Abel, who serves as the \\"final\\" boss of the game. The U.S. and European releases of Toshinden 3 feature several game play differences from the original Japanese release including: *Blocking high or low is automatic; pressing back blocks both block high and low attacks. In the Japanese version one had to press back and down to block low attacks. *When hit by a reversal attack, all characters fly the full length of the arena. In the Japanese version, A.I. opponents fly the full length of the arena, but how far the player character flies is determined by his or her weight. *Practice and Survival modes were added. *A bug regarding the direction a character flies when hit by attacks that send them flying across the arena, when they were facing away from their attacker, was fixed. * The forward distance a character moves while being hurt from Vermillion's over drive was decreased to match the backward distance, to prevent them slowly moving toward Vermillion during the move. Plot With the Secret Society, the sponsors of the two previous Battle Arena Toshinden tournaments, finally defeated, it would soon transpire and be known that the Secret Society's long-time rival criminal group, the Organization, who have been observing both tournaments from the shadows, are now ready and prepared to make their own move in having to bring forth the destructive fighting god, Agon Teos, into the world. The Organization's leader, Abel, requires the sacrificial blood of the world's strongest warriors and through the knowledge of his loyal agent, Vermilion, Abel organizes and sponsors a third Battle Arena Toshinden tournament in order to lure Eiji Shinjo and his fellow Toshinden fighters out in the open while pitting them against his own chosen warriors, who have copied and learned their specific targets' respective fighting styles. Furthermore, Abel targets a young English boy named David as he seeks to use him as a potential human vessel for Agon Teos. Managing to escape from the relentless pursuit of the Organization, David is soon saved and rescued by a young Japanese female gambler named Shizuku Fuji and in due time, both David and Shizuku enter the tournament in order to help aid Eiji and the rest of the Toshinden fighters against the Organization. Eiji and the Toshinden fighters progress through the tournament and defeat their chosen rivals, during which a few storyline developments occur and happen from within the competition, such as Organization members Atahua and Tau forfeiting their matches to both Ellis and Gaia (with Atahua learning and understanding from Tau that the murder of a fighter couldn't justify the means of restoring an ancient empire), Tracy sparing the life of her vengeful older twin sister Rachael, who had refused Tracy's offer of starting over with her and walking away from her to never be seen again, and Organization member Cuiling switching sides in order to help Eiji and the rest of the Toshinden fighters out after killing Bayhou and avenging Fo Fai's past death while also realizing that Abel had to be stopped before he could succeed in bringing Agon Teos to the world. Eiji comes face- to-face once again with Vermilion and overcomes the assassin before finally encountering his long-lost older brother, Sho. The two battle and Eiji wins, with Sho complimenting his brother's skills before leaving. Eiji soon faces and slays Abel in single combat, but at the same time, accidentally frees the Organization's previous leader, Veil, who was betrayed and usurped by Abel long ago. Robbed of his revenge, Veil battles Eiji but is also killed as well. With the deaths of both Veil and Abel, the Organization is completely destroyed and the world is miraculously saved from the malevolent wrath of Agon Teos. However, Eiji soon discovers that Vermilion had somehow survived and escaped the Organization's destruction while completely disappearing without a trace. Faced with an enticing offer, Eiji starts his own plan in order to lure Vermilion out for a final battle. Characters *Eiji Shinjo *Kayin Amoh *Sofia *Rungo Iron *Mondo *Duke B.

He cited the single-round combat, super moves, enclosed arenas, and character unlocking, and concluded, \\"If you were one of the many who thought Toshinden was neat, but far too dull, this game may have what it takes to turn your viewpoint around.\\" In contrast, Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly saw Battle Arena Toshinden 3 as a rush-job, noting how quickly it had come out after Toshinden 2. While he agreed that the character unlocking is a good feature, he argued that the enclosed arenas in effect sacrificed the strategic element of ring-outs for the lesser trade-off of improved frame rate. He and his three co-reviewers all commented that the game is flashy but shallow, with unbalanced characters and overly easy-to-execute super moves. Scary Larry of GamePro gave Battle Arena Toshinden 3 a score of 3.5 out of 5 within all four categories (control, sound, graphics, and fun factor), stating that while the game was better than Toshinden 2, \\"it's still not good enough to be classed with Tekken, Virtua Fighter 2, or even Tobal No. 1.\\" His critiques included the game's simple gameplay, one-button special moves, slowdown which affected the game's continuity, and that \\"the fighters, although unique in appearance, are too similar in their fighting styles.\\" He concluded that Toshinden 3 wasn't a bad game, but couldn't compete with the other fighting games available for the PlayStation.

At least 57 people were killed, including 10 children.  Overview  Mexican pilgrims were being transported from Guadalajara to Mexico City after they had attended a religious festival in the Northern city. Their 22-year-old bus had already been travelling for ten hours when police say it apparently developed a fault, probably with its brakes. The bus was descending a highway on a steep hill at over 70 miles per hour. The driver attempted to manoeuvre into an emergency hard shoulder but lost control, sending the bus rolling down a ravine which bordered the road. The bus fell approximately 650 feet into the stream bed below, crashing into the hillside several times as it descended. The bus was well over its capacity of 46, carrying at least 60 passengers. 57 of those were killed in the impact, and the three survivors were all very seriously injured. Initial reports said that there had been 71 passengers on the bus and 63 had died, but these numbers were scaled back as bodies were identified and several critically injured people died in the rescue operation. The police believe that the bus's brakes were faulty, having not been serviced properly in many years, and that the driver was driving much too fast for the dangerous road, which is a well known accident black spot, owing to the lack of crash barriers. The owner of the company which supplied the bus was taken in for questioning by Mexican police.

People must be aware of the problem and have the opportunity to act. * Structural strain – there must be a strain on society, caused by factors related to the structure of the current social system, such as inequality or injustice, and existing power holders are unable (or unwilling) to address the problem (see also relative deprivation). * Generalized belief – the problem should be clearly defined in a way that is agreed by and understood by the participants. See also: framing. * Precipitating factors – events that become the proverbial spark igniting the flame, in other words a political opportunity. * Mobilization for action – people need to have a network and organization allowing them to take a collective action, see also resource mobilization * Operation (failure) of social control – how the authorities react (or don't). High level of social control by those in control of power (politicians, police) often makes it more difficult for social movements to act. The concept of value added was used earlier in economics, where it refers to the increasing value of product in progressing stages of production. Critics of this theory note that it is too focused on the structural-functional approach and views all strains on society as disruptive.

Pythion is shown to the centre top near Mount Olympus. Pythion () or Pythium, also Pythoion (Πύθοιον) was a city and polis (city-state) of Perrhaebia in ancient Thessaly, situated at the foot of Mount Olympus, and forming a Tripolis with the two neighbouring towns of Azorus and Doliche. Pythion derived its name from a temple of Apollo Pythius situated on one of the summits of Olympus, as we learn from an epigram of Xeinagoras, a Greek mathematician, who measured the height of Olympus from these parts.ap. Plut. Aemil. Paul. 15. Games were also celebrated here in honour of Apollo. Geography Pythion commanded an important pass across Mount Olympus. This pass and that of Tempe are the only two leading from Macedonia into the northeast of Thessaly. History During the reign of Amyntas III or Philip II, the Tripolis was annexed to Macedon. According to Theagenes the inhabitants of Balla were relocated to Pythion. So we find in 3rd century BC an epigram regarding Philarchos son of Hellanion, Macedonian Elimiote from Pythion, proxenos in Delphi.FD III 4:417City and sanctuary in ancient Greece: the Theorodokia in the Peloponnese By Paula Jean Perlman Page 127 During the Roman–Seleucid War, the Tripolis was ravaged by an army of Aetolians in the year 191 BCE During the Third Macedonian War the three towns surrendered to the army of Perseus of Macedon in the year 171 BCE, but that same year the Romans reconquered the three. In the year 169 BCE troops arrived from the Roman consul Quintus Marcius Philippus who camped between Azorus and Doliche. The three cities minted a common coin with the inscription \\"ΤΡΙΠΟΛΙΤΑΝ\\".

It follows on from Arrow in the Blue, published a mere two years earlier, and which described his life from his birth in 1905, to 1931, and deals with a much shorter period, a mere eight years (as opposed to the twenty six of the previous volume). This was nonetheless, a highly significant period in Koestler's life, as it involved his membership and subsequent alienation from the Communist movement. As well as his relationship with Communism, The Invisible Writing is also interesting for its documentation of Europe in the years leading up to World War II, both his native Hungary and Austria, Germany, and also the west, such as Spain, France and England. In The Invisible Writing, Koestler recalls that during the summer of 1935 he \\"wrote about half of a satirical novel called The Good Soldier Schweik Goes to War Again..... It had been commissioned by Willy Münzenberg [the Comintern's chief propagandist in the West ... but was vetoed by the Party on the grounds of the book's 'pacifist errors'...\\" (p. 283). Much of the experiences in this book, were also to be found in some form elsewhere: * Koestler's incarceration in the Spanish Civil War, by the Phalange - documented in Spanish Testament (1937), and revised 1942 as Dialogue with Death, and which formed part of the basis for his novel Darkness at Noon (1940). * Scum of the Earth was a very lightly fictionalised account of his detention at Camp Vernet, and subsequent escape in the pre-World War II period. * Koestler's experiences with Communism were also discussed by him in the anti-Communist The God that Failed (1949), which collected the testimonies of several ex-Communists. * Von Weissen Nächten und Roten Tagen (\\"From White Nights and Red Days\\"), published in 1933, also recounts some of the early period of this book. It is very difficult to find, being mostly published in the Soviet Union, and long out of print. It is nonetheless significant as Koestler's first published book.

He is also known under stage names Aggressor, Czral and Exhurtum. Biography Carl-Michael Eide has played in various black metal and avant-garde metal bands. These include Ved Buens Ende, Aura Noir, Cadaver, Dødheimsgard, Satyricon, Ulver, Infernö and recently the jazz/rock band Virus. His drumming is unusual in style, with very little repetition and a tendency to shy away from traditional drumming. His singing abilities are diverse. Other than usual harsh vocals in black metal, he uses a form of croon in the avant-garde metal bands Ved Buens Ende and Virus. He has gone back to playing guitar and was writing music for the re-grouped Ved Buens Ende, before the band once again split up in early 2007. Beyond that, he continues to write material for Aura Noir and Virus. He was also a session drummer for Dimmu Borgir on their 1997 tour. On 26 March 2005 he fell from a four-story building and was hospitalized for several months. He has lost the use of his feet as a result of the incident. He is not able to play drums anymore, but is still active as a vocalist, guitarist and bassist.

History When Turner Ashby High School opened in the fall of 1956, it became the third consolidated high school in Rockingham County. Schools consolidated were Bridgewater, Dayton, and Mt. Clinton. The original Turner Ashby building was located on a twenty-acre plot on the north side of Dayton, and now serves grades six through eight as Wilbur S. Pence Middle School. The name Turner Ashby High School was selected by the Rockingham County School Board because of the school’s location in the Ashby District of the county. The Ashby District was named for General Turner Ashby, a native of Fauquier County, who served as cavalry commander for Stonewall Jackson for the first year of the American Civil War. Ashby was killed in battle near Harrisonburg just prior to Jackson's victories at Cross Keys and Port Republic and the culmination of the 1862 Valley Campaign. The original building was designed and constructed for grades eight through twelve. The approximate cost of the school was $1,000,000.00. Classroom additions were added in 1960 and 1962. Mobile units were added for classroom use in 1973, 1975, and 1980. Also, beginning in 1966, the eighth grade was moved to the John Wayland Intermediate School, now John Wayland Elementary School. Turner Ashby High School moved into its new and present facility on Route 42 north of Bridgewater in the fall of 1989. The new facility, including site development, furnishings, building, etc. was built for approximately $15,300,000.00. This modern facility has more cafeteria, music, athletic, storage, and classroom areas designed to serve up to 1200 students. Three mobile units were added for classroom use in 1998, and five more were added in 2000. During the 2001-2002 school year and the following summer, a new wing was added to the 1989 building. This addition added 20+ new classrooms including 4 new science rooms and another general purpose computer lab. Along with the addition of the new wing, the library was expanded and a girls’ team room was added. Principals *F. N. Postlethwait - 1956-1961 *W. Carl Yowell - 1961-1964 *E.

As a teenager, Pitol moved to Córdoba, Veracruz.  Education and diplomatic work  In 1950, Pitol moved to Mexico City to study law and literature at the Universidad Autónoma de México (UNAM). In 1960, he became a member of the Mexican Foreign Service and served over a number of years as cultural attaché in Rome, Belgrade, Warsaw, Paris, Beijing, Moscow, Prague, Budapest and Barcelona. In the 1980s, he served as ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Later years Since 1993, he lived in Xalapa, capital of the state of Veracruz, where he taught at the Universidad Veracruzana.

It is located in the Volturno valley, and is a flourishing centre of agricultural production. History =Ancient history= The name of Alife has Samnite origin, although a settlement in the hills around the city existed probably since the Iron Age. After the First Punic War, it became a Roman municipium, with the name of Alliphae - the ruins of which extend to the nearby comune of Sant'Angelo d'Alife. =Later history= A bishopric was present in Alife in the 5th century, but in the following century it disappeared. The city was a Lombard possession, as part of the Duchy of Benevento and, later, of the Principality of Capua. The bishop was reinstated in 969, four years after the city became an independent county. In 1132, the Norman Count Ranulf (one of the most outstanding military leaders of medieval Italy) began the construction of Alife Cathedral. At this time, Alife, together with other centers of northern Campania, was almost independent from Capua, and began governing itself. This, of course, caused increasing strife with the central power of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily (created by Roger II in 1130). In 1135, the city was occupied by Sicilian troops; but, two years later, Count Ranulf had his vengeance, obtaining the title of Duke. However, in 1138, the city was again captured, largely destroyed and occupied by a Sicilian contingent. In 1169, the counts obtained again autonomy; in 1178, the city was handed over to Richard Caetani of Fondi. The Quarrel family returned in 1191, after the descent of Emperor Henry VI, but was ousted forever in 1197, and the city assigned to the German family of Schweisspeunt. Alife was subsequently ruled by several baronial families of the Kingdom of Naples, who did little to improve its conditions. The neighbouring area became increasingly marshy, and the city decayed, being almost wholly abandoned after the 14th century. Many of the citizens took refuge in the surrounding hills. In 1561, the Spanish king Philip II had the city destroyed to punish its seigneur, Ferrante II Diaz Garlon, who had had a part in the assassination of the king's sister. The cathedral collapsed in the 1688 earthquake. Alife started to recover only after the abolition of feudalism in 1806; in 1861 it became part of the newly formed Kingdom of Italy. The Roman amphitheatre, still partially covered by earth. Main sights Alife's main attractions include: *The Roman amphitheatre, still partially covered by earth: with dimensions of , it was the fourth largest in Italy after those of Rome, Pompeii and Capua. *The Mausoleum of Acilii Glabriones, outside the city walls. Other Roman tombs, including a great Tower (the so-called Torrione) can be seen on State Route SS.158. One has been turned into the church of Madonna delle Grazie. *The Roman Cryptoporticum, a well-preserved gallery more than long. *The Castle, which probably existed before Lombard times, though the first records of it date from 1127. *Alife Cathedral (1132). After the severe earthquakes of 1456 and 1688, it was largely rebuilt in Baroque style and reopened in 1692. The interior has maintained noteworthy elements of the Lombard-Norman edifice, including two arcades decorated with sculptures of animals (including the elephant, heraldic symbol of the city established by the d'Aquino family, who ruled Alife from 1221 to 1269) and saints. Also interesting is the Romanesque crypt, which houses the relics of Pope Sixtus I, brought here by Rainulf III: it has a rectangular plan and columns from the ancient Roman theater. Some of the capitals are ancient, while others are mediaeval copies of the Roman originals. Transportation The town counts a railway station on the Alifana Railway line Santa Maria Capua Vetere-Piedimonte Matese. It is linked with regional trains to the main stations of Caserta and Napoli Centrale.

Doliche, with the two neighbouring towns of Azorus and Pythion (Pythium), formed a Tripolis. During the Roman–Seleucid War, the Tripolis was ravaged by an army of the Aetolian League in the year 191 BCE. During the Third Macedonian War the three towns surrendered to the army of Perseus of Macedon in the year 171 BCE, but that same year the Romans reconquered the three. In the year 169 BCE troops arrived from the Roman consul Quintus Marcius Philippus who camped between Azorus and Doliche. The three cities minted a common coin with the inscription \\"ΤΡΙΠΟΛΙΤΑΝ\\".

David, born about 1550, was the son of James de Barry, 4th Viscount Buttevant and the Lady Ellen MacCarthy Reagh, illegitimate daughter of Cormac na Haoine MacCarthy Reagh, 10th Prince of Carbery. He married firstly the Lady Ellen Roche, daughter of David Roche, 5th Viscount Roche of Fermoy, by the Lady Ellen Butler, daughter of James Butler, 10th Baron Dunboyne. From this marriage were born the Lady Margaret Barry who subsequently married Sir Dermot O'Shaughnessy as her first husband; the Lady Ellen Barry who subsequently married John Fitzgerald of Ballymaloe; the Lady Helen Barry who married Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde; and the Honourable David Fitz-David Barry who predeceased his father. He married secondly, Julia MacCarthy, daughter of Cormac MacCarthy and Joan Butler. At the outbreak of the Desmond Rebellions, his father, the then Viscount Buttevant, supported the rebels and in the subsequent confiscations of his estates, the friary in Buttevant, together with its glebe, passed into the hands of the poet, Edmund Spenser. He was noted for his long and bitter feud with Sir Florence MacCarthy, the MacCarthy Mór, whose loyalty to the Crown was always suspect. De Barry did great damage to his reputation by spreading rumours about MacCarthy's alleged acts of treason, in particular his links with Patrick O'Collun whom MacCarthy had once employed as a fencing master. In 1594 O'Collun was executed for conspiracy to kill Queen Elizabeth I. As a result, MacCarthy spent much of his later life in custody. In 1601, during the Nine Years War the viscount sided with the new President of Munster, Sir George Carew. In the wake of the Battle of Kinsale, he was granted large estates in Munster which had been forfeited by the MacCarthys. He died at Barryscourt Castle 10 April 1617. His title and estate passed to his grandson, who became 1st Earl of Barrymore in 1628.

Section 61 states that \\"[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this subtitle, gross income means all income from whatever source derived [ . . . ]\\". The United States Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean that Congress intended to express its full power to tax incomes to the extent that such taxation is permitted under Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 (the Taxing and Spending Clause) of the Constitution of the United States and under the Constitution's Sixteenth Amendment. Scope Section 61 contains a rare example of intensive redundancy, or emphatic redundancy, in the Internal Revenue Code. That is, the parenthetical phrase \\"but not limited to\\" redundantly intensifies the significance of the phrase \\"all income\\" and the phrase \\"from whatever source derived.\\" Under ordinary rules of statutory construction the list of specific items of income would not, even in the absence of the parenthetical intensive, be considered a complete list of all items of income included in \\"gross income\\" under the definition. The use of the word \\"including\\" also highlights this expansive definition of \\"gross income.\\" Under Internal Revenue Code , \\"[t]he terms 'includes' and 'including' when used in a definition contained in this title shall not be deemed to exclude other things otherwise within the meaning of the term defined.\\" Under the 1959 U.S. Supreme Court case of Sims v. United States, the terms \\"includes\\" and \\"including\\" in section 7701 are terms of expansion, not terms of exclusivity. The phrase \\"except as otherwise provided in this subtitle\\" generally refers to the items of income that are excluded from \\"gross income\\" under Internal Revenue Code provisions such as sections 101 through 140. For example, excludes certain life insurance proceeds received by reason of the death of the insured. excludes certain gifts and inheritances. excludes interest income on state and municipal bonds. excludes certain amounts received on account of injuries or sickness. Types of § 61 income Section 61 lists examples of items that are taxable under the Code, including \\"Compensation for services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items\\"; \\"Gross income derived from business\\"; and \\"Gains derived from dealings in property\\". Other examples of income listed in section 61 include interest and dividends, rent, royalty payments, alimony payments; life insurance, pensions, and inheritances. Eligible sources of gross income may be located in section 861. =Compensation for services= Income from Compensation for services include fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and similar items. The employer may also compensate the employee-taxpayer indirectly. A taxpayer may receive taxable income from the taxpayer's employer when the employer pays the taxpayer's taxes. In 1929, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner.. The employer paid incomes taxes on behalf of an employee, and the Court questioned whether that payment constituted additional taxable income to the employee. The Court decided that the payment constituted income to the employee because \\"the discharge by a third person of an obligation to him is equivalent to receipt by the person taxed.\\" Thus, even when a taxpayer does not directly receive compensation for services, the compensation may be considered gross income if the payment releases the taxpayer from an obligation. The issue of whether indirect payments for services should be included in gross income arose again in McCann v. United States.McCann v. United States, 81-2 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9689 (Ct. Cl. 1981), aff'd, 696 F.2d 1386, 83-1 U.S. Tax Cas. (CCH) ¶ 9153 (Fed. Cir. 1983). In McCann, the court had to decide whether travel expenses paid by an employer to enable an employee to attend a company conference were part of the employee's gross income. The company provided the travel award to the employee for good work in increasing net sales during 1972. The court held that the travel expenses were compensation to the employee for services rendered to the company during 1972 and should be included in gross income. Therefore, when a company pays travel expenses, a taxpayer must include such compensation in gross income when the excursion is viewed as a reward for outstanding employee success within the company. Similar to McCann, the issue in United States v. Gotcher involved an expense- paid trip. The employer paid for the employee to travel to Germany to induce the employee to undertake further business endeavors. The court held that the employee's expenses paid by the employer were not gross income because the \\"indirect economic gain [to the employee was] subordinate to an overall business purpose.\\" However, the court found that the employee's wife, who accompanied her husband on the trip, incurred gross income because the wife's trip was primarily a vacation. As such, a taxpayer does not acquire gross income from an expense-paid trip provided by the employer when the primary and overall purpose relates to business interests. =Business income= Gross income derived from business =Discharge of Indebtedness= One form of income listed in the Code, that of \\"discharge of indebtedness\\" is not often considered income by lay persons. If, however, a taxpayer owes a debt to any other party, and that debt is forgiven without being fully repaid, the taxpayer must as a general rule declare the forgiven amount as income, and must pay tax on it.This provision does not apply to debts where the amount is unsettled, or to certain debts in bankruptcy, insolvency and certain other limited situations. For example, suppose John claims to be owed $100,000 by Bill, based on a personal injury suffered by John that was caused by Bill. Suppose also that Bill insists that he owes John only $500. If they agree to settle the dispute for $700, Bill (the taxpayer) has not been relieved of any debt that was clearly owed. =Passive income= capital gain, interest and dividends, royalty payments =Other= life insurance, alimony payments, pensions, and inheritances, rent See also *Internal Revenue Service *Taxation in the United States *Zarin v.

Born in Belfast, Kennedy played as a youth for Belfast Celtic before joining Glentoran in 1915. He moved to England in 1920, joining London side Crystal Palace in 1920; he played a solitary Division Three South game for them before moving across the city to join Arsenal as a reserve full back in August 1922. Soon after joining Arsenal, Kennedy stepped up to the first team after Arthur Hutchins was dropped, and made his debut against Birmingham on December 2, 1922. He impressed enough that he played all but one of the Gunners' remaining games that season, and gained international recognition, winning two caps for Ireland in their 1923 British Home Championship campaign. After injury wrecked his 1923-24 season – Kennedy missed the start of the season, and after returning was dropped from the side after Arsenal lost 6–1 to Huddersfield Town – he played all but one of Arsenal's League matches the following season (as Arsenal narrowly avoided relegation). However, he did not find favour under Herbert Chapman, who first switched Bob John back into defence, and then signed Horace Cope during 1925-26 as a replacement for Kennedy. However, Cope was injured before Arsenal's first FA Cup final, meaning Kennedy started the match, against Cardiff City; however, a mistake by Dan Lewis meant Arsenal lost 1–0, and Kennedy only walked away with a runners- up medal. Kennedy only played two more matches for Arsenal, both of them heavy defeats (5-1 and 4-0). Displeased with his team's defence, Chapman had a clearout at Arsenal, and Kennedy was sold to Everton in January 1928. In all, Kennedy had played 129 matches for Arsenal. Everton won the First Division championship that season but Kennedy was only a reserve player that season. After a solitary League appearance for Everton, he moved on to Tranmere Rovers that summer, playing there for two seasons until his retirement in 1930. He died in 1963, aged 66.

At the north end of Bedford, Trunk 2 takes the Rocky Lake Drive northeast to Waverley where it then turns north (as a continuation of the Waverley Road) along the eastern shore of Lake Thomas. It passes through Fall River and continues along the eastern shore of Fletchers Lake as it passes through Fletchers Lake. It continues along the eastern shore of Shubenacadie Grand Lake and passes through Wellington Station, Wellington, Grand Lake Station and Oakfield before turning slightly northeast to enter the Shubenacadie Valley. It enters Hants County at Enfield where it crosses to the west bank of the Shubenacadie River. The highway follows the west side of the Shubenacadie Valley through Elmsdale, Lantz and Milford Station to the village of Shubenacadie where it crosses to the east bank of the Shubenacadie River and enters Colchester County. It climbs out of the Shubenacadie Valley and passes by the town of Stewiacke and the rural community of Brookfield, the suburb of Hilden and the Millbrook First Nation before entering the town of Truro. In Truro, Trunk 2 follows Willow Street and then Prince Street West (co-signed for Trunk 4), then Juniper Street and Robie Street to the interchange with Highway 102 in Lower Truro. Trunk 2/4 follows Highway 102 for 1 kilometre to the north, crossing the Salmon River between exits 14 and 14A to Onslow and then continues as a local road heading west from Onslow along the north shore of Cobequid Bay through Masstown and Glenholme, where Trunk 2 and 4 separate. From Glenholme, Trunk 2 continues west along the north shore of the Minas Basin through Great Village, Bass River, Economy, and Five Islands forming parts of the Glooscap Trail and Fundy Shore Ecotour. At the town of Parrsboro, Trunk 2 turns north through the Cobequid Hills to Newville Lake before turning northeast to reach the Southampton River, which Trunk 2 follows to the town of Springhill. Trunk 2 turns northwest from Springhill and runs a further 30 km to the town of Amherst which it passes through until it reaches the rural community of Fort Lawrence on the interprovincial boundary with New Brunswick.  History  The section of Trunk 2 between Springhill and Little Forks was once Trunk 26 prior to 1938. Trunk 26 then turns left on Little Forks Rd and ends in Athol. At this time, Trunk 2 took a more westerly route, running through Athol and Nappan. This old alignment of Trunk 2 is currently Collector Highway 302. Before the 1960s, Trunk 4 was co-signed with Trunk 2 from Amherst to Springhill.

This article covers information gathered by the Opportunity rover during the initial phase of its mission. Information on science gathered by Spirit can be found mostly in the Spirit rover article. The unmanned Mars exploration mission, commenced in 2003 sent two robotic rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, to explore the Martian surface and geology. The mission was led by Project Manager Peter Theisinger of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Principal Investigator Steven Squyres, professor of astronomy at Cornell University. Primary among the mission's scientific goals is to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils that hold clues to past water activity on Mars. In recognition of the vast amount of scientific information amassed by both rovers, two asteroids have been named in their honor: 37452 Spirit and 39382 Opportunity. On January 24, 2014, NASA reported that current studies on the planet Mars by the Curiosity and Opportunity rovers will now be searching for evidence of ancient life, including a biosphere based on autotrophic, chemotrophic or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms, as well as ancient water, including fluvio-lacustrine environments (plains related to ancient rivers or lakes) that may have been habitable. The search for evidence of habitability, taphonomy (related to fossils), and organic carbon on the planet Mars is now a primary NASA objective. Water hypothesis On March 2, 2004, NASA announced that \\"Opportunity has landed in an area of Mars where liquid water once drenched the surface\\". Associate administrator Ed Weiler told reporters that the area \\"would have been good habitable environment\\", although no traces of life have been found. Larger grains suggest the presence of fluid. This statement was made during a press conference, where mission scientists listed a number of observations that strongly support this view: *Distributions of spherules :Hypothesis: Spherules are concretions created in water as a solvent. :Competing hypothesis: Spherules are rehardened molten rock droplets, created by volcanoes or meteor strikes. :Supporting data: Location of spherules in the rock matrix is random and evenly spread. :Quote from Steve Squyres: \\"The little spherules like blueberries in a muffin are embedded in this rock and weathering out of it. Three ideas, lapilli, little volcanic hailstones, one possibility. Two, droplets of volcanic glass or impact. We've looked at these things very carefully. Probably concretions. If so, it's pointing towards water.\\" Detailed analysis of environmental, chemical, and mineralogical data taken from the Opportunity rover led to the elimination of the competing hypotheses, and the confirmation of the conclusion that the spherules were formed in place as post-depositional sedimentary concretions from an aqueous source In the lower left, a spherule can be seen penetrating the interior of a vug. *Vugs :Hypothesis: Rock was formed in water, for instance by precipitation. :Competing hypothesis: Rock were formed by ash deposits. :Supporting data: Voids found in bedrock resemble \\"vugs\\" which are left by eroded away, disk-shaped crystals, possibly dissolved in a watery environment. :Quote from Steve Squyres: The second piece of evidence is that when we looked at it close-up, it was shot through with tabular holes. Familiar forms. When crystals grow within rocks, precipitated from water. If they're tabular, as they grow you can get tabular crystals and water chem changes and they go away or they weather away.\\" *Sulfates and jarosite :Hypothesis: Water created tell-tale salt chemicals in the rock. :Competing hypothesis: Chemistry of rocks is determined by volcanic processes. :Supporting data: Sulfate salts and jarosite mineral were found in the rock. On Earth they are made in standing water (possibly during evaporation). :Quote from Steve Squyres: \\"Next piece of evidence comes from APXS. We found it looked like a lot of sulfur. That was the outside of the rock. We brought with us a grinding tool, the RAT and we ground away 2-4 mm and found even more sulfur. Too much to explain by other than that this rock is full of sulfate salts. That's a telltale sign of liquid water. Mini-TES also found evidence of sulfate salts. Most compelling of all, the Mössbauer spectrometer in the RATted space showed compelling evidence of jarosite, an iron-(III) sulfate basic hydrate. Fairly rare, found on Earth and had been predicted that it might be found on Mars some day. This is a mineral that you got to have water around to make.\\" Crossbedding features in rock \\"Last Chance\\". On March 23, 2004, NASA announced that they believe that Opportunity had not landed in a location merely \\"drenched in water\\", but on what was once a coastal area. \\"We think Opportunity is parked on what was once the shoreline of a salty sea on Mars,\\" said Dr. Steve Squyres of Cornell University. The announcement was based on evidence of sedimentary rocks that are consistent with those formed by water and not wind. \\"Bedding patterns in some finely layered rocks indicate the sand-sized grains of sediment that eventually bonded together were shaped into ripples by water at least five centimeters (two inches) deep, possibly much deeper, and flowing at a speed of 10 to 50 centimeters (four to 20 inches) per second,\\" said Dr. John Grotzinger, from MIT. The landing site was likely a salt flat on the edge of a large body of water that was covered by shallow water. Other evidence includes findings of chlorine and bromine in the rocks which indicates the rocks had at least soaked in mineral-rich water, possibly from underground sources, after they formed. Increased assurance of the bromine findings strengthens the case that rock-forming particles precipitated from surface water as salt concentrations climbed past saturation while water was evaporating. The evidence for water was published in a series of scientific papers, with the initial results appearing in the journal Science and then with a detailed discussion of the sedimentary geology of the landing site appearing in a special issue of the journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters  Spherules and hematite  Early in the mission, mission scientists were able to prove that the abundant spherules at Eagle crater were the source of hematite in the area discovered from orbit. = Hematite = The distribution of hematite in Sinus Meridiani, where Meridiani Planum is located. Geologists were eager to reach a hematite-rich area (in the center of the picture at right) to closely examine the soil, which may reveal secrets about how the hematite got to this location. Knowing how the hematite on Mars was formed may help scientists characterize the past environment and determine whether that environment provided favorable conditions for life. \\"Grey hematite is a mineral indicator of past water,\\" said Dr. Joy Crisp, JPL project scientist. \\"It is not always associated with water, but it often is.\\" Scientists have wanted to find out which of these processes created grey hematite on Mars since 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor spotted large concentrations of the mineral near the planet's equator (seen in the right picture). This discovery provided the first mineral evidence that Mars' history may have included water. \\"We want to know if the grains of hematite appear to be rounded and cemented together by the action of liquid water or if they're crystals that grew from a volcanic melt,\\" said Crisp. \\"Is the hematite in layers, which would suggest that it was laid down by water, or in veins in the rock, which would be more characteristic of water having flowed through the rocks.\\" The next picture shows a mineral map, the first ever made on the surface of another planet, which was generated from a section of the panorama picture overlaid with data taken from the rover's Mini-TES. The Mini-TES spectral data was analyzed in a way that the concentration of the mineral hematite was deduced and its level coded in color. Red and orange mean high concentration, green and blue low concentration. This spectral map of Eagle crater shows hematite. The next picture shows a hematite abundance \\"index map\\" that helps geologists choose hematite-rich locations to visit around Opportunity's landing site. Blue dots equal areas low in hematite and red dots equal areas high in hematite. The colored dots represent data collected by the miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer on Sol 11, after Opportunity had rolled off of the lander and the rover was located at the center of the blue semicircle (the spectrometer is located on the panoramic camera mast). A hematite abundance index map of Eagle crater. The area to the left (with high concentration of hematite) was selected by mission members for further investigation, and called Hematite Slope. During Sol 23 (February 16) Opportunity successfully trenched the soil at Hematite Slope and started to investigate the details of the layering. =Spherules= This color-enhanced image shows spherical granules. Microscopic images of the soil taken by Opportunity revealed small spherically shaped granules. They were first seen on pictures taken on Sol 10, right after the rover drove from the lander onto martian soil. When Opportunity dug her first trench (Sol 23), pictures of the lower layers showed similar round spherules. But this time they had a very shiny surface that created strong glints and glares. \\"They appear shiny or polished,\\" said Albert Yen, science team member, during a press conference on February 19. He said: \\"Data will hopefully help us figure out what's altering them.\\" At the same press briefing, Dr. Squyres noted this as one of the main question: \\"Where did those spherules come from, dropped from above or grown in place?\\" Mission scientists reported on March 2 that they concluded a survey of the distribution of spherules in the bedrock. They found that they spread out evenly and randomly inside the rocks, and not in layers. This supports the notion that they grew in place, since if their origin was related to volcanic or meteoric episodes one would expect layers of spherules as a \\"record in time\\" for each event. This observation was added to the list of evidence for liquid water being present at this rock site, where it is thought the spherules formed. =Berry Bowl= The rock \\"Berry Bowl\\". On March 18 the results of the investigation of the area called \\"Berry Bowl\\" was announced. This site is a large rock with a small, bowl-shaped depression, in which a large number of spherules had accumulated. The MIMOS II Mössbauer spectrometer was used to analyze the depression and then the area of the rock right beside it. Any difference in the measured data was then attributed to the material in the spherules. A large difference in the obtained \\"spectra\\" was found. \\"This is the fingerprint of hematite, so we conclude that the major iron-bearing mineral in the berries is hematite,\\" said Daniel Rodionov, a rover science team collaborator from the University of Mainz, Germany. This discovery seems to strengthen the conclusion, that spherules are concretions, grown in wet condition with dissolved iron. Rocks and minerals The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of basalt. They contain the minerals olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs). Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks. Fairly high levels of nickel were found in some soils; probably from meteorites. Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe bromine compounds. All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder rinds of material. One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT). There are a variety of rocks in the Columbia Hills (Mars), some of which have been altered by water, but not by very much water. The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, Spirit found the magnetism was caused by the mineral magnetite, especially magnetite that contained the element titanium. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic. The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like Tharsis and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water. =Plains= Observations of rocks on the plains show they contain the minerals pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite. These rocks can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts—also called picritic basalts. The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic komatiites. Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic shergottites, meteorites which came from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lay near the junction of basalt, picrobasalt, and tephrite. The Irvine- Barager classification calls them basalts. Plain's rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds. It is thought that small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing mineralization processes. Coatings on the rocks may have occurred when rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust. One sign that they were altered was that it was easier to grind these rocks compared to the same types of rocks found on Earth. The first rock that Spirit studied was Adirondack. It turned out to be typical of the other rocks on the plains. Image:Spirit's First Color Photograph Mars.jpgFirst color picture from Gusev crater. Rocks were found to be basalt. Everything was covered with a fine dust that Spirit determined was magnetic because of the mineral magnetite. Image:Rockgusev.jpgCross-sectional drawing of a typical rock from the plains of Gusev crater. Most rocks contain a coating of dust and one or more harder coatings. Veins of water-deposited minerals are visible, along with crystals of olvine. Veins may contain bromine salts. =Columbia Hills= Scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories. The six are: Clovis, Wishbone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence. They are named after a prominent rock in each group. Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other. Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration due to aqueous fluids. They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine—all of which can be carried around in water solutions. The Columbia Hills' rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and sulfates. The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates. This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates. Acid fog is believed to have changed some of the Watchtower rocks. This was in a 200 meter long section of Cumberland Ridge and the Husband Hill summit. Certain places became less crystalline and more amorphous. Acidic water vapor from volcanoes dissolved some minerals forming a gel. When water evaporated a cement formed and produced small bumps. This type of process has been observed in the lab when basalt rocks are exposed to sulfuric and hydrochloric acids.COLE, Shoshanna B., et al. 2015. IN-SITU EVIDENCE FOR ALTERATION BY ACID FOG ON HUSBAND HILL, GUSEV CRATER, MARS. 2015 GSA Annual Meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, USA (1–4 November 2015) Paper No. 94-10 The Clovis group is especially interesting because the Mössbauer spectrometer(MB) detected goethite in it.Klingelhofer, G., et al. (2005) Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXVI abstr. 2349 Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills's rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence, although the rocks probably once contained much olivine. Olivine is a marker for the lack of water because it easily decomposes in the presence of water. Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and anhydrate (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed sulfur and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form. One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, and iron. Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe+++ form, which would happen if water had been present. Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure silica were found in the soil. The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment. After Spirit stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or Mini-TES and confirmed the presence of large amounts of carbonate-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called \\"Comanche.\\" In summary, Spirit found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars. First atmospheric temperature profile MGS over the MER-B site. During a press conference on March 11, 2004, mission scientists presented the first temperature profile of the martian atmosphere ever measured. It was obtained by combining data taken from the Opportunity Mini-TES infrared spectrometer with data from the TES instrument on board the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) orbiter. This was necessary because Opportunity can only see up to 6 km high, and the MGS camera could not measure data all the way down to the ground. The data was acquired on February 15 (Sol 22) and is split into two data sets: Since the orbiter is in motion, some data was taken while it was approaching the Opportunity site, other when it was moving away. In the graph, these sets are marked \\"inbound\\" (black color) and \\"outbound\\" (red color). The dots represent Mini-TES (= rover) data and the straight lines are TES (=orbiter) data.

Smoky Hill Thompson remained behind to lead the defense of the trading post. The party trailed the natives to their camp in Thompson's Canyon, now known as Yellow House Canyon in present-day Lubbock, Texas, where they attacked on March 18. The hunters were repulsed and the natives escaped, including white captive Herman Lehmann, who was wounded in the battle. The hunters' casualties were four wounded and one later dying from wounds. It was later reported by the military that the natives suffered 35 dead and 22 wounded. This was one of the last armed conflicts between Native Americans and immigrants.

It was seen as an extension of the 1997 Moscow Memorandum but was ultimately rejected by Moldovan president Vladimir Voronin. The plan, presented in mid-November 2003 by Russia, was a detailed proposal for a united asymmetric federal Moldavian state. First published in Russian on the website of Transnistria's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the text was promoted by a Russian politician Dmitry Kozak, close ally of President Vladimir Putin and one of the key figures in his presidential team. For Transnistria, the memorandum presented an end to the previous Moscow policy, which assumed that the region would have equal status in federation with the rest of the country. According to the memorandum Russian troops (no more than 2000 strong, without heavy armaments) would remain in Transnistria for the transitional period but not later than 2020. It was proposed that the competences of government of the federal Moldova would be divided into three categories: those of the federation, those of individual subjects and those of joint competences. The plan presented several issues risking to cause blockage in policy-making. A lower house, elected by proportional representation, would pass legislation by simple majority. All organic laws (pertaining to the change of the federal power structure - section 7b) would need the assent of the senate (not \\"all laws\\"), however, whose representation would be disproportionate with respect to population figures: 13 senators elected by the federal lower house, nine by Transnistria and four by Gagauzia. By 2004 Transnistria had 14% and Gagauzia 4% of Moldova's total population. By this plan, Transnistrian senators would be able to block changes to the constitution of the unified state. Laws concerning the Federation (Moldova excluding Transnistria and Gagauzia) would not need ratification by the Senate. Large demonstrations against the Kozak memorandum took place in Chişinău in the days following the publication of the Russian proposal. Moldova's leadership declined to sign memorandum without coordination with the European organizations. A visit by President Putin to Moldova was canceled. Later in 2005, President Vladimir Voronin made a statement rejecting the 2003 Kozak memorandum because of contradiction with the Moldovan constitution which defines Moldova as a neutral state and could not allow any foreign troops on its soil, while the country cannot join military alliances. Moldova and the Kozak memorandum was a key issue at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ministerial meeting in Maastricht in December 2003, and disagreement between Russia on the one hand, and the EU and the US on the other on Moldova, was one of the principal reasons why a final joint declaration was not adopted after the meeting.

He was a younger son of Dyfnwal ab Owain, King of Strathclyde, and thus a member of the Cumbrian dynasty that had ruled the kingdom for generations. Máel Coluim's Gaelic name could indicate that he was born during either an era of amiable relations with the Scots, or else during a period of Scottish overlordship. In 945, the Edmund I, King of the English invaded the kingdom, and appears to have granted the Scots permission to dominate the Cumbrians. The English king is further reported to have blinded several of Máel Coluim's brothers in an act that could have been an attempt to deprive Dyfnwal of an heir. It is unknown when Dyfnwal's reign came to an end. There is reason to suspect that a certain Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal was a son of his, and that this man ruled when he assassinated the reigning King of Alba in 971. Certainly by 973, Máel Coluim was associated with the kingship, as both he and his father are recorded to have participated in a remarkable meeting of kings assembled by Edgar, King of the English. The context of this assembly is not entirely clear. It could have concerned the stability of the border between the English realm and that of the Scots and Cumbrians. It could have also focused upon lurking threat of Vikings based in Dublin and the Isles. Máel Coluim's father died in 975, having set off upon a pilgrimage to Rome. Quite when Máel Coluim succeeded Dyfnwal is uncertain. It could have been before, during, or after the assembly of 973. In any case, Máel Coluim's reign was evidently unremarkable, although the tenth-century Saltair na Rann preserves several lines of verse in his praise. Máel Coluim appears to have been succeeded by a brother, Owain. This man's successor, Owain Foel, seems to have been a son of Máel Coluim.

Máel Coluim's name is Gaelic, and may be evidence of a marriage alliance between his family and the neighbouring Alpínid dynasty of the Kingdom of Alba.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 44. The name may also reveal that Máel Coluim was a godson of his northern namesake, Máel Coluim mac Domnaill, King of Alba, and could perhaps be indicative of Dyfnwal's submission to this Scottish king.Parsons (2011) p. 129; Woolf (2007) p. 184.

If these sources are to be believed, they could reveal that the two princes had been English hostages before hostilities broke out, or that they were prisoners captured in the midst of the campaign.Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 ¶ 14; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 25. The ritual blinding of kings was not an unknown act in contemporary Britain and Ireland,Clarkson (2014) ch. 6 n. 23. and it is possible that Edmund may have meant to deprive Dyfnwal of a royal heir.Clarkson (2014) chs. 6 ¶ 14, 7 ¶ 5. The gruesome fate inflicted upon Dyfnwal's sons could reveal that their father was regarded to have broken certain pledges rendered to the English.Holland (2016) ch. Malmesbury ¶ 5; Molyneaux (2015) pp. 77–78; Woolf (2007) p. 183. One possibility is that Dyfnwal was punished for harbouring insular Scandinavian potentates.Oram (2011) ch. 2. Whatever lay behind the campaign, it could have been utilised by the English Cerdicing dynasty as a way to overawe and intimidate neighbouring potentates.Molyneaux (2015) pp. 33, 77–78. Máel Coluim was probably a younger son of Dyfnwal, and not one of the sons mutilated by the English. The Gaelic name borne by Máel Coluim could indicate that he was born during a period of Scottish dominance over the Cumbrian realm, or that he was born during a time of relatively warm relations between the Scots and Cumbrians.Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 5. Rhydderch and conflict with the Scots The name of Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal as it appears on folio 8v of British Library Cotton Faustina B IX (the Chronicle of Melrose): \\"\\".Anderson, AO (1922) p. 476; Stevenson, J (1835) p. 226; Cotton MS Faustina B IX (n.d.). After the death of Illulb mac Custantín, King of Alba in 962, the Scottish kingship appears to have been taken up by Dub mac Maíl Choluim, a man who was in turn replaced by Illulb's son, Cuilén.Broun (2004a). The latter's short reign appears to have been relatively uneventful.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 23. It nevertheless came to a violent end in 971, and there is reason to suspect that Cuilén's killer was a son of Dyfnwal.Broun (2015); Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 6; Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¶¶ 28–29; Oram (2011) chs. 2, 5; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 29; Busse (2006b); Busse (2006c); Broun (2004c) p. 135 tab.; Macquarrie (2004); Macquarrie (1998) pp. 6, 16; Hudson (1994) pp. 173 genealogy 6, 174 n. 10; Williams; Smyth; Kirby (1991) pp. 92, 104. The ninth- to twelfth-century Chronicle of the Kings of Alba reports that the killer was a certain Rhydderch ap Dyfnwal, a man who slew Cuilén for the sake of his own daughter.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 29; Macquarrie (1998) p. 16; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 476, 476 n. 1; Skene (1867) p. 151.

Although there is no specific evidence that Rhydderch was himself a king,Macquarrie (2004); Thornton (2001) p. 67 n. 66. the fact that Cuilén was involved with his daughter, coupled with the fact that his warband was evidently strong enough to overcome that of Cuilén, suggests that Rhydderch must have been a man of eminent standing.Macquarrie (2004). The name of Cináed mac Maíl Choluim as it appears on folio 15r of Oxford Bodleian Library Rawlinson B 488: \\"\\".The Annals of Tigernach (2016) § 997.3; Annals of Tigernach (2005) § 997.3; Bodleian Library MS. Rawl. B. 488 (n.d.). Cuilén seems to have been succeeded by his kinsman Cináed mac Maíl Choluim.Broun (2004a); Broun (2004b). One of the latter's first acts as King of Alba was evidently an invasion of the Kingdom of Strathclyde.Williams (2014); Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 25; Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¶ 30; Oram (2011) ch. 5; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 35; Woolf (2009) p. 259; Busse (2006a); Broun (2004b); Hudson (1998) pp. 151, 161; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 512; Skene (1867) p. 10. This campaign could well have been a retaliatory response to Cuilén's killing,Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 25; Woolf (2009) p. 259. carried out in the context of crushing a British affront to Scottish authority.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 25. In any event, Cináed's invasion ended in defeat,Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 35; Broun (2004b). a fact which coupled with Cuilén's killing reveals that the Cumbrian realm was indeed a power to be reckoned with.McGuigan (2015) p. 140; Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¶ 28; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 35. Whilst it is conceivable that Rhydderch could have succeeded Dyfnwal by the time of Cuilén's fall,Thornton (2001) p. 67 n. 66. another possibility is that Dyfnwal was still the king, and that Cináed's strike into Cumbrian territory was the last conflict of Dyfnwal's reign.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 35. In fact, it could have been at about this point when Máel Coluim took up the kingship.Hicks (2003) p. 44 n. 107. According to the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba, Cináed constructed some sort of fortification on the River Forth, perhaps the strategically located Fords of Frew near Stirling.McGuigan (2015) p. 149; Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¶ 30; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 37; Broun (2007) p. 54; Hicks (2003) pp. 41–42; Davidson (2002) pp. 147–148, 147 n. 167; Hudson (1998) pp. 151, 161; Hudson (1994) p. 96; Breeze (1992); Anderson, AO (1922) p. 512; Skene (1867) p. 10. One possibility is that this engineering project was undertaken in the context of limiting Cumbrian incursions.Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¶ 30; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 37.

An early twentieth-century depiction of Edgar being rowed down the River Dee by eight kings.Cassell's History of England (1909) p. 53. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Edgar met six kings at Chester. By the twelfth century, chroniclers alleged that eight kings rowed Edgar down the river in an act of submission.Williams (2004). One of these eight was Máel Coluim himself. Whilst the symbolic tale of the men rowing Edgar down the river may be an unhistorical embellishment, most of the names accorded to the eight kings can be associated with contemporary rulers, suggesting that some of these men may have taken part in a concord with him.Thornton (2001) p. 74. Although the latter accounts allege that the kings submitted to Edgar, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle merely states that they came to an agreement of cooperation with him, and thus became his (\\"co-workers\\", \\"even-workers\\", \\"fellow-workers\\").Davidson (2002) pp. 66–67, 140; Davidson (2001) p. 208; Thornton (2001) pp. 77–78. One possibility is that the assembly somehow relates to Edmund's attested incursion into Cumbria in 945.

If this supposed grant formed a part of the episode at Chester, it along with the concord of 945 could indicate that the assembly of 975 was not a submission as such, but more of a conference concerning mutual cooperation along the English borderlands.Downham (2007) p. 125; Williams (2004); Davidson (2002) p. 5; Thornton (2001) pp. 78–79. Although the precise chronology of Cumbrian expansion is uncertain, by 927 the southern frontier of the Kingdom of Strathclyde appears to have reached the River Eamont, close to Penrith.Dumville (2018) pp. 72, 110, 118; Edmonds (2015) pp. 44, 53; Charles-Edwards (2013a) p. 20; Charles-Edwards (2013b) pp. 9, 481; Parsons (2011) p. 138 n. 62; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 10; Davies (2009) p. 73, 73 n. 40; Downham (2007) p. 165; Clancy (2006); Todd (2005) p. 96; Stenton (1963) p. 328. As such, the location of the assembly of 973 at Chester would have been a logical site for all parties.Barrow (2001) p. 89. The name of Edgar as it appears on folio 142v of British Library Cotton Tiberius B I (the \\"C\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle): \\"\\".O'Keeffe (2001) p. 81; Whitelock (1996) p. 230; Thorpe (1861) p. 226; Cotton MS Tiberius B I (n.d.).

Considering the fact that the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle numbers the kings at six, if Cináed was indeed present, it is unlikely that his rival, Cuilén's brother Amlaíb mac Illuilb, was also in attendance.Woolf (2007) p. 208. Although the chronology concerning the reigns of Cináed and Amlaíb mac Illuilb is uncertainWoolf (2007) pp. 208–209.—with Amlaíb mac Illuilb perhaps reigning from 971/976–977Duncan (2002) pp. 21–22; Hudson (1994) p. 93. and Cináed from 971/977–995—the part played by the King of Alba at the assembly could well have concerned the frontier of his realm.Matthews (2007) p. 25. One of the other named kings seems to have been Maccus mac Arailt,Jennings (2015); Wadden (2015) pp. 27–28; Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 12; Williams (2014); Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 543; Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 31; Woolf (2009) p. 259; Breeze (2007) p. 155; Downham (2007) pp. 124–125, 167, 222; Matthews (2007) p. 25; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) p. 218; Davidson (2002) pp. 143, 146, 151; Jayakumar (2002) p. 34; Williams (1999) p. 116; Hudson (1994) p. 97; Jennings (1994) pp. 213–214; Stenton (1963) p. 364. whilst another could have been this man's brother, Gofraid.Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 12; Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 544; Breeze (2007) p. 156; Downham (2007) pp. 125 n. 10, 222; Matthews (2007) p. 25; Davidson (2002) pp. 143, 146, 151; Jayakumar (2002) p. 34. These two Islesmen may have been regarded as threats by the Scots and Cumbrians. Maccus and Gofraid are recorded to have devastated Anglesey at the beginning of the decade,Gough-Cooper (2015b) p. 43 § b993.1; Williams (2014); Downham (2007) p. 192; Matthews (2007) pp. 9, 25; Woolf (2007) pp. 206–207; Davidson (2002) p. 151; Anderson, AO (1922) pp. 478–479 n. 6; Rhŷs (1890) p. 262; Williams Ab Ithel (1860) pp. 24–25. which could indicate that Edgar's assembly was undertaken as a means to counter the menace posed by these energetic insular Scandinavians.Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 545; Downham (2007) pp. 222–223; Matthews (2007) pp. 9, 15; Woolf (2007) pp. 207–208. In fact, there is evidence to suggest that, as a consequence of the assembly at Chester, the brothers may have turned their attention from the British mainland westwards towards Ireland.Downham (2007) pp. 126–127, 222–223; Woolf (2007) p. 208. The name of Thored Gunnerson as it appears on folio 58v of British Library Cotton Domitian A VIII (the \\"F\\" version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle): \\"\\".Baker (2000) p. 83; Cotton MS Domitian A VIII (n.d.). Another aspect of the assembly may have concerned the remarkable rising power of Amlaíb Cúarán in Ireland.Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 545; Davidson (2002) p. 147. Edgar may have wished to not only rein in men such as Maccus and Gofraid, but prevent them—and the Scots and Cumbrians—from affiliating themselves with Amlaíb Cúarán, and recognising the latter's authority in the Irish Sea region.Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 545. Another factor concerning Edgar, and his Scottish and Cumbrian counterparts, may have been the stability of the northern English frontier. For example, a certain Thored Gunnerson is recorded to have ravaged Westmorland in 966, an action that may have been undertaken by the English in the context of a response to Cumbrian southward expansion.Williams (2014); Williams (2004); Whitelock (1996) p. 229; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 472; Thorpe (1861) p. 223. Although the Scottish invasion of Cumbrian and English territory unleashed after Cináed's inauguration could have been intended to tackle Cumbrian opposition, another possibility is that the campaign could have been executed as a way to counter any occupation of Cumbrian territories by Thored.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 26.

According to various Irish annals, Dyfnwal met his end whilst undertaking a pilgrimage.The Annals of Ulster (2017) § 975.2; The Annals of Tigernach (2016) § 975.3; Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 17, 7 n. 19; Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 36; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 41; The Annals of Ulster (2008) § 975.2; Woolf (2007) p. 184; Annals of Tigernach (2005) § 975.3; Broun (2004c) pp. 128–129; Macquarrie (2004); Hicks (2003) p. 42; Davidson (2002) pp. 39, 146; Macquarrie (1998) pp. 15–16; Hudson (1994) p. 174 n. 8; Anderson, AO (1922) p. 480, 480 n. 7. Surviving sources fail to note the Cumbrian realm between the obituaries of Dyfnwal in 975 and Máel Coluim in 997.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 41. Quite when Dyfnwal ceased to possess the kingship is uncertain. On one hand, there is reason to suspect that Rhydderch possessed power in 971. On the other hand, it is also possible that Dyfnwal was still reigning in 973.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 30; Busse (2006c); Thornton (2001) p. 55. In fact, this could have been the point when he ceded power to Máel Coluim: conceivably as a consequence of Rhydderch's assassination of Cuilén two years beforehand.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 36; Oram (2011) ch. 2. Alternately, Dyfnwal may have retained royal control until setting off upon his pilgrimage.Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 30; Busse (2006c); Hudson (1994) p. 101; Stenton (1963) p. 364. If correct, it could have been Edgar's death that precipitated this final trek, and the transference of the Cumbrian kingship to Máel Coluim. Máel Coluim's title as it appears on folio 9r of British Library Cotton Faustina B IX: \\"\\".Anderson, AO (1922) p. 478; Stevenson, J (1856) p. 100; Stevenson, J (1835) p. 34; Cotton MS Faustina B IX (n.d.). Máel Coluim's part in the assembly could have partly concerned his father's impending pilgrimage, and that he sought surety for Dyfnwal's safe passage through Edgar's realm. The fact that Máel Coluim is identified as one of the assembled kings could indicate that Dyfnwal had relinquished control to him at some point before the convention.Williams (2014); Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 30; Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¶ 29; Macquarrie (2004); Davidson (2002) p. 146; Williams; Smyth; Kirby (1991) p. 104. Conversely, Máel Coluim's title could instead indicate that he merely represented his aged father,Walker (2013) ch. 4 ¶ 30. and acted as regent.Breeze (2007) p. 154. Evidence that Máel Coluim had indeed assumed the kingship before the assembly may exist in the record of a certain who witnessed an English royal charter in 970 at Woolmer.McGuigan (2015) p. 101, 101 n. 302; Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 5, 7 n. 3; Birch (1893) pp. 557–560 § 1266; Thorpe (1865) pp. 237–243; Malcolm 4 (n.d.); S 779 (n.d.). Although the authenticity of this document is questionable, the attested Malcolm could well be identical to Máel Coluim himself.Molyneaux (2015) p. 57 n. 45; Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 5; Charles-Edwards (2013b) p. 544; Molyneaux (2011) p. 66; Keynes (2008) p. 50 n. 232; Davidson (2002) pp. 147, 147 n. 166, 152; Thornton (2001) p. 71; Hudson (1994) p. 174 n. 9; Malcolm 4 (n.d.). If Máel Coluim was indeed king in 973, Dyfnwal's role at the assembly may have been that of an 'elder statesman' of sorts—possibly serving as an adviser or mentor—especially considering his decades of experience in international affairs.Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 12; Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¶ 29; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 35. If Máel Coluim succeeded Dyfnwal, it could mean that Rhydderch—if he was indeed Máel Coluim's brother—was either dead or unable to reign as king. Whilst it is possible that the sons of Dyfnwal maimed by the English in 945 were still alive in the 970s, the horrific injuries endured by these men would have meant that they were deemed unfit to rule.Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 5; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 35. Notwithstanding the uncertainties surrounding his accession, Máel Coluim's reign was evidently unremarkable.Busse (2006c). Certainly, no source records Scottish-Cumbrian political relations at about the inception of Máel Coluim's reign,Clarkson (2012) ch. 9 ¶ 29. although the fact that Dyfnwal left for Rome could be evidence that the latter did not regard the realm or dynasty to be threatened during his absence.Hicks (2003) p. 42. Máel Coluim—alongside contemporary Irish, English, and Frankish kings—is commemorated by several lines of panegyric verse preserved by the tenth-century Saltair na Rann.McGuigan (2015) p. 140; Saltair na Rann (2011) §§ 2373–2376; Hudson (2002) pp. 34, 36; Hudson (1996) p. 102; Hudson (1994) pp. 101, 174 nn. 8–9; Hudson (1991) p. 147; Mac Eoin (1961) pp. 53 §§ 2373–2376, 55–56; Saltair na Rann (n.d.) §§ 2373–2376. He died in 997, the same year as his northern counterpart, Custantín mac Cuiléin, King of Alba.Woolf (2007) p. 222.

The area is named after the custom house of Royal Victoria Dock. Today the dock is used for recreation. However, it dominated the industry and commerce of the area from 1855 until the 1940s before closing in 1980. The main economic building of the area is the ExCeL Exhibition Centre and thus the district is connected to the City of London directly by two stations on the Docklands Light Railway. Nearby offices, factories and storage premises form the bulk of the rest of the workplaces of the area in the south of the district, close to the DLR route. Schools, a college, a care home, council offices and a parade of shops also support the local economy, which has parks to north and south-east. The district is contiguous with Canning Town, its forebear which was widely disparaged by the upper middle classes in Victorian England as a location heavily associated with rubber, packaging and miscellaneous manufacturing and dockyards, Custom House by not having such connotations is sometimes used for most of the south of the ancient parish of West Ham. A widely varying mapped overlap of the two areas relies on various interpretations including ward names and proximity to four DLR stations on the same line. History Microcosm of London Plate 028 - showing the earlier Custom House in the City of London Historically Newham was in the extreme west of Essex, and formed along with Canning Town the south of the parish of West Ham, a largely rural parish until the early 19th century. As trade expanded in the British Empire the royal docks were built connected to the wide River Thames in this district -- the demand for trade brought rapid population expansion: chiefly the families of dockworkers, warehousemen, carters (distributors), packaging and semi-skilled manufacturing hands, building and utilities workmen and workers in London's street and general distribution markets. About 1740 the number of householders was estimated at 570. In the first national census of 1801 the population of West Ham was 6,485. It rose steadily to 12,738 in 1841 and then began a growth, which was especially rapid between 1871 and 1901, when over 204,000 were added. By 1911, with 289,030 inhabitants, West Ham was seventh in size among English county boroughs, a status newly acquired. The new population were crowded within the boundaries of the ancient parish being in limited height of homes then affordable to most people. Unlike in the various wealthy streets of other London districts almost the whole population of this part of what was Canning Town consisted of low-paid workers who lived in cheap, unadorned brick and mortar low rise terraces. There was a chronic shortage of open land which only became available once again when the cost of sound mid-rise and high-rise buildings became lower. High rise was first adopted in the country as social housing, attaching a stigma to tower blocks, many of which have since been demolished, including the few in this district of what was West Ham or Canning Town. A slight population decline to 1931 paled into insignificance by the devastation wrought on this area in World War II, when bombing destroyed in many cases entire streets and forced large-scale evacuation. The area is marked in early 20th century maps as the eastern half of Canning Town.Map of East and West Ham W.R. Powell (editor), Institute of Historical Research, 1973 see above The first Custom House in London was built in 1275 next to Old Billingsgate Market in the City of London several miles to the west. Royal Victoria Dock which was the economic hub of the settlement is today in recreational use but it dominated the industry and commerce of the area from its 1855 opening until the 1940s and closed in 1980 due to containerisation of freight. ;Speedway motorcycling Custom House was home to the West Ham Hammers speedway team at the 120,000 capacity West Ham Stadium. Many roads built on the stadium site following its demolition are named after the stars of the team - including Aub Lawson, Jack Young and promoter Johnnie Hoskins. Amenities ExCeL Exhibition Centre west entrance Custom House for ExCeL DLR station The Custom House Hotel (on the corner of Freemasons Road), was opened in 2001 to service visitors to the ExCeL centre in the district. With a large park, Newham City Farm, a King George V Park, vegetable allotments and arguably the north side of Royal Albert Dock, approximately half of Custom House's land use is for housing. The two main roads which serve Custom House are Freemasons Road near the Custom House DLR station and Prince Regent Lane. Buses serving Freemasons Road are the 241, 325 and 678 (school journeys only). The Custom House Surgery is also located on this road. The Royal Docks Community School and The Shipman Youth Centre are both on Prince Regent Lane, in addition to local stores which serve the residents. Bus routes passing through Prince Regent Lane are the 147, 300 and 473.  Education  Custom House has a number of primary schools and secondary schools. Here is a list of them: Scott Wilkie (Primary) Rosetta (Primary) Calverton (Primary) St Joachim (Primary) The school dates from 1896, though the present building was opened as recently as 1968. Royal Docks Academy (Secondary) Sport and recreation Custom House has a King George's Field in memorial to King George V. The Canning Town recreational ground is located on Freemasons Road. In the early 1930s, Custom House was home to a football league club, Thames A.F.C, before being dissolved in 1932. Although no adult football teams play within Custom House, various teams in recent years with names containing 'Custom House' have played just outside it. Custom House United Est 2018 played at the Will Thorne Pavilion on Stansfeld Road which is in E6 Beckton. Custom House Community FC Est 2013 played at the Terrence McMillian Stadium in neighbouring Plaistow but just over the A13 from Custom House.In recent history Custom House FC founded in 2011. Could be seen on alternate Saturday's at their Home ground - Lyle Park in Silvertown. There is no longer any green space within the town that an adult football club could use as there is no adequate changing facilities. Founder members of the punk band The Cockney Rejects, brothers Mick and Jeff Geggus, were born in Custom House, as was actor Danny Dyer.  Places of worship  In Custom House there are three purpose built Christian churches representing the: Anglican, Baptist and Catholic denominations. On Berwick road is the church of St Annes, which today is part a two church catholic parish known as the Parish of Our Lady of Walsingham (POLOW). The Ascension church is the church of England place of worship on baxter road since 1891. On Prince Regent Lane next to the public library is the Custom House Baptist Church. At different times in recent years, Royal Docks Academy has been used as a place of worship by various evangelical churches. Transport =Roads= The district's roads feed into the London radial route the A11 to the north. In the east of the district a single carriageway, the A112, links Stratford via West Ham to the north to the Excel Exhibition Centre by Custom House railway station where it terminates in the south. =Docklands Light Railway and Crossrail= *Custom House station, currently serving the Docklands Light Railway, and from 2021 will also serve Crossrail, also known as the Elizabeth Line. *Prince Regent DLR station References ;References ;Books * See also *ExCeL Exhibition Centre *West Ham Stadium Category:Districts of the London Borough of Newham Category:Areas of London Category:Districts of London on the River Thames ","title":"Custom House, Newham"},{"id":"4844471","text":"This is a list of all the United States Supreme Court cases from volume 79 of the United States Reports.

Life and career Osias attended school in Balaoan, Vigan and San Fernando, and was named a government scholar to the United States in 1905. He studied at the University of Chicago in 1906 and 1907. He graduated from the Western Illinois State Teachers College at Macomb, Illinois in 1908, and from the Teachers College of Columbia University in New York City in 1910. On his return to the Philippine Islands, he taught and later assumed various administrative positions, particularly in the field of education. He successively became the first Filipino Superintendent of Schools (1915 to 1916), Assistant Director of Education (1917 to 1921), a lecturer at the University of the Philippines (1919 to 1921), and President of National University (1921–1936), a private institution. Osias also entered national politics. He was a member of the first Philippine mission to the United States (1919 to 1920). He was elected a member of the Philippine Senate in 1925, and, as a Nationalista, a Resident Commissioner in the United States House of Representatives in 1928, reelected in 1931 and served from March 4, 1929 until January 3, 1935, when his term expired in accordance with the new Philippine Commonwealth Government. In 1934 he was an unsuccessful candidate for election to the Philippine Senate, but became a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1934, and a member of the first National Assembly in 1935. In 1939 he was a member of the Economic Mission to the United States, and chairman of the Educational Mission between 1938 and 1941. Back in the Philippines, Osias became chairman of the National Council of Education in 1941, Director of Publicity and Propaganda until January 1942, chairman of the National Cooperative Administration in 1941, later Assistant Commissioner of the Department of Education, Health, and Public Welfare, then Secretary of Education until 1945.

Stephanus of Byzantium (s. v.) describes Doliche as an island close to the Lycian coast, on the authority of Callimachus; and he adds that Alexander, in his Periplus of Lycia, calls it Dolichiste. It is mentioned by Pliny (v. 31) and Ptolemy (v. 3). Pliny places it opposite to Chimaera (geography); and both Pliny and Ptolemy name it Dolichiste. Doliche or Dolichiste, is a long island, as the name implies. It lies near the southern coast of Lycia, west of the ruins of Myra, and in front of the spacious bay now named Kekova. The island is a narrow ridge of rock, incapable of yielding a constant supply of water; each house had therefore a tank hollowed in the rock, and lined with stucco.Francis Beaufort, Karamania, p. 21. William Martin Leake Asia Minor, p. 127. speaks of the ruins of a large city, with a noble theatre, in a fine harbour formed by a range of rocky islands.

Since their first appearance in The Brave and the Bold #28 (February/March 1960), various incarnations of the team have appeared in film, television, and video game adaptations. Film =Live-action= Justice League: Mortal (cancelled) In February 2007, it was announced that Warner Bros hired husband and wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a Justice League film. The news came around the same time that Joss Whedon's long-developed Wonder Woman film had been canceled, as well as The Flash, written and directed by David S. Goyer. Titled Justice League: Mortal, Michele and Kiernan Mulroney submitted their script to Warner Bros. in June 2007, receiving positive feedback, which prompted the studio to immediately fast track production in the hopes of filming to begin before the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Warner Bros. was less willing to proceed on development with a sequel to Superman Returns, having been disappointed with the box office return. Brandon Routh was not approached to reprise the role of Superman in Justice League Mortal, nor was Christian Bale from Batman Begins. Warner Bros. intended for Justice League: Mortal to be the start of a new film franchise, and to branch out into separate sequels and spin-offs. Shortly after filming finished with The Dark Knight, Bale stated in an interview that \\"It’d be better if it doesn't tread on the toes of what our Batman series is doing,\\" though he personally felt it would make more sense for Warner Bros. to release the film after his planned \\"Batman 3\\" (later called The Dark Knight Rises). Jason Reitman was the original choice to direct Justice League, but he turned it down, as he considers himself an independent filmmaker and prefers to stay out of big budget superhero films. George Miller signed to direct in September 2007, with Barrie Osbourne producing on a projected $220 million budget. The following month roughly 40 actors and actresses were auditioning for the ensemble superhero roles, among them were Joseph Cross, Michael Angarano, Max Thieriot, Minka Kelly, Adrianne Palicki and Scott Porter. Miller intended to cast younger actors as he wanted them to \\"grow\\" into their roles over the course of several films. D. J. Cotrona was cast as Superman, along with Armie Hammer as Batman. Jessica Biel reportedly declined the Wonder Woman role after being in negotiations. The character was also linked to actresses Teresa Palmer and Shannyn Sossamon, along with Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who confirmed that she had auditioned. Ultimately Megan Gale was cast as Wonder Woman, while Palmer was cast as Talia al Ghul, whom Miller had in mind to act with a Russian accent. The script for Justice League: Mortal would have featured the John Stewart character as the Green Lantern, a role originally offered to Columbus Short. Hip hop recording artist and rapper Common was cast, with Adam Brody as The Flash / Barry Allen, and Jay Baruchel as the lead villain, Maxwell Lord. Longtime Miller collaborator Hugh Keays-Byrne had been cast in an unnamed role, rumored to be Martian Manhunter. Aquaman had yet to be cast. Marit Allen was hired as the original costume designer before her untimely death in November 2007, and the responsibilities were assumed by Weta Workshop. However, the Writers Strike began that same month and placed the film on hold. Warner Bros. had to let the options lapse for the cast, but development was fast tracked once more in February 2008 when the strike ended. Warner Bros. and Miller wanted to start filming immediately, but production was pushed back three months. Originally, the majority of Justice League: Mortal would be shot at Fox Studios Australia in Sydney, with other locations scouted nearby at local colleges, and Sydney Heads doubling for Happy Harbor. The Australian Film Commission also had a say with casting choices, giving way for George Miller to cast Gale, Palmer and Keays-Bryne, all Australian natives. The production crew was composed entirely of Australians, but the Australian government denied Warner Bros. a 40 percent tax rebate as they felt they had not hired enough Australian actors. Miller was frustrated, stating that \\"A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Australian film industry is being frittered away because of very lazy thinking. They're throwing away hundreds of millions of dollars of investment that the rest of the world is competing for and, much more significantly, highly skilled creative jobs.\\" Production offices were then moved to Vancouver Film Studios in Canada. Filming was pushed back to July 2008, while Warner Bros was still confident they could release the film for a summer 2009 release. With production delays continuing, and the success of The Dark Knight in 2008, Warner Bros. decided to focus on development of individual films featuring the main heroes, allowing director Christopher Nolan to separately complete his Batman trilogy with The Dark Knight Rises in 2012. Gregory Noveck, senior vice president of creative affairs for DC Entertainment stated \\"we’re going to make a Justice League movie, whether it’s now or 10 years from now. But we’re not going to do it and Warners is not going to do it until we know it’s right.\\" Actor Adam Brody joked \\"They [Warner Brothers] just didn’t want to cross their streams with a whole bunch of Batmans in the universe.\\" Warner Bros. relaunched development for the solo Green Lantern film, released in 2011 as a critical and financial disappointment. Meanwhile, film adaptations for The Flash and Wonder Woman continued to languish in development while filming for a Superman reboot was commencing in 2011 with Man of Steel, produced by Nolan and written by David S. Goyer, which would go on to launch the DC Extended Universe. DC Extended Universe The Justice League are a common narrative plot thread in the DC Extended Universe starting with Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice with Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman teaming up against Doomsday and in Suicide Squad where Bruce gets the files on Barry Allen and Arthur Curry from Amanda Waller. An live action Justice League movie was released in November 2017 and received mixed reviews from critics and earned over $657 million worldwide. The film was directed by Zack Snyder and written by Chris Terrio.Why Justice League Won't Be as Dark as Batman v Superman The film stars Ben Affleck as Batman, Henry Cavill as Superman, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, Ezra Miller as The Flash, Jason Momoa as Aquaman and Ray Fisher as Cyborg. The film also stars Amy Adams as Lois Lane, Jeremy Irons as Alfred Pennyworth, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, Connie Nielsen as Hippolyta, Joe Morton as Silas Stone, Ciarán Hinds as Steppenwolf, Amber Heard as Mera and J. K. Simmons as James Gordon. =Animation= * Justice League: The New Frontier is a direct- to-video animated film adaptation of popular DC Comics limited series DC: The New Frontier released on DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray Disc in the United States on February 26, 2008. The film was written by Justice League writer Stan Berkowitz, with Darwyn Cooke serving as story and visual consultant. * In Superman/Batman: Public Enemies, some members of the Justice League (Captain Atom, Power Girl, Starfire, Black Lightning, Captain Marvel and Hawkman) as well as several other superheroes, are shown working for President Lex Luthor. * Another direct-to-video film titled Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths was released in 2010. The film was originally brought up as a possible return to the Justice League Unlimited animated series with the title Justice League: Worlds Collide. Justice League: Worlds Collide would have been set in the DC animated universe. It was originally going to be produced concurrently with the first season of Justice League Unlimited, bridging the gap between the second season of Justice League and the relaunched show. The production was shelved just before the start of filming, but the script was later adapted into the direct-to-video film Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, with changes that included removing all references to the DCAU continuity. As a result, the feature as originally intended is now unlikely to ever be produced. The film featured a League consisting of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, The Flash, and Martian Manhunter. Aquaman, Firestorm, Black Canary, Red Tornado and Black Lightning appeared near the end of the film, and were supposedly offered full-time membership by Batman. In addition, alternate versions of Justice League Detroit (save for Steel) were shown as part of the Crime Syndicate of America, as were Black Canary and Green Arrow analogues. Analogues of Zatanna, Blue Beetle (Ted Kord), Power Girl and Red Tornado made brief cameos on a computer screen. * Another animated feature, Justice League: Doom, was released on February 2012. The film featured a Justice League consisting of Superman, Batman, Cyborg, the Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), Wonder Woman and Martian Manhunter. * DC released another animated film on July 30, 2013, entitled Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox. The film, based on the Flashpoint crossover, is centered on the Flash, who inadvertently changes the time stream by travelling back in time to save his mother. In the new world created, Flash finds himself speedless in a world without a Justice League and suffering from a devastating war between the Atlanteans and Amazonians. Relying on the help of Batman, in this world a vengeful, alcoholic Thomas Wayne, the Flash must find the prime suspect, Professor Zoom, and find a way to fix the time stream. * Another animated feature, Lego Batman: The Movie – DC Super Heroes Unite, was released in early February 2013 and features members of the Justice League, particularly Batman and Superman, fighting Lex Luthor and The Joker in Lego form. * In DC Showcase: Green Arrow, Green Arrow and Black Canary are members of the Justice League and their logo was seen on Oliver's phone. * A version of the Justice League similar to The New 52 appears in the movie Justice League: War, with a team consisting of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Flash (Barry Allen), Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), and Shazam. The same team appears in Justice League: Throne of Atlantis, with Aquaman as a newcomer. Superman, Batman, Cyborg, Flash and Wonder Woman appear in Justice League vs. Teen Titans. * The Justice League is featured in the animated film JLA Adventures: Trapped in Time. The team consists of Superman, Batman, Cyborg, The Flash (Barry Allen), Wonder Woman and Aquaman. Karate Kid, Dawnstar, and Robin appear as well. * Justice League Dark appears in their own animated film Justice League Dark, with the cast including Batman, Zatanna, John Constantine, Etrigan the Demon, Deadman, Swamp Thing and Black Orchid. The traditional Justice League team appears as well, consisting of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (John Stewart), Flash (Barry Allen), Hawkman and Martian Manhunter. * The Justice League appears in DC Super Heroes vs. Eagle Talon.

Television Justice League of America has been adapted for television numerous times. =Animation= * The first animated appearance of the Justice League was in the 1967 television series The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure. The team appeared in only three segments of the run of the show. The members seen are Superman, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Flash, and the Atom. * The longest-running version of the Justice League was the loosely adapted series called Super Friends, which ran in various incarnations from 1973 to 1986. * The Justice League make their first appearance in the DC animated universe in \\"The Call\\", a two-part episode of Batman Beyond. It portrayed a futuristic version of the team, referred to as \\"Justice League Unlimited\\", or \\"JLU\\" for short. The lineup consisted of an aging Superman, a brand new Green Lantern, Big Barda, plus new characters: Aquagirl (Aquaman's daughter), Micron (similar to Atom), and Warhawk (who is later revealed to be the son of Green Lantern and Hawkgirl). Though he does not appear in Batman Beyond, Static and his ally Gear are also revealed to be members of the future Justice League in the Static Shock episode \\"Future Shock\\". * Cartoon Network's Justice League series debuted in 2001 and lasted for two seasons. Although not the Justice League's first appearance in the DC animated universe, it was their first chronological appearance. In July 2004, the series was retitled and revised for its third, fourth, and fifth seasons as Justice League Unlimited. Both of these were extensions of the DC animated universe, continuing the continuity begun by Batman: The Animated Series, Superman: The Animated Series, The New Batman Adventures, Static Shock, Batman Beyond, and The Zeta Project. * In the two-part fourth season finale of The Batman, titled \\"The Joining\\", Batman allied with Martian Manhunter against aliens known as \\"the Joining\\". At the end of the second episode, J'onn contacts Batman and asks him to join his group, prompting Batman to remark that J'onn has formed \\"quite a league\\". The members of the \\"League\\" featured in this sequence were Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Hawkman, and the Flash. In \\"The Batman/Superman Story, Part Two\\", Superman joins up with the Justice League. Much of the fifth season revolves around team-ups with League members and Batman. Other elements that were put forth included Batman recruiting Superman, and a headquarters combining elements of the Hall of Justice from Super Friends and the Watchtower from Justice League. * \\"The League\\" is mentioned in a conversation between Batman and Plastic Man in an episode of Batman: The Brave and the Bold. Presumably, this refers to the Justice League. In fact, the show has featured many team-ups that included various heroes that were members of the JLA at one time or another, such as Adam Strange, Aquaman, Batman, Black Canary, Blue Beetle, Booster Gold, Captain Marvel, Elongated Man, Etrigan the Demon, Fire, Ice, Firestorm (both Ronald Raymond and Jason Rusch), Green Arrow, Roy Harper, Guy Gardner, Hal Jordan, G'nort, Kilowog, Huntress, Mister Miracle, Oberon, Big Barda, Black Lightning, Metamorpho, Phantom Stranger, Plastic Man, Red Tornado, Superman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, the Flash, Vixen, and Zatanna. The League itself is later seen in a flashback, meeting aboard the Satellite in \\"Sidekicks Assemble!\\". The roster seen consists of Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern (Hal Jordan), the Flash (Barry Allen), Aquaman, the Martian Manhunter, Black Canary, Green Arrow, Red Tornado, and Fire, though Superman and Wonder Woman have no dialogue and are seen only from behind due to the characters not being available to the show at the time. The Justice League International is featured in \\"Darkseid Descending!\\", and consists of Batman, Aquaman, Martian Manhunter, Fire and Ice, Guy Gardner, Booster Gold and Blue Beetle (Jaime Reyes). It is mentioned by Aquaman that there had been a previous incarnation of the JLA (presumably the original roster featured in \\"Sidekicks Assemble!\\"), and that it had disbanded under unpleasant circumstances. * A twenty-person roster of the Justice League appears in the Young Justice animated series as mentors to the young heroes. The cast includes Bruce Greenwood as Batman, Phil LaMarr as Aquaman, Alan Tudyk as Green Arrow, Rob Lowe (and Chad Lowe) as Captain Marvel, Nolan North as Superman and Zatara (later Doctor Fate), George Eads as Flash, Kevin Michael Richardson as Martian Manhunter and John Stewart, Vanessa Marshall as Black Canary, Dee Bradley Baker as Hal Jordan, Maggie Q as Wonder Woman, Jeff Bennett as Red Tornado, Michael T. Weiss as Captain Atom and Zehra Fazal as Hawkwoman. In the two-part pilot episode \\"Independence Day\\" (with the second part being renamed \\"Fireworks\\"), Hawkman is also shown as part of the team as well. At the end of the episode, Red Tornado volunteers to watch over the members of Young Justice as their guardian, while Black Canary is assigned as their combat instructor. The members of Young Justice operate out of the Secret Sanctuary in Happy Harbor, which Batman, the leader of the Justice League, describes as having been the original headquarters of the JL during their early years. Speedy explains that the Justice League currently operates out of the Watchtower in space while using the Hall of Justice in Washington, D.C. as a decoy headquarters to misdirect enemies and the general public. In \\"Usual Suspects\\", Red Arrow, Atom, Icon, Doctor Fate and Plastic Man officially joined the team. **In the season 2 premiere, it is confirmed that Black Lightning, as well as former Young Justice members Zatanna and Rocket have joined the team as well. **As of the conclusion of season 3, the roster officially consists of 33 members: Atom, Aquaman, Batman, Batwoman, Black Canary, Black Lightning, Blue Devil, Captain Atom, Captain Marvel/Shazam, Doctor Fate, Elongated Man, Fire, Flash, Green Arrow, Green Lantern (Guy Gardner, Hal Jordan, John Stewart), Hardware, Hawkman, Hawkwoman, Ice, Icon, Katana, Magog, Martian Manhunter, Metamorpho, Plastic Man, Red Tornado, Rocket, Steel, Superman, Wonder Woman and Zatanna, with 4 further members (Aquaman, Blue Beetle, Red Arrow and Zatara) having retired or left the League. * In a sketch for Mad, Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman are convinced to change the name from the Super Friends to the Justice League after a musical appeal by fellow heroes. * The Justice League is re-imagined as animals in the DC Nation Shorts Farm League with Superman as Supermanatee, Batman as a mouse, Wonder Woman as Wonder Wombat, Flash as the Flish, Green Lantern as a boar, Aquaman as Aquamandrill, Captain Marvel as Shazham!, Robin as Robin's Egg, and Cyborg as Cybug. * A new Justice League animated series titled Justice League Action debuted on Cartoon Network in Fall 2016.https://www.ew.com/article/2016/01/29/new-justice-league-cartoon- announcement The series features a revolving cast anchored by Batman, Wonder Woman, and Superman. * The Justice League appears in Harley Quinn.\\" Its members consist of Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Zatanna, Aquaman, Green Lantern (John Stewart), and the Flash. In the episode \\"Devil's Snare\\"; Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and the Flash arrive in Gotham City to stop the tree monsters attacking.

It was then the League were imprisoned in a magic fairy tale book by the Queen of Fables.https://www.superherohype.com/tv/477053-the-justice-league-arrives-in- harley-quinn-1-12-promo In \\"A Fight Worth Fighting For\\", the League were finally released by Zatanna, after Harley Quinn and the Joker retrieved the book, in order to defeat Doctor Psycho, who has gained control of a Parademon army and took over Gotham. In the following episode \\"Lovers' Quarrel\\", the League, in particular Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman, easily defeat the Parademons and Harley's crew, who are mind-controlled by Psycho, but while attempting to send Poison Ivy to the Phantom Zone, they are stopped by Harley, allowing Ivy to poison them with a toxin that makes them suddenly flirt with one another. =Live action= * Legends of the Superheroes was a 1979 two- part special that adapted the Justice League. It featured Adam West, Burt Ward, and Frank Gorshin returning to their roles from the 1966–1968 live- action Batman television series: Batman, Robin, and the Riddler respectively. Other heroes portrayed on the show included Black Canary, Captain Marvel, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Huntress, and more. * Justice League of America was a series pilot produced for CBS in 1997, but failed to sell. The pilot used less well-known characters to avoid the licensing issues surrounding Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. The characters used were the Guy Gardner Green Lantern, Fire, Ice, the Barry Allen Flash, and the Ray Palmer Atom set against a version of the Weather Wizard. * Smallville featured a version of the Justice League in its sixth-season episode \\"Justice\\". The members of the team were drawn from versions of DC Comics heroes that had previously appeared in the show: \\"Impulse\\" from the season four episode \\"Run\\"; \\"Aquaman\\" (A.C.) from the season five episode \\"Aqua\\"; \\"Cyborg\\" (Victor Stone) from the season five episode of the same name, and \\"Green Arrow\\" who had been appearing as a regular character through season Six. The episode had the team temporarily recruiting main characters Clark Kent, who Green Arrow dubs \\"Boy Scout\\", and Chloe Sullivan, who acts as the team's advisor through a computer network under the codename \\"Watchtower\\". Later, in the Season Seven episode \\"Siren\\", Dinah Lance joined Oliver's team as the \\"Black Canary\\". She returns in the Season Eight premiere with Aquaman and Green Arrow to find Clark. However, after A.C. and Dinah have their identities exposed, Oliver makes the call for the team to temporarily disband. Later in the season, when Oliver reconnects with his heroic side in \\"Identity\\", the team reunites. In the episode \\"Bulletproof\\", it is mentioned that Detective John Jones (Martian Manhunter) has helped Oliver's team and got Oliver out of trouble with the police and is considered a member of the team. Clark and Chloe become more involved with the League as well, with Clark joining Bart on a mission in Keystone during \\"Hex\\", whilst in the same episode Chloe becomes a full-time 'Watchtower' for the team. Dr. Emil is a staff physician at Metropolis General Hospital and Metropolis University, who is also on Oliver Queen's payroll. Season Eight concludes with Flash, Black Canary, Green Arrow, and Clark working together to stop Doomsday. In the closing scenes Chloe reveals that Bart, Dinah, and Oliver have gone missing. In season 9 episode \\"Absolute Justice\\" members Green Arrow, Clark, John Jones, and Chloe aid members of the Justice Society of America. In the episode Doctor Fate restores John Jones's powers. Arrowverse * The Flash and its related TV series Arrow, Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow have hinted towards a Justice League in the future, with the heroes of the different series teaming up for annual crossover events. Barry Allen is shown to own a building resembling the Hall of Justice during the Invasion crossover, which the heroes use as a base during that crossover. An A.I. named Gideon from the future claims that Barry as the Flash is a \\"founding member\\" before being cut off. The Justice League is directly mentioned in the Arrow episode \\"Living Proof\\". *In the end of the Arrowverse crossover Crisis on Infinite Earths, the heroes of the Earth-Prime (an amalgamation of Earth-1, Earth-38 and Black Lightning's Earth), after a memorial for Oliver Queen, sits at a table in an abandoned S.T.A.R.

The Classic Lake Conference was one of many in the Minneapolis–St. Paul metro area that divide schools in proximity into different conferences. The mission of the conference was to promote and recognize excellence by providing quality experiences for students in programs of academics, arts, athletics and activities. The Classic Lake Conference conducted its activities under the auspices of and in concert with the Minnesota State High School League. The five member high schools were, Robbinsdale Armstrong High School (Plymouth), Edina High School (Edina), Hopkins High School (Minnetonka), Minnetonka High School (Minnetonka), and Wayzata High School (Plymouth). Until 1999, Richfield High School was a member but left because of declining enrollment and changing demographics. Until 2005, St. Louis Park High School and Robbinsdale Cooper High School were also a members, but left for the North Suburban Conference due to their smaller student bodies. At a conference meeting, held November 7, 2008, the superintendents of four of five schools voted to remove Armstrong from the conference starting in the 2010-2011 school year. Despite having comparable enrollment to the conference's other schools, Armstrong has a lower percentage of students that compete in athletics. To facilitate scheduling of competitions, MSHSL bylaw states that a conference may not have less than five members. The original intention was to dissolve the Classic Lake. Armstrong, Hopkins and Wayzata applied to the Northwest Suburban Conference as a group. They were rejected, but Armstrong was later offered a spot as a single school. The other four then applied to the already huge Lake Conference, but were turned down. The Classic Lake disbanded following the 2009-10 academic year. Armstrong joined the Northwest Suburban Conference while Edina, Hopkins, Minnetonka and Wayzata joined Eden Prairie in the Lake Conference. All of the teams in the Classic Lake were part of the Lake Conference until 1993; because of the size of Lake, it had been split into two divisions: Lake Red and Lake Blue. All of the Classic Lake's schools were all in the Lake Blue conference, except for Robbinsdale Armstrong; most of the remaining schools merged to form a revised Lake Conference.

The largest battle in Ohio during the war, Buffington Island contributed to the capture of the famed Confederate cavalry raider, Brig. Gen. John H. Morgan, who was seeking to escape Union army pursuers across the Ohio River at a ford opposite Buffington Island. Delayed overnight, Morgan was almost surrounded by Union cavalry the next day, and the resulting battle ended in a Confederate rout, with over half of the 1,700-man Confederate force being captured. General Morgan and some 700 men escaped, but the daring raid finally ended on July 26 with his surrender after the Battle of Salineville. Morgan's Raid was of little military consequence, but it did spread terror among much of the population of southern and eastern Ohio, as well as neighboring Indiana. Background Hoping to divert the attention of the Federal Army of the Ohio from Southern forces in Tennessee, Brig. Gen. John H. Morgan and 2,460 Confederate cavalrymen, along with a battery of horse artillery, rode west from Sparta, Tennessee, on June 11, 1863. Twelve days later, when a second Federal army (the Army of the Cumberland) began its Tullahoma Campaign, Morgan decided it was time to move northward. His column marched into Kentucky, fighting a series of minor battles, before commandeering two steamships to ferry them across the Ohio River into Indiana (against orders), where, at the Battle of Corydon, Morgan routed the local militia. With his path now relatively clear, Morgan headed eastward on July 13 past Cincinnati and rode across southern Ohio, stealing horses and supplies along the way. The Union response was not long in coming, as Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, commanding the Department of the Ohio, ordered out all available troops, as well as sending several Union Navy gunboats steaming up the Ohio River to contest any Confederate attempt to reach Kentucky or West Virginia and safety. Brig. Gen. Edward H. Hobson led several columns of Federal cavalry in pursuit of Morgan's raiders, which by now had been reduced to some 1,930 men. Ohio Governor David Tod called out the local militia, and volunteers formed companies to protect towns and river crossings throughout the region. On July 18, Morgan, having split his column earlier, led his reunited force towards Middleport, Ohio, a quiet river town near the Eight Mile Island Ford, where Morgan intended to cross into West Virginia. Running a gauntlet of small arms fire, Morgan's men were denied access to the river and to Middleport itself (which had a ferry), and he headed towards the next ford upstream at Buffington Island, some 20 miles to the southeast. Arriving near Buffington Island and the nearby tiny hamlet of Portland, Ohio, towards evening on July 18, Morgan found that the ford was blocked by several hundred local militia ensconced behind hastily thrown up earthworks. As a dense fog and darkness settled in, Morgan decided to camp for the night to allow his jaded men and horses to rest. He was concerned that even if he pushed aside the enemy troops, he might lose additional men in the darkness as they tried to navigate the narrow ford. The delay proved to be a fatal mistake. Fitch's Fleet USS Fairplay 1862-1865, Tinclad #17 Camps & anchorages the night before the battle. The US Navy's Mississippi Squadron was involved in Battle of Buffington Island. Morgan had brought field cannons with his column. A heavy river blockade and a means was realized early in the chase while Morgan's column traveled easterly towards Cincinnati, Ohio. Lt Commander Leroy Fitch's fleet included the Brilliant, Fairplay, Moose, Reindeer, St. Clair, Silver Lake, Springfield, Victory, Naumkeag, and Queen City, which were tinclads and ironclads. A few of these steamers lagged behind to zone-up protecting against a possible doubling back of Morgan's column. The forward vessels were each assigned a patrol zone along the Mason, Jackson and Wood counties of West Virginia by Fitch's instruction. Naumkeag patrolled from Point Pleasant, West Virginia to Eight Mile Island zone and Springfield guarded from Pomeroy, Ohio towards Letart Islands. Victory's cannon balls have been found along Leading Creek, Ohio, its patrol from Middleport, Ohio to Eight Mile Island along the West Virginia river bank. The Magnolia, Imperial, Alleghany Belle, and Union tinclads and armed packets which were privateers along with others documented under Parkersburg Logistics' command. The Army's \\"amphibious division\\" officer, Major General Ambrose E. Burnside at his Cincinnati headquarters, provided intelligence of Morgan's march and turned his flagship, Alleghany Belle, over to Fitch before the battle. The \\"amphibious division\\" tinclads had four to six large jonboats (sideboats) used to fire rifles from, for landing to give chase and pickup prisoners. Fitch's flagship was the ironclad USS Moose.\\"Operations of the Mississippi Squadron during Morgan's Raid\\" by Mark F. Jenkins Moose and Fitch's dispatch privateer, Imperial, were tied up within earshot of the island the night before the battle. It has been written that Fitch had the boilers fired up and shooting its large cannons at the island on first rifle fire, slightly out of range before steam could make way. Allegheny Belle was a little farther down tied up along the Ohio side. Having heard Moose's cannons, it made steam and soon brought up Burnsides' \\"amphibious infantry\\" (M. F. Jenkins 1999). Continuing upstream after the main battle broke into unit maneuver and skirmishes, USS Moose fired on a Confederate Artillery column trying to cross the river above the island at the next shoal crossing. Fitch dispatched Imperial to recover Confederate field artillery left behind there. All along the river, spotty ironclad and field cannon fire with clusters of rifle fire was heard shooting at Morgan's scouts looking for another possible ford. Meanwhile, Parkersburg Logistics terminal had sent a local armed packet with 9th Infantry sentries below Blennerhassett Island on word of the Battle's gunfire some twenty miles below. These paralleled patrols opposite the Belpre, Ohio Union Army encampment below the Ohio side of the terminal. This steamboat river harbor and large land Debarkations Camp blocked Morgan's further attempt to ford the river upstream turning his retreat northerly and away from this Ohio River area. The local support vessels were busy hauling ammunition, rations and prisoners. Belpre, Ohio had a supply receiving dockage and depot. Battle Map of Buffington Island Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The battlefield monument On the foggy morning of July 19, two Federal brigades under August Kautz and Henry M. Judah finally caught up with Morgan and attacked his position on the broad flood plain just north of Portland, nearly encircling the Confederates as another column under James M. Shackelford arrived on the scene. In the spirited early fighting, Maj. Daniel McCook, the 65-year-old patriarch of the famed Fighting McCooks, was mortally wounded. Nearly 3,000 Federals were soon engaged with Morgan's outnumbered and exhausted men. In addition, two Union gunboats, the U.S.S. Moose and the U.S.S. Allegheny Belle, steamed into the narrow channel separating Buffington Island from the flood plain and opened fire on Morgan's men, spraying them with shell fragments. Soon they were joined by a third gunboat. Morgan, his way to the Buffington Island ford now totally blocked, left behind a small rear guard and tried to fight his way northward along the flood plain, hoping to reach yet another ford. It proved to be an exercise in futility, as Morgan's force was split apart by the converging Federal columns and 52 Confederates were killed, with well over one hundred badly wounded in the swirling fighting. Morgan and about 700 men escaped encirclement by following a narrow path through the woods. However, his brother-in-law and second-in-command, Col. Basil W. Duke, was captured, as were over 750 of Morgan's cavalrymen, including his younger brother John Morgan. Duke formally surrendered to Col. Isaac Garrard of the 7th Ohio Cavalry. Morgan's beleaguered troops soon headed upstream for the unguarded ford opposite Belleville, West Virginia, where over 300 men successfully crossed the Ohio River to avoid capture, most notably Col. Adam \\"Stovepipe\\" Johnson and famed telegrapher George Ellsworth. General Morgan, who was halfway across the ford, noted with dismay that his remaining men were trapped on the Ohio side as the Federal gunboats suddenly loomed into view. He wheeled his horse midchannel and rejoined what was left of his column on the Ohio riverbank. Over the next few days, they failed to find a secure place to cross the river, and Morgan's remaining force was captured on July 26 in northern Ohio following the Battle of Salineville. Many of those captured at Buffington Island were taken via steamboat to Cincinnati as prisoners of war, including most of the wounded. Morgan and most of his officers were confined to the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus. Morgan, Thomas Hines, and a few others would later escape and return safely to Kentucky. Battlefield preservation Comparatively little changed on the Buffington Island battlefield in the first century after the fighting; the only substantial difference was the placement of a stone obelisk marking the battle. In 1929, the Ohio Historical Society took ownership of the property.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 985-986. In 1970, the battlefield was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Embracing approximately near the river, the designated portion of the battlefield was the county's first location to be recognized as this type of historic site. There are threats to the site as gravel mining operations have been allowed. The current organization working to preserve the battlefield is the Buffington Island Battlefield Preservation Foundation.

Ryo finds Shizuko at a skateboarding park and a chase ensues, but she escapes in disguise. Shizuko boards a luxury cruise liner, the Fuji Maru, with the ticket she found in the suit she stole. Kaori also boards the ship with her lustful cousin while Ryo sneaks inside to follow her. A terrorist gang led by MacDonald have plans to hijack it and take the rich passengers hostage with Police Officer Saeko Nogami and her buxom sidekick in pursuit. Staying next door from each other, Shizuko overhears MacDonald's plan. MacDonald discovers her and sends one of his men to kill her, but she knocks him out and escapes. She then bumps into the ship's first officer, who takes her to the boiler room and reveals himself as a terrorist. When he attempts to silence Shizuko, Ryo, who had been staying there since his encounter with Kaori and her cousin at the swimming pool, saves her.

In Taiwan, where it released in January 1993, it was the ninth highest-grossing film of the year, with (US$1,824,328). In South Korea, the film sold 808,329 tickets and grossed . Combined, the film grossed a total of approximately in East Asia. Home media On 23 April 2001, a DVD was released by Hong Kong Legends in the United Kingdom in Region 2. Two years later, Fortune Star released a 3 disc set on 29 December 2003 with two other martial arts films: Story of Ricky and The Dragon from Russia. In the United States, the first DVD release was a port of the Mega Star Region 0 release repackaged by Tai Seng. Later on, 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released a region 1 DVD in 2004 utilizing the remastered Fortune Star transfer. It was released again in 2012 by Shout Factory in a double feature single disc with Battle Creek Brawl on both DVD and Blu-ray. All currently available versions restore a scene that was removed from both the theatrical release as well as the LaserDisc versions of the film. The scene involves one of Kaori's suitors going on a rant about foreign tourists (to wit, Richard Norton's band of terrorists) and saying that he hopes they die of AIDS in Chinese, only to discover that they understood him very well. The scene was removed because the film's distributors were concerned that foreign audiences might be offended by the homophobic nature of the scene. Critical reception The DVD release received mixed reviews in the early 2000s, with a 43% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Critics praised the action sequences, but criticised the story and slapstick anime style.

They were traditionally occupied in palm tree climbing and toddy tapping.  Etymology  According to a folk etymology is the name Nalavar a corrupted form of Naluvinavar (those who decamped), which they gained after withdrawing from a battle field. Another theory suggest the name is derived from Nalua meaning to climb, in reference to their traditional occupation. It has also been proposed that the name is derived from Naravar (from Naravu, ancient Tamil term for toddy).  History  According to Yalpana Vaipava Malai were the Nalavars originally called Nambis who originally Vanniar chieftains and served as bowmen. The Nambis after withdrawing from a battle, made a living by being hired by the Shanar (caste of palm tree climbers, locally known as Shandrar) and took up the Shanars hereditary occupation as toddy tappers. Through marriage alliances between the Nambis and Shanars, evolved the Nalavar identity. A former subdivision among them were known as Kottai Vayil Nalavar i.e. \\"Nalavars in service of the fort\\". The badge and cattle brand mark of the Nalavars is the bow and arrow. The Nalavar along with the Pallar worship Annamar, their caste deity. Under the Dutch Ceylon was the Thesavalamai law codified. This law allowed landlords to have slaves, and the Nalavars were also employed as agriculture labors, and were classified along with the Koviar and Pallar under the term Adimai (slave).

There are equivalent agencies in other states. Similar to a city council, a board of supervisors has legislative, executive, and quasi-judicial powers. The important difference is that a county is an administrative division of a state, whereas a city is a municipal corporation; thus, counties implement and, as necessary, refine the local application of state law and public policy, while cities produce and implement their own local laws and public policy (subject to the overriding authority of state law). Often they are concerned with the provision of courts, jails, public health and public lands. Legislative powers Boards may pass and repeal laws, generally called ordinances. Depending on the state, and the subject matter of the law, these laws may apply to the entire county or to only unincorporated areas not within the jurisdiction of a city. The board is also responsible for approving the county budget. County governments may collect state taxes and, in some states, they may also levy taxes, such as property or sales tax. In some states, including Michigan, and in some New York counties until recently, county governing boards were composed of township (Michigan) or town (New York) \\"supervisors\\". These are the chief elected officials of each civil township. Boards of Supervisors were originally composed of the various town/township supervisors from across the county. This system gave every township one vote on the county board regardless of its population, resulting in less populous townships having influence in decision-making that was disproportionate to their populations. Both Michigan and New York changed how they elected county boards by dividing counties into single member districts, drawn so that each district has more or less the same sized population or with each township's vote weighted by population, under order from the Warren Court (see Reynolds v. Sims). In Michigan, the new board model was implemented in 1968. The name \\"Board of Supervisors\\" was changed to \\"Board of Commissioners\\" in 1970 to avoid confusion with township government (where the term \\"Supervisor\\" was still used). In New York, the new boards were called \\"county legislatures\\" (and their members, \\"county legislators\\"), but not every county has adopted this system. Those that retained the old boards of supervisors after the 1960s assigned each member a proportional vote based on the population represented. Executive powers Boards oversee county departments. Generally, this is done under the aegis of a county administrator or county executive. The power of the administrator or executive to act independently depends on the county charter. The administrator or executive usually has the authority over the day-to-day operations of the county's departments. Many boards independently appoint department heads, while other boards delegate that authority to the administrator or executive. Some department heads, like the sheriff or district attorney, may be elected separately by the electorate; however, the board still controls these departments' budgets. In the City and County of San Francisco, a consolidated city-county government, the Board of Supervisors does dual duty as a county board of control and a city council, and the mayor is simultaneously city head of government and county executive. Quasi- judicial powers In some states, the board is the final arbiter of decisions made by commissions underneath a board. This often involves land use planning issues. Other states In some states the equivalent body to a Board of Supervisors is called the county council or county commission; for Louisiana parishes, the equivalent body is a Police Jury. In New Jersey, the equivalent is the Board of chosen freeholders, while in Kentucky the equivalent is called the Fiscal Court. In Nebraska, some counties are governed by a board of supervisors while others are governed by a county commission. In New York, counties are governed by a county legislature, a board of representatives, or a board of supervisors. In Pennsylvania, \\"Board of Supervisors\\" is the name of the body governing townships of the second class that have not adopted a home rule charter. By default, a Pennsylvania township board of supervisors consists of three members, elected at large in odd-numbered years to staggered six-year terms. Voters of a township of the second class can vote to expand the board to five members. In contrast, townships of the first class elect a Board of Commissioners, one member from each ward, ranging from 7 to 15 in number.

The island is shared by Currituck County, North Carolina and Virginia Beach, Virginia, bounded by the Currituck Sound, North Landing River, Back Bay, and Knotts Island Bay. Knotts Island is home to Mackay Island National Wildlife Refuge. Knotts Island is only accessible over land from Virginia Beach using Princess Anne Road. The North Carolina Department of Transportation operates a free ferry between Knotts Island and Currituck on the mainland. This island is a hunting and fishing community. It has numerous duck hunting blinds located in the bay as well as on land, and is home to the Swan Island Hunting Club, a guided duck hunting club located across the bay on Swan Island. It is a favorite winter travel destination of artist/painter Bob Timberlake, among others. Over the years, many residents of the former Outer Banks community of Wash Woods, Virginia moved across the sound to settle on Knotts Island. Eventually, Wash Woods became a ghost town, but descendants continue to live on Knotts Island to this day. There are several businesses located on the island. Knotts Island Market is the only general store on the island. There is a restaurant and bar, Bay Villa, commonly referred to as \\"Pearl's\\", in reference to the former owner. Bay Villa is the center for most of the island's watercraft launching due to the boat ramp located adjacent to the main building. It is also the one and only local bar and restaurant. There is also a winery on the Island. Martin Farm and Winery offers waterfront views with a wine tasting room and ‘pick- your-own’ peaches, apples, and muscadine grapes. Farm fresh vegetables are also available throughout the summer. Knotts Island hosts a Peach Festival every year in June.

The concept was acquired by Brinker International, Inc. in August 1995 from Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises. As of June 24, 2015, there were 52 locations throughout 22 states and the District of Columbia. Maggiano's menu features both classic and contemporary recipes; pastas, salads, steaks, seafood, regular chef specials, and specialty desserts. Maggiano's offers lunch or dinner, carryout service, delivery, and banquet spaces for special occasions. Meals can be purchased in single-sized portions or as full multi-course family style meals. In February 2017, they introduced a 7-day-a-week brunch menu. One reason was that previously robust lunch sales were dropping and brunch would make it a more family friendly atmosphere. History Richard Melman expanded LEYE's Italian division in 1991 with the opening of Maggiano's Little Italy in Chicago. According to the company's history, the concept aimed at \\"re-creating the classic pre-World War II dinner house featuring family size portions\\".

The route is roughly U-shaped running mainly along Dundas Street between Dundas West and Broadview stations along subway Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. Route The route starts at Dundas West station on subway Line 2 Bloor–Danforth and goes south along Dundas Street West. The street curves southeast and passes Howard Park. Here it briefly merges with the 506 Carlton line as it passes over a bridge for the main Canadian National Railways line that runs down to Union Station. To the east of the bridge past Lansdowne Avenue it continues on its own again in a roughly south-east direction before turning eastward at Ossington Avenue. Downtown, the route passes subway Line 1 Yonge–University at two stations: St. Patrick station at University Avenue and Dundas station at Yonge Street. It continues east towards Broadview Avenue where it turns north and merges with the 504 King streetcar line. Both streetcar routes end their journey at Broadview station on Line 2 Bloor–Danforth. The route operates seven days a week from early morning to after midnight. During weekday rush hours, day time and early evenings, average service frequency is 5–7 minutes. Saturday daytime services have an average frequency of 5–7 minutes with Sunday daytime service frequency averaging 6–8 minutes. History Just prior to 1966, the east and west ends of Dundas Street were covered by separate streetcar routes. Dundas Street West was served by the pre-1966 Dundas streetcar route running from the Runnymede Loop at Runnymede Road to the City Hall Loop south of Bay and Dundas streets. Dundas Street East was served by part of the now-defunct Harbord streetcar line between Broadview Avenue and Spadina Avenue. The two routes overlapped between Bay Street and Spadina Avenue. When subway Line 2 Bloor–Danforth opened in 1966, the Harbord streetcar route was abandoned, and the Dundas streetcar route was extended eastward onto Dundas Street East and then north on Broadview Avenue to terminate at Broadview station. At the west end of the line, the Dundas streetcar still operated to the Runnymede Loop passing through Dundas West station in both directions. There was still a branch to the City Hall Loop where every second eastbound Dundas streetcar used to terminate and turn back. In 1968, the section of the Dundas streetcar line between Dundas West station and the Runnymede Loop was replaced by the 40 Junction bus. Now, except for the branch to the City Hall Loop, the Dundas route became the same as today's 505 Dundas route. On January 6, 1975, the City Hall Loop was closed due to construction of the Eaton Centre. Any downtown short-turning of eastbound Dundas streetcars was around an on-street loop: south on Church Street, west on Queen Street, north on Victoria Street then west on Dundas Street. On February 18, 2018, the route began being operated with buses instead of streetcars due to a streetcar shortage and to reassign streetcars in order to address crowding on other routes. Streetcar service was originally expected to return on March 29, 2020, but was delayed to complete upgrades to the overhead infrastructure for pantograph operation. On April 20, 2020, Flexity Outlook streetcars went into service on 505 Dundas on the same day that streetcars were withdrawn from 511 Bathurst due to construction projects.

It was formerly a Norman abbey church and was built on the site of a Saxon cathedral. History Nave and east window The Norman leaden baptismal font, 12th century Alexander, Bishop of Lincoln founded Dorchester Abbey in 1140 for the Arrouaisian Order of Augustinian canons (who wore white instead of the black of most Augustinians). Dorchester had been a Roman town and was later adopted by the Mercians. It had been the seat of a bishopric from AD 634 when Pope Honorius I had sent Saint Birinus, its first bishop, to that district, until 1085 when the Mercian See (hitherto at Dorchester) was transferred to Lincoln. The abbey, founded fifty- five years later, was dedicated in honour of Saints Peter and Paul and Birinus. It was richly endowed out of the lands and tithes of the former bishopric, and had twelve parishes subject to it, being included in the Peculiar of Dorchester, until the suppression of peculiars. The first abbot appears to have been Alured, whose name occurs in records from in 1146 and again in 1163. The last was John Mershe, who was elected in 1533, and in the following year subscribed to the king's supremacy, with five of his canons, and was given a pension of £22 a year (). The revenues of the abbey were valued at the time of its suppression at about £220 (). Henry VIII reserved the greater part of the property of the house for a college, erected by him in honour of the Holy Trinity, for a dean and prebendaries; but this was dissolved in the first year of his successor. No register or cartulary of Dorchester Abbey is known to exist, and only a single charter, confirming the donation of a church by King John, is given by Dugdale. Edmund Ashefeld was the first impropriator of the abbey site and precincts, which afterwards passed through various hands. Church Window showing St. Birinus The church of Dorchester Abbey, as it stands today, was built entirely by the Augustinian Canons, although there are traces on the north side of Saxon masonry, probably part of the ancient cathedral. The whole length of the church is , its width and its height . The north transept and its doorway are Norman. The north side of the nave and chancel arch are Early English Gothic. The choir, south side of nave, south aisle are Decorated Gothic. The south porch is late Perpendicular Gothic. The very rich sanctuary, with its highly decorated windows (including the famous east window one known as the Jesse Tree window) and ornately carved sedilia and piscina, dates from 1330. Other fittings include one of the few surviving lead fonts in England, frescoes of 1340 and several monuments, especially the well-known \\"swaggering knight\\" effigy formerly believed to be Sir John Holcombe who died in 1270 but it is more likely that it is William de Valence the Younger (died 1282 at the Battle of Llandeilo Fawr), son of William de Valence, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Over a period of some forty years from 1845, restoration was carried out on an intermittent basis successively under the direction of four architects: James Cranston, William Butterfield, Sir George Gilbert Scott and Joseph Maltby Bignell (from 1878 to 1883). Scott had earlier employed his pupil, Bignell, as clerk of works at Dorchester [from 1859].Dorchester Abbey, Oxfordshire: The Archaeology and Architecture ... by Warwick Rodwell (Oxford: Oxbow Books, 2009) In 1993 a Union Jack that had been draped over the coffins of prisoners of war at Batu Lintang camp, Sarawak, Borneo was placed in the abbey together with two wooden memorial plaques; they had formerly been housed at All Saints Church, Oxford.

The alternative rock band Radiohead used the church to record orchestral sections for their albums Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001). Between 1998 and 2006 the Dorchester Abbey Campaign Committee raised £4,000,000 and this has enabled the Church Council and the Dorchester Abbey Preservation Trust to undertake significant works in the abbey. These include the Cloister Gallery managed by the Dorchester Museum Committee and restoration of medieval and Victorian wall paintings. Dorchester Abbey Museum was longlisted for the Gulbenkian Prize in 2006. The abbey has an improved heating system and a modern kitchen and servery in the Tower room.

Current products that are manufactured at Kegel include lane machines that are cordless and/or run on batteries, which don't require physically moving the lane machine from lane to lane or retracting the heavy cords formerly used to power the machines. The Kustodian Walker Sport Edition is a lane-conditioning machine that is cordless, runs on a battery and automatically \\"walks\\" from lane to lane while conditioning the lanes. Kegel also produces other products such as lane conditioners, lane cleaners, cleaner cloths for machines, FIZZION cleaner, REVIVE bowling ball cleaner and Drop 'N Mop Fizzion all-purpose floor cleaner. Dennis Davis has helped develop and write software for Kegel such as K.O.S.I. Pro lane pattern software, Pocket K.O.S.I. for pocket PC's, C.A.T.S.

In 893, he was appointed margrave in the March of Carinthia and Upper Pannonia by Arnulf of Carinthia, then King of East Francia. Luitpold succeeded the deposed Margrave Engelschalk II of the Wilhelminer family; unlike his predecessors he could extend his power unimpeded by the mighty Margrave Aribo, acquiring numerous counties in Carinthia as well as on the Danube and in the Nordgau around Regensburg from 895 on, and setting himself up as the most prominent of Bavaria's aristocracy. Though he thereby laid the foundations of the renewed stem duchy, it was his son Arnulf the Bad who, based on his father's acquisitions, first assumed the title of a Bavarian duke. As Luitpold remained a loyal supporter of the Carolingian monarch Arnulf of Carinthia and his son Louis the Child, he enjoyed their support and was entrusted with the defence at the Hungarian and Moravian borders. In 898 he fought successfully against Mojmír II, the king of Great Moravia, on behalf of the king's rebellious brother Svatopluk II and forced Mojmír to become a vassal of Arnulf. In 903, Luitpold held the title of a dux Boemanorum, \\"Duke in Bohemia\\". He organised the Frankish defence against the Magyars under Grand Prince Árpád after invading Hungary, on 4 July 907 was killed east of Vienna in the Battle of Pressburg. Marriage and issue Luitpold married Cunigunde of Swabia, daughter of Berthold I, royal Count palatine in Swabia, and sister of Duke Erchanger of Swabia, a member of the Ahalolfing dynasty. After Luitpold's death Cunigunda married King Conrad I of Germany in 913. Luitpold had two sons by her: *Arnulf the Bad, Duke of Bavaria from 907 to 937 *Berthold, Duke of Bavaria from 938 to 948. From his descendants' titles, Luitpold is often called a duke of Bavaria or margrave of Bavaria, the latter title being more accurate to his actual status.

The game was ported to the Amiga and the Super NES. Sega Genesis and Game Gear versions were renamed to S.S. Lucifer: Man Overboard!.  Plot  Players control Kevin Codner, the aquatic hero. After hearing that the SS Lucifer has suffered some sort of mishap (the exact nature of the incident is not made clear in the game. Somehow the captain is shown pulling the plug from his bath, and a fountain of water shoots up and starts flooding the ship.), Kevin gets into a yellow submarine and begins saving the passengers.  Gameplay  Each level has a certain number of passengers on it, and a certain quota to save to pass. Kevin must guide the passengers to their level exit, and then make his way to his own exit. There may be obstacles in the way, and there may also be water pouring into the ship's compartment, forcing the player to play quickly. Kevin surrounded by passengers he has to save Kevin has explosives at his disposal, allowing him to blast open doors or blast apart cargo crates that are blocking the way. There may be gaps that the passengers need to cross to reach their exit. These may be covered by pulling a simple lever and activating the bridge, but other times Kevin will have to build a bridge from cargo crates. There are conveyor belts and magnetic hoists to help in this task, but the conveyor belts may prevent the passengers from reaching their destination also. Kevin will have to find the correct levers to switch the direction of the belts. The passengers do not avoid dangers, and will walk into fires or off platforms and get themselves killed if not guided correctly. Kevin can use his life-boat to give them a little time in the water, but if they have not reached a ladder by the time it deflates, they are back where they started, in the freezing water. If they stay there too long, they will die. There are a few jetpacks that passengers can use for instant escape, but never enough to transport all the passengers. The player must patch up burst pipes spraying scalding steam, prevent passengers from falling into pools of acid, and cover up fires with cargo crates. Reception Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a 6.4 out of 10. They commented that the graphics could be better but that the gameplay is both strategic and addictive.

The original RAT was developed in the basement of Pro Co's Kalamazoo, Michigan facility in 1978. Numerous variations of the original RAT pedal are still being produced today. The pedal has changed in appearance over the years, but its tone has remained largely the same. Pro Co has also introduced variations of the RAT, including the Turbo RAT and the You Dirty RAT, among others. History The origins of the Pro Co \\"The RAT\\" can be traced back to the mid-1970s, when Pro Co engineers Scott Burnham and Steve Kiraly repaired and hot-rodded existing distortion pedals, such as the Dallas Arbiter Fuzz Face. Burnham decided he could build a superior product from the ground up, and designed \\"The RAT\\" pedal. In 1978, \\"The RAT\\" was being built as a custom- order product. Only twelve of these pedals (including one prototype), commonly referred to as the \\"Bud Box\\" RAT, were produced. Each pedal was built in a standard project box, hand painted, and hand drilled. In 1979, Pro Co began mass-producing them. This iteration was built in a custom designed, rectangular sheet-metal enclosure, with an L shaped removable top/back section giving access to the internals. The top panel was labeled with Pro Co Sound \\"The RAT\\" and the three control knobs as Distortion, Tone and Volume. In 1983, Pro Co switched to a smaller, U-shaped enclosure. Finally, in 1988, the RAT2 was introduced, which included an on/off LED. Various RAT2 circuit board layouts and wiring configurations have surfaced in the last few years, including the noted \\"RAT3 version A and B\\" all under the RAT2 moniker. The RAT2 model is still available today, but in 2008 production moved to China and is now manufactured by Neutrik for Pro Co Sound. Other models of RAT products include: * R2DU (1984-1988) * Juggernaut (original) (1979-1981) * RAT2 (1988–present) * Turbo RAT (1989–present) * Vintage RAT Reissue (1991-2005) * BRAT / Roadkill (1997-2001) * Deucetone RAT (2002–present) * Juggernaut (reissue) (2003–present) * 25th Silver Anniversary RAT (2003) * You Dirty RAT (2004–present) * SOLO (2006–present) * '85 Whiteface RAT Reissue (2010)  Circuitry  The Pro Co \\"The RAT\\" is a distortion pedal with a quite simple circuit, which can be broken down into four simpler blocks: distortion stage, tone control, output stage and power supply. The design is based around a single opamp, originally the Motorola LM308 (switched to Texas Instruments OP07DP around 2002-2003). The distortion is produced using a variable gain circuit with diodes shorting the output to ground at a certain voltage level to produce hard clipping of the input waveform. Originally, 1N914 diodes were used, which were later replaced with 1N4148 since RAT2. The 'Turbo RAT' pedal uses red LEDs for this purpose (red LEDs have about a twice as high forward voltage as the original silicon diodes), while the 'You Dirty RAT' pedal uses 1N34A germanium diodes (clipping at a lower forward voltage). The distortion stage is followed by a passive 'reverse' tone filter and volume control. The general design is very similar to the Boss DS-1 distortion pedal. A major difference is the opamp used (the LM308). Known for its poor slew rate, it largely accounts for the sonic difference between the two pedals.

Popular modifications to the RAT The RAT is a popular pedal for modifying. Some of the possible modifications include: * Resistor Mods: The Ruetz RAT mod which involves simply cutting the 47 Ω resistor to disengage half of the drive circuit. Gain is reduced somewhat and the bass is no longer attenuated. Additionally, the 560 Ω resistor controlling the lower half of the distortion filter can receive similar treatment. Either mod will translate to a thicker (fuzz like) bass response at the expense of losing distortion. * Toggle Switches: The Mightier Mouse mod involves a 3-way switch to select between RAT / RAT2 (clipping via silicon diodes), Turbo RAT (clipping via red LEDs), and FAT RAT (MOSFET clipping) modes. It also shows an alternative to the Ruetz RAT mod by using a potentiometer or trimpot to replace the resistor instead of cutting it out of the circuit. * Diode Lift: Removing one of the two (asymmetric clipping) or both (pure opamp clipping) clipping diodes results in a volume boost with a crunchier tone. * Chip Substitutions: The original RAT pedals featured the rare Motorola LM308 opamp, which is now quite expensive to acquire. Recent RAT2 pedals nowawadays feature the widely available Texas Instruments OP07DP. Other opamps that people try, include: the CA3130EZ (MOSFET-based), the NE5535A / NE5534AP (high slew rate, low noise), the LM741 (low drive) and finally the TL071 / TL081 (both BI-FET based). Many RAT modders install an opamp socket to enable easy swapping of opamps, which is similar to what people do with the Ibanez Tube Screamer circuit. * Capacitor Mods: \\"softening\\" ceramic caps replaced with silver mica or metal film caps for better tonal fidelity. These include the 30 pF cap riding the opamp chip and the single 100 pF cap. * Power Jack: 2.1 mm (Roland / BOSS-style) 9 V DC adapter socket mod. Because the tip on the BOSS-style adapter is negative, one needs to install a plastic 2.1 mm socket to avoid shorting out the barrel of the plug against the RAT's steel chassis (note, the official website says it uses a positive tip adapter).

He also made fundamental contributions to statistical methods for geophysics. Bartels was the first President of the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA). With Sydney Chapman, he wrote the influential book Geomagnetism. Life and career Bartels was awarded his Ph.D. from Göttingen in 1923, then worked at the Potsdam magnetic observatory as a post-doctorate. In 1928, he was named professor at Eberswalde, teaching meteorology. He became full professor at Berlin University in 1936, and director of the Potsdam Geophysical Institute. From 1931 until the second year of World War II, he was also a research associate at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. He collaborated with Sydney Chapman to publish the two-volume work Geomagnetism, a definitive reference on geophysics. In 1933, Bartels signed the Vow of allegiance of the Professors of the German Universities and High-Schools to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialistic State. Following the war in 1946, he became professor in Göttingen. He was also a director at the Max Planck Institute for Physics of the Stratosphere (today Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research) between 1955 and 1964. When, in 1958 International Council for Science, created the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), Bartels became chairman of the West-German branch. From 1954 until 1957, he served as first President of the IAGA. Between 1960 and 1963, he was vice-president of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics.A memorial note was published in Meteorologische Rundschau 1964 by Wilfried Schröder. Research Among his contributions was the development of the Kp-index, and he suggested the existence of \\"M-regions\\" on the Sun that resulted in geomagnetic activity. These coronal holes were later confirmed by the Skylab mission. Finally he also helped initiate the International Geophysical Year, which took place in 1957/8. The Bartels' Rotation Number of the Sun based on a regular 27-day cycle is named after him. It is similar to the Carrington rotation which is based on 27.2753 days.

She is the mother of Bruce Wayne, the future Batman, and wife of Dr. Thomas Wayne as well as the paternal grandmother of Damian Wayne. After she and her husband are murdered in a street robbery, her son becomes inspired to fight crime as the vigilante Batman. Background Martha Wayne first appeared in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939) in a story by Bob Kane and Bill Finger which detailed the origin of Batman. Initially little more than a cipher whose death inspired her heroic son, later comics would expand upon her history. Born Martha Kane (a maiden name given in homage to co- creator Bob Kane), Martha was the heir to the Kane Chemical fortune and a member of one of Gotham City's wealthiest families. It has been revealed she is related to both Jacob Kane, his daughter Kate Kane (Batwoman) in Detective Comics #934, and Bette Kane (Flamebird) in Batwoman #25. Despite her Irish- Catholic background, in her youth, Martha had a reputation as a notorious party girl, socialite, and debutante, frequenting all the most prestigious country clubs, night clubs, and soirees. She also had a developed social conscience and often used her family's wealth and status to champion causes and charities. As revealed in the miniseries Batman: Family by John Francis Moore, Martha's closest friend in those days was the woman Celia Kazantkakis. Both were renowned for their beauty, which caught the attention of a gangster named Denholm. Martha dated Denholm for a time prior to meeting Thomas Wayne, though she was unaware of his true nature at the time. Celia, who had had previous dealings with Denholm, became very protective of her friend and conspired to get this thug out of her life.Batman Family #1 (December 2002) In the process it came to light just why Celia was familiar with him. Celia, it turned out, was a criminal herself and had been embezzling money from an orphanage that was one of Martha's charities. She attempted to hide the evidence of this by setting fire to the building but Martha discovered her duplicity. Before Celia departed for her family's home in Greece, Martha threatened to expose her should she ever return to Gotham. Celia would return to Gotham many years later as \\"Athena\\", the leader of a criminal cartel. In this guise, she attempted to stage a coup of Wayne Enterprises, until Batman discovered the true nature of his mother's history with Celia and defeated her. Shortly after Celia's departure, Martha met and fell in love with prominent physician and philanthropist Dr. Thomas Wayne. They were wed soon after and Martha eventually gave birth to their son Bruce Wayne. =Murder= The Wayne family encounters Joe Chill, in Detective Comics #33 (November 1939) When Bruce Wayne was eight years old, his parents took him to a screening of a Zorro movie at a cinema in Gotham's Park Row. Returning to the car through an alley, they were confronted by a lone gunman, who attempted to steal Martha Wayne's pearl necklace, an anniversary gift from Thomas. In the ensuing struggle, the thief shot both the Waynes dead (Later versions of the story claimed that only Thomas was shot; Martha died instead from the \\"shock\\" of his murder due to her having a weak heart. This retcon was ultimately undone, with Martha again being gunned down with Thomas.). In the wake of this tragedy, Park Row was given the nickname \\"Crime Alley\\". The identity of the Waynes' killer has varied through different versions of the Batman story. Initially, he was said to be the criminal Joe Chill. Later retellings would claim that Chill had been hired by gangster Lew Moxon, an enemy of Thomas Wayne, and told to make the killings look like a robbery. After DC Comics' history-altering Zero Hour series, this interpretation was abandoned in favor of the Waynes' deaths being a random street crime. The killer was thought to have never been caught, adding to the tragedy and universality of Batman's origin. After the further continuity tweaks of the Infinite Crisis miniseries, DC has once again returned to the Joe Chill interpretation. Since her death, Martha Wayne has only appeared in the Batman series in flashback and in the occasional out-of- body experience or hallucination. Her most significant appearance in this latter category is in the miniseries Batman: Death and the Maidens by Greg Rucka. In this story, Batman ingests an elixir given to him by his enemy Ra's al Ghul, and believes he is having a conversation with his dead parents. Martha is depicted here as a beautiful woman whose face is marred by a bleeding bullet wound, suggesting that Bruce remembers her this way because he has become 'focused' on her death rather than her life, the wound vanishing after she forces him to acknowledge that issue. Martha strongly disapproves of her son's costumed crusade, fearing he has thrown away his chance for happiness, although her husband notes that they disapprove of what being Batman has cost Bruce rather than disapproving of Batman himself. As she and Thomas depart, they assure Bruce that just because the passing of time has lessened his grief does not mean that he no longer cares for them, and, as a result, Bruce is able to accept that he is Batman because he chooses to be, not because he has to be. In Jeph Loeb's Batman stories, Bruce feels responsible for his parents' murder because he advised Martha to wear the infamous pearl necklace the night she was murdered. Had she not worn it, the mugger might have not killed them, or even have been attracted to them. In Death and the Maidens she claims that the pearls were fakes, and that she wouldn't have worn real ones simply to go to the theater. As this experience may have been merely a hallucination, it is unknown whether or not this is true. =Alleged double life= Another mystery about Martha Wayne's final fate is unveiled in the Batman R.I.P. storyline, where it is revealed that the Kanes hired a detective to prowl about the circumstances of her death, always suspecting that Thomas Wayne married her for her money. Many years later, the detective hired by the Kanes presents to Commissioner Gordon a dossier describing Martha as a helpless, frail woman hooked on drugs by an abusive husband, who frequently indulged in orgies and extramarital affairs, taking Alfred Pennyworth as her lover. However, the villainous Simon Hurt, head of the Black Glove cabal, bent on getting revenge on Batman admits that the stories and supposed evidence are clever forgeries designed to break Batman. =Streets of Gotham= In the series Streets of Gotham, Martha Wayne's history as a young woman was revised and elaborated further. After her father was tricked into a shady investment deal by a mobster named Judson Pierce, which drained the Kane fortune and made him suffer a fatal heart attack, Martha became involved with charity work focusing on Gotham's poorest citizens. One of her main projects was raising support for the free clinic founded in Gotham's slums by doctor Leslie Thompkins. During an attempt to solicit support from Gotham's elite, she had her first encounter with Thomas Wayne. Aside from being a well-regarded surgeon, Thomas was also an infamous playboy and party animal. He affirmed this reputation by being extremely drunk in public and vomiting on Martha's shoes, causing her to storm off in disgust despite his apologies. Leslie's clinic also became a new target for Judson Pierce after he deemed it a key point for taking over the surrounding neighborhood. Pierce attempted to prey on Martha's poverty by offering cash to shut the facility down. Martha accepted Pierce's money, but filed it as a donation to keep the clinic running. Enraged, Pierce arranged to have Martha and Leslie assassinated. Martha met Thomas Wayne a second time after he had Alfred chauffeur him to the clinic so he could apologize again. That same evening though, Pierce's hitmen also decided to make their move. Alfred was able to subdue the assailants, but not before Leslie suffered a minor gunshot wound. While Leslie recovered from her injury, Thomas volunteered to work in the clinic alongside Martha. Thomas became content with the work there and it wasn't long before Thomas and Martha became romantically involved. By the time Leslie returned to work, Thomas became an official sponsor of the clinic and used his vast resources to keep it running. Thomas also distanced himself from his hedonistic past, citing Martha as his inspiration to change. =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Martha Wayne is seen as a good, strong-willed mother worried about her child's future and the future of Gotham's children as well. It is claimed that while Bruce was three years-old, Martha was pregnant with a second child named Thomas Wayne Jr. Due to an accident orchestrated by the Court of Owls, the child was born prematurely and supposedly sent to Willowwood Asylum in order to heal. After the murder of Thomas and Martha, the asylum ceased to receive proper funding and the staff started to abuse the children in their care. At some point in time, the Court of Owls offers a child that is possibly Thomas Jr. to become a part of them and he goes up Gotham's ranks with the false-identity of a rich Gotham socialite and mayor candidate, called Lincoln March. Thomas Jr/Lincoln holds Bruce directly responsible for their parents' murders and the life he went through, and has a burning desire for revenge against his brother. Whether Lincoln really is Bruce's brother or a ploy set by the Court of Owls in order to enlist him in their ranks is unresolved, with Bruce acknowledging that the evidence favoring March being Thomas Junior makes sense but certain that his parents would have told him if he had a brother, records stating that Thomas Junior died twelve hours after he was born even if another child was admitted to the orphanage with injuries matching what Thomas Junior would have suffered from. Other versions =Superman: Red Son= In Mark Millar's Superman: Red Son, Martha and her husband are anti-communist protesters in the Soviet Union. They are executed by the NKVD under Commissar Pyotr Roslov, which leads to their son vowing to overthrow the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. =Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty= Thomas and Martha Wayne in Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty (November 1997); art by Scott Hampton In Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty, Thomas and Martha are saved from death when 'Valentin Sinclair' — really Vandal Savage, a man who has a long-standing interest and admiration for the Wayne family despite the fact that they often end up opposing him when they learn about his plans — scared off Joe Chill, Sinclair becoming a partner in Wayne Enterprises, only for Sinclair to have them killed when they threaten to expose his plan to divert a meteor that gave him his powers back to Earth so that he can study it. Their deaths — triggered by Sinclair's fear-inducing henchman Scarecrone causing them to remember the mugging, driving them to flee Chill by running off their balcony — prompt Bruce to become Batman to investigate, Gordon having written their deaths off as an accident and Bruce unwilling to investigate as himself because of the risk to his new wife, Julie Madison. =Flashpoint= Flashpoint universe; art by Dave Johnson The alternate universe Flashpoint version of Martha Wayne is the Joker (and even resembles Heath Ledger's portrayal as seen in The Dark Knight). After Bruce Wayne is shot and killed by Joe Chill, Martha is unable to cope with her loss so she cuts open her cheeks to create a faux smile. As Joker, she is the nemesis of Batman and uses Yo-Yo as a henchman. She kidnaps Harvey Dent's son and daughter. Joker kills James Gordon after she tricks Gordon into shooting Harvey's daughter (disguised as the Joker). After Dent's son and daughter are saved, Batman confronts Joker about their son's death. As Batman has recently met Barry Allen, Martha learns that there is a way to rewrite history where Bruce will live although they will die. Realizing that her son will be Batman in that timeline, Martha flees in horror, falling to her death in the caverns below Wayne Manor. =Planetary= In an alternate universe ruled by the tyrannical 'Planetary' organization, Martha and her husband were part of a makeshift 'League of Justice', an underground cell trying to revolt. They were murdered by Elijah Snow.\\"Planetary JLA: Terra Occulta\\" One-Shot (November 2002) =Earth One= In the graphic novel Batman: Earth One, Martha's maiden name was Arkham instead of Kane in this alternate continuity. Martha's father was murdered by her mother when she was twelve, leaving her family with a series of scandals, including a rumor that the Arkham bloodline is peremptorily insane. Martha was a campaign manager of her husband's mayoral campaign against Oswald Cobblepot. Cobblepot had planned to have a corrupt cop, Jacob Weaver, murder Thomas, but a mugger got to her family first and killed both her and her husband, leaving Bruce orphaned. =Holy Terror= In the Elseworlds novel Batman: Holy Terror Martha works with Thomas and other medical professionals in an underground clinic treating victims of the religious theocracy that rules most of the planet. In one example she makes note of a man that had been tortured to try to change his homosexuality. =The New 52: Earth 3= Martha Wayne's Earth 3 counterpart is featured in Forever Evil. In the revised Earth 3 alternate universe of \\"The New 52\\", all characters from the mainstream universe have corresponding counterparts albeit these counterparts are either a darker or outright evil version of the character. Martha is the abusive and sadistic mother of Owlman, in contrast to Batman's mother being a kind woman who fought against child abuse and corruption. Martha blames her husband's surgical fetish for the family's huge expenses, despite the fact that she herself frequently indulges in the family fortune. Owlman orchestrates his parents' murder with the Alfred of Earth 3. Owlman later wonders why Batman would dedicate his life to avenging his parents' deaths. =DC Comics Bombshells= In the opening of the first issue of the comic DC Comics Bombshells, set in an alternate history 1940, Martha and Thomas Wayne's lives are saved by an already-existing Batwoman. In other media =Television= Live action * Martha Wayne appears on the Fox TV series Gotham, portrayed by actress Brette Taylor. Her and Thomas Wayne's murder is the main focus of the show's first season.A Double Murder In Gotham's Past And A Grundy In Arrow's Future (UPDATE) Their murder was first seen in the pilot episode where they are gunned down by a masked man in shiny shoes. This murder was witnessed by Selina Kyle. The episode \\"Ace Chemicals\\" revealed that Jeremiah Valeska had abducted a husband and wife who had the same bone structure and build as Thomas and Martha Wayne where he had Mad Hatter hypnotize them and a doctor that works for him do plastic surgery on them. This is part of Jeremiah's plot to re-enact the night when Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered. When it came to the murder in the alley, Jeremiah had already killed the doubles after they served their purpose and replaced them with a brainwash James Gordon and Leslie Thompkins with the hypnosis ending when the pearls hit the ground upon their death. This murder attempt was thwarted by Selina Kyle. * A photo of Martha appears in Wayne Manor in Titans. * Emma Paetz portrays Martha Kane in the prequel series Pennyworth as part of the main cast. Animation * Martha Wayne appears in The Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians episode \\"The Fear\\", voiced by Lucy Lee. She is depicted in a flashback sequence which was the first depiction of Batman's origin outside of the DC Comics. * Martha Wayne is referenced in The Batman. Martha is murdered with Thomas Wayne after watching the film The Cloaked Rider with her son but the gunman is never caught. In the episode \\"The Big Chill\\", Bruce Wayne has a nightmare in which she and Thomas are murdered by Victor Fries. In the episode \\"Artifacts\\" (set in the distant future), Archaeologists mistakenly believe Martha to have been Batwoman while her husband was Batman and their son was the Red Robin. * Martha Wayne appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Pat Musick (in \\"Dawn of the Deadman!\\") and by Julie Newmar (in \\"Chill of the Night!\\"). She appears as a ghost in the episode \\"Dawn of the Deadman!\\". The character has a more central role in the episode \\"Chill of the Night!\\", where the Phantom Stranger takes Batman back in time to a costume party Martha and Thomas Wayne attended. Martha (dressed in a butterfly-like costume) is hugged by Batman. When Lew Moxon holds Martha hostage, Batman and Thomas team up to fight and defeat the gang of robbers, thus Batman learns new information about Martha's and Thomas's murder. * Martha Wayne appears in Beware the Batman. In the episode \\"Monsters\\", Martha appears in a flashback sequence where she and her husband are shot and killed in front of Bruce Wayne. * Martha Wayne appears in the Batman Black and White motion comics, voiced by Janyse Jaud. =DC Animated Universe= * Martha Wayne featured in Batman: The Animated Series, voiced by Adrienne Barbeau (in \\"Perchance to Dream\\" [albeit uncredited]). In this version, Martha and her husband Thomas Wayne are murdered in Crime Alley by an unidentified murderer. The murder is only occasionally alluded via nightmares. In the episode \\"Dreams in Darkness\\", Batman is drugged with the Scarecrow's fear toxin and sees his parents walking towards a tunnel then runs towards them, telling them to stop. They enter the tunnel, which is revealed to be the barrel of a giant gun, dripping blood. Batman screams as the world is bleached white and a loud shot is heard. In the episode \\"Two-Face\\", Batman failed to save the titular villain in a nightmare while Martha and Thomas also look on. In the episode \\"Perchance to Dream\\", Martha is briefly seen alive in the Mad Hatter's dream sequence. The series also makes use of the rose motif that the films Batman and Batman Forever associate with the murder. Bruce Wayne leaves roses at the site of his parents' murder on the event's anniversary (as similarly done in the comics). * Martha Wayne has a non-voiced cameo appearance in Justice League Unlimited. In the episode \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\", Batman experiences an hallucination via an extraterrestrial plant to which Martha and her son watch her husband fighting back against Joe Chill but eventually the true memory returns. =Film= Live action =Batman (1989 film series)= * Martha Wayne (credited as \\"Mrs. Wayne\\") appeared in Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, portrayed in flashback by Sharon Holm. In this version, she and her husband are killed by Jack Napier, when they are ambushed in an alley by the gangster's gang. * Martha Wayne appeared in Joel Schumacher's Batman Forever, played by Eileen Seeley in a flashback. =The Dark Knight Trilogy= * Sara Stewart played Martha Wayne in Batman Begins (2005). In this version, the Waynes are killed by Joe Chill after exiting the opera Mefistofele and after the bat-like performers frighten her son due to a strong fear of bats. * In The Dark Knight Rises (2012), Selina Kyle steals Martha Wayne's pearl necklace which prompts Bruce Wayne to track the thief down. Bruce eventually reclaims Martha's necklace from Selina, but this only incites Selina to steal Bruce's car in revenge. At the end of the film, the pearls are seen on Selina's neck, implying that Bruce must've given his mother's possession to Selina. =DC Extended Universe= * Lauren Cohan portrays Martha Wayne in the 2016 film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. During the opening credits, Martha tried to fight the mugger after Thomas gets shot to protect their son only to be killed herself. The mugger's gun gets stuck in her pearl necklace, and its recoil damages the necklace. Before dying, her husband yells out her name after seeing her corpse. When Batman and Superman clash due to Lex Luthor's manipulations, Batman spares Superman when Superman asks Batman to \\"save Martha\\" due to the memories of his own mother and Lois Lane mentioning that Superman's mother is also named Martha. DC Black *Carrie Louise Putrello plays the character in the live-action film Joker which is set outside of the DCEU. Animation * Martha Wayne appears in a portrait shown several times in Batman: Mask of the Phantasm with her husband Thomas Wayne. The film deals with Bruce Wayne's chance at a happy life being Batman and the struggle with the possibility of breaking the self-imposed promise to his parents. When this chance is crushed, the film cuts to the portrait before cutting to Batman's first donning of the cape and cowl. * Martha Wayne is referenced several times in The Batman vs. Dracula alongside Thomas Wayne. * Martha Wayne appears on the direct-to-DVD animated anthology film Batman: Gotham Knight, voiced by Andrea Romano. She appears in a brief flashback shown in the opening of the final segment \\"Deadshot\\" seen screaming before being shot. * The Flashpoint iteration of Joker has a cameo appearance in Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox, voiced by Grey DeLisle (albeit uncredited). In the distorted Flashpoint timeline, Martha Wayne loses her mind after her child's death; Martha's \\"Joker smile\\" was from her son's blood as her sorrow turns into insane laughter. Batman later fights Yo-Yo for the Joker's whereabouts and also compares Eobard Thawne's deranged psychosis to the Joker's insanity. * In The Lego Batman Movie, a photo of Martha Wayne, Thomas Wayne, and a young Bruce Wayne is seen when Bruce talks to his dead parents in front of the picture stating that he saved Gotham City again. * Martha Wayne appears in DC Super Heroes vs. Eagle Talon, voiced by Asa Ueno. * Martha Wayne appears briefly in a flashback of Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. =Video games= * Martha Wayne appears in Batman: Dark Tomorrow, voiced by Erin Quinn Purcell. * Martha Wayne appears in flashbacks in Batman: The Telltale Series, voiced by Lorri Holt. In the game's continuity, her husband Thomas Wayne had criminal ties to Carmine Falcone and Hamilton Hill, acting as a launderer for the groups money. They seized a lot of their power in Gotham by committing those who stand in their way to Arkham Asylum, injecting them with a psychosis inducing chemical to render them insane. Martha's level of involvement with Thomas' criminal activities is unclear. Once she discovered the full extent of his crimes, she became disgusted and resolved to gather enough evidence to get Thomas put in prison. Mayor Hill discovered her plan and sent Joe Chill to kill her and Thomas. Batman Arkham Martha Wayne is featured in the Batman Arkham series where she is voiced by Tasia Valenza and Andrea Deck. * In Batman: Arkham Asylum, under the Scarecrow's fear toxin influence, Batman experiences flashbacks of his parents' murder. A bench in Arkham Asylum dedicated to Martha (and Thomas Wayne) is the answer to one of the Riddler's riddles which leads to Thomas and Martha's unlockable bio. * In Batman: Arkham City, the Monarch Theatre (the site the murders) is featured in Arkham City. Behind the building is the chalk outline of Thomas Wayne's and Martha's bodies with a bouquet of flowers and Hugo Strange's tape with a taunting message lying by the outlines. The player has the option of paying his respects by having Batman kneeling by the outlines of both. The chalk outlines lasted for so many years, although it is implied by the message that Strange was the one who staged the scenario to torment Batman. Later while succumbing to the Joker's poison, Batman has a hallucination outside the League of Assassins' temple in which his mother appeared standing inside a tunnel to come into the light with her. * She is alluded in Batman: Arkham Origins. Following the Joker's capture at the Royal Hotel, Batman has a vision of Crime Alley which actually shows Thomas Wayne and then Martha being gunned down by a mugger. The site of the Wayne murders can be found in Park Row's Crime Alley behind the Monarch Theatre. Martha's and Thomas's pair chalk outlines are present along with a single rose. During one of Batman's detective missions, the Dark Knight has to investigate the murders of two acquaintances at Crime Alley, only a few feet from his parents' chalk outline. While reconstructing the crime with Detective Vision, if the player watches the Waynes' chalk outlines, their corpses will appear for a brief moment. * She is alluded once again in Batman: Arkham Knight. First as a hallucination from the Scarecrow's fear toxin and also since \\"Martha\\" is Batman's password to activate the \\"Knightfall Protocol\\" which caused Wayne Manor to self-destruct. * Martha also appears in Batman: Arkham VR. =Novels= In Andrew Vachss' novel Batman: The Ultimate Evil, Batman discovers that, prior to her death, Martha fought against sex trafficking and child sexual abuse, heading a covert detection agency with help from Commissioner Gordon and the family butler Alfred Pennyworth. Batman also discovers that his parents' murder was not a random mugging, but was in fact orchestrated by a pedophile ring that Martha was investigating.

It was originally published in 1980. Another version appeared as 3-part serial in Analog as A Spaceship for the King from December 1971 to February 1972. The novel forms part of Pournelle's Future History known as the CoDominium Series. Chronologically, it is second to last in the series, contemporaneous with events in The Mote in God's Eye. In content it resembles Pournelle's military fiction series Falkenberg's Legion, also from the CoDominium series: both depict a capable military leader undertaking a campaign on a backward planet. In this case the leader is from a planet that has recovered technologically to the steam, steel and coal stage, who visits a planet of city states surrounded by barbarians, fighting with medieval weapons. The story shows the conflicting motives of the different factions without demonizing any of them, save possibly the merchants' faction whose motives are to use the forces of the Imperial Space Navy to enhance their own profits. Plot summary A planet called 'Prince Samual's World' had been bombed heavily during the Secession Wars and had spent about 400 years in isolation. As a result, much of the technological knowledge of the First Empire was lost on the planet; when Second Empire ships found the planet, its technological level was somewhere around that of 19th century Europe. For years, Colonel Nathan \\"Iron\\" MacKinnie had been famous on the planet for his masterful defense of the city-state republic of Orleans against the expansionist kingdom of Haven (ruled by King David). After allying with the Second Empire, Haven embarked on a new unification campaign, and MacKinnie set up a decisive battle that, had Orleans won, would have broken Haven. However, unknown to MacKinnie, the new Haven campaign was a lure to get Orleans' forces into the field, so that the Second Empire's more advanced weaponry (including spaceships) could destroy them. These weapons quickly killed most of Orleans' troops, as well as MacKinnie's fiancée. After the loss of its army, Orleans was forced to surrender, and MacKinnie was then pensioned off by the Haven authorities. Months later, drinking in a Haven tavern with his former top sergeant, Hal Stark, MacKinnie overheard a drunken Imperial officer boast of having been on Makassar, a nearby primitive planet that had a store of First Empire knowledge in a surviving building that locals treated as a temple. Leaving the tavern, MacKinnie and Stark were arrested by the Haven secret police and taken to see their leader, Citizen Malcolm Dougal (who was secretly a key advisor to King David, although without official government portfolio). Dougal had learned through his spy network (and told MacKinnie) that under Imperial law, planets without manned space travel at the time of assimilation into the Second Empire became colonies, governed by outworlders and at the mercy of the Imperial Traders Association; but planets with manned space travel, even primitive space travel, became self-governing. Dougal thus offered MacKinnie an opportunity to go to Makassar disguised as a merchant/trader, to locate and return with information from the library to help Haven build a spaceship. Dougal also told MacKinnie that every non- Imperial in the tavern who may have heard the Imperial officer's remarks had been killed, except for MacKinnie and Stark. To save both Stark's life and his own, MacKinnie accepted. With Stark and a company of Haven agents not known to the Imperials, including Mary Graham, a young woman with a university education (highly unusual for Haven), MacKinnie boarded a ship of the Imperial Traders Association as the leader a merchant company looking for trade opportunities on Makassar. McKinnie's company was restricted to arming themselves with medieval chain mail, shields and swords, because Imperial law mandated that no more advanced technology may be introduced to a more primitive planet, and were fitted with Imperial space suits for the trip. Reaching Makassar, MacKinnie and his company found few trade goods in the main city, because it was blockaded on both land and sea, which Dougal had anticipated would be the case, giving the company an excuse to travel to Batav, the city where the First Empire library/temple was located. MacKinnie, with the help of a former Haven Navy commander in his company, bought and refitted a sailing ship with leeboards. (Although a primitive technology to Imperials, leeboards were an advanced one in Makassar terms (which the Imperials failed to appreciate) that would allow their ship to travel much faster than any other on the planet.) MacKinnie's ship then outran most of the blockading pirate ships and soon arrived in Batav, which was under the control of \\"temple\\" high priests who were themselves besieged by vast hordes of barbarian horsemen. There were also Second Empire missionaries stranded in Batav, who believed that the Traders allowed them to travel to Batav because the killing of Imperial missionaries would provide a pretext for Imperial intervention on Makassar. MacKinnie convinced the high priests to let him recruit Batav citizens into an army to defeat the barbarians. He then maneuvered the most intelligent and suspicious of the high priests and Temple guards into a suicide mission, while his army defeated the barbarians by utilizing superior tactics. He used the resulting power vacuum to install the Second Empire missionaries as Batav's new religious leaders. The grateful clerics were unexpectedly supportive of MacKinnie's secret mission and were willing to allow MacKinnie's company full access to the library archives. One of MacKinnie's men was a physicist chosen for his eidetic memory, to research early plans for space travel. During this period, after an unsuccessful assassination attempt on MacKinnie by the barbarians (which wounded Stark), MacKinnie and Mary Graham, who served as commander of the commissary for MacKinnie's army, secretly became lovers. MacKinnie and company (minus the injured Stark, who remained on Makassar as commander of the army in MacKinnie's name) then returned to Prince Samual's World. Back in Haven, Dougal's men used the acquired knowledge to build a primitive manned spaceship, adopting a low-tech design of Robert Goddard—a rapid firing cannon using high-explosive shells detonating behind the ship to provide propulsion (but which might blow up the ship). Because the ship would not be airtight, only members of MacKinnie's company (who still had their space suits) could pilot it, and because it would only be able to carry a minimal payload, Graham (the lightest of the company) volunteered and was chosen as pilot. Before the launch, MacKinnie proposed to her, and she accepted. As soon as Prince Samual's World was unified, and in the presence of unsuspecting Imperial witnesses, Graham's ship was launched and achieved orbit, although it could not re-enter the atmosphere (meaning that the Imperials had to rescue Graham). King David then immediately requested that Prince Samual's World be admitted to the Second Empire as a self-governing world capable of manned space travel, not as a colony. The Imperials eventually conceded the self-governing issue, but they realized that MacKinnie and Graham (who have now become the most famous couple on the planet) were part of a Dougal plot to acquire knowledge from the First Empire library during the Makassar trip, which embarrassed the Imperial Navy. The Navy officers insisted that MacKinnie and Graham, at least, be visibly punished, while the Imperial political representatives wanted to give Makassar a chance to continue to develop independently. Using the pretext of Graham's illegal introduction of new technology - wooden horse collars - on Makassar, the political representatives offered MacKinnie and Graham exile on Makassar as punishment (while reminding them that Dougal was likely to execute them due to their fame), and they accepted. References to technology In the novel, Graham introduced rigid wooden horse collars to Makassar to improve the efficiency of her commissary with the limited number of horses she had. Although this seemed like a trivial improvement, this was a disruptive technology on Makassar, because Makassar society still used slaves as draft animals. Makassar could not exploit the full ability of horses with its current technology: simple harnesses fastened around the neck. Each horse eats as much as five men and so must perform better than five men to be worth using, but it could not with a simple harness. However, with a wooden collar shifting the pulled weight to its shoulders, a horse could pull ten times as much as a man at high speed. The effect of this would be either to render a large number of slaves useless, or to free them for other uses. Either way, the economic structure of the society would change radically, and with it the political and power structure.

A custom house was typically located in a seaport or in a city on a major river, with access to an ocean. These cities acted as a port of entry into a country. Due to advances in electronic information systems, the increased volume of international trade, and the introduction of air travel, the term \\"custom house\\" became a historical anachronism. There are many examples of buildings around the world that were formerly used as custom houses but have since been converted for other uses, such as museums or civic buildings. , the Custom House of Valletta in Malta is still used for its originally built purpose. In the United Kingdom, since 1386, the phrase \\"custom house\\" has been in use over the term \\"customs house\\". This was after the City of London's Custom House was erected at Wool Wharf in Tower Ward, to house just the officials overseeing the Great Custom on Wool and Woolfells.

Duna has been the national main channel of the public media MTVA since 15 March 2015. Duna TV is managed and primarily funded by the Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (, abbreviated MTVA). This government organization, formed in 2011, also manages the public service broadcasters Magyar Televízió and Magyar Rádió as well as the Hungarian news agency Magyar Távirati Iroda. On 1 July 2015, Duna TV as well as the media channels of three other public media organizations managed by the MTVA were merged into a single organization called Duna Media Service (). This organization is the legal successor to Duna TV and is an active member of the European Broadcasting Union.  History  Duna TV went on the air in December 1992 as the first Hungarian TV station to broadcast over satellite. Its mission is to create and broadcast programming for and news about Hungarian minority communities beyond Hungary's borders in order to help maintain their national/ethnic identity. A few years later, Duna TV became the first Hungarian station to broadcast 24 hours a day. In 2004, Duna TV began to broadcast in North America, South America and Australia. In 2006, Duna TV started its Channel II (Autonomy TV, today Duna World). Duna TV had been originally funded from a television licence fee imposed on owners of television sets. However, in July 2002, the government abolished the fee and began to partially fund the broadcaster through direct payments, with additional funding coming from advertising and commercial activities. In 2010, after Magyar Televízió withdrew from the Eurovision Song Contest that year due to financial reasons, Duna TV attempted to move from an approved participant to an active member of the European Broadcasting Union in order to continue Hungary's participation in the event. While a decision ultimately was not made in time for Duna TV to participate, Duna TV did air the 2010 contest. Magyar Televízió returned for the 2011 contest. In 2011, most of the assets and employees of Duna TV were made a part of the newly created Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (, abbreviated MTVA), a government organization controlled by the Media Council of Hungary. Magyar Televízió and Magyar Rádió were also made a part of MTVA, unifying all three public service broadcasters in Hungary for the first time. Additionally, the Hungarian news agency Magyar Távirati Iroda was merged into the MTVA and has since been responsible for the production of all news content aired on the three broadcasting organizations. Duna TV's membership in the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) was elevated from approved participant to active status in 2014 following the establishment of an agreement between the EBU, Hungarian public service broadcasters, and MTVA that enabled the EBU to treat Duna TV, Magyar Televízió, and Magyar Rádió as a single unit for membership purposes. As part of its overhaul revamp for all of its MTVA channels in 2015, Duna began broadcasting all of its entertainment and current affairs content from M1, starting with the Eurovision Song Contest, but they retain its original structure as they continue to serve the Hungarian minorities. Another consequence of the 2015 MTVA revamp of public media services in Hungary saw Duna TV merged with Magyar Televízió, Magyar Rádió, and Magyar Távirati Iroda to create a single organization called Duna Media Service (). This nonprofit organization is the legal successor to each of the four formerly separate entities managed by the MTVA.  Regional studios  The station is broadcast from Budapest, but has regional studios in Cluj-Napoca (Kolozsvár), Târgu Mureș (Marosvásárhely), and Odorheiu Secuiesc (Székelyudvarhely) in Romania; Bratislava (Pozsony) in Slovakia; Subotica (Szabadka) in Serbia; Uzhhorod (Ungvár) in Ukraine, and other places.

This can be loss of the asset directly, or loss of the ability to render service to customers that is enabled by the asset. For example, the business may have a few critical tools, and the loss of just one of these tools would significantly degrade the ability to perform necessary work. Thus, the assets being tracked may a) have specific quantifiable capital value or b) general aggregate operational value. Examples for such assets include * beer kegs, * intermediate bulk containers (IBCs) used in the food and chemical industries, * racks for glass and automotive parts, * unit load devices (ULDs) used in the airline industry. * Line-replaceable unit LRUs of in-field operational installations * rolling cages, * collapsible aluminum containers for raw materials, * portable surgical instruments * medical devices in hospitals and subject of repetitive certification. = Non-Asset Mobile Tracking Applications = Persons may be tracked within a controlled geographical area; e.g. hospital patients, visitors in a secure facility, or workers in power plants, chemical plants, or tunnel construction sites. People can be actively tracked to locate them reliably and quickly in the unfortunate case of disaster.Making Business Sense of Real Time Location Systems (RTLS), RFID Radio Person-tracking is a highly specialized application that requires special-purpose technology, and is only workable within a specific, controlled environment. Tracking an individual person in an open, uncontrolled environment without special instrumentation is not realistically possible. = Concerns with usage of tracking mobile assets = These assets are often in the hands of third party entities (such as suppliers, customers, logistics providers and carriers) and out of sight and control of the owning entity. They usually represent a significant capital expenditure for companies and their management and maintenance is resource-intensive. On average, businesses spend 5% of annual revenue on logistics assets, and almost one-fifth of respondents spend more than 10%.RFID-Enabled Logistics Asset Management: Improving Capital Utilization, Increasing Availability, and Lowering Total Operational Costs, Aberdeen Group. Accessed 15 September 2006. The annual costs include the replacement of lost or damaged special containers, where typically up to 30% of the containers are surplus in circulation just because nobody knows when and where. = Outsourcing mobile asset management = Mobile asset management providers manage asset operation within the supply chain, directing the activities of a client’s third party logistics company as needed and ensure proper services are performed on the asset (handling, cleaning, maintenance, repair). These providers also study business processes within the supply chain and help optimize each process.  Methods of tracking  Different methods exist to track and manage mobile assets. Today, companies use labor-intensive manual processes to track assets between manufacturers and distributors, which can result in higher supply chain costs and processes that are less reliable due to natural human error. Specific identification of the container’s origin and destination is virtually impossible under this method. = Components of mobile asset management = Mobile asset management solutions can include one or more of these parts: * Server unit * Database unit * Wireless tags for the units * Illumination bases for wireless communications (GSM) * Locating receivers (GPS) = Asset tracking technology = More sophisticated mobile asset management companies use the most advanced means of tracking assets available today, such as radio-frequency identification. RFID automatically captures data on each individual container and can indicate container contents without ever having to open the container. This technology is also combined with software applications that collect, maintain, track and analyze the data and provide customized reporting of the location, status, and audit and maintenance history of each asset. For example, Wayne Memorial hospital has saved $300,000 by tracking for infusion pumps with RFID technology that can piggyback on the Wi-Fi system already in place. That system is known as \\"Active\\" RFID because it uses tags that have batteries and constantly beacon. The most popular form of Asset Tracking using RFID is \\"passive\\" RFID using ISO Standard 18000-6c. The Financial Services Technology Consortium created a standard for tracking assets at bank locations see www.FSTC.org. The company that performed the work for FSTC and most of the member banks is ODIN and they have a specialty RFID Asset Tracking Software. = Flexible pricing options = Management providers typically offer flexible financing options, including pay-per-use, subscription or leasing models.

It lies at the foot of the South Pennines, by Junction 21 of the M62 motorway and on the River Beal, east-southeast of Rochdale, northeast of Manchester. Historically a part of Lancashire, Newhey was anciently a hamlet within the township of Butterworth. It was described in 1828 as \\"consisting of several ranges of cottages and two public houses\\".Butterworth (1828), p. 113. In the early 19th century a major road was built through Newhey from Werneth to Littleborough. Newhey was incorporated into the Milnrow Urban District in 1894. Newhey expanded as part of an unplanned process of urbanisation, brought on by the introduction of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution, and is now home to the Ellenroad Steam Museum - the engine house of the former Ellenroad Ring Mill, the rest of which was demolished in 1985. It holds the world's largest working steam engine. History Ellenroad Ring Mill, as it was in 1984. Lying by the older localities of Milnrow, Ogden and Haugh, Newhey is thought to have acquired its name as a result of land reclamation. Newhey was home to the Newhey Brick and Terracotta Co. Ltd., a prosperous brick and tile works which opened on Huddersfield Road in 1899. Its bricks are found in buildings worldwide. Most mills and associated terraced houses in the Rochdale and Oldham areas were built from this \\"Newhey brick\\". In the 1920s, Newhey had at least five cotton mills, including Ellenroad, Newhey, Coral, Haugh and Garfield (demolished 1969). Governance From a very early time, Newhey was part of the Butterworth township of Rochdale parish, in the Hundred of Salfordshire. From 1894 to 1974, Newhey was part of Milnrow Urban District in the administrative county of Lancashire.Milnrow UD, Vision of Britain. URL accessed 3 January 2007. In the local government reforms of 1974, this urban district status was abolished and Newhey is now part of the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale. Newhey was previously part of the Littleborough and Saddleworth constituency. It is now represented in the House of Commons as part of the parliamentary constituency of Rochdale. Geography The housing estate south of Newhey Road and east of Bentgate Street is known as Bentgate.Looking over Newhey Localities in and around Newhey include Haugh and Woodbottom. Several reservoirs lie above and to the east, including Ogden, Kitcliffe and Piethorne. Landmarks St Thomas's at Newhey Milnrow War Memorial, a Grade II listed structure, is in Newhey's Memorial Park. Originally in central Milnrow (set back from the road near Milnrow Bridge), it was unveiled in 1924 by Major General A Solly-Flood, a former commander of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division. Sculpted from Sandstone by G Thomas in 1923, the memorial is surmounted by a bronze statue of a First World War infantry soldier with rifle and fixed bayonet, symbolic of the district's young manhood in early First World War. The plinth has bronze and slate panels which show the names of local men who died in the two World Wars.Memorial - maintenance - Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council Ellenroad Engine House was designed by Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet.

She described her experiences living in Germany during the Second World War in two books: The Past is Myself (1968) and The Road Ahead. Life Christabel Mary Burton was born in Totteridge, HertfordshireChristabel Bielenberg – IMDb Retrieved 29 October 2016. to Anglo-Irish parents. Her mother, Christabel Harmsworth, was the sister of Lords Northcliffe, Harmsworth, and Rothermere.Obituary in The Independent She was educated at St Margaret's School, Bushey, Hertfordshire, and won a scholarship to Somerville College, Oxford, but decided instead to study music in Germany. While there she met Peter Bielenberg (1911–2001), two years her junior, who was studying law with a view to joining his father's practice in Hamburg. They married in 1934 and she took German citizenship, which required her to relinquish her British citizenship. The Bielenbergs lived initially in Hamburg, then moved to Berlin and had three sons, Nicholas, Christopher, and John. The heavy Allied bombing raids led Mrs Bielenberg and her children to leave the city, and they eventually settled in the village of Rohrbach, near Furtwangen im Schwarzwald, in the Black Forest. Both Christabel and Peter Bielenberg were opposed to Nazism and following Hitler's rise to power in 1933, participated in anti-Nazi activities. Peter Bielenberg was a close friend of Adam von Trott zu Solz, who was involved in the Stauffenberg bomb plot against Hitler of 1944, and as a result of his suspect political views and this close association with Trott, Bielenberg was arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned in Ravensbrück concentration camp following the failure of the plot. In an effort to secure his release, Christabel Bielenberg asked to be interviewed by the Gestapo to convince them of her and her husband's political naivety and innocence. She was interviewed by SS-Sturmbannführer Herbert Lange. She was successful and Bielenberg was released to a punishment unit but mistakenly allowed leave before joining it. He managed to slip away and remained in hiding near his family until the fighting ended. After the war, she returned to Britain with her children, later visiting Germany as a foreign correspondent for The Observer. In 1948, the family settled in Tullow, County Carlow, Ireland, buying a dilapidated farm called \\"Munny House\\", which they transformed into a commercial success. As well as writing her autobiography she became involved with the Irish Peace Marches of the 1970s and lectured in Germany. She was made a Commander of the German Federal Order of Merit and was also awarded a Gold Medal of Merit by the European Parliament. Legacy Her experiences during the Second World War were made into the BBC television drama serial Christabel (1988), adapted from her memoir by Dennis Potter. Elizabeth Hurley starred in the title role. In 1974 Christabel described her experiences of attempting to shelter Jews hiding from persecution in the television series The World at War.

He was a skilled poet and polyglot. He was born in Tortosa around 920 and died around 970. Menahem produced an early dictionary of the Hebrew language. For a time he was the assistant of the great Jewish statesman Hasdai ibn Shaprut, and was involved in both literary and diplomatic matters; his dispute with Dunash ben Labrat, however, led to his downfall. Early career Menahem was a native of Tortosa, and went, apparently at an early age, to Cordoba at the behest of Hasdai ibn Shaprut, minister of trade in the court of the Caliph in Córdoba, where he found a patron in Hasdai's father, Isaac ben Ezra.Menahem ben Saruq, Maḥberet Menaḥem (Manual of Menahem), Jerusalem 1968, supplement: Biography of the Author, the First Hebrew Lexicographer, The Celebrated Rabbi Menahem Ben Saruk (pub. in London 1854, ed. Filipowski, p. 8). At Isaac's death Menahem eulogized his protector's virtues in an inscription placed in the synagogue which had been built by Isaac at Cordoba. He wrote also elegies on him, which were universally recited during the period of mourning. Menahem then returned to his native city, where he engaged in business. Hasdai ibn Shaprut, however, recalled Menahem to Cordoba and encouraged him to complete his life-work, a dictionary of the Hebrew language. In other ways also his new patron availed himself of his protégé's literary talents. On his mother's death, Hasdai requested that Menahem compose a dirge; and when Hasdai addressed his questions to the king of the Khazars, Menahem was commissioned to write the letter, which has become an important historical document. Menahem even included both his patron's and his names in an acrostic including the first letter of each line. Menahem, however, carried on his work amid great privations, as Hasdai did not prove a liberal patron. Dispute with Dunash The dictionary had scarcely been completed when an opponent to its author arose in Dunash ben Labrat, who had come to Spain from Fez, Morocco, and who wrote a criticism on the work, which he prefaced by a eulogistic dedication to Hasdai. Dunash roused Menahem's enemies, who began to complain to Hasdai of Menahem's alleged wrongs against them. The slanders of his personal enemies likewise seem to have aroused Hasdai's anger against Menahem to such a pitch that the latter, at the command of the powerful statesman, suffered bodily violence, being cast out of his house on the Sabbath day, shamed, and imprisoned. In a touching, and at some points audacious letter to Hasdai (a valuable source from which most of this information has been taken) Menahem, who probably died shortly afterward, complained of the wrong done him and sharply criticized Hasdai. He seems to have made some impression on his patron. Menahem is said to have written another work in answer to the criticisms of Dunash, of which only an excerpt has survived, quoted by Rabbi Profiat Duran.Menahem ben Saruq, Maḥberet Menaḥem (Manual of Menahem), Jerusalem 1968, supplement: Biography of the Author, the First Hebrew Lexicographer, The Celebrated Rabbi Menahem Ben Saruk (pub. in London 1854, ed. Filipowski, p. 16). Menahem's pupils also defended their teacher, and in response to Dunash's criticism wrote a detailed refutation which was marked by polemical acumen and exact grammatical knowledge, today preserved in the ducal library of Parma.Menahem ben Saruq, Maḥberet Menaḥem (Manual of Menahem), Jerusalem 1968, supplement: Biography of the Author, the First Hebrew Lexicographer, The Celebrated Rabbi Menahem Ben Saruk (pub. in London 1854, ed. Filipowski, p. 16). Judah ben David Hayyuj, one of these three young scholars who so effectually defended their master, became the founder of scientific Hebrew grammar; another, Isaac ibn Gikatilla, was subsequently, as one of the most learned men of Lucena, the teacher of Jonah ibn Janah. Thus the most flourishing period of Hebrew philology, whose chief representatives were Hayyuj and ibn Janah, began with Menahem's work and teachings. Characteristics of His Dictionary The Mahberet, as Menahem entitled his dictionary, was the first complete lexical treatment of the Biblical vocabulary composed in Hebrew in which the view then prevailing, that there were both uniliteral and biliteral roots, was definitely systematized and worked out. This theory was set aside later by Menahem's own pupil, Hayyuj, who correctly assumed the triliteral character of Hebrew roots; but, because it was written in Hebrew, Menahem's dictionary remained for a long time the chief source of philological instruction for Jews who were unacquainted with Arabic, especially, therefore, for those in the Christian countries of Europe. Thus Rashi in the second half of the eleventh century refers to Menahem as a philological authority; Rashi's grandson, Jacob b. Meïr Tam, composed a work for the special purpose of vindicating Menahem against the attacks of Dunash; and (about 1140) Menahem ben Solomon composed in Italy a dictionary which was based for the most part on the \\"Mahberet.\\" Regarding the grammatical importance of Menahem ben Saruq's work, it may be noted that, although he had no systematic knowledge of the forms of the language, and was unacquainted even with Saadia Gaon's grammatical works, yet he recognized throughout his lexicon that there are inviolable laws underlying the language, and that its forms and phenomena are subject to definite rules. This insight, which appears in the terminology he employs, bridges the apparent chasm between him and his pupil Hayyuj. As Menahem composed his work in Hebrew, he could not use the terminology of the Arabic grammarians; yet he tacitly adopted some of their terms, translating them into Hebrew, and explained some words, although without acknowledging it, on the analogy of kindred Arabic expressions. He avoids, however, any open comparison of the language of the Bible with that of the Quran, notwithstanding the precedent furnished him by Saadia and Judah ibn Kuraish, authors whom he quotes in his dictionary. He doubtless refrained from such comparison because of the religious prejudice which then prevented the Spanish Jews from engaging in such linguistic comparisons. Editions Menahem ben Saruq's dictionary was edited by Filipowski (London, 1854), and addenda from the Bern manuscript of the \\"Mahberet\\" were published by D. Kaufmann in \\"Z. D. M. G.\\" xl. 367-409. The defense by Menahem's pupils was edited by S. G. Stern in \\"Liber Responsionum\\" (Vienna, 1870), where Menahem's letter to Hasdai ibn Shaprut (first edited by Luzzatto in \\"Bet ha-Ozar\\") is reprinted (pp. xxiii-xxxvii).

T. Sherman leading his army at the Grand Review, Washington D.C., May 24, 1865 The \\"bummers\\" and foragers of Sherman's Army in the Grand Review, Washington D.C., May 24, 1865 Bummers was a nickname applied to foragers of Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman's Union army during its March to the Sea and north through South Carolina and North Carolina during the American Civil War. History =Origin= The designation \\"bummers\\" was used, both by soldiers and civilians, to describe Sherman's soldiers, official and unofficial, who \\"requisitioned\\" food from Southern homes along the route of the Army's march. Often highly destructive in nature, bummers became notorious among Southerners for looting and vandalism, and they did much to shatter the illusion that the Confederate Army was successfully defending its territory on all fronts. The bummers' activities in Georgia and the Carolinas helped ensure that the South would be unable to sustain its war effort; additionally, bummers' destruction of industrial property rendered the garrisoning of southern cities largely unnecessary by destroying most, if not all, of those facilities in their path that replenished the Confederate war effort (such as cotton gins, farms, foundries, lumber mills, etc.). One southern family's encounter with bummers was recorded by North Carolina resident and Civil War diarist Jane Evans Elliot: Sherman admitted himself after the war that \\"many acts of pillage, robbery, and violence were committed\\" by the bummers.Lincoln's Code: The Laws of War in American History, by John Fabian Witt =Interpretation= Sherman’s veterans appropriated the belittling title bummer as a point of personal pride. On May 24, 1865, Sherman’s Army paraded for six hours through the Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D,C., during the Grand Review of the Union Armies on May 23-24, 1865. Union General Horace Porter called foraging during the Sherman's raid a \\"novel feature of Sherman's command . . . organized for a very useful purpose from the adventurous spirits which are always found in the ranks.\\"Through the Heart of Dixie: Sherman's March and American Memory, by Anne S. Rubin. Another Union General Henry Warner Slocum characterized the Sherman's March as \\"one great picnic from beginning to end” with \\"just enough fighting and danger of fighting to give zest to the experience.\\"Anne S. Rubin. ‘Forage Liberally on the Country’: Sherman’s Troops Forage in the March to the Sea, Civil War Times, February 2015 Union General Edward Follansbee Noyes said that in \\"this rollicking picnic expedition there was just enough of fighting for variety, enough of hardship to give zest to the repose which followed it, and enough of ludicrous adventure to make its memory a constant source of gratification.\\"Report of the Proceedings of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee, Volumes 1-5.

Simpson, schizophrenia, Charles Manson, the attack on Reginald Denny during the Rodney King riots, strychnine poisoning, flagellation in Singapore, Jeffrey Dahmer, Kurt Cobain's suicide and psilocybin mushrooms. Album and music video The album song portrays a couple (performed by Priest ‘Soopafly’ Brooks and Nanci Fletcher) walking down the street in a bad neighborhood, until, from a distance, they are yelled at and verbally insulted by a local thug. Though the intro is different in the video and audio versions, both of them involve murder and end with the sound of a gunshot.

Also appearing in the video as police detectives are John Amos and Art Evans. Although the song and video were highly popular, and debuted a short time after release of the Oliver Stone film Natural Born Killers, the song did not appear in the film or on its soundtrack. It did, however, appear in the 2011 film Bridesmaids starring Kristen Wiig. Cover versions In 1996, the song was covered by Christ Analogue for the electro-industrial various artists compilation Operation Beatbox.

It tells the story of Benjamin Braddock, who, while pondering his future after his graduation, has an affair with the older Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner, before falling in love with her daughter Elaine. It was adapted into the highly successful 1967 film The Graduate, directed by Mike Nichols and with Dustin Hoffman in the title role. Webb has stated he never felt comfortable with the attention the film brought him because he felt it distracted from his status as a serious artist. He did not receive any royalties from the film and has stated he is glad it happened that way.\\"Graduate author to write sequel\\", CNN.com On the episode of the AMC television series Movies That Shook the World devoted to the film adaptation, Webb revealed the identity of the real-life inspiration for Mrs. Robinson: Jane Ericson (exact spelling unknown), the wife of an associate of Webb's father. However, that was the extent of any similarity with the novel; Webb denied having a relationship with her. A sequel titled Home School, which takes place ten years after the ending of the first novel, was published by Hutchinson in June 2007. The book's creation serves as the centerpiece of the 2005 film Rumor Has It.... Plot =Part 1= Benjamin Braddock has recently graduated from a small Eastern college and has returned home to a suburb of Los Angeles. Suffering a small identity crisis, Benjamin, visibly uncomfortable as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans, evades those who try to congratulate him. He insists that he wants to be alone and to go on a walk, but eventually gives up and returns to his room. Mrs. Robinson enters his room, claiming to be looking for the bathroom, but stays with Benjamin, asking him strange questions and probing into his life. At the insistence of the neglected wife of his father's law partner, he drives Mrs. Robinson home. Once at the house, Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. Benjamin rebuffs her and quickly goes downstairs as he hears Mr. Robinson arriving home. During the next week, a day after his 21st birthday, Benjamin announces his intention to go on a road trip in order to cast off the societal expectations to spend his life “amongst the common people.” =Part 2= After the trip he decides to begin his affair with Mrs. Robinson and meets her at the Taft Hotel. In mid- September, Benjamin spends the time drifting around in the pool by day, purposefully neglecting to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. One evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she is in a loveless marriage, because in the 1940s, she became pregnant with her daughter, Elaine, dropped out of college, and married to avoid scandal. After being increasingly pressured by his parents and Mr. Robinson to go on a date with Elaine, he takes her out but deliberately sabotages the date by driving recklessly and taking her to two clubs and a strip show. Elaine suggests going to the Taft Hotel, and Benjamin becomes visibly uncomfortable. The hotel staff recognizes him, causing Elaine to be suspicious. He tells Elaine that he had an affair with an older married woman with a husband and a son. Benjamin discovers that Elaine is someone he is comfortable with, and agrees to ask Elaine out again the next day. The next morning, Mrs. Robinson threatens to expose their relationship to Elaine if Benjamin ever sees Elaine again. Benjamin decides to tell Elaine everything. Elaine is furious and wants nothing to do with him and returns to Berkeley. After many months pass, Benjamin decides to marry Elaine. =Part 3= Benjamin goes to Berkeley and moves into a rooming house near Elaine's dormitory. Elaine is uneasy in his presence and tells him that she has started dating Carl Smith, a medical student. Elaine accuses him of taking advantage of her mother's drunken state and raping her, refusing to believe that it was her mother who initiated the affair. Elaine eventually realizes that her mother was lying, and makes him promise to not leave Berkeley until he has definite plans. When Benjamin proposes marriage, Elaine says she is concerned about graduating from college and her relationship with her parents if she continues to see him. Benjamin receives a telegram from Mrs. Robinson, telling him to get out of town immediately. Mr. Robinson arrives at the college and tells Benjamin that he is divorcing his wife and terminating his partnership with Mr. Braddock. Then he warns him not to get close to Elaine again, otherwise he will prosecute him. He forces his daughter to drop out of school and takes her away. Benjamin's father arrives the following day and wants to take him back home to see a psychiatrist. Benjamin returns to his hometown and sneaks into the Robinsons' home but encounters both Mr. and Mrs. Robinson, who call the police and claim that a man has broken into their house. He escapes from the house and returns to Berkeley to find Elaine. Benjamin lands in San Francisco. He finds Carl's apartment address in the directory and heads over. There he finds a letter and learns that Carl will marry Elaine that very morning. Benjamin takes a plane to Santa Barbara and finds the church, where the ceremony is already taking place. He tries the doors to the church, all of which are locked, except for a side door that leads to the balcony. As he sees Elaine walking down the aisle, he interrupts the ceremony, slamming his hands on the railing and calling her name. He runs downstairs to the sanctuary, punches Mr. Robinson, and fights Carl off using a cross as a weapon. Together, Benjamin and Elaine flee the church and ride off on the nearest bus to elope. Stage adaptation John Reid produced a play in 2000, adapted from the original novel and the movie, which was a hit both in London's West End and on Broadway and has toured the United States. There is a Brazilian version adapted by Miguel Falabella. Several actresses have starred as Mrs. Robinson, including Kathleen Turner, Lorraine Bracco, Jerry Hall, Amanda Donohoe, Morgan Fairchild, Anne Archer, Vera Fischer and Linda Gray. The Broadway production in 2002 starred Kathleen Turner, Jason Biggs, and Alicia Silverstone. The stage production adds several scenes that are not in the novel or the film. It also uses songs by Simon & Garfunkel not used in the film, such as \\"Baby Driver\\" as well as music from other popular musicians from the era such as The Byrds and The Beach Boys. Sequel In Home School, Ben and Elaine, now married and living in Westchester County, are fighting to allow for their child to be homeschooled. They turn to Mrs. Robinson to help them. The novel is set in the 1970s. In real life, Webb himself had fought to have his boys homeschooled.

The 'scarlet woman', a pleasant woman named Stella, tries but fails to win Claudia's approval. However, after a dinner party with her father's friends who also ignore Stella, Claudia realises her mistake and attempts to get them into attention by wearing beautiful green pyjamas bought by Stella in front of the guests, shocking them into politeness. Colin reveals that his 'Dad' (who was his mother's partner but not his biological father) was left behind by his mother after they had absconded one day.

Of these students are required to choose one, although a combination of two is possible, in addition to a mandatory core curriculum and self-assembled general education, the latter picked from courses in a different concentration than the individual student's chosen concentration. =Concentrations= The Humanities concentration includes the academic disciplines of arts and media studies, cultural studies, European studies, history, literature, philosophy and science and technology studies. The Sciences concentration, previously known as Life Sciences, includes biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics and sustainable development. Finally, the Social Sciences concentration includes business administration, economics, international law, international relations, political science, psychology, public administration and sociology. Courses are additionally structured in a 1000 to 3000-level grid, indicating an increasing level of complexity and necessary previous knowledge. In addition to courses, students are required to choose skills trainings including, but not limited to, argumentation, ethnography, languages and research methods. Thirdly, students are required to take one project, e.g. academic debating, per semester. =Curriculum structure= An individual student's curriculum consists of the previously mentioned courses, skills trainings and projects. With UCM using the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) a BA or BSc at UCM will comprise a total of 180 ECTS. Students subsequently enrol in a maximum of 30 ECTS per semester, or 60 ECTS for a full year, with students receiving 5 ECTS for courses and projects and 2.5 ECTS for skills trainings. Students create their own curriculum, with help of academic advisors, by choosing courses located within their respective concentration in addition to a requirement to complete a core curriculum, consisting of four courses, and a general education requirement, consisting of two courses per concentration the student did not choose. The aim of this curriculum is to provide students with the opportunity to develop their own academic preferences and talents and acquire the expertise and skills to enter a Master programmes (see Admissions and Student Population). =International partnerships= Since its inception the college has established a number of international partnerships, allowing its students to participate in exchange programmes with subsequent study points counting towards their UCM degrees. Partner universities include University of California, Berkeley, Seoul National University, University College London and Sciences Po Lille. Location and building After major renovations, UCM moved into the former Nieuwenhof convent in 2006. Located in the Jekerkwartier neighbourhood in central Maastricht, the building dates back to 1485 immediately adjacent to Maastricht's city fortifications. The 2000s (decade) renovation of the former convent included the creation of a common room, IT facilities and a reading room providing specific literature related to courses taught at the college. UCM's Jekerkwartier location makes it part of the larger city centre campus of Maastricht University including its inner city library, School of Business, Law faculty and Graduate School of Governance.

It included 1st Guards Army, 8th Guards Army, 6th, 12th, and 46th Armies and 17th Air Army. Later it included 5th Shock, 4th and 9th Guards Army, 26th, 27th, 28th, 37th, 57th Army, 6th Guards Tank Army, and the Bulgarian First, Second and Fourth Armies. The Danube Flotilla was assigned to the Front's operational control. This included the 83rd Naval Infantry Brigade. Zaporizhia and Dnipropetrovsk offensive operations In the first half of October 1943, Southwestern Front (3rd Ukrainian Front from 20 October) commanded by Army General Rodion Malinovsky was tasked with attacking the German Panther-Wotan line, and later securing the bridgeheads on the eastern bank of the Dnieper on the Izyum - Dnipropetrovsk axis during the Battle of the Lower Dnieper. But the first attempt to establish bridgeheads failed. Three infantry armies: 8th Guards, 3rd Guards and the 12th Army, and two corps, 1st Guards Mechanized and 23rd Tank with 17th Air Army providing air support were assembled for the new assault. On 10 October 1943 Chuikov's 8th Guards launched the attack, with the tank corps being inserted on the 13 October; the 12th Army attacked from the north, and 3rd Guards from the south of Zaporizhia. Germans retreated from Zaporizhia, destroying the railway bridge over Dnieper behind themselves.Erickson, John, The Road To Berlin, Cassell Military Paperbacks, 2003 p.138 On 23 October Malinovsky, who wanted to take Dnipropetrovsk, and trap the First Panzer Army in the eastern reaches of the Dnieper bend, inserted the newly arrived 46th Army into combat. Together with 8th Guards it was trying to trap German forces against the western bank of Dnieper between Dnipropetrovsk and Dniprodzerzhynsk, the site of the huge Dnieper Hydroelectric Station. The 46th Army units tried to get to the station in time to prevent the destruction of the dam by retreating German troops. On 25 October Dnipropetrovsk was taken, but the installations and the Dam were partly destroyed.Erickson, p.139 At the same time the Koniev's 2nd Ukrainian Front was attacking towards the Kryvyi Rih from the north with the 7th Guards Army, but the 1st Panzer Army was saved for the moment as Koniev's assault on Kryvyi Rih stalled at Ingulets river north of Kherson.Atlas Mira Moskva 1988 Ukrainska SSr Moldavskaja SSR page 46 However, Vatutin commanding the 1st Ukrainian Front located north of Poltava sent the 5th Guards Tank Army which penetrated north of Kryvyi Rih, and was only halted by the stubborn German defence and length of its own logistic tail. On conclusion, both operations allowed the two Fronts to create a single Krementchug- Dnipropetrovsk bridgehead expanded to Zaporizhia due to the breaching of the Wotan Line by the Southern Front. Later, units of the 6th Army seized bridgeheads south of Zaporizhia, and by the end of December, along with 2nd Ukrainian Front held on the Dnieper major strategic stronghold. After the liberation of right-bank Ukraine by troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front, in collaboration with 4th Ukrainian Front by making Nikopol-Krivoy Rog Operation 1944, the took to the district Ingulets, where in March–April launched an offensive at the Nikolayev-Odessa area. After carrying out the Bereznegovatoye–Snigirevka Offensive operation, the front readied itself for an attack on Odessa. Before the Odessa Offensive 3rd Ukrainian received substantial reinforcements. It now fielded seven Armies: 5th Shock Army, 6th Army, 8th Guards Army, 28th Army, 37th Army, 46th Army and 57th Army. Malinowsky also formed a cavalry-mechanized group consisting of 4th Guards Cavalry Corps and 4th Mechanized Corps under Lt. Gen. Pliev. The target was port Nikolayev and large Black Sea port Odessa. The attack opened on 6 March 1944 when Soviet troops forced the Ingulets, the Visun and the Ingul rivers. They assisted the Black Sea Fleet completing the liberation of southern Ukraine, and liberated a large part of the Moldavian SSR and moved to Dniester and, seizing bridgeheads on its right bank, including Kitskansky bridgehead. The troops of the 3rd Ukrainian Front to come to Bucharest 31 August 1944 Romania and Bulgaria In August 1944 the 3rd Ukrainian Front engaged in the Iassy-Kishinev Offensive, which resulted in the release of all the Moldavian SSR, and Romania declaring war on Germany. On 8 September, after breaking diplomatic ties and declaring war to Bulgaria, Soviet troops entered the territory of Bulgaria and by the end of the month occupied the country. From 28 September - 20 October 1944 3rd Ukrainian Front in collaboration with the People's Liberation Army of Yugoslavia with the participation of troops of the Fatherland Front in Bulgaria carried out the Belgrade Offensive, which resulted in the liberation of the capital of Yugoslavia, Belgrade, and most of Serbia. In October 1944 - February 1945, the 3rd Ukrainian Front had forces involved in the Siege of Budapest, including 46th Army. Its troops crossed the Danube and seized a bridgehead on its right bank. In January 1945, they repelled the enemy counter-attacks, trying to relieve the forces surrounded in Budapest, and in March, during the German Operation Frühlingserwachen, a counter-offensive broke the German troops in the area of Lake Balaton. The successful completion of this battle made possible the beginning of the Vienna Offensive on 16 March, in conjunction with the left wing 2nd Ukrainian Front. Thereafter the front's forces completed the liberation of Hungary, expelled the enemy from the eastern part of Austria and took its capital, Vienna. The Front included 57th Army from October to December 1944. On 15 June 1945, the on the basis of a Stavka directive on May 29, 1945, the front was disbanded, and reorganised as the Southern Group of Forces. 26th Army was grouped with 37th Army into the SGF. 3rd Ukrainian Front in October 1943 during Zaporizhia–Dnipropetrovsk operation Front Commander: General of Army Rodion Malinovsky 1st Guards Army :6th Guards Rifle Corps ::20th Guards Rifle Division ::152nd Rifle Division :34th Rifle Corps ::6th Rifle Division ::24th Rifle Division ::228th Rifle Division ::195th Rifle Division 3rd Guards Army: :34th Guards Rifle Corps ::59th Guards Rifle Division ::61st Guards Rifle Division ::279th Rifle Division (Unit listed twice) :32nd Rifle Corps ::259th Rifle Division ::266th Rifle Division ::279th Rifle Division (Unit listed twice) 8th Guards Army: :28th Guards Rifle Corps ::39th Guards Rifle Division ::79th Guards Rifle Division ::88th Guards Rifle Division :29th Guards Rifle Corps ::27th Guards Rifle Division ::74th Guards Rifle Division ::82nd Guards Rifle Division :33rd Rifle Corps ::50th Rifle Division ::78th Rifle Division 6th Army: :4th Guards Rifle Corps ::47th Guards Rifle Division ::57th Guards Rifle Division :26th Guards Rifle Corps ::25th Guards Rifle Division ::35th Guards Rifle Division 12th Army :66th Rifle Corps ::203rd Rifle Division ::333rd Rifle Division ::60th Guards Rifle Division ::244th Rifle Division 1st Guards Mechanized Corps :1st Guards Mechanized Brigade :2nd Guards Mechanized Brigade :3rd Guards Mechanized Brigade :9th Guards Tank Brigade 23rd Tank Corps :3rd Tank Brigade :39th Tank Brigade :135th Tank Brigade :56th Motorized Rifle Brigade 17th Air Army :1st Guards Mixed Aviation Corps :1st Mixed Aviation Corps :9th Mixed Aviation CorpsBoevoi Sostav Sovietskoi Armii czast III januar-dekabr 1943 page 253 in the BSSA Front is listed under South Western Front name but it changed name in October to 3rd Ukrainian Front from November 1943 it is listed under name of 3rd Ukrainian Front  Command  Commanders: * General of the Army Rodion Malinovsky (Oct. 1943 – May 1944); * General of the Army, in September 1944, Marshal of the Soviet Union Fyodor Tolbukhin (May 1944 – end of the war).

It required the government to assess whether individuals were \\"competent and capable\\" before giving them fee simple patents to their allotted land. Because the federal government believed that many Indians were not prepared for United States citizenship, the act further provided that citizenship not be granted to Native American individuals until at the time of the final validation of their trust patents instead of upon the receipt of the trust patents, as stated in the Dawes Act. Those who were issued fee simple patents were granted citizenship upon receipt. Those whose land remained in trust status were to be granted citizenship at the conclusion of the twenty-five year trust period. It was named for U. S. Congressman Charles H. Burke. Background =Competence= The Burke Act amended the GAA to provide for the Secretary of the Interior to assess individual Native Americans as ‘competent and capable.’ before issuing any person receiving a land allotment a patent in fee simple. Receiving a fee simple patent meant that the land of the allotee would be removed from federal trust status and made subject to taxation. The allotee would be able to sell it on the private market. The act reads: :“..the Secretary of the Interior may, in his discretion, and he is hereby authorized, whenever he shall be satisfied that any Indian allottee is competent and capable of managing his or her affairs at any time to cause to be issued to such allottee a patent in fee simple, and thereafter all restrictions as to sale, incumbrance [sic], or taxation of said land shall be removed.” Studies have shown that Bureau of Indian Affairs officials tended first to classify people as 'competent and capable' if they were of mixed-race (with some European ancestry). These allottees were deemed ‘competent’ because BIA officials believed that their European ancestry made them mentally superior, that they were more likely to be assimilated culturally, and therefore they were able to take responsibility of their land. Allowing officials to assess competence made administration of the act more subjective, increasing the exclusionary power of the Secretary of Interior and inviting corruption among those with an opportunity to profit by gaining Indian-owned land. Although the act gave power to the allotee to decide whether to keep or sell the land, provided the harsh economic reality of the time, and lack of access by many Native Americans on reservations to credit and markets, liquidation of Indian- owned lands was almost inevitable. The Department of Interior officials associated with this program expected that virtually 95% of fee patented land would eventually be sold to whites.Paul Robertson, The Power of the Land, Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2002 The following passage from the 1913 annual report from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation reveals that the supervisor of the reservation expected eventual dispossession of land after individual Lakota people had been issued fee patent. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) reservation superintendent characterized this result as a ‘valuable lesson.’ :“It is still the conviction of this office that the issue of a patent in fee for a portion of an Indian’s land who is judged as being competent or near-competent, is the proper procedure in dealing with the land question among the Indians… Even if the proceeds derived from the dispossession of the land are squandered he still has plenty of land left and he may have learned a few lessons that will prove of value in the future.” (Department of the Interior, Annual Report of the Pine Ridge Agency, SD, August 1, 1913) The Burke Act had other consequences. In some cases, individual Indians deemed \\"competent\\" were not notified of the status and were not informed that their land's status had shifted from trust land to fee patent. As a result, individual owners did not realize the land was subject to taxation. After a period of taxes being unpaid, local or state jurisdictions could sell the land without the owner's consent to pay past taxes. This process was known as the \\"forced fee patent process.\\" In this way, the Burke Act contributed to the ongoing fractionation of lands within reservation boundaries and overall loss of Tribal or Indian-owned lands.

He is regarded as the father of scientific grammar of the Hebrew language. He was born in Fez, Morocco, about 945. At an early age he went to Cordoba, where he seems to have remained till his death, which occurred about 1000 CE. Career Hayyuj was a pupil of Menahem ben Saruq, whom he later helped to defend against the attacks of Dunash ben Labrat and his followers. Later in life Hayyuj developed his own theories about Hebrew grammar, and was himself obliged to step forward as an opponent of the grammatical theories of his teacher. His thorough knowledge of Arabic grammatical literature led him to apply to the Hebrew grammar the theories elaborated by Arabic grammarians, and thus to become the founder of the scientific study of that discipline. The preceding scholars had found the greatest difficulty in accounting, by the laws of Hebrew morphology, for the divergences existing between the regular, or so-called \\"strong,\\" verbs and the \\"weak\\" verbs. A hopeless confusion appeared to reign here in Hebrew; and much ingenuity was spent in endeavoring to discover the principles that controlled the conjugation of the verbs. The weakness of Menahem's assertion that there are stems in Hebrew containing three letters, two letters, and one letter respectively was pointed out by Dunash; but, although the latter was on the road to a solution of the problem, it was left to Ḥayyuj to find the key. His works Hayyuj announced that all Hebrew stems consist of three letters, and maintained that when one of those letters was a \\"vowel letter,\\" such a letter could be regarded as \\"concealed\\" in diverse ways in the various verbal forms. To substantiate his theory he wrote the treatise upon which his reputation chiefly rests, the Kitab al-Af'al Dhawat Huruf al-Lin (The Book of Verbs Containing Weak Letters). The treatise is in three parts: the first is devoted to verbs whose first radical is a weak letter; the second to verbs whose second radical is weak; and the third to verbs whose third radical is weak. Within each division he furnishes what he considers a complete list of the verbs belonging to the class in question, enumerates various forms of the verb, and, when necessary, adds brief comments and explanations. Preceding each division the principles underlying the formation of the stems belonging to the division are systematically set forth in a series of introductory chapters. As a supplement to this treatise he wrote a second, which he called the Kitab al-Af'al Dhawat al-Mathalain (The Book of Verbs Containing Double Letters), and in which he points out the principles governing the verbs whose second and third radicals are alike. He furnishes a list of these verbs, together with their various forms occurring in the Bible. Besides the two treatises on verbs Hayyuj wrote Kitab al-Tanqit (The Book of Punctuation). This work, probably written before his two chief treatises, is an attempt to set forth the features underlying the Masoretic use of the vowels and of the word-tone. In this work he deals chiefly with nouns, and its purpose is more of a practical than of a theoretical character. A fourth work, the Kitab al- Natf (The Book of Extracts), is known to have been written by Hayyuj, but only a fragment, unpublished as of the beginning of the 20th century, and a few quotations by later authors have survived. This was a supplement to his two grammatical works on the verb, and in it he noted the verbs omitted by him in the former treatises. In doing this he anticipated in a measure ibn Janah's Mustalhaq which was devoted to this very purpose. He arranged and discussed the verbal stems in question, not alphabetically, but in the order in which they occur in the Bible. Influence Hayyuj exerted an immense influence on succeeding generations. All later Hebrew grammarians up to the present day base their works on his; and the technical terms still employed in current Hebrew grammars are most of them simply translations of the Arabic terms employed by Hayyuj. His first three works were twice translated into Hebrew, first by Moses ibn Gikatilla and later by Abraham ibn Ezra.

It is affiliated with the Minnesota State High School League. History The Lake Conference was originally formed in 1932 with the charter members being Hopkins High School, Minnetonka High School, Mound High School, Saint Louis Park High School, University High School, and Wayzata High School. The name originates from the fact that most of these schools were located in cities where lakes were abundant and that Minnesota is the Land of 10,000 Lakes. All of these schools have since departed, with a majority of them going to the Classic Lake Conference Until 1993, Lake was split into two divisions, Lake Red and Lake Blue, most of the departed schools had been in Lake Blue. These included Robbinsdale Armstrong, Minnetonka, Edina, St. Louis Park, Hopkins, Wayzata, and Robbinsdale Cooper. Richfield also departed to the Classic Lake, but was soon to leave due to a fast declining enrollment and changing demographics. The departure of the Classic Lake Schools changed the face of the conference forever. All departed schools have sought to rejoin their old conference. The classic line up of the 1970s was: Wayzata High School, Robbinsdale Armstrong High School, Robbinsdale Cooper High School, Robbinsdale High School (closed 1982), Minnetonka High School, Hopkins Lindbergh High School (now Hopkins High School), Hopkins Eisenhower High School (now Eisenhower Community Center), St. Louis Park High School, Edina East High School (now Edina Community Center), Edina West High School (now Edina High School), Richfield High School, Bloomington Lincoln High School (closed in 1982), Bloomington Jefferson High School, and Bloomington Kennedy High School. In 1957, Bloomington High School entered. This district later divided into Bloomington Lincoln and Kennedy in 1965 and Jefferson High School who joined in 1970. Burnsville entered in 1976. Apple Valley, Rosemount and Eden Prairie joined in 1986. Eagan came in 1990; Lakeville in 1993; Chaska in 1994; Eastview High School in 1997 and Lakeville South in 2005. The school previously known as Lakeville now has the name Lakeville North. Chanhassen opened and became a member in the fall of 2009. In the 2010-2011 academic year, Apple Valley, Bloomington Jefferson, Bloomington Kennedy, Burnsville, Eagan, Eastview, Lakeville North, Lakeville South, and Rosemount formed a new conference called the South Suburban Conference. Prior Lake High School left the Missota Conference to form the South Suburban with the several former Lake teams. Also, Chaska and Chanhassen will join the Missota conference in 2010. Eden Prairie stayed in the Lake Conference while Edina, Hopkins, Minnetonka, and Wayzata joined the Lake, disbanding the Classic Lake Conference. In 2018, it was announced St. Michael-Albertville High School and Buffalo High School will be joining the Lake Conference, bringing it to a total of seven schools. The mission of the Lake Conference is to promote and recognize excellence by providing quality experiences for students in programs of academics, arts, athletics and activities. The Lake Conference conducts its activities under the auspices and in concert of the Minnesota State High School League. Currently member schools compete in 27 interscholastic sports and 14 fine arts activities: Fall * Cross Country - Boys * Cross Country - Girls * Football * Soccer - Boys * Soccer - Girls * Swimming & Diving - Girls * Tennis - Girls Winter * Volleyball - Girls * Alpine Ski * Basketball - Boys * Basketball - Girls * Dance Team * Gymnastics * Hockey - Boys * Hockey - Girls * Nordic Ski * Swimming & Diving - Boys * Wrestling Spring * Baseball * Golf - Boys * Golf - Girls * Lacrosse - Boys * Lacrosse - Girls * Softball - Girls * Synchronized Swim * Tennis - Boys * Track & Field - Boys * Track & Field - Girls References External links *Official Website *https://web.archive.org/web/20100613070615/http://district196.org/District/Departments/Communications/SpotlightNewsletter/2009-10/spotlightWinter2009.pdf Category:Minnesota high school sports conferences ","title":"Lake Conference"},{"id":"4845197","text":"Booterstown () is a coastal suburb of the city of Dublin in Ireland.

The film was a Franco-Italian-American co-production made by Pathé, SGC and Titanus. It was directed by Robert Aldrich and produced by Maurizio Lodi-Fe, Goffredo Lombardo and Joseph E. Levine. The screenplay was by Giorgio Prosperi and Hugo Butler, and the music score was composed by Miklós Rózsa. Plot The twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah prosper because of their great deposits of salt, which are mined by an army of slaves. The decadent citizens, who have become wealthy by trading salt, live in luxury and use slaves as servants and for violent games of entertainment. After a night of revelry, Astaroth (Stanley Baker), the Prince of Sodom, tells slave girl Tamar (Scilla Gabel) to carry a message to the king of the Elamites, with whom he plans to overthrow his sister, Bera, Queen of Sodom (Anouk Aimée). Returning from her meeting in the desert with the Elamite leader, Tamar is captured by a Sodomite patrol. Queen Bera demands the name of her co-conspirator. Tamar refuses to speak under interrogation and Bera has her and her two young sisters killed. Meanwhile, Lot (Stewart Granger) leads his family and a Hebrew tribe through the desert, hoping that he can find a permanent home for his people along the fertile banks of the River Jordan. By contrast with the people of the twin cities, the Hebrews are presented as a pious and austere people with high moral standards. As the Hebrews approach their destination, Lot meets the beautiful Ildith (Pier Angeli), who luxuriates in a litter while a group of slave girls in chains precede her over the rocky terrain. Lot assumes that Ildith owns these women. She tells him that she is also a slave, albeit the chief of the Queen of Sodom's body slaves. Lot tells her that owning slaves is evil. The following dialog ensues: > Ildith: \\"Evil? How strange you are. Where I come from, nothing is evil. > Everything that gives pleasure is good.\\" > Lot: \\"Where do you come from?\\" > Ildith: \\"There, not far. Just ahead: Sodom and Gomorrah.\\" Once Lot and his people reach the Jordan, he negotiates the use of the land on one side of the river with Queen Bera, promising her both grain and defense should Sodom's desert enemies attack. In a surprising turn, she gives Lot Ildith, who does not wish to leave the queen or her life of luxury in Sodom. Astorath is disgusted and baffled by his sister's easy terms with the Hebrews. However, he soon turns his attentions to Lot's flirtatious daughter, Shuah (Rossana Podestà). Ildith dislikes the rough conditions of the Hebrew camp, but soon befriends Lot's daughters. She and Lot also fall in love and plan to marry. Meanwhile, Shuah and Astaroth begin a secret affair. Lot's other daughter, Maleb (Claudia Mori) and his headstrong lieutenant, Ishmael (Rik Battaglia) also plan a marriage. Lot and Ildith's wedding day celebrations are interrupted by an Elamite attack. Although the Hebrew farmers and the Sodomite soldiers fight valiantly, they are nearly defeated by the fierce nomadic warriors. In a last, desperate measure, Lot orders that the dam that the Hebrews have built be broken. His quick thinking saves the twin cities and the Hebrews, but the camp and the crops are destroyed. However, the flood waters reveal that the Hebrew camp is also the site of a vast salt deposit. Lot now believes that the Hebrews can move out of the wilderness and live among the Sodomites (\\"Separate, but in their full view\\", he cautions) by selling salt. (In the original Roadshow prints, this is where the theatrical intermission occurred.) Some time later, Lot and Ildith now live in luxury in Sodom. Sodomites and Hebrews both revere Lot and seek his judgment. Ishmael however, believes that Lot has succumbed to luxury and instead should liberate Sodom's mine slaves. Lot disagrees and advises Ishmael to wait, believing that the Sodomites will change their ways in time. Ishmael does not heed Lot and unsuccessfully tries to set the slaves free, believing that the Hebrews will harbour them. Instead the Hebrews shut their doors on the desperate escapees who are soon recaptured and sentenced to death. As the newly appointed minister of justice, Lot must now sentence Ishmael. However Ishmael is only one of Lot's problems, as he is confronted by the jealous Astaroth, who tells him that not only has he slept with both of Lot's daughters, but that Ildith had known and kept the affairs secret. An outraged Lot kills Astaroth. At this point, Queen Bera's plot becomes clear: she used the Hebrews to destroy the Elamite threat and also used Lot to rid her of her scheming brother. Lot becomes deeply remorseful that he has not only killed but he led his family and people into sin. Bera has him taken to prison. While Lot asks God for forgiveness and guidance, two angels appear to tell him that God is displeased with the twin cities and will destroy them. Lot pleads with the angels to spare the city if he can find just ten Sodomite citizens who will repent and leave the cities with him. The angels agree and free both Lot and Ishmael from prison after warning Lot that anyone leaving Sodom who looks back will be struck down as well. Meanwhile, many recaptured slaves are tortured to death on the wheel. Queen Bera exclaims \\"But wait, the games have just begun\\", as Lot appears seeking ten righteous Sodomites. Although he has God's consent, Lot finds it impossible to persuade any Sodomite citizens to follow him, only the slaves are willing to accompany him. Even his own daughters, who believe Lot a hypocrite, at first refuse. Ildith, however, convinces them to leave, hoping that they will someday understand their father and his greatness as a leader. Shuah goes only grudgingly, telling Lot that she hopes to see him suffering, as she does now that Astaroth is dead. Immediately after the Hebrews and Sodomite slaves leave, God assails Sodom with earthquakes and lightning. Queen Bera retreats with her slave Orphea to her palace, where they are killed under the collapsing pillars. The Sodomites flee into the streets, still committing vile and selfish acts to save themselves or exploit the chaos, and are killed by collapsing buildings and fire. Meanwhile, Ildith now wishes she were back in Sodom. Despite her love for Lot, she cannot accept his God, choosing to believe in Lot rather than in a Divine plan. Despite Lot's warnings, Ildith looks back at Sodom. God turns her into a pillar of salt just as He destroys the city with a final fiery explosion. Lot collapses in grief. Maleb and Shuah rush to comfort him. He staggers off with the Hebrews, who wander the desert once more.

Levine was enticed into a co production with the Italian company Titanus. Levine: > All I saw was a bad script. They wanted a million dollars. I said 'let's get > a good script and spend two million.

Location shooting took place near Marrakesh and the budget grew from $2 million to $5 million.Brian Trenchard Smith on Last Days of Sodom and Gomorrah at Trailers from Hell Score  The film is notable for featuring the last of Miklós Rózsa's epic film scores. Rozsa, who replaced Dimitri Tiomkin, thought the film was tacky and inferior. In January, 2007, Digitmovies AE released a nearly complete version of the score on a two-CD set, which is taken from the Legend LP recording. Previously, other selections from the score were available on two CDs: one from Cambria Records and Publishing, which is taken from the composer's mono recordings and one from BMG, which is taken from the original LP.

It is located between Carlisle and Penrith. The house is now little more than a ruin with just the mere exterior walls and certain foundations surviving. It is currently not open to the public. It is privately owned, and the owners have now for some time been trying to restore it to its former glory. History The site was originally occupied by the Kings Castle in the Forest of Inglewood. The earliest written record is of the original castle is from 1272. This castle was a medieval square pele tower within a curtain wall. The first known occupants of the house were the Richmond family, who bought and extended the house in the 16th century. Only its western wing remains, with its unmistakable straight-headed mullioned windows with round-arched lights under hood moulds, although attached to the south-west corner of this wing is the basement of a square tower which presents evidence of 14th-century work. The house was later sold to the Baron Brougham and Vaux who made some alterations. One member of the family, Henry Richmond Brougham, had a new facade built in 1744–1748. It is eleven bays long, with a pedimented three-bay centre, and a walled front garden with coupled Ionic columns. When the Broughams no longer required the house, they rented it out for some time. By the mid-19th century, and until at least 1909, it was occupied by the Hills family, and was the childhood home of the soldier and astronomer Edmond Hills. The only other people known to have rented it were the Cavaghan family (co- founders of Cavaghan & Gray), who lived in the house for around eight years, from 1921 to 1929. The castle was largely destroyed by fire in 1956, and is now little more than a shell. Both the medieval wing and the principal house are Grade 2 listed. Adjacent is a fine stable quadrangle with heavy rustication, a steep pediment gable and cupola.

Although it is possible that he died in the conflict, no source states as much, and it is uncertain when he died.

He seems to have vacated the throne by the 970s. His apparent son, Rhydderch, may have briefly reigned as king, although no source states as much.Thornton (2001) p. 67 n. 66. Certainly, English sources reveal that Dyfnwal's son, Máel Coluim, ruled in 973 whilst Dyfnwal was still alive.Macquarrie (2004); Thornton (2001) pp. 66–67. Following Máel Coluim's death in 997, the kingship appears to have passed to a certain Owain ap Dyfnwal, a man who seems to have been yet another son of Dyfnwal.Clarkson (2014) ch. 7 ¶ 17; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 41; Woolf (2007) pp. 222, 233, 236.

Owain Foel clearly lived on years afterwards, and there is no reason to disregard the obituaries as erroneous. If the like-named men are indeed different people, they could well have been closely related, with the latter perhaps being a son of Owain ap Dyfnwal's brother, Máel Coluim. The likelihood that there were indeed two contemporary Cumbrian rulers named Owain could account for Owain Foel's epithet (meaning \\"the bald\\").Hicks (2003) pp. 43 n. 106, 44.

There is a degree of uncertainty as to the identity of the man who mounted the English defence. According to Historia regum Anglorum, Uhtred commanded the English forces.McGuigan (2015a) pp. 122–123; Clarkson (2014) ch. 8, 8 n. 14; Walker (2013) ch. 5; Aird (2004); Broun (2004c) p. 128 n. 66; Duncan (2002) p. 28; Anderson (1908) p. 82; Arnold (1885) pp. 155–156 ch. 130; Stevenson (1855) p. 527. A passage preserved by the ninth- to twelfth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, however, may indicate that this man had been slain two years beforehand, perhaps revealing that it was actually Uhtred's succeeding brother, Eadwulf Cudel, Earl of Northumbria, who commanded the English troops.Clarkson (2014) ch. 8; Woolf (2007) pp. 236–237; Duncan (2002) p. 28; Swanton (1998) pp. 148–149.

For Owain Foel and the Cumbrians, the successful outcome of the campaign would have probably meant a surplus of plunder: including cattle, slaves, and other valuables. It is also possible that the territorial extent of the Cumbrian realm was enlarged by way of the Northumbrian defeat. For instance, a twelfth-century inquest of the landholdings of the Bishop of Glasgow—undertaken at a time when the realm had long since been absorbed by the Scots—appears to identify territories formerly encapsulated within the kingdom. The fact that this inquest included Teviotdale, an important part of what had been Northumbrian territory, could indicate that this region had been annexed by the Cumbrians as a result of the victory at Carham.Clarkson (2014) ch. 8; Broun (2004c) p. 139 n. 117; Barrow (1999) pp. 60–61 § 15; Registrum Episcopatus Glasguensis (1843) pp. 1–5 § 1. Death and Cumbrian contraction Penrith. The stones display significant Scandinavian influences, and are traditionally associated with a legendary king, variably known as Owain Caesarius. It is possible that this figure refers to Owain Foel, or any of the tenth- and eleventh-century Cumbrian kings who bore the same name.Clarkson (2010) ch. 10; Proceedings (1947) pp. 221–225; Collingwood (1923). Owain Foel's death date is unknown. Although it is possible that he died at the battle,Parsons (2011) p. 130 n. 42; Broun (2015a); Clarkson (2014) ch. 8; Clarkson (2013); Oram, RD (2011) chs. 2, 5; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9; Clancy (2006); Kapelle (1979) p. 38. or else soon after,Broun (2004b). there is no specific evidence that he was indeed killed or mortally wounded.Clarkson (2014) ch. 8; Broun (2004c) p. 139 n. 117. In fact, he could well have lived and reigned long afterwards.Clarkson (2014) ch. 9; Clarkson (2013); Broun (2004c) pp. 128, 139 n. 117. Whatever the case, it may have been upon his death that Máel Coluim mac Cináeda seized control of the kingdom.Broun (2015a); Broun (2015b); Broun (2004b); Oram, R (2001); Kapelle (1979) pp. 38–39. If the latter had indeed done so in the near aftermath of Carham, such an acquisition would have taken place at the height of his power. There may be reason to suggest that Owain Foel died sometime before 1030, perhaps leaving a weak heir or vacated throne.Clarkson (2010) ch. 9. Certainly, the fourteenth- century Annals of Tigernach records a ravaging inflicted upon Britons that year by the English and the Scandinavians of Dublin.Clarkson (2014) ch. 8 n. 48; Edmonds (2014) p. 210, 210 n. 88; Clarkson (2013); Clarkson (2010) ch. 9; The Annals of Tigernach (2010) § 1030.11; Woolf (2007) p. 254; Annals of Tigernach (2005) § 1030.11; Broun (2004c) pp. 136–137. Another historical episode that may cast light upon the fate of the Cumbrian realm concerns an assembly of northern kings in about 1031. Specifically in about 1031, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records a concord between Knútr, Máel Coluim mac Cináeda, Mac Bethad mac Findlaích, and Echmarcach mac Ragnaill. The fact that no Cumbrian king is recorded at this royal assembly seems to reveal that no such king reigned by this date, and may indicate that the Cumbrian realm then formed part of the Scottish Kingdom of Alba.Clarkson (2013); Duncan (2002) p. 29. The rationale behind the meeting of the four kings is uncertain. One possibility—amongst many—is that it concerned the collapse of the Kingdom of Strathclyde,Broun (2004c) p. 137 n. 112; Hicks (2003) p. 44 n. 107. and perhaps had something to do with the recorded ravaging of 1030.Clarkson (2013); Broun (2004c) p. 137 n. 112.

As such, the appear to have expanded deep into what had formerly been Cumbrian-controlled territories.Parsons (2011) pp. 132, 139; Clarkson (2010) ch. 9 ¶ 48; Clancy (2008) p. 37; Broun (2004c) pp. 136–138, 139 n. 117. There is reason to suspect that this encroachment was connected to the eleventh-century decline and demise of the Kingdom of Strathclyde.Parsons (2011) pp. 132, 139; Clancy (2008) p. 37; Woolf (2007) p. 254, 254 n. 49; Broun (2004c) p. 136. Such an expansion could have taken place with the demise of Owain Foel himself. In fact, Suibne could have been the leader of the who expedited the undoing of the Cumbrian regime, and oversaw the acquisition of much the kingdom's western territories.Broun (2004c) p. 136.

Such a move may explain the Scots' failure to immediately exploit their victory over the English in 1018, and could indicate that the Scottish king's resources were instead projected against the vulnerable Cumbrian realm.Kapelle (1979) pp. 38–39, 41, 247–248 n. 39.

Although the Pedersen was rated for a time as the most likely candidate for standardization and adoption, the .30 caliber M1 Garand was chosen instead.Canfield, Bruce. \\"Garand vs. Pedersen,\\" American Rifleman, July 2009. Background The U.S. Army had shown interest in the idea of self-loading (semiautomatic) rifles before World War I. Combat experience during that war had made clear two general points: that the standard caliber .30-06 rifle cartridge was excessively powerful for the ranges (500 yards and less) where infantry combat was likely to take place, and that bolt-action rifles such as the M1903 Springfield were seriously lacking in firepower and second-shot hit capability. The U.S. Army Ordnance Bureau had no problem in soliciting designs and prototype weapons from inventors, and sought to facilitate their work by supplying barrels and other hardware that the inventors were likely not to be able to fabricate. However, such a traditional way of developing new weapons all too often saw potentially worthwhile designs wash out of the testing process due to a lack of engineering skills and experience both in the design and manufacturing phases. Testing in the early 1920s led the Ordnance Bureau to identify three rifle designs - the Bang rifle, the Thompson Autorifle, and the primer-protrusion actuated Garand Model 1919 rifle - as promising candidates. However, all three designs were burdened with the high pressure and heat generating characteristics of the .30-06 ammunition, which looked likely to result in a weapon too heavy and too subject to overheating to be worthwhile. Trials with a small number of \\"militarized\\" .25 Remington autoloading rifles, despite their unsuitability for combat, provided a body of practical experience with semiautomatic rifles and an appreciation for the idea less powerful ammunition might be a critical part of the successful development of such weapons. Proposals At this point in time, John Douglas Pedersen made an unsolicited proposal to the Army Ordnance Bureau which would have a profound impact on the entire effort to develop a serviceable semiautomatic rifle. In essence, he proposed to develop a rifle that would be neither recoil operated (which would involve excessive recoil and generate inaccuracy, due to the barrel moving within the rifle) nor gas operated (which would be complex, heavy, and potentially give undesirable operating characteristics). Additionally, he proposed to develop a new cartridge in the caliber .256 to .276 (6.5 mm to 7 mm) range that, while less powerful than the .30-06, would be effective out to 300 yards. Pedersen had gained a good reputation as both a firearms designer and production engineer at the Remington Arms Company. While at Remington, he designed four notable commercial firearms. Pedersen also designed the Pedersen Device during World War I. This was a sub-firearm intended to allow battlefield conversion of Springfield and M1917 Enfield rifles into semiautomatic rifles firing a pistol-sized cartridge. The Bureau of Ordnance was sufficiently impressed that in 1923 it granted Mr. Pedersen a contract providing office space, a project budget, an annual salary, and in compensation for his departure from Remington the right to patent his work and collect royalties from the U.S. Government if his rifle was adopted. Development of the rifle and cartridge Pedersen got to work in 1924, focusing first on the cartridge. The .276 Pedersen (7 x 51 mm) cartridge as finally standardized and manufactured at Frankford Arsenal was shorter than the .30-06, one quarter lighter, would generate nearly a third less heat and about half the recoil energy. Despite being smaller, it had a trajectory similar to the .30-06., with a muzzle velocity of 2,600 feet per second (792 m/s). The drawbacks of the design were diminished tracer performance, less effective armor piercing, plus anticipated logistical complications coming from the fact the .30-06 would remain in use for machine guns. The cartridge did, however, make a reasonably light yet effective semiautomatic rifle possible. By early 1926, Pedersen had designed and built a prototype rifle. He had researched Army tactics and operational concepts, and had engineered the tooling for parts manufacture as an integral part of engineering the gun parts themselves. Such an application of sound research and development made a very strong impression on Army personnel when the rifle was presented for inspection and testing. The rifle was a solid, well-finished weapon, 44 inches (112 cm) long, weighing slightly over 8 pounds (3.6 kg). It utilized a disposable ten-round en bloc clip, a system favored at the time. Pedersen's rifle utilized a sophisticated up-breaking toggle-joint system like the Parabellum P.08Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare (London: Phoebus, 1978), Volume 19, p.2092, \\"Pedersen\\". but improved by utilizing delayed blowback. This system was simple and free of both the fragility and severe kick of recoil operation, and the weight and complexity of gas operation (as in the Browning Automatic Rifle). To ease extraction, cartridge cases were coated in mineral wax.Hatcher, Julian. (1947). Hatcher's Notebook. The Military Service Press Company. p. 38-44 This left a thin film that was “hard, and durable, and was not sticky,”.Hatcher, The Book of the Garand, p.69. The waxed cases solved the issue of difficult extraction, but hindered acceptance of the Pedersen rifle because officials feared that the wax would attract dirt and cause operating failures. Testing and evaluation En-bloc clip loaded with 10 rounds of .276 Pedersen. Image from John Pedersen patent. In February 1926, the new rifle and ammunition were tested in the presence of representatives of both the Army Chief of Infantry and the Chief of Cavalry. The results were “highly favorable”Hatcher, p.72. Production was authorized on May 20, 1926 of 20 rifles and 5 carbines. Following tests of reworked versions of the Thompson and primer-actuated Garand rifles, the Infantry Board in June, 1926 recommended further testing of all three rifles, but clearly indicated in its report the Pedersen rifle was the most developed of the three. In April 1928 came the Infantry Board test report on the T1E3, and it was a solid endorsement of the rifle. The Board called for adoption of the T1E3 rifle to replace both the Model 1903 Springfield and the Browning Automatic Rifle. The Cavalry Board was also positive in its own evaluation of the T1E3. To soldiers used to the heavy recoil and exhausting manual operation of the Springfield rifle, the moderate recoil and self-loading functionality of the T1 rifle clearly must have made an impression. Due to problems with primer-actuation, John Garand gave up work on a .30-06 semiautomatic rifle and also focused exclusively on caliber .276. Doubts about the lethal effect of the .276 round were strong enough to result in extensive tests in June and July 1928 by the “Pig Board” (so called because lethality tests were carried out on anaesthetized pigs). The Board found all three rounds (.256, .276, and .30) were wounding out to 1,200 yards (1100m). At 300 yards, the smaller .256 caliber round delivered \\"by far the most severe wounds in all parts of the animal.\\" At 600 yards the results were similar for all three rounds. No compelling case could be made against the Pedersen round. Further tests and a final decision In July 1928, the War Department created the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps Semiautomatic Rifle Board to further test and evaluate both existing and newly submitted rifles with an eye toward focusing on standardizing the most serviceable design. Unlike previous boards, this one would continue to function for three years, and would end up undertaking three series of tests. This Board displayed a strong interest in the development of a .30-'06 semiautomatic rifle, but at the same time recognized the potential effectiveness of the .276 round at ranges up to 600 yards and that relatively light weight rifles that could be built around it; the Board remained consistent with the de facto Army policy of favoring adoption of the .276 round. Counting the Pedersen T1E3 rifle (by this time covered by ), seven rifles were submitted for consideration. One of these rifles was John Garand's gas-operated .276 rifle, the T3, which had a 10-round magazine loaded with a symmetrical en bloc clip. Pedersen toggle-delayed blowback action. Image from John Pedersen patent. The conclusion of the tests, held in August 1929, saw the Board rate the T1E3 and the T3 as superior to all the others. Both rifles were found to be subject to excessive malfunctions, but the T3 was rated superior to the T1E3. Specific T1E3 defects were: failure of the breech mechanism to close, misfires, breech mechanism override (failure to feed), and breakage of a crank and a sear bar. The Board recommended manufacturing of 20 T3 rifles for service test, and in addition recommended building a caliber .30-'06 version of the T3 for evaluation. Cartridge lethality was again investigated by the “Goat Board”, this time with shooting tests on anaesthetized goats and careful measurement of entry and exit velocities. However, the test results again demonstrated no superiority of caliber .30 ammunition at normal combat ranges. The year 1931 saw testing of the T1E3 and the twenty T3E2 rifles by the Infantry. The Infantry Board rated the T3E2 superior in effective firepower and simplicity of construction (the T3E2 had 60 parts, while the T1E3 had 99 parts). This Board, which three years earlier had recommended adoption of the T1, now favored the T3E2; it continued to favor the .276. However, the Chief of Infantry broke with the Infantry Board and stated a preference for .30 caliber. The .30-'06 Garand rifle (essentially an enlarged T3E2) was quickly built and, under the confusing designation T1E1, was tested along with the T3E2 and the Pedersen T1E3 during the remainder of 1931. The Semiautomatic Rifle Board now exhibited a notably critical attitude toward the T1E3. The Board found fault with the requirement for lubricated cartridge cases (seemingly regardless of the technical merits of Mr. Pedersen's case treatment concept), poor trigger pull, and the upward break of the breech mechanism. A more substantive complaint had to do with the complete exposure of the breech mechanism when held open—the Board correctly cited the vulnerability of the rifle to mud and dust while in this condition. The Board also reported slamfires (the Garand T3E2 was reported to dimple cartridge primers with its firing pin, but did not slamfire). In the end, funding issues forced a decision. Faced with the possible loss of funds already authorized by Congress, the Board met for one more time in January 1932 and decided to recommend approval of the T3E2 (the .276 Garand) for limited procurement by the Army and to continue development of the T1E1 (the .30-'06 Garand). With this action, the Pedersen rifle was effectively dropped from consideration. In four more years, almost to the day, an improved version of rifle T1E1 would be adopted as the M1. As Springfield Armory tooled for and refined the Garand, Pedersen continued to work on another rifle. He developed a .30 caliber model with a conventional gas-trap piston and multi-piece operating rod system. He fought to have it tested by the U.S. Army prior to World War II. At around the same time, serious difficulties were being encountered with the Garand and questions had been raised. Both Pedersen and Melvin M. Johnson, Jr. attempted to capitalize on the troubles. Based on serial numbers, it is thought up to 12 prototype gas-trap Pedersen rifles were made. One example of the model G-Y resides at the Springfield Armory Museum.Springfield Armory Collection Foreign interest Publicity of the U.S. Army's serious consideration of adopting the Pedersen rifle as standard issue generated similar interest in the rifle in the United Kingdom. Pedersen traveled to the UK in 1930 to oversee tooling up of a production facility by Vickers-Armstrong for manufacturing of rifles for test by the UK Government and for possible marketing to other countries. The UK tested the rifle in 1932 along with other prototype semiautomatic rifles, but decided not to take any further action. Vickers apparently both manufactured the rifle in small quantities and also further developed the design. A caliber .276 Vickers- Pedersen rifle offered for sale in March 2008 by the James D. Julia Auction firm was serial numbered 95, and the clip that accompanied the rifle was of a curved and symmetrical design (suitable for loading into the magazine either end up). The butt stock had a noticeably different shape than those of rifles made at Springfield Armory, but otherwise the rifle was identical to the U.S. production T1E3 and thus incorporated the design revisions covered by to make his rifle more modular in construction and thus easier to disassemble and maintain. =Japanese Pedersen= Pedersen reportedly then went to Japan to encourage interest in his rifle by the Imperial Japanese Army, which appears to have led to the building of 12 rifles and 12 carbines for testing around 1935; the project reportedly was abandoned in 1936. These weapons were apparently made to fire the standard 6.5 mm Japanese service cartridge, and incorporated design changes which radically changed the appearance of this rifle when compared to the original T1E3 rifle. Most notable was the use of a spool-type Schoenauer magazine which formed a very pronounced swell in the stock just ahead of the trigger guard. A receiver-mounted safety lever and a stripper clip guide at the front of the breech block head are also noticeable features. A ventilated wooden handguard completely covers the barrel, while the stock furniture more resembles that of the later Type 99 rifle than the then-standard Type 38. The sights are offset to the left, although the cycling of the breech block mechanism would still momentarily interrupt the line of sight. The hinge pin was also made removable. Reportedly the Japanese Army did not really grasp the importance of case lubrication for this type of rifle, so the test rifles never really functioned satisfactorily. A carbine version, serial number 5, has been recently described in some detail. A photo of a field stripped rifle or carbine, reportedly of a specimen found in Japan at the end of World War II, has been reproduced in Hatcher's The Book of the Garand and some other gun books. Legacy While the Pedersen rifle never achieved the status of a standard-issue weapon of the U.S. Army, the rifle did have a visible impact on the process by which the ultimate winner—the M1 Garand rifle—was selected. John Pedersen's work in creating and improving his rifle was a coherent research and development process which significantly raised the bar for those trying to get a hearing from Army Ordnance regarding their designs. Tellingly, the only serious competition that the Pedersen rifle had in the end was the rifle created by John C. Garand—like Pedersen, a talented designer and engineer with a solid grounding in the particulars of production tooling. The initial success and ultimate failure of the Pedersen rifle has sometimes been interpreted as the simple workings-out of biased or overly conservative decision-making in the face of technological innovation. However, there is little in the historical record to support such interpretations. Simply put, the Pedersen rifle had shortcomings. The rifle was complex, making concerns about mass production to an exacting standard of parts interchangeability quite legitimate. Issues revealed in Army tests were serious and inherent in the design. Certainly the concerns expressed by the Semiautomatic Rifle Board regarding the vulnerability of the operating mechanism to sand and mud when held open were very real. However, what the rifle did succeed in demonstrating was that a semiautomatic combat rifle was a realistic proposition. The initial enthusiasm of the Infantry Board for the adoption of this rifle is certainly strong testimony on this point. Bias is certainly visible in the negative attitude taken toward what was unquestionably the most innovative aspect of the rifle's development: the lubrication of the cartridge cases with Pedersen's dry wax process. The implicit equation of this process with the messy and contamination-vulnerable case oiling system used in the Thompson Rifle (also a hesitation blowback design) certainly shows a degree of obstinate conservatism. This concept may yet have potential application in firearms development even now, but it was certainly not appreciated or even liked back in the 1920s. Some writers have implied that the Pedersen rifle was effectively killed by Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur’s decision to require use of the .30-06 cartridge for the standard semiautomatic rifle. However, the record does not support such an interpretation. The Pedersen rifle was rejected a month before Gen. MacArthur pronounced on the subject, at a point in time when the caliber .276 T3E2 Garand rifle was the clear winner of the competition and ready for initial production. History shows MacArthur vetoed the .276 Pedersen cartridge for use in the Garand rifle. Description and operation The Pedersen T1E3 rifle was made in two versions: an infantry rifle with a 24-inch barrel, full-length stock with an M1903-type front band, 44 inches long (twenty made); and a cavalry carbine with a 21-inch barrel and half-stocked like the Krag-Jørgensen cavalry carbine (five made). An unknown but larger number of infantry rifles were made by Vickers-Armstrong in Britain. The infantry rifle had a planned weight of 8 pounds, 2 ounces; weights of the rifles tested by the Infantry Board averaged out at 9 pounds, 2 ounces. The walnut stock had a semi pistol grip of rather shallow contour and a pronounced drop at the butt with a long cheek rest formed on top of the butt. A ventilated metal handguard covered the barrel only between the receiver and the lower band. Under the handguard was a thicken section of the barrel machined with 12 spiraling grooves, the whole design evidently intended to provide both heat sink and radiant air cooling effect. (The metal handguard was a point of criticism during Army tests due to it becoming too hot to the touch after moderate firing; the lack of uniform wood covering of the barrel was judged the cause of accuracy problems due to uneven expansion of the hot barrel). The built-in ten-round magazine included a steel lower body that protruded below the bottom of the stock approximately one inch ahead of a conventional milled steel trigger guard; this magazine body had smooth and distinctive contours that reflected both the shapes of the feed mechanism parts and the designer's evident concern for the soldier's ease of use and safety. The front sight was an unprotected M1903 blade; the rear sight, mounted at the extreme rear of the receiver, was a protected peep sight of original design adjustable for windage and elevation. The receiver was entirely open on top between the barrel ring and the rear sight mount. The stubby, flat operating handle for the toggle joint breech mechanism protruded to the right from the forward part of the crank (the rearmost part of the breech mechanism). The breech block mechanism was made in three parts. From front to rear they were: # The breech block head; this part supported the cartridge base. # The body; this was linked to Number 1 and Number 3. # The crank; this was secured to the rear of the receiver with the hinge pin. The Pedersen rifle operated on the hesitation blowback principle: energy released by firing a cartridge immediately caused the breech to start moving rearward, but mechanical leverage built into the mechanism caused the actual opening of the breech to be delayed long enough so that pressure within the barrel would fall to a safe level. This was achieved with a bearing surface machined onto the front end of the crank. As the case head pressed on the breech block head and forced it to move rearward (as guided by contact surfaces in the receiver), pressure was exerted on the body, which in turn exerted pressure on the crank. The crank had contact surfaces on its rear end which would transmit pressure to corresponding surfaces in the rear of the receiver, thus relieving the hinge pin of excessive stress. As the rear surface of the body continued to exert pressure on the bearing surface on the front of the crank, the leverage exerted would cause the crank to move about 95 degrees upward from the horizontal on the fulcrum formed by it being attached to the rear of the receiver by the hinge pin. The breech block mechanism thus operated in a manner resembling the operation of the Luger pistol, but unlike that pistol the Pedersen mechanism was at no time mechanically locked. The operating principle was the same as that used in the Model 07/12 Schwarzlose machine gun used by Austria-Hungary during the First World War. As with all hesitation blowback weapons, the Pedersen rifle had to have some means to prevent cartridge cases from becoming stuck in the chamber due to the relatively high breech pressure and operating velocity existing at the moment of extraction. The measure adopted by the designer was the sophisticated case coating technique described earlier, which in combination with the taper of the cartridge case sides undoubtedly contributed to the high degree of reliability noted in all Army tests. Use of uncoated-case rounds (intentionally done in at least one test) caused the rifle to completely fail to function. Starting with the rifle unloaded and the breech mechanism closed, the loading and operating cycle would be as follows. # Grasping the operating handle with the right hand, the operator would pull the crank up and back until vertical, at which point the hold open device would engage the underside of the breech block head. The breech return spring, entirely housed within the crank, would at this point be fully compressed. # An asymmetrical spring steel clip of ten rounds in a double-staggered column would then be inserted, feed end up, into the magazine against the spring pressure of the magazine follower; when fully inserted the clip would be caught and held by a catch. (Note: this clip, like the clip used in the Austrian Model 95 rifle, could only be inserted one way and thus could potentially cause confusion under the stress of combat). Unloading the magazine would be done by (if necessary) retracting and holding open the breech mechanism, then pushing the trigger forward from its neutral position; the clip and any remaining cartridges would be ejected upward. # By pulling back slightly on the operating handle, the operator would then free the breech block head from the hold open device and under pressure from the operating spring the breech block mechanism would straighten, driving the breech block head forward to push the topmost cartridge forward from under the feed lips of the clip, chambering the cartridge, and engaging the extraction groove around the base of the cartridge with the extractor. The extractor and the spring-loaded plunger type ejector were both built into breech block head. If the rifle was not immediately to be fired, the spring-loaded striker assembly (housed within the breech block head and body) could be locked by pushing the cross-bolt safety located in the breech body from right to left; this would also lock the breech block mechanism so that it could not be opened. (Army test reports identified the safety and the firing mechanism as weak areas of the T1 rifle: the safety, when applied, prevented clearing a loaded chamber and did not lock the trigger mechanism; the safety was also subject to damage. The striker was reported to have become stuck on some occasions, causing slam-fires). # With the rifle ready to fire, pressing the trigger would cause movement of a connector bar extending forward toward the magazine well; the connector bar movement would then cause the sear to move out of engagement with the striker and cause the chambered round to fire. (In common with bullpup rifles, which also separate the trigger from the firing mechanism, the T1 was reported to suffer from a relatively poor trigger pull feel; during at least one series of tests the connector bar broke). When the breech block mechanism cycled, the crank would momentarily block the line of sight (Army riflemen testing this rifle apparently got used to this effect quickly, but there were negative comments in the test reports regarding the crank striking the edge of the Brodie helmet then standard issue in the U.S. Army as well as damaging the brims of the felt campaign hats then worn as part of the field uniform). # When the last round in the clip was chambered and then fired, final upward movement of the magazine follower would engage the hold open device, which would catch and hold the breech block head in the open position; the empty clip would be ejected upward. The breech block mechanism could be released by depressing the follower and pulling back slightly on the operating handle. (The T1 and the Cal .276 Garand both had a tendency to hold open their actions and eject clips while one round still remained in the magazine). Basic field stripping of the T1 rifle was simple: with the rifle unloaded and the mechanism held open, pressing on a stud on the underside of the crank would lock the breech return spring. The breech block head could then be guided up and out through inclined guide ways in the receiver and the crank then could be freed from the hinge pin, allowing the entire breech mechanism to be removed as a unit. The magazine housing would then be dismounted by pressing forward on the housing until the forward retaining lip would become free from the groove in the forward part of the receiver that it normally rested in and then rotating the housing downward. The entire trigger and feed mechanism group would then be removed by pressing a spring-loaded cross bolt at the rear of the trigger guard just below the stock; the entire assembly would then be freed to be pulled down and rearward to separate it from the receiver and stock. The general concept of the field stripping process is similar to that of the SKS carbine. The stock and barrel-receiver assembly would normally not be separated, following the pattern of rifles such as the German Model 98 Mauser or the Model 1903 Springfield.

S. Forester. It was adapted into the 1951 film of the same name. Plot summary The story opens in August/September 1914. Rose Sayer, a 33-year-old Englishwoman, is the companion and housekeeper of her brother Samuel, an Anglican missionary in German East Africa (present-day Tanzania). World War I has recently begun, and the German military commander of the area has conscripted all the natives; the village is deserted, and only Rose and her dying brother remain. Samuel dies during the night and Rose is alone. That day, another man arrives at the village: this is an English Cockney named Allnutt, who is the mechanic and skipper of the African Queen, a steam-powered launch, owned by a Belgian mining corporation, that plies the upper reaches of the Ulanga River. Allnutt's two-man crew has deserted him at the rumours of war and conscription. Allnutt buries Samuel Sayer and takes Rose back to the African Queen, where they consider what they should do. The African Queen is well- stocked with tinned food, and carries a cargo of two hundredweight of blasting gelignite. It also holds two large tanks of oxygen and hydrogen. Rose is inflamed with patriotism, and also filled with the desire to avenge the insults the Germans piled on her brother. It occurs to her that the main German defence against a British attack by water is the gunboat Königin Luise, which guards the fictional Lake WittelsbachGiles Foden. Mimi and Toutou Go Fourth: The Bizarre Battle of Lake Tanganyika into which the Ulanga feeds. She asks Allnutt if he can make the gelignite into a makeshift torpedo. Allnutt replies that that is not possible, but after some thought, he concludes that by loading the gelignite inside the emptied tanks, putting the tanks into the bow of the launch, and rigging a detonator, they could turn the African Queen itself into a sort of large torpedo. Allnutt is inclined to laugh off the idea, but he gives in to Rose's greater strength of will and the two of them set off down the Ulanga, Rose steering and Allnutt maintaining the launch's ancient, balky, wood-burning steam engine. The descent to the lake poses three main problems: passing the German-held town of Shona; passing the heavy rapids and cataracts; and getting through the river delta. After many days on the river, they come close to Shona, and Allnutt's nerve fails; he refuses to take the launch under fire, anchors in a backwater, and gets drunk on gin. Unable to work the launch single-handed, Rose sets out to make Allnutt's life miserable until he agrees to her plan; while he is asleep she pours all his gin overboard, then refuses to speak to him. The weak-willed Allnutt eventually gives in and the African Queen gets under way again. They come in sight of Shona at midday; the German commander assumes the launch is coming in to surrender (because he believes no boat could pass the rapids below the town, so Shona is the only possible destination); he does not realise his mistake until too late, and though he and his men open fire, the launch receives only minor damage. Below the town, the African Queen spends several days shooting the rapids; Allnutt is exhilarated, and he and Rose are reconciled and become lovers. Rose, embarrassed, admits that she does not know Allnutt's first name; he tells her it is Charlie. On the third day the launch strikes on rocks while passing another rapid; she loses way and does not respond well to the tiller, so they are forced to anchor in the lee of a rock outcropping. Allnutt dives and finds that the driveshaft is bent and the propeller has lost one of its blades. Over the next weeks they slowly repair the damage without being able to beach the launch; Allnutt has to dive again and again to remove the shaft and propeller. On shore they gather wood and construct a makeshift bellows to heat the shaft so Allnutt can straighten it. Then Allnutt makes a new propeller blade out of scrap iron and bolts it to the stump of the old blade. After numerous dives to fix the shaft and propeller, they continue on their way and eventually pass the rapids, coming out of the Ulanga River into the larger Bora River, which feeds into the lake. Passing the river delta is long and arduous. Tormented by myriads of biting insects, sickened with malaria, and wracked by the terrible heat and powerful thunderstorms, they drag the launch through miles of reeds and water-grass with their boat-hooks, occasionally diving to cut fallen logs out of their way. Even the shallow launch (which has a draft of only thirty inches) constantly grounds on the thick mud. Finally, after weeks of exhausting labour, they emerge into the lake. They hide the launch in a stand of reeds and begin constructing the torpedo. Allnutt releases the gas from his two tanks and unscrews the valves, leaving a hole big enough for him to fill the tanks with gelignite, packed in mud. He cuts two holes in the front of the launch, right at the waterline, and fixes the two tanks there; he then constructs detonators from nails and revolver cartridges, so the gelignite will detonate on impact. All that is left is to pilot the launch right into the side of the Königin Luise, and the resulting explosion will destroy both vessels. They have been keeping track of the gunboat's habits, and choose a night when it will be anchored close to them. They argue about which of them should pilot the launch and which stay behind, but in the end they agree that they will both go. They fire up the engine and set out on the attack, but halfway to their target a sudden storm sweeps up out of nowhere and overwhelms them; the African Queen sinks, and Rose and Allnutt have to swim for safety. The two lovers are separated in the storm, but both are captured by the Germans the next day. They are brought before the captain of the Königin Luise to be tried as spies. Both refuse to say how they came to the lake, but the captain sees \\"African Queen\\" written on Rose's life-saver and deduces that they must be the mechanic and the missionary's sister from the mysteriously missing launch. He decides it would be uncivilised to execute them, so he flies a flag of truce and delivers them to the British naval commander, who dismissively sends them to separate tents under guard while he takes his newly arrived reinforcements out to sink the Königin Luise. Having succeeded in this, he sends Rose and Allnutt to the coast to speak to the British Consul, where he advises Allnutt to enlist in the British Army. Rose and Allnutt agree that when they reach the coast they will ask the Consul to marry them. The story ends with the narrator's comment that \\"Whether or not they lived happily ever after is not easily decided.\\" The MV Liemba was the inspiration for the German gunboat. Film adaptation The novel was made into a film in 1951: The African Queen, starring Humphrey Bogart as Charlie Allnutt and Katharine Hepburn as Rose Sayer. Allnutt is changed to a Canadian in the film to explain Bogart's accent. In the film, the German captain prepares to hang Rose and Charlie. At Charlie's request, the captain marries them. The hull of the African Queen, both torpedoes still in place, floats just below the surface of the lake. Charlie and Rose are on deck, nooses around their necks, and crewmen are about to tie their hands behind them when there is a loud thud, followed by explosions. The Königin Luise swiftly keels over, capsizing completely in 30 seconds. Singing, Charlie and Rose swim for the east shore and safety.

The current Gaelic name is likely a neologism: the bridge was not built until the early 19th century and some early gravestones show the name sgudal or scuddle. One suggested source is the Old Norse \\"sku dal\\", valley of the fine views. Situated near the market town of Dingwall, on the southern bank of the River Conon, in Ross-shire, it is at the western end of the Cromarty Firth. The village of Maryburgh is on the other side of the river. Conon Bridge has a railway station on the line between Dingwall (the nearest town) and Inverness (the nearest city), which re-opened on 8 February 2013. This had been proposed as a candidate for reopening after the success of doing so with nearby Beauly railway station. In September 2012 the Minister for Housing and Transport Keith Brown confirmed it would reopen by February 2013 to offer an alternative to commuters during resurfacing work on the Kessock Bridge from February to June 2013. Amenities at present are a small fraction of what they once were, hosting a Spar shop, Post Office, two hairdressing salons, a bar and separate hotel. It also has its own primary school, whose pupils then go on to Dingwall Academy. There is also a recently opened pharmacy and a Co-op store opened in 2017. The only church situated within the village itself is the Ferintosh Parish Church, a growing Church of Scotland congregation. Private housing in the village is complemented by council estates. Future plans for the village include more exclusive, private housing schemes, a new primary school, a doctors' surgery and more shopping facilities for residents. A new small shopping complex opened up on the east side of the village in early 2017.

History The station opened on 1 September 1884 as Sefton, and was renamed in 1886 as Sefton and Maghull. The station first closed in 1917, along with all other stations on the extension line, as a WWI economy measure. The station was reopened on 1 April 1919, and continued in use until 7 January 1952, when the SCLER was closed to passengers from Aintree Central to Southport Lord Street. The line remained open for public goods traffic until 7 July 1952 at Southport Lord St., Birkdale Palace and Altcar & Hillhouse Stations. Public goods facilities were ended at Woodvale, Lydiate and Sefton & Maghull stations on the same date as passenger services (7 January 1952*) and there were never any goods facilities at Ainsdale Beach station to begin with. After 7 July 1952, a siding remained open at Altcar & Hillhouse for private goods facilities until May 1960. The very last passenger train to run on the SCLER was a railway enthusiasts 'special' between Aintree and Altcar and Hillhouse railways stations on 6 June 1959. The official day of a closure is given as the Monday following the date of the last train to run.

He was on trial in Italy from 2005 to just before his death in 2012, on charges of conspiring to traffic in looted antiquities artifacts. Personal life Robert Hecht was born in Baltimore, Maryland. He was a descendant of the family that founded The Hecht Company, a chain of department stores based in Baltimore, where he grew up. He graduated from Haverford College in 1941, having majored in Latin, was a naval officer during World War II, and after it spent a stint as interpreter at the War Crimes Investigation in Nuremberg and one year at the University of Zurich studying archaeology and classical philology before winning a Rome Prize Fellowship for the American Academy in Rome (1947–49). In 1953 he married Elizabeth Chase, a graduate student of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Robert Hecht had three daughters: Daphne Howat by his first marriage to Anita Liebman; and Andrea and Donatella Hecht by his marriage to Ms. Chase. He lived for many years in Paris and died at home there.Weber, Bruce. \\"Robert Hecht, Antiquities Dealer, Dies at 92.\\" The New York Times. 19 February 2012. Career Hecht made his first significant sales in the 1950s, including the dispersal of the collection of Ludwig Curtius, former director of the German Archaeological Institute in Rome, and later the sale of a late 6th century BCE red figure vase to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In the 1960s and 1970s he reached a pre-eminent position in the trade. Known throughout the museum world for his scholarship and his 'eye' for antiquities, he sold to all the world's major museums including the British Museum, the Louvre, the Metropolitan, the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and to many private collectors all over the world. Other dealers tended to give him first refusal on their 'finds'. It was a period when major museums and serious collectors in Europe, the U.S., and Japan did not feel it their responsibility to enforce the export laws of southern European countries. Hecht always worked on the assumption that it was the preservation and study of ancient art that really mattered, not provenance. In the 1970s Bruce McNall was his \\"secret United States partner.\\"Hoving, Thomas, Making the Mummies Dance, New York: Simon & Schuster. =Provenance issues= The sale of a Euphronios krater to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for $1 million in 1972 catapulted Hecht into instant fame and international problems. The Italians claimed that the vase was excavated illegally in Cerveteri, north of Rome. An American Grand Jury, investigating the Euphronios krater at the request of the Italians -- whose evidence came from a tomb robber -- found the provenance unproven. However, in 2006, continuing pressure from Italy led Philippe de Montebello, director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, to negotiate a deal which gave the Italians ownership of the vase. Hecht had wrangles with both the Italian and Turkish authorities but was acquitted in the only lawsuit to reach Italy's Supreme Court of Cassation (Suprema Corte di Cassazione). J. Paul Getty Museum controversy In 2005 Hecht was indicted by the Italian government, together with Marion True, the former curator of antiquities at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, for conspiracy to traffic in illegal antiquities. The primary evidence in the case came from the 1995 raid of a Geneva, Switzerland warehouse which had contained a fortune in stolen artifacts. Italian art dealer Giacomo Medici was eventually arrested in 1997; his operation was thought to be \\"one of the largest and most sophisticated antiquities networks in the world, responsible for illegally digging up and spiriting away thousands of top-drawer pieces and passing them on to the most elite end of the international art market\\".Men's Vogue, Nov/Dec 2006, Vol. 2, No. 3, pg. 46. Medici was sentenced in 2004 by a Rome court to ten years in prison and a fine of 10 million euros, \\"the largest penalty ever meted out for antiquities crime in Italy\\". The court hearings of the case against Hecht and True ended in 2012 and 2010, respectively, as the statute of limitations, under Italian law, for their alleged crimes had expired.Povoledo, Elisabetta. \\"Italian Trial of American Antiquities Dealer Comes to an End.\\" The New York Times. 18 January 2012.

Brady was previously the head men's basketball coach at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. On February 8, 2008, LSU dismissed Brady, and named his assistant coach, Butch Pierre, the interim head coach for the remainder of the season. On March 21, 2008 John Brady was named the 15th head basketball coach at Arkansas State University. Brady had coached the Tigers to an unlikely Final Four run in the 2006 NCAA Tournament, the fourth men's Final Four in LSU history. Early life and education Brady was born in McComb, Mississippi, about south of Jackson. He earned his BS from Belhaven College in 1976, where he played varsity basketball. He then received his master's in Education from Mississippi State University in 1977. Coaching career =Early career= After a year as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State, Brady began coaching in the high school ranks of Louisiana. In 1981 Brady was named the Louisiana Sports Writers Association Class AAA \\"Coach of the Year.\\" After returning to MSU to serve eight years as an assistant under Bob Boyd and Richard Williams, Brady was named head coach at Samford University in 1992. At the time of his departure, Brady was the winningest coach in Samford history, garnering an 89–77 record in six seasons. =LSU= In 1997, Brady replaced the legendary Dale Brown as head coach at LSU. When Brady arrived, the program was under probation and stinging from a recruiting scandal. Brady's first two years were rough. In 2000 the Tigers broke through, posting a 28–6 record and an NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 appearance. However, due to the loss of Stromile Swift and Jabari Smith to the 2000 NBA Draft, the Tigers could not carry their momentum to the next year, going 13–16 in 2001. Brady's team entered the 2005–06 season unranked, but were coming off a solid season in which they went 20–10 and made the NCAA Tournament. Led by Glen \\"Big Baby\\" Davis and Tyrus Thomas, the Tigers won their first outright SEC regular season championship since 1985, and earned a #4 seed in the NCAA Tournament. After wins over Iona and Texas A&M;, LSU defeated the #1 seed Duke and #2 seed Texas to make it to their first Final Four since 1986. Set at the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, Indiana, the 2006 Final Four was the first since 1980 to feature no #1 seeds (LSU, #2 UCLA, #3 Florida and #11 George Mason). Facing the #2 seed Bruins in the national semifinals, the Tigers were unable to solve UCLA's defense, losing 59–45, dropping LSU to 0-6 all-time in the men's Final Four (and 0–10 in all Final Four games, including an 0-4 mark in the women's Final Four). Despite the loss, the 2005–06 season will be remembered as one of the most successful in LSU men's basketball history. John Brady was fired in the middle of his 11th season as LSU's head basketball coach and just two seasons after the Tigers' latest Final Four appearance. In 10 seasons at LSU, Brady compiled a 184–126 record, including two SEC Regular Season Titles and four NCAA tournament appearances. On February 8, 2008, Brady was fired from LSU. Earlier news reports stated that he would coach the Tennessee game on February 9, but LSU officials stated that his termination was immediate. Brady's assistant coach, Butch Pierre, took over as the interim head coach. Brady is now the color commentator for radio broadcasts of LSU games. =Arkansas State= On March 18, 2008, Brady was hired by Arkansas State as head basketball coach. Brady won two division titles in the Sun Belt while the Red Wolves' coach, but was unable to ever get his team to the postseason and he announced at the beginning of the 2015–16 season that he would resign as coach, effective at the end of the season.http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/eye-on- college-basketball/25377561/arkansas-state-coach-john-brady-to-resign-at-end- of-2015-16-season Head coaching record Broadcasting career Brady became the LSU Tigers basketball color analyst starting in the 2017–2018 season.

The author has been complimented for the excellent depiction of the unforgiving Arctic environment; among others, the Times Literary Supplement gave it strongly favorable notices when it came out. Plot summary A BOAC airplane crash-lands on the Greenland ice cap far from its usual route after flying in a seemingly erratic fashion. An International Geophysical Year scientific research team based near the crash site rescues the surviving passengers and takes them to their cabin. Most of the flight crew are dead with one of the pilots having been shot in the back. The station's only means of contact with the outside world, a radio set, is destroyed in a seemingly accidental manner. With not enough food for everyone and no hope of rescue, the leader of the scientific research team, Dr Mason, decides that they must set out for the nearest settlement, some 300 kilometers away at the coast. Meanwhile, the pilot who was shot and in a coma is found to have been suffocated with a pillow in his sleep. An attempt is also made on Mason's life by getting him to be lost in the arctic night. The scientists' suspicion falls on the stewardess but she is soon cleared. Mason orders another scientist, Joss, to stay behind and try to repair the radio so that a field expedition can be contacted. The dead passenger is determined to be a military courier; soon after that the wreck goes up in flames. Mason leaves with the group along with the other scientist, Jackstraw, while remaining in touch with their station by means of a short range radio. Meanwhile, the field expedition returns to the station and contacts Mason. They inform him that a massive military mobilization has located the crashed plane and that it carried something very important. The government, having refused to divulge anything, had tried to contact Mason's station. Finding the station to be non- responding, they have requested the expedition chief, Captain Hillcrest, to investigate. Mason decides to go on with the journey since any attempt to return will induce the murderers to act. He keeps this new development to himself and Jackstraw. Hillcrest sets out after the group but soon finds that the petrol he picked up at the station has been tampered with. Sugar has been added to the petrol disabling the engine and leading him to get bogged down. A solution is found when one of the passengers, a chemist, suggests that the petrol be mixed with water and the top layer of the resultant mixture be siphoned off. At almost the same time, the government relents and informs Mason through Hillcrest that the military courier carried a top secret missile guidance mechanism disguised as a tape recorder. Mason realizes that one of the passengers picked up such a device at the crash site. This precipitates the murderers into action and they take over the group. Finding that killing the entire group is not possible, the criminals initially take the survivors with them, but soon abandon all of them except for the stewardess, for whom Mason has developed a romantic attachment, and the father and manager of a passenger who is a boxer. In the process, one of the passengers left behind is killed. The group stumbles on in the arctic blizzard guided by sled dogs. Soon they come across an abandoned sled that contains rocket radiosondes, which they use to guide Hillcrest to them. A chase ensues across the arctic landscape to the shore where a trawler waits for the criminals. But the intervention of the Navy, on information from Hillcrest, frightens off the trawler. The criminals are surrounded and after a bitter hand-to-hand struggle, the secret device and surviving hostages are rescued. The first killer is killed, however the second one is still on the go. Having to have locked himself and the stewardess in a very fast moving glacier, it is not as easy for him anymore. Dr. Mason manages to rescue the stewardess, but the killer is left to die.

It belongs to epistemology, the branch of philosophy that considers the possibility, nature, and means of knowledge. Epistemological infinitism Since Gettier, \\"knowledge\\" is no longer widely accepted as meaning \\"justified true belief\\" only. However, some epistemologists still consider knowledge to have a justification condition. Traditional theories of justification (foundationalism and coherentism) and indeed some philosophers consider an infinite regress not to be a valid justification. In their view, if A is justified by B, B by C, and so forth, then either # The chain must end with a link that requires no independent justification (a foundation), # The chain must come around in a circle in some finite number of steps (the belief may be justified by its coherence), or # Our beliefs must not be justified after all (as is posited by philosophical skeptics). Infinitism, the view, for example, of Peter D. Klein, challenges this consensus, referring back to work of Paul Moser (1984) and John Post (1987). In this view, the evidential ancestry of a justified belief must be infinite and non-repeating, which follows from the conjunction of two principles that Klein sees as having straightforward intuitive appeal: \\"The Principle of Avoiding Circularity\\" and \\"The Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness.\\" The Principle of Avoiding Circularity (PAC) is stated as follows: \\"For all x, if a person, S, has a justification for x, then for all y, if y is in the evidential ancestry of x for S, then x is not in the evidential ancestry of y for S.\\" PAC says that the proposition to be justified cannot be a member of its own evidential ancestry, which is violated by coherence theories of justification. The Principle of Avoiding Arbitrariness (PAA) is stated as follows: \\"For all x, if a person, S, has a justification for x, then there is some reason, r1, available to S for x; and there is some reason, r2, available to S for r1; etc.\\" PAA says that in order to avoid arbitrariness, for any proposition x to be justified for an epistemological agent, there must be some reason r available to the agent; this reason will in turn require the same structure of justification, and so on ad infinitum. Foundationalist theories can only avoid arbitrariness by claiming that some propositions are self-justified. But if a proposition is its own justification (e.g. coherentism), then it is a member of its own evidential ancestry, and the structure of justification is circular. In this view, the conjunction of both PAC and PAA leaves infinitism as the only alternative to skepticism. The Availability of Reasons: Klein also relies on the notion of \\"availability\\". In other words, a reason must be available to the subject in order for it to be a candidate for justification. There are two conditions that need to be satisfied in order for a reason to be available: objectively and subjectively. An objectively available reason is stated as follows: \\"a belief, r, is objectively available to S as a reason for p if (1) r has some sufficiently high probability and the conditional probability of p given r is sufficiently high; or (2) an impartial, informed observer would accept r as a reason for p; or (3) r would be accepted in the long run by an appropriately defined set of people; or (4) r is evident for S and r makes p evident for S; or (5) r accords with S's deepest epistemic commitments; or (6) r meets the appropriate conversational presuppositions; or (7) an intellectually virtuous person would advance r as a reason for p.\\" Any of these conditions are sufficient to describe objectively available reasons and are compatible with infinitism. Klein concedes that, ultimately, the proper characterization of objectively available need be a member of this list, but, for the scope of Klein's defense of infinitism, he need not provide a fully developed account of objectively available reasons. Objective availability could be best understood, at least as a working definition, as an existing, truth-apt reason not dependent on the subject. A subjectively available reason is stated as follows: \\"S must be able to call on r.\\" (Subjectively available is comparatively straightforward compared to objectively available.) The subject must be able to evoke the reason in their own mind and use the reason in the process of justification. In essence, the reason must be \\"properly hooked up with S's own beliefs\\" in order to be subjectively available. A reason that is both objectively and subjectively available to a subject is a candidate for justification according to infinitism (or, at least for Klein). Objection to Infinitism: Klein addresses an objection to infinitism. The finite mind objection (attributed to John Williams): The human mind is finite and has a limited capacity. \\"It is impossible to consciously believe an infinite number of propositions (because to believe something takes some time) and it is impossible to \\"unconsciously believe\\"...an infinite number of propositions because the candidate beliefs are such that some of them \\"defeat human understanding.\\" It is simply an impossibility that a subject has an infinite chain of reasons which justify their beliefs because the human mind is finite. Klein concedes that the human mind is finite and cannot contain an infinite number of reasons, but the infinitist, according to Klein, is not committed to a subject actually possessing infinite reasons. \\"The infinitist is not claiming that in any finite period of time...we can consciously entertain an infinite number of thoughts. It is rather that there are an infinite number of propositions such that each one of them would be consciously thought were the appropriate circumstances to arise.\\" So, an infinite chain of reasons need not be present in the mind in order for a belief to be justified rather it must merely be possible to provide an infinite chain of reasons. There will always be another reason to justify the preceding reason if the subject felt compelled to make the inquiry and had subjective access to that reason.

The band originally consisted of lead singer and guitarist Chris Tait, bassist Brad Hopkins, keyboardist Tad Winklarz and drummer Derrick Murphy. History Formed in Newcastle, Ontario, Hopkins and Tait were paired with Terry Miller and Stani Veselinovic in 1982 as \\"The Casualties\\". The band briefly changed its name to \\"The Reactors\\" and then to \\"New Addition\\" in 1984, and finally settled on the name Chalk Circle (taken from Bertolt Brecht's play The Caucasian Chalk Circle). The band recorded a demo single \\"The World\\" (b/w \\"Black Pit\\") on cassette and played the Toronto area, subsequently winning the CASBY Award for Most Promising Non-Recording Group in 1985. After signing to Duke Street Records in Toronto, their 1986 debut release was a six-song EP called The Great Lake. Produced by Chris Wardman, it was recorded at Manta Sound in Toronto and Quest Recording Studio in Oshawa. The lead single \\"April Fool\\" became a Top 10 single in Canada, along with another single \\"Me, Myself and I\\". The band produced videos for both tracks which were regularly featured on MuchMusic, and the EP went on to become Duke Street's biggest seller at that time. Their second release was a full-length album entitled Mending Wall released in 1987, with the inspiration for the title coming from Robert Frost's famous poem. Recorded entirely on digital equipment, the crisp sounding album featured another Top 10 Canadian single \\"This Mourning\\", a blistering commentary about nuclear politics in the 'ray gun' (Reagan) era of the late 1980s. The album would later be reissued with a cover version of T-Rex's \\"20th Century Boy\\", which also became a Top 10 Canadian single. The band's final album was 1989's As the Crow Flies, which featured two singles, \\"Sons and Daughters\\" and \\"Together\\". Citing 'creative differences', the band broke up in 1990, and Tait formed the indie band Big Faith. In 2006, Universal Music Group released a Chalk Circle greatest hits compilation as part of its 20th Century Masters series. The release prompted the band to reconvene after 15 years and in February of that year, they began rehearsals at the Cherry Beach rehearsal studios in Toronto in anticipation of possible reunion shows.

The village of Honley borders to the immediate north of the village and Holmfirth lies to the south. Brockholes is within the Postal district of Holmfirth. Community According to the 2001 census, Brockholes had a resident population of 1,861 in 764 households.Kirklees MBC Website Ward Census 2003 Central to the village is a small green set back from the A616 behind terraced housing, and overlooked by a church, a chapel and the village hall, formerly the village school. The village hall on Brockholes Lane was built in 1837 and is a Grade II listed building. Further Grade II structures are the Gothic Revival St George's Church of England parish church, built in 1861, the 17th- or early 18th-century Bank End farmhouse and barn on Bank End Knoll at the south-east of the village, and a late 18th- to early 19th-century single-span bridge over the River Holme on Smithy Place Lane. A more modern primary school, Brockholes C of E Junior and Infants School for 4 to 11 year olds, is on Brockholes Lane, south from the village Railway station. The station has a direct link between Huddersfield and Sheffield on the Penistone Line. Brockholes contains two public houses, The Rock Inn and the Travellers Rest, a range of village shops, and a post office. The A616 route between Huddersfield and Penistone passes directly through the village and the A628 Woodhead Road passes down the valley on its westward side. Economy Brockholes is a semi-rural area, mostly consisting of farms with a large housing area, some of which has been built on the former premises of Rock Mills, which was only one of several large textile mills. There was also a spinning works, shoddy mill, and a textile machinery engineering works, though now only the latter still exists. A number of larger businesses were established in the industrial units of the old Rock Mill site, including a tyre fitting and repair company, an electrical wholesalers, a steel fabrication company, and a car registration plate business. More recently the local petrol station was bought out by a national chain and refurbished to include a mini supermarket. Brook (Electric) Motors, founded in 1904 by Ernest Brook by its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of £4,500,000. By 1954 Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and had just opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley along with their site in Honley which sits firmly between the road to Holmfirth and the road to Brockholes. Brook Motors was one of the more enlightened employers in Huddersfield. Ernest Brook himself installed a profit-sharing scheme, and to mark the 1954 jubilee celebrations a gratuity, or independent pension, scheme was introduced. Management insisted on clean, well-lit, hygienic premises with the most up-to-date machinery. At its height, Brook Motors was producing more than 70% of the world's electric motors. It went through numerous mergers, though the name still survives in the 2010 company, Invensys Brook Crompton. Production ceased in Huddersfield in 2000 and was moved to Poland. The Honley factory has now closed and the buildings have been divided into smaller units. Other former businesses include Ben Shaws, a soft drinks manufacturers, the old K&M; Candle factory, taken over by shoe polish manufacturer Kiwi, and eventually closed, and Norton Scientific Instruments.

Early editions were written and illustrated by Robert Baden-Powell with later editions being extensively rewritten by others. The book has a theme based on Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book jungle setting and characters. Origins In 1914, The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom had Percy Everett prepare a program for boys who were too young to be Boy Scouts (at about 11 years old). An outline of his \\"Junior Scouts\\" program was published in the Headquarters Gazette in 1914. However, Baden-Powell wanted something quite different from a watered down Boy Scout program and recognized that too close an association between the junior program and the Boy Scouts would detract from both. Baden-Powell wanted a junior scheme with distinct name, uniform and other identity and program. In 1916, Baden-Powell published his own outlines for such a scheme, it was to be called Wolf Cubs. Baden-Powell retained elements of Everett's plan but gave it a theme by basing it on Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book, which had been published in 1894 and was an established favourite with children. The Wolf Cubs scheme was given a publicity launch at The Boy Scouts Association's Imperial Headquarters in Buckingham Palace Road, Westminster, on Saturday 24 June 1916. Baden-Powell wrote a book for the scheme, The Wolf Cub's Handbook, which was published in December 1916. The book included a précis of the Mowgli stories from the Jungle Book, and ceremonies and games based on them. Woven into this were instructional passages on health, fitness, camping, observation, knotting, semaphore, first aid, knitting and \\"being useful at home\\". The chapters are called \\"bites\\" because \\"this book is a meal offered by an old Wolf to the young Cubs\\".The Wolf Cub's Handbook, Lord Baden-Powell of Gilwell, Arthur C. Pearson, 1916 (pp.2-5) The first edition did not contain details of badges or tests. In late 1916, Baden-Powell met Vera Barclay, a young Scouter from Hertfordshire who had written in the Headquarters Gazette about female leadership in the Scout Movement during wartime. Barclay accepted the offer of the post of Wolf Cub Secretary at The Boy Scouts Association Headquarters. Barclay and Baden-Powell devised the details of the Wolf Cub training program, badges and tests which were included in the second edition.Moynihan, Paul (editor) 2006, An Official History of Scouting, Hamlyn, (p. 56) (pp. 2-4) Baden-Powell and Kipling Baden-Powell's illustration in The Wolf Cub's Handbook (1916) showing how a Wolf Cub's squatting posture imitates a wolf at the Grand Howl, a ceremony based on The Jungle Book. Baden- Powell sent Kipling the proofs of the new book asking for permission to use The Jungle Book material on 28 July 1916, after the work had been sent to the publishers. Kipling returned them in agreement without making any revisions.Baden-Powell, Tim Jeal, Century Hutchinson Ltd 1989 (p.500) Kipling and Baden-Powell had first met in India in the 1880s. Kipling would eventually be given the honorary title of Commissioner of Wolf Cubs Legacy The Wolf Cub's Handbook was adopted as The Boy Scouts Association's official handbook for its Wolf Cubs program. Translations were made into a number of languages. The Boy Scouts of America obtained the rights for the book in the United States and published their own edition in 1918, although it did not officially adopt and operate a Cub Scouts program until 1930 under a modified program.Scouting, Boy Scouts of America, March / April 1998 (p.13) The Wolf Cub's Handbook, in various editions, remained The Boy Scouts Association's official handbook for Wolf Cubs until The Chief Scouts' Advance Party Report of 1966 recommended that less emphasis be placed on the Jungle Book theme and renamed its Wolf Cubs program as Cubs.The Advance Party Report, The Boy Scouts' Association 1966 (p.18) See also *Scouting for Boys *The Jungle Book and Scouting *Grand Howl References Category:Scouting Category:Children's non-fiction books Category:1916 children's books Category:British children's books ","title":"The Wolf Cub's Handbook"},{"id":"4845326","text":"Don (also known as Off-Side) is a Dutch 2006 film, directed by Arend Steenbergen. Plot The film is about bullying (with death threats and assaults causing injuries), friendship, and soccer. Don (Clemens Levert), a 12-year-old boy, is the main character. Don's best friend at his new school is Milos (Marius Gottlieb). Milos boasts about his big brother who supposedly protects him and is a sportsman. However, this brother is already missing several years after the war in former Yugoslavia, and he is probably dead. Don confronts him with his lies and false hope. Initially this shocks Milos. Henri (Samir Veen) is the worst bully. Don gains respect by being good at football. He organizes a football team. Several former bullies become friends. Don even invites his worst enemy, Henri, to join, because he plays well. On and off Henri is in the team; when he is, he is team leader, when not, Don is. Milos is so afraid of the ball that he seems to be of no use for the team. However, he can run fast, and is assigned the task to stay near one strong opponent, making him ineffective. Don gets little support from his parents: when he comes home beaten up, he is blamed for fighting. When this happens a second time, they are about to send him to a boarding school in England. However, the whole class except Henri comes, led by Milos, to the house, and asks the parents to allow Don to stay. After Don says also that he wants to stay, the parents give in. At the final of the competition they win by unfair tactics such as kicking their opponents. Henri refuses to shake hands with Don. However, he does one positive thing: he makes good for destroying Milos' football by asking the judge to give them the ball, and, after he gets it, giving it to Milos.

The work lasts about 16 minutes, and is written for an orchestra comprising three flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), two oboes, English horn, E-flat clarinet, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, tenor drum), and strings. Overview Subtitled \\"Three Pieces for Orchestra After William Billings\\", New England Triptych is basically an expansion of Schuman's 1943 William Billings Overture (premiered by Artur Rodziński and the New York Philharmonic in 1944 but never published, and since withdrawn by the composer). New England Triptych was written in 1956The perusal score gives the completion date as June 12, 1956. and premiered on October 28 of that year by the Orchestra of the University of Miami under the direction of Andre Kostelanetz, who had commissioned it. Schuman prefaced his score with this note (and reprinted the pertinent texts for each hymn): The first movement, \\"Be Glad then, America\\", is built on these lines from Billings' text: After a short introduction by solo timpani, the strings develop music that suggests the \\"Halleluyah\\" of the end. Trombones and trumpets start the main section in a varied setting of the words \\"Be Glad then, America, Shout and Rejoice.\\" The solo timpani returns, leading to a fugal section based on the words \\"And Ye Shall Be Satisfied.\\" The music gains momentum as combined themes lead to a climax, followed by a free adaptation of Billings' \\"Halleluyah\\" music and a final reference to the \\"Shout and Rejoice\\" music. The second movement, \\"When Jesus Wept\\", begins with a solo by bassoon and soon the bassoon is accompanied by oboe. \\"When Jesus Wept\\" is a round and uses Billings' music in its original form. . The third movement, \\"Chester\\", is perhaps Billings' best known tune. Originally a church hymn, it was adopted by the Continental Army as a marching song. The orchestral piece derives both from the spirit of the hymn and the marching song: New England Triptych has become one of the works most indelibly associated with William Schuman. It also exists in an arrangement by the composer for concert band although the \\"Chester\\" movement was revised and lengthened. Recordings Antal Doráti recorded New England Tripych for London Records (OS 26442) with the National Symphony Washington DC on 23-26 & 30 April 1975 and it was released in December 1976 on LP, in the US only.

History The station opened on 13 July 1880 as Aintree Racecourse for racedays at Aintree Racecourse. It was renamed Aintree on the opening of the Southport & Cheshire Lines Extension Railway on 1 September 1884. In 1950 it was renamed once more becoming Aintree Central. The line was opened by the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), in direct competition with the L&Y;'s Liverpool Exchange to Southport Chapel Street service. However, it was never as successful because the CLC's route was much longer than that of the L&Y;, serving areas within South Liverpool and along to Hunts Cross, before going north again up to Aintree. On 7 January 1952 the Liverpool Central to Southport Lord Street service ended, leaving Aintree Central as the terminus for all trains from Liverpool. The station finally closed to passengers on 7 November 1960 and then to race traffic in March 1963. It finally closed on 7 December 1964 with the withdrawal of freight traffic (except for private sidings). The official day of a closure is given as the Monday following the date of the last train to run. As this is almost always a Saturday, if 7 January 1952 (Monday) is given as the date of closure, this means the last day of service was Saturday, 5 January 1952. This can be shown by last day tickets bearing the 5 January date Today, no evidence of the station's existence remains, as the site is buried under an industrial estate, located off Park Lane.

The company was named after Burlington, New Jersey, where the men all resided.  History  The Burlington Company included William Franklin, the last Colonial Governor of New Jersey (1763-1776). The company purchased various mortgages of George Croghan between 1768 and 1770. The mortgages, issued to William Franklin and assigned by him to the company, included one for 40,000 acres (160 km²) of Croghan's Otsego County, New York, purchase. Franklin was an attorney and a British Loyalist, as well as the son of Benjamin Franklin. In addition to making personal loans to Croghan, Franklin purchased a 50% stock interest in the Burlington Company in 1772. In 1773, the remaining original shareholders sold their stock and rights, including Franklin's mortgages, to Andrew Craig (merchant) and William Cooper. Cooper was a merchant in Burlington. Cooper and Craig instituted sheriff's sale proceedings under a judgment of 1773, neglecting to inform Franklin. After that, Craig and Cooper purchased the Otsego tract for $2,700 by questionable means. Efforts of Franklin and Croghan's heirs to contest title proved fruitless. Cooper later founded Cooperstown and Burlington, New York on this tract of land after the American Revolutionary War. Among his children was James Fenimore Cooper, who later became a noted author and set some of his work in this frontier region.

It was run by Lotus at Indianapolis from 1965 to 1967; a total of 8 were built, most for use by Lotus, but several were sold for use by other drivers, including A. J. Foyt and Mario Andretti.  Design  The Lotus 38 was designed by Colin Chapman and Len Terry as Lotus' 1965 entry for the Indianapolis 500. It was an evolution of the previous Lotus 29 and Lotus 34 Indy designs, but this time with a full monocoque tub chassis; it was powered by the same four-cam Ford V8 fuel injected engine as used in the 34, giving out around 500 bhp. In all of them, the engine was mid-mounted, improving the weight distribution and giving it good handling. The 38 was significantly larger than Formula One cars of the time, but was dwarfed by the massive American roadsters. The 38 was specially designed with an \\"offset\\" suspension, with the car body situated asymmetrically between the wheels, offset to the left using suspension arms of unequal length. Although in theory this was better suited for the ovals (which have only left turns), for example by evening out tyre wear between the two sides, in practice the handling was sufficiently idiosyncratic that the concept never caught on widely.  Race results  At the 1965 Indianapolis 500, Clark qualified second with a 4 lap average speed of 160.729 mph with a new one lap record of 160.973 mph. Although Clark and A.J. Foyt had both broken the 160 mph barrier in practice earlier in the month, Clark was the first to do so in official qualifying. Ironically, Foyt grabbed the pole with an average of 161.233 mph in a slightly modified Lotus 34 while also turning in a new one lap record of 161.958 mph. Clark led from the start and although Foyt passed him on the second lap, the Lotus 38 roared past on lap 3 and from then on the only time Clark lost the lead was on lap 65 when he had his first pit stop. Foyt led until his stop on lap 74 and from then on Clark was never headed. The Scotsman led all but 10 laps and won with only four other cars on the lead lap, with the rest of the finishers all at least 2 laps behind. With Parnelli Jones finishing second (also in a modified 34), it was payback for Clark and Lotus losing the race in 1963 when many, including team owner/founder Colin Chapman and journalist/author Brock Yates, felt that Jones' oil spewing front engined roadster should have been black flagged. Lotus returned with the 38 in 1966, though they conceded victory to Graham Hill in a Lola, after some confusion with the scoring due to an erroneous lap chart, and again in 1967 when Clark retired early with a blown engine. After a fair amount of resistance from American teams who generally believed that rear-engine cars were for \\"drivers who like to be pushed around\\", the Lotus 38 had proved that mid-engined cars could make the grade at The Brickyard, and the days of the front-engined roadsters were effectively over (in fact, only 4 of the 33 starters in 1965 were front engine cars). Clark won the 1965 Indianapolis 500 with a then race record average speed of 150.686 mph (242.506 km/h), the first time the Indianapolis 500 had been run at a speed of over 150 mph. The previous record had been set by Foyt in 1964 at an average of 147.350 mph (237.137 km/h). Foyt's win in 1964 in a front engine Watson-Offy roadster was the last time a front engined car would win the Indy 500. Design elements in the 38 were eventually worked into the design of the legendary Lotus 49, and Foyt's early Coyotes (as well as a number of other contemporary Indy cars) were Lotus 38 clones.

From 1963 to 1965 she worked with Dario Fo in Settimo: ruba un po' meno and La colpa è sempre del diavolo, then in 1967 she worked with Luchino Visconti in The Nun of Monza. In 1968, her final theater breakthrough with Orlando furioso by Luca Ronconi. She made her film debut in 1969 with Pupi Avati's Thomas e gli indemoniati. =1970s= Melato in Di che segno sei? (1975) Seventies were the golden decade for Melato; she starred in memorable film roles including the school teacher in Nino Manfredi's commedia all'italiana Between Miracles (1971) and the female leads in Elio Petri's The Working Class Goes to Heaven (1971) and Vittorio De Sica's Lo chiameremo Andrea (We'll Call Him Andrew, 1972). Then Melato received much praise for her role as Giancarlo Giannini's Milanese mistress in The Seduction of Mimi (1972), directed by Lina Wertmüller. This was to be the start of a very successful working relationship between Wertmüller, Melato and Giannini that continued with Love and Anarchy (1973), in which Melato played an anarchist prostitute, and finally with Swept Away by an Unusual Destiny in the Blue Sea of August (1974). Melato's critically acclaimed comedic performance in this film as a spoiled, unsympathetic aristocrat is one of her more internationally known roles. For the remainder of the 1970s, Melato worked with some of Europe's most renowned directors, including Claude Chabrol in Nada (1974), Elio Petri in Todo modo (1976) and Luigi Comencini in Il gatto (1978). She also worked on television; playing the role of Princess Bithiah, in the miniseries Moses the Lawgiver (1974), also released in a theatrical version. =Later years= After attaining international success, Melato starred in several American productions, playing one of her most famous parts as the villainess General Kala in Flash Gordon (1980), and co-starring with Ryan O'Neal in the comedy So Fine (1981). Unable to find real success in the United States and Hollywood, she returned to Italy, and appeared in a number of comedies and dramas. She also reunited with Lina Wertmüller for the filming of Summer Night (1986), but gradually she appeared in fewer films, and more on the stage, notably as the lead in The Miracle Worker. Death Melato died from pancreatic cancer on 11 January 2013 in Rome, Italy at age 71.

They are traditional agriculturalists and temple workers.Sri Lankan Tamil Nationalism: Its Origins and Development in the Nineteenth from A. Jeyaratnam Wilson Kattavarayan as caste deity is observed by the Koviar.  Etymology  The Yalpana Vaipava Malai states that the term Koviyar stems from Kovil, a Tamil term meaning temple. Another view holds that the term is derived from the Tamil words Ko (cow) and Idaiyar, meaning cowherds. Another theory states that they are descended from Sinhala prisoners of war, and that Kovi is a Tamilised form of the Sinhala Govi.Indrapala, K. (1965).

S. Perinbanayagam - The Karmic Theater: Self, Society, and Astrology in Jaffna, p27 History = Early period = They are mentioned in the Thesavalamai law of the Jaffna Peninsula, which was codified by the Dutch under their rule. There they are stated as descendants of the Sri Lankan Vellalar. Intermarriages between the Vellalars and Koviyars were common. Other traditions account that they were Sinhalese captives from the Govigama caste who were settled in Jaffna Kingdom, suggested by their ritual status being equal to that of the Vellalars with whom they share similar traditional occupation with. The Vaiya Padal states that they were one of the castes who came from Tamil country in Southern India and were apparently herdsmen. = Colonial period = The political rise of the Vellalar under Dutch Ceylon, pushed the Koviyar along with the Pallar and Nalavar into slavery through the legalisation of the Thesavalamai law, who were a group initially bound to only serve the state as tenant farmers. They were after the abolishment of slavery considered as domestic servants or Kudimakkal for a section of dominant castes, and had the role as ceremony officiators. = Modern period = After Sri Lanka’s independence from Britain in 1948, Sri Lankan Tamil politics was geared towards a nationalistic cause. Koviyar using their ritual and physical proximity to the educational services upgraded themselves socially and economically. The Policy of standardization imposed by the successive Sri Lankan governments since 1973 had the effect of restricting the number of Tamil students entering state Universities and affected upwardly mobile Koviyar students as much as the dominant class. Hence Koviyar were also involved in many of the Tamil nationalistic agitations that eventually resulted in the formation of many Tamil militant groups. They were prominent in one of them namely TELO that was eventually eclipsed by the LTTE that was also seen as to be associated with Karaiyar caste in Jaffna. The civil war and the Black July pogroms have retarded most of these gains and many have escaped the deprivations by seeking refugee status in India, Europe and North America. They are merging with the host populations and/or the Sri Lankan Tamil diaspora.

Its eastern slopes feed a branch of the Johns Hopkins Glacier, which flows into Glacier Bay. On its western side is a large cirque, shared with Mount Fairweather, Mount Quincy Adams, and Mount Salisbury, which heads the Fairweather Glacier; this flows almost to the Pacific coast at Cape Fairweather. The Lituya Glacier flows from the south side of the mountain into Lituya Bay on the Pacific coast. Though not exceptional in terms of absolute elevation, Lituya Mountain does possess great vertical relief over local terrain. For example, the south side of the mountain drops to the Lituya Glacier in approximately , and the southeast side drops the same distance in just over . Lituya Mountain is not often climbed, partly due to its proximity to the higher and better-known Mount Fairweather, and partly due to difficult access and bad weather in the Fairweather Range.

It was the band's only album recorded for their new label, Giant Records, as well as the only album to be released by the band's 1994 5-piece line-up. Music After 1990's Dark at the End of the Tunnel, frontman Danny Elfman felt he was again \\"starting to get bored\\" with the band's musical direction and that a change was necessary to stay active. In 1994, he decided to reshuffle the band's line-up without a horn section or keyboards and add second guitarist Warren Fitzgerald. Boingo was a dramatic departure from all the band's previous album releases, featuring longer song structures with a mix of acoustic and electric guitars. Orchestral arrangements appear on several tracks, orchestrated and conducted by lead guitarist and arranger, Steve Bartek. Recording Recording for Boingo commenced in February 1993 prior to the change of line-up, but was postponed when Danny Elfman was commissioned to score The Nightmare Before Christmas by Tim Burton. Elfman claimed that much of the earlier recordings were abandoned, although the since-departed members were credited on the final release. The album was the first time the band had improvised some material in the studio, mostly notably \\"Pedestrian Wolves\\" and the long instrumental passage to \\"Change\\". The cover of The Beatles \\"I Am the Walrus\\" was purportedly a jam recorded in one take, simply \\"to use up the rest of the [tape] reel\\", but was included on the album as an afterthought. A number of songs recorded between 1993 and 1994 went unreleased, including \\"Water\\" and \\"Vultures\\". \\"Lost Like This\\" had originally been written and demo-recorded in 1983 for the album Good for Your Soul, before resurfacing live in 1993 with a new arrangement. Release Upon its release, Elfman stated that Boingo was \\"the most challenging, fun, and difficult record we've ever done. It felt like a cold bucket of water splashed in our faces\\", and that he \\"expected\\" long-term fans may be put off by the new sound. Giant Records wanted to heavily promote the album as a relaunch of the band. The songs \\"Hey!\\" and \\"Insanity\\" were released as singles, with an accompanying sinister, stop-motion music video for the latter. Giant also hoped to produce an MTV music video for the single \\"Hey!\\", which never came to fruition. \\"Hey!\\" peaked at #23 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in July 1994.https://www.billboard.com/music/oingo-boingo/chart- history/alternative-songs/song/27368 A limited edition package of the album, designed by Deborah Norcross, was issued in a foldout digipak, packaged with an embossed hardcover booklet containing lyrics and additional photography by Anthony Artiaga and Melodie McDaniel. A special edition was also released in Europehttps://www.discogs.com/Boingo-Boingo/release/1629565 and Australia,https://www.discogs.com/Boingo-Boingo/release/5898142 featuring an additional song, \\"Helpless\\", which had previously only appeared as the B-side to the \\"Insanity\\" CD single.

Background  On the Soča (Isonzo) River, Luigi Cadorna, the Italian Chief of Staff, concentrated three quarters of his troops: 600 battalions (52 divisions) with 5,200 guns.  Battle  The attack was carried forth from a front from Tolmin (in the upper Isonzo valley) to the Adriatic Sea. The Italians crossed the river at several points on temporary bridges, but the main effort was exerted on the Banjšice Plateau, whose capture was to further the offensive and break the Austro-Hungarian lines in two segments, isolating the strongholds of Mount Saint Gabriel and Mount Hermada. After fierce and deadly fightings, the Italian Second Army, led by General Capello, pushed back Boroević's Isonzo Armee, conquering the Bainsizza and Mount Santo. Other positions were taken by the Duke of Aosta's Third Army. However, Mount Saint Gabriel and Mount Hermada turned out to be impregnable, and the offensive wore out. After the battle, the Austro-Hungarians were exhausted, and could not have withstood another attack. So were the Italians, who could not find the resources necessary for another assault, even though it might have been the decisive one. So the final result of the battle was an inconclusive bloodbath. Moreover, the end of the battle left the Italian Second Army (until then the most successful of the Italian Armies) split in two parts across the Soča (Isonzo), a weak point that proved to be decisive in the subsequent Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo. To commemorate the participation of the Royal Bavarian Infantry Lifeguards Regiment, Georg Fürst wrote the March \\"Isonzo-Marsch\\".

Il. 2.625 also called Dolicha (Δολίχα Dolíkhā) or Doliche (Δολίχη Dolíkhē), was a place noted by numerous ancient writers that was either a city on, or an island off, the Ionian Sea coast of Acarnania, Greece. In the Iliad, the Catalogue of Ships says that Meges, son of Phyleus, led 40 ships to Troy from Dulichium and the sacred islands he calls Echinae (the Echinades), which are situated beyond the sea, opposite Elis. Phyleus was the son of Augeas, king of the Epeians in Elis, who emigrated to Dulichium because he had incurred his father's anger. In the Odyssey, however, Dulichium is implied to be part of Odysseus's kingdom, not of Meges's kingdom. In the Odyssey, the island is ruled by king Acastus (Od.14. 335-6) and has the largest contingent of suitors, fifty two in total, who are led by Amphinomus, Penelope's favourite owing to his good nature (Od. 16. 247-8; 394-398)). Disguised as the beggar Aethon of Crete, Odysseus claims that he arrived on Ithaca en route from Thesprotia to Dulichium, where he was to be received by its king. Dulichium is frequently mentioned along with Same, Zacynthus, and Ithaca as one of the islands associated with Odysseus' territorial possessions, and is celebrated for its fertility.Hom. Od. i. 245, ix. 24, xiv. 397, xvi. 123, 247; Hymn. in Apoll. 429; Πολύπυρον, Od. xiv. 335, xvi. 396, xix. 292. Nonetheless, the Odyssey does not explicitly state that Dulichium is a subject state under the rule of Odysseus' Ithacan kingdom. The site of Dulichium gave rise to much dispute in antiquity. Hellanicus supposed that it was the ancient name of Cephalonia; and Andron, that it was one of the cities of Cephalonia, which Pherecydes supposed to be Pale, an opinion supported by Pausanias.Strabo x. p. 456; Paus. vi. 15. § 7. However, Strabo maintains that Dulichium was one of the Echinades, and identifies it with Dolicha (), an island which he describes as situated opposite Oeniadae and the mouth of the Achelous, and distant 100 stadia from the promontory of Araxos in Elis.Strabo, x. p. 458. Dolicha appears to be the same which now bears the synonymous appellation of Makri, derived from its long narrow form.William Martin Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iii. p. 574. Most modern writers have followed Strabo in connecting Dulichium with the Echinades, though it seems impossible to conclusively identify it with any particular island. It is observed by Leake that Petalas, being the largest of the Echinades, and possessing the advantage of two well-sheltered harbours, seems to have the best claim to be considered the ancient Dulichium. It is, indeed, a mere rock, but being separated only by a strait of a few hundred meters from the fertile plains at the mouth of the Achelous and river of Oenia, its natural deficiencies may have been there supplied, and the epithets of grassy and abounding in wheat, which Homer applies to DulichiumHomer, Od. xvi. 396 .——may be referred to that part of its territory. But Leake adds, with justice, that there is no proof in the Iliad or Odyssey that Dulichium, although at the head of an insular confederacy, was itself an island: it may very possibly, therefore, have been a city on the coast of Acarnania, opposite to the Echinades, perhaps at Tragamesti, or more probably at the harbour named Pandeleimona or Platya, which is separated only by a channel of a mile or two from the Echinades. Wilhelm Dörpfeld supported the theory of Hellanicus that Dulichium was the Homeric name of Cephalonia.Map of Homer's Ithaka, Same and Dulichium according to Wilhelm Dörpfeld.

It finds John Travolta and Kirstie Alley reprising their roles as James and Mollie Ubriacco, respectively, and introducing the newly extended family members to it. David Gallagher and Tabitha Lupien portray Mikey and Julie respectively. Unlike the previous films, it does not feature the voiceover talents of Bruce Willis, Roseanne Barr, or Joan Rivers as their interior monologues; rather, Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton provide voiceover roles for their newly acquired dogs, Rocks and Daphne, respectively, and it focuses more on their lives. Lysette Anthony and Olympia Dukakis costar. George Segal and Charles Barkley have cameo roles. Plot A young cross breed puppy is up for sale and we can hear him talking. He sees Mikey passing by him and begs him to take him home. Mikey, however, has to hurry past in tow of his mother, and two harsh looking individuals buy the puppy. He manages to escape them and starts his life as a stray. James is a private air pilot working for Samantha - who we see has a crush on him and is always trying to extend the trips to spend more time with him; something James is very oblivious about. Mollie is looking for a job after getting laid off due to the recession. Mikey tells Santa Claus that he wants a dog for Christmas, James feels the time has come to give him one and tells Samantha about this. One day, though, the dog gets caught by the animal rescue force and taken to a kennel, where several others are kept - presumably also found on the streets. He is about to be put down on the same day that James brings Mikey there to select one. Overjoyed, he bumps into the dog he saw as a puppy, and takes an instant liking to him and decides to take him home. He names the dog Rocks. When James, Mikey, and Rocks get home, they see that Samantha is there and has brought over her dog, Daphne, who is highly trained and she wants James to have her as a present from her. Rocks and Daphne do not get along. Rocks is messy and untrained while Daphne is pedigreed and well trained to be tidy and obedient, though she is also spoiled. However, Daphne bonds with Julie while Rocks does with Mikey. Rocks wears Mollie's patience due to his untrained behavior, leaving her to clean up after his messes. Samantha starts having James fly on long trips to many different cities and keeps him away from his family. Mollie has to job hunt, take care of two kids, and take care of the two dogs. James and Mollie develop tensions over Samantha. Mollie suspects that James is cheating on her, if not she has strong feelings that Samantha has been trying to steal him from her. Even her own mother suspects, that Samantha is doing what she can to part her and James. When she confronts James, he uses her past as leverage to and even admits he doesn't know if Mollie's cut off ties with Albert (Mikey's biological father). He admits he has faith in his wife and wants her the same; to which she agrees but still distrusts Samantha's intentions. After another trip, both have dreams of the other being unfaithful, highlighting their fears. Despite these tensions, however, James and Mollie are clearly still in love with each other and miss each other while they're apart. As Mollie becomes more tired, Daphne realizes that she needs to become more independent. Rocks helps her learn how to go outside by herself and use her sense of smell to track people or things. The two dogs start becoming friends. On Christmas Eve, Samantha sets up a plan to trick James into spending the night with her. She tricks him into coming to her fancy cabin in the woods by saying that she wants to introduce him to a prospective wealthy client. She stalls for time until it is too dangerous for James to leave because a snowstorm outside has gotten too dangerous. James calls Mollie to tell her that he cannot make it home for Christmas. Mollie learns that he is alone with Samantha and becomes devastated that he is going to cheat on her. However, Mollie's mother convinces her to trust her instincts that James loves her and would never do that. Mollie decides to drive through the storm with the kids and the two dogs to \\"bring Christmas to Daddy.\\" Their car gets stuck in the woods due to the severe cold and the storm. They are attacked by wolves, and Rocks scares the wolves off while Mollie and her kids get inside the car. Daphne sets out to find help using the tracking skills that Rocks taught her. Rocks runs out to track down James on his own. He finds Samantha's cabin, and James realizes that Mollie has set out to find him. He confronts Samantha about her lies and intentions and quits his job, then goes with Rocks to track down his family. They are attacked by wolves, and Rocks fights them off while James escapes. Meanwhile, Daphne has found some forest rangers that take Mollie, the kids, and Daphne to safety into their cabin. They worry about James and Rocks. James finds them, and Rocks quickly runs in afterward to show that he survived the encounter with the wolves. The family and dogs are happily reunited and spend Christmas together. Cast Production Unlike the previous films, the children no longer have voiceovers for their inner thoughts, since they are now old enough to talk for themselves. Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton portray the Ubriaccos' dogs. This also marked the film debuts of Tabitha Lupien, and David Gallagher, best known for his later role as Simon Camden on 7th Heaven. George Segal who portrayed Albert, the first film's antagonist and Mikey's biological father, reappears briefly. Charles Barkley makes a cameo appearance as himself. Twink Caplan, who portrayed Mollie's best friend, Rona, in the previous two films, does not appear nor is she mentioned in this one. Elias Koteas, who portrayed Mollie's brother, Stuart, in the second film also does not appear nor is he mentioned in this one. Both Caplan and Koteas declined to return for this one. French singer Jordy performs, along with David Gallagher and Tabitha Lupien, amongst other children, in a special music video for the film, titled It's Christmas, C'est Noel, from the album of Christmas, Potion Magique. Release The film was released in the United Kingdom on May 27, 1994. Reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with 25 reviews, the film has a rare approval rating of 0%meaning no favorable reviews whatsoeverreceiving an average rating of 2.53/10.

Peter Rainer of the Los Angeles Times was also somewhat positive, calling the film \\"borderline pleasant\\" because Travolta and Alley \\"are a marvelous team.\\" Leonard Maltin's film guide gave it two stars out of four, saying \\"The first one was cute, the second one was dreadful; this third entry in the series falls somewhere in between.\\" Box office Look Who's Talking Now was a box office bomb, only earning over $10 million against its $22 million budget, making it the lowest grossing film in the series. In its opening week, the film also face stiff competition for an audience from The Nightmare Before Christmas.

The Improvisation League format has spread to France, Belgium, Switzerland and Italy. Description Although the format has evolved over the years, it has always included humor, improvisation, and certain characteristics inspired by hockey: hockey jerseys, referees, and an audience that surrounds the performance area, which looks like a hockey rink. Teams in the league are made up of six members: three men and three women. A referee chooses at random a topic that the participants must act out. The teams are given 20 seconds for a preparatory \\"caucus\\" to decide how to play the scene. After the scene, the audience votes for the winner by holding up cardboard signs displaying the color of the team they like. Each scene or round is worth one point. The team with the most points at the end of the match wins. A referee can also subtract points from a team's score if members break the improvisational theatre rules. If a team protests a judge's decision, the judge must justify his or her decision. The audience can also boo decisions they don't like. Each round lasts from thirty seconds to twenty minutes. History The Improvisational League was created by Robert Gravel and Yvon Leduc in Montreal in 1977. It became very popular in the 1980s and many cities organized improvisation competitions. In December 1982 the final of the sixth season of the LNI was broadcast by Télé-Québec, which led to even greater popularity. Teams and leagues sprouted up all over Quebec. From then on and until 1988, LNI matches were broadcast on TV by Télé-Québec. During the 1980s, the LNI traveled to face the best improv teams of France, which led to the formation of the Ligue d'improvisation française (French Improvisation League). They also played matches in Belgium and Switzerland, which led to national improvisation leagues being formed in those countries. In 1985, the first Improvisation World Cup brought together teams from Canada, France, Belgium, and Switzerland in Montreal, Quebec.

MacDonald, published in 1957. The plot concerns a lawyer being stalked and tormented by a criminal he helped put in prison. It was filmed twice under the title Cape Fear, once in 1962 and again in 1991. The first film adaptation is more faithful to the novel, with the 1991 adaptation being considerably more brutal and violent. Plot The basic plot of the novel concerns an attorney named Sam Bowden, who caught Max Cady, an illiterate, brutal rapist, in the act. Bowden later testifies against him. The jury finds Cady guilty and Cady is sent to prison for fourteen years, where he develops and nurses an obsessive grudge, fueled with rage and hatred over how Bowden sent him to jail. After Cady is paroled, he begins stalking Bowden's family, not only seeking vengeance, but also envying what Bowden has, particularly eyeing Bowden's innocent teenage daughter. Cady's vendetta slowly escalates from stalking and annoying the family to attempting to kill those he deems close to the family. Cady attempts to kill Bowden's son by shooting him with a high power rifle from far away but fails due to the wind velocity sending the bullet into his son's arm instead. As his wife is leaving the hospital, she nearly dies in a car crash after Cady removes the lug nuts from one of her tires. Bowden sends some thugs to beat Cady hoping to run him off. Unfortunately, the plan fails and Cady manages to beat them instead. However, as the cops respond to the fight, Cady swings his arm into a police officer and gets arrested for assaulting a cop. While this sends him to jail, Bowden realizes he will be back out soon enough. Desperate, Bowden decides to work with the police to set up a trap. If Cady enters Bowden's house, he can be shot for trespassing. The plan is to convince Cady he is out of town. He will hide in a treehouse outside while a police officer named Kersek covertly stands guard in the house ready to shoot Cady, should he show up. Bowden anxiously waits outside in the dead of night with a gun of his own. Then he hears his wife screaming and runs into the house. As he is entering, it's too dark to see clearly but he can see a shadow of Cady running towards him. They collide with a force hard enough to break Bowden's foot. As Cady is fleeing the premises, Bowden angrily shoots his gun in Cady's direction and then makes his way inside. He finds out that Cady began assaulting his wife but was interrupted by Kersek. Unfortunately, Kersek was not fast enough to kill Cady and Cady killed him instead and then left once he realized this whole thing was a setup. Cady killed a cop, so the police begin their search for Cady. As daylight begins, they find a trail of blood in Bowden's backyard. They follow it and find Cady's corpse. It turns out Bowden's frantic shot hit Cady and severed an artery and he bled to death. The Cape Fear River is not featured in the novel, though it is integral in both film adaptations.

He trained several world-class middle and long distance female runners including Wang Junxia and Qu Yunxia, who hold several world records. He and his pupils are also called the Ma family army () for their stunning performance in domestic and international events. Starting as a track coach in a remote rural middle school, he adopted a systematic, allegedly scientific training strategy, which includes encouragement, nutritional tonics using Traditional Chinese medicine and track training balancing stamina and speed. There have been suggestions that he has employed performance-enhancing drugs as part of his training regime. He has strongly denied this, although six of his athletes were among 27 competitors dropped from China's team for the Sydney Olympic games after failing blood tests. As a result, he was dropped as a coach from the Chinese Olympic team. Following this episode, he and his entire team of athletes disappeared for several months, fueling further suspicion. His training regimes were reputed to be extremely rigorous, involving extremely high mileage (in excess of a marathon per day) and run at high altitude. Ma is also controversial for his temper tantrums. He has admitted to physically beating his athletes on occasion. His original squad fired him for many reasons, including the late allocation of sports bonuses. Ma retired as deputy director of the Liaoning Provincial Sports Bureau on December 1, 2004. He is recently interested in fostering world-class mastiffs.  Allegations of doping & IAAF investigation  News Reports surfaced February 2016 of a Chinese journalist who claimed 10 of the country's Olympic champions and world record holders have said they were part of a state- sponsored doping program, in a letter apparently from Wang Junxia, with nine other signatories, that alleged that the athletes had been forced to take drugs. Report initially surfaced via Tencent Sports and Sohu Sports and reported by China Central Television (CCTV) and throughout Chinese state media.

The village is historically located around a creek named Gîrla, which flows into the Dniester.

The Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway is a federally protected system of riverways located in eastern Minnesota and northwestern Wisconsin. It protects of river, including the St. Croix River (on the Wisconsin/Minnesota border), and the Namekagon River (in Wisconsin), as well as adjacent land along the rivers. The St. Croix National Scenic Riverway is one of the original eight National Wild and Scenic Rivers, largely as a result of legislation by senators Walter Mondale of Minnesota and Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin. The largest scenic riverway east of the Mississippi River, it lies within parts of eight counties in Wisconsin: Bayfield, Burnett, Douglas, Pierce, Polk, St. Croix, Sawyer, and Washburn; and three in Minnesota: Chisago, Pine, and Washington.  Activities  The upper St. Croix is a nationally renowned smallmouth bass fishery. Other fish species present in the riverway include walleye, northern pike, sturgeon, muskellunge, and catfish. The Namekagon River upstream of Hayward, Wisconsin is well known for its brown and brook trout fishing. Besides fishing, the riverway is a popular destination for canoeing, boating, camping, tubing, and hunting. Camping is provided at dozens of National Park Service-designated sites, at state parks along the river, and, in certain sections, anywhere users wish to camp. The riverway also includes numerous hiking trails, some of which are designated in winter for cross-country skiing.  Management  The riverway is managed overall by the National Park Service. The riverway headquarters and main visitors center are located in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, with an additional visitors center in Trego, Wisconsin operated during the summer. Large areas along both sides of the river are also managed by state agencies and include state parks and state forests.

It is located in Gawd-i Arabān quarter, near Shāh Chérāgh Mosque. It was built during Qajar dynasty rule of Iran. The mosque includes extensive coloured glass in its facade, and displays other traditional elements such as the Panj Kāse (\\"five concaved\\") design. It is named in popular culture as the 'Pink Mosque',Mosque of Whirling Colours: A Mixture of Architecture and Art in Nasīr al-Mulk Mosque in Shiraz, Iran , Cem Nizamoglu, MuslimHeritage.com due to the usage of a considerable number of pink-colored tiles for its interior design.CNN: Why your next vacation could be in Iran, Frederik Pleitgen – 14 July 2015 History The mosque was built during the Qajar dynasty, and is still in use under protection by the Endowment Foundation of Nasir al Molk. Construction began in 1876 by the order of the late Hassan Ali Nasir al-Molk, one of the lords and aristocrats of Shiraz, the son of Mirza Ali Akbar Qavam- ol-Molk, the ruler of Fars and was completed in 1888. The designers were Mohammad Hasan-e-Memār, an Iranian architect who had also built the noted Eram Garden before the Nasir al-Molk Mosque, Mohammad Hosseini Shirazi, and Mohammad Rezā Kāshi-Sāz-e-Širāzi.“A Mixture of Architecture and Art in Nasir Al-Mulk Mosque in Shiraz, Iran.” Nasir Al-Mulk Mosque, http://nasiralmulk.ir/.  Westernization of the mosque  With the rise of the Qajar dynasty, European culture was becoming more and more popular in Iran. Many elementary and secondary schools were built by Britain, The United States, and France all throughout Iran promoting European ideology and culture.Young, T. Cuyler. The Problem of Westernization in Modern Iran. Middle East Institute, 1948. Naser al-Din Shah Qajar, who ruled Persia from 1848 to 1896, was heavily influenced by European culture. He built Dar ul-Funun College in Tehran, which was founded in 1852 to teach European languages and technical subjects including photography and lithography. With this wave of European and American missionaries, Iran started relying heavily on European products, one of which was colorful ceramics used in Iranian architecture. Although Persia was known for its production of glazed tiles with geometrical shapes and their use in mosques and shrines, mostly seen in the architecture of Isfahan , there was a steep decline in the production of tilework in Iran in 18th century. The Qajar period came with the revival of the production of tilework in parallel with the importation of floral and bright-colored designed tilework from factories in Britain, France, and Germany. Tilework imported from Europe was characterized with having depictions of landscape, European architecture, or beautiful women and were widely used in the interiors of residential houses and palaces in the Qajar period.Gleave, R. Religion and Society in Qajar Iran. RoutledgeCurzon, 2009. Nasir al Molk mosque was built at the peak of the westernization of Iran. We see many depictions of western architecture on tilework displayed on the interior walls of the mosque as well as oddly bright colorful designs defining the mosque uniquely from original Persian architecture seen in the 13th and 14th century. Although the iwan of the mosque is very similar in structure to the original iwans seen in many Persian mosques, such as Shah Mosque (Isfahan), in Nasir al Molk mosque the iwan is designed with bright-colored floral designs rather than turquoise colored geometrical shapes. Floral designs and western architectural depictions on walls of the mosque make up an important undeniable feature of the mosque showing the western influence on Islamic Iran in the 19th century.  Orsi: Persian Stained Glass  Although stained glass is mostly popular in churches nowadays, the earliest discovered was in Syria from the 7th century. We do have evidence of techniques and recipes for obtaining stained glass by the Arabic chemist Jabir ibn Hayyan in his book Kitab al-Durra al-maknuna (The Book of the Hidden Pearl) published in the eighth century CE Al-Hassan, Ahmad Y. “AN EIGHTH CENTURY ARABIC TREATISE ON THE COLOURING OF GLASS: KITĀB AL- DURRA AL-MAKNŪNA (THE BOOK OF THE HIDDEN PEARL) OF JĀBIR IBN ḤAYYĀN (c. 721–c. 815).” Arabic Sciences and Philosophy, vol. 19, no. 1, 2009, pp. 121–156.. Orsi windows are windows made of a mixture of wood and colorful glass in the Safavid and the Qajar dynasties. Orsi differs from stained glass used in many churches and Ottoman mosques which serve as illuminated images rather than a source of light. Light is a major feature in many mosques considering it being a major symbol of God in Islam. This is mentioned in a chapter in Quran: ″Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth″The Qur'an [24:35] Orsi in Nasir al Molk mosque creates a major definitive feature that makes up the colorful spiritual feeling of awe in the visitor when entering. The main purpose of Orsi is creating colorful light on the interior of the building. The mosque has seven wooden doors with colorful Orsi connecting the interior mosque to the courtyard. Orsi windows are characterized for using geometric shapes in their designs due to the prohibition of images and icons in islamic art Faghihi, Parinaz, et al. “Architectural Glass in the 18th to 20th Centuries in Iran .” Proceedings of the 5th GLASSAC, 2017, pp. 43–45..

Geyper, although a Hasbro licensee, used Palitoy's product line as the basis for their outfits. The figure itself was a combination of various Hasbro molds, using talker style torsos (screwed together, rather than a single mold). The first version had the head of the first G.I. Joe figures with flocked hair, beard and no beard, and was available from 1976 to 1979. Later, the Eagle-Eye head mold with fixed eyes was released in Spain only. This was the transitional model and was available from 1978 to 1980, with flocked hair and no beard, and the colour of the skin is lighter than the model of second wave 1980-1982, which was darker and came with both beard and no beard, and a body that didn't have the inscriptions Geyper (made in Spain), which the previous models had. Packaging Here are a few examples of Geyperman packages; one can see from the Radio BackPack comparison that even the logo was inspired directly by Palitoy's \\"Action Man\\". They also included a \\"star\\" scheme similar to Action Man, for mail-in equipment/figure offers. =Closed box= In most cases, closed box packages included a photo of the item in use, but some like the radio, used painted artwork to display the item. =Window box= This type of packaging is very close to that used by both Palitoy and Hasbro, for Action Man and G.I. Joe respectively. The graphics were usually original Hasbro artwork, modified in some instances. This type of packaging was ideal in terms of the child seeing exactly what he would receive. =Uniform box artwork= The outfit box artwork was almost identical to that of Palitoy's line. The following are uniform set graphics, attached to the left side of the box. The box itself was the same format as the sabotage set; black frame, with yellow carding & blister pack to retain items. The back of the box illustrated the range of outfits and accessories offered for sale by Geyper. =Small outfit sets= Geyper also offered outfits in a smaller package, with the items enclosed in a plastic bag inside a closed box. The Cowboy and \\"Indian\\" (Native American) sets are examples of this type. The back of the packages have photo illustrations of the other; Cowboy shows native American, and vice versa. =Accessory cards= Geyper offered budget carded accessory packs containing just a few items to augment one's collection at a reasonable price for children to afford themselves. The back of the card illustrated other items or outfits offered by Geyper. Related history In 1964, Hasbro toy company's first \\"action figure\\" was introduced with the name of G.I. Joe. They were 12\\" tall and represented the four branches of the military: Army, Navy, Air Force & Marines. The toyline was dedicated to one character named G.I. Joe and later on, the line featured vehicles, accessories, talking soldiers and six foreign soldiers. The original 12-inch G.I. Joe was licensed to several countries: *to the Spanish company Geyper appearing as Geyperman in the 70s *to the UK company Palitoy, appearing as Action Man in the 60s *in Germany as Action Team in the 70s *in France as Group Action Joe 1976-81 *in Brazil as Falcon from Estrella in the 70s (and again in the 90s) *in Japan as \\"GIJOE\\" and \\"Combat Man\\" from Takara (Hasbro Licensee) in the 60s *also in Japan from Tsukuda (Palitoy sub-licensee) The nineties Action Man was released by Hasbro International for the European market in uniform packaging, no longer licensed to individual companies.

Stafford Ice Arena is a 1,924-seat indoor arenapart of the Plattsburgh State Fieldhouse. It is commonly known as \\"Cardinal Country.\\" The arena was officially changed to its current namesake in 1987 to honor longtime New York State Senator Ronald. B. Stafford, who retired in 2002 after more than 30 years of public service and support of the College and the North Country. The facility underwent a $2.1 million construction project in Summer 2008 to install 1,517 theatre-style seats and 407 standing-rail positions, move the penalty box and scorer's table opposite the team benches, improve spectators’ navigation throughout the building, expand the pressbox, mount two new light-emitting diode (LED) scoreboards and add hard-wired and wireless Internet connections. The previous year, inefficient light bulbs were replaced with halogen-light fixtures and the walls were painted. The ice surface is 185 feetx85 feet, surrounded by new professional-height, seamless, pro-tempered glass and boards. The arena also boasts a state-of-the-art sound system. Both the Plattsburgh State men's and women's ice hockey programs have renovated locker rooms and fully equipped athletic training facilities easily accessible from the ice. Some of the amenities include individual padded locker stalls, flat-screen TV, video equipment, stereo-sound system and changing rooms. The school record of 4,000 fans (before the renovation) has been reached on 10 occasions. International exhibition matches against teams from Russia and Sweden have been played in front of sellout crowds at the arena. One of the nation's finest facilities for NCAA Division III ice hockey, the Arena has been the site of six NCAA Frozen Four events—three men's and three women's-- and numerous national and conference tournament games. On the women's side, the Plattsburgh State Cardinals set a Division III regular-season attendance record on Feb. 8, 2006 with 1,736 in a 4–1 win over two-time defending national champion Middlebury — that record stood until Jan. 22, 2011; and the 2007 NCAA championship game outdrew its male counterpart by 300. More recently, the women have captured back to back national championships in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons. These wins give the Cardinals a total of four national championships, setting the record for the most titles in Division III women's ice hockey. The women's ice hockey team played its first game in the arena on Nov. 9, 2001, defeating Elmira 2–0. The Cardinals have a 182-17-12 all-time record at home for an eye-popping .891 win percentage. During the 2005–06 season, the Cardinals led NCAA Division III women's ice hockey attendance with 7,645 fans for 17 home dates, or a 449 average. High school and youth hockey games are also played here.

Admoni was born in Jerusalem in Mandatory Palestine. His parents, Eliyahu and Sima Rothbaum, were middle-class Polish Jewish immigrants. Growing up, he studied at the Rehavia gymnasium. In 1946, he enlisted in the Haganah and joined the Third Battalion of the Palmach. He fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War in the SHAI, the Haganah intelligence branch, and later in the military intelligence of the newly created Israel Defense Forces. He was discharged from the army in 1950 with the rank of Lieutenant. He then went to the United States and studied international relations at the University of California, Berkeley, returning to Israel in 1954. There he rejoined the Israeli intelligence community, working his way up the chain of command to be Mossad Director Yitzhak Hofi's deputy. In 1982 the designated director of the Mossad Yekutiel Adam was killed in 1982 Lebanon War and Admoni was chosen to replace him. Shortly after becoming the Mossad Director the Sabra and Shatila massacre occurred. Admoni was criticized by the Kahan Commission for not warning the cabinet before allowing the Gemayel Phalangists into the camps, though no action against him was recommended. During his service as Mossad Director, Admoni watched over the Jonathan Pollard affair, in which it was revealed that Israel (though not the Mossad directly) was spying on the United States. He also endured the revelation of Israeli involvement in the Iran–Contra Affair and the public abduction of Mordechai Vanunu, who had revealed secrets of the Israeli nuclear weapons program to the British press. Admoni retired in 1989. On August 28, 2006 he was appointed by prime minister Ehud Olmert to be chairman of an investigation committee, charged with investigating the actions of the government during the 2006 Lebanon War.Oren, Amir. \\"Kahan Commission criticized Admoni; Olmert made him head of panel\\", Haaretz, August 31, 2006.

Frame analysis looks at images, stereotypes, metaphors, actors, messages, and more. It examines how important these factors are and how and why they are chosen. The concept is generally attributed to the work of Erving Goffman and his 1974 book Frame analysis: An essay on the organization of experience and has been developed in social movement theory, policy studies and elsewhere. Framing theory and frame analysis is a broad theoretical approach that has been used in communication studies, news (Johnson-Cartee, 1995), politics, and social movements among other applications. \\"Framing is the process by which a communication source, such as a news organization, defines and constructs a political issue or public controversy\\" (Nelson, Oxley, & Clawson, 1997, p. 221). It is related to the concept of agenda- setting. Framing influences how people interpret or process information. This can set an agenda. However, frame analysis goes beyond agenda-setting by examining the issues rather than the topics. Frame analysis is usually done in regard to news media. However, framing is inevitable, as everyone does it. It can speed up the process of interpretation as well as writing and presenting the news. People just may not realize they are using frames. When people are aware that they are using framing, there are several techniques that can be used. These may include: metaphor, stories, tradition, slogan, jargon, catchphrase, artifact, contrast or spin. As rhetorical criticism Frame analysis had been proposed as a type of rhetorical analysis for political actors in the 1980s. Political communication researcher Jim A. Kuypers first published his work advancing framing analysis as a rhetorical perspective in 1997. His approach begins inductively by looking for themes that persist across time in a text (for Kuypers, primarily news narratives on an issue or event), and then determining how those themes are framed. Kuypers' work begins with the assumption that frames are powerful rhetorical entities that \\"induce us to filter our perceptions of the world in particular ways, essentially making some aspects of our multi-dimensional reality more noticeable than other aspects. They operate by making some information more salient than other information. ...\\" Jim A. Kuypers, Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action , Lexington Press, 2009 In \\"Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective\\" Kuypers details the differences between framing analysis as rhetorical criticism and as a social scientific endeavor, in particular arguing that framing criticism offers insights unavailable to social scientists. Jim A. Kuypers, \\"Framing Analysis From a Rhetorical Perspective\\", P. D'Angelo and J. A. Kuypers, eds., Doing News Framing Analysis, Routledge, 2010. In his 2009 work, Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action Rhetorical Criticism: Perspectives in Action Kuypers offers a detailed template for doing framing analysis from a rhetorical perspective. According to Kuypers, \\"Framing is a process whereby communicators, consciously or unconsciously, act to construct a point of view that encourages the facts of a given situation to be interpreted by others in a particular manner. Frames operate in four key ways: they define problems, diagnose causes, make moral judgments, and suggest remedies. Frames are often found within a narrative account of an issue or event, and are generally the central organizing idea.\\"Jim A. Kuypers, Bush's War: Media Bias and Justifications for War in a Terrorist Age , Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2006. Kuypers' work is based on the premise that framing is a rhetorical process and as such it is best examined from a rhetorical point of view.  Distinctions within primary frameworks  In his book, Goffman said that people use their primary framework to examine their world. There are also distinctions within primary frameworks. There are natural and social frameworks. Natural frameworks don't apply social forces to situations. They just exist naturally. However, social frameworks do apply social forces to situations. The two are connected because social frameworks stem from natural frameworks. For social movements Framing has been utilized to explain the process of social movements (Snow & Benford, 1988).Snow, David A. and Robert D. Benford (1988). \\"Ideology, Frame Resonance, and Participant Mobilization\\". Pp. 197-217 in Bert Klandermans, Hanspeter Kriesi, and Sidney Tarrow (eds.), From Structure to Action: Social Movement Participation Across Cultures. Greenwich, Conn.: JAI Press. Movements are carriers of beliefs and ideologies. In addition, they are part of the process of constructing meaning for participants and opposers (Snow & Benford, 1988). Mass movements are said to be successful when the frames projected align with the frames of participants to produce resonance between the two parties. This is a process known as frame alignment. Frame alignment—a process to explain social movement theory Snow and Benford (1988) say that frame alignment is an important element in social mobilization or movement. They argue that when individual frames become linked in congruency and complementariness, that \\"frame alignment\\" occurs (p. 198; Snow et al. 1986, p. 464Snow, David A., R. Burke Rochford, Jr., Steven K. Worden, and Robert D. Benford. 1986. \\"Frame Alignment Processes, Micromobilization, and Movement Participation.\\" American Sociological Review 51: 464-481.), producing \\"frame resonance\\", which is key to the process of a group transitioning from one frame to another (although not all framing efforts are successful). The conditions that affect or constrain framing efforts are: * \\"The robustness, completeness, and thoroughness of the framing effort\\". Snow, Rochford, Worden and Benford (1986) identify three core framing tasks and the degree to which these tasks are attended to will determine participant mobilization. The three tasks are: :# diagnostic framing for the identification of a problem and assignment of blame; :# prognostic framing to suggest solutions, strategies, and tactics to a problem; and :# motivational framing that serves as a call to arms or rationale for action. * The relationship between the proposed frame and the larger belief system; centrality – the frame cannot be of low hierarchical significance and salience within the larger belief system. Its range and interrelatedness – if the frame is linked to only one core belief or value that, in itself, is of limited range within the larger belief system, the frame has a high degree of being discounted. * Relevance of the frame to the realities of the participants; a frame must be relevant to participants and inform them. Relevancy can be constrained by empirical credibility or testability, it relates to participant experience, and has narrative fidelity, that is, it fits in with existing cultural myths and narrations. * Cycles of protest (Tarrow 1983a; 1983b); the point at which the frame emerges on the timeline of the current era and existing preoccupations with social change. Framing efforts may be affected by previous frames. Snow and Benford (1986) propose that once proper frames are constructed as described above, large- scale changes in society such as those necessary for social movement can be achieved through frame alignment. For political thought Frame analysis for political thought has been dominated by two popular cognitive scientists: George Lakoff, nurturant parent governance; and Frank Luntz, strict father governance.Chuck Watts, co-founder, Empathy Surplus Project, http://empathysurplus.com/?recruiter_id=2  Content analysis in framing  The deductive frame analysis pre-defines frames and then looks for them in the news to see which stories fit into the definitions. The inductive frame analysis requires that a story is analyzed first. The researcher looks for possible frames that have been loosely defined.  Common frames in the news  * Conflict: conflicts between individual people, groups, institutions, etc. * Economic consequences: looks at the economic consequences of a situation in the news and how it may affect people, groups, institutions, etc. economically * Human interest: adds emotion or a human side to an issue, event, etc. * Morality: applies religious or moral beliefs to a situation * Responsibility: makes someone (individual, group, institution, etc.) responsible for a situation Other examples of frames may include: health severity, thematic and episodic, medical, uncertainty, alarmist. What frames are used depends on the event at hand. Four types of frame alignment There are four types, which include frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension and frame transformation. # Frame bridging is the \\"linkage of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames regarding a particular issue or problem\\" (Snow et al., 1986, p. 467). It involves the linkage of a movement to \\"unmobilized sentiment pools or public opinion preference clusters\\" (p. 467) of people who share similar views or grievances but who lack an organizational base. #Frame amplification refers to \\"the clarification and invigoration of an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem, or set of events\\" (Snow et al., 1986, p. 469). This interpretive frame usually involves the invigorating of values or beliefs. # Frame extensions are a movement's effort to incorporate participants by extending the boundaries of the proposed frame to include or encompass the views, interests, or sentiments of targeted groups. (Snow et al., 1986, p. 469) #Frame transformation is a process required when the proposed frames \\"may not resonate with, and on occasion may even appear antithetical to, conventional lifestyles or rituals and extant interpretive frames\\" (Snow et al., 1986, p. 473). When this happens, new values, new meanings and understandings are required in order to secure participants and support. Goffman (1974, p. 43–44) calls this \\"keying\\" where \\"activities, events, and biographies that are already meaningful from the standpoint of some primary framework transpose in terms of another framework\\" (Snow et al., 1986, p. 474) such that they are seen differently. There are two types of frame transformation: ## Domain-specific transformations such as the attempt to alter the status of groups of people, and ## Global interpretive frame transformation where the scope of change is quite radical as in a change of world views, total conversions of thought, or uprooting of all that is familiar (e.g. moving from communism to market capitalism; religious conversion, etc.). Automated frame analysis Since frame analyses are conducted manually, they require significant effort and time. Recently, some researchers have proposed to automate parts of frame analysis. For example, one approach aims to find instances of biased news coverage in news articles. Felix Hamborg, Anastasia Zhukova and Bela Gipp, Illegal Aliens or Undocumented Immigrants? Towards the Automated Identification of Bias by Word Choice and Labeling in Proceedings of the iConference 2019, 2019. The automated approach imitates frame analysis by using natural language processing and media bias models.

For his services during the war, Kraiss was awarded the 1st and 2nd classes of the Iron Cross, the House Order of Hohenzollern with swords, the Order of the Zähringer Lion Knight Second Class, the Military Merit Order of Württemberg and the Wound Badge in black.Otto von Moser: Die Württemberger im Weltkriege, 2. erweiterte Auflage, Chr. Belser AG, Stuttgart 1928. =Inter-war years= After the war, Kraiss was a company commander in various infantry regiments in the Reichswehr. From 1925 to 1928 he served as an instructor in an infantry school in Dresden. On May 1, 1931, he was promoted to Major and was transferred to the Ministry of the Reichswehr in Berlin, he remained there until the end of 1934. On October 1, 1934, he was promoted to Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant colonel) and commanded a battalion in his native Württemberg. In March 1937 he was promoted to Oberst (Colonel) and was given in October of the same year, command of an infantry regiment in Hamburg.Reichswehrministerium 1925 =World War II= At the outbreak of the Second World War Kraiss commanded a regiment and participated in the Invasion of Poland. Afterward, his unit was relocated back to Germany in preparation for the Invasion of France. From May 1940, the regiment was a part of the 20th Infantry Division during the occupation of the Netherlands and France. He was promoted to Major General on 1 February 1941. In March 1941, he handed command of the regiment to Colonel Erich Jaschke and was briefly transferred into the Führerreserve.Müller-Hillebrand 1969, p. 286 From July 1941 to March 1943 Kraiss was given command of the 168th Infantry Division and participated in Operation Barbarossa.

Explicitly, the projective orthogonal group is the quotient group :PO(V) = O(V)/ZO(V) = O(V)/{±I} where O(V) is the orthogonal group of (V) and ZO(V)={±I} is the subgroup of all orthogonal scalar transformations of V – these consist of the identity and reflection through the origin. These scalars are quotiented out because they act trivially on the projective space and they form the kernel of the action, and the notation \\"Z\\" is because the scalar transformations are the center of the orthogonal group. The projective special orthogonal group, PSO, is defined analogously, as the induced action of the special orthogonal group on the associated projective space. Explicitly: :PSO(V) = SO(V)/ZSO(V) where SO(V) is the special orthogonal group over V and ZSO(V) is the subgroup of orthogonal scalar transformations with unit determinant. Here ZSO is the center of SO, and is trivial in odd dimension, while it equals {±1} in even dimension – this odd/even distinction occurs throughout the structure of the orthogonal groups. By analogy with GL/SL and GO/SO, the projective orthogonal group is also sometimes called the projective general orthogonal group and denoted PGO. Like the orthogonal group, the projective orthogonal group can be defined over any field and with varied quadratic forms, though, as with the ordinary orthogonal group, the main emphasis is on the real positive definite projective orthogonal group; other fields are elaborated in generalizations, below. Except when mentioned otherwise, in the sequel PO and PSO will refer to the real positive definite groups. Like the spin groups and pin groups, which are covers rather than quotients of the (special) orthogonal groups, the projective (special) orthogonal groups are of interest for (projective) geometric analogs of Euclidean geometry, as related Lie groups, and in representation theory. More intrinsically, the (real positive definite) projective orthogonal group PO can be defined as the isometries of real projective space, while PSO can be defined as the orientation-preserving isometries of real projective space (when the space is orientable; otherwise PSO = PO).  Structure  = Odd and even dimensions = right The structure of PO differs significantly between odd and even dimension, fundamentally because in even dimension, reflection through the origin is orientation-preserving, while in odd dimension it is orientation-reversing (-I \\\\in SO(2k) but -I ot\\\\in SO(2k+1)). This is reflected in odd-dimensional real projective space being orientable, while even-dimensional real projective space is nonorientable, and at a more abstract level, the Lie algebras of odd and even dimensional projective orthogonal groups are in two different families: B_k = \\\\mathfrak{so}_{2k+1}, D_k = \\\\mathfrak{so}_{2k}. Thus, O(2k+1) = SO(2k+1) \\\\times \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm I\\\\\\\\},This product is an internal direct sum – a product of subgroups – not just an abstract external direct sum. while O(2k) eq SO(2k) \\\\times \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm I\\\\\\\\} and is instead a non-trivial central extension of PO(2k). Beware that PO(2k+1) is isometries of \\\\mathbf{RP}^{2k} = \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{R}^{2k+1}), while PO(2k) is isometries of \\\\mathbf{RP}^{2k-1} = \\\\mathbf{P}(\\\\mathbf{R}^{2k}) – the odd- dimensional (vector) group is isometries of even-dimensional projective space, while the even-dimensional (vector) group is isometries of odd-dimensional projective space. right In odd dimension, SO(2k+1) \\\\cong PSO(2k+1) = PO(2k+1),The isomorphism/equality distinction in this equation is because the context is the 2-to-1 quotient map O \\\\to PO – PSO(2k+1) and PO(2k+1) are equal subsets of the target (namely, the whole space), hence the equality, while the induced map SO \\\\to PSO is an isomorphism but the two groups are subsets of different spaces, hence the isomorphism rather than an equality. See for an example of this distinction being made. so the group of projective isometries can be identified with the group of rotational isometries. In even dimension, SO(2k) → PSO(2k) and O(2k) → PO(2k) are both 2-to-1 covers, and PSO(2k) < PO(2k) is an index 2 subgroup. = General properties = PSO and PO are centerless, as with PSL and PGL; this is because scalar matrices are not only the center of SO and O, but also the hypercenter (quotient by the center does not always yield a centerless group). PSO is the maximal compact subgroup in the projective special linear group PSL, while PO is maximal compact in the projective general linear group PGL. This is analogous to SO being maximal compact in SL and O being maximal compact in GL.  Representation theory  PO is of basic interest in representation theory: a group homomorphism G → PGL is called a projective representation of G, just as a map G → GL is called a linear representation of G, and just as any linear representation can be reduced to a map G → O (by taking an invariant inner product), any projective representation can be reduced to a map G → PO. See projective linear group: representation theory for further discussion.  Subgroups  Subgroups of the projective orthogonal group correspond to subgroups of the orthogonal group that contain -I (that have central symmetry). As always with a quotient map (by the lattice theorem), there is a Galois connection between subgroups of O and PO, where the adjunction on O (given by taking the image in PO and then the preimage in O) simply adds -I if absent. Of particular interest are discrete subgroups, which can be realized as symmetries of projective polytopes – these correspond to the (discrete) point groups that include central symmetry. Compare with discrete subgroups of the Spin group, particularly the 3-dimensional case of binary polyhedral groups. For example, in 3 dimensions, 4 of the 5 Platonic solids have central symmetry (cube/octahedron, dodecahedron/icosahedron), while the tetrahedron does not – however, the stellated octahedron has central symmetry, though the resulting symmetry group is the same as that of the cube/octahedron.  Topology  PO and PSO, as centerless topological groups, are at the bottom of a sequence of covering groups, whose top are the (simply connected) Pin groups or Spin group, respectively: :Pin±(n) -> O(n) -> PO(n). :Spin(n) -> SO(n) -> PSO(n). These groups are all compact real forms of the same Lie algebra. These are all 2-to-1 covers, except for SO(2k+1) → PSO(2k+1) which is 1-to-1 (an isomorphism). = Homotopy groups = Homotopy groups above \\\\pi_1 do not change under covers, so they agree with those of the orthogonal group. The lower homotopy groups are given as follows. :\\\\pi_0(PSO) \\\\cong 1 :\\\\pi_0\\\\big(PO(2k)\\\\big) \\\\cong \\\\mathbf{Z}/2, \\\\pi_0\\\\big(PO(2k+1)\\\\big) \\\\cong 1. The fundamental group of (centerless) PSO(n) equals the center of (simply connected) Spin(n), which is always true about covering groups: :\\\\pi_1\\\\big(PSO(n)\\\\big) = \\\\pi_1 \\\\big(PO(n)\\\\big) = Z\\\\big(Spin(n)\\\\big). Using the table of centers of Spin groups yields (for k \\\\geq 1): :\\\\pi_1 \\\\big(PSO(4k)\\\\big) = \\\\mathbf{Z}/2 \\\\oplus \\\\mathbf{Z}/2, :\\\\pi_1 \\\\big(PSO(4k+2)\\\\big) = \\\\mathbf{Z}/4, :\\\\pi_1 \\\\big(PSO(2k+1)\\\\big) = \\\\pi_1\\\\big(SO(2k+1)\\\\big) = \\\\mathbf{Z}/2, In low dimensions: :\\\\pi_1 \\\\big(PSO(1)\\\\big) = 1, as the group is trivial. :\\\\pi_1 \\\\big(PSO(2)\\\\big) = \\\\mathbf{Z}, as it is topologically a circle, though note that the preimage of the identity in Spin(2) is \\\\mathbf{Z}/4, as for other 4k+2. = Homology groups = = Bundles = Just as the orthogonal group is the structure group of vector bundles, the projective orthogonal group is the structure group of projective bundles, and the corresponding classifying space is denoted BPO.  Generalizations  As with the orthogonal group, the projective orthogonal group can be generalized in two main ways: changing the field or changing the quadratic form. Other than the real numbers, primary interest is in complex numbers or finite fields, while (over the reals) quadratic forms can also be indefinite forms, and are denoted PO(p,q) by their signature. The complex projective orthogonal group, PO(n,C) should not be confused with the projective unitary group, PU(n): PO preserves a symmetric form, while PU preserves a hermitian form – PU is the symmetries of complex projective space (preserving the Fubini–Study metric). In fields of characteristic 2 there are added complications: quadratic forms and symmetric bilinear forms are no longer equivalent, I = -I, and the determinant needs to be replaced by the Dickson invariant. = Finite fields = The projective orthogonal group over a finite field is used in the construction of a family of finite simple groups of Lie type, namely the Chevalley groups of type Dn. The orthogonal group over a finite field, O(n,q) is not simple, since it has SO as a subgroup and a non- trivial center ({±I}) (hence PO as quotient). These are both fixed by passing to PSO, but PSO itself is not in general simple, and instead one must use a subgroup (which may be of index 1 or 2), defined by the spinor norm (in odd characteristic) or the quasideterminant (in even characteristic).ATLAS, p. xi The quasideterminant can be defined as (-1)^D where D is the Dickson invariant (it is the determinant defined by the Dickson invariant), or in terms of the dimension of the fixed space.

(AL I:37). Obeah is a folk religion and folk magic found among those of African descent in the West Indies. It is derived from West African Igbo sources and has a close North American parallel in African American conjure or hoodoo. A wanga (sometimes spelled oanga or wanger) is a magical charm packet found in the folk magic practices of Haiti, and as such it is connected to the West African religion of Vodun, which in turn derives from the Fon people of what is now Benin. In his Commentaries, Crowley explains: :The obeah is the magick of the Secret Light with special reference to acts; the wanga is the verbal or mental correspondence of the same. [...] The \\"obeah\\" being the acts, and the \\"wanga\\" the words, proper to Magick, the two cover the whole world of external expression. It is possible that Crowley was not referring to literal Jamaica Obeah practices or to actual wanga.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the docklands area was regenerated as an extension of the business hub of Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). By 2008 the area had over 599 enterprises. While growth slowed considerably due to the post-2008 Irish economic downturn, since 2014, property values and development activity has made a recovery. New infrastructure, built in the area in the 21st century, has included the Samuel Beckett Bridge and the LUAS Docklands extension. Venues, including the Bord Gais Energy Theatre, the refurbished 3Arena and the Convention Centre Dublin are also in the area. Grand Canal. Projects =Projects under construction/planned= * On 22 May 2014, it was announced that a fast-track planning process was approved by An Bord Pleanala. 366,000 square metres of office space and 2,600 homes will be developed across 22 hectares of land in the North Lotts (in North Wall) and Grand Canal Dock areas under the Docklands Strategic Development Zone (SDZ) planning scheme. * Dublin Landings =Completed projects= A view of Grand Canal Square in Dublin's regenerated Docklands. The Bord Gais Energy Theatre is on the left and The Marker Hotel in the centre and Hanover Quay on the right. * Spencer Dock: This development was originally planned to include waterside apartments, offices, retail space, a linear park and local amenities for leisure activities, although some of this was scaled back due to the economic recession. It is also the location of the Convention Centre Dublin. * Point Village: A redevelopment beside The Point Depot, it includes a hotel, a shopping centre, 13,000 m² of office space, a 3-story underground car park, and a 12-screen cinema. While the hotel and cinema opened, the bulk of the shopping centre remains empty. A \\"U2 Experience\\" Museum was originally planned for the development but was instead opened as a permanent exhibition in the Little Museum of Dublin on St. Stephen's Green and renamed \\"U2: Made in Dublin\\". * Grand Canal Dock: The Grand Canal Dock (GCD) is a project that transformed the derelict and contaminated 10 ha gas site at the east end of Pearse Street into a 250,000 m2 development of 80,000 m2 offices, 1,200 apartments, 10,000 m2 retail/bars/restaurants together with a 2,200-seat theatre and a (150-bedroom) 5-star hotel.

Before its arrival in Dublin, the wheel had been located beside Belfast's City Hall from October 2007 to April 2010. Following closure in Belfast, it was dismantled and transported to Dublin. It closed due to a lack of demand, and was once again on the move, this time to York in the UK. * Point Village Market: The outdoor weekend market was developed by businessman Harry Crosbie. It featured a large open-air stage with performances from local musicians. The market stalls offered traditional farmers' produce as well as household goods, crafts, antiques, and students' art wares. The Point Village Market was open from May to November 2010. * Point Village on Ice: The 5000 square feet outdoor ice rink was open for a short time in the winter of 2010–2011. It opened again December 2014 – January 2015. =Cancelled projects= * U2 Tower: Also known as Britain Quay Tower, it was intended to be the tallest building on the island of Ireland at an estimated 180m. It was meant to house a recording studio for U2. In October 2008, the project was cancelled because of the economic downturn at the time. Proposals to revive the plan were reported in July 2013, but were subsequently cancelled. * Point Village Watchtower: Point Village was originally intended to house a 120m tower, which would have included apartments, office space, a miniature TV and radio studio, and rooftop bar and restaurant with panoramic views over Dublin Bay. The project was abandoned due to the difficult economic situation faced by the Docklands Authority. * Chocolate Factory Park: While it was reported that the building of the park was \\"underway\\" in 2005, and it was reported in 2006 that the park was being developed, the park was never built. However, in 2014 it was reported that the park would be completed by summer 2015. Currently there is a derelict site notice (within the meaning of the Derelict Sites Act 1990) dated 6 May 2014 posted at the location. Transport A Luas tram at Spencer Dock DART (Dublin Area Rapid Transport) rail service has four local Dockland stations. Connolly Station north of the River Liffey and Tara Street Station south of the River are within five minutes' walk of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Docklands. At peak times, the DART runs every 10 minutes. Pearse Station and Grand Canal Dock Station service the remainder of South Docklands and are adjacent to or within minutes walking distance to some the Docklands largest companies including Google and Accenture. An extension of the Luas, Dublin's tram service, runs from the city centre along Mayor Street right into the heart of northside Docklands. It has Docklands stops at Georges Dock, Mayor Square, Spencer Dock and terminates at the Point adjacent to the 3Arena and the Gibson Hotel. At peak times the Docklands Luas extension runs every four minutes. Iarnród Éireann opened a train station in the area in 2007. The Docklands railway station commenced service on 12 March 2007 and serves the Maynooth commuter rail line (except Drumcondra station) as far as the M3 Parkway. Thirteen new Dublin Bikes stations were opened in the Docklands in 2013–2014, at Custom House Quay, City Quay, Excise Walk, Lime Street, Guild Street, Convention Centre, New Central Bank, The Point, Benson Street, Hanover Quay, Grand Canal Dock, Barrow Street, and South Dock Road. Accommodation Hotels in the Dublin Docklands area, on both sides of the river, include the Gibson Hotel (4 star) close to the 3Arena concert venue, the Spencer Hotel IFSC (4 star) and Hilton Garden Inn (3 star) which are both close to the Convention Centre Dublin. On the south side of the river, there is the Maldron Hotel (4 star) on Cardiff Lane and the Marker Hotel (5 star) on Grand Canal Square both close to the Bord Gais Energy Theatre. Also on this side of the river are the Ferryman Hotel (2 star) above the Ferryman Pub. Docklands Business Forum Members of the steering committee of the Docklands Business Forum The Docklands Business Forum is a business association for the Dublin Docklands and is recognised as the primary business organisation by the Dublin Docklands Area Master Plan 2008. With a membership representing over 35,000 employees, the DBF is a key stakeholder in the Docklands' area.

Overview The HPRD is a result of an international collaborative effort between the Institute of Bioinformatics in Bangalore, India and the Pandey lab at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA. HPRD contains manually curated scientific information pertaining to the biology of most human proteins. Information regarding proteins involved in human diseases is annotated and linked to Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database. The National Center for Biotechnology Information provides link to HPRD through its human protein databases (e.g. Entrez Gene, RefSeq protein pertaining to genes and proteins. This resource depicts information on human protein functions including protein–protein interactions, post-translational modifications, enzyme-substrate relationships and disease associations. Protein annotation information that is catalogued was derived through manual curation using published literature by expert biologists and through bioinformatics analyses of the protein sequence. The protein–protein interaction and subcellular localization data from HPRD have been used to develop a human protein interaction network. Highlights of HPRD as follows: * From 10,000 protein–protein interactions (PPIs) annotated for 3,000 proteins in 2003, HPRD has grown to over 36,500 unique PPIs annotated for 25,000 proteins including 6,360 isoforms by the end of 2007. * More than 50% of molecules annotated in HPRD have at least one PPI and 10% have more than 10 PPIs. * Experiments for PPIs are broadly grouped into three categories namely in vitro, in vivo and yeast two hybrid (Y2H). Sixty percent of PPIs annotated in HPRD are supported by a single experiment whereas 26% of them are found to have two of the three experimental methods annotated. * HPRD contains 18,000 manually curated PTMs data belonging to 26 different types. Phosphorylation is the leading type of modification of protein contributing to 63% of PTM data annotated in HPRD. Glycosylation, proteolytic cleavage and disulfide bridge events are the next leading contributors of PTM data. * HPRD data is available for download in tab delimited and XML file formats. HPRD also integrates data from Human Proteinpedia, a community portal for integrating human protein data. The data from HPRD can be freely accessed and used by academic users while commercial entities are required to obtain a license for use. Human Proteinpedia content is freely available for anyone to download and use. PhosphoMotif Finder PhosphoMotif Finder contains known kinase/phosphatase substrate as well as binding motifs that are curated from the published literature. It reports the PRESENCE of any literature-derived motif in the query sequence. PhosphoMotif Finder does NOT PREDICT any motifs in the query protein sequence using any algorithm or other computational strategies.  Comparison of protein data  There are other databases that deal with human proteome (e.g. BioGRID, BIND, DIP, HPRD, IntAct, MINT, MIPS, PDZBase and Reactome). Each database has its own style of presenting the data. It is a difficult task for most investigators to compare the voluminous data from these databases in order to conclude strengths and weaknesses of each database. Mathivanan and colleagues tried to address this issue while analyzing protein data by asking various questions. This analysis will help biologists to choose among these databases based on their needs.

Composed in 1970, and featuring a strong brass fanfare opening, \\"Heavy Action\\" soon became a well established sporting theme tune, most associated in the United Kingdom as the theme for Superstars and in the United States of America as the theme music for ABC and ESPN's Monday Night Football.Chakerian, Peter. The Browns Fan's Tailgating Guide. Cleveland, Ohio: Gray & Co., 2008, p. 85. Superstars The BBC commissioned Pearson to write the piece for its music library, while he was working as a member of the Top of the Pops orchestra accompanying pop stars on the weekly music TV show. During production of the first series of Superstars in 1973, \\"Heavy Action\\" was chosen as the theme music, owing to its high energy brass fanfare opening and Olympian themes. The show (which aired in its first run from 1973 to 1985 and has been revived regularly since then) has always used the theme tune for all episodes of the show in its various incarnations, including the latest 2012 Olympic Superstars edition. The theme is now synonymous with sport in the United Kingdom, and was used extensively by the BBC during their coverage of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Monday Night Football In 1975 NFL season, ABC, who had developed the original Superstars show in the US, acquired the rights to use \\"Heavy Action\\" as the opening theme music to Monday Night Football, although it would not become the official theme until 1989 NFL season. It was also used as the background music during a halftime segment as Howard Cosell narrated highlights of the previous Sunday's games. In 1989, Edd Kalehoff arranged an entirely new recording of \\"Heavy Action\\" for the final years of Monday Night Football on ABC.\\"APM Music Updates 'Monday Night Football' Theme Music.\\" MixOnline.com. October 18, 2006. Accessed 2012-02-15.

In 2010 NFL season, Cris Velasco, Robert Anthony Navarro, Rod Abernathy, and Joachim Svare were hired by APM to do several arrangements of \\"Heavy Action\\" in various musical styles including rock, hip-hop and holiday for Monday Night Football on ESPN. In 2018 NFL season, ESPN brought back the original Pearson arrangement of \\"Heavy Action\\" as the main theme for Monday Night Football.

It is a dog of large size, of lean but at the same time robust build, of considerably elongated proportions. In its everyday life the hortaya is quiet and balanced. It has a piercing sight, capable of seeing a moving object at a very far distance. In spite of its calm temperament the dog has a very active reaction to running game. Hortaya are excellent, enduring hunting dogs endowed with a good, basic obedience and completely lacking aggression towards humans.  Description  = Appearance = The Hortaya is a sight hound of a large to very large size depending on breed type. The breed has five distinct types, with at least as many subtypes to each main type. The result of this is a broad variability, adapting the breed to the large variety of geography, climate and prey found across the huge expanse of its habitat. All breed standards for Hortaya are performance based, rather than appearance based, but because certain characteristics make for skilled hunting dogs, most Hortaya are very similar in shape and build. The legs are long, the spine flexible, and the chest disproportionately deep in comparison to the waist, in order to accommodate large, powerful lungs. Small ears and a long, narrow skull are typical. Hortaya males range from 26 to 30 inches (65 to 75 cm), females from 24 to 28 inches (61 to 71 cm). The weight depends largely on type and can range from 18 kilograms (Stavropol-type female) up to 35 kilograms (northern-type male). In general, the Hortaya is heavier than it looks. When not hunting, the typical gait of the breed is a fluid, limber and effortless trot. When chasing the prey, Hortaya gallop in fast leaps of great length. The short, dense fur can come in any color, as the only breed standards for the Hortaya are health and skill. Dark-coloured dogs typically have a black nose, while light-coloured dogs typically have a brown nose. Eyes may be any color, and typically have a black or very dark rim. Starting in the 2000s, some Hortaya were exported to parts of Europe and North America (see below), where a breed standard for a new, as-yet unnamed subtype was established. Among these dogs, coat colour and colour combinations are restricted to a few types: white, black, cream of all shades, red, sable and brindle, solid or piebald (with white markings, or white with coloured markings). A black overlay and black mask, grey or red tan markings are normal. Atypical colours and markings, like brown or chocolate, a saddle or dapple pattern, and diluted colors (isabella) with blue or light eyes are not allowed. This subtype is still being defined, and further restrictions may be implemented, but the standard of the original Hortaya remains unchanged. = Temperament = The Hortaya borzaya is of a friendly, but distinctly Asian character. It is never aggressive or fierce towards humans, even though occasionally quite vigilant. Due to the rigorous selection on hunting in a team with its owner, the Hortaya belongs to the trainable sight hounds, showing a good basic obedience and high intelligence. It is very close to wolves in its pack behaviour. Thus it is usually no problem to keep even larger groups of Hortaya together in a kennel; Hortaya integrate easily. As rural people in Eurasia do not at all tolerate dogs which harm their livestock, properly socialized Hortaya do not hunt domestic animals and can easily be taught which animals are off limits to them.  Health  Female Hortaya puppy, 8 weeks old, red with light mask The breed is late in development, very vigorous and long-lived. It is not rare that older dogs, retired from active hunting, start their breeding career at an age of 8 or 9 years in perfect health and without any impairment. Breed-specific illnesses or hereditary diseases, such as hip dysplasia and elbow dysplasia, are so far unknown. The life expectancy of the Hortaya borzaya largely depends on its use. In regions where they are hunted on large prey, especially predators, there may be quite some dogs killed young during the hunt. If you subtract these dangers, 14-15 healthy years as an average is not uncommon. However, great care has to be taken in not over-feeding the Hortaya pup and juvenile. The breed was formed on a meagre, extremely basic and low diet with but rare and small amounts of meat, especially high quality meat. Most of the year Hortaya get little more than the scraps from the table, a gruel of oats, bread soaked in milk and whatever rodents they can hunt for themselves around the house. Only during the spring slaughter/lambing season and the main hunting season do they get more meat: the innards and offals from what they hunt for their masters. As a result, this breed has practically no tolerance for high quality, high protein dog foods and supplements, and especially the young, still growing dogs will suffer irreversible and lethal damage to their bone structure and cartilage when faultily fed.  Use and activity  In its original habitat, the Hortaya borzaya is still purely a hunting sight hound. It is used on all game living in the steppe, especially for hunting hares, foxes, wolves and Saiga antelopes. It is extremely enduring, capable of working from early morning to late evening. Up to 8-10 runs on game in a day (including tracking prey together with the hunter across large distances) is a perfectly feasible workload. Unlike the Whippet or Greyhound, the Hortaya is not a short distance sprinter. Game is usually chased for distances up to on the open steppe, and a Hortaya can repeat such runs after only a short rest. Unlike most sight hounds, the Hortaya does not hunt using sight alone; it often will track game it has lost sight of using its well-developed sense of smell. Female red and white piebald Hortaya borzaya Hortaya hunt singly on smaller game, or as pairs and larger groups on wolves, antelopes and deer. Small game is hunted and killed immediately, larger game is cornered and held in place for the hunter. The Hortaya has a \\"soft mouth\\" like the retriever breeds. After a quick kill, the game must not be rent as native hunters also use the furs. In the CIS hunting sight hounds are regularly tested, judged and graded in so-called \\"hunt trials\\". The first Hortaya have recently been officially exported with full breeding papers to European countries, e.g. Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany (2004), Finland and Switzerland. In 2005, the first Hortaya was also exported to the United States. Some of these dogs participate in racing and coursing, partly out of competition due to the lack of international FCI recognition. Hortaya owned by European owners have shown an aptitude for Agility, and have proven to be excellent trail companions for horseback riders. The first registered litter outside of the Hortaya's historical habitat was born in Europe in 2006. Breeding Four-week-old Hortaya puppies Contrary to the practice of Western breeding and breeders of other dog breeds, the Hortaya is not regarded as an unfinished breed which still needs any amelioration or even formation. The shorthaired sightdog of the southern Eurasian steppes, which today trades under the name of Hortaya borzaya, was bred in this habitat for thousands of years, is a breed as old as the Tazi/Saluki and only marginally younger than the Bakhmul/Afghan Hound. For newcomers it would be unwise to be deceived by the relatively recent standard. Analogous to the Oriental and Asian breeds of thoroughbred horses the original breeders of Hortaya consider it rightfully as firmly consolidated. An improvement into any direction therefore is not part of breeding Hortaya. This is an important and massive difference to the western way of dog breeding and it has far reaching, very positive consequences for the breeding practice. As no changes are striven for the breeding methods used among other breeds to achieve them, like incest, inbreeding or linebreeding, are practically non- existent. These methods are seriously frowned upon among Hortaya breeders. It is extremely rare that ancestors appear twice among the first 4-6 generations of a pedigree. In fact, Hortaya breeders try hard to achieve the farthest possible outcross. This is one important reason why the breed is so healthy in spite of its relatively small population. Another consequence is the application of the breed standard. It does not describe any \\"ideal dog\\" which should be bred for, as it is with other dog breeds. Instead the Hortaya standard is a standard of exclusion: it only and very simply describes the boundaries outside of which a dog would not be considered acceptable. Anything else would be pointless, as it is the active endeavour of Hortaya breeders to preserve the large variety of types and subtypes of the breed, which may seem being totally different breeds to the layman. Additionally, with the Hortaya it is its hunting ability which is the measure of everything, anything else is quite secondary regarding selection. Looking at all this it also becomes clear, why an international acceptance of this breed by the FCI is not regarded as being very desirable by the majority of Hortaya aficionados. The breed's breeding practice, its consolidated state and its truly extreme phenotypical diversity do not really fit into the actual breeding and judging practices of today's FCI or of any other major cynological federation. Any international FCI acceptance which would not result in immediate harm to the breed needs major, important groundwork and decades of preparation. Currently the direct and immediate consequence would be the undesirable separation into show and work lines, and into western and original Hortaya.  History  The Hortaya is an Asian dog breed, which developed over the centuries in the steppes north of the Black Sea, after spreading slowly from the mountains of Afghanistan westwards. Dogs of this type were bred by various peoples of this region, which extends from modern Ukraine and the south of Russia to the westernmost regions of Kazakhstan. Therefore, it is not possible to attribute this breed to a specific people or country. In the east and southeast of its geographical spread it connects to the Oriental rsp. Central Asian sight hounds, while it is considered the link to the western sight hound breeds close to the Polish frontiers. In the year 1951, the USSR laid down the first standard for the breed. Today the Russian Kynological Federation (RKF), the national Russian FCI member association, officially maintains the standard. Currently there exist an estimated 2500-3500 Hortaya borzaya worldwide, with less than a few dozen outside of the boundaries of the CIS. An international recognition by the FCI does not exist so far, however the breed is nationally recognized by all FCI member countries within the CIS and by many other middle European nations. In some of these states the studbook is maintained directly by the national member organisation of the FCI, in others the Hortaya is registered by specialized hunting dog associations. The owners of these dogs are mostly local hunters, who live in remote, often isolated villages in the steppe. Few of them have any interest in shows. For them the Hortaya is a valued co-worker who puts food on the table in winter. In the steppe a good hunting Hortaya can be worth as much as a good riding horse. The Hortaya borzaya belongs to the extremely rare sight hound breeds, which - up to our modern times - has been selected exclusively on its hunting abilities and qualities.

He amassed La Liga totals of 254 matches and ten goals over 15 seasons, representing in the competition Valencia, Mallorca and Levante. Club career =Valencia= Born in Sagunto, Valencian Community, Navarro was a product of local giants Valencia CF's youth ranks. During the course of six seasons he appeared sporadically for the 2002 and 2004 champions of La Liga; in addition, he added a rare goal on 26 February 2004, in a UEFA Cup win over Beşiktaş JK (3–2 home win, achieved in the last minute), as the Che eventually emerged victorious in the tournament. On 6 March 2007, Navarro sparked an on-pitch melee that occurred during a UEFA Champions League tie against Inter Milan. Navarro, who had spent the match on the bench as an unused substitute, ran onto the pitch as the brawl began with an exchange of words and what appeared to be a kick by fellow defender Carlos Marchena at Inter counterpart Nicolás Burdisso.Navarro incident video; at YouTube On the pitch he punched Burdisso in the face, breaking the Argentine's nose, while he was being held back by his teammates,La brutta rissa di Valencia (Ugly brawl at Valencia); La Repubblica then proceeded to run away, chased by opposing players Iván Córdoba, Julio Cruz and Maicon all the way to the tunnel. As the scuffles continued on the field, Navarro sought refuge in the Valencia dressing room. Inter goalkeeper Francesco Toldo entered the Valencia dressing room to confront the Spaniard, while Inter players Esteban Cambiasso and Luís Figo argued with the security personnel that tried to prevent them from entering the Valencia dressing room too. On 7 March 2007, UEFA charged Marchena and Navarro, as well as Burdisso, Córdoba and Maicon, with \\"gross unsporting conduct.\\" Navarro later apologised for his involvement in the incident, stating he was \\"very sorry and ashamed\\" for his actions and also noted he would contact Burdisso to apologise. The following week, after reviewing video evidence of the brawl, UEFA suspended Navarro for seven months from European football (it was later reduced to six months); on the 20th, after several appeals to FIFA to allow the ban to cover both domestic and international games, he had his ban applied to all games, ending with the closure of the 2006–07 campaign. In 2007–08, Navarro spent one year on loan at RCD Mallorca, where he was used as a backup, appearing in 18 games and returning to Valencia in June 2008 only to be immediately loaned again to the Balearic Islands side until the end of the following season, where he now featured prominently – 29 matches – scoring in a 2–3 home loss to Recreativo de Huelva on 7 December 2008. Navarro subsequently returned to Valencia for 2009–10, going on to serve as club captain after replacing longtime incumbent David Albelda, but eventually being stripped of that honour by the same manager, Unai Emery. During the campaign he contributed with two goals in 19 games, all as starter, as the team finished third and qualified to the Champions League. =Later years= In summer 2011, aged 31, Navarro had his first abroad experience, joining compatriots Javier Arizmendi, Joaquín Caparrós (coach) and Víctor Sánchez at Neuchâtel Xamax and penning a 2+1 contract with the Swiss club. He was released in the following transfer window, however. In early February 2012, Navarro returned to his homeland and signed with Levante UD from the top flight, until the end of the season.El Levante ficha a David Navarro (Levante sign David Navarro); Merca Fútbol, 13 February 2012 On 26 July 2016, after suffering relegation, the 36-year-old moved to second tier side AD Alcorcón.David Navarro ficha por la A.D.

The station was the terminus of the metre gauge railway of the Chemins de Fer de Provence rail company which links Nice to Digne-les-Bains in the department of Alpes-de-Haute- Provence. The station was closed in December 1991 when it was replaced by the Gare de Nice CP station. It remained derelict until 2013, when the station building was renovated and converted into a library.  History  Gare du Sud in November 1989 The station was designed by architect Prosper Bobin for the Compagnie des Chemins de fer du Sud de la France and construction lasted from 1890 until June 1892. The station building, set back from the Avenue Malausséna, was designed in an elegant neoclassical style, and built at reasonable cost using new industrial materials. It had a monumental and imposing facade with a central high section flanked by two side pavilions, decorated with ceramic tiles, painted designs and picturesque stonework. Above this was a pitched roof with terracotta tiles, parapets and finials. The interior floor was marble. Behind the station building and contrasting with it was a tall metal train shed, 23 meters wide, 18 meters high and 87 meters long, with a glass roof to cover the platforms for Grasse and Puget-Théniers. The train shed was originally designed by Gustave Eiffel for the Russian and Austro-Hungarian pavilion at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1889), and was added to the station in 1891. Although lines to Digne and Annot were opened in 1911, the line to Meyrargues was closed after World War II leaving only the Nice-Digne service. The Gare du Sud was itself closed in December 1991 by its then operator, the Chemins de Fer de Provence. Terminating services for the line were moved a short distance upline to a small new station, Nice CP. Ownership of the old station was transferred from the state to the city of Nice in 2000 and there were plans to demolish the metal train shed and glass roof, and to dismantle the facade. Following public outcry, the Minister of Culture, Renaud Donnedieu de Vabres blocked the plan in 2004.  Restoration and redevelopment  Nice's derelict Gare du Sud station, 2006. The back of Nice's derelict Gare du Sud station, 2006. The facade of the old station building was listed as a historic monument in 2002 and the train shed was listed in 2005. Although the station had been saved, its future remained uncertain for some time and several projects were proposed. One was for a number of artistic associations which had no proper base to move into the building. Another was the controversial proposal to transfer Nice's town hall to the station site. Plan of the station site Following the failure of the 2000 demolition project, the town asked architect Pierre-Louis Faloci to create a new design which would preserve the entire passenger building as well as the metal train shed. His design proposed the erection above the station of a vast porch roof, a \\"shade\\", to be covered with 2000 square meters of electricity producing solar panels. The proposal also included the construction of a media library and sports complex, as well as the rehabilitation of the School of Fine Arts, and creation of a 1300-space parking lot. The design was approved by the Ministry of Culture on 12 May 2005. The first phase of the project, the internal and external renovation of the station building, took place in 2013. Work was completed by December of that year and the building was re-opened on 4 January 2014. The new Raoul Mille library has been incorporated into the station's former waiting room and the building now houses multimedia rooms, meeting rooms and a climate- controlled storage basement. The second phase of the project involves the restoration of the train shed site. There are plans for a shopping centre, cinema, sports facilities, housing and underground car park, and the return of Gustave Eiffel's listed train shed. The plans were initially opposed by councillor Jean Claude Mari. However, he dropped legal proceedings in November 2014, allowing the city of Nice and the developers to begin work. The underground car park had been completed by the middle of 2016 and it was anticipated at that time that the renovation of the former train shed would be completed by 2017 with other facilities expected to open during the second quarter of 2018. The project won the Pyramide d'or, the highest award of the Fédération des Promoters Immobilisers in 2016.

History Various land uses such as significant clearing of the catchment has resulted in significant salinity, an issue where it soil and water table below becomes salt laden. Troy Creek has suffered significant scalding and vegetation loss as a direct result of salinity. Sections within the catchment have recorded soil salt levels twice that of sea water and over ten times tolerable to native grass and tree species. Local land care volunteers, businesses, and school students have planted thousands of trees in Troy Gully (upstream of Yarrandale Rd.) and Troy Creek to lower the water table.

The disputed territory between the two is controlled by the Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic (Transnistria, PMR). History Following the War of Transnistria, the Joint Control Commission was established on the initiative of Russian president Boris Yeltsin by the signing of a cease-fire agreement on July 21, 1992. It consists of soldiers from the armed forces of Moldova, the PMR and Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, originally with a numerical underrepresentation of the PMR. In 1998, the commission was enlarged by the addition of 10 Ukrainian military observers. Moreover, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe also has a Transnistria-based observation mission and participates in all JCC meetings. The current peacekeeping mechanism is a multi-state mission equipped with an international mandate that began deployment on 29 July 1992. Of the three original sides supplying troops, Russia has traditionally provided the most with Moldova second and the smallest contingent provided by Transnistria. As of 2006, however, both Moldova and the PMR participate with slightly more soldiers than Russia: Moldova currently supplies 403 men to the force, the PMR 411 men and Russia up to 385 men. Mission The Joint Control Commission is charged with ensuring observance of the ceasefire and security arrangements and has generally been successful, as the armed conflict has not at any time re- erupted since 1992. The demilitarized buffer zone, known locally as the Dniester Valley Security Zone, roughly follows the outline of the Dniester river. It is 225 kilometres long and from 1 to 15 kilometres wide. As per the 1992 agreement with Moldova, Russia has a right to keep 2,400 troops in Transnistria. However, as of 2006 the number of Russian troops was just 1,500, with between 349 and 385 of those assigned to JCC at any given time.

During his career the central defender played with success for both Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona, winning several accolades for the latter – 16 in total – and appearing in 367 La Liga games over the course of 17 seasons (34 goals). A Spanish international on more than 30 occasions, Alexanko represented the nation in one World Cup and one European Championship. Club career =Athletic Bilbao= Born in Barakaldo, Biscay, Alexanko joined Athletic Bilbao's youth system in 1972, then served an unassuming loan with Basque neighbours Deportivo Alavés – second division – and returned subsequently. He made his La Liga debut on 12 December 1976, in a 5–2 home win against RCD Español (30 minutes played). An undisputed starter from his second season onwards, Alexanko's highlights at Athletic were winning two runners-up medals, one in the Copa del Rey and one in the UEFA Cup, both in 1977. Among his teammates were veterans José Ángel Iribar and Javier Irureta. =Barcelona / Coaching= In 1980, Alexanko signed for FC Barcelona, paving the way for a number of fellow Basque players including José Mari Bakero, Txiki Begiristain, Ion Andoni Goikoetxea, Julio Salinas and Andoni Zubizarreta. With him as captain they formed the backbone of the legendary Dream Team, which won four consecutive league championships. Among his most memorable moments during his 13 seasons at the Catalan side, Alexanko scored the winning goal as Barcelona beat Real Sociedad 1–0 in the 1988 domestic cup final, also playing about ten minutes in the 1992 European Cup Final. Six years earlier he had his penalty shootout attempt saved by FC Steaua Bucureşti's Helmuth Duckadam, as Barça lost the 1986 edition in Seville.Duckadam inspires Steaua; UEFA.com, 18 April 2006 After retiring as a player in 1993, Alexanko started a coaching career as he managed Romanian sides FC Universitatea Craiova and FC Naţional Bucureşti.

Cutting in line, also known as line/queue jumping, butting, barging, budging, skipping, breaking, ditching, shorting, pushing in, or cutsies, is the act of entering a queue or line at any position other than the end. The act, which may be taboo in some instances, stands in stark contrast to the normal policy of first come, first served that governs most queue areas. Reaction A negative response from the rear of the line is expected when someone has cut in line up ahead. According to one study, a person cutting in line has a 54% chance that others in the line will object. With two people cutting in line, there is a 91.3% chance that someone will object. The proportion of people objecting from anywhere behind the cutter is 73.3%, with the person immediately behind the point of intrusion objecting most frequently. Nevertheless, physical altercation resulting from cutting is rare. It was reported that an 18-year-old National Serviceman in Malaysia was bludgeoned to death after he attempted to jump the queue at a food counter. Another incident occurred in New York City at The Halal Guys food cart, resulting in the death of the man who cut in line. The man who killed him was found not guilty by reason of self-defense. Legislators in the US state of Washington passed a bill that makes cutting in line to catch a ferry illegal. Cutters can be fined $101 and forced to return to the end of the line. Other forms of cutting Cutting is also present on roadways, especially restricted access highways, where traffic queues build up at merge locations. Drivers who bypass traffic by waiting until the last possible moment before merging are sometimes considered to be \\"cutters,\\" and are frequent instigators of road rage. This behavior is not usually illegal in the US, unless the driver crosses a solid white line or uses dangerous merging techniques. In Germany, Belgium and Austria, using the merging lane until the last moment is required by law as doing so is safer because of more uniform speeds of merging cars and reduces the length of backed up cars. (However, it does not affect the speed through the bottleneck.) Sanctioned line cutting 1940s poster promoting safety procedures during civil defense air raid drills. =Amusement parks= In some instances cutting in line is sanctioned by the authority overseeing the queue. For example amusement park operators such as Cedar Fair (Fast Lane), Six Flags (Flash Pass), and Walt Disney (FastPass) have Virtual queue programs whereby a limited number of patrons cut the line for an attraction by arriving at a pre-designated time (sometimes, but not always, associated with a payment for the privilege). Common penalties for cutting the line without this privilege range from being forced to the back of the line to ejection from the park without a refund.Six Flags guests get out of line , About.com =Airports= At airports, it is customary - for the sake of efficiency - to allow pregnant women, adults accompanying small children, the elderly and the physically disabled to board an airplane first, regardless of their seat, class or assignment. However, the priority afforded wheelchair-using passengers has reportedly given rise to a practice in the United States, whereby some passengers who do not normally use a wheelchair request one, to pass through security checks quickly and to be among the first to board an aircraft. At the conclusion of the flight, these passengers walk off the aircraft, instead of waiting for a wheelchair and thus being among the last to disembark. The neologism \\"miracle flight\\" has been coined to describe this behavior, as passengers apparently needing a wheelchair before boarding the aircraft are \\"miraculously\\" able to walk afterwards.

It appears as the second track of their 1966 album A Quick One. This song is claimed to be Entwistle's first composition, and became a staple of live shows. This song, along with \\"My Wife\\", \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"The Quiet One\\", were Entwistle's most popular songs to perform live. \\"The Quiet One\\" was written to replace this song and \\"My Wife\\", which Entwistle had become quite tired of singing. Though this song was popular, it was not released as a single in the US and the UK. In Japan, \\"Boris the Spider\\" was released as the B-side to \\"Whiskey Man\\" in 1967.  Background  \\"Boris the Spider\\" was written after Entwistle had been out drinking with the Rolling Stones' bass guitarist, Bill Wyman. They were making up funny names for animals when Entwistle came up with \\"Boris the Spider\\". The song was written by Entwistle in six minutes and is considered a horror song. The chorus of \\"Boris the Spider\\" was sung in basso profundo by Entwistle, mimicking a popular Spike Milligan character, Throat, from The Goon Show, (which possibly helped give birth to the \\"death growl\\"), with a middle eight of \\"creepy crawly\\" sung in falsetto. These discordant passages and the black comedy of the theme made the song a stage favourite. According to Pete Townshend in his song-by-song review of Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy for Rolling Stone, it was Jimi Hendrix's favourite Who song. To commemorate the launch of the BBC's Radio One in 1967, the Who created a brief jingle for the station featuring Entwistle singing \\"Radio One\\" to the central riff. This recording was eventually released on the 1995 and 2009 reissues of The Who Sell Out (immediately after their cover of \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\"), and at the end of their BBC Sessions disc. They created similar jingles to the tune of \\"My Generation\\" and \\"Happy Jack\\" (available on BBC Sessions and Thirty Years of Maximum R&B;, respectively). Sequel \\"My Size\\", the opening track of Entwistle's 1971 solo album Smash Your Head Against the Wall, is a sequel to \\"Boris the Spider.\\" The closing riff of the song is the same as the one heard throughout \\"Boris the Spider.\\" Regarding this, Entwistle stated: \\"I wrote it as a sequel to Boris the Spider for our manager. Our manager wanted me to put Boris the Spider on my album. So I wrote My Size and I wrote it in a sort of code so it sounds as if it were being sung about a woman. Then I stuck the ending on it as a clue.

The region has only to of annual precipitation. The sparse rainfall feeds seasonal creeks and waterholes.Bye and Linares 273 The term was introduced by American anthropologist Gary Paul Nabhan in 1985, building on prior work by anthropologists A.L. Kroeber and Paul Kirchhoff to identify a \\"true cultural entity\\" for the desert region. Kirchhoff was first in introducing the term 'Arid America', in his 1954 seminal article, writing: \\"I propose for that of the gatherers the name \\"Arid America\\" and \\"Arid American Culture,\\" and for that of the farmers \\"Oasis America\\" and \\"American Oasis Culture\\"\\".Paul Kirchhoff, \\"Gatherers and farmers in the Greater Southwest: a problem in classification\\", in American Anthropologist, 56 (1954) (Special Southwest Issue), pp. 529-550, see map p. 544. Mexican anthropologist Guillermo Bonfil Batalla notes that although the distinction between Aridoamerica and Mesoamerica is \\"useful for understanding the general history of precolonial Mexico,\\" that the boundary between the two should not be conceptualized as \\"a barrier that separated two radically different worlds, but, rather, as a variable limit between climactic regions.\\" The inhabitants of Aridoamerica lived on \\"an unstable and fluctuating frontier\\" and were in \\"constant relations with the civilizations to the south.\\" Subsistence Distribution of tribes called Chichimeca, ca. 1550 The Chichimeca, an umbrella term for several tribes used by the Nahua people, were hunter-gatherers in Aridoamerica grasslands. They gathered magueys, yucca flowers, mesquite beans, chia seeds, and cacti, including the paddles of fruits of nopal cactus. The century plant (Agave americana) is a particularly important resource in the region.Bye and Linares 256 Despite dry conditions, Aridoamerica boasts the greatest diversity of wild and domesticated tepary beans (Phaseolus acutifolius) and is a possible site of their domestication. Maize cultivation reached Aridoamerica by about 2100 BCE.Herr, Sara A. \\"The Latest Research on the Earliest Farmers.\\" Archaeology Southwest Vol. 23, No. 1, Winter 2009, p.1 Archaeologists disagree whether the plant was introduced by Uto-Aztecan migrants from Mesoamerica or spread either northward or southward from other groups by cultural borrowing. In Baja California, fishing and hunting provided food, as did harvesting acorns, nopal, pine nuts, and other native plants. Historically, people of Aridoamerica coppiced willows, that is, tree trunks were cut to a stump to encourage the growth of slender shoots. These willow shoots were woven tightly to produce waterproof, cooking baskets. Fire-heated rocks were plunged into a gruel in the baskets to cook. Deserts basins broken by numerous small mountain ranges. The elevation in the Chihuahuan Desert varies from 1970 to 5500 feet, as there are several smaller mountain ranges contained in the area, namely the San Andres, Doña Anas, and Franklin Mountains. The Chihuahuan is a \\"rain shadow\\" desert, formed between two mountain ranges (the Sierra Madre Occidental on the west and the Sierra Madre Oriental on the east) which block oceanic precipitation from reaching the area. The Chihuahuan Desert is considered the \\"most biologically diverse desert in the Western Hemisphere and one of the most diverse in the world\\", and includes more species of cacti than any other desert in the world. The most prolific plants in this region are agave, yucca and creosote bushes, in addition to the ubiquitous presence of various cacti species. Saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert. When people think of the desert southwest, the landscape of the Sonoran Desert is what mostly comes to mind. The Sonoran Desert makes up the southwestern portion of the Southwest. Rainfall averages between 4–12 inches per year, and the desert's most widely known inhabitant is the saguaro cactus, which is unique to the desert. It is bounded on the northwest by the Mojave Desert, to the north by the Colorado Plateau and to the east by the Arizona Mountains forests and the Chihuahuan Desert. Aside from the trademark saguaro, the desert has the most diverse plant life of any desert in the world, and includes many other species of cacti, including the organ-pipe, senita, prickly pear, barrel, fishhook, hedgehog, cholla, silver dollar, and jojoba. The most northwest portion of Aridoamerica is covered by the Mojave Desert. In terms of topography, the Mojave is very similar to the Great Basin Desert, which lies just to its north. The Mojave gets less than six inches of rain annually, and its elevation ranges from 3000 to 6000 feet above sea level. The most prolific vegetation is the tall Joshua tree, which grow as tall as 40 feet, and are thought to live almost 1000 years. Other major vegetation includes the Parry saltbush and the Mojave sage, both only found in the Mojave, as well as the creosote bush. Wildlife Roadrunner The region has an extremely diverse bird population, with hundreds of species being found in Aridoamerica. In the Chiricahua Mountains alone, in southeastern Arizona, there can be found more than 400 species. Species include Canadian (Branta canadensis) and snow geese, sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), and the roadrunner, the most famous bird in the region. Birds of prey include the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), Cooper's hawk (Accipiter cooperii), the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), Harris's hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), American kestrel (Falco sparverius), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), the gray hawk (Buteo plagiatus), the barn owl (Tyto alba), the western screech owl (Megascops kennicottii), the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), the elf owl (Micrathene whitneyi), and the burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia).

In 1988, according with the new educational legislation, a new university was founded on the base of the Valparaiso Business School (Escuela de Negocios de Valparaiso), an old institution for the professional teaching in business administration founded in 1953 thanks to the contribution of Adolfo Ibáñez Boggiano. The new university would take its name some decades later. In the Chilean higher educational scheme, UAI is a private university accredited in the country by the Comisión Nacional de Acreditación (CNA) and internationally by AACSB and AMBA. The Adolfo Ibañez University is ranked 1° Private University in Chile according to América Economía, and the CSIC (Spanish institution for University research) History The Valparaiso Business School (Escuela de Negocios de Valparaíso), was established in 1953 under the protection of the Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso. It is noted for being the first educational institution in Chile to offer the business administration career, as well as one of pioneers in Latin America. In 1995, the humanistic subjects were introduced into the career to make a little change in the students of a career like Business administration. In the early 1970s, the alliance between the business school and the university was broken, and after a few years of autonomy, a new alliance was signed with the Federico Santa María Technical University, a new association that would remain until the late 1980s. In 1979, it became the first business school to introduce an MBA program in Chile. After the educational reform brought about by the military government, in the last years of the 1980 decade, Adolfo Ibáñez University was founded with the business school like central axis. In 1989 the careers of Laws and Engineering were opened, in 1996 Journalism and Pedagogy and in 2002 Psychology. During 2002 the new Peñalolen Campus was opened in Santiago. In 2006, this organization founded the Adolfo Ibáñez School of Management, settling this school for post-graduate programs in Miami. It is the first Latin-American MBA program, to be certified by the US government. In March 2009, this institution settled the arrangements, so the students of the Master in Finance can easily perform the CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) international exams, and so obtain their certification, due to the needs that the market has applied to the graduated students. The Economist has already exposed this problem, that the educational institutions should pay attention to. In April 2009, it associated with Indian School of Business, for the creation of mutual post- graduate programs, specifically speaking, not only the creation of an international MBA program, but also the exchange of students and teachers between them. The Financial Times establishes this Indian institution in the 15th position among the whole globe, in matters of post-graduate programs. In May 2010, Adolfo Ibañez business School closes a strategic alliance for Dual Degree with UCLA (John E. Anderson School of Management), in which establishes that one fourth of the Global Executive MBA is to be done in Chile, while the rest, in the exterior. Until UCLA had his mind set up, the final competitors in consideration were three; Adolfo Ibañez Business School, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, and the ITAM (Mexican's Institute). This does represent a huge achievement because no Latin American university has a Dual Degree with a Top 10 North American institution. Educational Model Since 2002, in this institution, the plan was to put in use the model that many prestigious universities use abroad. This is why students now have: a major, minors and fundamental subjects. The major is normally engineering, literature, psychology, etc. The minor can be done in quite different fields, such as: drama, music, philosophy, etc. And the fundamental subjects (which are all the same for every career) have been using successfully for more than 9 years now the US college program.. Peñalolén Campus The Peñalolén campus is located at the eastern edge of Santiago, sprawling over nearly in the foothills of San Ramón Hill, in the city’s Peñalolén Municipality. The university buildings occupy nearly and are used mainly by undergraduate students. All classrooms are equipped with audiovisual media resources. There is a computer room for training and personal work, and the campus has network connections throughout. In addition, there are five computer labs for Civil Engineering. The campus has a gym with machines and aerobics rooms, which each enrolled student is able to use via biometric log in. There are also several cafeterias across the campus which can be used by students not just for eating, but also for holding meetings and socializing. There are currently 680 parking spaces available for students. Presidente Errázuriz Campus The Presidente Errázuriz campus in the Las Condes section of northeast Santiago is dedicated mainly to postgraduate programs. It is here that seminar program classes are held. It has two amphitheater-style classrooms with audio equipment. There are also climate-controlled study rooms and work cubicles with computers for students. The offices of the Dean of the Adolfo Ibáñez University Business School and many business department professors are located on this campus. Recreo Campus - Viña del Mar Nestled in a venerable residential neighborhood in Viña del Mar, the Recreo campus includes an inviting group of buildings whose architecture was designed to provide an optimal academic setting, with amphitheater-style classrooms and a central courtyard offering a stunning panorama of Viña del Mar and the Pacific Ocean. One of the focal points of the campus is the house that Adolfo Ibáñez Boggiano built in the 1930s, which is now ringed by the various buildings that make up the present-day campus. Sporting Club Campus It was expected to be operational at the beginning of 2011. This campus was designed to replace the old Recreo Campus because the old building does not suit the actual requirements of the university in Viña del Mar. It was to consist of four structures, pulled up together to constitute the main center of operations in that region..

In a passionate speech in the Parliament here, Prime Minister Noon has warned the US that Pakistan would delink itself from its alliance with the Americans if it is faced with the threat from India. In words that have thrilled the nation for their sheer music, although alarmed many for their content, he said: \\"Our people, if they find their freedom threatened by Bharat, will break all pacts and shake hands with people whom we have made enemies because of others. Let there be no mistake about it.\\" In the recent past there has been a growing criticism in Pakistan of US policy towards India. Since 1956, the American attitude towards Pakistan and India has seemed to be on a reversal. A powerful group within the US administration is suggesting that Pakistan, commonly known as \\"the most allied ally\\" of the US, has now become a demanding ally. India, on the other hand, can be projected as a model democracy in Asia to combat the moral influence of the communist bloc. The repercussions of this change in the American attitude is felt all over the place: India has become more stern in its dealing with Pakistan, while in the Parliament here the alliance with the US has been under-attack for a while.

Political parties are banned. * October 8 – Gen Ayub Khan who took over the country as Chief Martial Law Administrator yesterday, today made his first broadcast from the radio station in Karachi (and is feared to have developed a dislike for its Director Z.A. Bukhari). He has said in his first radio broadcast that the army has entered politics with reluctance. He warns the political leaders, smugglers, black- marketeers and disruptionists. Meanwhile, the Constitution has been declared null and void. * October 27 – Ayub and his Cabinet takes oaths. In a dramatic turn of events late night, President Iskander Mirza resigned, giving over his office to Gen Ayub Khan, who had taken oath as Prime Minister just this morning. Ayub now becomes the country's 2nd President, though without a constitution. He remained Prime Minister for around 13 hours only, thus becoming the shortest-serving Premier in the history of the country so far. The press release declares it a voluntary transfer of power but, behind the curtains, the transfer letter had actually been wrung from the ambitious Mirza on gun point, by the 3 military members of Ayub's cabinet. General Ayub Khan, who was nominated Prime Minister by President Mirza on 24th, has taken the oath today. He has also announced his cabinet: three military officials including Lt General Azam Khan, and eight civilians including a young politician Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. * October 31 Land Reforms Commission appointed with Akhter Husain, Governor of West Pakistan as chairman =November= * November 19 – Maritime Commission appointed * November 23 – law Reform Commission appointed * November 27 – Exiled by the military regime, Iskander Mirza leaves for London =December= * December 2 – Administrative Re- organization Committee appointed * December 8 – Gawadar, formerly a feif of the Sultan of Oman, is handed over to Pakistan * December 30 – Commission on National Education appointed * December – Ayub Khan inaugurates the Korangi Colony outside Karachi for rehabilitation of the refugees from India Last year's census shows that 51% of total output in large scale manufacturing is controlled by only 6% of the business houses in the country. This may be considered a result of the laissez-fair, private sector-led economy that the government has been encouraging since 1947. An unequal rate of growth between the two wings of the country seems to have been an important feature of economic development since the independence: only one-fifth of large-scale manufacturing is located in East Pakistan In a spree of purging the society of unwanted elements, the army regime has shortlisted 1,661 allegedly corrupt officials The military regime has arrested Ahmad Nadeem Qasmi, Sibt-e-Hasan and Faiz Ahmad Faiz, the editors of Lail-o-Nihar, Imroze and Pakistan Times respectively.
