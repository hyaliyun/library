For the lorry ride of a lifetime...\\", Independent On Sunday, 28 November 2004 Venue and Theatre Production History Stan's Cafe was founded by James Yarker and Graeme Rose in 1991 - both Theatre Studies graduates from Lancaster University. The company's unusual name was derived from a real caf√© just off Brick Lane in London. The partnership between Yarker and Rose was from the start supplemented by collaborations with associate artists from a variety of backgrounds. With productions of Memoirs of An Amnesiac and Canute The King - the latter premiered in Moseley Road Swimming Baths - Stan's Cafe established itself as a company of exciting potential. Having rehearsed these early productions in borrowed spaces and a spare room in a rented house in the Balsall Heath district of Birmingham, the company started rehearsing and presenting work at mac (formerly Midlands Arts Centre) once it received its first significant public funding for Bingo In The House of Babel, inspired by theories of artificial intelligence and virtual reality. The company moved its office to the venue in 1997. mac also supported the company by commissioning three shows, namely Voodoo City, a show about urban magic and controlling one's own destiny; Dance Steps, an installation about a love story of two people who meet at mac; and Tuning Out With Radio Z, a three-hour-long improvised show performed in front of a live audience and webcast as a radio show with the audience invited to contribute ideas and text via SMS messages or an online bulletin board. These productions contributed to the company being described as \\"one of the [UK's] most tirelessly inventive theatre companies...breaking the mould of what theatre can and might be.\\" In 1996, Stan's Cafe won a Barclays New Stages award for its two-woman production, Ocean of Storms, about notions of gravity and ohm. It was included on its tour dates in The Royal Court's studio space. In 1998, a funding crisis prompted by the controversial and highly minimalist production Simple Maths led to one of the company's most significant productions, It's Your Film. It could be seen by only one spectator at a time, who was installed in a photo booth, eye-level positioned facing the centre of the small screen. It was commissioned for The Bond, a small independent art gallery and whilst originally planned to be presented for one night only, it went on to become an extremely prolific show touring to 37 cities in 15 countries, including an international premiere at the Theatre Formen Festival in Hannover, Germany in June 2000. The success of It's Your Film led to the company developing a strand of paratheatrical works that will be discussed in the next section. In 2000, Good and True, a comedy that \\"explores how questions produce more queries than answers\\", was commissioned by Birmingham City Council's Forward Festival. This production toured the United Kingdom and remained in the company's repertoire long enough to be shown at the Linbury Studio in the Royal Opera House in 2003. In order to rehearse their ambitious 'rock musical' Lurid and Insane, inspired by an obituary for the Bokassa, the company moved out of mac into a factory unit on New Canal Street above a firm of die stampers. Before its demolition in 2006, this space hosted the devising of Be Proud of Me, a collaboration with photographer Ed Dimsdale built on the language of tourist phrase books - early versions of the company's training day, A City Adventure (which is discussed further in the Education section). Giving other companies access to their space as well as hosting parties and concerts by underground bands kindled the company's ambition to run its own venue. Between 2006 and 2009, the company operated from an office in The Big Peg in Birmingham's jewellery quarter. Whilst here the company devised and toured Home of the Wriggler, a piece inspired by the Longbridge Car Plant and its closure. Described as a \\"lo-fi sci-fi docu-drama\\", this piece was notable for its actors having to power the show's lights and sound through on-stage dynamos. In 2007, the company was commissioned by the Vienna Festival, Warwick Arts Centre, and The Fierce Festival to make a large scale sequel to their intimate production, It's Your Film. The Cleansing of Constance Brown uses a proscenium arch 2m wide to frame the end of a corridor 14m deep with seven doors on each side. This device frames the action powerfully and is inspired by work of Insomniac Theatre, for whom Stan's Cafe members, Amanda Hadingue and Craig Stephens had also worked. This production defied financial logic by touring extensively with a show with a cast of 7 and 2 tonnes of equipment whose audience, for reasons of sightlines, was limited to fifty per performance. It has since been seen in Bucharest, Toronto and Cologne, amongst other international destinations. In 2009, Stan's Cafe moved into a vacant portion of the A E Harris and Co. metal working factory which provided sufficient space to host rehearsals, storage and the company's office. The freedom of having their own venue allowed the company to work outside the normal restrictions associated with having to hire or be booked by established venues. This freedom was used to make The Just Price of Flowers almost spontaneously, written in a little over a week and rehearsed in a similar period. The show used a Brechtian approach to theatre, complete with narrator/singer and placards, to discuss the 1998 financial crisis through the phenomena of Tulipmania in The Netherlands in 2010. This low budget 'austerity production' was promoted almost entirely through social media and was initially presented for just three nights at the company's home venues using set and costumes recycled from The Cleansing of Constance Brown. Success of this initial run led to the production being re-staged, with a largely new cast, as a co-production with Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Stan's Cafe's increasing tendency to make work over an extended period and to place pauses between premiere performances and touring can be seen in The Cardinals which was rehearsed in three blocks across 2010 and 2011 before its premiere at Domaine d'O in Montpellier, France, the venue that co-commissioned the project. A year would elapse before its second run at its other commissioning venue, Warwick Arts Centre. After a further week at The Drum in Plymouth, another year would elapse before the production was re-performed at The Roundhouse in London and Stan's Cafe's own venue in Birmingham in January and February 2013. The Cardinals' religious concerns led to a booking at the Christian Greenbelt Festival in 2012. The flat, almost childlike set of the cardinal's puppet theatre, is reminiscent of the company's very first production Perry Como's Christmas Cracker, in which two incompetent theatrical impresarios attempt to squeeze the Christian nativity story into a pantomime form. In 2013, the company opened its first serious adaptation, an attempt to stage the vast 17th century book The Anatomy of Melancholy by Robert Burton. Para-Theatrical Work The success of It's Your Film described by one critic as \\"the Godfather of one-on-one theatre\\" led Stan's Cafe to be invited to make a range of other para-theatrical projects. In 2000, Birmingham City Council commissioned The Black Maze for its Revolution Festival on 2 and 3 January. This sensory art installation was originally constructed to be installed in galleries, but its popular successes led to its re-installation in the back of a 7.5 ton truck allowing it to visit street festivals across the UK and into Europe. It's an intimate theatre experience that's different for each participant, creating a one of a kind shared experience for those that enter in twos or threes. In 2002, Jubilee Arts commissioned Space Station for the Birmingham - Wolverhampton Metro, which saw three astronauts appear on new platform labelled Earth North Central attempting to catch a train to the planets, a feat made apparently possible through an alteration to the maps onboard all metro trains. To make the piece possible, negotiations with the Department of Transport were needed in order to install the platform and stop the train at an authorized point to allow the astronauts to board at the end of the day. Train conductors had to become semi-official gallery guides as passengers encountered the performance (and the others that were spread out along the metro line between West Bromwich and Wednesbury). In 2003, Radiator commissioned Broadway Hertz, a sound installation that, through placing microphones around the building allowed audience members to re-mix the building's sounds. Of All The People In All The World: Two 20kg bags of rice became the number of people displaced in Darfur. Almost simultaneous with the opening of Broadway Hertz was the opening of Of All The People In All The World at Warwick Arts Centre. In 2002, the company received its first ever revenue funding from Arts Council England, freeing the company from the restriction of always agreeing projects and budgets for subsidy in advance. This freedom allowed the company to spend approximately ¬£700 on a tonne of rice, enough for each person in the UK to be given a grain. The project's simple premise that \\"one grain = one person\\" allowed for human population statistics to be represented as carefully counted/weighed piles of rice sitting on labelled sheets of white paper. The ability of the show to directly and flexibly address human concerns in an engaging and emotionally powerful manner led to the show's rapid success. It remains in the company's repertoire regularly performing around the world, mostly in theatre festivals and in a range of scales from 1 tonne of rice up to vast versions of 104 and 112 tonnes representing the entire world's population at the time of performance. The 104 tonne version for Theatre De Welt, commissioned by Marie Zimmerman, is documented in a book with photographs by Ed Dimsdale and poetry by Alan Hay. It is perhaps the success of Of All the People in All the World that has turned Stan's Cafe into an international festival favourite. The freedom of their own venue allowed Stan's Cafe to pursue apparently whimsical projects. In 2009, 24 Hour Scalextric saw audience and actors racing slot cars around a vast track for 24 hours to coincide with the Le Mans race of that year. The piece was transformed into art by two commentators giving a live webcast description of the entire reach. The company's policy of pressing interesting projects without a close scrutiny of long term viability was again vindicated as schools started to request their own miniature versions of the race in order to promote literacy and mathematics. Also spinning off from the race were the two commentator figures who were later commissioned by East Side Gallery, Fierce Festival and projects who variously requested the commentators webcast commentaries on a football match - whilst only being able to watch an audience watch a match on a big screen, view from a hotel window just overlooking Birmingham's busiest street of nightclubs, the Crab Fair in Egremont, including the World Gurning Championships in 2011. In 2008, mac approached Stan's Cafe for a show to celebrate the arts centre's closure for redevelopment. The subsequent project, Dance Steps, inspired by teach yourself to dance floor mats gave audiences the opportunity to take roles in a mini drama by following vinyl foot, hand and 'object prints' spread around a venue. Between 2008 and 2012, The Steps Series has appeared in 18 venues being re- made for each new setting adapting its narrative according to the architecture and context of its setting. Education Work Since its earliest days, Stan's Cafe has worked in education settings. The first of its large scale devised shows was When In The Future They Look Back At Us, a piece of visual theatre devised with students at the Emmbrook School in Reading. For a while, the company mostly ran workshops to support its touring shows. Then it moved to making videos and stop frame animations, following a commission to make Head to Head with Foxhollies Special School. No Walls Just Doors, a piece of visual theatre with a soundtrack by Brian Duffy, was devised with Stage 2, mac's youth theatre. This piece was followed by an adaptation of Claire Dowie's monologue into a poly-vocal piece for thirteen performers. Theatre shows were also devised with undergraduates at Demontfort University (three), Warwick Arts Centre and Coventry University. The initiation of Arts Council England's Creative Partnerships program led to an increase in the company's education work and its move away from performative traditions. In 2002, Stan's Cafe was tasked to develop a day-long experience that would explore the role of risk- taking in creative learning for teachers from the 26 schools working as part of this initiative. The company devised a Risk Day, where teachers working in pairs were given a series of choices that guided their navigation around and through Birmingham city centre, collecting observations and encounters, to an end point in Digbeth at the Chuck Works (Stan's Cafe base) and then the Custard Factory, where the Creative Partnerships is located. In 2004, School Rulers with Castle Vale School created ten artworks in collaboration with students that addressed those student's concerns around school. The same year, Stan's Caf√© devised Plague Nation, a spin-off from Of All The People In All The World, initially with four schools in Birmingham, Bristol and Nottingham. In each case, a class of 30 or so school students from Year 9 (13‚Äì14 years old) collaborated with their teachers and performers from the company to create an installation out of 989 kg. of rice. This version of the project has been written about in a number of studies of Theatre-In-Education-Practice. In 2009, Space Steps saw The Steps Series transform Beaumpnt Leys School into a space ship. In 2011, Fruit and Veg Cities saw children from Forestdale Primary School create city scape diorama from fruits and exhibit them in the Birmingham's bullring markets. Audio Work Stan's Caf√©'s long term collaboration with musician and studio engineer, Jon Ward, led to the CD titled Pieces for the Radio Volume 1, tracks from which were played on BBC Radio 3's Late Junction as well as at The Big Chill Festival. It was followed by Pieces for the Radio Volume 2: Comfort Hour. The CD was an hour long improvised piece recorded by the cast of Lurid and Insane and produced by Brian Duffy with text by James Yarker. Sections from this were also played on Late Junction. So Bring Me Down, an audio adaptation of Ocean of Storms, was produced by artist/musician Jony Easterby and Brian Duffy. It was commissioned by Andrew Chetty for NOW98, Nottingham's annual performance festival for their radio station, NOWFM, and released on their CD. I See With My Eyes Closed was a collaboration with composer Michael Wolters commissioned by Birmingham Contemporary Music Group (BCMG) which makes the audience privy to the thoughts of two audience members at a classical music conference. The company's second collaboration with Wolters resulted in The Voyage, a 12 long minute opera commissioned by PRS for Music for the Cultural Olympiad, staged at Stan's Cafe's venue. The show used a seating back on wheels to extend the stage from an intimate space to the start to a 30m long running track in the middle and back to the intimate space for the close. The piece was composed for ensemble of one singer, a double bass, and thirteen recorders - two of which play microtonally. This piece was recorded and broadcast by Radio 3 and later staged at the Hayward Gallery as part of the 20x12 Festival. Miscellaneous Projects Stan's Cafe's independence and diversity of interests has allowed it to pursue a wide range of projects, some of which are not easy to classify. Some critics note that Stan's Cafe's projects exemplify \\"the subtle hybridity of recent British postmodern performance.\\" Although the company sees itself as a theatre company and promote itself as such, it has used \\"interdisciplinary sources to produce performances.\\" In 1999, the company undertook a pioneering project of re-staging The Carrier Frequency, Impact Theatre's highly regarded collaboration with novelist Russell Hoban, better known for his dystopian novels such as Ridley Walker, for Birmingham City Council's Towards the Millennium Festival. Using video documentation as the primary 'text', Graeme Miller remastered the original soundtrack he had recorded with Steve Shill, and Russell Hoban supplied his original texts. The re-staging ran for three nights at The Crescent Theatre in Birmingham and was the subject of a conference on 'Archeology, Repertory and Theatre Inheritance' and supplement in Live Art Magazine. This remembering was in part developed with the intervention of the academy. In 2000, Stan's Cafe curated The Future Art Symposia for Birmingham City Council's Forward Festival. It was funded by the National Lottery via the Arts Council England, bringing together a range of artists, curators, and academics from a variety of backgrounds. This series of four symposia discussing the present and future of art themed around 'Art and The New'; 'Art and Society'; 'Art and Technology'; and 'Art and Time.' The speakers were Jonathan Watkins, Heather Maitland, John Wyver, Ansuman Biswas, James Yarker, Michael Van Graan, Claire Smith, Alun Mountford, Sadie Plant, Heidi Reitmaier, Ann Whitehurst, Brian Duffy, Mike Pearson, Christopher Egret, and Claire Russ. Transcripts of the presentations were later published in book form. A City Adventure is a creative orienteering adventure commissioned by Creative Partnerships as a training course for teachers encouraging creative thinking and teaching for creativity. The adventure was successful enough to be repeated more than a dozen times and franchised to theatre companies, Desperate Men in Bristol and Third Angel in Sheffield. Framed was commissioned for the 2002 Croydon International Film Festival. It combined public street performances making a video framed around the venue using members of the public as extras. The video was edited whilst shooting was still underway by Joseph Potts in tandem with Giles Perrin creating a soundtrack. The completed film then formed the basis of a live performance which took the audience from watching a film, to watching real life synching with film and being ushered outside to watch the shooting of the film's final scene. Lighting designer and pyrotechnical Paul Arvidson mocked up a fire in the building. In the winter of 2004, Stan's Cafe created Ho Ho Ho, an on-line guide to illuminate Christmas displays around Birmingham and the Black Country, in collaboration with The Public. Edited by novelist Catherine O'Flynn, this project included photographs of displays, interviews with their creators, reviews, editorial comment, suggested tours and safety advice. Touring Touring has always been at the heart of Stan's Cafe's mission. During its early years, the company initially toured to arts centres across the UK. From 2000 onwards, international touring became increasingly key to the company's success. In more recent years, as opportunities to tour in the UK have drastically reduced, the company has looked to present shows for a week at a time in the studio spaces of larger theatres. The Company From its inception, Stan's Cafe was a partnership open to outside collaborators. In 1995, Graeme Rose left to form The Resurrectionists with composer Richard Chew. In 1997, James Yarker was joined by part-time administrator, Paulette Terry Brien, who left to form The International 3 gallery in Manchester. Craig Stephens, who joined the company as an associate artist in 1997 to devise and perform in Simple Maths, went on to become a full-time employee of the company, devising and performing in all the company's shows as well as leading on numerous education projects. He is the company's Associate Director. Nick Sweeting, founder member of Improbable, joined as part-time advisory producer in 2003, while Charlotte Martin joined as General Manager in 2005. Graeme Rose returned to the company as a performer of It's Your Film in 1999 and performed in numerous productions thereafter as well working for a spell as part-time Education Officer for the company - job sharing with artist, Ana Rutter. Karen Stafford was taken on as Production Manager to cope with high demand for Of All The People In All The World. She left to take up a job as production manager at the Greenbelt Festival. Stan's Cafe has a history of long term collaborators. Amanda Hadingue devised and performed with the company in most major productions between 1993 and 2010. Sarah Dawson devised and performed in most major productions between 1994 and 2000 before concentrating full-time working for her own company, Corali. Heather Burton appeared in The Carrier Frequency revival. She also devised and performed in Lurid and Insane, Framed and Home of the Wriggler as well as touring with Be Proud of Me, It's Your Film and extensively with Of All The People In All The World. Bernadette Russell devised and performed in Framed, Home of the Wriggler and The Cleansing of Constance Brown as well as being recast into The Just Price of Flowers and guest starring in Tuning Out With Radio Z. Playwright, novelist and founding member of Talking Birds Theatre Company Nick Walker devised and performed in Simple Maths and Good and True as well as touring with It's Your Film and making a special guest appearance in I See With My Eyes Closed. Jake Oldershaw first worked with Stan's Cafe having successfully auditioned for Simple Maths, and subsequently appeared in The Carrier Frequency and The Cleansing of Constance Brown before touring extensively with It's Your Film, The Black Maze and The Cleansing of Constance Brown. Andy Watson, who had previously performed in Large Scale International under the name Andy Walker, was persuaded out of retirement to take the lead in Lurid and Insane. He subsequently performed in It's Your Film on tour and both drove and invigilated The Black Maze on tour. He devised The Cleansing of Constance Brown but was taken ill shortly before the premiere performance. His role in this show has subsequently been taken by Gareth Brierly (of The People Show and White Rabbit), Ray Newe (who had previously devised Bingo in the House of Babel and Voodoo City with the company) and Nick Tigg (of SlotMachine). Most recently, this role has been taken by Jake Oldershaw whose original role has in turn been taken by Jack Trow. Gerard Bell first appeared for the company devising The Cleansing of Constance Brown. He picked up the role of Van Driver in the recasting of The Just Price of Flowers, appeared in The Voyage, and devised and performed in The Cardinals and The Anatomy of Melancholy. Chris Dugrenier, Charlotte Gregory, Kerrie Reading and Lucy Nicholls have all performed Of All The People In All The World on numerous occasions, undertaken education work with the company, and appeared in the original production of The Just Price Of Flowers. Gregory was retained for subsequent production of this show and appeared as a replacement performer in The Cleansing of Constance Brown. Jack Trow first collaborated with Stan's Cafe whilst still at school in Adult Child / Dead Child, as a member of Stage 2. In 2008, he started touring with Of All The People In All The World and went on to pick up roles in The Cleansing of Constance Brown and Just Price of Flowers. He has performed in It's Your Film and regularly conducts education work for the company. Rochi Rampal also collaborated with Stan's Cafe whilst still at school in No Wall, Just Doors. She devised and performed in The Cardinals, The Voyage and The Anatomy of Melancholy. Simon Ford has collaborated with the company as graphic designer since 1993. With his company F22 Design, he has also taken on the design of the company's website and CD-ROMs. His most active collaboration with the company has come with The Steps Series where his graphic design is integral to the piece and he collaborates on devising the story alongside Stephens and Yarker. A further key member of the Steps Series team is the visual artist Denise Stanton. Paul Arvidson was the company's long term lighting designer working on almost every major project requiring lighting between 1994 and 2010. For Tuning Out With Radio Z, he improvised the lighting plot alongside the improvised action. Richard Chew composed and recorded music for all Stan's Cafe's productions between 1991 and 1995 as well as Still, a side-project with James Yarker commissioned by English National Opera's Baylis program New Visions/New Voices. Still was a 20-minute opera about John Franklin's attempts to discover the North West Passage. Richard's most involved collaboration with the company came when he devised and performed in Memoirs of an Amnesiac, a piece about the life of an Eric Satie obsessive. Rick also sang live in the swimming pool version of Canute the King. More recently he contributed a short element for The Cardinals that the actors sing live on stage. Besides working on Pieces for the Radio Volume 1, Jon Ward worked with Richard Chew on the soundtrack for Voodoo City. He composed the soundtrack for Simple Maths and various versions of a self- evolving soundtrack for Of All The People In All The World. He also recorded indents and programmed the message board software for Tuning Out With Radio Z. Nina West started composing for Stan's Cafe when a track of hers was heard at a party by James Yarker. She was tracked down and, together with Rebecca Jane Webster, recorded the soundtrack for Ocean of Storms. She devised and performed in Lurid and Insane, performed on Comfort Hour, and created the soundtrack for Be Proud of Me and The Cleansing of Constance Brown for which she toured as the only ever-present member of the performing or technical crew, mixing the soundtrack live for every performance. She has provided soundscapes for Spy Steps, Giant Steps, Apollo Steps, Final Steps and Market Steps. Most recently, she has provided the soundtrack for The Anatomy of Melancholy. Long-time collaborator Ed Dimsdale photographs for every project between 1998 and 2008. He was most closely involved with Be Proud of Me, in which the company formed an integral part of the devising time providing more than a hundred images that help drive the narrative forward when projected behind the action as part of both scenery and the main character's perspective and psychological point of view. Since 2009, the company's production photographs have all been taken by specialist theatre photographer, Graeme Braidwood. @ A. E. Harris In September 2008, Stan's Cafe hired 13,000 square feet of factory space from A E Harris and Co. (Birmingham) Ltd. on Northwood Street in Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter in order to stage Of All The People In All The World. The arrangement worked so well that the two parties came to a long term agreement. From January 2009, Stan's Cafe started using the venue, named @ A. E. Harris as its rehearsal space, performance venue, and office. Through hosting performances and rehearsals from many local companies as well as the inaugural BE Festival (Birmingham European), the venue came to gain an international reputation as an artist-run space. Mixtures of paid and bartered arrangements with British Dance Edition, Birmingham Opera and the Birmingham Repertory Theatre alongside sponsorship support in kind from A E Harris and Co. led to the building's progressive upgrading. The innovate collaboration of Stan's Caf√© with A E Harris and Co. won an Arts and Business Award in 2009.

Considered one of the greatest rovers in the sport's history, he played over 400 games at senior level in the Western Australian Football League (WAFL) and the Victorian Football League (VFL), and later coached in both competitions. Born in Narrogin, Western Australia, Cable made his debut with the Perth Football Club in the WANFL in 1962, and won the Sandover Medal as the fairest and best player in the competition in 1964. Cable was awarded the Tassie Medal as the best player at the 1966 Australian National Football Carnival, as well as selection in the All-Australian team. The same year, he played in the first of three consecutive premierships with Perth, winning the Simpson Medal as the best player in the grand final in each year, as well as a further Sandover Medal in 1968. Cable left Perth at the end of the 1969 season to play for the North Melbourne Football Club in the VFL, and won the club's best and fairest award, the Syd Barker Medal, before returning to Western Australia at the end of the season. Following another three years at Perth, in which he captain-coached the club in 1972 and 1973 and won his third Sandover Medal in the latter year, Cable returned to North Melbourne for the 1974 season. In another four years at the club, he played in two premiership sides, in 1975 and 1977, before again returning to Perth after accepting an offer to captain-coach . Cable retired from playing at the end of the 1979 season, having injured himself in a farming accident. Cable returned to Victoria in 1981 to coach North Melbourne, a role which he held until 1984. He later worked as an assistant at the West Coast Eagles during their first years in the VFL. Having represented Western Australia in a total of 25 matches during his playing career, Cable also coached the team at the 1979 State of Origin Carnival, later being named coach of the All-Australian team. Cable holds \\"Legend\\" status in both the Australian Football Hall of Fame and the West Australian Football Hall of Fame, as well as membership in the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. His tally of seven best and fairest awards at Perth is a club record, and his career total of 405 senior-level games is the most of any player born in Western Australia. Early life The youngest of eleven children, Cable was born in Narrogin, a country town in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. His father, Edward, born in England, died when Cable was six and he was raised by his indigenous mother, Dorothy a member of the Noongar people of south-west Western Australia. Cable spent much of his childhood playing football ‚Äì aged eleven, he was reprimanded by his school headmaster for devoting too much time to playing. Cable debuted for the senior side of his local club, the Narrogin Imperials in the Upper Great Southern Football League (UGSFL), at the age of fifteen. After spending two years as a butcher's apprentice, Cable moved to Perth to attempt to play in the Western Australian National Football League (WANFL). Playing career After being rejected by Western Australian football powerhouse for being \\"too small\\" ‚Äì his playing height was listed as 168 cm, or five-and-a-half feet ‚Äì Cable signed with in 1962. He began his career as a wingman, but late in 1963 was moved to his familiar position of rover. In his first full season there, 1964, Cable would win the first of three Sandover Medals, the highest individual honour in the WAFL. Cable was awarded the Tassie Medal as the best player at the 1966 Australian National Football Carnival, as well as selection in the All- Australian team. The same year, he played in the first of three consecutive premierships with Perth, winning the Simpson Medal as the best player in all three grand finals, as well as a further Sandover Medal in 1968. Cable's first coach at Perth was former premiership captain Ern Henfry, who alerted the Blues about the talented young rover. So in 1964, Carlton invited Cable to Melbourne and signed him on a \\"Form Four\\", which meant that for the next two seasons he was tied to Carlton if he were to play in Victoria. But Cable had no desire to move interstate, despite the repeated urging from Carlton. During the following three seasons, Perth president Cliff Houghton forbade Cable from negotiating with VFL clubs, and when on 6 July 1969 this ban was lifted and Cable spoke with Christian, Geoff; 'President Gives Waive on Cable'; The West Australian, 7 July 1969, p. 23 he did not decide to move. It was not until secretary Ron Joseph flew over to Perth and met with Cable personally in 1969 that Cable decided to play in Victoria. In August of that year, Cable signed a form four with the North Melbourne Football Club, enabling him to transfer to the Victorian Football League (VFL). The secretary of North Melbourne, Ron Joseph, said Cable was \\"genuinely interested in playing League football\\", and wanted to \\"prove himself in Victorian football\\".CABLE HERE NEXT YEAR? ‚Äì The Age.

At the time Cable made his initial move to Victoria, were a struggling team, still a few years away from becoming one of the powerhouses of the decade. 1970 was a miserable year for the Kangaroos as they finished last on the ladder, but Cable justified the hype over his reputation by winning the Syd Barker Medal and finishing fourth in the Brownlow Medal vote count. However, North Melbourne were unable to meet a clause in his contract, which required them to pay Perth $71,000 to retain Cable's services. This was a large sum, especially in the days when being a VFL footballer was not a full-time profession as it would become in later decades. As a result, Cable returned to Western Australia. Back at Perth, Cable captain-coached the club in 1972 and 1973 and won his third Sandover Medal in the latter year. During his absence, North Melbourne had managed to sign former Carlton premiership coach Ron Barassi and took advantage of the short-lived Ten-Year Rule to land the signatures of VFL stars Doug Wade, John Rantall and Barry Davis. With Keith Greig and David Dench starting to emerge as champions, Cable decided to return to North Melbourne for the 1974 VFL season. North Melbourne made it to their first Grand Final since 1950, but lost to . Finally, in 1975, the Kangaroos broke through by defeating to claim their first VFL premiership.

He is considered to be one of the most important performers and composers of Colombian music in the 20th century. He adapted traditional Colombian musical styles such as cumbia and porro into modern rhythms that would become symbols of national identity from the 1930s. His work had a substantial impact around Latin America. His musical work was influenced by the porros and fandangos of the Sabana de Bol√≠var and the coastal towns of northern Colombia.  Early years  El Carmen de Bol√≠var, where Berm√∫dez grew up Berm√∫dez's father died when he was two years old after falling into a ravine, forcing his mother to support the family (including his sister Helena) with limited resources. At four years old, he learned to play the piccolo from his uncle Montes, who, upon discovering the boy's interest and abilities, encouraged him to become a musician. During his childhood, he lived in El Carmen de Bol√≠var. In a military band, he later learned to play the trombone, tuba, trumpet, saxophone and clarinet. Berm√∫dez dedicated himself to learning the rhythms of Colombian Caribbean music, and adapting them to suit an orchestra; in the town of Mar√≠a La Baja he discovered how cumbia was organized by the black community. Seeing a girl called Mar√≠a Isabel dancing with barefoot on the sand, he had the inspiration for his first hit, Prende la Vela. He became musical director for the A Numero uno de Cartagena orchestra, and later the Orquesta del Caribe, in which he played many of his compositions and completed his first recording, including Marbella, Cartagenerita, Joselito Carnaval and Borrachera.  Orchestral career  Thanks to the success of Prende la Vela, he was invited in 1943 to play for a season at the El Metropolitan nightclub in Bogot√°. In 1946, he made his first international trip to Buenos Aires, Argentina, on a six-month contract. There, he formed an orchestra of 22 musicians (including Eduardo Armani), with whom he recorded around 60 songs for record company RCA V√≠ctor. The Hotel Nutibara After returning to Colombia, he and his orchestra were hired to play at the Hotel Granada in the heart of the city of Bogot√°. Berm√∫dez officially presented the Lucho Berm√∫dez Orchestra on July 15, 1947 at the Hotel Granada, initiating an intense agenda of presentations, tours and recordings that would last his entire life. In 1948, he moved to Medell√≠n where he worked as a staff at the Hotel Nutibara, at the Campestre Club and. During this time, he also served as musical artistic director of the radio station \\"La Voz de Antioquia\\". In Medell√≠n, he associated with Pedro Vargas, Eva Garza, Miguelito Vald√©s, Avelina Garc√≠a and To√±a La Negra among others. Medell√≠n became the most important record venue in the country. There, he recorded the song Salsipuedes that turned him into a true popular idol. In all, he spent 15 years in Medell√≠n. In 1952, he was invited to participate in the Festival of Latin American Music in Havana, Cuba, organized by composer Ernesto Lecuona. In Cuba he recorded four songs with RCA V√≠ctor, directed the Orquesta de Bebo Vald√©s for the radio and Lecuona's orchestra for television. Between 1952 and 1954, Berm√∫dez lived in Cuba and Mexico with his orchestra; promoting his music internationally. In Mexico, he met D√°maso P√©rez Prado, Celia Cruz and Beny Mor√©. Upon his return to Colomiba, he was invited to participate in the first ever broadcasts on Colombian television on June 13, 1954. Back in his home country, he recorded around 80 albums. Furthermore, he performed in many major US cities, including New York, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, Las Vegas, Washington and Texas. Berm√∫dez also performed in Venezuela, Costa Rica and Ecuador. Many artists have been inspired by his music, including Hugo Romani, Leo Marini.

Range The lilac silverline is found in India, Myanmar and N.Thailand. In India, this butterfly is found from Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh to southern Karnataka, with also one record each from Rajasthan and Assam. The species has been located in Rawalpindi in Pakistan, and the following Indian states: Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The only resident, breeding population discovered is in Hesarghalla Lake in Bengaluru, Karanataka. Description Cigaritis lilacinus male in Karnataka, India = Male = Cigaritis lilacinus female in Karnataka, India = Female =  Ecology and conservation  The lilac silverline has been recorded from a wide variety of habitats that include protected wildlife reserves such as the Daying Ering Wildlife Sanctuary and Kumbhalgarh Wildlife Reserve, restored institutional campus such as the Agastya Campus in Chitoor, and open plains and gram fields in Uttar Pradesh. In all locations, except at Hessarghatta Lake, very small numbers of the species have been observed, with many observations being one individual. The lilac silverline has been sighted in relatively undisturbed reserves, but a majority of the sightings have been in areas that experience human activities such as grazing, agriculture, grazing, and regular visitations by urban photographers. Caterpillars of lilac silverline are tended by ants that offer protection from predators and parasitoids. The lilac silverline is protected under Schedule II of the Indian (Wildlife) Protection Act. Uncontrolled visits to its breeding habitat in Bengaluru by photographers appear to be destroying its host plant due to the traversing of a large number of vehicles indiscriminately across Hesaraghatta Lake. No other threats have been recognized for this species across its distribution range.

Etymology Early forms of the name include Hotcumbe, Holcumbe, Horcombe and Horkome. The first element of the name is Old English horh, meaning \\"filth,\\" while the suffix, cumb, means \\"bowl-shaped valley\\", and is of Brittonic Celtic origin. The Hole The hollow is deep and about ¬æ mile (1.2 km) across. The Hole was created by a process called spring-sapping, where water welling up from the hillside gradually undermined the slopes above, eating the rocks away grain by grain. In this way, over thousands of years, a once narrow valley widened and deepened into an enormous cauldron. The process continues today.

It had originated from the advisory Council of the Grand Duke, established by Vytautas the Great in the early 15th century. During the reign of Casimir Jagiellon it was renamed to the Council of Lords. Under the Union of Lublin of 1569, the Council formally became a constituent part of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Senates (see also Offices in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth), together with the Royal Council of Poland, but it continued to operate de facto until the mid-17th century. Competence The Council carried out the functions of the Grand Duke after his death and had a supreme authority in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania until a new Grand Duke was appointed, as well as organised his appointment. The first appointed ruler was Casimir Jagiellon, who in exchange expanded the Council's powers significantly and approved the Casimir Code. The Council was granted judicial powers and became an appellate instance, subordinate to the King and acting in the absence of him, who remained the chief justice. Casimir was followed by his son Alexander who issued another privilege in 1492. According to the privilege of 1506 by his brother Sigismund the Old, the new laws could no longer be adopted and the existing could not be amended without the Council's consent. The First Lithuanian Statute of 1529 confirmed its administrative powers, as well as granted legislative powers, exercised together with the Grand Duke of Lithuania. The Council's legislative powers were limited under the subsequent edition of the Lithuanian Statute of 1566, as a result of a growing role of szlachta and its Sejms. The Council carried out executive functions in the state since 1445 because the majority of Lithuanian Grand Dukes resided in Poland. It also convoked the Lithuanian Seimas. Composition The Council had 35 ‚Äì 50 permanent members as of 1529. It consisted of the most prominent representatives of the Lithuanian magnate families, as well as bishops, marshals and treasurers. The ex officio members of the Council were the voivods of Vilnius and Trakai, castellans of Vilnius and Trakai, the Elder of Samogitia, the Grand Hetman of Lithuania and the Grand Chancellor of Lithuania. Since the 16th century, these members comprised a Secret Council which was a de facto core of the Council of Lords, dealing with all crucial state affairs, since the full membership of the Council was rarely convened. A majority of the members were Roman Catholic ethnic Lithuanians; Council of Lords in the State Affairs, by J≈´ratƒó Kiaupienƒó. however, the influence of Ruthenian magnates was constantly increasing.

In 2007 the resort announced a multimillion-dollar renovation program to coincide with the hosting of the 14th ASEAN summit on its premises. 188 rooms in the Ocean Wing were renovated, while a marquee able to accommodate 1,000 guests was also added. The same year the resort celebrated its 15th year with an art exhibition of Cebuano painters, with 50% of proceeds of sales of the works going to charity. A renewal program over three phases from 2012 to 2013 included new room types, existing room makeovers and a new theme, at a cost of P718 million (US$16.5 million). The resort remains particularly popular with tourists from Korea and Japan, but with an increasing number of domestic guests. It also hosts major international events, including the Miss Universe pre-pageant, the APEC summit, and the ASEAN Leader's Summit.  Theme  During the resort's refurbishment for its 20th anniversary, a new theme, \\"ocean to shore,\\" was announced. The resort maintains this concept in part through its own beachfront sanctuary, which was first launched in 2007. Spanning six hectares, the Shangri-La Marine Sanctuary contains 160 species of fish, clams and coral, as well as two sunken ships placed there to form artificial coral. Staff of the hotel maintain the sanctuary alongside steward partners Amores Charities, Inc., Scotty's Action Sports Network and the Government of Lapu-Lapu City.  Design and construction  The resort was designed by Francisco Ma√±osa and Partners, who had the responsibility of creating the first resort of the chain in the Philippines. The concept ‚Äúcalled for a structure nestled in nature,‚Äù and Ma√±osa decided to have the facades of the hotel slope to avoid the structure feeling too monumental amongst the coconut palms. Interior design was developed by Dale Keller & Associates. The in-room teak and mother-of-pearl furniture and decor use Philippine craftsmanship, applied on capiz headboards, timber flooring and decorative fretwork lamps. Landscaping by Belt Collins International (HK) Limited was developed. The shoreline itself was reconfigured to create a sheltered, man- made beach with a ‚Äúnaturalistic island within wading distance.‚Äù Palm trees were planted in clusters with curved paths leading from the resort's main building to the beach, via tropical gardens and lawns.  Features  =Rooms and suites= The resort has 530 rooms split into two wings, the Main and Ocean Wings. The Deluxe and Deluxe Sea View rooms measure 36 square meters, while suites include Mactan, Panorama and Veranda Suites, blending contemporary Filipino craft furnishings with indigenous abaca, capiz, banana leaf and rattan. The Veranda Suites include a private 30-square-meter corner terrace and were introduced during the first phase of renewal for the 20th anniversary of its opening. Ocean Club floor rooms also include personal concierge service and access to the Ocean Club Lounge. A total of 354 rooms were refurbished in the resort's main wing during the 3-phase renovation program. New colours of golden sand and fresh turquoise were added to display the new concept of \\"ocean to shore,\\" with coral and seashell decor. 8 Deluxe Family rooms for small groups were also added, of 45-61 square meters in size and containing two queen size beds. The resort has two suites titled the Shangri-La Suite that are located in the Main Wing. Measuring 136 square meters, they come with a private balcony overlooking the Mactan Sea, a living room, dining area, pantry, and a personal butler. The premier suite is the Presidential Suite in the Ocean Wing, measuring 216 square meters. = Restaurants = The resort holds four speciality restaurants serving a variety of cuisines, as well as bars, \\"Breeze,\\" \\"Buko Bar,\\" \\"Waves Bar,‚Äù and Lobby Lounge. * Cowrie Cove - Modern Day Signature Seafood * Tea of Spring - Chinese * Acqua - Italian * Tides - International = CHI, The Spa = CHI Spa Village opened in June 2005, with six private villas of 135 square meters, pavilions for treatments, and garden suites. The Spa Village extends over 10,000 square meters, containing herbal steam rooms and a spa pool. Services include a \\"water garden\\" and over 30 therapies developed on a philosophy of Chinese yin and yang. Treatments include a traditional Philippine Hilot, using warm coconut oil and banana leaves.

Ronald Hilton was educated at Oxford University and at the University of California at Berkeley and became a US citizen in 1946. He launched the Hispanic American Report in 1948. He spent most of his long working life at Stanford University. Early Years \\"[A]s a child I wandered around the shores on its beautiful bay during World War 1. Navy vessels came and went and I clearly remember arrival of a destroyer different from the ones I was used to; it was American. The United States had just entered the war, and I became conscious of the existence of that distant land, never dreaming that I would make my home there. Some wives of interned Germans were billeted with us; they were kind people, and we became very fond of them. At the same time I saw young English soldiers going off to fight the Hun; I recall how one kindly helped me across a busy street. Then, at the railway station, I would see Red Cross trains arrive, full of young English soldiers with all kinds of ugly wounds. I became aware of the tragic absurdity of such international 'relations.'... My family moved to Winchester, where I haunted the great cathedral where Philip II of Spain, the Devil of the South, married bloody Mary Tudor. The chantry of Bishop Gardiner, in the gaunt counter-reformation style of El Escorial, contrasted with the more lovely ones of earlier bishops, notably that of William of Wykham. One of my first publications was a detailed account of the marriage, based on the conflicting versions of chronicles and historians. I realized that history comes in different colors and shades.\\" He was attached to Oxford university from 1929 to 1937, first to Christ Church (1929‚Äì36), then to Magdalen (1937) majoring in French and minored in Spanish. It was through Salvador de Madariaga that Hilton earned the de Osma scholarship at the Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan and went to Madrid in late March, 1931. Spain 1930s \\"I went to Spain by train, changing at Irun because, while France had standard-gauge track, Spain‚Äôs was broad-gauge. My first shock came when I entered the station men‚Äôs room. Scrawled in black on the wall was ‚Äú¬°Muera el rey!‚Äù (Death to the King!).\\"Chapter 3 His first stop was San Sebastian where there was an active nationals movement. The adventure continued to Alava and Burgos by train that was patrolled by armed Civil Guards. At Avila, huddled by a coal fire in the station waiting room waiting for dawn, hungrily Hilton tried churros that tasted like ambrosia. At Madrid he met the family he would stay with in a modest apartment. Hilton's Madrid experience was dominated by the fall of the monarchy. He observed that any Spaniards, especially the Basques and Catalans, resented Alfonso XIII rule, while the intellectuals were especially resentful because the king scorned them. The army was much in evidence. Many churches and other old buildings had been turned into barracks. When the king left the country, in Madrid the public mood was one of rejoicing. Crowds strolled happily through the sunny streets. The Republicans claimed that they were restoring ancient liberties and that the blue in an old flag symbolized those liberties. The old red- yellow-red striped flag lost one red stripe, replaced by a deep blue one. It happened that the capes of the police had a deep blue lining, so they draped the cape over their shoulders to show their republican sympathies. The crowds appreciated the symbolism and applauded. He returned to England and later recorded that no one realized that a civil war was in the making. \\"British interest in Catalonia derived from the historic trade ties between England and Barcelona, and also from dim memories of the War of the Spanish Succession, when Catalonia sided with Britain. So I decided in 1932 to go to Barcelona.\\"Chapter 4 At the Institute of Catalan Studies, Hilton took courses on Catalan medieval history and literature. He saw the complex character of Catalan nationalism where the revolutionary spirit was expressed in the repeated playing of ‚ÄúEls Segadors‚Äù (‚ÄúThe Harvesters‚Äù), the song of the anti- Spanish country people, just as in Madrid he heard constantly the music of the Hymn of Riego. The refrain of ‚ÄúThe harvesters‚Äù was ‚ÄúBom colp de fals,‚Äù a good blow with a scythe to cut the Spaniards‚Äô heads off. Hilton graduated from Oxford in 1933 deeply dissatisfied with the idea of exclusive study of old book he began a cycling through Europe with his first stop at Strasbourg where he encountered Nazi government for the first time. From there he crossed the Alps to Venice then back to France via through Switzerland. He spent the 1934-35 studying at the Sorbonne to prepare a doctorat d‚Äô√©tat.Chapter 5 While in Paris he took up studying Russian at the Institute of Oriental Languages which made his World Affairs Report possible. In the spring of 1934 he set off to Madrid by bicycle by way of Spain's north coast then through Portugal. At Madrid the atmosphere was very political and politics the major theme of conversation on every level of society. The theme in cafes were 'We have our republic, now we want our revolution! From this moment on there would be no peace in Spain'Chapter 6 Bay Of Pigs He was an academic expert on Latin America who helped to uncover the CIA's clandestine preparations for the Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba in April 1961. During a research trip to Guatemala in 1960, he learned that a group of Cuban exiles were training at a secret camp (which everybody there seemed to know about) for their ill-fated attempt to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime. Hilton was the main source when the left-wing weekly The Nation broke the story in November 1960. The invasion went ahead anyway a few months later, after the Kennedy administration succeeded in persuading the New York Times (NYT), that had decided to follow up the Nation story, to delay publishing its own investigations. Ronald Hilton's publication Hilton later published a series of articles about Castro's (1959) revolution in the Hispanic American Report that were written by Herbert Matthews and which the NYT had declined to publish because it felt that Matthews had grown too close to the Cuban leader. He founded the World Association of International Studies (WAIS) in 1965 (originally known as California Institute of International Studies (CIIS)), a global political, economic and religious forum, after resigning as the Director of the Institute of Hispanic American and Luso-Brazilian Studies (Bolivar House), which he had founded earlier at Stanford University. Hilton continued in his post as the Professor of Romanic Languages at the Stanford University until he retired at the mandatory age of 65. In 1970, he launched the World Affairs Report (WAR), that continued publication until 1990 and became an on-line publication afterward through DIALOG. The main feature of WAR was \\"International Report: The World as Seen from Moscow. It analyzed the Soviet version developments, based on Soviet as well as non-Soviet sources.\\" He became a Visiting Fellow of the Hoover Institution at Stanford in 1987. He died in 2007 from cancer, aged 95. Family In 1939, he married a fellow student, Mary Bowie, while both were enrolled in graduate studies at Berkeley. Mary Bowie Hilton died in 2007. A daughter survives them.

It generally grows on heavier soils. Crushed leaves have a taste and smell reminiscent of turpentine. The cream flowers appear in spring and are fused into compound flowerheads. Taxonomy English botanist James Edward Smith first described the turpentine as Metrosideros glomulifera in 1797, from a collection in the Sydney district. It was given its current binomial name by German botanist Franz Josef Niedenzu in 1893. Common names include turpentine, luster, red turpentine or red luster. It was formerly known as Syncarpia laurifolia Ten. Two subspecies are recognised, the widespread nominate, and subspecies glabra which is found from Bulahdelah north to Kempsey and has smooth leaf undersurfaces. Description In a suitable location, the turpentine grows into a large straight-trunked tree up to 45 or even 55 m (150‚Äì180 ft) high with a DBH of up to 1.3 or even 1.5 m (4‚Äì5 ft). On poorer soils it grows as a small tree or even adopts a mallee habit. The thick brown bark is fibrous, with deep vertical furrows running down the trunk. The leaves are arranged oppositely on the stems, and pairs grow close together so that they resemble a whorled group of four leaves. On 0.7‚Äì1.3 cm long petioles, the thick leaves are ovate to ellipictal and measure 7‚Äì10 cm (2.5‚Äì4 in) long and 2.5‚Äì4.5 cm (1‚Äì1.6 in) across with recurved margins. Their upper surface is a dull dark green, and lower surface much paler, either covered by fine hairs in subspecies glomulifera or smooth in glabra. Flowering takes place from August to December, peaking in September. The cream flowers are fused in groups of seven into compound flowerheads. This is followed by the development of the compound fruit ‚Äì 1 to 2 cm (0.4‚Äì0.8 in) diameter woody capsules which ripen in summer. Distribution and habitat Springwood, Blue Mountains National Park The turpentine is found in eastern Queensland and New South Wales, from Atherton in the far north to as far south as Murramarang National Park. North of Gympie, the distribution is fragmented, with colonies on the Blackdown and Consuelo Tablelands, Tinaroo district and Windsor Tableland. The habitat most commonly associated with the turpentine is transitional forest between rainforest and wet sclerophyll forest. Here it grows as an emergent tree, and is associated with such trees as flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis), tallowwood (E. microcorys), grey ironbark (E. paniculata), white stringybark (E. globoidea), yellow stringybark (E. muelleriana), white-topped box (E. quadrangulata), rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda), brush box (Lophostemon confertus) and various rainforest species. It also grows with spotted gum (Corymbia maculata) and blackbutt (E. pilularis). On poorer soils, it can grow much smaller in dry sclerophyll forest in association with smooth- barked apple (Angophora costata) and yellow bloodwood (Corymbia eximia). Adaptable to a wide range of soils, the turpentine is most suited to moderate to high-nutrient soils, such as clay soil over Wianamatta shale in the Sydney region. Valleys and flat areas are highly suitable sites. In the Sydney region, the species reaches an altitude of 300 m (1000 ft), but this extends to 900 m (3000 ft) above sea level in northern Queensland. The turpentine is one of the dominant species of the critically endangered Sydney Turpentine- Ironbark Forest ecological community. The largest known turpentine, located near the Williams River Recreation Reserve in the Barrington Tops National Park, New South Wales, measures trunk circumference at breast height, tall, crown spread width and \\"points 517\\" (points calculated using the National Register of Big Trees formula). Ecology The flowers are pollinated by native bees and European honeybees, and possibly flies and moths. The grey- headed flying fox (Pteropus poliocephalus) and little red flying fox (P. scapulatus) also pollinate the flowers. The rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus) and noisy miner (Manorina melanocephala) forage for nectar. The turpentine regenerates after bushfire by resprouting from its lignotuber and epicormic buds. Turpentine trees are thought to live up to 500 years. Uses Highly durable, turpentine timber is used in heavy-traffic flooring, for poles and wharves. It resists marine invertebrates and termites, and is one of the most difficult timbers to ignite. A hardy and adaptable tree, turpentine tolerates heavy soils and frosts, and is suitable for large gardens and parks, where it provides good shade with its dense canopy.

Early life and career Born Constance Annie Skinner on December 7, 1877, at Quesnel, British Columbia, Canada to Robert and Annie (Lindsay) Skinner, Skinner later substituted her mother's maiden name for the middle name that appeared on her birth certificate.Ann Heidbreder Eastman (ed.), Constance Lindsay Skinner: Author and Editor, Blacksburg, VA: Women's National Book Association, 1980, pp. 17-18; p. 1. Her father was an agent for the Hudson's Bay Company. In 1891 the family relocated to Vancouver, British Columbia. By this time, Skinner was already writing, completing her first published work, In Gelderland, during her teen years. In 1893, Skinner went to live with her aunt in California. While little is known of her childhood, much of the history and many of the novels and stories she wrote in later years were related to the northwest, Canada, and the gold rush. Between 1902 and 1907 she moved from California to New York City, where she expanded her repertoire to include plays and criticism. She was a regular theater critic for the New York Herald Tribune. While it is unclear when her first novel was published, by 1917, one of her novels, Good-Morning Rosamond!, had been adapted into a three-act comedy and performed at the Shubert Theatre. Rivers of America series In 1936 Skinner became the architect and first editor of the Rivers of America Series for the publishers Farrar & Rinehart. In an essay published in the early volumes of the Series she described the Series as being an exploration and interpretation of American folklife through the history, exploration, and flow of America's rivers. Originally conceived as 24 volumes, Skinner died March 27, 1939, from a coronary occlusion with arteriosclerosis.Edward T.

The software provides ways for users to visualize information in mind maps and flowcharts. MindManager can be used to manage projects, organize information, and for brainstorming. , Mindjet had approximately two million users, including notable customers such as Dow, Microsoft, Pfizer, and Cisco.  Features  MindManager provides ways for users to visualize information using mind maps, and with the release of MindManager 2016 for Windows, now includes flowchart and concept map creation tools. The digital mind maps can be used as a ‚Äúvirtual whiteboard‚Äù for brainstorming, managing and planning projects, compiling research, organizing large amounts of information, and for strategic planning. MindManager also has features that allow budget calculations and formulas, Gantt chart views of project timelines, and guided brainstorming. Documents can be attached to mind map topics and viewed within the MindManager application. Links, images, and notes can also be added to mind map topics and viewed and searched in a side panel.  Development  Formulas in MindManager The software that became MindManager was originally developed by Mike Jetter in the mid-1990s while he was recovering from a bone marrow transplant to treat leukemia. Jetter's goal was to develop a program that would overcome the limitations of creating mind maps with pen and paper, such as the inability to easily move items around. Following his release from hospital, Jetter decided to sell the software. The software's mind maps were initially based on the method created by Tony Buzan. Over time, however, Mindjet has developed its own style of mind mapping. The software was originally marketed under the name \\"MindMan ‚Äî The Creative MindManager\\". In 1999, it was rebranded as MindManager. Originally only available for Windows, MindManager expanded to Mac OS X in 2006. With the release of version 7, the Windows version of MindManager adopted the ribbon interface first seen in Microsoft Office 2007 and introduced support for Office Open XML. In 2011, mobile versions of MindManager were released for both iOS and Android. Later that year, the company acquired Thinking Space, an Android-based information mapping application, and Cohuman, a social task management service, which the company developed into a collaborative, cloud-based service to complement MindManager called Mindjet Connect or Project Director. In September 2012, the Mindjet company combined all of its software, including MindManager, Mindjet Connect, and its mobile offerings into a single product, also called Mindjet. Mindjet moved away from the single-product offering in mid-2013. The stand- alone mind mapping product was again named MindManager, with a more expansive version tailored to large enterprise adoptions called MindManager Enterprise released in 2014. MindManager Enterprise added sharing options including viewing/editing within Microsoft SharePoint. A MindManager mind map viewer also became available with MindManager Enterprise 2016. On August 9, 2016, Corel announced that they had acquired the Mindjet MindManager business.  Reception and awards  MindManager has received generally positive notice from reviewers. MindManager 2016 for Windows took first place in Biggerplate's MindMapper's Choice poll. MindManager 8 received four out of five stars from TechRadar, while MindManager 9 received 3.5 out of 5 stars from PC Magazine and 4 out of 5 stars from Macworld. MindManager was chosen as one of the top 5 best mind mapping tools. MindManager also received a number of awards, including \\"Collaboration Product of the Year\\" for 2008 by Intranet Journal, a Jolt Productivity award for Design and Modeling tools from Dr. Dobb's Journal, and \\"Best of CeBIT\\" in the Personal Software category in 2004.

Early life Avery was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, the son of Howard Malcom Avery, a U.S. Navy officer and pilot, and Frances Avery. He was raised and educated in Honolulu, Oakland, California, and Washington, D.C.. Avery started his career in journalism in 1955, working at a variety of newspapers in Mississippi, Texas and Alaska before returning to Hawaii and hiring on at the Honolulu Advertiser where he was appointed the paper's Big Island bureau chief. He was 23 years old at the time. San Francisco Chronicle career Avery joined the San Francisco Chronicle in 1959. In the second half of the 1960s, Avery took a leave of absence from the Chronicle and moved his family to Vietnam. In Saigon, Avery co-founded Empire News, a freelance photojournalism organization. He expanded Empire News, opening a branch in Hong Kong, before returning to San Francisco, in 1969 after three years in Asia. In the mid-1980s, after working for The Sacramento Bee and writing a book about the Hearst kidnapping, he signed up with the then- Hearst-owned San Francisco Examiner, where he stayed until his retirement in August 1994. =Zodiac Killer= Avery reported on the Zodiac case, a series of killings‚Äîunsolved to this day‚Äîthat began in December 1968 and ostensibly ended with the death of a San Francisco cab driver in October 1969. At the time, Avery was a police reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle. For a long time, it was thought that the Zodiac's activities were limited to the Bay Area, but Avery discovered a 1966 murder in Riverside that he linked to the Zodiac. The Zodiac soon wrote Avery (misspelled by the Zodiac as \\"Averly\\") a Halloween card, warning, \\"You are doomed.\\" The front of the card read, \\"From your secret pal: I feel it in my bones/you ache to know my name/and so I'll clue you in...\\" Then inside: \\"But why spoil the game?\\" Just as quickly as the threat was made public, a fellow journalist made up hundreds of campaign-style buttons, worn by nearly everyone on Chronicle staff, including Avery, that said, \\"I Am Not Paul Avery.\\" It was at this time that Avery began carrying a .38 caliber revolver. =Patty Hearst= When Patricia Hearst was kidnapped in February 1974, Avery joined forces with Chronicle reporter Tim Findley to produce a series of stories detailing the kidnapping and writing about the members of the little-known band of revolutionaries called the Symbionese Liberation Army. Avery covered the Hearst case until the newspaper heiress-turned-bank robber was arrested in September 1975. Avery then holed up on his houseboat at Gate 5 in Sausalito with Boston writer Vin McLellan to write The Voices of Guns, a book on the SLA and the Hearst kidnapping.\\" =Later work= Despite his progressive illness with emphysema, Avery continued working in crime and journalism until the end of his life. After joining The Sacramento Bee in 1976, he discovered that authorities had wrongly charged an innocent man with murder, and was instrumental in convincing detectives to drop the charges. Personal life While covering the war in Vietnam, Avery suffered a spinal fracture when a falling tree limb knocked him from atop an armored personnel carrier. Avery died of pulmonary emphysema in West Sound, Washington, on December 10, 2000. Avery's family scattered his ashes in the San Francisco Bay the following June. At the time of his death, Avery was married to Margo St. James, a feminist organizer and founder of the sex worker's rights group COYOTE (Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics). He has two daughters from an earlier marriage, Charl√© Avery and Cristin Avery. He has a third daughter, Janet Anderson. In media Avery was portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the 2007 film Zodiac. The film details his involvement in the Zodiac case, including his discovery of the 1966 Riverside murder, the threat on his life, the \\"I Am Not Avery\\" buttons, a heavily fictionalized involvement with cartoonist turned Zodiac expert Robert Graysmith, as well as his eventual physical decline, including his abuse of cocaine and alcohol. The film ends with a brief mention of his fatal illness and death. In 2010, his former colleague Lance Williams wrote that the movie \\"portrayed Avery as ruined by the Zodiac... That just wasn't true.\\"Williams, Lance (January 7, 2010). \\"Did the Zodiac killer haunt Paul Avery?\\". California Watch.

Parish =Catholic Parish of Ballylooby and Tubrid= According to Power's history, 'Place-names of Decies', this modern parish includes the ancient parishes of Whitechurch, Tubrid, and Tullaghorton (Castlegrace) with a section that was once the western portion of Rochestown It extends from the summit of the Galtees in the north, to the summit of the Knockmealdown range in the south.Power, Patrick: Waterford and Lismore-A Compendious History of the United Dioceses : Cork University Press: 1937 The parish has two churches, at Ballylooby village and Duhill respectively. The Catholic church is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin and St. Kieran. Mass is also celebrated at the recently renovated church at Duhill. Village =Church of Our Lady and St. Kieran= Our Lady's and St. Kieran's Church The first church built in the village of Ballylooby ran East- West, on the site of the present structure. Its orientation was at right angles to the current building, constructed in 1813 by Rev. John Burke. The site of the old church was too small for the growing congregation, and so an extra twenty-six perches were bought from Patrick Burke. The land deal did not go smoothly and the latter erected a wall within the church and sought writs for trespass against those who crossed it. The heated disagreement lasted for several years but was eventually settled, and the wall removed in due course. St. Kieran's was remodelled (all but rebuilt), in 1927/1928 by the parish priest M. Walsh with the architect Rudolf Maximilian Butler. It was funded by local subscription, and many of the pews and stained glass windows bear the names of local families that sponsored them. =Schools= Former National Schools, Ballylooby The present Parish Hall, adjacent to the church and bridge was once the village school, or more correctly schools. Both the boys and girls classes, though operating under one roof, were administered separately. =RIC Barracks= Former village RIC barracks The Royal Irish Constabulary operated a barracks in the village for many years. It was sold to the local school-master, Michael Keating, by District Inspector Gilbert Potter in 1919 and so avoided damage by the Third Tipperary Brigade, during the Irish War of Independence.,A letter regarding the sale from R.I.C District Inspector Gilbert Norman Potter can be seen on display at the museum in Clonmel. D.I Potter was executed by the I.R.A in 1921 at Rathgormack, several days after his capture near Ballylooby. In December 1920, the barracks fleetingly became the focus of international attention when Daniel Francis Crowley and John Tangney, both ex-R.I.C Constables formerly stationed there, testified before the American Commission on Conditions in Ireland. They dramatically gave their reasons for quitting the force as the \\"brutality and lawlessness\\" of the contemporary administration, particularly the Black and Tans, as witnessed by them on their transfer from Ballylooby to Clogheen Barracks.Coyle, Albert ed.: pp390-397: Evidence on Conditions in Ireland -comprising the complete testimony affidavits and exhibits presented before the American Commission on Conditions in Ireland :Washington D.C. 1921 Places of local interest =Duhill Church= Detail of the Beheading of John the Baptist window by Harry Clarke Duhill church, the building of which was commenced in 1829 and completed in 1830, is dedicated to St. John the Baptist (Decollation).

Early proponents of anti-poetry include the Chilean Nicanor Parra and the Greek Elias Petropoulos. Parra, known as the father of anti-poetry, published his first collection of antipoems in 1954 and sought to reject the belief that verse holds any mystical power. The poems have been described as prose-like, irreverent, and illuminating the problems of human existence.\\"Parra, Nicanor: INTRODUCTION.\\" Poetry Criticism. Ed. David Galens. Vol. 39.

The inspiration for many of Mr. Petropoulos poems had been the harsh, and sad atmosphere of the wall divided German metropolis where he was residing. Mr. Petropoulos had long come to the conclusion that poetry about love and desires was becoming too gentle for the literature of modern age. Rather it was time to introduce anti-poetry by incorporating anti- sentimentalism feelings and reaction within poems.Taylor, John. ‚ÄúPoetry Today‚Äù N.p., Web. June 1, 2009. Early history During 5th century B.C theatrical Sketches called Mimes were being introduced with ideas and languages that were determined to be Anti-plays. There had been times when poets would turn against his/her own poetry in an antagonistic way. Anti poetry can be found and cited from the first poets of Italy and also (Dante, followed by Petrarch) as well as some other places in Europe. They had made the decision to compose verses in vernacular rather than Latin; they were behaving in an anti-poetic manner. Many Playwrights which include both William Shakespeare and Moliere were some of the writers cited for using Anti-poetry within their work now and then in the midst of a verse play. Modern Anti-poetry Anti-poetry has been picked up in the 21st century. Modern anti-poetry carries the same spirit as the early writers, but is still distinct in nature. In modern anti-poetry, punctuation is minimal and only used as necessary. Formatting and capitalization are simple and friendly to the eye. It also incorporates new vocabulary and depicts poetic images and scenes.

Early life Azzolino was born at Fermo, the son of Pompeo Azzolino and Giulia Ruffo. He was the great-nephew of Cardinal Decio Azzolino, the elder, and is thus often referred to as Cardinal Decio Azzolino, the younger. He received doctorates in philosophy, law and theology from the University of Fermo. On 18 January 1642 Pope Urban VIII named Bishop Giovanni Giacomo Panciroli nuncio extraordinary to Spain. Azzolino followed Panciroli to Madrid, and in 1644 when Pope Innocent X appointed Panciroli as secretary of state, he began assisting him in the secretariat. When Panciroli died in September 1651, Azzolino managed the secretariat until the return of Bishop Fabio Chigi from Germany. Chigi was named secretary of state in December.Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492‚Äì1700, (Gianvittorio Signorotto, Maria Antonietta Visceglia, eds.), Cambridge University Press, 2002 As an agent of Donna Olimpia Coat of arms of Decio Azzolino Azzolino was a skilled cryptographer, responsible for cracking ciphers used in correspondence. He was also an able investigator. When the Kingdom of Naples was made aware of invasion plans by Henry II, Duke of Guise, it was Azzolino who (in February 1654) concluded that the breach must have come from Camillo Astalli, the Pope's Cardinal-Nephew. Though likely accurate, his conclusion was convenient - Astalli was a rival for power to Olimpia Maidalchini, Azzolino's own patron.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) Contemporary John Bargrave noted that there were plenty of spies within the Vatican but that none excelled at the task more than Azzolino. Cardinalate Decio Azzolino Later in 1654, because of this service he rendered to the pope, Azzolino was elevated to cardinal and was made cardinal-priest of the church of Sant'Adriano al Foro (Curia Julia) in Rome. He participated in the papal conclave of 1655 which elected Pope Alexander VII. Azzolino was the leader of the independent liberal movement Squadrone Volante, which played a role in engineering the result of the conclave in favour of an anti-nepotism candidate. History of the popes; their church and state (Volume III) by Leopold von Ranke (Wellesley College Library, reprint; 2009) Azzolino's Squadrone also is thought to have engineered the election of Giulio Rospigliosi as Pope Clement IX at the papal conclave of 1667. Rospigliosi, who had been cardinal secretary of state, rewarded Azzolino by immediately (on the night of his election, in fact) appointing him to the position, giving further credence to the rumour. Azzolino and Christina Letter from Queen Christina to Decio Azzolino in the National Archives of Sweden See Wikimedia Commons for others Azzolino was appointed Queen Christina of Sweden's representative within the Catholic Church. It is certain he looked after her financial businesses. Some have speculated that he and Christina were in love with one another. Bargrave, again, suggested that Azzolino was sent to Romania by Pope Alexander in order to avoid public perception that a relationship was ongoing. In July 1659, she moved to Trastevere to live in Palazzo Riario, on top of the Janiculus, designed by Bramante. It was Cardinal Azzolino who signed the contract as well as provided her with new servants to replace Francesco Maria Santinelli, who had been Monaldeschi's executioner. Azzolino ensured that she was reconciled with the pope and that the latter granted her a pension. Christina wrote him many letters during her travels. On 26 January 1667, Christina wrote (in French) that she never would offend God or give Azzolino reason to take offence, but this \\"does not prevent me from loving you until death, and since piety relieves you from being my lover, then I relieve you from being my servant, for I shall live and die as your slave\\". Maintaining celibacy, his replies were more reserved. In 1675, he suggested Christina to appoint Romolo Spezioli, also from Fermo, like Cesare Machiati, as her physician.FABIOLA ZURLINI, UNIVERSITA DEGLI STUDI DI MACERATA The Correspondence between the Personal Physician of the Queen Christina of Sweden Cesare Macchiati and the Cardinal Decio Azzolino Junior in the Seventeenth Century Azzolino also introduced her to Miguel Molinos. In her basement there was a laboratory, where she, Giuseppe Francesco Borri and Azzolino experimented with alchemy. Cardinal Azzolino stayed at her side until she died on 19 April 1689. Azzolino burnt most of their correspondence; about 80 letters have survived. Some details were written in a code that was decrypted by Carl Bildt in Rome around 1900. Christina's letters Azzolino inherited her important art collection, including Correggio's Dana√´ and two versions of Titian's Venus and Adonis (probably the \\"Lausanne\\" and Getty versions). Azzolino died a few weeks later and is buried in the oratorium of the Church of Santa Maria in Vallicella. His nephew Pompeo Azzolino was his sole heir, and he rapidly sold off Christina's art collections, much of which later formed the core of the Orleans Collection.

He had a formula for wood putty which he and his wife mixed up in the laundry sink and sold to hardware stores and glaziers. He then launched two more products, Selleys Metallic Cement and Selleys Unifix, which are still available today, as is the Wood Putty. The huge success of the company was slow to arrive, but as DIY became more popular, the Selleys product range expanded to meet demands, and eventually Selleys was selling adhesives, sealants and much more, and the Selley's slogan, \\"If it's Selleys, it works,\\" (which was conceived in the lounge room of Doug Stewart at 45 Goodwin Tce. Moorooka, Brisbane) became recognised by most people. Doug Stewart (chief consultant and representative for Selleys in Queensland from 1959 to 1977) was sent to Sydney to oversee the use of Selleys Unifix to secure the tiles on the Sails of the Sydney Opera House during construction. Selleys is now a subsidiary of Dulux Group, an Australian listed company on the S&P;/ASX 200.

It was co-founded in 1991 by the electronic music duo Slam, Dave Clarke and Glenn Gibbons. The label is known for releasing early works of Slam, Jeff Mills, Silicone Soul‚Äôs ‚Ä≥Right On Right On‚Ä≥, Funk D‚ÄôVoid, Felix da Housecat‚Äôs early track ‚Ä≥Clashback‚Ä≥, the original vinyl version of Daft Punk's track ‚Ä≥Da Funk‚Ä≥ and much more. History The origin of the label goes back to 1991 when there was very much a DIY ethos back at the tail end of the 80s. In that time, electronic music became more dominant in the music industry, with a greater reliance on synthesizers and the adoption of programmable drum machines and the advent of affordable music technology. A lot of enthusiastic group founders of people such as Soma founders that were passionated about music created a lot of well-known labels that are still existing nowadays. So there was the DJ and music producer duo called Slam consisting of Orde Meikle and Stuart McMillan who met in 1986 in Sheffield, where former was studying Geography at university and later was working in a bar. They did try to get some help from the rock infrastructure that existed in Scotland and sell the idea to a couple of people involved in the music industry, but they failed. So they decided to go to a small studio to make their first couple of tracks with Rejuvenation ‚Äî duo from UK, consisting of Jim Muotune and Glenn Gibbons and press 1000 vinyls of techno EP called \\"Eterna / I.B.O.\\". Jim and Glenn were the sound engineers for the release. In addition, \\"Eterna\\" is still not only the first but one of the most iconic tracks of label's history. After all, they phoned record shops and asked them if they would like to buy 10 or 15 of vinyls, and the whole profit went to another 1000 vinyls pressed, and that is how Soma, they say, was born. Soma is most known for releasing the original vinyl version of Daft Punk's track Da Funk in 1995. It contains uncredited beat sample of \\"Rock Bounce Roll Skate\\" performed by Vaughan Mason & Crew and drum break sample of \\"I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little More Babe\\" performed by Barry White.This is what label's manager says about them in his interview to Fabric: The label celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2011 and released the ‚Ä≥Soma Records ‚Äì 20 Years compilation‚Ä≥ on 19 September 2011. The compilation contains a Daft Punk demo recording of a track called \\"Drive\\" that remained in the label's archives. On 31 March 2017 they turned 25 years old and to celebrate their anniversary, Soma enlisted Jeff Mills, Robert Hood, Adam Beyer and many others to contribute to a special box set ‚Ä≥Soma25‚Ä≥, which includes their long-lost remix of Daft Punk‚Äôs ‚Ä≥Drive‚Ä≥.

Maule was the second surviving son of Harry Maule, of Kellie, Forfar and his second wife Anne Lindsay, daughter of Patrick Lindsay of Kilbirnie, Ayrshire. His father was shire commissioner in the Parliament of Scotland. He was half brother to William Maule, 1st Earl Panmure.

He was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Aberdeen Burghs at a by election on 8 June 1739 and supported the administration. He was elected again at the 1741 British general election but at the time of the second Jacobite rebellion of 1745 came under suspicion of being a Jacobite because of his ancestry. However he was classed as 'Old Whig' in 1746 and was returned unopposed at the 1747 British general election.

It played a crucial role in the proposal to form a colony in Sierra Leone. The work of the Committee overlapped to some extent with the campaign to abolish slavery in Britain and its empire. The Black Poor in 18th-century England The \\"Black Poor\\" was the name given in the late 18th century to indigent residents of London who were of black ancestry. The Black Poor had diverse origins. The core of the community were people who had been brought to London as a result of Atlantic slave trade; sometimes as slaves or indentured servants who had served on slave ships. At the time, black American sailors served on both navy and merchant ships. The Black Poor had become a rare but noticeable sight on the streets of London. Most of the Black Poor lived in impoverished East End parishes, or in Seven Dials and Marylebone. They formed a portion of the broader Black British community, which predominantly consisted of people employed at menial urban jobs, but had prominent members such as Ignatius Sancho and Olaudah Equiano. While the broader community included some women, the Black Poor seem to have exclusively consisted of men, some of whom developed relationships with local women and often married them. Relief efforts Georgiana of Devonshire Stingo On 5 January 1786, an announcement appeared in the Public Advertiser that Mr. Brown, a baker in Wigmore Street, Cavendish Square, was to \\"give a Quartern Loaf to every Black in Distress, who will apply on Saturday next between the Hours of Twelve and Two\\". Details followed that enabled people to subscribe. A meeting was organised for 10 January and by the end of the month, a group had summarised the situation. Originally concern was expressed about Lascars, Asian seamen. But, the group found that there were about 250 \\"Blacks in Distress,\\" of whom only 35 came from the East Indies, the others being from Africa or the West Indies. One hundred men said they had been in the Royal Navy. In common with other responses to serious social problems, the issue was addressed by concerned citizens who set up appeals and fund-raising lists, e.g. there was also a subscription list to support distressed weavers in Spitalfields. After the original meeting, held in the premises of Mr Faulder, a bookseller of Bond Street, subsequent meetings were held in Batson's Coffee House, opposite the Royal Exchange. The effort attracted some prominent figures from London's financial elite: George Peters, Governor of the Bank of England, Thomas Boddington, the noted philanthropist and slave owner, John Julius Angerstein, General Robert Melville. Montagu Burgoyne was the original chair person, but after a few weeks his business interests took him away from London and he was replaced by Benjamin Johnson, who in turn suffered ill- health and was replaced by Jonas Hanway. The abolitionists Samuel Hoare and two of the three Thornton brothers, Henry and Samuel, were also involved, along with James Pettit Andrews and Sir Joseph Andrews.Stephen Braidwood, Black Poor and White Philanthropists: London's Blacks and the Foundation of the Sierra Leone Settlement 1786 - 1791, Liverpool University Press, 1994. On 14 February The Morning Herald remarked: :\\"The example of the Duchess of Devonshire, in contributing to the relief of the poor Blacks, has had a salutary effect. The Countess of Salisbury, the Countess of Essex, Marchioness of Buckingham and a variety of other titled characters are also on the charitable list.\\" When the appeal was closed on 18 April, a total of ¬£890 1s had been raised. Donors included many bishops and clergy, including Herbert Mayo and William Pitt. Aside from general benevolence, this cause attracted particular sympathy because so many were Black Loyalists who had served in the British armed forces and been resettled in London after the American Revolution. The largest donation was collected from among the Quakers by Samuel Hoare. The Committee soon organised two venues for regular distribution of alms: the White Raven tavern in Mile End and the Yorkshire Stingo, in Lisson Grove, Marylebone. These venues were open for several hours a day providing outdoor relief. There was also a sick house set up in Warren Street, where 40-50 men needing medical attention were provided for with indoor relief. Some of the recipients of aid were found jobs, particularly as seamen. In providing clothes so that men could get work as sailors, some of the committee members were simply applying the same charitable methods they had used in organisations such as the Marine Society. But, the shortage of work at sea meant that unemployment remained a problem. Surplus labour was drifting in from the countryside, and many English people also took up begging in London. Lacking the resources to set up any new industry, the Committee took heed of such individuals as Richard Weaver who was \\"willing and desirous to go to Halifax and other Parts of Nova Scotia where there is a fairer Prospect of Employment\\" (see Black Nova Scotians). Soon the charity focused its goals on giving \\"a temporary relief to the objects of the Charity, and in future to provide them with clothes and a settlement abroad\\" . . . \\"to such places as may put them in a condition of getting their bread in freedom and comfort\\". Migration to Sierra Leone The committee also was instrumental in the transfer of Black Poor to Sierra Leone. There was a desire to remove black people from London.Peter Fryer in Staying Power: The History of Black People in Britain (London: Pluto Press, 1984; p. 195) quotes a contemporary commentator who called them \\"indigent, unemployed, despised and forlorn\\", saying that \\"it was necessary they should be sent somewhere, and be no longer suffered to invest [sic] the streets of London\\" (C. B. Wadstr√∂m, An Essay on Colonization, 1794-5, II, 220). The Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme was proposed by entomologist Henry Smeathman and drew interest from humanitarians like Granville Sharp saw it as a means of showing the pro-slavery lobby that black people could contribute towards the running of the new colony of Sierra Leone. However, government officials became involved because they saw the scheme as a useful tool to remove the black poor from the streets of London, and slave oweners were also involved in the scheme. William Pitt the Younger, prime minister and leader of the Tory party, had an active interest in the Scheme.Sivapragasam, Michael, ‚ÄòWhy Did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?‚Äô Unpublished Masters dissertation (London: Open University, 2013), p. 22. There was a prevalent view among the contemporary British West Indian plantocracy that racial intermarriage was abhorrent. However, the chair of the committee wrote to the Standing Committee of West India Planters and Merchants requesting their advice and assistance in procuring an act of parliament to \\"prevent any Foreign Blacks being brought to this country to remain\\". By the end of October 1786, three transport ships were commissioned and docked at Deptford. The applicants for the settlement were to sign an agreement, agreeing to the condition that they would retain the status of British subjects, to be defended by the Royal Navy. They were then given a document granting the citizenship of Sierra Leone. Some historians believe that, with government assistance, in total 4,000 blacks were transported from London for resettlement to the colony of Sierra Leone in 1787. However, even though the Committee signed up about 700 members of the Black Poor, only 441 boarded the three ships that set sail from London to Portsmouth.Sivapragasam, Michael, ‚ÄòWhy Did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?‚Äô Unpublished Masters dissertation (London: Open University, 2013), p. 35. The authorities, with the support of the Committee, sought to force street beggars from the streets of London to make up numbers. However, a lot of black Londoners were no longer happy to take part in the Scheme, and the acts of coercion used by the Committee and the government to force black Londoners to board the ship may have had the opposite effect.Sivapragasam, Michael, ‚ÄòWhy Did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?‚Äô Unpublished Masters dissertation (London: Open University, 2013), pp. 26-7. Equiano, who was originally involved in the Scheme, became one of its most vocal critics. Another prominent black Londoner, Ottobah Cugoano, also condemned the project.Sivapragasam, Michael, ‚ÄòWhy Did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?‚Äô Unpublished Masters dissertation (London: Open University, 2013), pp. 28-33. On 9 April 1787, the ships left Portsmouth with about 280 Black men, 70 White women and 40 Black women. They were accompanied by some English tradesmen. White women who accompanied the Black men were more likely to be the wives or girlfriends. On the voyage between Plymouth and Sierra Leone, 96 passengers died.Sivapragasam, Michael, ‚ÄòWhy Did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783-1815?‚Äô Unpublished Masters dissertation (London: Open University, 2013), p. 36. The ones that could finish the voyage arrived off the shore of Sierra Leone on 15 May 1787.

The battle was fought on March 10, 1710, in the province of Scania, just outside the city of Helsingborg, and directly on the Ringstorp heights just north-east of the city.Svenska slagf√§lt, Lars Ericson, Martin H√•rdstedt, Per Iko, Ingvar Sj√∂blom och Gunnar √Öselius, Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand 2003, .Marklund (2008), pp. 206‚àí208Eriksson (2007), pp. 205‚àí209 Denmark-Norway had been forced out of the Great Northern War by the Treaty of Traventhal in 1700, but had long planned on reopening hostilities with the goal of reconquering the lost provinces Scania, Halland and Blekinge. After the Swedish defeat at Poltava in 1709, the Danes saw an opportunity and declared war on Sweden the same year. The declaration of war arrived at the Swedish state council on October 18, 1709. The pretext given was that Sweden had been intentionally trying to avoid paying the Sound Dues, and that the population of Scania, Halland, Blekinge and Bohusl√§n had been mistreated by the Swedish.Svenska slagf√§lt, Lars Ericson, Martin H√•rdstedt, Per Iko, Ingvar Sj√∂blom och Gunnar √Öselius, Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand 2003, . On January 1710, the Danish invasion force defeated a smaller Swedish force outside Kristianstad in a small skirmish. On March 10, 1710, the Danish force finally engaged the Swedish army, which had been hastily drafted from the surrounding regions to try and resist the Danes. The Swedish cavalry carried the day during the engagement, with the Danish lines crumbling and retreating under repeated charges. The battle proved to be a total rout for the Danes, with more than half of their force killed, wounded or captured. The battle ended any hopes for the Scanian territories to return to Danish rule, and the territories became a permanent part of Sweden.Svenska slagf√§lt, Lars Ericson, Martin H√•rdstedt, Per Iko, Ingvar Sj√∂blom och Gunnar √Öselius, Wahlstr√∂m & Widstrand 2003, .Marklund (2008), pp. 206‚àí208Eriksson (2007), pp. 205‚àí209 Background A portrait of Magnus Stenbock, by Georg Engelhard Schr√∂der. In late fall 1709, an enormous Danish fleet gathered in √òresund, and on November 2 it arrived at R√•√•. The Danish invasion force was led by general Christian Ditlev Reventlow and consisted of 15,000 men divided into six cavalry regiments, four dragoon regiments, eight infantry regiments and six artillery companies. It was met with virtually no resistance from the Swedes. The Swedish army was in terrible shape after Poltava, when several regiments had been completely annihilated. The work on reconstructing and recruiting the regiments had begun immediately after Poltava, but by late summer 1709, general Magnus Stenbock only had one Scanian line regiment in battle-ready condition. The Swedish counterattack would have to wait and the army retreated into Sm√•land. In the beginning of December, the Danes controlled almost all of central Scania except for Landskrona and Malm√∂. Their objective was to capture the naval base at Karlskrona in Blekinge, and the Danish army advanced quickly into Swedish territory. In January 1710, it defeated a smaller Swedish force in a skirmish outside Kristianstad.Marklund (2008), pp. 206‚àí208Eriksson (2007), pp. 205‚àí209 Stenbock had frantically tried to assemble a new army and several fresh regiments had begun to assemble in V√§xj√∂, from where Stenbock had planned to march. The raw recruits were exercised daily on a frozen lake close to the city. By February 5, Stenbock had moved his force to Osby where additional regiments joined them. By now, about 14,000 men were part of his army. Helsingborg was the key to Scania and Stenbock intended on marching through R√∂nne√• to K√§vlinge√•n, in doing so cutting off the Danish supply lines. The Danish commander, Reventlow, saw the threat and turned immediately to meet the Swedes, but when they reached Ringsj√∂n in central Sk√•ne, Reventlow was suddenly struck down with illness and had to yield command of his army to lieutenant-general J√∏rgen Rantzau. Rantzau feared being wedged between the main Swedish army and the Swedish garrison in Malm√∂ and therefore moved towards Helsingborg. Once in the city, Rantzau could be reinforced and when he camped his force amounted to 10,000 foot soldiers and 4,000 horsemen. Stenbock received the news of the Danish march and raced towards Helsingborg. On the night of February 28, he camped northeast of the city. The Swedish army was at the time roughly as large as the Danish army.Marklund (2008), pp. 206‚àí208Eriksson (2007), pp. 205‚àí209 Battle Magnus Stenbock at Helsingborg, by Gustaf Cederstr√∂m. On the morning of February 28, Stenbock marched south towards Helsingborg. When he approached the Danish positions he ordered his army to assume battle formations. A thick morning fog lay over the area and hid the two parties from seeing each other. When the fog lifted the two commanders reviewed the terrain and the position of their respective armies. Rantzau saw that the Swedish army outflanked his own left flank in the west and was forced to dispatch troops to reinforce it quickly. Rantzau had deployed his artillery on the Ringstorp heights, from where they started firing at the Swedish troops at noon. Instead of exploiting the comparatively weak Danish west flank Stenbock turned his army eastward to the Danish right flank. This was perceived by the Danes as an attempt to encircle their eastern flank, and to prevent this they marched further east, opening up gaps in the Danish line of battle that couldn't be filled by reserve troops. In the east, near Brohuset, the first skirmishes of the battle took place. The Swedes were repelled there and Swedish commander, Burenski√∂ld, was captured. However, the rest of the Swedish east flank was able to force the Danes backwards and soon the Danish forces were at a disadvantage. Rantzau participated in the fighting personally, disregarding of the direction the battle was going in, and was eventually wounded by a bullet through the lung. At the same time a rumor developed in the Danish east flank that the Swedes had encircled them and were attacking from behind, which caused the entire formation to collapse with the troops fleeing towards Helsingborg.Marklund (2008), pp. 206‚àí208Eriksson (2007), pp. 205‚àí209 Rantzau's disappearance from the field became noticeable in the middle of the Danish line of battle where the Swedish forces had begun to focus their attack upon. The Danes had great difficulties withstanding the assault, and as the Danish troops saw how their eastern flank was faring, the middle started to collapse due to Swedish pressure. The elite Danish household guards and a corps of grenadiers were deployed on the edges of the line of battle, and could have prevented the Swedish advance long enough to allow other forces to pull back in good order, but many of the routing troops were cut down by the Swedish cavalry through repeated charges. At this point in the battle, the Swedes attacked the gap that had formed between the Danish center and its western flank. Here too the Danes had no leadership, since their commander, von Dewitz had been ordered to move towards the eastern side of battle. The Swedish cavalry chased off the Danes present and surrounded the remaining grenadiers. The other elite force the Danes had at their disposal, the household guards, had already been forced to retire and the situation became untenable for the Danes. Danish Major-General Valentin von Eickstedt ordered a general retreat, and the Danes quickly fled from the battlefield, bringing the battle to an end.Marklund (2008), pp. 206‚àí208Eriksson (2007), pp. 205‚àí209 Aftermath The remainder of the Danish army, severely depleted from the engagement that had left them with 1,500 men killed, 3,500 men wounded and 2,677 men captured, had sought refuge within the walls of Helsingborg, and Stenbock avoided attacking them in a head-on assault as they had too advantageous a position to successfully take the city without suffering heavy casualties. Instead, he laid siege to the city and invited the Danes to capitulate, but the offer was dismissed by von Dewitz. A Swedish council of war determined that their army was too weak to storm the city, and instead started an artillery bombardment of the city. By March 5, the last remains of the Danish army left Scania after intentionally slaughtering all their horses and sabotaging their cannons by spiking them. The Danes lost over 7,500 men, who had been either killed, wounded, or captured. The Swedish losses amounted to 2,800 dead or wounded. The Danish army left Scania, never to return again. The city of Helsingborg was hit hard by the battle, due both to the Swedish bombardment which destroyed its buildings, and all the remaining human and horse cadavers poisoning the wells. A plague epidemic then harrowed the town and further reduced its population. Helsingborg did not recover until the middle of the 19th century.Marklund (2008), pp. 206‚àí208Eriksson (2007), pp. 205‚àí209 After Stenbock's victory at Helsingborg, a heroic cult began to grow around him in the Swedish Empire. He received personal congratulations from the Queen Dowager Hedvig Eleonora, Princess Ulrika Eleonora, Duke Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, King Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski and the Duke of Marlborough. Throughout the Kingdom, Stenbock's victory was celebrated with tributes, writings and artistic works, and a general thanksgiving ceremony was held on 18 March, where Stenbock's name was praised. In April, Stenbock traveled to Stockholm to inform the Privy Council about the new strategic situation. On arrival, he was hailed by the citizens of Stockholm and he held several victory speeches before the clergy and peasant estates. The Riksdag of the Estates offered him the B√•√•tska palace, and on May 21 the Privy council appointed him field marshal, sending the letter of appointment to Charles XII in Bender for the King's signature, which came shortly after. The battle marked the end of any realistic hopes for Denmark to recover the Scanian territories, and they have remained part of Sweden ever since.Marklund (2008), pp. 206‚àí208Eriksson (2007), pp. 205‚àí209 See also *Great Northern War *Battle of Helsingborg (1362) *Magnus Stenbock References Bibliography  Category:Conflicts in 1710 Helsingborg Helsingborg 1710 Helsingborg 1710 Category:1710 in Europe Category:1710s in Sweden Category:Helsingborg ","title":"Battle of Helsingborg"},{"id":"9873686","text":"Not much is known about Haedus (1427‚Äì1504), also known as Pietro Cavretto. He was a priest from the Pordenone in Friuli, and part of the circle around Gerardo di Lisa, Cimbriacus, and Iacopo Gordino. He wrote a book entitled Anterotica, sive de Amoris Generibus, which was composed for the benefit of the author's nephew, a student at Padua university. It is written in the form of a dialogue between Haedus, the poet Aemilianus Cimbriacus, who takes the position in praise of love, and the priest Antonino Filermo, who exposes all the evils and problems caused by love and passion. Haedeus sides with Filermo, and gives advice on love and sexuality. He covers passion, sexual attraction, marital relations, conduct and behaviour. He also discusses of more practical concerns such as jewellery and hairstyles. The work is prefixed by an introductory poem by Aemilianus Cimbriacus. Haedus's early work Amores, written under the influence of being rejected by his beloved, can be seen as an earlier treatment of the same subject. It was clearly popular, with later editions following in 1503 and 1607.

It also features integration with Task Scheduler and has several command line switches for scheduled automated backups.NTBackup command line Reference In Windows Vista and later operating systems, NTBackup was replaced by Windows Backup and Restore, which uses the Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) file format, supports backup to modern media such as DVDs and image-based full system backups. For server operating systems, Microsoft has replaced NTBackup with Windows Server Backup beginning with Windows Server 2008, which includes the new \`wbadmin\` command.NTBackup replaced in Windows Server 2008 This new backup application, wbadmin, no longer supports tape drives, which means that users have to install third-party applications to back up to tape on these new operating systems.

Windows XP introduced a wizard-style user interface for NTBackup in addition to the advanced UI. An expert system administrator can use the NTBackup scripting language to create a functional backup system. Scripting enables the system administrator to automate and schedule backups of files and system state, control the RSM to follow a media rotation strategy, reprogram the RSM to work with external HDD and NAS as well as tape, send email reminders to prompt users to insert the media and compile backup reports that include logs and remaining capacity. An alternative to scripting is GUI software such as BackupAssist, which automates NTBackup and can perform automatic, scheduled backups of Windows-based servers and PCs using NTBackup.

He studied medicine, and in 1943 he qualified as a surgeon and soon after was married to Susan Buxton. Susan‚Äôs deep-rooted interest in Africa after spending her early life in Belgian Congo finally pushed the move of the young Wood family, then with two children, to East Africa. They arrived at the port of Mombasa in 1946. With the help of Gerald Anderson, Michael Wood established himself as General Surgeon in East Africa. Soon he found he was regularly being called to emergencies beyond the confines of the city of Nairobi. Often he had to charter flights to remote locations where no hospitals existed. The number of these emergencies escalated and became a challenge. Mindful of what lay ahead, Michael learnt to fly. In 1954, Michael went to England on a Marks Plastic Surgery Fellowship with Archibald McIndoe . Together with Dr. Thomas Rees, an American surgeon (also a beneficiary of the Marks Plastic Surgery Fellowship), they would develop the idea of the African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) and its Flying Doctors Service. The needs for fundraising for AMREF were very demanding from the word go, which Michael Wood undertook tirelessly. This involved him taking breaks from his work in Africa to solicit funds in Europe and North America. His fundraising trips brought him into contact with famous people: the Aga Khan IV, Vice-President Richard Nixon, as well as David Rockefeller. Sister Breege Breslin, one of the Medical Missionaries of Mary who is proud to have worked with Sir Michael Wood on many occasions as his theatre nurse, said, that it was his faith and his determination to help ease a situation that made him the ‚ÄòLegend‚Äô he is. Sister Breege said during a recent interview that even after long hours of surgery with very little daylight left for him to fly back to base, Sir Michael Wood would always take the time to see one last patient. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1972 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the Bush country of Southern Kenya. In 1970, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for services to Africa and later in 1985 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. In 1986, he was given the Raoul Wallenburg Award for Humanity. Michael Wood retired from being Director General of AMREF in 1985 and soon afterwards went on to establish Farm Africa (Food and Agricultural Research Mission). In May 1987 Michael died of cancer at his home in Nairobi, Kenya.

C., takes its name. The parish was established in 1732 and the brick church still in use today dates to 1769. History =Colonial beginnings= The forerunner to The Falls Church appears to have been founded by landowner William Gunnell, who had moved from Westmoreland County, Virginia, in 1729. In the spring of 1730, he secured a minister and convened a congregation, which met in his home until 1733, when the first building was constructed. Until that time, this area was served by a clergyman who lived near present-day Quantico, and the nearest church was Pohick Church near Lorton. Known as \\"William Gunnell's Church\\", the new wooden structure was designed and built by Colonel Richard Blackburn, who was directed to construct a weatherboarded building forty feet by twenty-two feet, with a 13:12 pitch roof, and with interior work modeled on that of Pohick Church; the cost was 33,500 pounds of tobacco. Like Pohick Church, the new church served Truro Parish, which had been established by the colonial Virginia Assembly in May 1732 for the land north of the Occoquan River; Truro's first vestry met in November 1732. Michael Reagan allowed the church to be built on his land, but failed to grant the deed. John Trammell later bought the land and, in 1746, sold the two acre lot, including the church, the churchyard, and a spring, to the vestry of Truro Parish. By this point, it was known as the Upper Church. The Vestry Book first referred to it as the \\"Falls Church\\" on 28 November 1757, owing to its location at the intersection of the road to the Little Falls of the Potomac River (upstream of the Chain Bridge) and the Middle Turnpike (leading from Alexandria to Leesburg, now Virginia Route 7 or Leesburg Pike, called West Broad Street in downtown Falls Church City). George Mason was elected vestryman in 1748, as was George Washington in 1762. =The new brick church= By 1762, the wood building had fallen into decay and the vestry ordered a new brick building to be constructed on the same site. The next year, George Washington and George William Fairfax, as church wardens, assumed responsibility to contract for the new building. After 1765, this church became the seat of the new Fairfax Parish.Pohick Church, Minutes of the Vestry, Truro Parish, Virginia, 1732-1785 (Gateway Press, Baltimore, 1974), p. 58; transcription of Truro Vestry Minutes for February 19, 1749, ordering the rebuilding of the vestry house, the seat of the parish vestry, at Pohick Church in southern Fairfax County. The new church was designed by Colonel James Wren, a member of the vestry. Work commenced in 1767 and completed in late fall 1769. The Wren building remains on the site, between S. Washington, E. Broad, and E. Fairfax Streets. The 1769 structure is the oldest remaining church building north of Quantico in Virginia and is one of the oldest church structures in the United States. =Revolutionary War and aftermath= The Fairfax militia recruited from the church during the Revolutionary War, and it is said that at the war's end, the Declaration of Independence was read to citizens from the steps of the south doors. In 1784, the Commonwealth of Virginia revoked the status of the Anglican Church as state church. In 1789, The Falls Church was abandoned and remained unoccupied for almost 50 years; in 1836, it was reoccupied by an Episcopal congregation. Francis Scott Key was a lay reader of this congregation, as was Henry Fairfax, who used his own funds to restore the building during 1838 and 1839. =Civil War disruption and damage= During the American Civil War the church was used by Union troops as a hospital and later as a stable. Use of the building for worship services resumed after the war; the sanctuary has now been in continuous use since about 1873. The interior was repaired after the war, with the Federal government paying for damage caused by Union forces. Some of these repairs can be discerned in brickwork below the windows and in the lower part of the brick doorway at the west end of the church. The church was remodeled in 1908 and extensively renovated in 1959. Galleries in Wren's original design but never constructed were installed, and a new chancel was added. Other than repairs of war damage and the chancel addition, the structure reflects the original 1769 construction. Disaffiliation and church ownership issues Between 2006 and 2014 the congregation became divided on religious issues, and the buildings and property of the congregation became the subject of protracted litigation.Schjonberg, Mary Frances. Falls Church Anglicans appeal to state Supreme Court. Episcopal News Service, June 6, 2012 In December 2006, approximately 90% of the congregation voted to disaffiliate from the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (ECUSA) (a member of the Anglican Communion), and join the Convocation of Anglicans in North America (CANA). The minority group reorganized itself as The Falls Church (Episcopal), and began holding services across the street at Falls Church Presbyterian Church. The disaffiliating majority renamed itself The Falls Church (Anglican) and continued to worship at The Falls Church property, and later petitioned a local court to transfer ownership of the property to CANA. The Diocese of Virginia and the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America (ECUSA) intervened in the case and resisted the transfer. Following a series of trial court rulings and appeals, the Virginia Supreme Court affirmed a trial court decision leaving the church property in the hands of The Episcopal Church.Episcopal Church wins Virginia Supreme Court ruling The Washington Post The Episcopal parish thus returned to worshiping at the historic property, and the Anglican parish moved to a different location. In March 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by the Falls Church Anglican, ending the matter.

As a united Protestant church, it combined both Lutheran and Reformed traditions (Prussian Union). On 1 January 2009 the church body merged with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia into the Evangelical Church in Central Germany. History The Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony emerged on 1 October 1950, when the ecclesiastical province of Saxony within the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union assumed its independence as church body of its own. The history of the old-Prussian Union is tied with the history of the kingdom of Prussia. Following the second constitution of the German Democratic Republic (GDR), enacted on 9 April 1968 and accounting for its de facto transformation into a communist dictatorship, the church bodies were deprived their status as statutory bodies () and the church tax, automatically collecting parishioners' contributions as a surcharge on the income tax, was abolished. Now parishioners had to fix the level of their contributions and to transfer them again and again on their own. This together with ongoing discrimination of church members, which let many secede from the church, effectively eroded the adherence of parishioners and the financial situation of the Evangelical Church. The Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony was a full member of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD). The leader of the church was bishop Axel Noack (2006). The church had approx. 504,200 members (in December 2005) in 2,020 church parishes. The seat of the bishop was Magdeburg Cathedral. There are several former cathedrals in the territory retaining their original name, notably the Halberstadt Cathedral, the Merseburg Cathedral, the Naumburg Cathedral and Zeitz Cathedral. There are also some other imposing churches (often former collegiate churches) called \\"Dom\\" (often translated as cathedral) in the area. The Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony was a member of the Union of Evangelical Churches in Germany and the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe. In Wittenberg the church had its own academy. The Ordination of women and the blessing of same- sex unions has been allowed. Since 1 July 2004 the church was on the way to merge with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Thuringia into the Evangelical Church in Central Germany, with effect of 1 January 2009.  Area covered  The area covered by the Evangelical Church of the Church Province of Saxony was equivalent to the old Prussian Saxony province, similar to the East German state of Saxony-Anhalt (1946‚Äì1952; except of former Anhalt) and small parts of the states of Brandenburg and Thuringia.  General superintendents and bishops  The chief executive body was the consistory in Magdeburg, however, there were three more consistories with regional competence in Ro√üla (for the Lutheran church of the mediatised County of Stolberg-Rossla; 1719‚Äì1947 then merged with the following), in Stolberg at the Harz (for the Lutheran church of the mediatised County of Stolberg-Stolberg; 1553‚Äì2005, then merged into the consistory in Magdeburg) and in Wernigerode (for the Lutheran church of the mediatised County of Stolberg-Wernigerode; 1658‚Äì1930, then merged into the consistory in Magdeburg). A consistorial president chaired the consistory as an executive, as to the spiritual leadership there was one general superintendent, supported by a second and a third general superintendent (as of 1867 and 1911, respectively). Some holders of the general superintendency were royally styled as bishop, then still considered a rather non-Protestant title. In 1933 Nazi-submissive German Christians, then dominating the legislative general and provincial synods, introduced the title bishop for the spiritual leaders, including their hierarchical supremacy over other church collaborators. The title was retained also after the end of the Nazi dictatorship, however, without any hierarchical supremacy. =General superintendents till 1867= * 1802‚Äì1815: Johann Konrad Christoph Nachtigall for the Principality of Halberstadt seated in Halberstadt * 1790‚Äì1817: Karl Ludwig Nitzsch for the Saxon Electoral Circle seated in Wittenberg on the Elbe * 1823‚Äì1829: Ernst Friedrich Gabriel Ribbeck for the Governorate of Erfurt seated in Erfurt * 1812‚Äì1831: Franz Bogislaus Westermeier for the Elbe department seated in Magdeburg, styled bishop as of 1826, directing the royal consistory in Magdeburg since 1829 * 1832‚Äì1843: Johann Heinrich Bernhard Draesecke, styled bishop * 1843‚Äì1858: Johann Friedrich M√∂ller * 1858‚Äì1866: Johann Ludwig Daniel Karl Lehnerdt (1803‚Äì1866) =General superintendents, 1st office (1867‚Äì1933)= * 1867‚Äì1890: Ludwig Carl M√∂ller * 1891‚Äì1893: Leopold Schultze * 1893‚Äì1899: Ernst Adolf Friedrich Textor * 1899‚Äì1909: Karl Heinrich Vieregge * 1909‚Äì1924: Justus Julius August Jacobi (1850‚Äì1937) * 1925‚Äì1929: Otto Heinrich Meyer * 1929‚Äì1933: Johannes Eger (1873‚Äì1954) =General superintendents, 2nd office (1867‚Äì1933)= * 1867‚Äì1870: Ludwig Johann Carl Borghardt * 1871‚Äì1891: Leopold Schultze * 1891‚Äì1893: Ernst Adolf Friedrich Textor * 1894‚Äì1899: Karl Heinrich Vieregge * 1899‚Äì1906: Otto Gottlob Albin Holtzheuer (1836‚Äì1906) * 1907‚Äì1909: August Julius Justus Jacobi (1850‚Äì1937) * 1909‚Äì1933: Max Ludwig August Hermann Stolte (1863‚Äì1937), Magdeburg Cathedral preacher =General superintendents, 3rd office (1912‚Äì1933)= * 1912‚Äì1917: Paul Johannes Gennrich * 1917‚Äì1931: Johannes Ludolf Theodor Sch√∂ttler * 1931‚Äì1933: Karl Lohmann =Bishops (1933‚Äì2008)= * 1933‚Äì1936?: Friedrich Peter, bishop according to the new church laws legislated by the German Christians majority in the old-Prussian general synod on 6 September 1933 * 1936?‚Äì1947: vacancy due to the struggle of the churches with the Nazi state and Nazi-submissive church functionaries against protagonists of the Confessing Church * 1947‚Äì1955: Ludolf Hermann M√ºller * 1955‚Äì1968: Johannes J√§nicke * 1968‚Äì1983: Werner Krusche * 1983‚Äì1997: Christoph Demke * 1997‚Äì2008: Axel Noack  Synod  The election of the synod was for six years.

She was a steam turbine ship capable of 18 knots, but typically operated at 16 knots for better fuel economy. Taroona entered service in 1935 on the Bass Strait route from Melbourne to Bell Bay and Beauty Point from Melbourne to Devonport and Burnie. Taroona was requisitioned for service as a troopship in World War II by the Government of New Zealand. She carried troops from Auckland to Suva in January 1942, and in March 1942. On her return to the Bass Strait run she was almost immediately again requisitioned this time by the Government of Australia again as a troopship. During her first trip to Port Moresby she carried 480 troops and supplies; on leaving Port Moresby she ran aground on a reef at the entrance where she remained for three days, helpless hard and fast aground. All attempts to refloat her using both engines and the assistance of navy vessels proved useless. The situation became serious when on several occasions Japanese bombers swept in to attack the Seven Mile Aerodrome outside Port Moresby. Why they failed to attack Taroona remains a mystery. Finally aided by three naval vessels, she shook herself free. In her war time career she travelled 204,535 miles and carried 93,432 troops. Although frequently under fire during her ninety-four trips she remained unscathed. Taroona arrived in Sydney 4 February 1946, ending her career as an Australian troop carrier. She was handed back to Tasmanian Steamers and joined the Nairana which had maintained a very busy schedule during Taroona‚Äôs absence including transporting troops from Tasmania to Melbourne. In 1959, Taroona was replaced by the Princess of Tasmania, a ship more suitable for the times as motor cars were becoming very popular and Taroona could only take 30 which had to be winched aboard. Hellas laid up in Eleusis, July 1986 Taroona was sold to Typaldos Lines, renamed Hellas and immediately taken over by her new crew and departed Australia for Greece. She was converted to a cruise ship and operated cruises around the Mediterranean Sea until 1966 when she was laid up in Perama bay for the winter but never worked again after the sank in big seas and the Typaldos Lines was found guilty. Subsequently, all their ships were sold except SS Hellas and SS Athinai. Hellas remained laid-up at Elefsina bay until May 1989 when she was towed out of the bay to Aliaƒüa in Turkey and scrapped.

It officially claimed to have been organized just 9 days after the armistice, on November 20, 1918 in Bois, France. The group filed formal certificate of incorporation in New York state on February 13, 1919. The purposes of the corporation stated at that time included (1) To band together veterans of World War I who have served in any branch of the United States service; (2) To preserve the ideals for which these veterans served; and (3) To aid such veterans to secure adequate employment and to facilitate their return to civilian life. The group sought \\"live wire, red blooded returned servicemen\\" in its ranks.  History  The WWV established a \\"Northwestern Division\\" prior to January 1919 at a meeting held in Minneapolis. Anyone having an honorable discharge from the US or Allied powers was eligible for membership. Further articles of incorporation were filed in New York on December 12, 1919 by merging the original World War Veterans with the Rank and File Association and the Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines Protective Association of New York into one organization. The WWV does not seem to have had a constitution in its earliest phase, but was based around an organizational \\"preamble\\": > The World War Veterans are strictly non-partisan. For the love of our > country and humanity, we, returned Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines who served > in the Entente Allies during the World War, 1914-1919, are uniting ourselves > into one great fraternal organization for the mutual protection of our > rights, advancements of interests, promotion of our welfare, for the > fostering and aiding of our cordial, social, and fraternal relationship > among our members. To secure forever the blessings of Liberty, equality, > justice, and peace to ourselves and all our fellow citizens in the United > States of America. The slogan of the World War Veterans was: \\"The enforcement of the Constitution of the United States of America as it is written, and in the spirit of its founders.\\" The primary unit of the WWV was known as a \\"Post,\\" consisting of 10 or more ex-service men. Charters were obtained from state headquarters for $5, and the Post was responsible for sending per capita dues of 10 cents each month to state headquarters. Individual ex-servicemen could join as \\"members at large\\" by sending in $1 to national headquarters, including a 25 cent initiation fee and 3 months dues at 25 cents per month. From about January 1920, the group also had an Auxiliary which was open to the general public, open to anyone wishing to become a member who believed in \\"Enforcement of the Constitution of the United States as it is written.\\" The auxiliaries of the World War Veterans had three basic organizational rules: (1) No religious subjects must be discussed at meetings. (2) No political party will receive the endorsement of the group. (3) All speakers must confine their utterances within the limits as guaranteed by the constitution of the United States as it is written. All members of the regular WWV organization were to automatically be enrolled as members of the WWV Auxiliary, and the Auxiliaries were to meet on different nights than the regular WWV Post. Dues in the WWV Auxiliary were $1 per year.  Organizational Convention, Minneapolis, MN, March 31-April 1, 1921  The March‚ÄìApril 1921 convention was attended by delegates representing 22 states. In the first half of 1921, the national office of the World War Veterans was maintained at 505 Temple Court, Minneapolis, MN. Officers of the World War Veterans organization included: * National Chairman: Carl Calvin, Minneapolis. * National Secretary-Treasurer: Winfred G. Hedenberg, Minneapolis. The World War Veterans also had an \\"Eastern Division Organizer,\\" John M. Levitt of the Bridgeport Central Labor Union, Bridgeport, CT.  First National Convention, Chicago, IL, July 1‚Äì4, 1921  The July 1921 convention of the World War Veterans was attended by 48 delegates. The gathering was addressed by Raefel Mallen.

The convention drew up plans for an active campaign of organization around all parts of the US and for working with labor unions to doing away with future wars. A number of resolutions were passed by the gathering. The \\"Open Shop\\" campaign was denounced, judges issuing anti- labor injunctions were condemned, the Ku Klux Klan and racial violence was condemned. The civil war against West Virginia miners was denounced and the Non-Partisan League's industrial program for North Dakota was endorsed. Resolutions were passed calling for freedom for Ireland and for the reopening of trade relations with Soviet Russia.

Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program In July 2012, the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE) released a report identifying Woodland Hills School District having six schools among the lowest achieving schools for reading and mathematics in 2012. Woodland Hills Junior / Senior High School was among the 15% lowest achieving schools in the Commonwealth. Parents and students may be eligible for scholarships to transfer to another public or nonpublic school through the state's Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program passed in June 2012. The scholarships are limited to those students whose family's income is less than $60,000 annually, with another $12,000 allowed per dependent. Maximum scholarship award is $8,500, with special education students receiving up to $15,000 for a year's tuition. Parents pay any difference between the scholarship amount and the receiving school's tuition rate. Students may seek admission to neighboring public school districts. Each year the PDE publishes the tuition rate for each individual public school district. Fifty-three public schools in Allegheny County are among the lowest-achieving schools in 2011.

Œ£ŒùŒî (SND), lit. \\"School of Naval Cadets\\") is a military university and has the responsibility to educate and suitably train competent Naval Officers for the Hellenic Navy. Founded in 1845, the academy is one of the oldest educational institutions in Greece. The academy educates Deck and Engineering Naval cadets. It may also educate Supply Officer cadets as well as Coast Guard Officer cadets. Foreign nationals are also accepted to study as naval cadets in the academy. History The academy has a long history in naval education. Its presence is closely associated with the foundation and evolution of the Hellenic Navy, covering a period of 150 years of educational work. The Academy was founded in 1845 as a naval training school on board the corvette . For 50 years, it operated unofficially on board various combat ships, stabilizing its position and improving its work. In 1884, with the help of a French naval mission, the academy was officially reorganized by the Greek State and new facilities were built to house its operations. At the time, the academy's quarters were on board the corvette Hellas. In 1905 it was transferred to Piraeus, where it has remained ever since. The academy's base was transferred to a new and permanent installation beside the harbour of Piraeus, by the entrance of the main port. The operating conditions were greatly improved by the new quarters and this better facilitated its operation. New cadets were accepted and new Navy ships were appointed to help in the educational process. Since then, during its 150 years of operation, the Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy has evolved into one of the most prestigious institutions in Greece. More than 5,000 naval officers have graduated and led the Hellenic Navy, while many others have distinguished themselves in science, technology and politics. The organization and structure of the academy has made great reforms, always according to the needs of the Hellenic Navy. Structure The Academy's organization is divided into two main branches. The first branch deals with education and training and includes four Directorates: The Naval Cadet Administration, the Nautical and Military training, the Athletics and the Academic Studies direcrorate. The second branch is responsible of base support and everything that needs to be done for the academy's proper function. The academy is commanded by an officer of the higher naval ranks. Issues involving academic studies are examined by the Superior Educational Council, a body formed of academy professors and naval officers under the chairmanship of the Academy Superintendent. Admissions The screening procedure for the selection of new cadets is based on the established system of national examinations, undertaken by all university candidates in Greece. The Hellenic Naval Academy runs additional health, intelligence and athletic tests on its candidates. About 400 cadets study in the Academy each year. All lessons are taught in Greek and basic training lasts for 4 years. Greek nationals are admitted to the Hellenic Naval Academy following both: successful participation to the preliminary examination that includes gymnastics, physical and psychological tests and, successful participation to the annual national examinations, operated by the Ministry of Education. The number of admissions is decided by the Ministry of Defence, which issues an annual call for applications and always according to the Navy needs. Foreign nationals are selected primarily by their governments, following bilateral agreements with the Greek state. Candidates must provide confirmation, issued by their government, that they have been selected for the particular military academy and must hold a birth certificate, a health certificate and a certificate of education equivalent to the Greek Secondary Education Certificate, required for admission to any Highest Educational Institution (University) in Greece. Upon arrival, the foreign students attend one-year preparatory courses. The beginners level teaching is conducted in Arabic, English and French. During that year, students take Greek language courses, mathematics, physics and chemistry fundamental courses and undergo military training. After the preparatory year, the foreign cadets join the full academic and military 4-year course, following the same program and obligations as their Greek colleagues. The costs of education are covered by scholarships and include accommodation, tuition, training and clothing expenses, but not travel costs, to and from Greece. Education Sloop A233 of the Hellenic Naval Academy sails with a crew of naval cadet officers. The Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy offers a 4-year course. Aim of the education offered is to provide graduates (both deck officers and engineers) with adequate skills and knowledge to perform their duties as Navy Officers and keep up with evolving developments in naval science, strategy and technology of naval warfare. The day at the academy begins at 6.00 am. For five days every week the cadets attend an intense training program (academic, athletic and marine) while the afternoon is available for the rest of the academy activities as well as various cultural, athletic and social events. The academic year is divided in two semesters. During the winter term, cadets attend academic courses, professional military courses and naval training courses (off board). In addition, they receive practical courses by participating in short training voyages on various naval ships. During the Summer term, cadets of the first three classes embark for a two-month training cruise, until recently on board the training ship HN Aris and for the past few years usually on board a Frigate and a General Support Ship. The trip includes approaching at ports of various countries. Conditions for cadets to familiarize themselves with the profession and duties of an officer, are provided through instractions on professional matters, on board training and application of the theory taught, together with drills carried out during the cruise. Graduation Cadets graduate from the academy provided they have concluded successfully all years and courses (academic and practical). Upon their graduation, all naval officers are commissioned to combat units of the Hellenic Navy fleet. During the graduation ceremony the flag of the Hellenic Naval Academy, following tradition, is handed over by new Navy Officers to the 3rd year cadets. In the beginning of their career, officers serve in battle- ships and attend certain specialized schools. These schools have as goal to enhance their expertise and make them familiar with the battle-ship operations and function during peace and war. More specifically, officers are trained along the following lines: Immediately after they graduate, officers attend a four to six-month school where they receive additional theoretical and practical training and learn about system and equipment of their appointed battle-ships, as well as their duties as officers on those ships. During the first stages of their career, officers may also choose to serve in submarines, helicopters, marine patrol aircraft and underwater demolition (Special Forces), after being trained in their respective training schools. Furthermore, when promoted to Lieutenant Junior Grade, they go through a training stage lasting nine to eleven months. There they follow training held by various specialization departments of the Navy. According to the department they choose (or are appointed according to Navy needs), they take a degree of specialization to one of the following subjects: gunnery, navigation, communications and electronic engineering. Lieutenant officers attend the Navy Staff Officers School and the Naval War School for 3 to 4 months on each school, where they obtain a Staff Officer degree. An officer may then serve as staff officer in various departments of the Hellenic Navy. Finally, officers ranked Lieutenant Junior Grade and Lieutenant, may be educated abroad (in Europe or in the United States) in schools such as NPS, MIT, the University of Michigan etc., thus becoming further specialized in fields such as electronics, weapon systems, computers, operation research, marine architecture etc. References * Hellenic Naval Cadets Academy website External links * Academy Homepage Category:Educational institutions established in 1845 Category:Naval units and formations of Greece Category:Naval academies Category:Commander's Crosses of the Cross of Valour (Greece) Category:1845 establishments in Greece Category:Education in Greece ","title":"Hellenic Naval Academy"},{"id":"9874072","text":"Hesketh Bank railway station was on the West Lancashire Railway in England.

She was of the Papyeong Yun clan. She was regent for her son King Myeongjong when he was still too young to rule by himself until 1565. Known as a good administrator, she continued to rule even after he reached the age of maturity. She gave out the land to common people who had been formerly owned by the nobility. It was only after her death that her son took over power. She was given the posthumous title Seongryeol Inmyeong Munjeong Wanghu (ÏÑ±Î†¨Ïù∏Î™ÖÎ¨∏Ï†ïÏôïÌõÑ, ËÅñÁÉà‰ªÅÊòéÊñáÂÆöÁéãÂêé). Rise to Power According to unofficial chronicles, there is a tale of Munjeong finally showing love for her \\"adoptive\\" son King Injong, after decades of polite indifference (in reality behind-the-scenes hatred). As Injong went to pay his morning respects, Munjeong‚Äôs face started radiating with a smile only a mother could give to her child. Injong took it as a sign that the Queen Mother was finally acknowledging him as the king, and in particular as her own son. He ate the ddeok that his step-mother gave him, not knowing that it would be the beginning of the end. He fell ill slowly, not enough to create any suspicion, but quickly enough that historians would later pick up on the event. Three days passed before Injong mysteriously died (after only 9 months of rule). Queen Munjong‚Äôs son became King Myeongjong, while Munjeong became Queen Regent. The chronicles also tell that Munjeong was frequently visited by spirits at night after Injong‚Äôs death.According to the chronicles the spirit is supposedly Injong, screaming with grief at the woman who could never be a mother to him even in death. So disturbed was she that she moved her residence from Gyeongbok Palace to Changdeok Palace. Revival of Buddhism Munjeong was the most influential supporter of Buddhism during the early dynasty; indeed, she lifted the official ban on Buddhist worship and instigated an impressive revival of Buddhism. Two proofs of her strong support of Buddhism still exist. =Buddhist Paintings= During the time her son (the Royal Prince) fell ill, and at the same time her failure to produce another son, her concerns motivated her to order 400 Buddhist artworks (50 of which are in supplication for the recovery of the Royal Prince and the birth of another son). Also, the aim of the commission was to commemorate the opening of Hoeam Temple.A prominent Seon (Chinese: Chan; Japanese: Zen) Buddhist temple, in Yangju, Gyeonggi Province. The project was started in 1563 and was completed 2 years later. Unfortunately, the Royal Prince died before the commission's completion. The massive commission involved 100 scrolls on each of 4 triads: * The Historical Buddha Triad (Sanskrit: ‡§∂‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•Å‡§®‡§ø ≈öƒÅkyamuni; Korean: ÏÑùÍ∞ÄÎ™®Îãà/ÏÑùÍ∞Ä seokgamoni/seokga) * The Buddha of the Western Paradise Triad (‡§Ö‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§≠ AmitƒÅbha; ÏïÑÎØ∏ÌÉÄÎ∂à amitabul) * The Buddha of the Future Triad (‡§Æ‡•à‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§Ø Maitreya; ÎØ∏Î•µÎ≥¥ÏÇ¥ mireukbosal) * The Medicine Buddha Triad (‡§≠‡•à‡§∑‡§ú‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å Bhai·π£ajyaguru; ÏïΩÏÇ¨Ïó¨Îûò/ÏïΩÏÇ¨Î∂à yaksayeorae/yaksabul) In each set of 100, 50 were executed in colors and gold, the other 50 in gold only. As of 2009,http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=45,7655,0,0,1,0 only 6 of the commissioned 400 are still extant. *1 painting in the Sakyamuni Triad ‚Äì made in 1565, formerly belonging to the Hoeam Temple, discovered in Japan (in excellent conditionThe engraved golden painting's provenance at the bottom of the painting still exists.), and purchased and kept by the Mary Jackson Burke Collection in 1990 in New York. The painting is considered by experts in the field and in the Buddhist community to be one of the most important and representative Buddhist artworks produced during the Dynasty.Buddhist art is rare as the state ideal was Neo-Confucianism. *1 painting in the Bhaisajyaguru Triad ‚Äì currently on display at the National Museum of Korea. *4 paintings are in Japan. **1 painting in the Sakyamuni Triad **3 paintings in the Bhaisajyaguru Triad =Buddhist temples= Buddhist temples served as another proof of Munjeong's zealous aim of the revival of Buddhism. The cornerstone of the revival of Buddhism is the Bongeun-sa Temple (a major center of Zen Buddhism). Bongeun-sa\\"Offering Benefit\\" was established in 794 by Ven. Yeon- hoe,The National Master Monk of Unified Silla at that time. and was originally called Gyeonseong-sa.\\"Seeing True Nature\\" It was rebuilt in 1498 (by Queen Jeonghyeon's patronage) and renamed Bongeun-sa; in 1562 it was moved about 1 km to its current location and rebuilt. Its fate was destruction by fire (1592 and 1637) and repetitive rebuilding and renovations (1637, 1692, 1912, 1941, and 1981). A three-story stone stupa enshrines the Sari of Sakyamuni Buddha, brought from Sri Lanka in 1975. The temple fell into decline during the late Goryeo era, but was reconstructed in 1498. Before the reconstruction, Buddhism fell under severe state-imposed oppression as the government maintained Neo- Confucianism as the sole state ideal. With Munjeong's strong support for the re-awakening of Buddhism, she reconstructed Bongeun-sa and it was to become a cornerstone for early-Joseon Buddhist revival. Ven. Bo-woo played a key role at this critical period, having been assigned as the Chief Monk of Bongeun-sa in 1548. He revived an official system of training and selecting monks in both the Seon (meditation) and Gyo (doctrinal, scholastic) sects of Korean Buddhism.First established by National Master-Monk Jinul Bojo-guksa in the 13th century. In 1551, Bongeun-sa became the main temple of the Jogye Seon Order, then soon became the main base for the overall restoration of Korean Buddhism. This revived training system produced such illustrious monks as Ven. Seo-san, Ven. Sa-myeong, and Ven. Byeok-am. However, after Munjeong died, Ven. Bo-woo was killed by anti-Buddhist officials.

He was with the Daily Mail for nearly 50 years. Biography Born in New Milton, Hampshire, Wooldridge left Brockenhurst Grammar School with two school certificates, for English and art.Ian Wooldridge ‚Äì Obituaries, News ‚Äì Independent.co.uk After National Service and an apprenticeship on newspapers in New Milton and Bournemouth, he became a reporter on the News Chronicle in 1956. After a spell with the Sunday Dispatch, he moved to the Daily Mail, which absorbed the News Chronicle in 1960. =Early Fleet Street career= Initially a cricket correspondent at the Mail, from 1972 Wooldridge wrote a weekly column which spread to other sports. He covered 10 Olympic Games, including the Sarajevo Winter Olympics in 1984. Writing before those games, he predicted a tragedy, but changed his mind after being there, saying they were amongst the best he had ever seen. He covered the Munich Olympics in 1972, and caused resentment among British runners with a brutish and insensitive attack on David Bedford; it emerged that he had had to take some ribbing from foreign journalists over Bedford's failure in the 10,000 metres. As well as the Olympics, Wooldridge covered Wimbledon tennis championships, heavyweight boxing world title bouts, football World Cups, Open and US Masters golf championships and America's Cups for the paper. His America's Cup reporting opened the sport to a wide audience beyond sailing enthusiasts. He was assisted by PR and friend David Redfern, of whom he said \\"with his help, the eyes of Coronation Street as well as the Squadron are on the Cup\\", but in reality it was Wooldridge's writing and interest that was the key. The last Olympics he covered was in Sydney in 2000. He branched into other areas, writing on a revolution in Portugal, flying with the RAF's Red Arrows, riding the Cresta Run, sparring with Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, and running the bulls at Pamplona. Wooldridge was newspaper columnist of the year twice, sportswriter of the year five times and sports feature writer of the year four times. His first job had been on the New Milton Advertiser, covering the funeral of a coal merchant; he intercepted every mourner to write down his or her name ‚Äì holding up the interment by more than half an hour. According to his obituary in The Daily Telegraph, Wooldridge was sent to Alaska to cover the 1,100-mile dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome, travelling with a photographer in a one-engine aircraft steered by an old bush pilot. \\"You slept where you could\\", Wooldridge later recalled. \\"In trappers' huts with bare wire bedsteads to sleep on, cooking up horsemeat over a fire... We stayed with Eskimo families, Indian families ‚Äì there were no hotels.\\" Wooldridge ghosted a syndicated column for golfer Max Faulkner. Once, needing a good anecdote about Faulkner's Open success, he invented a story about the golfer just before he had teed off in the final round: Faulkner, he wrote, had scrawled \\"Open Champion 1949\\" on a ball which he handed to a young autograph hunter. Years later Wooldridge met American writer George Plimpton, who had come across the story. \\"Great tale\\", said Plimpton admiringly. \\"Total nonsense\\", Wooldridge replied. =Television career= Wooldridge made over 120 documentaries for various broadcasters, including the BBC. Titles of these include: Wooldridge on Whiskey; In the Highest Tradition; The Great Fishing Race; Behind the Lines; Trooping the Colour; and The British Challenge for the America's Cup 1983. His heyday was during the late 1970s and early 1980s. He also did a lot of voiceovers, most memorably for the British Gas advert that involved a baby swimming under water. =Opposition to apartheid= Wooldridge was an anti- apartheid advocate, supporting sportswriter John Arlott at the Cambridge Union in 1969 in speaking against sport with South Africa. His opposition dated from his first cricket tour to South Africa. During the Port Elizabeth Test match, black South Africans were not only refused entry but beaten up by police. Because of problems with telephones, Wooldridge had to contact his London office from the committee room. Frank Keating, in The Guardian, recalled: \\"He had written his piece; now he had to read it at the top of his voice in the presence of about 30 hard-faced members of the republic's ruling broederband... as all 30 pairs of ears listened in the chilly, unwelcoming atmosphere, he took a deep breath and dictated: 'The wretchedly awful face of apartheid was displayed here today when...'\\" Awards In the British Press Awards he was Columnist of the Year in 1975 and 1976; and Sportswriter of the Year in 1972, 1974, 1981 and 1989. The Sports Journalists' Association made him Sportswriter of the Year for 1986, 1987 and 1995; and it chose him as Sports Feature Writer of the Year in 1990 and 1996. As Alan Sugar remarked during a libel action against the Daily Mail, journalists' awards were decided by fellow journalists and \\"were like a lot of thieves deciding who pulled off the best bank job of the year.\\" In May 2006, he won the London Press Club's Edgar Wallace award for outstanding reporting. The Press Club's chairman, Donald Trelford, described Wooldridge as \\"more than just a sports writer, he is a journalist of the highest calibre and a master of the written word\\". Death and legacy Wooldridge died from cancer. His memorial service was at the Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks, London on Wednesday 27 July 2007.The Daily Telegraph, Court & Social page (p26) 27 June 2007 Hugh McIlvanney, in The Sunday Times, wrote: > It is an honour to have worked in the same era as Ian Wooldridge, a precious > privilege to have known him as a friend for more than 40 years. Though he > would have snorted at the suggestion, he repeatedly pulled off the minor > miracle of making our way of getting a living seem like a proper job for a > grown-up person.

The club currently competes in the Football League, the third tier of the Greek football league system. History =Formation= The club was formed in 1963 from the merger of two rival Trikala football clubs, Achilleas of Trikala and Œë.Œï.Œ§. The history of these original clubs can be traced back to the early 1920s when football in the town was starting to rise. The merger provided an optimistic spirit for the fans of the team since the town's best teams had been merged. Consequently, it proved to be successful as within a year, A.O.T. had won promotion to the Greek first division. =Progress= After coming top in the Greek 2nd division (Beta Ethniki) in 1964, AOT continued its early success by competing in the Greek 1st division (Alpha Ethniki) from 1964 to 1969 (except for the 1967‚Äì68 season when they were relegated to the 2nd division only to come top of that division and be promoted straight away). AOT then spent a further two years in the 2nd division before winning that league again in 1971 and being promoted. They spent a further two years in the 1st division before being relegated to the second division in 1973. The team spent a further 10 years in the second division and eventually got relegated to the third division (Gamma Ethniki) in 1983. The period between 1983 and 1995 was one of the team's worse, spending 7 of the next 12 years in the 3rd division. In 1995 AOT re-established themselves in the 2nd division and that success was followed four years later when they won the league and were promoted to the 1st division in 1999 after a 27-year absence. Unfortunately, the success was short lived as AOT came last in the 1999‚Äì00 season which was followed by a disastrous run culminating in their relegation to the 4th division in 2003. Since 2003 the team have been playing in the Greek 3rd and 4th division until their promotion to the Greek second division in 2010 (Beta Ethniki) after a 9-year absence. =2009‚Äì10 season= The most recent season was a particularly memorable one and the most successful season for AOT in a decade. Having won promotion from the Greek 4th Division, AO Trikala were to compete in the Greek National 3d Division North Group. They signed many good and experienced players and set their sights on promotion. The club started the season with a great performance in the Greek Cup as they eliminated Kastoria and went on to play fierce local rivals Anagennisi Karditsas at home. A crowd of over 7,500 Trikala fans saw the home team beat their rivals 1‚Äì0, with the goalscorer being Dimosthenis Manousakis. In the 4th round Trikala had another memorable game when they beat top-flight club Iraklis Salonica in front of over 7,000 home fans. They eventually lost on penalties in the next round having progressed to the last 16 of the competition. Despite the good run in the Greek Cup, the team's league performance at the start of the season suffered as their inability to score away from home meant that Trikala dropped a lot of points. But a 9-game streak of consecutive victories in the end of the season meant that Trikala achieved a second-place finish place, which qualified them for a playoff match against the runners-up of the division. The playoff match was played on May 29, at the Nea Smirni Stadium in Athens. More than 4000 Trikala fans travelled 7 hours to watch their team produce a memorable display and beat Vyzas Megaron by 2‚Äì0, with Costa Rican striker Enoc Perez netting both goals. It was a happy end to the season as AO Trikala had finally started to form a team worthy of its bright history. The 2009‚Äì10 season also saw AO Trikala breaking some impressive records. The team conceded just 11 goals in 35 league games (including the playoff match), which was a European record for the season. Trikala also finished with an impressive home record of 12 wins, 2 draws and 0 losses, while having conceded only 2 goals (a penalty and an own goal). Trikala also were the most attended team in the division, with attendances regularly rising over 4,000. =2010‚Äì2013= The team enjoyed on pitch success in the 2010‚Äì11 season at the second tier football league finishing the league in fourth place and becoming eligible for the promotion playoffs to the top tier Super League. The team never had the opportunity to participate in the playoffs as it was disqualified after it emerged that the team had produced counterfeit bank guarantees to prove the team's financial viability. The bank guarantees were a prerequisite for a license to be granted from EPO. The repercussions from the false guarantees did not end there, as the team was relegated to the lowest tier of the Greek football Delta Ethniki. After further investigations which uncovered extensive irregularities and undeclared debts, the team was expelled from D-Ethniki into non league football. This prompted an angry response from fans towards controversial owner Vangelis Plexidas who the fans held responsible for the predicament of the team. In 2012 the official supporters of the club named SAKAFLIADES take charges the reborn of the team. The team is going to play in the next to last category of Greek football championships in 2013‚Äì14. Stadium The Trikala Stadium was built in 1950 and it has a horseshoe-like shape, with no stand behind the west goal. It has a main south stand, which is covered by a roof. The stadium upgraded in 2003, as in that year it hosted the Tsiklitria international athletics Grand Prix. The Record of Attendance is 20,000 in a 1999 match against PAS Giannina. It is the home stadium of Trikala F.C. and hosts other events such as concerts and athletics.  Crest and colours  = Crest = The original design of the Trikala F.C. logo represents the merger of the two local rival football teams, Achilleas Trikalon and A.E.T. It was the merger of which Trikala F.C. was established. Since then the crest has changed several times but the original 'Merger Bond' is still featured. In 2009, the chairman Vaggelis Plexidas asked for a new crest so the design resembles the crest of FC Barcelona since the team's main colours are red and blue. = Colours = Team's main colours are blue and red. Support The club is considered by the most popular provincial because of its past, as well as the high average attendance of viewers per meeting. When he successfully fought in the three highest national categories, there were a record of thousands of fans in the stadiums, with AOT vs Panathinaikos 1‚Äì2 being the absolute winner on March 12, 1972 (8 months after the final of European Cup at Wembley) 18,231 tickets were available, while the viewers were certainly much more. Unsurprisingly, however, the turnout record occurred in 1999 in the match against PAS Giannina where 20,000 spectators attended. But even when the team was in the Regional Championship, there were meetings that numbered thousands of people. Historically, AOT's first organized association of supporters was the Fan Association AO Trikala \\"Door 4\\". Now, it has been renamed to a Fan Club Association - \\"Sakafliades\\" with a dynamic presence and action on several levels. The precursor of Sakafliades was the unofficial link of the Hobo Boys, who first organized and created a warm atmosphere in AOT matches.

Design and development Designed primarily as a coaxial machine gun by the Rock Island Arsenal and produced by General Electric, the M73 was developed as a replacement for the M1919A4E1, M1919A5, and M37 machine guns that continued to serve in the immediate post‚ÄìWorld War II environment. The Machine Gun, 7.62-MM, M73 was officially adopted in 1959. It is an air-cooled, recoil- operated machine gun, but also using cartridge gasses to boost recoil. Though designed as a simplified alternative to the M1919 series, it is of almost identical weight. The weapon is fitted with a quick-change barrel, pull-chain charging assembly, and can be made to feed from the left or the right hand side (though the left-hand feed is more common). An attempt to make the M73 useful as a flexible infantry gun saw the weapon fitted with sights and a pistol grip trigger as the Machine Gun, 7.62-MM, M73C. Equally unpopular, very few of these weapons were produced. Sources claim that it saw limited use in Vietnam.Ezell, 1988. p. 418 The M73 suffered from numerous malfunctions and was prone to jamming.

It was originally bored for the Llanpumsaint-Pencader section of the Carmarthen & Cardigan (C&C;) Railway. It is approximately long (just over half-a-mile), making it the longest tunnel in West Wales and is bored through Ordovician shales. It is single-track and built to the C&C;'s adopted broad gauge dimensions, as opposed to the smaller standard gauge used on Britain's railways today. It is also known as alternatively Alltwalis Tunnel and Dolgran Tunnel to local villagers.  History  From the first proposals of the Carmarthen and Cardigan railway it was known that an expensive and long tunnel would be needed to take the line between the valleys of Skanda Vale (in which Llanpumpsaint station resided) and Dolgran, under the Brechfa Forest watershed. Several separate Engineers surveyed the line, including Isambard Kingdom Brunel, with varying schemes. Brunel proposed a dead-straight tunnel to connect the valleys, though after reworking, the final design was longer in order to ease the gradients. As built, the tunnel was approximately long, curving slightly from the southern portal in Skanda Vale, running straight for most of its length and then curving for the final third into Dolgran. The digging would require two construction shafts which could then be used for ventilation. Construction started in the spring of 1857 to bore the tunnel at the same time as work began on the first stage of the railway line in the town of Carmarthen. During construction in 1859, the C&C; railway attempted to switch from broad gauge to standard gauge, which would have meant all railway infrastructure (including the tunnel), could be built to smaller (and thus cheaper) dimensions. Such a change would require the approval of the British Parliament and pressurisation on the company by the South Wales Railway, a broad gauge line in the area which did not want the rival standard gauge making an incursion on its territory, meant the application to Parliament never occurred. Digging initially proceeded from four sites - at either end and from the bottom of the first ventilation shaft sunk. Once the second shaft was finished, digging also commenced from there, though this had been abandoned by May 1860 according to a report which stated that had been dug by this time, approximately two-thirds of the full length. Work was expected to be finished by December 1860/January 1861. As it stood, the tunnel was only 'finished' in March 1861 although, at the time, it was exposed rock without a brick lining and required further work to complete it. The long approach cuttings were also unfinished at this time. During construction of the tunnel, many of the horses used to haul away excavated rock died from disease and were buried in the field surrounding the northern of the two shafts. The same field also has grassed-over rubble remaining from cottages built by the construction navvies. Much of the spoil excavated was used to build embankments north and south of the tunnel but large spoil heaps can be seen on the hillsides around both ventilation shafts. Further delays were caused by the original contractor for the railway, Jays of London, abandoning the construction of the line in autumn 1861. By November, however, another contractor, Holdens, had taken over the task. Work was focused on finishing several miles of railway either side of the tunnel and, although easy to the north, to the south, heavy engineering of cuttings and embankments slowed the work. Track is known to have been laid through the tunnel at some point prior to December 1863, as a company report mentions an accident in that month on a ballast train en route to Pencader, beyond the tunnel. Official government inspection was carried out in January 1864 and the tunnel opened with the rest of the Llanpumsaint-Pencader section of the line on 1 April 1864. At the time, the tunnel was still unlined and a watchman was employed to inspect the tunnel for any rockfalls, until it was eventually lined with brick some years later. By the time the tunnel was finished, having taken four years to build and a further three to complete the railway approaches to it, the project had crippled the finances of the Carmarthen to Cardigan Railway, which soon went into receivership. After the railway was closed to freight traffic on 28 September 1973, the track was removed. The tunnel was not demolished and remains in place.

Biography Maria Anna was born in Palazzo Colonna in Rome, the daughter of King Victor Emmanuel I of Sardinia and of his wife, Archduchess Maria Teresa of Austria-Este. She had a twin sister Maria Teresa. The two princesses were baptised by Pope Pius VII. Their godparents were their maternal grandparents, Archduke Ferdinand of Austria- Este and his wife Maria Beatrice Ricciarda d'Este. In the Museo di Roma can be seen a painting of the baptism.

It is located west of Fortuna, North Dakota. It was closed in 1979 as a radar station, remaining as a Long-Range Radar (LRR) facility until 1984. Fortuna Air Force Station was part of the last batch of twenty-three radar stations constructed as part of the Air Defense Command permanent network. It was activated in April, and declared completely operational in late 1952. History The 780th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) began operations using AN/FPS-3 search and AN/FPS-4 height-finder radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-control intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. During 1957 an AN/GPS-3 search radar made a brief appearance. Reportedly, an AN/TPS-10D was also briefly used. In 1958 the 780th began operating an AN/FPS-20A search radar that replaced the AN/GPS-3. By 1960 a pair of AN/FPS-6, -6A handled height-finder chores. During 1961 Fortuna AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-20 at Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 780th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 August 1961.Cornett, & Johnson, p. 168 The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. Fortuna was incorporated into BUIC I, a manual back-up interceptor control system implemented in 1962. BUIC I provided limited command and control capability in the event the SAGE system was disabled. In 1963, the AN/FPS-20A was removed, and the makeup of the radars at Fortuna consisted of an AN/FPS-35 search radar along with AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-90 height-finder radars. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-27. The FPS-35 tower was located 6.6 miles from the U.S./Canada border and 8.3 miles from the North Dakota/Montana border. In 1964 an AN/FPS-26A height-finder radar was installed, and the AN/FPS-6 was retired. In the winter of 1964, a fierce wind storm blew over the AN/FPS-35 sail; the sail was not replaced until the following year (by the one formerly installed at Manassas Air Force Station, Virginia, reportedly). For the interim, in 1965 an AN/FPS-64 search radar was installed in the former AN/FPS-20A tower; it was removed in 1967 after the AN/FPS-35 was again fully operational. The AN/FPS-90 height-finder radar was removed in 1969. Work proceeded on the installation of BUIC II in 1966, after the installation of a Burroughs CSA-51 computer system, In 1969 it became a BUIC III site. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The 780th Radar Sq was inactivated and replaced by the 780th Air Defense Group in March 1970.Cornett, & Johnson, p.86 The upgrade to group status was done because of Fortuna AFS' status as a Backup Interceptor Control (BUIC) site. BUIC sites were alternate control sites in the event that SAGE Direction Centers became disabled and unable to control interceptor aircraft. The group was inactivated and replaced by the 780th Radar Squadron. as defenses against manned bombers were reduced. The group was disbanded in 1984.Department of the Air Force/MPM Letter 575q, 27 Sep 1984, Subject: Disbandment of Units Normal operations continued until 1979 when Aerospace Defense Command was inactivated in September and the radar station was inactivated. The GATR site (R-27) was retained until the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) switchover, c. 1984. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) opened an unmanned ARSR-4 radar facility about halfway between Sidney, Montana, and Watford City, North Dakota, (just off of Highway 68) before the Fortuna radars were finally decommissioned in 1984.  Current use  The station was bought by private investors that stripped the site of anything of value and sold it off. After this \\"salvage\\", the site was forfeited to Divide County over a valuation dispute, and now sits half-demolished, useless as a facility, and abandoned. An environmental impact study is currently planned as a precursor to a possible land reclamation effort. The main tower is now housing a operating cell tower. Historical signage was erected a couple years back with a pull off on Highway 5 by the county. All buildings but the main radar building have been removed.  Buildings and facilities  Buildings on the station include: ; Recreational Services : Gymnasium, tennis courts, 2-lane bowling alley, horseshoe pits ; Motor Pool ; Headquarters Building : Library ; Dining Hall ; Medical Aid Station ; Base Housing : 45 houses : 3 dormitories : NCO dorm : 6 BOQ (Bachelor Officer Quarters) units : trailer court (30 units, reduced to 20 in 1974) ; Officer's Lounge (\\"Hilltop Inn\\") ; NCO Open Mess ; Radar Towers (FPS-35, FPS-26 w/radome, one inactive) ; Power Plant ; Dental Clinic ; Base Exchange ; Auto Hobby Shop ; Base Theater/Post Office The Ground to Air Transmitter-Receiver (GATR) facility was located off-station at , roughly one mile south of the main station.

The pilot of the respective naval aircraft is required to destroy enemies to clear stages. It was released by Taito Corporation in 1985 for video arcades as well as for the Family Computer. Gameplay The player is about to destroy a submarine. The player's plane is equipped with machine guns and torpedoes and ammunition is unlimited. The colour of the sky changes according to the time of the day (afternoon, evening, night). F6F Hellcats (F4U Corsairs in the Arcade Version) are common enemy fighter planes the player will encounter. Occasionally, the player would run into a B-24 bomber and has to shoot each of its four engines before the B-24 flies away. Sometimes when player has shot down a number of B-24s, they would encounter a falling satellite across the screen. A high number of points would be rewarded if the satellite gets destroyed. There are bonus stages in this game. Enemy resistance comes not only from the air, but from land and sea as well. Sometimes, an American naval destroyer or submarine would try to down the player's plane with anti-aircraft fire. Aircraft carriers can sometimes be seen in the distant horizon (but can still be sunk with torpedoes). At the end of a stage, the player faces a mobile shore battery on an island. This battery must be destroyed in order to complete the mission. If the player is hit even just once by enemy fire, his plane crashes and he loses one life point.Sky Destroyer at MobyGames The game is over when all life points are used up. Sky Invader Sky Invader screenshot A hacked version of this game made by Inventor is known as Sky Invader. The differences between the original and the hacked version are: *Different title screen. *Different music. *Different planes (both the player's and the enemies are modified). *The sky is pink. *The water color is different. *The player starts with nine airplanes instead of three. *The stages are called \\"WAR\\".  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Sky Destroyer on their December 15, 1985 issue as being the third most- successful table arcade unit of the year.

The battle was part of the Second Italian War and was fought at the town of Ruvo in the Province of Bari, modern-day Italy. The result was a Spanish victory. Background Following the Treaty of Granada signed on 11 November 1500, Spanish monarch Ferdinand the Catholic and Louis XII of France agreed that each power takes a partition of the Kingdom of Naples. The deal soon fell through, however, and Spain and France resumed their war over the kingdom. This resulted in the Second Italian War. Battle During the end of 1502 and the early part of 1503 the Spanish stood at bay in the entrenched camp at Barletta near the Ofanto river on the shores of the Adriatic sea. Upon hearing about the retreat and departure of Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours, Gonzalo decided to launch an offensive in a Moorish guerrilla style on the town of Ruvo which was defended by Jacques de la Palice. Gonzalo de C√≥rdoba stormed the town at early morning launching a cannonade offensive. Soon after, he faced a resolute resistance by the French. However, within four hours he opened a breach from where the Spanish soldiers could enter and launch the assault. Fighting with swords lasted for seven hours and reached houses and streets until Jacques de la Palice was wounded and held prisoner.Historia militar de Espa√±a - Asalto a Ruvo (Primavera de 1503) The Spanish army soon decided to get back to Barletta while Louis d'Armagnac tried to return to Ruvo to help the French army.

Function  Chromosomal segregation during mitosis as well as meiosis is regulated by kinases and phosphatases. The Aurora kinases associate with microtubules during chromosome movement and segregation. Aurora kinase B localizes to microtubules near kinetochores, specifically to the specialized microtubules called K-fibers, and Aurora kinase A (MIM 603072) localizes to centrosomes (Lampson et al., 2004).[supplied by OMIM] In cancerous cells, over-expression of these enzymes causes unequal distribution of genetic information, creating aneuploid cells, a hallmark of cancer.  Discovery  In 1998, Aurora kinase B was identified in humans by a polymerase chain reaction screen for kinases that are overexpressed in cancers. In the same year, rat Aurora kinase B was identified in a screen designed to find kinases that altered S. cerevisiae proliferation when overexpressed. Expression and subcellular localization Aurora B kinase (in green) localizes in a cell cycle dependent manner. (DNA is in blue) The expression and activity of Aurora B are regulated according to the cell cycle. Expression of Aurora B reaches a maximum at the G2-M transition, whereas Aurora B protein is most active during mitosis. Aurora B is a chromosomal passenger protein. Specifically, Aurora B localizes to the chromosomes in prophase, the centromere in prometaphase and metaphase, and the central mitotic spindle in anaphase. This localization has been determined by indirect immunofluorescence in mammalian, C. elegans, and Drosophila cells. A more detailed analysis of Aurora B localization has been carried out in mammalian cells by tagging Aurora B with green fluorescent protein. This analysis showed that the association of Aurora B with centromeres is dynamic (Aurora B at the centromere is constantly exchanging with a pool of cytoplasmic Aurora B). The analysis of tagged Aurora B also suggested that it associates with spindle microtubules during anaphase of mitosis and this association significantly limits its mobility. Finally, a portion of the tagged Aurora B localized to the equatorial cell cortex, having been transported to this location by astral microtubules. Regulation of Aurora B Aurora B complexes with three other proteins, Survivin, Borealin and INCENP. Each of the four components of the complex is required for the proper localization and function of the other three. INCENP stimulates Aurora B kinase activity. Survivin might do the same. Localization of Aurora B to the centromere during prometaphase and metaphase requires phosphorylation of the mammalian kinetochore-specific histone-H3 variant centromere protein A (CENP-A). CENP-A associates with the centromere and is necessary for assembly of the kinetochore. Phosphorylation of CENP-A at serine 7 by Aurora A kinase recruits Aurora B to the centromere. Aurora B, itself, can also phosphorylate CENP-A at the same residue once it is recruited (see below). Additionally, topoisomerase II has been implicated in the regulation of Aurora B localization and enzymatic activity. This regulatory role may be directly associated with the role of topoisomerase II in disjoining sister chromatids prior to anaphase. In topoisomerase II-depleted cells, Aurora B and INCENP do not transfer to the central spindle in late mitosis. Instead, they remain tightly associated with the centromeres of non-disjoined sister chromatids. Also, cells deficient in topoisomerase II show significantly reduced Aurora B kinase activity. Inhibition of Aurora B due to loss of topoisomerase II seems to depend on BubR1 activity (see below). Aurora B has been shown to bind to end-binding protein 1 (EB1), a protein that regulates microtubule dynamics. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that Aurora B and EB1 colocalize during anaphase on the central spindle and in the midbody during cytokinesis. Intriguingly, EB1 overexpression enhances Aurora B kinase activity, at least in part because EB1 blocks the dephosphorylation/inactivation of Aurora B by protein phosphatase 2A. Role in chromosome biorientation Studies in several organisms indicate that Aurora B oversees chromosome biorientation by ensuring that appropriate connections are made between spindle microtubules and kinetochores. Inhibition of Aurora B function by RNA interference or microinjection of blocking antibodies impairs the alignment of chromosomes at the equator of the mitotic spindle. This process of alignment is referred to as chromosome congression. The reason for this defect is a subject of ongoing study. Aurora B inhibition may lead to an increase in the number of syntelic attachments (sister chromatid pairs in which both sister kinetochores are attached to microtubules radiating from the same spindle pole). Intriguingly, expression of a dominant-negative and catalytically inactive form of Aurora B disrupted microtuble attachment to the kinetochore and prevented the association of dynein and centromere protein E (CENP-E) with kinetochores. Numerous kinetochore targets of Aurora kinases have been determined in organisms ranging from yeast to man. Most notably, CENP-A is a target of Aurora B. The phosphorylation of CENP-A by Aurora B reaches a maximum in prometaphase. In fact, Aurora A targets the same CENP-A phosphorylation site as Aurora B, and CENP-A phosphorylation by Aurora A is thought to precede that by Aurora B. Thus, a model has been proposed in which CENP-A phosphorylation by Aurora A recruits Aurora B to the centromere, the latter maintaining the phosphorylation state of CENP-A in a positive feedback loop. Oddly, mutation of this phosphorylation site in CENP-A leads to defects in cytokinesis. Aurora B also interacts with mitotic centromere-associated kinesin (MCAK). Both Aurora B and MCAK localize to the inner centromere during prometaphase. Aurora B has been shown to recruit MCAK to the centromere and directly phosphorylate MCAK on various residues. Phosphorylation of MCAK by Aurora B limits the ability of MCAK to depolymerize microtubules. Importantly, inhibition of MCAK by a number of approaches leads to improper attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules. It has been hypothesized that tension generated by amphitelic attachment (biorientation; the attachment of sister kinetochores to opposite spindle poles) pulls sister kinetochores apart, thus disrupting the interaction of Aurora B at the innermost portion of the centromere with microtubule binding sites on the fibrous corona of the outermost centromere. Specifically, the tension generated by biorientation pulls MCAK outside of the area of Aurora B localization. Thus, mitosis proceeds upon biorientation and dissociation of Aurora B from its substrates. Role in chromosome condensation and chromosome cohesion Aurora B is responsible for phosphorylation of histone-H3 on serine 10 during mitosis. This modification is conserved from yeast (where the kinase is known as Ipl1) to man. Notably, histone-H3 phosphorylation by Aurora B seems not to be responsible for chromatin condensation. Though Aurora B is enriched at centromeres, it localizes diffusely to all chromatin. In Drosophila cells, Aurora B depletion disrupts chromosome structure and compaction. In these cells, the condensin complex does not localize appropriately to the chromosomes. Similarly, in C. elegans, condensin activity is dependent on Aurora B in metaphase. However, in Xenopus egg cell-free extracts, condensin binding and chromosome condensation occur normally even in the absence of Aurora B. Likewise, after treating cells with an Aurora B enzyme inhibitor (Aurora B localization is not affected), the condensin complex localizes normally. Aurora B localizes to the paired arms of homologous chromosomes in metaphase I of C. elegans meiosis, and perturbs microtubule dynamics in mitosis. Release of this cohesion, which is dependent on Aurora B, is required for progression to anaphase I and segregation of homologous chromosomes. In mitotic vertebrate B lymphocytes, the proper centromeric localization of a number of Aurora B binding partners requires cohesin. Role in cytokinesis The Aurora B complex is necessary for cytokinesis in vertebrates, C. elegans, Drosophila, and fission yeast. In various cell types, overexpression of a catalytically inactive Aurora B prevents cytokinesis. Disruption of cytokinesis can also arise from Aurora B mislocalization due to mutation of Aurora B binding partners. Aurora B targets a number of proteins that localize to the cleavage furrow, including the type- III intermediate filament proteins vimentin, desmin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). In general, phosphorylation destabilizes intermediate filaments. Therefore, it has been proposed that phosphorylation of intermediate filaments at the cleavage furrow destabilizes the filaments in preparation for cytokinesis. In agreement with this hypothesis, mutation of Aurora B target sites in intermediate filament proteins leads to defects in filament deformation and prevents the final stage of cytokinesis. Aurora B also phosphorylates myosin II regulatory light chain at the cleavage furrow. Inhibition of Aurora B activity prevents proper myosin II localization to the cleavage furrow and disrupts spindle midzone organization. Role in the spindle assembly checkpoint The spindle assembly checkpoint inhibits progression of mitosis from metaphase to anaphase until all sister chromatid pairs are bioriented. Cells lacking Aurora B fail to arrest in metaphase even when chromosomes lack microtubule attachment. Consequently, Aurora B deficiency leads to progression through anaphase despite the presence of misaligned chromosomes. Aurora B may be involved in the localization of MAD2 and BubR1, proteins that recognize correct chromosome attachment to spindle microtubules. Loss of Aurora B lowers the concentration of Mad2 and BubR1 at the kinetochores. In particular, Aurora B seems to be responsible for maintaining the localization of Mad2 and BubR1 to the kinetochore following their initial recruitment, which occurs independent of Aurora B. Aurora B may be directly or indirectly involved in the hyper-phosphorylation of BubR1 seen in mitosis in wild-type cells. Interactions Aurora B kinase has been shown to interact with: * BARD1, * BIRC5, and * CDCA8 * TACC1. *FBXL2. Role in cancer Abnormally elevated levels of Aurora B kinase cause unequal chromosomal separation during cell division, resulting in the formation of cells with abnormal numbers of chromosomes, which are both a cause and driver of cancer. Inhibition of Aurora B kinase by BI811283 in cancer cells leads to the formation of cells with severely abnormal numbers of chromosomes (polyploid). Counterintuitively, inhibition of Aurora B kinase actually causes the polyploid cells formed to continue dividing however, because these cells have severe chromosomal abnormalities, they eventually stop dividing or undergo cell death. Role in axonal outgrowth and axon regeneration A novel function for Aurora B kinase has recently been reported in neurons. Following axotomy of cultured neurons, significant upregulation in Aurora B kinase gene expression was observed coinciding with regenerative axonal sprouting. Furthermore, overexpression of Aurora B kinase results in accelerated axonal outgrowth of spinal motor neurons in developing zebrafish.

Iver Johnson immigrated to Worcester, Massachusetts from Norway in 1863 at the height of the American Civil War. Johnson was a gunsmith by trade at the time, but also worked as an inventor in his spare time, which would come in handy later on as he sought new and creative uses for his partially idle manufacturing equipment, a thought process which would eventually lead him and his heirs to diversify the corporation's businesses. His early work involved not only gunsmithing locally in Fitchburg, MA, but it also included providing designs and work to other firearms companies, notably Allen & Wheelock for whom he made so-called \\"pepperbox\\" pistols.The Story of Allen & Wheelock Firearms (H. H. Thomas, author. Pioneer Press, Incorporated. 1991) Johnson Bye & Company In 1871, Johnson joined Martin Bye to form the Johnson Bye & Company, merging his own and Martin Bye's gunsmithing operations. During this period, Johnson and Bye filed for and received several new firearms features and firearms feature improvement patents. Their primary revenues came from the sale of their self designed and manufactured inexpensive models of revolvers. Not much is known about Martin Bye, as there is very little documented information about his life. Bye and Johnson filed jointly for and were awarded multiple patents together, mostly related to firearms designs, beginning in 1876. The company's name changed to Iver Johnson & Company in 1883 upon Johnson's purchase of Bye's interest in the firm. Bye continued to work in the firearm industry for the remainder of his life. Iver Johnson's Arms & Cycle Works The company's name changed again to Iver Johnson's Arms & Cycle Works in 1891, when the company relocated to Fitchburg, Massachusetts, (sometimes incorrectly referred to as \\"Fitzburg\\") in order to have better and larger manufacturing facilities. The company attracted a number of talented immigrant machinists and designers to its ranks, including O.F. Mossberg and Andrew Fyrberg, who would go on to invent the company's top-latching strap mechanism and the Hammer-the-Hammer transfer bar safety system used on the company's popular line of top-break safety revolvers.I.

They shepherded the company through a phase of expansion, as bicycle operations grew, then converted to motorcycle manufacturing and sales. They also saw the growth of the firearms business and the eventual restructuring of the company to focus on firearms and related business as they divested non-firearms concerns, such as the motorcycle business, in the face of growing firearms demand, World War I's armaments industry expansion, and other factors. As family ownership waned and outside investment via publicly traded stock and mergers/acquisitions/partnerships took hold, the company changed ownership and moved several times during its operation. The company eventually dropped \\"Cycle Works\\" from its moniker when that part of the business was shut down. The business successfully weathered the Great Depression (in part thanks to higher rates of armed robbery, which helped maintain demand for personal firearms) and was buoyed by the dramatic increase in the market for arms leading up to and during World War II. After World War II, the company's introduction of new firearms slowed to a trickle. Increasingly, company fortunes depended upon sales of its increasingly outmoded revolvers and single-barrel shotguns. Without new research and development, most firearms changes were limited to cosmetic updates of existing designs. As a result of changes in ownership, the company had the first of two major relocations in 1971 when it moved to New Jersey. It moved again to Jacksonville, Arkansas, and was jointly owned by Lynn Lloyd and Lou Imperato, who also owned the Henry brand name, before it finally ceased trading under its own name in 1993, at which time it was owned by American Military Arms Corporation (AMAC).Iver Johnson's Arms & Cycle Works Inc.

The revolver as well as the official police files, reports, interviews, ballistics reports, bullet fragments and other important evidence, related to Kennedy's assassination, is today housed in the California State Archives in Sacramento.  Bicycles  1927 Iver Johnson model 90 bicycle. Iver Johnson Arms & Cycle Works - \\"Honest cycles at honest prices\\" - 1897 Iver Johnson bicycles are classic examples of early American bicycles, and during the bicycle boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the company had a very productive bicycle manufacturing and sales line of business. Today, Iver Johnsons are considered to be \\"classics\\" by vintage bicycle collectors, and are considered to be especially pleasing from an aesthetic point of view. O.F. Mossberg worked in the bicycle plant and then started his own firearms factory. Even when they were new, I-J's were marketed and had a reputation for being very graceful looking, well built, and engineered for performance. Iver Johnson sponsored the career of bicycle racing champion Major Taylor beginning in 1900. The most noted I-J model was the truss-bridge frame which featured a curved tube under the top tube to strengthen the frame for use on the rough roads of the early twentieth century. Bicycle production ceased in 1940 with the buildup of arms production prior to World War II. Today, Iver Johnson bicycles are highly collectible, well sought after, and relatively rare compared to most other major manufacturer's products from that time. An Iver Johnson bicycle is on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in the America on the Move exhibit.  Motorcycles  Launched in Fitchburg, MA in 1907, The Iver Johnson Company motorcycle division was born from the conversion of a line of business that had been manufacturing bicycles for some 23 years prior to that point. Ultimately, the arms division of the business was growing so rapidly to meet demand that management decided to focus on that market and as a result motorcycle operations closed in 1916 (varying sources claim the last year as being 1915, with 1916 seeing only the sales of remaining 1915 produced inventory), bringing to an end 33 years of total cycle operations (23 for bicycles, and another 10 for motorcycle and run-off bicycle business). According to Jeffry L'H. Tank's History of the Motorcycle, Iver Johnson advertised their machines as \\"Mechanical Perfection,\\" a boast that was not entirely unbelievable given the number of advanced design features in especially their later models, such as dual crankshafts, nickel-alloy machined parts, chain drive, and a hand- operated three-speed gearbox. Among collectors and researchers who have the benefit of hindsight, Iver-Johnsons, such as the 1915 Model 15-7 along with Scotts, are the finest examples of motorcycle engineering of that era. End of Iver Johnson and revival of name In 2006 the name was reused as Iver Johnson Arms Incorporated in Florida as manufacturer and importer of firearms (from Philippines, Turkey and Belgium), including 1911-style semi-automatic pistols, but not related to the old Iver Johnson lines.http://iverjohnsonarms.com/ The new firm was renamed from Squires Bingham International, founded in 1973.http://www.m1carbinesinc.com/carbine_ijd.html  References  Other sources *Goforth, W.E.

It was directed by Peter Shin and Bill Kopp, and produced by Warner Bros. Animation. The cartoon was never released theatrically (due to the poor box-office performance of the 2003 animated film, Looney Tunes: Back in Action); it was initially released on the Australian DVD release of Looney Tunes: Back in Action (from which Sam reprises his role as a casino owner) and was later included in The Essential Bugs Bunny DVD set. The title is a parody of Hunter S. Thompson's book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and its film of the same name. Plot Bugs is living in his rabbit hole that is just outside of Las Vegas, when Yosemite Sam builds a casino over it. Being given the option to gamble or get out, Bugs tries his luck. At every game he plays (blackjack, roulette, slot machines) he wins in surprising and spectacular fashion, much to Sam's consternation. By the time he leaves with a sum total of $8,042,123,297.55 (more money comes out of Sam, as if he was another slot machine), Sam is down to his last quarter. After reprimanding a group of cheaters, tells them that lucky medals, four- leaf clovers, horseshoes, or rabbit's feet are not allowed, and realizes that he has been hornswoggled.

It is part of the National Defence University. It is the main human resource for the Turkish Air Force Command. It was founded in 1951, replacing the Army Flight School, with the mandate to train the officers of the Turkish Air Force. The academy provides an engineering education to Air Force cadets from Turkey as well as a number of other countries, and prepares them for careers in their respective Air Forces. TuAFA is recognized by the Turkish Council of Higher Education, as a university accredited to grant engineering degrees. It should not be confused with the Air War College (Hava Harp Enstit√ºs√º). Since 1992, the academy has accepted female cadets and allied countries' cadets for enrolment. Accepting cadets not only from Turkey, but also all over the world makes this college very unusual. The aim of the academy is to produce officers who have; *The qualities required in a soldier *Commandership, management and leadership skills *Military and general knowledge *Morally and mentally developed personality *Physical competence required for conditions of aviation With its core values, the college seeks to develop officer candidates' integrity, bravery and honour. History The Air Force Academy was first founded (as the ‚ÄúAir School‚Äù) in order to develop Turkish Military Aviation. It began operations on July 3, 1912 in Ye≈üilk√∂y, then moved to Eski≈üehir in 1926 and France-trained Captain Muzaffer G√ñKSENIN became its first director. As a result of developments in aviation and, in particular with the introduction of jet fighters into the Force, Chief of Staff of the Air Force Lieutenant General Muzaffer G√ñKSENIN transformed the Air School in Eski≈üehir was into the Air Force Academy on October 1, 1951 under the command of Staff Colonel Gavsi U√áAG√ñK. The 56 Air Force 3rd Lieutenants who graduated on August 30, 1953 were the first officers who were trained by the Air Force Academy exclusively. On the same day the Air Force Academy received its standard from the Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Fevzi U√áANER on behalf of the President of the Turkish Republic. On September 17, 1954, the Air Force Academy was moved to ƒ∞zmir due to the inadequacies in Eski≈üehir. In 1955 flight training was moved back to the period after the initial two-year academic education and the number of trainees was increased from 68 to 136. 1955 was the most populous year of the academy with 429 cadets enrolled in that year. In the same year, a first female cadet was recruited. After 1960 the Air Military High School became the main source of Cadets for the Air Force Academy. Civilian high schools became secondary sources of students. Rapid improvements in aviation and space technologies demanded fundamental changes in the education and training provided by the academy. On July 4, 1967 the academy was moved to ƒ∞stanbul in order to be able to access the resources and instructors of the universities and War Academies. The facilities which were constructed in Ye≈üilyurt ƒ∞stanbul for the Air Military High School were converted for the Air Force Academy. On August 30, 1968 the Air Force Academy had its first graduates in ƒ∞stanbul. The duration of the training was expanded from two years to three years in the 1969-1970 education period, and to four years in 1974. Until 1960 female cadets had been admitted to the academy. In 1992 after 32 years once again they began to be admitted, and a total number of 134 female officers have graduated from the academy from 1996 to the present (2011). Since 1992, 120 cadets of friendly and allied countries have also been trained in the Turkish Air Force Academy. On May 17, 2000 the Air Force Academy Dean of the Faculty was established. The foundation of the Air Force Academy Dean of the Faculty was a milestone in support of the academic activities to be implemented in a modern and efficient way. The Aeronautics and Space Technologies Institute was founded in 2001 for graduate studies. The institute serves as a higher education institute for both Air Force and other service branches. The Air Force Academy covers an area of 4.5 million square metres. Indoor and outdoor facilities are at Ye≈üilyurt, Istanbul and flight and encampment facilities are at Yalova. After 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt Naval academy (along with Military Academy, Air Force Academy and the all other military educational instutions) became part of the new National Defence University which is formed under Ministry of National Defence.  Program  The Academy's aim is to have pilot candidates who are trained in modern science and technology, and capable of dealing with the problems and issues of military daily life, and also with the attributes and abilities to strengthen the Turkish Armed Forces. The Academy uses different ways to achieve those aims via military, academic, affective domain, and physical education and training. TuAFA is a four-year institution of higher learning, providing an academic education, military training and physical training. = Academic program =  Undergraduate programs  The Academy educates cadets within the following departments in contemporary academic knowledge and skills with theoretical and practical lessons: Aeronautical Engineering, Electronic Engineering, Computer Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Applied Sciences, Military And Social Sciences, Foreign Languages, and Administrative Science.  Graduate programs  The Aeronautics and Space Technologies Institute (ASTIN) initially offered graduate programs in Aeronautics, Electronics, Computer, and Industrial Engineering subjects. An Aerospace program was initiated in the 2003-2004 academic year. The graduate program which offered 4 Master of Science (M.S.) programs at the start now continues with 5 programs. In addition, a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program in 4 disciplines is now being offered, and as well as the Master of Science programs, there is a newly opened program in Administrative Science, which aims to increase the management abilities of the cadets. = Physical training = In the academy, cadets trained to become jet pilots are prepared both physically and psychologically for demanding situations that they will face. The aims of the Physical Training Department are to get cadets enjoy doing sports, to contribute to the physical development of the cadets, to ensure the cadets consider sports as a way of life and do sports life-time and to teach cadets the sports techniques needed to do sports by themselves. CISM (Conseil International du Sport Militaire) and EUAFA (European Air Force Academies) sports events are held each year and the relevant teams attend the events. The sports branches in the academy are: Shooting, Track Field, Basketball, Fencing, Soccer, Aeronautical Pentathlon, Handball, Cross Country, Orienteering, Table Tennis, Taekwondo, Volleyball, Swimming, Tennis, Chess. In all sports branches the aim is to develop body and brain together. All cadets must take part in a sport branch. = Military training = Military training is provided under the programs Mechanic Marksmanship and Rifle Practice, Military Culture, Protocol and Rules of Good Manners. The purpose of Military Training is to inculcate discipline and the spirit of a soldier, to gain leadership in order to behave as a team commander when needed, to gain moral qualities which every soldier must possess, to gain physical efficiency, endurance, initiative and the spirit of a warrior. During the Air Force Academy education period, cadets also receive Applied Flight Training. With the help of this training, cadets improve their knowledge and skills about aviation. Cadets also receive Leadership Training and Character Training.  Social Clubs  The purpose of the activities of pedagogical clubs is improving cadets‚Äô abilities which they already have, providing them with a study of science and fine arts and providing opportunity for them to gain new abilities, increasing their good manners and general knowledge. Cadets taking part in these clubs display their works at the Eagles‚Äô week every year or on other occasions. Following are the social clubs in the Air Force Academy; Band Club, Music Club, Drawing/Marbling Club, Folk Dance Club, Model Aircraft, Electronics Club, Media Club, Drama Club. In addition, Project, Computer, Second Language Learning and English Conversation clubs are other extra curricular activities.  Supporting services  The Academy also contains supporting services such as Security Company Command, Light Weapon Maintenance Unit, Photograph Studio, Service Company Command, Engineering ‚Äì Maintenance Battalion Command, Communications Electronics and Information Systems Company Command, Band Command and Transportation Battalion Command.

In 1880, the grammar school was relocated to the current site on King Edward Road, the other side of the church yard. The new building was built in a Tudor style by the architect C.C. Rolfe. The college was frequently extended during the 20th century to accommodate growing numbers of students. The Arnold Building, a new building opposite the main college site, was completed in 1994. In 2006, another small building was constructed next to the Arnold Building to hold the history department. =The New College= In recent years, the college has expanded its site with a new Study Centre, a specifically designed modern Art Block, Law Classrooms, Physics Labs, a re-developed library and Student Refectory. Extracurricular activities =The Student Voice= A codified constitution was created in 2007 which made provisions for student representation in college affairs. It identified two institutions responsible for representing the students of the college; the 'College Council' which consists of representatives from each tutor group in the college and the 'Student Executive Committee',College Prospectus 2011/12 which consists of six elected positions: * Male Chair - Chairs and oversees council meetings * Female Chair - Chairs and oversees council meetings * Treasurer - Manages the council's budget * Secretary - Responsible for the minutes of each meeting * Entertainments Officer - Arranges college parties, charity events etc. * Press Officer - Deals with the promotional activities involved in organising all events undertaken by the committee Collectively the College Council and Student Executive Committee are responsible for: organising charity fund- raising events, College Parties and the end of year Valedictory Ball. They are also involved in planning the annual 'Celebrating Student Achievement Evening', they meet with the Board of Governors and may make proposals regarding various student/college related issues to the Principal of the College. =Sports teams= The Nuneaton Old Edwardians Rugby Football Club (RFC) was initially founded in 1910 to provide rugby football for former pupils of the Grammar School, the club went open in 1955 allowing players from all backgrounds to join. The club is still active and is participating in the Midlands 1 East League.Nuneaton Old Edwardians - About Us =Enrichment activities= The college offers an enrichment programme which is designed to offer a wide range of sporting and recreational opportunities to students. These timetabled activities take place once a week and are compulsory for first year students. Although enrichment is not compulsory for students after their first year, they are free to continue with it if they choose. Activities include various sporting activities, participation in college media (e.g. the college newspaper, radio station and film-making club) and a variety of clubs/societies. =Alumni Association= The King Edward VI College Alumni Association was launched in May 2011 by former students Vicky Fowler and Mohsin Shah. The association is open to all former college students and staff members. It aims to organise social and network events for former students of the college, provide careers advice support for current students and promote the work of King Edward VI College within the local community. Academic performance The college offers 45 AS and A level courses, and an additional a range of GCSE and BTEC courses. Around 40% of students gain grades A or B at A level and the pass rate is at the average for the sixth form sector, the highest performing sector in education at 98%. Virtually all BTEC students earn Merit grades or better. Student retention is high at 95%. Every year around 6 students go to Oxford or Cambridge Universities. Almost all 99.2% of students - achieve positive destinations: the majority, 75%, go onto University, 5% go onto FE/Apprenticeships and around 20% gain employment. The College has frequently won awards for having the top performing student in the summer examination series across a range of subjects. Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry and Physics student win Olympiad Gold, Silver and Bronze Medals every year. The college achieved an overall grade 2 (good), in its most recent OFSTED inspection in May 2015.

Its chemical formula is CH3POF2. It is a Schedule 1 substance in the sense of the Chemical Weapons Convention. It is used for production of sarin and soman as a component of binary chemical weapons; an example is the M687 artillery shell, where it is used together with a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and isopropyl amine, producing sarin.  Preparation  Methylphosphonyl difluoride can be prepared by reacting methylphosphonyl dichloride with hydrogen fluoride (HF) or sodium fluoride (NaF). Safety Methylphosphonyl difluoride is both reactive and corrosive. It is absorbed through skin and causes burns and mild nerve agent symptoms. It reacts with water producing HF fumes and methylphosphonic acid as a result. It is also capable of corroding glass. Significance in International Relations In 2013-2014, the stockpile of chemicals covered by the CWC was removed from Syria and destroyed.

Located on the south side of the Marylebone Road, it was a rural location when first built, before the construction of the New Road. An admittance charge was made, redeemable with the waiters, as a method of preventing those with no money from enjoying the facilities. Its name comes from a fashionable slang word of the 18th century for strong or old ale. The name possibly comes from the sharp, or \\"stinging\\" flavour of a well-matured beer. In 1786, the Committee for the Relief of the Black Poor used it as one of the centres for distributing alms.The Yorkshire Stingo public house (National Archives) accessed 16 January 2008 A bowling green and pleasure gardens were added in the 18th century. In 1829, it became one of the first terminuses for London buses. In 1836, an early music hall for vaudeville and burlesque, called the Apollo Saloon, was added, but by 1848 the gardens were closed. The public house was finally closed in 1964. The site has since been used for the County Court and a public baths. Thomas Paine's cast iron bridge During 1790 the Yorkshire Stingo was the temporary home of the second cast iron bridge ever built. (The first was The Iron Bridge.) This was designed by Thomas Paine, better known as the author of the revolutionary best-seller Rights of Man. Paine had endeavoured to interest the authorities in Philadelphia and Paris in his design. He had gained a patent for this in 1788 and Walkers, who had an ironworks in Sheffield, agreed to construct it. Paine said of it that \\"Nothing in the world is as fine as my bridge, except a woman.\\" The original design of ‚Äì to span the Schuylkill River, Philadelphia ‚Äì had been scaled down to . Paine discussed the bridge in correspondence with Thomas Jefferson, Sir Joseph Banks, George Washington and Sir George Staunton, and entertained hopes that it might be the model for an iron bridge across the Thames as well as the Seine. Paine supervised both the work at the Walker factory, and the erection of the bridge in the grounds of the Yorkshire Stingo. It weighed three tons and could bear a weight of six. Peter Whiteside, a Philadelphian merchant, was backing the project, but found himself in financial difficulties and asked Paine to return the money he had lent; in the end, the project had to be abandoned. Parts of it were then used in a bridge over the River Wear in Sunderland. William Yates, who had acted as Paine's foreman, went on to work on the Wear bridge and then Southwark Bridge, built by John Rennie. Paine later quipped that \\"the French revolution, and Mr Burke's attacks upon it, drew me off any pontifical works\\".

It is located in the district of Tuzla in Istanbul. Its mission is to develop cadets mentally and physically for service as commissioned officers in the Turkish Navy. It must not be confused with Naval War College (Deniz Harp Enstit√ºs√º) History =Foundation= The roots of the Naval Academy goes back to 1773, when a naval school under the name of \\"Naval Engineering at Golden Horn Naval Shipyard\\" was founded during the reign of Sultan Mustafa III on the command of Grand Vizier and Admiral Cezayirli Gazi Hasan Pasha. Fran√ßois Baron de Tott, a French officer and advisor to the Ottoman military, was appointed for the establishment of a course to provide education on plane geometry and navigation. The course, attended also by civilian captains of the merchant marine, was given on board of a galleon anchored at Kasimpa≈üa in Istanbul and lasted three months.Official homepage The temporary course turned into a continuous education on land with the establishment of \\"Naval Mathematical College\\" in February 1776. With growing number of cadets, the college building at the naval shipyard was extended. On October 22, 1784, the college, renamed the \\"Imperial Naval Engineering School\\" (), started its education for three years in the new building. From 1795 on, the training was divided into navigation and cartography for officers of the deck, and naval architecture and shipbuilding for naval engineers. =Ottoman period= The school was moved 1822 into a reconstructed sawmill building in Parmakkapƒ± after a fire in Kasƒ±mpa≈üa neighborhood in 1821 destroyed also the naval school. Since this building was insufficient for the matters of education, Sultan Mahmud II ordered the construction of a new school building. It was decided that until the completion of the new facility, the navigation division of the school be transferred temporarily to Heybeliada, an island in the Sea of Marmara. In 1838, the naval school moved into its new building in Kasƒ±mpa≈üa. With the beginning of the reformation efforts, the school was renamed to \\"Naval School\\" () and continued to serve in Kasƒ±mpa≈üa for 12 years. Then, it was relocated 1850 to Heybeliada for the last time. The facilities of the naval school on Heybeliada consisted of 34 rooms for 150 cadets, a 30-bed hospital with a pharmacy, a printing house with a bookbinder's shop, and a rich library. The training followed English education system, and some lessons were even taught by English instructors. In that period, in addition to the name \\"Naval School\\", it was also called \\"Imperial Naval School\\" (), \\"School of Naval Sciences\\" (Mekteb-i F√ºnun-i Bahriye) or \\"Imperial School of Naval Sciences\\" (Mekteb-i F√ºnun-i Bahriye-i ≈ûahane). During the reign of Sultan Abd√ºl√¢ziz, the number of the cadets increased, and the education program was improved. The training program was extended parallel to technological development of the century, and a division for marine engineering was added to operate and maintain steam engines. Cadets were educated four years in the Naval High School, and they were trained four more years in the Naval Academy, whereas the last two years were spent on board the school ship. During the Second Constitutional Era, an upgraded education system was adapted in 1909 from the Royal Naval Academy. In the years of the Balkan Wars, the educational system was modified. Hence, the graduates of the four-year Naval High School received sea training for one year on board the school ship as a midshipman followed by three years training in the navy in the rank of ensign. Upon graduation, they assumed their duties by being promoted to Lieutenant-Commander grade. The school, nicknamed the \\"Island School\\", had the property of being most significant school of Turkey with respect to both educational system and social life. =Republican era= The admission to the Naval School resumed in 1924 after the proclamation of the Republic, and the cadets could study in one of the three fields such as navigation, engineering and secretary work. The training term for deck officers and engineers was four years with the first year in the prep school. Graduates underwent a course for another year and entered the Navy after being promoted to engineer (ensign). \\"Heybeliada Naval School\\" (Heybeliada Bahriye Mektebi) was given the name of \\"Naval High School\\" (Deniz Lisesi) by the command of General Chief of Staff on May 27, 1928, and the curriculum of military schools was adopted in the following education term. This new education and training system was applied for two academic years. Naval High School and Naval Core School were re-united at the facilities of Heybeliada under the name of \\"Naval Academy and High School\\" (Deniz Harp Okulu ve Lisesi). =During the World War II= When the World War II broke out, and Germans began to occupy the Balkans in 1941, the relocation of the Naval School to Anatolia became necessary. On May 23, 1941, Naval Academy and High School were transferred to the Infantry Barracks in Mersin. The institution remained at this place unsuitable for its educational purposes until September 9, 1946, when it finally returned to Heybeliada. = Modern Period = The transfer of the academy to a more convenient location arose as a necessity, due to increasing demands of the Turkish Navy over personnel and place as well as transportation problems of the island of Heybeliada. A new campus was projected over land at Tuzburnu peninsula on the northern shore of Marmara Sea in Tuzla district of Istanbul. On July 28, 1977, Fahri Korut√ºrk, President of Turkey and an alumnus of the Naval School, laid the foundation. The Naval Academy facilities in Tuzla were opened by the Turkish President Kenan Evren on July 31, 1985. The academy left Heybeliada to the Naval High School. First officers from the new campus graduated in 1989. At the beginning of 1990, the status of military academies in regard of the Bachelor of Science concept at universities was discussed. With the beginning of the academic term 1991-1992, the education programs at military academies were upgraded in a manner equivalent to the engineering programs at Boƒüazi√ßi University, Istanbul Technical University and Middle East Technical University. The graduates receive a BSc degree upon graduation from the Naval Academy without requiring further studies in post-graduate programs of the technical universities in Turkey. The first officers with a BSc degree in addition to a Naval Academy diploma left the institution in 1997. Control and electronic engineering branch, a sub-division of electric/electronics division, was separated as control systems and computer engineering in 1993, starting from the second class. To become harmonized with STCW-95 agreements (international midshipman educational program), a new educational program starting from the first class was applied in 1995. Moreover, the number of vocational and foreign language courses was increased, graduation project was extended from one-semester to four-semester course, meteorology and intelligence courses were added. For the training of officers for the marines and engineering corps branches, graduates of civilian high schools were admitted in 1995 to the first class. However, this type of sourcing process was abandoned the next year. The first officers of marines and engineering corps were commissioned in 1998. In 2000, the academy's organization was restructured by reconstructing the branches granting engineering degrees and increasing the number of major science branches from four to nine. The same year, the \\"Naval Sciences and Engineering Institute\\" was founded for postgraduate studies in order to meet the needs of the Turkish Armed Forces, starting from 2001‚Äì02 academic term. After 2016 Turkish coup d'√©tat attempt Naval academy (along with Military Academy, Air Force Academy and the all other military educational instutions) became part of the new National Defence University which is formed under Ministry of National Defence. Education Until 1953, education term at the Naval Academy was two years, the first year theoretical at the school and the last year practice in the Navy. In 1953, four-year line system education was adopted. In the first two years, the students were cadets and in the following two years officers. With the academic term 1969‚Äì70, the education structure was reorganized such as the cadets studied three years and the officers one year. One year later, the organization was modified so that the officers were educated in the \\"Officer Basic Expert School\\". In 1974, the education term was increased to four years and the curriculum was extended in regard of the modern technologies and sciences with electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering, operations research, management science, systems engineering, communications, computer science, shipbuilding, oceanography and international relations. First officers having studied in this program graduated in 1978. With the beginning of the academic term 1986-1987, these modern fields of study are fully implemented in the curriculum as majors.

It is native to South Africa northwards to Mozambique. In its native climes this slow-growing tree can reach up to high and in stem diameter. Aloidendron barberae is Africa's largest aloe-like plant. The tree aloe is often used as an ornamental plant. Its tubular flowers are rose pink (green-tipped); it flowers in winter and in its natural environment is pollinated by sunbirds. Taxonomy Aloidendron barberae was first collected and submitted for classification by Mary Elizabeth Barber, who was a plant collector in the former Transkei. She sent specimens of the plant and its flowers to the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, where in 1874 it was named by William Turner Thiselton-Dyer (1843‚Äì1928) in her honor. Subsequently, it was also found in KwaZulu-Natal by the well known traveller, explorer and painter Thomas Baines in 1873. He also sent a specimen to Kew, where it was named Aloe bainesii. Although known as A. bainseii for many years, Aloe barberae was the name first given to this plant, and takes precedence according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature,Aloe barberae by Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden and so is the epithet used in the combination Aloidendron barberae. Distribution The tree aloe's habitat is subtropical coastal forests, kloofs (ravines) and dry valleys in the eastern regions of southern Africa. Aloidendron barberae is widely distributed from the Eastern Cape through the former Transkei, KwaZulu-Natal, Swaziland and Mpumalanga; and northwards to Mozambique and East Africa. Cultivation Aloidendron barberae forms a striking focal point in the garden, being an enormous sculptural tree with a neat crown. It is easily propagated, especially by cuttings (truncheons) which should be left to dry for a week or two before planting. It prefers well- drained soil, especially on a slope, and can tolerate some shade when small. It should not be planted in between buildings or in spots where its roots will be constrained, as its trunk and roots need to expand and spread. =Hybrids and cultivars= Several hybrid varieties have been created between this species and its relative Aloidendron dichotomum (the quiver tree) and, more rarely, with Aloe species. These all tend to be more short and compact than pure A. barberae. Some of the more popular hybrids include: * 'Hercules' (A. barberae √ó dichotoma), the most common hybrid, with golden-grey trunk, and compact grey leaves. * 'Rex' (A. barberae √ó dichotoma), a fast-growing cultivar developed in Swellendam, which has a grey trunk, and more slender grey-green leaves with pink teeth. Seed parent is dichotoma. * 'Goliath' (A. barberae √ó Aloe vaombe), a very fast-growing top-heavy hybrid, with a slender trunk and an enormous head of massive rubbery dark-green leaves. * 'Nick Deinhart' (A. barberae √ó Aloe speciosa), a new hybrid using A. barberae pollen, with glaucous blue foliage. * 'Medusa', this is often considered a cultivar, but is in fact the natural Mozambican form of A. barberae.

Location and geography Normanville is 77 km south of Adelaide, South Australia. It is the largest regional centre on the western side of the Fleurieu Peninsula. It is situated next to the mouth of the Bungala River. History The town was established by South Australia's first dentist, Robert Norman, in 1849. General houses for people were built first, followed by the general store, and the hotel. This was quickly followed by the local Government House, which housed the Police Officer, court house, and jail cells. Norman opened the Normanville Hotel in 1851 and a church soon after. The Normanville Hotel became the host of the first district council meeting for the area. The town eventually grew to become a successful wheat exporting area, using the nearby jetty at the current Normanville Beach as a port for ships coming and going. However, with the development of Adelaide as the capital city, it lost its prior importance. =Heritage listings= Normanville includes the following sites listed on the South Australian Heritage Register: * 18 Main South Road: Normanville Wesleyan Cemetery * Little Gorge Beach, Main South Road: Dickson Beach House * Williss Drive: Ferguson's Flour Mill *Normanville Coastal Dunes Economy Normanville's economy is primarily based on and driven by tourism, although primary production is still active in the area.

A probing Russian force, circumventing Vaxholm Castle, attempted to pass through Baggensst√§ket, a very narrow passage in the Stockholm archipelago. After a counterattack by S√∂dermanlands regemente the Russian force were defeated and departed. Prelude After the death of Charles XII of Sweden at Fredriksten in 1718, the Swedish armies had pulled back from all fronts. Surrounded by hostiles, it was clear that a peace treaty would not be forthcoming without large territorial losses. An attempt was made to play the adversaries against each other, but Russia forced the issue by building and equipping a large Baltic fleet with orders to pillage and harass the eastern Swedish seaboard. On 11 July 1719 the fleet was spotted off the Swedish coast. The Swedish navy was shattered after the long war, but still offered some resistance. The Russian fleet on its side did not commit to a battle, but proceeded burning cities (like Norrk√∂ping) and farmsteads. Admiral Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin had already investigated Baggensst√§ket, \\"the backdoor to Stockholm\\" as a way to reach the capital city without passing the fortress at Vaxholm. The Russian's interest was noticed. Under the supervision of the colonel of fortifications Baltzar von Dahlheim boulder-filled boats were towed into the very narrow strait, where they were sunk in the shallowest and narrowest parts to render it impassable. A small redoubt with three cannon and 400 men guarded the channel, while four galleys were anchored in the L√§nnersta sound beyond. Probably in order to apply more pressure on Sweden in the peace negotiations, Apraxin decided to attempt an attack on Stockholm. On 10 August, Russian units were spotted around G√•l√∂, Musk√∂, and Orn√∂, about 20 kilometers from Baggenst√§ket. If they could pass through Baggenst√§ket it would be possible to reach the capital while completely out of reach of the cannon of Vaxholm. The battle On the morning of 13 August, generaladjutant Filip von Tessin returned from a scouting mission to Baggenst√§ket to report that Russian galleys had been spotted at the entrance to the passage. The closest large Swedish army unit, the 800-man S√∂dermanlands regemente, was alerted and under its commander Rutger Fuchs force marched 19 kilometers to meet the enemy. Lieutenant-colonel Johan von Essen was sent ahead with a force to protect the arrival of the rest of the regiment. After a rapid march through rocky and densely forested terrain under a hot summer sun, von Essen reached Baggenst√§ket before 7pm without encountering any fire. However the Russians by then had disembarked their forces, on both sides of the channel's eastern entrance. Continuing their rapid march, von Essen's unit suddenly came under fire from the fields around Skogs√∂ g√•rd. Its position was very exposed and the unit took losses; von Essen himself was wounded. At 8 pm, Fuchs' battalion arrived and received news of von Essen's situation. To his right von Essen had a marsh, which forced Fuchs to pass von Essen on his left, a difficult move through snarled and hilly terrain as darkness was falling. The Russians heard Fuchs' approach and opened fire. Fuch's battalion responded and caused losses to the tightly grouped Russians, but was soon also in danger of being outflanked, on its left. Fuchs' started to withdraw into the woods and the Russians did not pursue. After two hours of confused fighting the battle was over, and the Russian soldiers retreated into their landing craft. Aftermath Apraksin's probe had been repulsed and the immediate threat to Stockholm had been averted. Due to unfavorable winds, Apraksin's fleet was forced to remain in Baggensfj√§rden the next day, but eventually left before the arrival of an English fleet commanded by Admiral John Norris and the Karlskrona squadron. Rutger Fuchs was acclaimed as a hero and \\"saviour of Stockholm\\" after the action and was promoted to Major General and made friherre. However, the Russian fleet was untouched and would continue to harass the eastern coast of Sweden the next year until it suffered heavy losses in the battle of Ledsund.

Sibilance lies in frequencies anywhere between 2‚Äì10 kHz, depending on the individual voice. Causes Excess sibilance can be caused by compression, microphone choice and technique, and even simply the way a person's mouth anatomy is shaped. Ess sound frequencies can be irritating to the ear, especially with earbuds or headphones, and interfere with an otherwise modulated and pleasant audio stream. Process of de-essing Broadband de-essing There are several time and frequency based algorithms that can reduce sibilance or de-ess the sound. Time-domain based approaches, such as bandpass filters, are more suited to real-time applications such as live radio due to less constraint on Digital signal processor. Playback or offline applications incorporate Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based methods. =Using a dedicated de-essing plugin= In the current digital stronghold of audio production, the most commonly used tool for taming excessive sibiliance is a de-esser plugin. A dynamic equalizer can be used to achieve the same effects as a de-esser, however, plugin manufacturers have tailored these tools to operate efficiently within the mid-high to high frequencies. A de-essing plugin will compress the desired signal according to the amplitude of the selected frequency as it passes over a preset threshold. In the case of excessive sibilance anywhere from 4-10k will often be where the problem resides. Certain plugins will allow you to shape the envelope of the compression to achieve a more musical effect. Over de-essing can result in the over manipulation of transients resulting in the softening or hardening of certain consonants, yielding undesirable effects. Split-band de-essing Dynamic-equalization de-essing De-essing is a dynamic audio editing process, only working when the level of the signal in the sibilant range (the ess sound) exceeds a set threshold. De-essing temporarily reduces the level of high frequency content in the signal when a sibilant ess sound is present. De- essing differs from equalization, which is a static change in level among many frequencies. However, equalization of the ess frequencies alone can be manipulated to reduce the level of sibilance. =Side-chain compression or broadband de-essing= With this technique, the signal feeding the side-chain of a dynamic range compressor is equalized or filtered so that the sibilant frequencies are most prominent. As a result, the compressor only reduces the level of the signal when there is a high level of sibilance. This reduces the level over the entire frequency range. Because of this, attack and release times are extremely important, and threshold settings cannot be placed as low as with other types of de-essing techniques without experiencing more blatant sound artifacts. =Split-band compression= Here, the signal is split into two frequency ranges, a range that contains the sibilant frequencies, and a range that does not. The signal containing the sibilant frequencies is sent to a compressor. The other frequency range is not processed. Finally the two frequency ranges are combined back into one signal. The original signal can either be split into high (sibilant) and low frequencies, or split so that the frequencies both below and above the sibilance are untouched. This technique is similar to multi-band compression. =Dynamic equalization= The gain of a parametric equalizer is reduced as the level of the sibilance increases. The frequency range of the equalizer is centered on the sibilant frequencies. =De-essing with automation= A more recent method of de-essing involves automation of the vocal level in a digital audio workstation (DAW). Whenever problematic sibilance occurs the level can be set to follow automation curves that are manually drawn in by the user. This method is made feasible by editing automation points directly, as opposed to programming by manipulating gain sliders in a write-mode. An audio engineer would not be able to react fast enough to precisely reduce and restore vocal levels for the brief duration of sibilants during real-time playback. =De-essing without automation or with manual equalization= Highlighted the frequency of the ess in the spoken word \\"instantly\\" on an audio editing timeline Equalization curve lowering the decibels of an ess frequency range for a human voice Audio editing software, whether professional or amateur software such as Audacity, can use the built-in equalization effects to reduce or eliminate sibilance ess sounds that interfere with a recording. Described here is a common method with Audacity. The process is in two phases: 1) analyze the frequency of the voice's ess sound by sampling several instances and calculating the range of ess frequencies. Male voices sibilance range in 3000Hz to 6000Hz while female voice's typically range in 6000-8000Hz(sourced from plug-in guide). Next, 2) apply an equalization filter to quiet the determined frequency band by -4 dB to -11db during ess frequency time events. The rise and fall time of filter should be fast (less than 10ms) in order to clip the sibilance specific instances only References * See also Category:Dynamics processing Category:Speech processing ","title":"De-essing"},{"id":"9874922","text":"The MV Mary Murray was a long Staten Island Ferry vessel launched in 1937.

She sat tied up at a creek on the Raritan River within view of the New Jersey Turnpike until she was dismantled for scrap in 2008‚Äì2012. History The Mary Murray was named for the American Revolutionary War figure Mary Lindley Murray. The vessel was built and launched from the United Dry Docks on Staten Island in 1937 during a grand ceremony with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and 500 other spectators in attendance. The ship, part of the Miss New York ferryboat class, cost $912,000 to build. The Mary Murray was retired in 1974 and sold at auction. From 1982 through the mid-2000s, she sat as a floating wreck on the Raritan River within view of the New Jersey Turnpike. Her owner was George Searle, a former merchant mariner, who had intentions of turning it into a restaurant or museum. Shortly after purchasing the Mary Murray, Searle had the vessel towed to a spot near his marina on the south side of the Raritan River. The state sued Searle in 1981 because the boat was docked in the middle of the river. In 1982 he moved the vessel to his property on the side of the river, tying her to the bank partially up \\"No-Name Creak\\", where she stayed until she was dismantled. The location contained other vessels and barges purchased by Searle including a ship purported to be owned by a former Shah of Iran.From Ferrying Thousands Daily to Rusting Away by the Turnpike, The New York Times, March 11, 2007 Dismantling In March 2008 it was announced that the ferry would be dismantled and used for scrap metal.

(\\"Silent Help\\"), an organisation assisting neo-Nazi activists. Christophersen appeared as a witness in the trial of Ernst Z√ºndel in Canada. Christophersen eventually fled the country, first to Belgium, and later to Kollund in DenmarkProfil: Die Bauernschaft Antifaschistisches Pressearchiv und Bildungszentrum Berlin e.V., 2005. where he spent 10 years. There he established the Kollund-Verlag (Kollund Publishing House), which distributed denialist material throughout the world. He appeared in two videos, in which he claimed that it was a privilege for prisoners to be detained in Auschwitz. According to Christophersen they were treated excellently, and were given the opportunity to be deployed to work groups (in reality forced labour) appropriate to their professions. In the film Die Auschwitz-L√ºge und ihre Folgen (\\"The Auschwitz Lie and Its Consequences\\") he was interviewed by Ernst Z√ºndel. His brochure Die Bauernschaft (\\"Farming Community\\"), in which Christophersen disseminated further Holocaust-denying material, was seized by the authorities several times, the last being in 1994. In 1995 the distribution rights for this set of publications passed to Ernst Z√ºndel in Canada, but he relinquished this just a year later. In the same year Christophersen settled in Switzerland, but was deported in 1996. Christophersen died on 13 February 1997 in Molfsee near Kiel.

The Wilmington Ten were nine young men and a woman, who were wrongfully convicted in 1971 in Wilmington, North Carolina of arson and conspiracy. Most were sentenced to 29 years in prison, and all ten served nearly a decade in jail before an appeal won their release. The case became an international cause c√©l√®bre, in which many critics of the city and state characterized the activists as political prisoners. Amnesty International took up the case in 1976 and provided legal defense counsel to appeal the convictions. In 1978, Governor Jim Hunt reduced the sentences of the ten defendants. In 1980 in Chavis v. State of North Carolina, 637 F.2d 213 (4th Cir., 1980), the convictions were overturned by the federal appeals court, on the grounds that the prosecutor and the trial judge had both violated the defendants' constitutional rights. They were not retried. In 2012 the surviving members of the Ten were pardoned by Governor Beverly Perdue. Background In the 1960s and 1970s, black residents of Wilmington, North Carolina were dissatisfied with the lack of progress in implementing integration and other civil rights reforms achieved by the American Civil Rights Movement through congressional passage of civil rights legislation in 1964 and 1965. Many struggled with poverty and lack of opportunity. Despair at the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. increased racial tensions, with a rise in violence, including the arson of several white-owned businesses. Racial tension increased further after the 1969 integration of Wilmington high schools. The city chose to close the black Williston Industrial High School, a source of community pride. It laid off black teachers, principals, and coaches, transferring students among white- majority schools. The school board did little to prepare whites or blacks for these changes. The school administration resisted meeting with students to hear their grievances, including separation from friends and the lack of opportunity to play sports in new schools.Laura Colatuno, The Wilmington Ten: A Story Retold (2003) Several clashes between white and black students resulted in a number of arrests and expulsions. In response to tensions, members of a Ku Klux Klan chapter and other white supremacist groups began patrolling the streets. They hung an effigy of the white superintendent of the schools and cut his phone lines. Street violence broke out between them and black men. Students decided to boycott the high schools in January 1971. In February, the United Church of Christ sent Reverend Benjamin Chavis, Jr., from their Commission for Racial Justice, to Wilmington to try to calm the situation and work with the students. He preached non-violence and met with students regularly at Gregory Congregational Church to discuss black history, as well as to organize the boycott. Arson at Mike's Grocery and trial On February 6, 1971, Mike's Grocery, a white-owned business, was firebombed. Firefighters responding to the fire said they were shot at by snipers from the roof of the nearby Gregory Congregational Church. Chavis and several students had been meeting at the church, which also held other people. The neighborhood erupted in rioting that lasted through the next day, in which two people died. The North Carolina governor called up the National Guard, whose forces entered the church on February 8 and removed the suspects. The Guard claimed to have found ammunition in the building. The violence resulted in two deaths, six injuries, and more than $500,000 in property damage. Chavis and nine others, eight young black men who were high school students, and an older, white, female anti-poverty worker, were arrested on charges of arson related to the grocery fire. Based on testimony of two black men, they were tried and convicted in state court of arson and conspiracy in connection with the firebombing of Mike's Grocery. They were sentenced to a total of 282 years in prison. The \\"Ten\\" and their sentences: * Benjamin Chavis (age 24) - 34 years * Connie Tindall (age 21) - 31 years * Marvin \\"Chili\\" Patrick (age 19) - 29 years * Wayne Moore (age 19) - 29 years * Reginald Epps (age 18) - 28 years * Jerry Jacobs (age 19) - 29 years * James \\"Bun\\" McKoy (age 19) - 29 years * Willie Earl Vereen (age 18) - 29 years * William \\"Joe\\" Wright, Jr. (age 19) - 29 years * Ann Shepard (age 35) - 15 years Trial and sentencing At the time, the state's case against the Wilmington Ten was seen as controversial both in the state of North Carolina and in the United States. One witness testified that he was given a minibike in exchange for his testimony against the group. Another witness, Allen Hall, had a history of mental illness and had to be removed from the courthouse after recanting on the stand under cross examination. Each of the ten defendants was convicted of the charges. The men's sentences ranged from 29 years to 34 years for arson, considered severe punishment for a fire in which no one died. Ann Shepard of Auburn, New York, age 35, received 15 years as an accessory before the fact and conspiracy to assault emergency personnel. The youngest of the group, Earl Vereen, was 18 years old at the time of his sentencing. Reverend Chavis was the oldest of the men at age 24. The sentences totaled 282 years. International response Several national magazines, including Time, Newsweek, Sepia and The New York Times Magazine, published articles in the late 1970s on the trial and its aftermath. When then President Jimmy Carter admonished the Soviet Union in 1978 for holding political prisoners, the Soviets cited the Wilmington Ten as an example of American political imprisonment. Appeals Amnesty International took on the Wilmington Ten case in 1976. They classified the eight men still in prison as among 11 black men incarcerated in the U.S. who were considered to be political prisoners, under the definition in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In 1976 and 1977, three key prosecution witnesses recanted their testimony. In 1977 60 Minutes aired a special about the case, suggesting that the evidence against the Wilmington Ten was fabricated. In 1978, the New York Times reporter Wayne King published an investigatory article; based on testimony of a witness whose anonymity he protected, he said that perhaps the prosecution had framed a guilty man, as his source said that he had committed the crimes at the behest of Chavis.Wayne King, \\"The Case Against the Wilmington Ten,\\" New York Times Magazine, 3 December 1978 In 1978 Governor Jim Hunt reduced the sentences of the Ten.\\"North Carolina Governor Pardons Wilmington 10\\", Prison Legal News, January 2013; accessed 13 June 2018 In 1980, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, a federal court, overturned the convictions, as it determined that (1) the prosecutor failed to disclose exculpatory evidence, in violation of the defendants' due process rights (the Brady rule]); and (2) the trial judge erred by limiting the cross-examination of key prosecution witnesses about special treatment the witnesses received in connection with their testimony, in violation of the defendants' 6th Amendment right to confront the witnesses against them. Chavis v. State of North Carolina, 637 F.2d 213 (4th Cir. 1980). It ordered a new trial, but the state chose not to prosecute again. Chavis and the other seven prisoners were released. A group called the Wilmington Ten Foundation for Social Justice was established to work to improve conditions in the city.  Pardon  In May 2012, Benjamin Chavis and six surviving members of the group petitioned North Carolina governor Beverly Perdue for a pardon. The NAACP supported the pardon, as well as arguing for compensation to be paid to the men and their survivors for their years in jail.\\"Four decades later, Ben Chavis and the Wilmington Ten seek a declaration of innocence\\", Charlotte News Observer, 18 May 2012 On December 22, 2012 The New York Times published an editorial titled, \\"Pardons for the Wilmington Ten\\", that urged Governor Perdue to \\"finally pardon\\" the group of civil rights activists.

Dalesio, AP (17 May 2012), Wilmington 10: Pardons Sought in NC Race-Riot Case, Associated Press The claims were approved by the North Carolina Industrial Commission and signed off on by the Attorney General Roy Cooper's office in May 2013. Total compensation was $1,113,605: Ben Chavis received $244,470, Marvin Patrick received $187,984, with most of the remaining rewards being $175,000 each. As four of the Wilmington Ten were deceased at this date, their families received no compensation. A case is currently pending before the NC Industrial Commission seeking that compensation be awarded to the families of the four deceased; Jerry Jacobs, Ann Shepard, Connie Tindall, and Joe Wright.

The original castle on the site was a feudal motte built in wood. The present castle was built during the 12th century on the edge of a plateau, facing the Lure plain, the Ch√¢teau d'Oricourt is a double-walled castle. The outer wall enclosed the farm and the inner wall the residential courtyard. In the latter are a collection of buildings from the 12th and 15th centuries, including the well, a cistern, bakery, cellars and a grand dining room. Two square towers, 25m (~81 ft) high, dominate the curtain walls and deep ditches. Outside, on the village side, an imposing pigeon loft has been built. The original owners, the Gaucher family, added \\"d'Oricourt\\" to their name. Gaucher d‚ÄôOricourt was constable to the count of Burgundy was the lord of Oricourt around 1170. Around 1250, the Vaire family occupied the castle. In 1435, during the Renaissance period, the castle came into the ownership of Nicolas Rolin, chancellor of Burgundy, who was immortalised by Van Eyck in the painting The Virgin with Chancellor Rolin (Paris, Louvre). His son, Guillaume Rolin, took possession in 1462; it was probably Guillaume who had the tasteful residence built against the north curtain. One of the windows is decorated with a mask of Nicolas Rolin. On Guillaume's death, the castle passed to his nephew, Antoine d‚ÄôOiselay. The barons of Oiselay kept Oricourt until the middle of the 17th century, but did not live there. After the Ten Years' War, Franche-Comt√© was devastated. The manor of Oricourt was put up for sale and taken by Claude Fran√ßois de Cordemoy in 1650. He lived here for 50 years. The last lord of Oricourt was the husband of Jeanne Claude de Cordemoy, Fran√ßois Gabriel, marquis of Chapuis After the Revolution, the town of Oricourt unsuccessfully asked the authorities to demolish the fortifications and fill in the ditches, symbols of feudalism. In the 19th century the castle and its land were taken over by the Grivel family, turning it into a simple farm. The grandparents of the present owner, Jean Pierre Cornevaux, acquired the property in 1932. Parts of the castle were protected as a monument historique on the list of the French Ministry of Culture since 1913, and in its entirety since 1984. The castle is open to the public.

The line left the Leeds and Bradford Extension Railway at Barnoldswick Junction from Earby railway station. The line through the junction was on a radius after which it converged to a single track and ran in a straight but undulating line to Barnoldswick. The passenger train that ran back and forth between Barnoldswick and Earby was known locally as the 'Barlick Spud' or 'Spudroaster'. The real reason for the name is lost in time, but the two versions that were commonly recited are that the original branch locomotive was so small it looked like a portable potato roaster used by a local vendor or that the journey time was the same as that taken to roast a potato in the locomotive's firebox. Barnoldswick has been in the Pendle District of Lancashire since 1974.  Opening  The line was built by the Barnoldswick Railway and worked by the Midland Railway from its opening on 8 February 1871. The Midland absorbed the Barnoldswick Railway in 1899.  Layout  = Station area = The station was at the end of a single line branch with a single platform on which was sited the stone and wood station building. The stone part being the original Barnoldswick Company‚Äôs building, the wooden parts being added in two stages by the Midland Railway. Also on the platform was a swan-necked water crane, originally fed from a large water tank in the coal yard but later connected to the town supply. At the opposite end of the platform to Barnoldswick Junction was a level crossing that gave access to the coal yard. Steps at the platform end gave access to the level crossing, there being no ramp at this end. The level crossing had to be used to run-round any train, the gates being opened & closed by hand. It was unusual in that when closed against the railway both gates swung to cover the platform side, the goods yard being left unprotected. = Goods yard = The goods yard was opposite to the platform. Against the level crossing was an end loading accessed from the run-round loop. Further from the level crossing was a large wooden goods shed that had been extended at some time and near to the station throat a platelayers' hut. Near this hut the lines led off to the goods shed, a siding that stopped short of the goods shed and a further siding that extended right past the goods shed to reach Wellhouse Road. Passing under Bridge No 10 (Rainhall Road) the line entered a cutting with a crossover to the main line and the start of a long headshunt. The crossover was controlled by a 2-lever ground frame open to the elements and unlocked by the key on the end of the Branch Staff. The headshunt was also used for storing the branch passenger stock. Bridge No 9 (Rook Street) crossed both the running line and the headshunt. The goods shed was demolished in the early 1950s. The line to the loading dock was retained as was the long siding but the other two were lifted. In the early 1960s the long siding was used for the storage of surplus suburban coaching stock. = Coal yard = At one time a large iron water tank on wooden legs stood in the coal yard adjacent to Station Road and next to the level crossing. A small collection of coal merchants' offices stood just inside the double entrance gates on an area that was part covered in setts. Only one siding could be accessed from the platform line so as to allow locomotives to run-round. All the others could only be accessed from the run- round loop. The 1892 Ordnance Survey map shows the goods yard to have been very short with a total of four sidings, none of them over 100 ft in length, the total capacity being twenty wagons. The 1909 map shows that three of the sidings have been doubled in length. They were extended again in 1913 as near as they could be to Skipton Road. This extension was built on an embankment so advantage of this was taken to build coal drops with road access from Skipton Road. A ground frame in a standard Midland Railway hut was situated just inside the goods yard near the level crossing but on the opposite side of the tracks to the coal offices. There was also a small engine shed built by 1880 that was a sub-shed to Skipton shed but this had closed by July 1912 to make way for extra coal sidings. The coal yard was one of the few places where the Midland Railway officially allowed its locomotives to tow wagons on an adjacent line by rope.  Signalling  Despite the station's size there was never a signal box. At the end of the platform was the only signal, a single crossbar stop signal topped by a lamp. This was hand operated from the base of the post and was not interlocked to any points or the level crossing gates. This signal however, for quite a period, was seldom used. Traffic The 1881 timetable shows that all trains were composed of both passenger carriages and goods wagons. Eight trains were run each way with no services running on a Sunday. The first train left Barnoldswick at 7.35 am and arrived at Earby at 7.43 am. The last train left Earby at 6.50 pm and arrived at Barnoldswick at 7.00 pm. The locomotive for these trains was shedded at Barnoldswick. Advertised excursions at this time show trains running from Barnoldswick to Leeds (en route to Scarborough) and back. Also the L&YR; ran excursions from Barnoldswick to Colne (en route to Blackpool) and back. These later trains saw L&YR; engines and stock at Barnoldswick. The 1903 timetable showed the number of trains as 11 during the week with two extra late trains on a Saturday from Barnoldswick and 10 during the week with two extra late trains on a Saturday from Earby. Whether these trains were still mixed trains isn‚Äôt known. The 1911 timetable shows a more frequent but complicated service with most trains running as passenger only, the actual number of trains varying depending on the day of the week. There were two trains that ran each way as mixed and two goods trains to, and three from, Barnoldswick. Sundays saw five passenger and two mixed trains to Barnoldswick with 6 passenger trains from but no mixed trains. The 1921 service was as frequent as the 1911 but simplified. 1929 saw 16 week-day departures plus a 'Tue and Fri only' train. Passenger numbers had fallen from 116,366 in 1928 to 104,638 in 1929 but in 1930 there was a huge fall to 63,608. This was caused by the opening of what is still known locally as 'the new road'in December 1929. This enabled Ezra Laycock to start a bus service from Barnoldswick via Salterforth to Earby. By 1934 the number of departures had risen to 24 departures. Sunday evenings saw 9 trains running but none during the day. Sunday services had ceased by 1939. The number of passenger trains was reduced until by 1956 it was down to 12 or so a day. From September 1956, however, it was reduced to just 1 in and 2 out per day. This later changed to just 1 in and out, plus a single mid-day goods train, that was the pattern maintained until the passenger service was withdrawn. The passenger trains were mainly for pupils at Ermysted's Grammar School and the Skipton Girls' High School, both in Skipton. The termination of these trains saw the last of any significant passenger numbers using the station. Excursion trains to the seaside and special trains for Skipton Gala were still run but had little or no advertising. Locomotives and stock The first locomotive allocated to the branch and the small engine shed was a 0-4-2WT. This was followed by an 0-6-0T and then an 0-4-4T. Goods and passenger trains were also handled by double-framed 0-6-0 and later single framed 0-6-0. These were all MR engines. Passenger stock was a mixture of 4 & 6 wheeled and bogie carriages. Steam train heating for the two locomotives and nine carriages allocated to the Barnoldswick branch was only authorised on 16 November 1922 ‚Äì 20 years after the Midland Railway had introduced it to their mainline carriages. The LMS, who had taken over the Midland Railway at the Railway Grouping in 1922, continued to use the MR 0-6-0T and 0-6-0 locomotives but also used LYR 2-4-2T for passenger trains. It introduced push-pull trains from 2 February 1931 in an attempt to reverse the downward trend in passenger numbers with the opening of the 'New Road' to Kelbrook. In later years the Ivatt 2-6-0 and 2-6-2T locomotives appeared as well as the ageing MR 0-4-4Ts. The Riddles variant of the Ivatt 2-6-2T also appeared at Barnoldswick. Excursion or special trains sometimes brought Fairburn 2-6-4T locomotives to the station. On one occasion Skipton shed used a Stanier 4-6-0 Jubilee class locomotive No. 45658 Keyes to work the morning train. Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) were used for the evening school train from September 1959 but the morning train remained steam to the end. The mid-day goods train was sometimes worked by LMS Fowler Class 4F locomotives.  Last trains  The last passenger train ran on 25 September 1965, with official closure coming on the 27 September 1965; the last coal train ran on 30 July 1966. Post-closure The station was subsequently demolished, a supermarket and car park being built on the site. The coal yard is now landscaped and a new road built across it. The goods yard wall is still standing and is the car park boundary. The platform retaining wall can be seen down the side of the supermarket. Above this wall the former Station Master's house built by the LMS is still occupied. The town War Memorial was moved down from Letcliffe Park and onto the area of the platform gates. Other proposals Several other railways were proposed which would have included a rail link to Barnoldswick. =Barnoldswick and Gisburn Light Railway= In May 1904, taking advantage of the 1896 Light Railways Act, the Barnoldswick and Gisburn Light Railway Company was formed. This company attempted to obtain powers to build a 3¬æ mile single track line from Barnoldswick to connect with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railways Chatburn to Hellifield line just north of Gisburn. Due to the L&YR; refusing to allow a junction near Gisburn the scheme was abandoned. A similar scheme put forward in 1913, but without a connection to the L&YR;, failed due to the First World War. = Blackburn, Clitheroe & North Western Junction Railway = The Blackburn, Clitheroe & North Western Junction Railway was given permission in 1846 to build a railway from Blackburn to Long Preston. The original plan included building a through station at Barnoldswick. This plan was abandoned in favour of the route that is now the Ribble Valley Line. = Fleetwood, Preston & West Riding Junction Railway = This railway line was proposed to have a through station in Barnoldswick near the junction with the Leeds & Bradford Extension railway in Elslack. This railway was also never built.

It was as a full-back, however, that he established himself ‚Äì and as a \\"footballing\\" defender, who preferred to pass his way out of trouble rather than kicking it downfield. He also spent hours practising heading the ball. Garrett made his debut for the Seasiders on 29 March 1948, in a single-goal defeat at Derby County. He did not become a regular in the side until Ron Suart left for Blackburn Rovers in 1949. The 1950s are the most successful decade in Blackpool's history to date. Garrett would be at the club playing top division football throughout, as would goalkeeper George Farm, fellow defender Hugh Kelly, right winger Stanley Matthews, forward Jackie Mudie and outside left Bill Perry. He could perform equally well on either flank, and played in both the 1951 and 1953 FA Cup Finals, appearing in the latter with a broken nose sustained a week beforehand. It was during this period of his career that he gained his England caps, partnering Alf Ramsey. He made his international debut against Scotland on 5 April 1952. After 14 years with Blackpool, Garrett joined Millwall on a free transfer in May 1961, making a dozen appearances for the Lions before retiring from the professional game and joining Fleetwood Town. He then played for a short time in Australia, with Mayfield United, and eventually settled there. He died on 16 April 2006 in Wallsend, New South Wales.

It is a medium-sized deciduous tree growing to tall with a broad, rounded crown. The bark is smooth on young trees, becoming shallowly ridged with age. The leaves are opposite, palmately lobed with five lobes, to long and to broad, with a to petiole; the lobes are usually entire, but occasionally with a pair of teeth on the largest central lobe, and the margin is often wavy. The petiole bleeds a milky latex when broken. The flowers are in corymbs, yellow-green with five petals to long; flowering occurs in early spring. The fruit is a double samara with two winged seeds, the seeds are disc-shaped, slightly flattened, to across. The wings are long, widely spread, approaching a 180¬∞ angle. The bark is greenish-grey, smooth in young trees, becoming shallowly grooved in mature. It is closely related to, and often difficult to distinguish from, Acer amplum, Acer cappadocicum, and Acer pictum subsp. mono, which replace it further south and west in China, and in Japan. From Acer cappadocicum it is best distinguished by the shoots which turn brown by their first winter, not remaining green for several years. From Acer mono (syn. A. pictum auct. non Thunb.) it is best distinguished by the larger, thicker (less flattened) seeds.

In this paper Berkson proposed an error model for regression analysis that contradicted the classical error model until that point assumed to generally apply and this has since been termed the Berkson error model. Whereas the classical error model is statistically independent of the true variable, Berkson's model is statistically independent of the observed variable. Carroll et al. (1995) refer to the two types of error models as follows: * error models including the Classical Measurement Error models and Error Calibration Models, where the conditional distribution of W given (Z, X) is modeled ‚Äî use of such a model is appropriate when attempting to determine X directly, but this is prevented by various errors in measurement. * regression calibration models (also known as controlled-variable or Berkson error models), where the conditional distribution of X given (Z, W) is modeled. Berkson is also widely recognised as the key proponent in the use of the logistic in preference to the normal distribution in probabilistic techniques.Lecture notes for Economics students at Sussex university. Online resource: Berkson is also credited with the introduction of the logit model in 1944, and with coining this term. The term was borrowed by analogy from the very similar probit model developed by Chester Ittner Bliss in 1934. Berkson was a prominent opponent of the idea that cigarette smoking causes cancer. In the 1957 Liggett & Myers annual report, he was quoted as saying \\"the evidence, taken as a whole, does not establish, on any reasonable scientific basis, that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.\\" Following the issuance of the famous report Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the United States, he was quoted in Life Magazine as saying it was \\"very doubtful that smoking causes cancer of the lung.\\" Notes Category:1899 births Category:1982 deaths Category:American statisticians Category:Johns Hopkins University alumni Category:Fellows of the American Statistical Association ","title":"Joseph Berkson"},{"id":"9875094","text":"Nicholas Angelich in 2008 Nicholas Angelich (born 1970) is an American pianist.

This butterfly is named for the explorer Ferdinand Magellan who was killed in the Philippines in 1521. Description :For terms see External morphology of Lepidoptera. As Pompeoptera Magellanus in Robert Henry Fernando Rippon's Icones Ornithopterorum (1898 to 1906) Male: The forewings are ground colour black. The veins are bordered by white. The underside of the forewings is very similar to the upperside, but some veins are bordered by yellow. The hindwings are golden yellow. The veins and the marginal edge of the hindwing are black. The golden area has an opal, green or blue colour at a certain angle. The underside of the hindwing is very similar to the upperside and also has the optical effect. The body (abdomen) is yellowish, but the underside is yellow. Head and thorax are black. Female: is sexually dimorphic. The female is larger than the male. The ground colour of the female is dark brown to black. The veins are bordered by white colour shading. There is a golden area with dark veins on the hindwings. At the edge there is a postdiscal chain of golden spots. The underside is very similar to the upperside. Troides magellanus at the angle at which iridescence appears. Same specimen as in the box above right. =Iridescence= T. magellanus shows a blue-green sheen if viewed from an oblique angle. Troides magellanus and the much rarer T. prattorum, are noted for their use of limited-view iridescence: the yellow of the dorsal hindwings is modified by bright blue-green iridescence which is only seen when the butterfly is viewed at a narrow, oblique angle. This \\"grazing iridescence\\" is brought about through diffraction of light (after back reflection) by the wings' extremely steeply set, multilayered rib-like scales (rather than the ridge-lamellae of most other iridescent butterflies, such as Morpho species). Such limited-view iridescence was previously only known from one other species, the lycaenid Ancyluris meliboeus. In A. meliboeus, however, the iridescence is produced by ridge-lamellar scales and features a wider range of colours.

The geison is the part of the entablature that projects outward from the top of the frieze in the Doric order and from the top of the frieze course (or sometimes architrave) of the Ionic and Corinthian orders; it forms the outer edge of the roof on the sides of a structure with a sloped roof. The upper edge of the exterior often had a drip edge formed as a hawksbeak molding to shed water; there were also typically elaborate moldings or other decorative elements, sometimes painted. Above the geison ran the sima. The underside of the geison may be referred to as a soffit. The form of a geison (particularly the Hawksbeak molding of the outer edge) is often used as one element of the argument for the chronology of its building.The geisa of the Doric porch of Philo at Eleusis are labeled as Œ≥Œµ·øñœÉŒ± ŒîœâœÅŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (horizontal geisa with mutules) and Œ≥Œµ·øñœÉŒ± ·º∏œâŒΩŒπŒ∫Œ¨ (vertical geisa without mutules) - Robertson 382.  Horizontal geison  Hephaisteion (temple of Hephaistos) in Athens, showing geisa. The horizontal geison runs around the full perimeter of a Greek temple, projecting from the top of the entablature to protect it from the elements and as a decorative feature.It may be compared to the eaves of modern structures. Horizontal geisa may be found in other ancient structures that are built according to one of the architectural orders. The horizontal sima (with its antefixes and water-spouts) ran above the horizontal geison along the sides of a building, acting as a rain gutter and final decoration. = Doric order = The underside of a corner horizontal geison block from Lycosura showing mutules with guttae In the Doric order, the sloped underside of the horizontal geison is decorated with a series of protruding, rectangular mutules aligned with the triglyphs and metopes of the Doric frieze below. Each mutule typically had three rows of six guttae (decorative conical projections) protruding from its underside. The gaps between the mutules are termed viae (roads). The effect of this decoration was to thematically link the entire Doric entablature (architrave, frieze, and geisa) with a repeating pattern of vertically and horizontally aligned architectural elements. Use of the hawksbill molding at the top of the projecting segment is common, as is the undercutting of the lower edge to aid in dispersing rainwater. In order to separate the geison from the frieze visually, there is typically a bed molding aligned with the face of the triglyphs. = Ionic and Corinthian orders = Horizontal geisa of these orders relied on moldings rather than the mutules of the Doric order for their decoration.  Raking geison  Arch of Hadrian. A raking geison ran along the top edge of a pediment, on a temple or other structure such as the aedicula of a scaenae frons (theater stage building). This element was typically less decorative than the horizontal geison, and often of a differing profile from the horizontal geison of the same structure. The difference is particularly marked in the Doric order, where the raking geison lacks the distinctive mutules. The raking sima ran over the raking geison as a decorative finish and, essentially, a rain gutter. See also * Glossary of architecture  Notes   References  *Robertson, D. S. 1943.

It was situated in the north-west of the island in the Akamas region, close to or under the present town of Polis. Both Strabo and Pliny the Elder mention the city in their writings. History See also Ancient history of Cyprus. Hellenistic limestone sarcophagus from Marion, Polis Museum tomb sculpture from Marion, Polis Museum unique styles of terracottas from tomb contents, Marion, Polis Museum Marion was already inhabited at the end of the Neolithic and through the Chalcolithic period. It began to prosper from the Cypro-Archaic period onwards and became one of the most important ancient Cypriot city--kingdoms in the Cypro-Classical period with important commercial relations with the East Aegean islands, Attica and Corinth. According to tradition, Athenian Acamas, son of Theseus, disembarked near Polis after the Trojan war and gave his name to the Cape of Akamas and the city of Akamantis, a legendary city which has never been found. Marion was probably founded by Acamas or a certain Marieus. In Egypt at Medinet Habu in the temples of Ramesses III, there is a large 12th-century BC inscription which refers to Cypriot towns including Marion. The Mycenaeans, or Achaeans settled in Cyprus between 1400 and 1100 BC and Marion was one of the city-kingdoms they founded. The city became wealthy from the nearby copper and gold mines. It also served as an important trading port for both metal and timber. The foundations of the ancient harbour are visible to this day in the current port of Latchi. The first definite reference to Marion occurred in 449 BC when Kimon, the great Athenian general, freed the city from the Persians following the Battle of Salamis and in an attempt to re-establish Athenian supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean. Later, the ancient geographers spoke of the town as \\"Marion Hellenikon\\"--The Hellenic Marion. The Kingdom was rich in gold and copper ore, mined chiefly in the nearby Limni Mines. It was the natural wealth which led the city to a period of flourishing trade, especially with Athens, which in its turn, exported many Attic pots to Marion. Samples of this pottery can be viewed at the Polis Museum. The battle for Cyprus between the successors of Alexander the Great, Antigonus and Ptolemy, led Marion to destruction in 312 BC. Ptolemy, who finally prevailed, laid waste the city whose last king (Stasioikos II) had taken the side of Antigonus, and transferred its inhabitants to Paphos. Later, another member of the Ptolemy dynasty, Philadelphus, founded a new city on the ruins of Marion in about 270 BC and gave it the name of his wife, Arsinoe.http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:id=marion The city, under its new name, prospered during the Hellenistic and Roman Ages.

Private Investigator! is an adventure story arc of the Philippine comic strip series Pugad Baboy, created by Pol Medina Jr. and originally published in the Philippine Daily Inquirer. This particular story arc lasts 77 strips long and ran July to October, 2000, in the light of the then-recent bombings in some shopping malls. In 2001, the story arc was reprinted in PB the 13th, the thirteenth book compilation of the comic strip series. The story arc's title comes from the fact that every time Dagul's alter ego Bardagul Kapote's name is mentioned by the unseen narrator, he always follows it with the phrase \\"Private Investigator,\\" which is what Bardagul Kapote is. \\"Kapote\\" is Filipino for raincoat and Bardagul's trench coat can serve the same purpose as a raincoat in the Philippine setting. Synopsis Dagul, Debbie, and their housekeeper Brosia are watching a very gory movie in a shopping mall cinema when suddenly, an explosion is heard, sending the other moviegoers into panic. In the aftermath of the explosion, Brosia helps the janitor collect the debris from the explosion, which originated from the women's restroom, into a garbage bag. Brosia and her masters take home the garbage bag, even before police could obtain any evidence from it. At home, Dagul tells Debbie that the garbage bag they took home might contain evidence related to the bombing. But examining it should be done by a very skilled detective. Dagul and Brosia then disappear and reappear as Bardagul Kapote, a trench coat-clad private investigator, and Brossy, his blonde secretary, both dressed in a 50s get-up. Bardagul then examines the contents of the garbage bag. The absence of shrapnel tells him that the bomb used in the explosion is not a fragmentation bomb and neither it is an incendiary bomb because the garbage is still intact. Bardagul also finds some receipts, a classified ad from a newspaper, a leaf, and a SIM card. He gets his cellular phone and inserts the SIM card. The SIM card is locked, but an acquaintance, Noks Ramos (Igno), manages to unlock it in only four seconds. Bardagul checks the SIM's log and calls the last number listed. The number leads to an Ilocano-speaking man. Since neither Bardagul nor Brossy can understand Ilocano and an interpreter is nowhere to be found, Bardagul hangs up. In the process, he finds out that the SIM is a prepaid one because its account has P460 left. Bardagul then has a K-9 detective (Polgas) examine the physical make-up to the piece of debris from the explosion, which is revealed to be made up of cellulose, ethanolamine, nitrogen tri-iodide and activated carbon. He also finds out from his snitches that the fireworks business in Bulacan is on the rise again despite being in the off season as pyrotechnics sales from that province are transacted in several restaurants in Quezon City. While about to go forward, and in an almost impossible instance, Brossy calls Bardagul through cellphone, even though he is yet to find out about its number. Back in the office, Brossy explains that the number of the SIM is the one posted on the classified ad. Furthermore, she tells him that fourteen of the contacts listed in the SIM are phone numbers to several fireworks factories in Bulacan. Based from the info, Bardagul deduces that the perpetrator of the bombing in the mall is a woman named Lita (the one mentioned by the Ilocano-speaking man earlier) and the explosive used in the bombing is a pyrotechnic device from Bulacan. He then asks for the receipts and the leaf that is among the evidence. The receipts have names of restaurants in Quezon City specializing in Ilocano cuisine and all of which list a dish called \\"inabraw nga saluyot.\\" The leaf happens to be a saluyot leaf, which is predominant in Ilocano dishes. Using the new information, Bardagul visits the Kaspagarigan Restaurant in Quezon City. He asks one of the crew about the receipt and the man remembers that in the Tuesday before, a female diner ordered \\"inabraw nga saluyot\\" and her male companion ordered \\"minatamis na langka\\" (sweetened jackfruit). The female diner then left, leaving the companion behind. One of the restaurant's guest relations officers later tells Bardagul that the male companion is from Bulacan who gave the female diner a box. The female diner also talked with the manager, telling him that she wanted to order a lot of goats for her farm in Laoag. As Bardagul is about to leave, a man points a shotgun at his back. But Bardagul uses some aikido to disarm the gunman and tosses him to the fence of the restaurant. Another member of the crew helps the man up and tells Bardagul that the man he has just manhandled is a security guard who may have mistaken him for someone else. Bardagul then leaves the scene and hides in the tall grasses surrounding the restaurant. While hiding, he peeks at the crew member who has just helped the gunman who threatened him. The crew member is dialing a phone, but Bardagul can't see the buttons because of his distance. Suddenly, Bardagul's cellphone rings, telling him that the man is calling him, thinking he is Lita, his main suspect. Bardagul disguises his voice (first by singing the Ilocano folk song \\"Pamulinawen\\") to a female one. Using this cover, Bardagul finds out that Lita is in vacation in Fort Ilocandia, a hotel resort in Ilocos Norte. He then packs up and drives twelve hours to the said hotel. Once at the hotel, he distracts the people at the concierge by telling them that Robin Padilla and Vina Morales are checking in just as he does. While the people at desk are running outside to look for the two actors, Bardagul checks the guest list and finds no one named Lita. He then checks the room service list and finds out that someone in Room 400 has ordered \\"inabraw nga saluyot.\\" So when the desk people return to their posts after their futile search, he asks the concierge to check him into Room 398 for \\"superstitious\\" reasons. Room 398 happens to be near Room 400, where Lita is supposed to be staying. He sets up a trap at the door to enable him to wake up at the moment Lita leaves the hotel. He then goes to sleep, tired because of the long drive. At four in the morning the next day, the trap sets off waking Bardagul up. He opens the door finding several goons about to beat him up with clubs. He takes care of each of them, but finds that Room 400 has been vacated. Furthermore, guns are beginning to cock. He plans to use his .38 revolver, but the goons' guns seem to be more powerful. So he escapes, while firing back at the goons. Bardagul's pistol is a special one because it carries eight bullets of different kinds: one blank bullet, two rubber-tipped ones, three brass-tipped ones, and two double-action ones. At this moment, he loads bullets that explode on impact and shoots the balcony where the goons are. He then drives off. While driving away, he tries to call Brossy, but there is no answer. Then, Bardagul remembers the address of the Ilocano-speaking man who talked to him days before. He is about to proceed and his cellphone rings again. It is one of the goons he has fought with earlier and he has kidnapped Brossy. Pretending to be Lita he tells the goon that he has done a good job and asks where he should drop the \\"hostage.\\" The goon tells him that he will drop the \\"hostage\\" in a warehouse in Balacad Road. The location is so detailed, Bardagul immediately realizes that the goons set him up. He then drives off. He parks near a perimeter fence behind Lita's farm. He crawls under the fence when the Ilocano-speaking man, whom he identifies as Abraham, finds him and asks him about his business in Abraham's farm. Bardagul tells Abraham that he is no robber and he is just finding Lita. The mere mention of Lita earns Abraham's ire and starts to say curses while his daughter, a familiar face to readers of the strip, tries to separate the two so Abraham can calm down. Abraham's daughter explains to Bardagul that her father pawned half of his land to Lita. When it was time to pay up, Lita did not return the land. In fact, when Lita was about to resell her land, Abraham borrowed some money to get the land back to him; Lita then stopped the sale. The daughter does not even know how Lita transferred the land deeds to her name. Bardagul tells Abraham's daughter that he is about to infiltrate the warehouse on Lita's land and he tells her to call the other farmers for help in case he needs it. Bardagul infiltrates the warehouse, breaks the lock and enters. Inside, he finds boxes of potassium nitrate, which can be used as ingredients for explosives. But for him, this is not enough evidence. So he searches for any box of \\"lolo thunder,\\" a powerful kind of firecracker, and finds one hidden among the boxes of potassium nitrate. While he photographs the evidence, someone is calling him. It is Lita's eight goons, holding Brossy hostage and are looking for him. One of them dials the number of Lita's SIM card and Bardagul's phone rings. In an attempt to distract the goons, he fires three shots to the roof. While the goons are looking away, Brossy kicks the goon holding her. She even imitates Trinity's kick in The Matrix on another guard. She then escapes while Bardagul fires exploding bullets on the boxes. But the theatrics stop when Brossy is once again captured, this time by Lita, who is really Abraham's daughter, former Lt.-Col. Violeta Kainam (the main antagonist of the story arc Col. Manyakis). She is accompanied by her partner, former Gen. Cresendo Lagumbay (alias Sendong Langib, her counterpart in the story arc Retraining). While the two ex-military officials tie Brossy and Bardagul up and introduce themselves, Brossy identifies Lagumbay as the big boss of Lucdet Security Agency. He clarifies that he is the big boss of forty security agencies, all of which hire ex-soldiers. Kainam explains to Bardagul that the boxes are laced with trinitrotoluene and she can even make bombs make from ordinary fireworks. She takes advantage of making and exploding them because mall security has again been relaxed. Lagumbay and Kainam decide to leave Bardagul and Brossy tied up and shoot each of them down using Bardagul's revolver. But before that plan is set into motion, several Ilocano farmers from Bacalad, led by Abraham, charge into the warehouse, having disabled the goons. In response, Lagumbay guns Brossy down, not realizing that he has fired a blank. While Lagumbay shoots relentlessly, Bardagul rolls on him, knocking him out. As the farmers, particularly Abraham, release Bardagul from the ropes, Bardagul sees a truck driving away. He throws a box of \\"lolo thunder\\" towards the truck and shoots using his revolver's double-action bullets (those that explode on impact). The truck is torched, but Lita is seen driving away the other way in a sports car. So he takes Brossy (who still thinks she is dead) and drives after her, even using nitro to get close to her faster. By the time they approach Vigan, Bardagul and Brossy realize that Kainam cannot be found. Brossy suggests that Kainam may not go to Manila, but Bardagul tells her that Kainam is going to Manila, but not by land. So they turn back. Calling the Laoag International Airport as Victoriano Lecaros, a member of Bongbong Marcos's staff, Bardagul finds out that a military flight is leaving the airport, bound for Manila, and a white sports car (Kainam's 1957 Corvette roadster) is found parked in the runway. They reach the airport as the military plane is taxiing in the runway. Brossy places two packs of TNT in Bardagul's trench coat pocket. Bardagul gives his car's cigarette lighter and she places it alongside the two packs. Brossy hangs the trench coat on plane's left hind wing and it explodes, disabling the tail rudder. The pilot (the goon whose right hand is bandaged) and Kainam alight from the plane to see the damage as Bardagul and Brossy restrain them. A third person comes out of the plane. It is the gunman whom Bardagul disarmed back in the Kaspagarigan Restaurant. The bandaged goon identifies the man as Melecio, a champion skeet shooter. So Bardagul throws another pack of TNT towards Melecio. Melecio aims and shoots it perfectly, even taunting Bardagul by telling him that TNT does not ignite by shotgun blast. Luckily, Brossy has lit a flare and like a bride tossing a bouquet, Brossy hurls the flare to Melecio's direction. The TNT spread upon the poor skeet shooter lights up, causing him to accidentally pull his rifle's trigger. The bullet from the rifle makes a hole on the plane's left engine. The plane's fuel, which is 100-octane gas, leaks from the wing and is about to explode. Worse, the plane is full of TNT. Sensing some danger, Bardagul and Brossy run off to their car, with Kainam and the bandaged goon joining them. They drive away from the plane as it blows up. Bardagul then turns over Kainam, Lagumbay, and their goons (Melecio included) to local authorities, as well as the evidence against them, except for the SIM card, which Bardagul plans to use up its balance first before surrendering it. Bardagul and Brossy then take time out in Pagudpud Beach in Ilocos Norte. There, Bardagul discusses the confirmed doubt that Lita's (Kainam) actions against her father, Abraham, are just an inside job because their farms are right next to each other and both have saluyot planted on them. So to make sure, he asked Abraham and the other farmers' help in staking Lita. He also explains that Kainam collaborated with Lagumbay in his security business to create terrorist threats on malls, forcing the mall owners to hire more guards, and lose money in the process. He also finds out that Brossy was kidnapped because she was flirting with a security guard, just as he suspected. They then return to Manila, having finished their mission. Trivia * The series mentioned Ilocano stereotypes like Pamulinawen, Ilocanos' love for inabraw, a dish with vegetables and fish sauce, Ilocano words and swear words, goats and other Ilocano-related stuff. * Bardagul never let go of the SIM with load, reasoning that he will use this, another Ilocano stereotype that they are frugal.

Its genome is a single stranded positive-sense RNA molecule, making the Mengoviruses a class IV virus under the Baltimore classification system. The genome is approximately 8400nt in length, and has 5‚Äô VG protein (Virus genome protein) and a 3‚Äô polyadenine tail. Mengovirus was isolated by George W. A. Dick in 1948, in the Mengo district of Entebbe in Uganda, from a captive rhesus monkey that had developed hind limb paralysis.  Structure  The Mengovirus is a non-enveloped virus which has a nucleocapsid made up of 12 subunits. The virion is 30 nm in diameter and displays icosahedral symmetry.  Gene Expression and Genome Replication  Once inside a host cell, the Mengovirus genome acts as a piece of mRNA and is directly translated by the host ribosomes in the cytoplasm. There is a large un-translated region at the 5‚Äô end of the RNA that has a ribosome binding site, removing the need of a cap. A single polypeptide is made and is cleaved into individual proteins by viral proteases. The genome is divided into three parts: P1, P2, and P3. P1 encodes the virus capsid proteins, P2 and P3 encode genes required for genome replication to occur. For replication to occur an intermediate double-stranded RNA molecule is made to be used as a template for the production of positive sense genomes.  Infection  Mengovirus is infectious to vertebrate animals, and has been isolated from mice and other rodents. It can also cause acute fever in humans. There is no specific treatment for a Mengovirus infection; although Persantine has been shown to inhibit its replication.http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/full/79/17/11062?view=long&pmid;=16103157 The illness is not severe enough to require vaccination. The Mengovirus is able to suppress the host's immune response by reducing the expression of Nuclear Factor kappa B using the 5‚Äô un-translated region.

Plot A new heavy metal band named Black Roses plays at a sleepy town called Mill Basin, causing the town's kids to turn into rockers. However, what the town does not know is that the band is also turning kids into demonic monsters. The soundtrack features many prominent bands at the time such as King Kobra, Tempest, Hallow's Eve, Lizzy Borden among others. Most of the music for the band \\"Black Roses\\" was performed by the members of King Kobra, with Mark Free on vocals, and Carmine Appice on drums.

After Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare which Fasano stated was shot for about 52,000 dollars and made \\"like $400,000 in sales.\\" Following this, Fasano stated that Shapiro Glickenhaus came to the director offering him $400,000 to make Black Roses. Fasano contradicted himself during promotion of the film, stating the films budget was slightly under one-million American dollars. The film was shot in Canada as distributors would get a better tax deal for films when shot there. Fasano stated later that the film was shot in Hamilton under the recommendation of Paul Mitchnick as he thought it resembled an American industrial town. According to director John Fasano, the owners of the house in Toronto that was used for Black Roses were in the middle of a divorce. When arriving for the last day of shooting at the house the crew arrived to it with all the doors locked and the lights out. The special effects artists hired for the film were Richard Platt and Michael Maddi after Fasano received a recommendation of them from Dick Smith. The special effects team felt they were pressured by the eight-week shooting schedule of the film. The opening scene with the demon band took three weeks to complete with Platt stating that team were \\"putting in 16 and 20-hour days.\\" Release An article in Fangoria originally had the film scheduled for theatrical release in Autumn 1988. Black Roses was released on home video by VPD in December 1988. The film was released on DVD in the United States by Synapse Films in 2007. =Soundtrack= The soundtrack was released on compact disc in 1988 by Metal Blade Records. In a review by Bradley Torreano of AllMusic, he commented on Black Rose's music stating that Drummer Carmine Appice, who put together the group and makes an appearance in the film, was weaker than his work with Rod Stewart and Ozzy Osbourne, and noting that the four songs contributed by Black Roses included \\"two dull party song\\" and that their tracks \\"are quite terrible\\" while noting that the power ballad \\"Paradise (We're on Our Way\\" was \\"oddly listenable\\".

The SCOR model describes the business activities associated with satisfying a customer's demand, which include plan, source, make, deliver, return and enable. Use of the model includes analyzing the current state of a company's processes and goals, quantifying operational performance, and comparing company performance to benchmark data. SCOR has developed a set of metrics for supply chain performance, and Supply Chain Council members have formed industry groups to collect best practices information that companies can use to elevate their supply chain models. This reference model enables users to address, improve, and communicate supply chain management practices within and between all interested parties in the extended enterprise.Poluha, Rolf G. Application of the SCOR model in supply chain management. Cambria Press, 2007. SCOR was developed in 1996Douglas M. Lambert. Supply Chain Management: Processes, Partnerships, Performance. 2008, p. 305.Peter Bolstorff, Robert G. Rosenbaum (2012). Supply Chain Excellence: A Handbook for Dramatic Improvement Using the SCOR. p. 9 by the management consulting firm PRTM, now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) and AMR Research, now part of Gartner, and endorsed by the Supply-Chain Council (SCC), now part of APICS, as the cross- industry de facto standard strategy, performance management, and process improvement diagnostic tool for supply chain management.  Pillars  The model is based on 4 major \\"pillars\\": * Process modeling and re-engineering * Performance measurements * Best practices * Skills =The process modeling pillar= By describing supply chains using process modeling building blocks, the model can be used to describe supply chains that are very simple or very complex using a common set of definitions. As a result, disparate industries can be linked to describe the depth and breadth of virtually any supply chain. SCOR is based on six distinct management processes: Plan, Source, Make, Deliver, Return, and Enable.L. Puigjaner, A. Espu√±a (2005). European Symposium on Computer-Aided Process Engineering-15. p. 1234.James B. Ayers (2006). Handbook of Supply Chain Management, Second Edition. p. 263 * Plan ‚Äì Processes that balance aggregate demand and supply to develop a course of action which best meets sourcing, production, and delivery requirements. * Source ‚Äì Processes that procure goods and services to meet planned or actual demand. * Make ‚Äì Processes that transform product to a finished state to meet planned or actual demand. * Deliver ‚Äì Processes that provide finished goods and services to meet planned or actual demand, typically including order management, transportation management, and distribution management. * Return ‚Äì Processes associated with returning or receiving returned products for any reason. These processes extend into post-delivery customer support. * Enable ‚Äì Processes being associated with the management of the supply chain. These processes include management of: business rules, performance, data, resources, facilities, contracts, supply chain network management, managing regulatory compliance and risk management. The process is implemented in Version 11 (Dec 2012). With all reference models, there is a specific scope that the model addresses. SCOR is no different and the model focuses on the following: * All customer interactions, from order entry through paid invoice. * All product (physical material and service) transactions, from your supplier's supplier to your customer's customer, including equipment, supplies, spare parts, bulk product, software, etc. * All market interactions, from the understanding of aggregate demand to the fulfillment of each order. SCOR does not attempt to describe every business process or activity. Relationships between these processes can be made to the SCOR and some have been noted within the model. Other key assumptions addressed by SCOR include: training, quality, information technology, and administration (not supply chain management). These areas are not explicitly addressed in the model but rather assumed to be a fundamental supporting process throughout the model. SCOR provides three- levels of process detail.W. Benton (2013) Supply Chain Focused Manufacturing Planning and Control. p. 291 Each level of detail assists a company in defining scope (Level 1), configuration or type of supply chain (Level 2), process element details, including performance attributes (Level 3). Below level 3, companies decompose process elements and start implementing specific supply chain management practices. It is at this stage that companies define practices to achieve a competitive advantage, and adapt to changing business conditions. SCOR is a process reference model designed for effective communication among supply chain partners. As an industry standard it also facilitates inter and intra supply chain collaboration, horizontal process integration, by explaining the relationships between processes (i.e., Plan- Source, Plan-Make, etc.). It also can be used as a data input to completing an analysis of configuration alternatives (e.g., Level 2) such as: Make-to-Stock or Make-To-Order. SCOR is used to describe, measure, and evaluate supply chains in support of strategic planning and continuous improvement. SCOR Process Framework In the example provided by the picture the Level 1 relates to the Make process. This means that the focus of the analysis will be concentrated on those processes that relate to the added-value activities that the model categorizes as Make processes. Level 2 includes 3 sub-processes that are \\"children\\" of the Make \\"parent\\". These children have a special tag ‚Äì a letter (M) and a number (1, 2, or 3). This is the syntax of the SCOR model. The letter represents the initial of the process. The numbers identify the \\"scenario\\", or \\"configuration\\". M1 equals a \\"Make build to stock\\" scenario. Products or services are produced against a forecast. M2 equals a \\"Make build to order\\" configuration. Products or services are produced against a real customer order in a just-in-time fashion. M3 stands for \\"Make engineer to order\\" configuration. In this case a blueprint of the final product is needed before any make activity can be performed. Level 3 processes, also referred to as the business activities within a configuration, represent the best practice detailed processes that belong to each of the Level 2 \\"parents\\". The example shows the breakdown of the Level 2 process \\"Make build to order\\" into its Level 3 components identified from M2.01 to M2.06. Once again this is the SCOR syntax: letter-number-dot-serial number. The model suggests that to perform a \\"Make build to order\\" process, there are 6 more detailed tasks that are usually performed. The model is not prescriptive, in the sense that it is not mandatory that all 6 processes are to be executed. It only represents what usually happens in the majority of organizations that compose the membership base of the Supply Chain Council. The Level 3 processes reach a level of detail that cannot exceed the boundaries determined by the industry ‚Äì agnostic and industry-standard nature of the SCOR model. Therefore, all the set of activities and processes that build ‚Äì for instance ‚Äì the M2.03 \\"Produce & test\\" process will be company-specific, and therefore fall outside the model's scope. =The performance measurements pillar= The SCOR model contains more than 150 key indicators that measure the performance of supply chain operations.Roland Zimmermann (2006), Agent-based Supply Network Event Management. p. 58. These performance metrics derive from the experience and contribution of the Council members. As with the process modeling system, SCOR metrics are organized in a hierarchical structure. * Level 1 metrics are at the most aggregated level, and are typically used by top decision makers to measure the performance of the company's overall supply chain. * Level 2 Metrics are primary, high level measures that may cross multiple SCOR processes. * Level 3 Metrics do not necessarily relate to a SCOR Level 1 process (PLAN, SOURCE, MAKE, DELIVER, RETURN, ENABLE). The metrics are used in conjunction with performance attributes. The Performance Attributes are characteristics of the supply chain that permit it to be analyzed and evaluated against other supply chains with competing strategies. Just as you would describe a physical object like a piece of lumber using standard characteristics (e.g., height, width, depth), a supply chain requires standard characteristics to be described. Without these characteristics it is extremely difficult to compare an organization that chooses to be the low-cost provider against an organization that chooses to compete on reliability and performance. One of the key aspects that needs to be considered is that the performance measurement and thus bench-marking is done at supply chain level and not at the organizational level. Supply chains are identified with an organization based on customers and products. An organization which is offering multiple products will have multiple supply chains. In fact the supply chain to deliver the material and then returns of the material from customer will also be different. SCOR Performance Attributes and Level 1 Metrics Then the supply chain which needs to be improved is identified, this could be based on multiple parameters highest profitable, loss making. Once the supply chain is identified then only the performance measurement and bench-marking are done. Please note SCOR might not have the bench-marking data for all kind of supply chain so one needs to check with them i.e. SCOR currently doesn't have data for \\"catering supply chain\\" in Airline industry. The point here is that SCOR is for improving supply chains in an organization and the premise is that if a single supply chain is improved it has ripple effect on the complete organization. Associated with the Performance Attributes are the Level 1 Metrics. These Level 1 Metrics are the calculations by which an implementing organization can measure how successful they are in achieving their desired positioning within the competitive market space. The metrics in the Model are hierarchical, just as the process elements are hierarchical. Level 1 Metrics are created from lower level calculations. (Level 1 Metrics are primary, high level measures that may cross multiple SCOR processes. Level 1 Metrics do not necessarily relate to a SCOR Level 1 process (PLAN, SOURCE, MAKE, DELIVER, RETURN, ENABLE). Lower level calculations (Level 2 metrics) are generally associated with a narrower subset of processes. For example, Delivery Performance is calculated as the total number of products delivered on time and in full based on a commit date. =The best-practices pillar= Once the performance of the supply chain operations has been measured and performance gaps identified, it becomes important to identify what activities should be performed to close those gaps. Over 430 executable practices derived from the experience of SCC members are available.Luis M. Camarinha-Matos, Iraklis Paraskakis, Hamideh Afsarmanesh (2009). Leveraging Knowledge for Innovation in Collaborative Networks. p. 112 The SCOR model defines a best practice as a current, structured, proven and repeatable method for making a positive impact on desired operational results.Wojciech Syrzysko (2006). Supply Chain Controlling: Integration von APS und SCOR Modell. p.33 * Current ‚Äì Must not be emerging (bleeding edge) and must not be antiquated * Structured ‚Äì Has clearly stated Goal, Scope, Process, and Procedure * Proven ‚Äì Success has been demonstrated in a working environment. * Repeatable ‚Äì The practice has been proven in multiple environments. * Method ‚Äì Used in a very broad sense to indicate: business process, practice, organizational strategy, enabling technology, business relationship, business model, as well as information or knowledge management. ;Positive impact on desired operational results The practice shows operational improvement related to the stated goal and could be linked to Key Metric(s). The impact should show either as gain (increase in speed, revenues, quality) or reduction (resource utilizations, costs, loss, returns, etc.). An example of how to use SCOR Example of supply chain Some additional descriptions for the supply chain SCOR improves on this by offering a \\"standard\\" solution. The first step is to recover the Level 1 and Level 2 process descriptions. Caption from SCOR 8.0 Completed mappings of the supply chain processes with SCOR SCOR thread diagram The example is of a simple supply chain. The picture alone cannot adequately describe what production strategy the manufacturing company has decided to adopt. It is no easier to figure out how the material is supplied from the two suppliers. For example, is the material delivered against a forecast or is it pulled based on real consumption? Even in its apparent simplicity this picture does not represent a standard. Without a more extensive description the picture does not help interpret what is actually happening in this supply chain. Descriptive text could be added to the images to help explain the whole process. In order to keep the example simple and direct, it focuses only on the central processes: Source, Make, and Deliver. This reflects the general practice of members who focus first of all on these three process scopes. Only in a second step do they apply Plan and Return to map all their supply chain processes. The description of the manufacturing company reads ‚ÄúManufacturing company That Produces against a 15-day forecast‚Äù. The key word here is ‚Äúforecast‚Äù. What is the SCOR scenario that resembles a production based on forecast? The answer is, M1 (Make build to stock). How does the company supply materials from the Far East? The box reads ‚ÄúSupplies raw materials in bulks from the Far East against a monthly forecast‚Äù. ‚ÄúForecast‚Äù is again the keyword. How a process of supply based on a forecast be represented? The process is ‚ÄúSource‚Äù. The picture from the SCOR manual shows that the process S1 ‚ÄúSource Stocked Product‚Äù exactly corresponds to the needs of this example. With the French supplier, the company ‚ÄúPulls components from France based on production volumes‚Äù. The key word here is ‚Äúpulls‚Äù, as it describes a \\"just-in- time\\" strategy adopted with this supplier. What is the syntax used by SCOR to represent a pull-mode supply? The Source process descriptions in SCOR 8.0 offers a description that resonates well with the needs of the example: S2 ‚ÄúSource Make-to-Order Product‚Äù. Lastly, the distribution strategy chosen by the manufacturing company is ‚ÄúShip weekly finished goods to a Distribution Warehouse based in Central Europe‚Äù. The description suggests that a weekly shipment is closer to a forecast-based rather than a just-in-time policy. A shipment is a delivery process, so we must look under the ‚ÄúDeliver‚Äù tree. By browsing the Level 2 processes in the model we must look for a process configuration that corresponds to the forecast-based policy. We find that in D1 ‚ÄúDeliver Stocked Product‚Äù. The SCOR paradigm demands that whenever a unit of the chain supplies, there must be some other unit that delivers. Similarly, any delivery process requires a correspondent supply process at the other end of the link. So the mapping of the processes of the supply chain is completed, and can be depicted as in the following illustration. We see now that we don‚Äôt need any more the descriptions in the boxes. By just reading the SCOR syntax we immediately capture the salient processes that occur in this chain. The syntax of the model allows ‚Äúto speak the same language‚Äù. As a matter of fact, if we were to use the ‚Äúorthodox‚Äù representation of a SCOR mapping, we would build a ‚Äúthread diagram‚Äù like the one in the below picture. This is perfectly correspondent to the initial geographical picture, but it contains much more embedded information (we can call it a meta-model) in a more structured and elegant way. The arrows themselves represent the direction of the material flow. References  Further reading  * * Rolf G. Poluha: Application of the SCOR Model in Supply Chain Management.

The holding company is located in Stolberg (Rhineland).  History  For twelve generations the Prym family has been operating from the city of Stolberg, Germany, making and marketing semi-finished copper and brass products as well as haberdashery. In the 17th and 18th century they contributed substantially to establishing the local brass industry and its development towards international reputation. Johann (c.1340-c.1420), whose name is documented in a medieval register in Aachen, is referred to as the oldest ancestor. In the middle of the 15th century Wilhelm, a goldsmith, is mentioned as an administrator of an Aachen citizen. He is considered the founder of the family tradition in metal manufacturing and trade. Due to the important zinc ore deposits of the region, the conditions for brass production were ideal at the time. Mainly Protestant families established through their skill and diligence the rapidly growing fame of brass and copper products from Aachen. At the beginning of the 17th century, the loss of the guild rights in Catholic Aachen forced the now homeless Protestant brass manufacturers to move. Eight families came to nearby Stolberg, a small settlement in the dukedom of J√ºlich-Cleve- Berg, the brass manufacturer Christian (1614‚Äì83) and his family being among them. In 1642 he settled down at Dollartshammer, the head office of the family company which is at the same location to this day. As his sisters Maria (bef.1610- 53) and Sara (1615‚Äì1696), he also married into the Peltzer family, one of the richest brass manufacturers of the region. Another sister, Catharina (1610‚Äì81), married Jeremias Hoesch (1610‚Äì53) in 1637. In the 19th century the Pryms produced the first finished products made not only of brass, but also of steel and iron in addition to the rolled material and wires made of the traditional copper alloys. Under the management of William (1811‚Äì83) the company entered a new era of success. His son Heinrich August (1843‚Äì1927) did his apprenticeship in Birmingham and used the knowledge acquired there to introduce mechanical manufacturing of metal haberdashery in Germany. Hans Friedrich (1875‚Äì1965), son of August, expanded the Austrian production and sales branches he had been leading since 1908, to a dominating position in the Austrian monarchy and the crown lands. In this period, in 1903, he made the ingenious improvement to the press fastener, already invented in 1885. ‚ÄùPrym‚Äù and ‚ÄùPrym‚Äôs Zukunft‚Äù (Prym‚Äôs future) became the earliest brand names of the 20th century, the stag ‚Äì featured in the family‚Äôs coat of arms ‚Äì with a needle in his antlers one of the most famous trademarks. In the following years, Hans‚Äô great commitment was to the export business. Thus, not long after World War One, he established a business in Schweidnitz (Silesia), a branch in Berlin for sales in the East, and a subsidiary in the USA. In 1932, he modernised the brass rolling mill in Stolberg established prior to the turn of the century, despite the general lack of orders. A decision that turned out to be economically extremely successful. During World War Two, the company produced turbine blades and war related materials in addition to its rolled materials, wires and haberdashery; however, Hans never became a member of the National Socialist Party. Following World War Two, the considerable possessions of the family and the company in Berlin, Eastern Germany, Poland and Belgium were lost. Despite initial problems, in the years following the war, Hans managed to expand the zip fastener business with the newly developed plastic zip, ‚ÄùPrymalon‚Äù, as an addition to the traditional products. In 1960, after prolonged negotiations, he was successful in buying back all Austrian properties and rights, which was of essential importance, particularly regarding the ‚ÄùPrym‚Äù brand name. His marriage to Russian-born Olga G√ºtschow (1884‚Äì1975) in 1903 produced six sons, four of whom worked in the company. From 1928-72, Hans-August (1904‚Äì82) was head of ‚ÄùWilliam Prym of America, Inc.‚Äù, while Axel (1907‚Äì89) and Dieter (born 1917) held leading positions in the Stolberg head office which was expanding towards the Far East and Central America. Following the withdrawal of the British group, ‚ÄùCoats Viyella‚Äù (1976‚Äì93, with a 25% participation), the descendants of Heinrich Augusts once again became sole owners of the family company, probably the oldest in Germany. After the strategically important sale of Prymetall (a leading manufacturer of semi-finished products of copper and copper alloys), the company as a holding is divided into three independent sectors with numerous subsidiaries both in Germany and abroad: Prym Consumer (sewing and needlework accessories), Prym Fashion (fastening systems and accessories), and Prymtec (contact and electronic components). Until today members of the Prym family are still involved in the management of the business. The family stands for continuity in the development of this group of companies.  Price fixing  In 2007 Prym was fined ‚Ç¨40M by the European Commission for its part in operating a price fixing cartel, along with YKK and Coats plc. Prym's fine was much less than the other companies' as it alerted the Commission to the wrongdoing.

The Church runs a conference venue at Tutzing called Evangelische Akademie Tutzing.Ev. Akademie Tutzing The most prominent churches of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria are St. Matth√§us Church in Munich and St. Lorenz Church in Nuremberg where new state bishops get inaugurated. Munich is predominantly Catholic, whereas Nuremberg is a Lutheran stronghold.  Some theological statements  The theological teaching goes back on Martin Luther. The ordination of women is allowed. The blessing of same-sex marriages has been allowed by the synod and depends on the local church administration.Bayrischer Rundfunk: Landessynode beschlie√üt Segnung von homosexuellen Paaren (german)  History  During the Protestant Reformation, Bavaria (consisting at that point only of what is today called Altbayern) remained predominantly Roman Catholic. In the early 19th century, the largely Protestant Palatinate and Franconia were annexed to the Kingdom of Bavaria, and all Protestant churches in the kingdom were administratively subordinated in 1817 to an upper consistory in Munich and an umbrella, the Protestant Church in the Kingdom of Bavaria (), was founded in 1821. At first, this church consisted of Lutheran and Calvinist congregations in today's Bavaria and congregations of united Protestant confession (as of 1817) in the then Bavarian Governorate of the Palatinate on the left bank of the river Rhine. Since 1848 the Palatine congregations formed a separate church body (United Protestant Evangelical Christian Church of the Palatinate (Palatine State Church)). Thus the church body renamed into Protestant State Church in the Kingdom of Bavaria right of the Rhine (). In 1918 the Calvinist congregations seceded and formed their own church, the Evangelical Reformed Church in Bavaria (which merged with the Evangelical Reformed Church in Northwest Germany in 1989 to form the Evangelical Reformed Church ‚Äì Synod of Reformed Churches in Bavaria and Northwestern Germany). So in 1921 the Protestant state church renamed into Evangelical Lutheran Church in Bavaria right of the Rhine when the new church constitution accounted for the Kingdom having become a republic and the Reformed congregations having formed their separate church body. On 1 April 1921 the Evangelical Lutheran State Church of Saxe-Coburg merged in the Bavarian church body. The number of parishioners amounted to 1,575,000 in 1925.Sebastian M√ºller-Rolli in collaboration with Reiner Anselm, Evangelische Schulpolitik in Deutschland 1918‚Äì1958: Dokumente und Darstellung, G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1999, (=Eine Ver√∂ffentlichung des Comenius- Instituts M√ºnster), p. 29. . During the struggle of the churches under the Nazi dictatorship the Bavarian Lutheran church body remained an intact church (), since the Nazi-submissive German Christians fraction remained a minority in the synod after the unconstitutional election imposed by Hitler on 23 July 1933. Nazi opponents, forming the Confessing Church, could act within the official bodies of the church. The prior name extension right of the Rhine was skipped in 1948, after Bavaria left of the Rhine, i.e. the Palatinate, had been seceded from Bavaria by the Allies in 1945.

Pre-wedding traditions =Rokka (pre- engagement)= Roka is one of the most significant ceremonies that take place before an Indian wedding. The engagement ceremony marks the union of both the bride and groom's family and friends. =Kurmai (engagement)= Engagement is a significant part of a Punjabi wedding. First, the girl is draped with a chunni (very decorative dupatta ), which is usually very ornate. In some families this chunni is a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation. She is also presented with jewelry, which her mother and sister- in-law help her wear. A tiny dot of henna paste (mehndi) is applied to her palm for good luck, and the function is sealed with the exchange of rings. The bride's father applies the tikka (forehead mark) to the groom's forehead and blesses him. Exchange of gifts takes place between the two families. Everyone present congratulates the couple by feeding them sweets. =Dholki/sangeet= There is a sangeet function hosted by the bride's family, in which just a few close members of the groom's family are invited. The bride's family play the dholak drums and sing songs in which they tease the groom and his family. Nowadays, people hire DJs and have a dance party, followed by dinner. A ladies sangeet/ cocktail is held for the bride and her bridesmaids. =Mehndi= The last major function before the wedding is decoration with temporary henna (mehndi) tattoos. This is often blended with the sangeet ceremony. Mehndi artists are called to the houses of the boy and girl and apply mehendi to the palms of the female family members, groom and the hands and feet of the bride. A basket containing Bindi and bangles is handed around so girls can choose those that match the outfit they plan to wear to the wedding. The Mehendi ceremony takes place in the atmosphere of a party. The bride and other ladies get mehendi (henna designs) done, on their hands and feet (most ladies get it done only on their hands but the bride gets it done on both hands and feet). For the bride the mehendi is sent by the future Mother in Law, which is beautifully decorated. Common rituals Rituals at the bride‚Äôs home Choora: On the wedding day the rituals at the girl's home begin with the Choora ceremony. The oldest maternal uncle and aunt play an important role in the performance of the ceremony. Choora is basically a set of Red bangles, gifted by girl's mama (mother's brother). People touch the choora and give their heartiest wishes to the girl for her future married life. Also, they sprinkle flower petals on the bride. After that, the girl's uncle, aunt, friends and cousins tie kaliras (silver, gold or gold plated traditional ornaments) to a bangle worn by the girl. Mayian ceremony Mayian: This is the preparation ceremony one day before a Punjabi wedding. This ceremony is an evening festival, at the couple's parental homes. It consists of many rites, the Batna, Choora, Jaggo fireworks and sometimes the Ladies Sangeet and Mehndi. The mayian happens the night before the wedding and is celebrated according to which part of Punjab the participants are from. Vatna/Haldi: Four lamps or diyas are lit and the bride sits facing them. Oil is constantly poured into the lamps, so that the glow from the diyas is reflected on her face. Vatna involves applying a paste made from turmeric powder and mustard oil all over the bride's body by her female friends and relatives. This is done to make the bride look more beautiful on the most special day of her life. This ritual demands that the bride stay at home in her old clothes for a couple of days before her wedding. Ubtan is supposed to bring a glow to the bride's and groom's body, especially on their faces. This tradition is also known as Shaint in some cultures. After this ritual, the bride and groom are constrained from meeting each other until the wedding ceremony. Punjabi shagun register Ghara gharoli: A decorated pitcher of water (ghadoli) is brought for the bride's bath by the bride's bhabi (brother's wife). In the ghara gharoli ritual, the bride's sibling or sibling's spouse visits the nearby temple and fills a pitcher with holy water. The girl is then bathed with this holy water. Thereafter, the bride wears her wedding attire. The ghara gharoli and the vatna ceremonies take place at the groom's house too. But over there, the groom's sister-in-law brings the pitcher of water. As per the tradition, their wedding dress is presented to them by their respective maternal uncles. Jaggo ceremony Jaggo: In this ceremony, the family dances and sings in the beautifully decorated wedding home. Jaggo is celebrated in the last hours of the night. They decorate copper or brass vessel called khadaa with diveh (clay lamps) and fill them with mustard oil and light them. The bride or bridegroom's maternal aunt (mami) carries it on her head, and another woman will carry a long stick with bells, shaking it. The women will then go into other friends' and families' homes; after being welcomed by sweets and drinks, they dance there and move on. It is a loud ceremony, filled with joy, dancing, fireworks, and food. It is also practised in Pakistan. Rituals at the grooms‚Äôs home Sarbala: A young nephew or cousin dons the same attire as the groom. He is called the sarbala/shabbala (caretaker of the groom) and accompanies him. Groom riding a horse with his sarbala Sehra: Like the bride's home, the Vatna and Ghara Gharoli are followed by the dressing up of the groom in his wedding attire. After the groom has dressed up in his wedding clothes, a puja is performed. Thereafter, the groom's sister ties the sehra on the groom's head. After the completion of Sehrabandi ceremony, all those who witness the function give gifts and cash to the boy as a token of good luck. A groom with sehra Varna is a ceremony that is supposed to ward off the evil eye. The groom's bhabi lines his eyes with surma (kohl). Ghodi Chadna is the final ceremony at the groom's place. The groom's sisters and cousins feed and adorn his mare. To ward off the evil eye, people use cash and perform the Varna ritual. The cash is then distributed among the poor. After this the boy climbs the horse and leaves his home for the wedding venue. Ghodi chadna Rituals at the marriage venue Punjabi groom at Milni Milni literally means \\"introductions\\". In a Sikh marriage, Ardas is performed by the person in charge of looking after the Sikh scriptures, followed by the formal introductions of senior men in the families. For example, both eldest chachas (father's younger brother) will come together and exchange garlands of flowers. In the Milni ceremony, the girl's relatives give shagun (a token of good luck) to the groom's close relatives in descending order of age. Cash and clothes are gifted. Jaimala/Varmala: After Milni, the bride and groom come in the center of the circle where the family is standing, and place a heavily made garland made of flowers- varmala on each other to state, they accept each other and will love and live together with one another. Friends and relatives of the bride and groom indulge in teasing and fun, to celebrate this happy occasion. An auspicious time or muhurat is chosen for the performance of wedding ceremony. Hindu bride and groom Kanyadaan and Phere: The bride's father puts a ring on the boy's finger and then he gives his daughter to the boy. This ritual is known as the Kanyadaan. It is after the kanyadaan that the pheras begin. The pheras take place in front of the sacred fire, agni. After this the groom applies Sindoor (vermilion) to the girl's hair partition and the Mangalsutra Rasam takes place where the groom ties a beaded necklace i.e. a mangalsutra to the girl's neck. When all these rituals are over, the couple gets up to touch the feet of all the elder members in the family and seek their blessings for a happily married life. In a Hindu Punjabi Wedding, Agni (sacred fire) is usually encircled seven times. laavaan at Sikh Anand Karaj In a Sikh wedding, the bride and groom will walk in tow around the Guru Granth Sahib four times, called laavaan. This signifies they not only accept each other as one soul in two bodies, but also as the Guru as the center of their marriage. Joota chupai literally means 'hiding the shoes'. The bride's sisters indulge in stealing of shoes. It is a fun tradition, in which the girls charge a fee for agreeing to return the shoes. They demand Kalecharis of gold for the bride's sisters and of silver for her cousins. Post-wedding rituals Ring finding ritual Vidaai/Doli: Vidaai marks the departure of the bride from her parental house. As a custom, the bride throws phulian or puffed rice over her head. The ritual conveys her good wishes for her parents. A traditionally sad ritual, here the bride says goodbye to her parents, siblings and rest of her family. Her brothers/male cousins then lead her to her husband, who waits to take her to his family home to begin her new life as a married woman. Her relatives throw coins in the wake of this procession. In keeping with tradition the mother in-law will often not come to the Doli and instead make preparations at home to greet the arrival of her son and new wife. The mother- in-law has a glass of water in her hand, which she circles 3 times around her bahu and then offers it to her to drink, as a symbol of her acceptance and blessing as her newest daughter. Rituals observed at the groom's house Reception at the boy's house: The newlyweds are welcomed in a ceremony called the pani bharna. Then the bride must, with her right foot, kick the sarson ka tel (mustard oil) that is put on the sides of the entrance door before she enters the house. Then, along with her husband, she must offer puja in their room. Then they must touch the feet of the elders in a ceremony called matha tekna. The rest of the evening is spent playing traditional games. Phera Dalna: The newly weds visit the bride's parents on the day after the wedding. The bride's brother usually fetches them.

Note the ribs that go across the ribbon. Grosgrain ribbons in various colors and widths Grosgrain (, , also sometimes pronounced , ), is a type of fabric or ribbon defined by the fact that its weft is heavier than its warp, creating prominent transverse ribs. It is called a \\"corded\\" fabric since the weft resembles a fine cord. Grosgrain is a plain weave corded fabric, with heavier cords than in poplin but lighter than in faille.Kate Heinz Watson, Textiles and Clothing American School of Home Economics, Chicago: 1907: pp 91 Grosgrain has a very dull appearance with little luster but is very strong. It is a firm, close-woven, fine-corded fabric. Grosgrain fabric is most commonly available in black, but grosgrain ribbon comes in a large variety of colors and patterns. The ribbon is very similar to Petersham ribbon in its appearance, but it does not have the ability to follow the curves of a surface or edge the way that the latter does. \\"Grosgrain\\" is commonly used to refer to a heavy, stiff ribbon of silk or nylon woven via taffeta weave using a heavy weft which results in distinct transverse ribs. Historically grosgrain was made from wool, silk, or a combination of fibers such as silk and wool or silk and mohair. When a combination of fibers was used, the end result was sometimes given the name grogram, silk mohair, gros de Tours or gros de Napels.Cheney Brothers, James Chittick, Emanuel Anthony Posselt, Berlitz Schools of Languages, A glossary of silk terms, including a short history of silk: its origin, culture and manufacture Cheney Brothers: 1915 Etymology Grosgrain is both a direct French loan word and a folk corruption of the French word grogram.Joseph Shipley, Origins of English Words, JHU Press: 2001 , 671 pages: pp 121 Grogram, originally gros gram (appeared in literature in 1562), is defined as a coarse, loosely woven fabric of silk, silk and mohair, or silk and wool.Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary, Merriam-Webster Inc: pp 551 The adjective gros means thick or coarse, originally from the Old French gros, itself derived from the Latin grossus.Ernest Weekley, An Etymological Dictionary of Modern English, Courier Dover Publications: 1967, : pp 668 \\"Grain\\" is derived from Old French graine, itself derived from the Latin grana (plural of granum) ‚Äì seed or in some contexts texture.\\"Grosgrain\\". The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. Thus gros gram, grogram and grosgrain are all one and the same: a large grain hence coarse texture, thence a coarse- textured fabric.Charles Talbut Onions, George Washington Salisbury Friedrichsen, R. W. Burchfield, The Oxford dictionary of English etymology, Clarendon P.: 1966: 1025 pages Moire Moire is a waved or watered effect produced especially on grosgrain silk and woolen moreen via engraved rollers and high pressure on carded material. The end result is a peculiar luster which works best when made from a corded fabric like grosgrain. During the Middle Ages, moire was held in high esteem and was, as currently, used for women's dresses, for capes, and for facings, trimmings, etc.William Dooley, Textiles for Commercial, Industrial and Domestic Arts Schools, D. C. Heath & Company: 1910: pp. 223 Use in clothing =History= Throughout the 17th century, grosgrain fabric was used as the fabric body (corpus) for many garments, including waistcoats, jackets, petticoats, beeches, sleeves, jerkins and many other items of clothing, as a cheaper alternative for the lower socio-economic demographic than fine-woven silk or wool. In the 1740s Admiral Edward Vernon, who was known as \\"Old Grog\\" because he preferred a grosgam cloak to a more expensive variety, introduced the Rum ration in the British Royal Navy. It's from his attire that the naval term grog is derived. Factories in America started to produce grosgrain silk in the late 19th century.Zelma Bendure, Gladys Bendure Pfeiffer, America's fabrics: origin and history, manufacture, characteristics and uses, The Macmilln Company: 1946, 688 pages Throughout the 1920s the term seems to have remained true to original definition as a garment fabric.Ellen Beers McGowan, Charlotte Augusta Waite, A.. Textiles and clothing, Macmillan: 1919: 268 pages However, circa 1920s it fell out of favor as a garment fabric and was defined identically to contemporary terminology as a grosgrain ribbon. While grosgrain fabric is almost always black, grosgrain ribbon comes in a large variety of colors and printed patterns. The most common contemporary use of ribbed grosgrain is in hems where it may be elasticized or not, especially of polo shirts, T-shirts and underwear. Grosgrain that does have some luster is a very popular fabric especially for ribbons, which are used to ornament and decorate clothing. As grosgrain has less luster than burnished silk or satin it is very popular with and common in evening wear because it is seen as less \\"flashy\\", though silk and satin (which is a different weave, as opposed to a fiber such as silk) can commonly be found on day wear. Although grosgrain may actually be made of silk, it is often erroneously referred to as a separate fabric. =Structural uses= Lustrous grosgrain is used extensively to join female semi-detached clothing articles such as bodices to skirts and similar, where this necessary joint may be visible.McCall's Sewing Book, Random House: 1968: 198, 224 Ribbed grosgrain may be used similarly to twill tape for internal gussets and reinforcements. Grosgrain ribbon is often used for facings and for waistbands. Using a grosgrain ribbon facing for waistbands is faster and uses less fabric. It is also works especially well with bulky fabrics. McCall's Sewing Book states: \\"grosgrain ribbon is used with any heavy fabric to reduce bulk\\" though it may be the word \\"bulk\\" is used in the sense of outward appearance, rather than actual mass. McCall elaborates: \\"grosgrain is used to finish the back of novelty braid or to face the back of any fabric belt.\\"McCall's Sewing Book, Random House: 1968, 308 pages: pp 226 =Evening wear= As a more subtle option to lustrous satin, grosgrain is very popular with evening wear, used on the facings of lapels of most dress coats and high-end dinner jackets and tuxedos. Grosgrain is traditionally used to hem and highlight the cut of lapel, collar and visible outermost edges of the formal frock coat and the later morning coat.Natalie Rothstein, Victoria and Albert Museum, Madeleine Ginsburg, Victoria and Albert Museum. Dept. of Textiles and Dress, Avril Hart, Philip Barnard, Valerie D. Mendes, Four hundred years of fashion: The Victoria and Albert Museum: Department of Textiles and Dress, Edition 2, Victoria and Albert Museum: 1992, , 176 pages, pp 174 Hemmed frock-coats, as described, may be seen in the film Gone with the Wind noted for its historically accurate costume.Cynthia Marylee Molt, Gone with the Wind on film: a complete reference, McFarland & Co: 1990 , 512 pages, pp. 150: \\"Jonas Wilkinson coat- dark-grey broadcloth. worn. Frock Coat. Double breasted, hemmed in black grosgrain\\" Grosgrain is preferred over satin for practicality‚Äîit does not wear as easily as delicate silk or satin, as the threads do not snag as easily (on a ring or keys, for instance). Grosgrain is also used for matching accessories such as bow ties and cummerbunds, though these are often in barathea to complement the main suiting while still avoiding the glare of satin, increasingly gaining a 'flashy' image. =Millinery= Grosgrain is also used in millinery. Grosgrain ribbons are popular creating ribbon decorations for hats (made into flowers, for example), however grosgrain is most notably used in top hats and opera hats, or as the trimming band on the Homburg.Zelma Bendure, Gladys Bendure Pfeiffer, America's fabrics: origin and history, manufacture, characteristics and uses, The Macmillan Company: 1946, 688 pages. Other uses =Book-binding= Grosgrain fabric and ribbon are common structural fabrics for the joining or reinforcement of spines or sheaves in fine commercial and hobby book-binding and book restoration. =Cargo and packing use= A particular characteristic of grosgrain ribbon is that the thicker weft resists longitudinal curling and so it exerts an even pressure when tied around crushable materials. Nylon grosgrain is often used as heavy- duty webbing or binding around luggage, packs, messenger bags and other heavy use \\"soft\\" goods. It is also used for securing cargo. It can be dyed and is available in a variety of colours (though again usually black). Early seat belts and military webbing of every sort during World War II were made of grosgrain hemp, jute and linen. =Craft= Grosgrain made out of cotton or low-cost synthetic such as polyester is very common for gift-wrap ribbons, or for decorating and ornamenting scrapbooks and greeting cards. It can be used for many different crafts as well, from bead making, to book-binding, to trimming or embellishing, as well as a multitude of other uses. Grosgrain ribbon is the primary ribbon material used in the hair bow industry. =Lanyards= Grosgrain out of cotton or low-cost synthetic such as polyester is very popular for use as a lanyard, and is often printed on by large corporate companies to use as a marketing or branding tool to promote their companies. =Percussion= Polyester grosgrain in a 5/8-inch width can be used as the tensioning material attaching the snares of a snare drum to the throw-off mechanism, with the ribbing providing good insurance against slippage. Some like to use it in an attempt to lessen sympathetic snare buzz from external sources as it will hold the tab ends of the snares closer to the head than string and it will provide more dampening than mylar straps.

He played for 15 seasons as a catcher in Major League Baseball in and from to , most notably for the Kansas City/Oakland Athletics and the Minnesota Twins. Although Roof didn't produce impressive offensive statistics, he excelled defensively as a catcher which enabled him to sustain a lengthy career in the major leagues due to his valuable defensive abilities. He was the first player acquired by the expansion Toronto Blue Jays. Early years Roof was born in Paducah, Kentucky. He signed with the Milwaukee Braves in 1959 upon graduation from St. Mary High School. His brother, Paul, a pitcher, signed with the Braves out of high school the following year. After two minor league seasons in which he batted .236 with eleven home runs, Phil Roof debuted with the Braves at just nineteen years of age as a September call-up in 1960, but did not appear in a game. The following season, he made his major league debut on April 29, catching the ninth inning of a 7-3 loss to Juan Marichal and the San Francisco Giants. He saw action immediately, as the Giants half of the ninth ended with Roof tagging out Jim Davenport on a play at the plate. However, he did not get the opportunity to bat, and was left standing in the on-deck circle when the game ended. After appearing in just the one game, he was optioned to the Yakima Braves of the Northwest League on the cutdown date. Roof again appeared in a single game for the Braves in 1964, this time starting the game behind the plate and making two plate appearances. Roof finished the season with the Denver Bears, and was traded to the Los Angeles Angels with Ron Pich√© for a player to be named later (relief pitcher Dan Osinski) at the end of the season. While he appeared in just two games with the Braves, he provided his original franchise with a memorable moment off the field when he and future Baseball Hall of Famer Warren Spahn were arrested at a Houston night club a week into the season. Roof appeared in nine games for the Angels in 1965 before he was shipped to the Cleveland Indians at the trade deadline for a player to be named later (this time, outfielder Bubba Morton) and cash. He finished the season with the Indians, batting .162 with three runs batted in between his two clubs. At the Winter meetings, he and Joe Rudi were traded to the Kansas City Athletics for Jim Landis and Jim Rittwage. Kansas City/Oakland Athletics Roof got off to a fast start with his new franchise, and soon won the starting catching job over incumbent Billy Bryan. His first major league home run was an extra innings game winner against the Washington Senators on May 23, 1966. A week later, he broke up a Denny McLain no-hitter with a two-run double. For the season, he posted career-highs in games played (127), hits (77), doubles (14) and RBIs (44). Roof remained the Athletics' starting catcher until a torn muscle in his left shoulder early in the 1968 season limited him to just 34 games the Athletics' first season in their new home, Oakland, California. He returned to starting duties in 1969, but was traded to the Seattle Pilots in January in a package for All-Star first baseman Don Mincher. Milwaukee Brewers/Minnesota Twins The Pilots moved to Milwaukee during spring training, 1970, and were renamed the Milwaukee Brewers. The Brewers narrowly avoided 100 losses in 1970 despite the fact that Roof hit a career-high thirteen home runs. He suffered a concussion early in the 1971 season after getting hit on the helmet by a pitch thrown by Minnesota Twins pitcher Bert Blyleven. Ironically, Roof was dealt to the Twins for fellow catcher Paul Ratliff three months later, and caught Blyleven in his second game with the Twins. Roof spent most of his five seasons in Minnesota as the back up to Glenn Borgmann. He had his only career multi-home run game on May 30, 1972 against the Kansas City Royals, and had arguably his best season in a back up role in 1975, when he batted .302 with seven home runs and 21 RBIs in 63 games. Chicago White Sox/Toronto Blue Jays When top prospect catcher Butch Wynegar joined the Twins for the 1976 season, Roof became the odd man out, and was eventually placed on waivers and selected by the Chicago White Sox. Roof became the first player for the Toronto Blue Jays when they acquired him for a player to be named later two weeks before the 1976 Major League Baseball expansion draft. The player they eventually named was pitcher Larry Anderson. Roof only played in 3 games for the Blue Jays, appearing in his final major league game on May 30, 1977 at the age of 36, although he remained with the club as a bullpen catcher / coach throughout the season. Career statistics In a fifteen-year major league career, Roof played in 857 games, accumulating 463 hits in 2,151 at bats for a .215 career batting average along with 43 home runs, 210 runs batted in and an on-base percentage of .283. He ended his career with a .986 fielding percentage. Roof was a good defensive player with a strong throwing arm, finishing second among American League catchers in caught stealing percentage in with a 48.8% success rate. Coaching and managing career Roof also served as bullpen coach for the San Diego Padres (1978), Seattle Mariners (1983‚Äì88) and Chicago Cubs (1990‚Äì91). He managed for 16 years in the Twins organization and won his 1000th game as a manager in before his retirement in . Roof served as bullpen coach for the Minnesota Twins during spring training and the first month of the 2011 season while Rick Stelmaszek was recovering from eye surgery. Personal life Roof‚Äôs first wife, Marie, died after a lengthy cancer battle in 2005 while he was managing the Rochester Red Wings, Minnesota‚Äôs Triple-A affiliate. They had been married 41 years with four daughters, then later married his second wife, Linda, in 2007. They have seven children and seventeen grandchildren between them. His brother, Gene, played in the majors from through , and later was an MLB coach and minor-league manager and instructor for the Detroit Tigers. In addition to Paul and Gene, brothers Adrian and David played professional baseball. Gene's sons Shawn and Eric were infielders in the Tigers' organization, and Gene's son, Jonathan, an outfielder and infielder, had a seven-year pro career. Shawn Roof was the 2019 manager of the Visalia Rawhide, a minor-league affiliate of the Arizona Diamondbacks. The elder Roofs' first cousin, Eddie Haas, is a former major league player, coach, scout and manager; another cousin, Louis Haas, played minor league baseball.

It contains eight full page miniatures; four Evangelist portraits and four pictures of their symbols (the eagle, angel, lion, and bull), the latter the earliest known Russian full-page examples. The angel is attributed to Andrei Rublev, and is the only illumination usually attributed to him, although some art historians incline to attribute at least all the full-pages miniatures to him.Popova (op cit) for one All the initials are painted in colour and gold, and many pages are richly ornamented. The style is elegant with light colours and expressive faces.Popova, Olga, Russian Illuminated Manuscripts, Thames & Hudson, London (or Braziller NY), 1984, nos 36-39 The gospel takes its name from Bogdan Khitrovo, a powerful boyar who obtained the manuscript from Tsar Fyodor III.

Members of the Religious Society of Friends settled on Quaker Hill in the 1730s and sought permission to establish a meeting and build a meeting house in 1740. The first meeting house was constructed across from the present building in 1742, but as membership grew, this building became too small and in 1763, the Yearly Meeting decided to erect \\"a framed house of timber, the dimensions to be long, wide and stud to admit of galleries.\\" This new house was built in 1764 and is the structure that has remained on the site since. Benjamin Sherman, carpenter of Quaker Hill, is credited with building the new Hicksite Meeting House in 1764.https://archive.org/details/recordsofsherman00sher/page/20 Records of the Sherman Family, as relating to the ancestors and descendants of Benjamin Sherman, from Henry Sherman, county of Suffolk, England, down to the 13th generation, by David H.

After years of discussion, the question was answered in 1776 by the resolution that meetings were not to accept financial contributions or services from members owning slaves. During the American Revolutionary War a portion of the Continental Army camped in the nearby hills, both during the fall of 1778 and the winter of 1779. The meeting house was commandeered by General Washington's officers to be used as a military hospital. In 1828, the New York Meeting of the Society of Friends split into the Orthodox and Hicksite Societies of Friends. From then on, the Hicksites used the Meeting House, and the Orthodox Society, which had fewer members, built its own meeting house in 1831, just to the northwest. The latter building was later converted into a private residence. Interior Membership in the area's Society of Friends declined in the course of the 19th century and the meetings were \\"laid down\\" in 1885. The property was acquired by the Historical Society of Quaker Hill and Pawling in 1936 which has preserved the building since then. The building is a two-story building, five bays wide and two bays deep. Inside the shingled structure, there are sliding panels which divide the men's and women's portions of the building. As with most meeting houses, there are two front doors, one for each gender. Location The Meeting House is located on the north side of Meeting House Road, about 100 meters from where it branches off from Quaker Hill Road, in the Hamlet of Quaker Hill, Town of Pawling, NY 12564.

It is located west-northwest of Finley, North Dakota. It was closed in 1979 by the Air Force, and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Ground Equipment Facility.  History  Finley Air Force Station was part of the last batch of twenty-three radar stations constructed as part of the Air Defense Command permanent network. It was activated in April 1951, and declared completely operational in late 1952, and initially the station functioned as a Ground control intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The 785th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron began operations with an AN/FPS-3 search radar and AN/FPS-4 from the site in April 1952. In 1957 an AN/FPS-6 replaced the AN/FPS-4 height-finder radar, and an AN/FPS-8 search radar saw brief service. At the end of 1958 this site was operating an AN/FPS-20 radar. A second height-finder (AN/FPS-6B?) was added during 1959. At the end of 1959 Finley AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-20 at Malmstrom AFB, Montana. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 785th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 January 1960. SAGE data was switched to DC-10 at Duluth AFS, Minnesota in 1963. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In 1962 Finley operated an AN/FPS-35 search radar plus AN/FPS-6 and AN/FPS-90 height-finder radars. The AN/FPS-6 was removed in 1969. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In addition to the main facility, Finley operated four unmanned AN/FPS-14 (P-29A/B) and AN/FPS-18 (P-29C/D) Gap Filler sites: * Sheyenne, ND (P-29A) * Grafton, ND (P-29B) * Valley City, ND (P-29C) * Middle River, MN (P-29D) The Ground to Air Transmitter-Receiver (GATR) facility was located off-station at , roughly one mile northwest of the main station. Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. The site was transferred to the Tactical Air Command in October 1979 with the inactivation of Aerospace Defense Command, being assigned to ADTAC. The 785th Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated, and radar operations at Finley AFS (Z-29) ceased, on 30 December 1979 when a new Joint Surveillance System (JSS) was activated at the former GATR site about a mile to the northwest. The new Finley JSS site (Z-303/J-75) began operations with an FAA ARSR-3 search radar and an Air Force AN/FPS-116 height-finder radar (removed c. 1988). That site now operates an ARSR-4. The main station equipment, buildings, fixtures, furnishings, and land was auctioned off in public auction on 9 July 2000. It is now being demolished.

It has its starting point in the stochastic production frontier models simultaneously introduced by Aigner, Lovell and Schmidt (1977) and Meeusen and Van den Broeck (1977). The production frontier model without random component can be written as: y_i = f(x_i ;\\\\beta ) \\\\cdot TE_i the best where yi is the observed scalar output of the producer i, i=1,..I, xi is a vector of N inputs used by the producer i, f(xi, Œ≤) is the production frontier, and \\\\beta is a vector of technology parameters to be estimated. TEi denotes the technical efficiency defined as the ratio of observed output to maximum feasible output. TEi = 1 shows that the i-th firm obtains the maximum feasible output, while TEi < 1 provides a measure of the shortfall of the observed output from maximum feasible output. A stochastic component that describes random shocks affecting the production process is added. These shocks are not directly attributable to the producer or the underlying technology. These shocks may come from weather changes, economic adversities or plain luck. We denote these effects with \\\\exp \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {v_i } \\\\right\\\\\\\\}. Each producer is facing a different shock, but we assume the shocks are random and they are described by a common distribution. The stochastic production frontier will become: y_i = f(x_i ;\\\\beta ) \\\\cdot TE_i \\\\cdot \\\\exp \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {v_i } \\\\right\\\\\\\\} We assume that TEi is also a stochastic variable, with a specific distribution function, common to all producers. We can also write it as an exponential TE_i = \\\\exp \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ { - u_i } \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where ui ‚â• 0, since we required TEi ‚â§ 1. Thus, we obtain the following equation: y_i = f(x_i ;\\\\beta ) \\\\cdot \\\\exp \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ { - u_i } \\\\right\\\\\\\\} \\\\cdot \\\\exp \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {v_i } \\\\right\\\\\\\\} Now, if we also assume that f(xi, Œ≤) takes the log-linear Cobb‚ÄìDouglas form, the model can be written as: \\\\ln y_i = \\\\beta _0 + \\\\sum\\\\limits_n {\\\\beta _n \\\\ln x_{ni} + v_i - u_i } where vi is the ‚Äúnoise‚Äù component, which we will almost always consider as a two- sided normally distributed variable, and ui is the non-negative technical inefficiency component. Together they constitute a compound error term, with a specific distribution to be determined, hence the name of ‚Äúcomposed error model‚Äù as is often referred. Stochastic Frontier Analysis has examined also \\"cost\\" and \\"profit\\" efficiency (see Kumbhakar & Lovell 2003). The \\"Cost frontier\\" approach attempts to measure how far from full-cost minimization (i.e. cost-efficiency) is the firm. Modeling-wise, the non-negative cost- inefficiency component is added rather than subtracted in the stochastic specification. \\"Profit frontier analysis\\" examines the case where producers are treated as profit-maximizers (both output and inputs should be decided by the firm) and not as cost-minimizers, (where level of output is considered as exogenously given). The specification here is similar with the \\"production frontier\\" one. Stochastic Frontier Analysis has also been applied in micro data of consumer demand in an attempt to benchmark consumption and segment consumers. In a two-stage approach, a stochastic frontier model is estimated and subsequently deviations from the frontier are regressed on consumer characteristics (Baltas 2005). Extensions: The two-tier stochastic frontier model Polacheck & Yoon (1987) have introduced a three-component error structure, where one non-negative error term is added to, while the other is subtracted from, the zero-mean symmetric random disturbance. This modeling approach attempts to measure the impact of informational inefficiencies (incomplete and imperfect information) on the prices of realized transactions, inefficiencies that in most cases characterize both parties in a transaction (hence the two inefficiency components, to disentangle the two effects). Recently, various non-parametric and semi-parametric approaches were proposed in the literature, where no parametric assumption on the functional form of production relationship is made, see for example Parmeter and Kumbhakar (2014) and Park, Simar and Zelenyuk (2015) Park, B., Simar, L. and V.

Born in New York City, he was the son of James Boulter and Caroline Stokes. His paternal grandfather was London merchant Thomas Stokes, one of the 13 founders of the London Missionary Society. His maternal grandfather, Anson Greene Phelps, was a New York merchant, born in Connecticut and descended from an old Massachusetts family. Career =Phelps, Dodge & Co.= Stokes‚Äôs early education was by tutors from the Union Theological Seminary who instructed him in mathematics, Latin and Greek. He then attended private schools in New York before joining the family business of Phelps, Dodge & Company in 1855 when he was 17. The company was a mercantile establishment founded in 1834 by his grandfather Phelps and his uncles, William Earle Dodge and Daniel James. His father James Stokes was also a partner at this time, having joined in 1847. The company began importing and trading in metal from England and exporting cotton in return, and eventually became a copper mining business. They also developed extensive interests in lumber, property and rail roads. In 1861, he became a partner in the company but left in 1878 to begin a banking business with his father and his father-in-law, Isaac Newton Phelps. The bank named Phelps, Stokes & Company, was disbanded when Stokes's father died in 1881. Stokes was also suffering from an eyesight problem at this time that threatened his vision. Despite this he was appointed temporary administrator of his father estate. The will was contested by James Stokes's daughter, Dora (Stokes) Dale, and her husband Henry and the matter was not settled until 1888. =Real estate= Stokes purchased land in New York and developed the Stokes Building on Cedar Street in collaboration with I. N. Phelps Estates and his sisters. In 1895 he organised the Woodbridge Company, that owned property on William Street, John Street, and Platt Street. Land for Wyllys Building was bought for his son, Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, whose architectural practise, Howells & Stokes, carried out the design. In 1902 Stokes organized the Haynes Company, which owned property on Front Street, Burling Slip and a mansion and estate at New Brighton, Staten Island (Curtis High School now occupies the property) . Another of his property companies was called Dudley and set up to look after property in Liberty Street and William Street. After his death in 1913 these various property companies and others were consolidated by his sons and his long term financial advisor, John W. McCulloch, to form Phelps Stokes Estate, Inc. The names of the companies, Wyllys, Woodbridge, Haynes and Dudley reflected Stokes's interest in family genealogy, as they were all names of his or his wife's ancestors. =Banking= Stokes joined his father-in-law as a director at the Second National Bank and the Mercantile Bank. In 1884 there was a run on the Second National Bank following the misappropriation of funds by the bank's president, John Chester Eno. He had speculated and lost millions of dollars on Wall Street during the panic of that year and was forced to resign, then fled to Canada. The directors, including Issac N Phelps and Anson Stokes, faced the onerous task of making up the losses. However, Eno's father, Amos R. Eno was persuaded by the board to repay the bulk of the loss. The other directors made up shortfalls to ensure the bank survived the run on deposits. =Nevada mining & railroad= Stokes Castle near Austin, Nevada. Whilst at Phelps Dodge Corporation, Stokes had involvement with mining in the American West, and after leaving in 1879, he continued his interests by focusing on the silver mining boom town of Austin, Nevada, a place he had visited in 1863. Most of the mining claims had been consolidated into one company called the Manhattan Silver Mining Co. and they desperately needed a railroad. The secretary of the company, M. J. Farrell, became state senator for Lander County and managed to get a railroad line approved, with a bond of $200,000, due to expire in 1880. The proposal was to run a narrow gauge line ninety three miles along the Reese Valley to connect Austin to the Central Pacific main line at Battle Mountain. It was not until Stokes became involved that the project got started with only months left on the bond. Stokes brought in General James H. Ledlie, a former Union officer in the Civil War, to direct the project, and crews went to work, only to bring the line within of the Austin town limits with less than a day left before the deadline. An emergency meeting of the Austin Town Board extended the town limits by , allowing the last rails to be laid just minutes before the deadline. The line from Battle Mountain to Austin became the Nevada Central Railway.Myrick, David F., Railroads Of Nevada Volume 1, Howell-North Books, 1962 On Feb 25th, 1880 Stokes was appointed a Director of the Nevada Central Railway.Keith Tower in possession of original hand written Certificate of Election & Oath of Office as Director of Nevada Central Railway In 1881 the Union Pacific Railroad purchased the line, but they lost money and in 1885 it was sold at bankruptcy back to the bond holders who included Anson Stokes. In 1888 a new company was formed, now called Nevada Central Railroad. The line continued to struggle and was closed in 1938. Stokes had interests in several companies in Nevada and these were incorporated into the Nevada Company, founded in 1897. His son, James Graham Phelps Stokes, who had recently finished his education at Yale and medical school, became the president. In 1897, when Stokes still had a financial interest in several of the local mines, he built \\"Stokes Castle\\", a three-story stone tower just outside Austin for his son. The building was only occupied for a month, then fell into disrepair. =The Austin Mining Company= In July 1891, Stokes met Mr. P. T. Farnsworth, manager of the Horn Silver Mining Company, and Mr. A. C. Washington, president. They owned mining property in Grantsville, Nevada and had done a large business with the Nevada Central Railroad. They had recently surveyed mines in the Austin area and proposed a partnership with Stokes. The company they formed was the Austin Mining Company, organized to undertake silver-mining at Austin, and other areas. The business was initially profitable but, owing largely to the great decline in silver, became unprofitable. In 1898 Stokes was made aware that Farnsworth was not acting in his best interests. A young lawyer, Tasker Oddie, working for Stokes in New York, had been sent to Nevada to look over his mining operations and discovered embezzlement on a huge scale. The operations were shut down and court cases followed as Stokes attempted to recover the money from Farnsworth and Washington. Stokes continued to mine at Berlin near Ione, Nevada. =Politics= Anson Stokes‚Äôs described his attitude toward politics as follows: :::‚ÄùI have been indisposed to political life, because it is here commonly sordid, interferes with freedom of conscience and of thought and of expression and of action, and often brings unpleasant and immoral associations; and I have felt that I could be more useful working non- politically for civil service reform, free trade, etc., and bringing up my children to be good citizens.‚Äù Despite this, he did campaign in New York for the election of Grover Cleveland and fought against Tammany Hall - the Democratic Party machine that controlled much of New York City. Tammany Hall had been run by William ‚ÄúBoss‚Äù Tweed who had been convicted of corruption and who died in jail in 1872. After his death Tammany was reformed under new leadership, but by the mid 1890s it had returned to its old corrupt ways, first under \\"Honest John\\" Kelly, and then Richard Croker. Several of the wealthy and influential men in the City, including Anson Stokes, came together in 1894/95 to fight Tammany Hall, and formed a ‚ÄúCommittee of Seventy‚Äù. They succeeded by defeating the Tammany mayoral candidate and installing William Lafayette Strong who ran the City on \\"business principles\\". =The Civil Service Reform Association= Stokes was a committee member of the Civil Service Reform Association that included Theodore Roosevelt. The objective of the Association was to establish a system of appointment and promotion in the Civil Service depending upon suitability assessed by competitive examinations, open to all applicants properly qualified, and that removals should be made for legitimate cause only, such as dis-honesty, negligence, or inefficiency, but not for political opinion or refusal to render party service. The Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883 made it law that government positions should be awarded on merit, however the Association continued to push for compliance, improvements, efficiencies and reforms in the U.S Civil Service. =Anti-imperialism= Stokes became chairman of the National Association of Anti-Imperialist Clubs, a movement formed in 1898 to oppose the annexation of Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines at the end of the Spanish‚ÄêAmerican War. He was also an active member and supporter of the free trade league and first president of the New York Reform Club. =Joint Metallism= In 1894 Stoke published his proposals on a monetary system that would be based on the combined use of gold and silver called joint metallism. This came at a period of financial difficulties when there were calls to allow both gold and silver coinage to be used as currency, a system called bimetallism. Stokes's interest in this possibly came from his links to silver mining in Nevada and his support for Grover Cleveland, who was against bimetallism, favouring the gold standard. Stokes‚Äôs book ran to several issues and included a series of letter, quotes and extracts. =Nautical interests= Ultima Globular Naval Battery. Designed by Anson Phelps Stokes. Stokes was a keen yachtsman and was twice elected vice commodore of the New York Yacht Club. The yachts he owned were Nereid, Clytie, Sea Fox and Mermaid. He was also involved with efforts to standardise the rules used in international yacht racing. His interests extended to naval warfare. He designed a warship, referred to as a globular naval battery that was a floating fortress, typically used for harbour defence. The idea came from the story of the British naval use of an island in the Caribbean called Diamond Rock. He published and read a paper on his design called, the Ulitima, in November 1905 before the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers. Personal life 229 Madison Avenue was one of three houses built in 1854. Occupiers Isaac Newton Phelps, John Jay Phelps and William E. Dodge On October 17, 1865, Stokes married Helen Louisa Phelps (1846‚Äì1930). They were related, both being descended from George Phelps (c. 1606‚Äì1687) who came to America in 1630 from England. Together, they were the parents of: 1. Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes (1867‚Äì1944), an architect, who, in 1895, married Edith Minturn (1867‚Äì1937), daughter of shipping magnate, Robert Bowne Minturn, Jr. (1836‚Äì1889); Edith, by way of a sister, Sarah May Minturn (1865‚Äì1919) ‚Äì who was married to Henry Dwight Sedgwick III (1861‚Äì1957) ‚Äì was a great-aunt of actress Edie Sedgwick (n√©e Edith Minturn Sedgwick; 1943‚Äì1971); 2. Sarah Maria Phelps Stokes (1869‚Äì1943), who, in 1890, married Baron Halkett (n√© Hugh Colin Gustave George Halkett III; 1861‚Äì1904) (aka Baron Halkett of London and Frelsdorferm√ºhlen, Hanover; a district next to Frelsdorf); they divorced in England in 1902; she wrote children's books under the pseudonym Aunt Sadie; 3. Helen Olivia Phelps Stokes (1870‚Äì1945), who was an activist and painter; 4. James Graham Phelps Stokes (1872‚Äì1960), a noted socialist, who, in 1905, married Rose Harriet Pastor (n√©e Wieslander; 1879‚Äì1933), a social activist and feminist; 5. Rev. Anson Phelps Stokes Jr. (1874‚Äì1958), an educator and clergyman; 6. Ethel Valentine Phelps Stokes (1876‚Äì1952), married philanthropist John Sherman Hoyt in 1895; 7. Caroline Margaretta Phelps Stokes (1878‚Äì1964), who, in 1903, married Wiles Robert Hunter (1874‚Äì1942), sociologist and author; 8. Mildred Evelyn Phelps Stokes (1881‚Äì1970), who, in 1907, married Ransom Spafard Hooker, M.D. (1873‚Äì1957); 9. Harold Montrose Phelps Stokes (1887‚Äì1970), who wrote for The New York Times as a free-lance author On August 12, 1899, Anson lost one of his legs in a horse-riding accident when he was thrown against a tree and his leg crushed. He had been warned that the horse, a gelding called Dingley, was dangerous but felt confident that he could handle the animal. After the accident a vet cared for the horse, but recommended that the horse be destroyed due to its unpredictable temperament. Anson Phelps Stokes died at 230 Madison Avenue in 1913 Stokes died on June 29, 1913 at 230 Madison Avenue, and was survived by nine children: four sons and five daughters. His personal wealth was estimated at USD $25,000,000 at the time of his death, or about USD$ in today's dollars. However, when his estate was settled, a month after his death, it was reported that the actual value of his estate was between $500,000 and $750,000 (about USD$ in today's dollars. His widow, Helen Louisa (Phelps) Stokes survived him and died in 1930. =Madison Avenue= When he was married in 1865, Stokes and his wife planned to set up home next to Anson Stokes's father, James Stokes, who lived at 37 Madison Avenue. However, Helen's father, Isaac Newton Phelps, expressed a wish that they live near him at 229 Madison Avenue, so James Stokes compromised and purchased 133 Madison Avenue for the young couple ‚Äì midway between the two families. When Helen's mother died in 1867, they moved in with her widowed father at number 229. In 1869, he remarried and Helen and Anson moved out to 230 Madison Avenue (a gift from her father). When Isaac Newton Phelps died in 1888 he left 229 Madison Avenue (plus a million dollars), to his daughter Helen Stokes. The building was extended by architect R. H. Robertson in 1888, adding an attic floor and an extension in East 37th Street that doubled the size of the house. This remained the New York home of the Stokes family until they sold it in 1904 to Mr. J. P. Morgan and moved back into 230 Madison Avenue. The house of James Stokes (37 Madison Avenue) passed to his children and several of them continued to live there until in 1905 it was rebuilt as the Madison Square Apartment House by Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes. 229 Madison Avenue was one of three similar houses built in 1854 in what was, at the time, an unfashionable part of town. One built by Isaac Newton Phelps, on the corner of Thirty-seventh Street, another by John Jay Phelps on the corner of Thirty- sixth Street and in the middle, one built by William E. Dodge, Anson Stokes's uncle. Anson and Helen's first child, Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, was born at 229 Madison Avenue. The house survives and is now number 231 Madison Avenue and part of the Morgan Library & Museum complex. =Shadowbrook= Shadowbrook in 1908 in Lenox, Massachusetts. In 1893, Stokes built Shadowbrook, a 100-room Berkshire Cottage at Lenox, Massachusetts. Shadowbrook was so large that a family anecdote tells of Anson Phelps Stokes Jr. being told by his mother while playing outside one day that because there was a storm gathering he should come inside and bicycle in the attic. Shadowbrook was sold in 1906 to Spencer P. Shotter a wealthy turpentine magnate from Georgia. =Other properties= The Stokes owned a house on Staten Island, purchased in 1868 from John M. Pendleton. Several of their children were born there. They sold in 1886, never to return, because \\"cheap excursion places had caused the ferry-boats to be overcrowded and had brought a rough element to the island.\\" Stokes had built several \\"cottages\\" on the property before they vacated. In 1902, Stokes bought land at the southern tip of Long Neck, a small peninsula in Darien, Connecticut and built Brick House (architects Howell & Stokes), where he and his family lived for many years.Case, Henry J. and Cooper, Simon W., Town of Darien: Founded 1641 Incorporated 1820, published by the Darien Community Association, 1935 (Andrew Carnegie occupied Brick House for several summers, and in 1917 he bought Stokes' estate Shadowbrook, where he died in 1919.) The Stokes family also had a summer house, or Great Camp, on Upper St. Regis Lake in the Adirondacks,Kaiser, Harvey H., Great Camps of the Adirondacks, Boston: David R Godine, 1982. where family members spend their summers to this day. Family =Caroline & Olivia Stokes= Stokes's sister Caroline Phelps Stokes Anson Stokes‚Äôs sisters, Caroline and Olivia, supported the furtherance of deprived groups by giving money to universities and colleges. They also funded orphanages, libraries and affordable housing schemes, often with design help from their architect nephew, Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes. Their work extended to other countries such as Liberia and the Near East. On April 26, 1909 Caroline died at Redlands, California. Anson Stokes and Olivia were executors of the will that required a fund to be set up and used for the erection or improvement of dwellings in New York City for the poor families, for educational of negroes, Native Americans and needy deserving white students, through industrial schools, the foundation of scholarships and the erection or endowment of school buildings or chapels. The Phelps Stokes Fund was to be managed by eleven trustees. Initially Anson Stokes was reluctant to become involved (he was 71 in 1909), and had told his sister this before she died. However, because of the charitable nature of the bequests he agreed to assist with setting up the trust fund. Caroline (Phelps) Stokes family tree published in Stokes Records 1910 =Edward S. Stokes= Anson Stokes' cousin, Edward Stiles Stokes, shot and mortally wounded James Fisk in the Grand Central Hotel on 6 January 1872. The pair had been business associates with Stokes supplying oil from his Brooklyn refinery to Fisk‚Äôs Erie Railway. They both fell for the same woman and this created animosity between the two men, resulting in court cases and a breakdown of their personal and business relationship. Fisk was a popular, rich and well connected but unscrupulous man. He had made a fortune in manipulating Erie Rail Road stock and had strong links to Tammany Hall. Edward S. Stokes was tried three times and eventually found guilty of manslaughter in the third degree, serving four years in jail. Anson Stokes‚Äô father, James, advanced money to Edward, who was the son of his brother, Edward Halesworth Stokes. He also forbade Anson from associating with him but Anson attended most of the sessions of the trial, as he felt it was his duty. =Genealogy= Anson P. Stokes in court dress Stokes took an interest in tracing his family history. He often visited England and used these occasions to locate relatives and the areas where his ancestors had lived. In 1909, he published the first volume of Stokes Records - notes on his ancestry and that of his wife. The final volume was printed in 1915, having been finished by his children. Whilst in England Stokes joined in fox-hunting and grouse shooting, taking country residents or staying with family or acquaintances. He enjoyed the social scene, attending Cowes Week with his cousin Arthur James, on board his yacht Lancashire Witch plus race horse meetings at Goodwood. His wife and daughters, Sarah and Helen, were presented at court in 1889. He attended court of Queen Victoria at St James's Palace during the London seasons, keeping a set of clothes for the occasion - black velvet coat, waistcoat, black silk stockings, shoes with buckles and a sword with a black scabbard.

Mirroring often occurs in social situations, particularly in the company of close friends or family. The concept often affects other individuals' notions about the individual that is exhibiting mirroring behaviors, which can lead to the individual building rapport with others. Mirroring is the subconscious replication of another person's nonverbal signals. This concept takes place in everyday interactions and often goes unnoticed by both the person enacting the mirroring behaviors as well as the individual who is being mirrored. The activation of mirror neurons takes place within the individual who begins to mirror another's movements and allows them a greater connection and understanding with the individual who they are mirroring, as well as allowing the individual who is being mirrored to feel a stronger connection with the other individual. Mirroring is distinct from conscious imitation under the premise that while the latter is a conscious, typically overt effort to copy another person, mirroring is unconsciously done during the act and often goes unnoticed. The display of mirroring often begins as early as infancy, as babies begin to mimic individuals around them and establish connections with particular body movements. The ability to mimic another person's actions allows the infant to establish a sense of empathy and thus begin to understand another person's emotions. The infant continues to establish connections with other individual's emotions and subsequently mirror their movements. Mirroring can establish rapport with the individual who is being mirrored, as the similarities in nonverbal gestures allow the individual to feel more connected with the person exhibiting the mirrored behavior. As the two individuals in the situation display similar nonverbal gestures, they may believe that they share similar attitudes and ideas as well. Mirror neurons react to and cause these movements, allowing the individuals to feel a greater sense of engagement and belonging within the situation. Occurrence Mirroring taking place during a meeting with President Reagan Mirroring generally takes place unconsciously as individuals react with the situation. Mirroring is common in conversation, as the listeners will typically smile or frown along with the speaker, as well as imitate body posture or attitude about the topic. Individuals may be more willing to empathize with and accept people whom they believe hold similar interests and beliefs, and thus mirroring the person with whom one is speaking may establish connections between the individuals involved. =Interviews= Additionally, mirroring may play a role in how well an individual fares in a job interview. Within a study conducted by Word, Zanna and Cooper, interviewers were instructed to follow specific types of body language in different experimental conditions. In one condition, interviewers were instructed to demonstrate distant and uninterested body language (such as leaning away or avoiding eye contact), and in another condition, they were asked to demonstrate more welcoming body language (such as smiling and making eye contact). As a result, the individuals being interviewed began to mirror the actions of the interviewer, and thus the individuals in the condition with less friendly body language fared worse within the interview than did individuals in the friendly condition. The study demonstrates that the initial attitudes that an interviewer may have of the individual being interviewed may affect the performance of the interviewee due to mirroring. =Effects of lacking= Individuals with autism or other social difficulties may be less likely to exhibit mirroring, as they may be less unconsciously and consciously aware of the actions of others. This factor may cause additional difficulties for the individuals, as without mirroring, establishing connections with other people may be more difficult. Additionally, other individuals may be less likely to build rapport with the person, as without mirroring the person may seem more dissimilar and less friendly. Individuals who are not unconsciously aware of the gesture may have difficulties in social situations, as they may be less able to understand another person's perspective without it being explicitly stated, and thus may not understand covert cues that are often used in the social world. It is possible, though very rare, for some of these individuals to deliberately learn and become aware of these cues. This, however, is the exception to the rule, not the norm. =Examinations in humans= The use of noninvasive fMRI studies have shown that there is evidence of mirroring in humans similar to that found in monkeys in the inferior parietal lobe and part of the inferior frontal gyrus. Humans show additional signs of mirroring in parts of the brain not observed to show mirroring properties in primates, such as the cerebellum. Mirroring has also been shown to allow neurotypical children to understand what the intentions of an action are before seeing the entire sequence. Because of this, a child can see someone pick up food with the intention to eat and fire all necessary motor chains needed for them to pick up their own food and go through the motions of eating it as well. It has been shown that children with autism lack this motor chain reaction and are thought to use other senses, such as visual or somatosensory, to accomplish similar tasks. Development A young boy mirrors the gesture of his grandmother In infant- parent interactions, mirroring consists of the parent imitating the infant's expressions while vocalizing the emotion implied by the expression. This imitation helps the infant to associate the emotion with their expression, as well as feel validated in their own emotions as the parent shows approval through imitation. Studies have demonstrated that mirroring is an important part of child and infant development. According to Kohut's theories of self- psychology, individuals need a sense of validation and belonging in order to establish their concepts of self. When parents mirror their infants, the action may help the child develop a greater sense of self-awareness and self- control, as they can see their emotions within their parent's faces. Additionally, infants may learn and experience new emotions, facial expressions, and gestures by mirroring expressions that their parents utilize. The process of mirroring may help infants establish connections of expressions to emotions and thus promote social communication later in life. Infants also learn to feel secure and valid in their own emotions through mirroring, as the parent's imitation of their emotions may help the child recognize their own thoughts and feelings more readily. =Self-concept= Mirroring has been shown to play a critical role in the development of an infant's notion of self. The importance of mirroring suggests that infants primarily gather their social skills from their parents, and thus a household that lacks mirroring may inhibit the child's social development. Without mirroring, it may be difficult for the child to relate their emotions to socially learned expressions and thus have a difficult experience in expressing their own emotions. =Empathy= The inability to properly mirror other individuals may strain the child's social relationships later in life. This strain may exist because others may feel more distant from the child due to a lack of rapport, or because the child may have a difficult time feeling empathy for others without mirroring. Mirroring helps to facilitate empathy, as individuals more readily experience other people's emotions through mimicking posture and gestures. Mirroring also allows individuals to subjectively feel the pain of others when viewing injuries. This empathy may help individuals create lasting relationships and thus excel in social situations. The action of mirroring allows individuals to believe they are more similar to another person, and perceived similarity can be the basis for creating a relationship. As such, mirroring values is also important. Rapport Rapport may be an important part of social life, as establishing rapport with an individual is generally the initial route to becoming friends or acquaintances with another person. Mirroring can help establish rapport, as exhibiting similar actions, attitudes, and speech patterns as another person may lead them to believe that one is more similar to them and thus more likely to be a friend. Individuals may believe that because one replicates the individual's gestures, that one may hold similar beliefs and attitudes as the individual. Mirroring may be more pervasive in close friendships or romantic relationships, as the individuals regard each other highly and thus wish to emulate or appease them. Additionally, individuals who are friends may have more similarities than two strangers, and thus may be more likely to exhibit similar body language regardless of mirroring. =Power dynamics= Additionally, individuals are likely to mirror the person of higher status or power within the situation. Mirroring individuals of higher power may create an illusion of higher status, or create rapport with the individual in power, thus allowing the person to gain favor with the individual in power. This mechanism may be helpful for individuals in situations where they are in a position of bargaining with an individual who possesses more power, as the rapport that mirroring creates may help to persuade the higher status individual to help the person of lower status. These situations include job interviews, other work situations such as requesting promotions, parent-child interactions and asking professors for favors. Each of these situations involves one party who is in a less powerful position for bargaining and another party who has the ability to fulfill the person of lower status's needs but may not necessarily wish to. Thus, mirroring can be a useful tool for individuals of lower status in order to persuade the other party to provide goods or privileges for the lower status party.

His lengthy career and wide variety of aviation experiences were remarkable. Early years Madon was born in Bizerte, Tunisia, and was athletic from an early age. He was short but had exceptional strength and posture. He boxed and played football. Madon first became interested in aviation at the age of 15, when he made an unsuccessful attempt to build his own craft. He had quit school to get over an attack of malaria. After building models and kites, he fabricated his own bicycle- powered \\"aviette\\". His desire to fly led him to attempt to become a pilot for the Ottoman Empire. When that failed, he enlisted in the First Engineering Regiment in Versailles, and ended up as a cook. He repeatedly requested pilot's training. Aerial service He ultimately qualified as a pilot in June 1911, after 19 lessons. On 12 March 1912, he enlisted in the French military and received his military pilot's license at Avord, France, in January 1913. Although only a corporal, he was one of France's most experienced military pilots. He originally flew reconnaissance and night-time bombing missions while assigned to fly prewar Bleriots with Escadrille (squadron) BL30. The night flying missions were some of the first ever, and his experience probably accounted for this assignment. Certainly it saved his life, when on 30 October 1914, his engine was destroyed by a direct hit from 77 mm cannon fire. It took exceptional skill to coax the Bleriot to a dead stick landing against the wind within French lines. In April 1915, thrown off course by heavy fog, Madon flew into Swiss air space while qualifying upon a new Farman, and was interned for several months. It took him two tries to escape, but he freed himself in December by chloroforming and kidnapping his guard. His reward was a court-martial and 60 days confinement. He was then posted to Escadrille MF218 as a sergeant directing artillery fire. He requested transfer to a fighter squadron. After retraining at Pau and Cazaux, he was posted to fly Nieuports with N38 on 1 September 1916.VII Aces of World War I By Jon Guttman He scored his first victory on the 28th. By the year's end, he was up to four and had been promoted to adjutant. Madon began the new year by strafing an enemy locomotive to a halt. Later, on 2 July 1917, he was wounded in action when he collided with an enemy aircraft and crashed. By then, he had 12 victories. The following month, he was commissioned a sous lieutenant. By October, his confirmed score was 17, with 20 unconfirmed. He was said to have returned with blood and brains on his plane's propeller three times; another time, he brought home the glasses from an enemy observer's face stuck in his plane's wire bracing. By March 1918, his personal score stood at 25 confirmed. He was appointed to command Escadrille Spa38, which was re- equipped with new Spad XIIIs. Although principally a photo reconnaissance unit, Spa38 aggressively defended itself. They lived up to the motto they adopted from their commander: \\"Whoever rubs against me gets pricked\\". They also adopted his black thistle insignia on their planes. Madon leaning against a Spad As part of Madon's new role, he mentored other pilots who became aces because of his tutelage; among these were Andre Martenot de Cordou, Hector Garaud, and American David Putnam. By war's end, he was credited with 41 confirmed victories and 64 probables. About the latter, he once nonchalantly remarked: \\"The Boche knows his losses.\\" His score of 41 still ranked him fourth among all French pilots. In an ironic twist, he was promoted to temporary captain on the last day of the war, Armistice Day, 1918. In an era when fighter aces' careers were commonly measured in months, he had had a two- year string of victories. With seven years of flying experience, he was one of the world's most experienced aviators by the war's end. Later years Madon stayed in aviation after the war ended. In 1922, he flew a radically designed racing monoplane scheduled for the Coupe-Deutsch Race. The Simplex monoplane had a Hispano-Suiza engine crammed into a short fuselage; pilot view was seriously limited by a rearward seating behind a barrel radiator. Madon crashed the plane during a test flight and suffered severe injuries. Precisely six years after Armistice Day, at age 32, Madon was killed in his native Tunisia preparing for a tribute to fellow airman Roland Garros. His aircraft suffered mechanical trouble, and he gallantly crashed it into the roof of a villa rather than hit spectators. He died in Tunis. Legacy Madon's legacy is founded on more than his experienced long service to his country and his long rise through military ranks. His score sheet included an incredible 64 probable victories. Confirmation of any sizable number of these might raise him to a score even greater than that of Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron himself. Madon was awarded three medals by his own country: M√©daille Militaire, Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur, and Croix de Guerre with ten palms. He also was awarded the Italian Order for Valor, and the Romanian Order for Valor. The Avord Air Base, where he learned to fly, is named \\"Base A√©rienne 702 Capitaine Georges Madon\\".

Taking its name from medieval troubadours, the Troubadour Style () is a rather derisive term,Havard, Henri, La Hollande pittoresque , Vol. 2 of Les fronti√®res menac√©es: Voyage dans les provinces de Frise, Groningue, Drenthe, Overyssel, Gueldre et Limbourg, 1876, Plon, google books in English usually applied to French historical painting of the early 19th century with idealised depictions of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. In French it also refers to the equivalent architectural styles. It can be seen as an aspect of Romanticism and a reaction against Neoclassicism, which was coming to an end at the end of the Consulate, and became particularly associated with Josephine Bonaparte and Caroline Ferdinande Louise, duchesse de Berry. In architecture the style was an exuberant French equivalent to the Gothic Revival of the Germanic and Anglophone countries. The style related to contemporary developments in French literature, and music, but the term is usually restricted to painting and architecture.Palmer History Richard Parkes Bonington, Henri III of France The rediscovery of medieval civilization was one of the intellectual curiosities of the beginning of the 19th century, with much input from the Ancien R√©gime and its institutions, rites (the coronation ceremony dated back to the 16th century) and the medieval churches in which family ceremonies occurred. Even while exhuming the remains of the kings and putting on the market a multitude of objects, works of art and elements of medieval architecture, the revolutionaries brought them back to life, it could be said. The Mus√©e des monuments fran√ßais (Museum of French Monuments), established in the former convent that would become Paris's √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts, presented all this glorious debris of the Middle Ages as subjects of admiration for the public and as models of inspiration for students of the departments of engraving, painting and sculpture, but not those of architecture since teaching of this subject had been dissociated from the \\"beaux-arts\\" and placed in the √âcole centrale des travaux publics under the direction of J.N.L Durand, a harsh promoter of the neoclassical architecture that characterized the styles of the Convention and Consulate. Later, from the Bourbon Restoration and under the impulse of Quatrem√®re de Quincy and M√©rim√©e, a new tradition of teaching architecture put it back under the fine arts umbrella, in the margins of the declining official school, beginning with private workshops that behaved as diocesan architects working for historic monuments that would give rise to the Soci√©t√© Centrale des Architectes and make Troubador-style architecture possible. Jean-Baptiste Goyet, H√©lo√Øse et Abailard, oil on copper, 1829.The resurgence of Christian feeling and in Christianity in the arts, with the publication in 1800 of Le G√©nie du Christianisme ('the Genius of Christianity'), played a major role in favour of edifying painting, sculpture and literature, often inspired by religion. Artists and writers rejected the neo-antique rationalism of the French Revolution and turned towards a perceived glorious Christian past. The progress of the history and archaeology in the course of the 18th century began to bear fruit, at first, in painting. Paradoxically these painters of the past were unaware of the primitives of French painting, finding it too academic and not sufficiently filled with anecdote. Napoleon himself did not disdain this artistic current: he took as his emblem the golden beehive on the grave of the Merovingian king Childeric I, rediscovered in the 17th century, and saw himself as the heir of the French monarchy. He also gave official recognition to the Middle Ages in the forms of his coronation, and tried to profit from other trappings of the medieval French kings, perhaps even their miraculous curative powers (Bonaparte visiting the plague-victims of Jaffa by Antoine-Jean Gros was read as a modern re-envisgaing of the thaumaturgical kings). Literature Public interest in the Middle Ages in literature first manifested itself in France and above all England. In France, this came with the adaptation and publication from 1778 of ancient chivalric romances by the Comte de Tressan (1707‚Äì1783) in his Biblioth√®que des romans,Palmer and in England with the first fantastical romances, like The Castle of Otranto. These English romances inspired late 18th century French writers to follow suit, such as Donation de Sade with his Histoire secrete d'Isabelle de Baviere, reine de France. The Le Troubadour, po√©sies occitaniques (1803) by Fabre d'Olivet popularized the term, and may have led to the naming of the style in art. The Waverley Novels of Walter Scott were hugely popular across Europe, and a major influence on both painting and French novelists such as Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo. Painting Pharamond lifted on a shield by the Franks, by Pierre-Henri R√©voil and Michel Philibert Genod, 1845 In painting, the troubadour style was represented by history painting portraying edifying historical episodes, often borrowing its smoothness, its minute and illusionistic description of detail, its rendering of fabrics, the intimate character of its familiar scenes and its other technical means from Dutch Golden Age painting. The paintings were typically rather small cabinet paintings, often showing quiet intimate anecdotal moments rather than moments of high drama, though these were both depicted.Palmer As well as figures from political history, famous artists and authors of the past were often shown, especially Raphael and Dante. Ingres' Death of Leonardo da Vinci in the arms of King Francois I of France is one of several works bringing rulers and artists together. A number of paintings by Ingres are in the style, and lesser artists such as Pierre-Henri R√©voil (1776‚Äì1842) and Fleury-Fran√ßois Richard (1777‚Äì1852) specialized in the style. The Belgian Henri Leys painted in a more sombre version of the style much influenced by Northern Renaissance painting. Richard Parkes Bonington is better remembered for his landscapes, but also painted in the style, as did Eug√®ne Delacroix. The peak period was brought to an end by the Revolution of 1848, and later the arrival of Realism, although the style arguably merged into late 19th century academic painting. The transition can be seen in the work of Paul Delaroche. Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband Louis of Orl√©ans by Fran√ßois Fleury- Richard (c. 1802) Hermitage Museum, Saint-Petersburg Arguably the first troubadour painting was presented at the Salon of 1802, under the French Consulate. It was a work by Fleury-Richard, Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband,Palmer a subject which had come to the artist during a visit to the \\"mus√©e des monuments fran√ßais\\", a museum of French medieval monuments. A tomb from this museum was included in the painting as that of the wife. Thanks to its moving subject matter, the painting was an enormous success ‚Äì seeing it, David cried \\"This resembles nothing anyone else has done, it's a new effect of colour; the figure is charming and full of expression, and this green curtain thrown across this window renders the illusion complete\\". Compositions lit from the back of the scene, with the foreground in semi-darkness, became rather a trademark of the early years of the style. Fragonard's painting of Fran√ßois Premier re√ßu chevalier par Bayard (Francis I knighted by Bayard, Salon of 1819) has to be read not as a rediscovery of a medieval past, but as a memory of a recent monarchic tradition. =Examples= * Pierre-Nolasque Bergeret, Aretino in the studio of Tintoretto, Salon of 1822. * Madame Cheradame, n√©e Bertaud, The Education of Saint Louis. * Michel Martin Dr√∂lling, The Last Communion of Marie-Antoinette, Paris, Conciergerie. * Louis Ducis, Le Tasse reading a passage from his poem Jerusalem Delivered to Princess √âl√©onore d‚ÄôEste, formerly in the collection of the Empress Jos√©phine.

It can be seen as overly sentimental or unrealistically nostalgic, treating its subjects in a way \\"later associated with Hollywood costume dramas. To its proponents, the archaic details were regarded as a rallying cry for a new, localized nationalism, purged of classical (or neo- classical) and Roman influence. The small size of many of the canvases was considered a reference to Northern, primitive painting, devoid of Italian influence. To others, the small canvas sizes represent the artworks' insignificance and lack of vigor. All the brass, gilding, carving and inlaid historical detail of the headboards of the world could not redeem such objects as anything other than interior decoration. Architecture Calvados, 1864 A fashion for medieval architecture may be seen throughout 19th century Europe, originating in England, and a blooming of the Neogothic style, but in France this remains limited to certain 'feudal' buildings in the parks surrounding ch√¢teaux.

It is approximately north-west of St Andrews, and is situated on the estuary of the River Eden, at the junction of the A91 road between St Andrews and Stirling and the A919/A914 road between Leuchars and the Tay Road Bridge. Guardbridge has a number of local amenities including a school, general store, garages, hotel, takeaway food shop, hairdresser, furniture maker, and bowling and fishing clubs. The village has also become a very popular dormitory settlement due to its close proximity to St Andrews and Dundee.  History  The village takes its name from the 15th-century six-arched bridge built by Bishop Henry Wardlaw,Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland (New Edition, Vol III who founded the University of St Andrews. Some have said the bridge was built to assist pilgrims en route to St Andrews; however, its purpose was to provide safe access for students to ensure the success of Wardlaw's university. Though the first element of the name is anglicized as 'Guard', the origin of the name has never been satisfactorily explained. As alternatives are less credible, the theory that this may come from \\"gare\\", the French term for statio, an assembly point for pilgrims, retains some credence in academic sources. Others cast doubt on such usage of \\"gare\\" before the 18th century. Alternative theories include the Scots words \\"gair\\", meaning muddy, or, though unlikely, \\"gerr\\", meaning clumsy or awkward. The bridge is a Category A listed building. St Andrews was one of the most important pilgrimage centres in Europe. Hostels were available every 6 miles along the pilgrim trail, with the last one located at Guardbridge. There, up to 600 pilgrims were provided with dormitories, a refectory and a church. From that point, the Augustinians regulated the numbers travelling into the holy city of St Andrews. The average stay in the town was three months. In 1852, the north-east Fife railway line was extended to St Andrews and a viaduct was built over the Eden. This St Andrews Railway was closed in 1969, not as part of the Beeching cuts, as is commonly supposed, but by British Rail. The viaduct was demolished, but its supporting piers are still visible in the river. In 1873 William Haig and two of his sons formed the Guardbridge Paper Company. This was to find a more profitable use for their Seggie whisky distillery, which had been established there since 1810. The mill went into production in 1874. As the mill developed, the village grew around it, with new housing and roads to attract and accommodate workers. Before the First World War the labour force was over 400 and reached a peak of 620 in the late 1950s. The paper mill was previously the main local industry and was operated by Curtis Fine Papers. On July 24, 2008, the mill went into receivership and 180 workers were made redundant. Many locals were employed elsewhere in Fife, Dundee, Edinburgh or even further afield. The building which housed the mill is now Eden Brewery.

Tea tasting is the process in which a trained taster determines the quality of a particular tea. Due to climatic conditions, topography, manufacturing process, and different clones of the Camellia sinensis plant (tea), the final product may have vastly differing flavours and appearance. These differences can be tasted by a trained taster in order to ascertain the quality prior to sale or possibly blending tea. Techniques The ISO 3103 standard describes a standardised method for brewing teas in order to make meaningful sensory comparisons between them. It is not a particularly useful standard for many teas, however, requiring a six-minute brewing time and boiling water, neither of which are recommended for green teas (usually brewed at < 90 ¬∞C and for under 3 minutes). Tea tasters would instead usually taste teas which have been brewed according to the recommendations of the producer. A tea taster uses a large spoon and noisily slurps the liquid into his/her mouth - this ensures that both the tea and plenty of oxygen is passed over all the taste receptors on the tongue to give an even taste profile of the tea. The liquid is then usually spat back out into a spittoon before moving onto the next sample to taste. The flavour characteristics and indeed leaf colour, size and shape are graded using a specific language created by the tea industry to explain the overall quality. Generally speaking, once the quality has been tasted/graded, each tea company places a value on it based on market trends, availability and demand. Professional tea-taster George F.

The castle and 250 acre estate are privately owned. Pronunciation of Castell Gwrych (Welsh) Pronunciation of Gwrych Castle (English) Early history The Lloyds (Llwyds) of Plas yn y Gwrych were the ancestral owners of Gwrych and could trace their ancestry back to the medieval period. They were part of the royal house of Marchudd ap Cynan, founder of the VIII Noble Tribe of North Wales. The Lloyds also shared co-sanguinity with Llywelyn the Great.https://www.gwrychcastle.co.uk/history/ Situated within the Gwrych Castle Estate are a pair of iron hillforts, a Roman shrine, lead/silver mines and medieval battle sites; the latterhttps://snowdonia.info/gwrych-castle/ are recorded on stone tablets at the principal entrance.https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/300000232-tan-yr-ogof-lodge- including-adjoining-walls-and-towers-to-s-e-and-w-llanddulas-and-rhyd-y-foel The creation of the castle Gwrych Castle was built between 1810 and 1825 by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh (1787-1861), in memory of his mother Frances Lloyd and her ancestors. It incorporated an earlier house that had been in the ownership of the Lloyds since the late-medieval period.https://www.countrylife.co.uk/architecture/gwrych-castle-217018/ From 1894 until 1924, Winifred Cochrane, Countess of Dundonald, the Hesketh heiress, owned the estate and it became the residence of the Dundonald family (family name of Cochrane). The Countess left the castle in her will to King George V and the then Prince of Wales (who later became King Edward VIII). However, the gift was refused and the castle passed to the Venerable Order of Saint John. In 1928, Douglas Cochrane, 12th Earl of Dundonald purchased the castle for ¬£78,000 (calculated at ~¬£4,288,000 in 2019 after inflation), selling the contents to meet the cost. {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\" A page of Anne Wagner's scrapbook devoted to Mrs Browne of Gwrych depicting the original medieval building, Plas yn y Gwrych, prior to the erection of the castle, c.1800 Gwrych Castle in 1825, shortly after the Georgian castellated mansion had been completed Gwrych Castle in the 1920s, viewed from the Hesketh Tower } During World War II, as part of the Kindertransport programme, the Government used the castle to house 200 Jewish refugees run by the Jewish Zionist youth movement Bnei Akiva. Following the war, the castle and estate left the Dundonald family and was opened to the public as a visitor attraction. The Headless Monster According to a few articles from 1913, the main road leading to Colwyn Bay past Gwrych Castle, a person claimed that he saw a headless creature in a field over a hedge and another person claimed they heard a screech on the same road, but the headless creature turned out to be a black and white sheep that looked headless due to its black head blending with the shadows of the hedges and the screech turned out to be a broken branch of a tree being blown by the wind, but this heightened fear caused many people to avoid that road completely, walking miles longer or take a train instead, men also took up arms purchasing revolvers to protect themselves on their way to work.Temuka Leader, Issue 7333, 14 June 1913, Page 6 Visitor attraction Gwrych Castle became known as \\"The Showpiece of Wales\\" and attracted many visitors. It was also used as a training venue for the English World Middleweight boxing champion Randolph Turpin in the early 1950s. The restored formal gardens at Gwrych Castle. Built in the 1830s they were based on Queen Eleanor's garden at Conwy CastleIn the early 1960s it was an occasional venue for the famous motorcycle Dragon Rally and in the 1970s it was used as a centre for medieval re-enactments, attracting tourists with such events as jousting and banquets.http://www.countrylife.co.uk/architecture/gwrych-castle-217018/amp Closure and decline Between 1982 and 1986 the location attracted scooterists from all across Britain, there are a few accounts of scooterists exhibiting their bikes and scooters, although many of those who attended were peaceful, there were a few who were antisocial, there were many young people who were denied service from the Castle bar because of their age, but because there were very little staff hired, when they turned their backs, they would then return to steal kegs from the bar and carry them outside where many would help themselves, it was also common occurrence for youths to swing from the chandeliers and jump on and break large antique tables, on another occasion someone rode their Lambretta scooter through one of the stained-glass windows, there was another occurrence of portaloos being set alight, the police attended the area regularly to keep the peace. The castle closed to the public in 1987, and it started to decline.https://www.gwrychcastle.co.uk/history/ It was bought in 1989 by Nick Tavaglione, an American businessman, for ¬£750,000.https://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/12m-bid-castle-its- not-2892567 However, his plans to renovate the building were not carried out. As a result, the castle was extensively looted and vandalised, becoming little more than a derelict shell, although it was used in 1996 as the backdrop for Prince Valiant, a film starring Edward Fox, Joanna Lumley and Katherine Heigl. It is currently open for guided and self-guided tours but part of the site is closed as unsafe.https://www.gwrychcastle.co.uk/visit/ During the period of Tavaglione's ownership, historian Mark Baker campaigned for the castle to be brought back to its days of glory‚Äîa campaign that he started when he was twelve years old. Baker was instrumental in forming the Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, dedicated to ensuring the castle's future. The condition of the property was monitored by the Trust, who lobbied Conwy council to compulsorily purchase the property, eventually placing pressure on the American owner, who put it up for sale in March 2006.Gwrych Castle and estateCity Services Ltd, trading as Clayton Homes and Clayton Hotels, bought the castle in January 2007 for ¬£850,000, after it failed to reach its ¬£1.5m reserve price at the 2 June 2006 auction. On 30 April 2007, Clayton Hotels announced a three-year project, costing ¬£6,000,000, to renovate the castle and convert it into a 90-bedroom 5-star hotel, creating 100 jobs. The project was subject to planning permission, but had the support of the Trust. Clayton Hotels spent about ¬£500,000 on its plans, clearing the site and rebuilding areas.Future of Abergele‚Äôs Gwrych Castle remains uncertain by Rob Davies, Daily Post, 12 April 2010. After Clayton Hotels was placed in administration, new developers obtained fresh planning permission in November 2012 from Conwy County Borough Council for the castle to be converted into a luxury hotel with 75 bedrooms and associated facilities. Rescue of the castle and estate On 13 June 2018, Gwrych Castle and its estate was sold to Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, a registered charity, enabled by a grant from the National Heritage Memorial Fund. Due to the large cost of repairs and restoring lost content, the trust relies on volunteers or/and philanthropists who are able to contribute their time, experiences, knowledge and skills. Work on the castle to prepare for I'm a Celebrity filming In August 2020 it was rumoured that ITV had chosen the castle, for filming of the 20th series of I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! after the COVID-19 pandemic meant that the usual Australia location was no longer usable.

Bauhaus was originally derived from the older Rigi reverse engineering environment,Holger Kienle and Xiaomin Wu REPORT FOR THE SORTIE STRUCTURED TOOL DEMONSTRATION. Technical report, University of Victoria, 2001. which was expanded by Bauhaus due to the Rigi's limitations.

It was nominated for the 2006 Man Booker Prize and the Guardian First Book Award. It has so far been translated into 22 languages and was awarded the 2007 Royal Society of Literature Ondaatje Prize as well as a host of international literary prizes. The book was also nominated for the 2007 National Book Critics Circle Award in the U.S and won the Arab American Book Award in 2007. Plot Summary The book follows the plight of Suleiman, a nine-year-old boy living in Tripoli in Libya, stuck between a father whose clandestine anti-Qaddafi activities bring about searches, stalkings and telephone eaves droppings by Qaddafi's state police, and a vulnerable young mother who resorts to alcohol to bury her anxiety and anger. The only people he has to turn to are his neighbor Kareem, and his father's best friend Moosa. The book provides a description of Libya under Qaddafi's terror regime, and a narration of ordinary people's lives as they try to survive the political oppression. Suleiman grows up partially wealthy because his father, Faraj, is involved in the exotic trade business. Since Faraj's job involves traveling overseas for long periods of time, Suleiman's childhood has primarily been reared by his mother, Najwa. As a youth, Najwa was oppressed by her family, and she desired her independence through education instead of forcefully getting marriage. She made a plan to swallow multiple birth control pills in order to deter a future husband. However, she miraculously still got pregnant with Suleiman and was nonetheless forced to abandon her dream for education and raise Suleiman. She disparages the stories of One Thousand and One Nights, claiming that Scheherazade still had to ask permission from Shahryar. Her cynical view of the world instills a sense of confusion and a weary eye towards authority. Ustath Rashid, a university professor, moves next door to Suleiman's family and they become friends. Rashid and his son, Kareem, take Suleiman on a trip to Lepits Magna in order to engage with the past history of Libya. Two days after the trip, Ustath Rashid is kidnapped by members of Qaddafi's Revolutionary Committee. Suleiman watches Kareem stand perplexed and confused, suddenly rumored to be a \\"traitor\\". A week later, Suleiman sees his father being followed by his office clerk, Nasser, at the Martyr's Square, and suspects him of being involved in something other than exotic trade. His suspicions prove true as the Revolutionary Committee comes his home and interrogate the family. Najwa and Moosa, Faraj's best friend and the son of a wealthy lawyer from Egypt, hangs a picture of Qaddafi in their living room. They burn all of Faraj's books and letters. Suleiman is saddened and angered by watching his father's work being destroyed, and he keeps a book titled Democracy Now, a gift from Ustath Rashid. Within the political, social, and familial confusion, Suleiman is forced to define his own independence and grows up awkwardly. He fights with Kareem as they play a game of \\"Your Land, My Land\\" because he called his father a traitor, he envies Adnan because he felt diabetes gives a person independence, and after offering the village beggar Bahloul food, he gets into a fight with him. His mother's psychology deteriorates throughout the confusion and becomes more reliant in consuming alcohol, but after she reveals to Suleiman a history of familial abuse, he imagines his mother happy, and realizes that the ability to imagine her happy means happiness is still attainable. After making allegiance with their neighbor, Abu Jafer, Suleiman and his family watch a national broadcast to show the strength of Qaddafi's revolution. To deliver a symbolic message, the government hangs Ustath Rashid, demonstrating that no one is capable to stand against the revolution. Faraj returns after the hanging, is badly beaten, and Suleiman has fear for his father. In a moment of irony, Suleiman found himself longing for the connection the family had while watching the hanging of Ustath Rashid. Suleiman is eventually forced to leave Tripoli and travel to Cairo. He objected the decision but was nonetheless sent. After fifteen years in Cairo, Suleiman grows to be a pharmacist, believing that he did so because of his mother's addiction to her own medications. After his father's passing, Najwa decides to travel to Cairo to see his son. Once they reunite, she adores as if they were never separated, and he realizes that despite all the political confusion and madness, they were still able to live.

It first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 7, 2007 and was rated TV-MA-L. In the episode, Randy uses the racial slur \\"niggers\\" on Wheel of Fortune, leading to widespread public outrage. Stan attempts to understand the epithet's impact on his black friend Token. Meanwhile, a dwarf has a hard time trying to teach Cartman to be sensitive. Parker and Stone had long wanted to create an episode exploring the racial slur, but struggled with a plot line beyond its opening scene. They subsequently found it easier to work on following comedian Michael Richards' controversy, in which he screamed the slur at black audience members who had heckled him during his comedy act. Despite the frequent usage of the racial slur, the episode attracted very little media attention. Parents Television Council founder L. Brent Bozell criticized the lack of protest against the episode. The group Abolish the \\"N\\" Word, which is linked with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, praised the episode, calling it a good example of the word's impact on individuals. The episode was critically acclaimed by contemporary television critics, who praised the episode's humor and storyline. According to Nielsen Media Research, the episode was seen by 2.8 million viewers the week it was broadcast. \\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\\" was released on DVD along with the rest of the eleventh season on August 12, 2008.  Plot  Randy is on Wheel of Fortune, and has made it to the bonus round for a chance to win $30,000. The episode is airing live, with his family watching him from the audience and the South Park residents watching from home. He has to solve a puzzle in the category \\"People Who Annoy You\\", and is given the letters R, T, S, L, and E. Randy adds the letters B, N, G, and O, after which the puzzle spells \\"N_GGERS\\". Randy, hesitant to say the answer due to its pejorative nature, is given 10 seconds to solve the puzzle. But when host Pat Sajak tells Randy that he has five seconds left, he reluctantly yells out \\"niggers!\\" by accident, which shocks fans, as well as his family and friends, and angers African-American members of the audience. The correct answer is then revealed to be \\"naggers\\". On the car ride back home, Sharon is very disgusted with Randy for using the racial slur on live television. Stan goes to school the next day, knowing his father had just said the N-word over live television. Cartman confronts him, saying that Token will be mad at him for his actions. He goes to Token to try and explain, saying his father isn't racist but is just stupid. Cartman, seeing an opportunity to cause conflict, tries to get the two into a \\"Race War\\". Token, instead of fighting, walks away. Cartman sees this as a forfeit, and also runs away screaming \\"Whites Win!\\" Seeking forgiveness, Randy visits Jesse Jackson to apologize. Jackson bends over his desk and tells Randy to apologize by kissing his buttocks. Randy does so and a picture is taken, which is then put into the news. Stan seeks out Token, expecting everything to be better now since his dad apologized, yet Token is still mad, saying, \\"Jesse Jackson is not the emperor of black people!\\" To which Stan replies, \\"He told my dad he was.\\" The school, in light of the recent events, hires a smart man and author with dwarfism named Dr. David Nelson who goes from school to school to talk to students about sensitivity, telling them that words are harmless. As soon as Dr. Nelson walks on stage, Cartman laughs hysterically. At first, Dr. Nelson believes that he would tire himself out but realizes that he has no chance to talk, even after Mr. Mackey walks on stage ordering Cartman to be quiet. Randy then goes to a comedy club, but he is singled out by the black comedian resembling Chris Rock, who calls Randy the \\"Nigger-Guy.\\" Thereafter, everyone in town uses the name against Randy, making him feel like an outcast. Back at school, Dr. Nelson talks to Principal Victoria and Mr. Mackey about Cartman and asks them to have him meet with him. When Cartman comes in though, all he can do is laugh and make fun of him. Dr. Nelson keeps on saying that Eric's words don't hurt him, but as Cartman keeps on laughing, Dr. Nelson loses his temper and yells at him saying, \\"Shut your fucking mouth,\\" which shocks both Mackey and Victoria, in contrast to their prior indifference over Cartman's treatment of Dr. Nelson. Stan once again confronts Token, but this time to say he understands how Token feels about the N-word after how he saw Cartman laugh at Dr. Nelson. Still mad, Token says that he does not really think Stan understands. After this, Dr. Nelson calls all of the students to the Gymnasium to teach Cartman a lesson by making fun of his weight problem with the words \\"Hello Fatso!\\" when he walks in so he understands how it feels. They do this, and Cartman responds angrily, but when Dr. Nelson comes out to scold him again, he breaks up in laughter again. Meanwhile, in further attempts to clear his name, Randy opens up the Randy Marsh African American Scholarship Foundation. When walking away from the grand opening, he is chased by a trio of socially progressive rednecks carrying shotguns, who are angry at him for slandering an entire race of people. However, other \\"Nigger-Guys,\\" led by Michael Richards from Seinfeld and including Mark Fuhrman, rescue him and scare the rednecks off. Michael Richards introduces Randy to other Nigger-Guys and accepts him into their ranks. Stan gets fed up with Token, and demands to know why he's still angry. The two are interrupted by Butters who tells them Cartman is going to fight Dr. Nelson in the town's park, and the three run off to go see. Before the fight, Kyle warns Cartman that Dr. Nelson is a karate black belt. After Dr. Nelson announces to beat Cartman to prove his point, which is words shouldn't hurt him, the two begin to wrestle wherein Cartman easily gets the upper hand. Later in Washington D.C., the \\"Nigger-Guys\\" are pleading their case to the Senate to ban the word \\"Nigger-Guy.\\" The Motion is passed by the Senate and as a result, anyone saying the words \\"nigger\\" and \\"guy\\" within seven words of each other would be prosecuted and fined. Back in the park, Dr. Nelson gives up after being pinned by Cartman, who forces him to submit by saying \\"Uncle\\" and \\"Carol Anne, don't go into the light\\". As Cartman gloats about his victory, Dr. Nelson rises and kicks Cartman to the ground. However, Cartman remains unfazed and continues to laugh. An angered Dr. Nelson storms off, saying he 'proved' his point, which all the students have forgotten. It is then that Stan understands that he doesn't get it. He tells Token that he will never understand how it feels to have the N-word against him because he isn't black, which was what Token was looking to hear all along and they reconcile. Production \\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\\" was the season premiere of South Park eleventh season, and the first episode of the show's spring 2007 run, which consists of seven episodes. Parker and Stone had wanted to create an episode centered on the racial slur \\"nigger\\" for a considerable time. The first scene, in which Randy uses the word on Wheel of Fortune, was the first idea for the episode and remained the only idea for a while; Parker called the scene \\"one of my favorite things we‚Äôve ever done.\\" Shortly beforehand, comedian Michael Richards encountered massive controversy due to a performance at the Laugh Factory in November 2006, in which he screamed the ‚ÄúN‚Äù word repeatedly at a group of African-Americans who heckled him. Parker and Stone decided it would be best, considering the media coverage of the incident, to work on the episode then. In the episode's DVD commentary, they noted that it was clear from the video of Richards that he had significant problems, but that they really felt contempt for him when he apologized to civil rights leader Jesse Jackson. Staff writer Vernon Chatman, who is half-black, was particularly outraged by this, noting that Jackson \\"is not the ambassador of black people‚Äù, which inspired the line in the episode where Token says that Jackson \\"is not the emperor of black people\\". Stan responds by saying \\"he told my dad he was\\". Stone particularly enjoyed the ending of the episode, remarking, \\"If there was a word as hateful as the n-word [in how it] applies to black people, if there was a word like that against white people, [they] would make it illegal.\\" They created the idea of using the epithet to apply to whites only, which was when the rest of the episode began to germinate. While they felt the Randy A story was excellent, they wanted to have a B story involving the boys. They came up with the idea of Stan and Token arguing about his father's use of the word, which remained the only subplot idea. They continued to struggle with the subplot until roughly three days prior to air, when they created the idea of Cartman encountering a little person. They based the little person on an obscure old commercial featuring little people walking around in suits.

Parents Television Council founder L. Brent Bozell claimed that there was a lack of protest against this episode compared to radio host Don Imus's comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team, even challenging Flowers' comments that the episode's use of nigger was not intended to be racist, but in fact the theme of the episode was to argue against those who support civility.L.

He married the primary school teacher and author Kara Huber in 1966 and they have three children and two grandchildren. His father was Ernst Rudolf Huber, a well-known lawyer and German constitutional scholar. Huber‚Äôs mother was the attorney Tula Huber-Simons. Huber studied Protestant theology from 1960 to 1966 at the University of Heidelberg, University of G√∂ttingen and at the University of T√ºbingen where he received his doctorate in 1966. He finished his Habilitation at the University of Heidelberg in 1972. After working in the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg from 1966 to 1968 Huber was appointed as researcher and later director of the Protestant Institute for Interdisciplinary Research in Heidelberg from 1968 until 1980. He served as member of a number of church organizations and committees: From 1973 to 1984 as member of the EKD‚Äôs Chamber for Public Responsibility, from 1975 to 1980 as member of the Evangelical Church of the Union‚Äôs Board, from 1980 to 1994 as member of the Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag‚Äôs executive committee from 1983 to 1985 as its president. He was appointed as Professor of Social Ethics at the University of Marburg in 1980, and Professor of Systematic Theology (with a focus on ethics) at the University of Heidelberg in 1984. In 1989 he was also Lilly Visiting Professor at Emory University. In 1993 he was chosen as Bishop of the Evangelical Church of Berlin-Brandenburg- Silesian Upper Lusatia, in 1997 as member of the Council of the EKD and in 2003 as Chairperson of the Council. From 1998 to 2001 Huber served as member of the Central and Executive Committees of the World Council of Churches. Huber retired in November 2009. Markus Dr√∂ge succeeded him as Bishop and Margot K√§√ümann succeeded him as Chairperson of the EKD‚Äôs Council. Since retiring Huber has resumed many of his honorary and voluntary positions, amongst others his position as Chairperson of the Stiftung Garnisonkirche Potsdam and Dean of the Domstift Brandenburg. He continues to be engaged in public ethical debates and was chosen by the German Cabinet to serve on Germany‚Äôs Ethics Council in 2010. His research on ethics currently concerns the mediation of values in business and society. Since choosing the position of Bishop of Berlin-Brandenburg above a seat in the German Bundestag for the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1993 Huber has not associated himself with any political party publicly. His was consequently considered as potential neutral candidate to replace the then President of Germany Horst K√∂hler after his resignation in 2010. Thought Huber has worked on a wide variety and great number of ethical and theological themes. With his father Huber edited five volumes of documents on German church-state relations.Staat und Kirche im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert, 1973-1995 His other publications include Kirche und √ñffentlichkeit (1973), Menschenrechte. Perspektiven einer menschlichen Welt (1977, with Heinz Eduard T√∂dt), Kirche (1979), Folgen christlicher Freiheit. Ethik und Theorie der Kirche im Horizont der Barmer Theologischen Erkl√§rung (1983), Konflikt und Konsens. Studien zur Ethik der Verantwortung (1990), Friedensethik (1990, with Hans-Richard Reuter), Die t√§gliche Gewalt. Gegen den Ausverkauf der Menschenw√ºrde (1993), Gerechtigkeit und Recht. Grundlinien christlicher Rechtsethik (1996), Kirche in der Zeitenwende. Gesellschaftlicher Wandel und Erneuerung der Kirche (1998), Vertrauen erneuern. Eine Reform um der Menschen willen (2005), Im Geist der Freiheit. F√ºr eine √ñkumene der Profile (2007), Der christliche Glaube. Eine evangelische Orientierung (2008). As respected religious figure, academic and public intellectual Huber continues to initiate and contribute to a wide range of themes, amongst others by means of a large number of public lectures, sermons and public discussions. Research on Huber‚Äôs thought emphasizes the centrality of the concept ‚Äúcommunicative freedom‚Äù in his work.Willem Fourie, Communicative freedom? Wolfgang Huber's critical engagement of modernity. Doctoral dissertation: University of Stellenbosch (South Africa) 2009. His theology and public engagement is characterized by the fact that Christianity is the religion of life-enabling freedom. He understands communicative freedom as a rearticulation of the Reformation‚Äôs rediscovery of freedom, as is clear in his use of Martin Luther‚Äôs theology to substantiate his understanding of freedom.See e.g. Wolfgang Huber, Kirche in der Zeitenwende (G√ºtersloher Verlagshaus, 1999), and the published version of his inaugural lecture at the Humboldt University in Berlin, ‚ÄúChristliche Freiheit in der freiheitlichen Gesellschaft‚Äù (Evangelische Theologie 56 (2): 99-116 Huber aims to reconcile individuality and sociality, by developing an understanding of freedom that transcends mere self-realisation. In his recent work he makes use of the term \\"responsible freedom\\" to denote this comprehensive understanding of freedom.Fourie, 2009:76ff Following the sociologist Max Weber, the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer and the philosopher Hans Jonas, Huber develops an ethics of responsibility for life in the context of modernity.Wolfgang Huber, Sozialethik als Verantwortungsethik, in Konflikt und Konsens (1990), 136-157 This forms the starting point for Huber‚Äôs contributions to present-day ethical questions, as can be seen in his contributions to business ethics,Huber: Wenn ihr umkehrt, wird euch geholfen. Oder: Anmerkungen zur globalen Finanzmarkt- und Wirtschaftskrise, Frankfurt/Main 2010 political ethicsVerfassung ohne Gottesbezug? Zu einer aktuellen europ√§ischen Kontroverse. Gemeinsam mit Helmut Goerlich und Karl Kardinal Lehmann, Leipzig 2004 and bio-ethics.Der gemachte Mensch. Christlicher Glaube und Biotechnik, Berlin 2002 Huber is known for his opposition to embryology research. He understands human dignity as conferred by God, and expressed by the Christian conviction that the human person is created in the ‚Äúimage of God‚Äù.Huber: Nicht Sache, sondern Person; in: ders.: Der gemachte Mensch; Berlin 2002; S. 19 Human dignity cannot be equated with either the biological development or genetic characteristics as this contradicts the human person as subject of freedom.Huber: Nicht Sache, sondern Person; in: ders.: Der gemachte Mensch; Berlin 2002; S. 21 In Huber's view a human being is always a person and never simply an object. He advocates a form of nonviolence he calls \\"reasonable pacifism\\". Church reform As bishop and chairperson of the EKD‚Äôs Council Huber initiated and supported numerous reform programs. In the context of the challenges mainline Protestantism face, especially in the eastern parts of Germany, Huber advocated for a missionary reorientation of the church. For him church reform is closely connected to the rediscovery of the church‚Äôs evangelical essence and requires openness to those who have distanced themselves from the Christian faith. These impulses characterize the large-scale reform process, subsumed under the theme ‚ÄúChurch of freedom‚Äù, which Huber headed. The document Kirche der Freiheit describes how the church can set its profile in society, whilst respecting societal plurality. This document formulates four goals for the reform of the Protestant church in Germany, namely (a) spiritual profiling instead of indistinct activity, (b) prioritising instead of aiming for completeness, (c) structural mobility and (d) shifting the focus of the activities of the church to the outside instead of self-contentment.EKD 2006, Kirche der Freiheit, 7ff In his own regional church Huber also oversaw a reform process, ‚ÄúSalt of the earth‚Äù. Huber‚Äôs tenure as chairperson of the EKD‚Äôs Council also saw the incorporation of the Vereinigte Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche Deutschlands and the Union Evangelischer Kirchen with the EKD, the streamlining of regional churches from 23 to 21, and the initiation of further reform processes. Ecumenical and inter-religious engagement Huber continuously engages in ecumenical and inter-religious discussions.Klarheit und gute Nachbarschaft. Christen und Muslime in Deutschland. Eine Handreichung des Rates der EKD (EKD- Texte 86), Hannover 2006. He was the hosting bishop of the first Ecumenical Church Conference in Berlin in 2003, and during his meeting with Pope Benedict XVI in Cologne in 2005 Huber expressed the wish that ecumenical relations may develop to a phase of ‚Äúprofiled ecumenism‚Äù. This position also characterized his reaction to the Vatican‚Äôs declaration in 2007 that Protestant churches cannot be regarded as churches in the true sense of the word. The Archbishop of Canterbury invited Huber to address the Nikaean Club of Archbishops in 2009, where Huber identified ‚Äúecumenism of the indicative‚Äù ‚Äì namely borne from the conferred unity in Christ, of faith and of baptism ‚Äì as the basis for all ecumenical relations. Huber regards religious pluralism as a defining characteristic of contemporary society. He understands the growing influence of Muslim minorities in western Europe (and particularly in his native Germany) as a legitimate example of growing religious pluralism. As chairperson of the EKD Huber campaigned for an open and regular dialogue between Christian and Muslim religious leaders. His insistence on clarity (‚ÄúKlarheit‚Äù) and being good neighbours (‚Äúgute Nachbarschaft) ‚Äì following a document published by the EKD ‚Äì led to controversies within the EKD and between Protestants and Muslim conversation partners.See e.g. www.versoehnungsbund.de/archiv/.../StellungnahmeEKDpapier.pdf or islam.de/8443.php. Especially his warning not to engage in ‚Äúinterreligious cheating‚Äù (a formulation which he articulated for the first time in 2001) gave rise to a number of public discussions.Der Spiegel, 17. Dezember 2001, S. 44 - 56 A prominent German Muslim organisation reacted to the document published by the EKD by saying that it reinforces and legitimates existing prejudices against Islam.Evangelischer Pressedienst, 24. Mai 2007 Huber reacted by stating the continued need for honest dialogue ‚Äì including controversial themes such as freedom of religion and of the change of religion in Muslim countries.

Under the original application, each investment was expected to adhere to risk standards on its own merits, limiting the ability of investment managers to make any investments deemed potentially risky. Under the revised 1978 interpretation, the concept of portfolio diversification of risk, measuring risk at the aggregate portfolio level rather than the investment level to satisfy fiduciary standards would also be accepted.Private Equity Pioneer Golder Dies.

(1542‚Äì1602), was a Danish physician, and one of the most significant followers of Paracelsus. His works include the major treatise Idea medicinae philosophicae (Ideal of Philosophical Medicine) (1571), which asserted the superiority of the ideas of Paracelsus to those of Galen.PARACELSUS: The Medical Chemistry of the Paracelsians Severinus was a member of Denmark's intellectual elite. His education was supported by the Danish crown and his eventual appointment as royal physician conferred status and authority to his work and opinions. He was a contemporary and intellectual and personal associate of Tycho Brahe who likewise is associated with the evolution of chemistry during the seventeenth century. Daniel Sennert, a professor at Wittenberg wrote in 1619 that most chemical physicians followed the lead of Severinus and even referred to a ‚ÄúSeverinian School‚Äù of medical theory, which was based on the philosophy of Paracelsus.Jole Shackelford, A Philosophical Path for Paracelsian Medicine: The Ideas, Intellectual Context, and Influence of Petrus Severinus (1540/2-1602) (Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 2004). Scholars including Jole Shackelford and Hiro Hirai (Le concept de semences dans les th√©ories de la mati√®re √† la Renaissance, 2005) have claimed that Severinus was an important predecessor of both Johann Baptista von Helmont and Pierre Gassendi.  Early life  Peder S√∏rensen, later known by his Latinized name Petrus Severinus, was born in the Danish town of Ribe on the west coast of Jutland in either 1542 or 1540. Both years are cited in seventeenth century texts. Ribe was a flourishing town on a major trade route between the farmers of Jutland and their markets to the south. It was also a harbor town that supported regular trade with Holland, England, and other port towns of the Frisian coast. Ribe was also an administrative center with the cathedral at Ribe governed by one of the most important sees in sixteenth century Denmark. Severinus‚Äô parents were probably prosperous and well-positioned and like other sons of the well to do, Severinus probably enrolled in Ribe‚Äôs Latin or cathedral school before moving on to universities abroad or the university at Copenhagen. After the Reformation, the Catholic hierarchy was replaced with Lutheran masters and administrators, but the curriculum is unlikely to have changed much. The cathedral at Ribe was administered by some of the greatest humanist reformers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, including Hans Tausen, Peder Hegelund, and Jens Dinesen Jersin providing Severinus with the best education available in Denmark at the time.  Academic Life  Some time around the late 1550s, Severinus entered the University of Copenhagen. While enrolled he probably followed the standard European undergraduate curriculum, which prescribed texts based on the writings and commentaries of Aristotle. Copenhagen as a reformed university allowed for the study of natural philosophy or ‚ÄúPhillippist‚Äù humanism named after Philipp Melanchthon. Philosophy at the University of Copenhagen comprised three branches: logic (grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric), physics (mathematics, physiology, and metaphysics), and ethics. Severinus‚Äô first exposure to basic academic medicine probably came during his physiology and metaphysics classes, which were largely Aristotelian-based. In 1562, Severinus left Copenhagen and headed to France to begin medical studies, but returned a year later due to a lack of funding. In 1563 King Frederick II offered Severinus a canonry position as a doctor in Viborg, which was probably used to fund a stipend for three years of medical studies. When and where Severinus ultimately earned his medical degree remains unclear. Severinus was promoted to the level of master in 1564 under the direction of Nicolaus Laurentius Scavenius, who held the chair in mathematics and later physics at the University of Copenhagen. These subjects covered the philosophical groundwork for medicine, including generation and corruption‚Äîthemes Severinus would return to again and again throughout his life. It was in fact his theories on these subjects that earned him international acclaim. In 1571 Severinus was officially named the physician to King Frederick II until his death in 1588. He then attended to Christian IV who at the time was a minor. When Christian became fully vested as king in 1592, he hired additional physicians while still employing Severinus who retained his title and income. For the last ten years of his life, Severinus enjoyed relative freedom from official duties, yet failed to produce any additional writings since his influential work, Idea medicin√¶ philosophic√¶ in 1571.Jole Shackelford, ‚ÄúEarly Reception of Paracelsian Theory: Severinus and Erastus,‚Äù The Sixteenth Century Journal 26, no. 1 (April 1, 1995): 134.  Severinus and Paracelsianism  Severinus very early in his career was drawn to the teachings and writing of the German medical reformer Theophrastus Paracelsus (1493-1541). Severinus‚Äô Idea medicin√¶ philosophicae (1571) is his most important written work, which interprets the teachings of Paracelsus. Digital edition by the University and State Library D√ºsseldorf Although Paracelsus‚Äô writings are difficult to discern, his primary contribution to the study of medicine rests on his assertions that medicine could only be learned and improved through a study of nature grounded in Christian principles. Paracelsus also stressed a reliance on chemistry to prepare certain formularies for the treatment of disorders. While a medical student, Severinus began to hear of the success of certain Paracelsian medicines and began to read Paracelsus‚Äô writings. While these writings were rather obscure, Severinus persisted in understanding the concepts through his own empirical experiments and by applying the teachings of ancient Greeks in matters of theory and observation. Severinus increasingly found traditional Aristotelian and Galenic medical methods unsatisfactory and likewise began to embrace chemistry and the teachings of Paracelsus to create efficacious drugs. The compounds most often relied on were those with ‚Äústrong manifest qualities‚Äù such as smell, which were believed to be an indication of their effectiveness. The toxicity of certain compounds would be addressed by applying chemical principles to negate the toxic qualities. The controversy with such a method, however, was that it was not always known whether a compound was toxic until it was ingested.  The Idea medicin√¶ philosophic√¶ of Severinus  Severinus' best known writing is Idea medicin√¶, published in Basel in 1571. The volume provides Severinus‚Äô interpretation of the metaphysical and physical foundations of medicine and natural change. It is believed this is Severinus‚Äô only work that fully illustrates his acceptance of Paracelsian writings. But it was deemed sufficiently important in the seventeenth century to produce two more editions and three extensive commentaries. Idea medicin√¶ focuses not only on medicine, but also ideological questions that impacted moral philosophy and religion. The book is essentially a philosophical discussion of the fundamental causes of change in natural bodies and calls into question the standard medical practices of the day which were based on Galenic medicine and the four humors of the body. Severinus believed that diseases had an organic cause. He theorized that seeds of disease (semina morborum) are foreign matter in a healthy body and take root, grow, and disrupt the normally orderly process of bodily functions. These seeds manifest themselves in various places in the body and produce particular symptoms that identify the disease. In order to restore health, chemically derived remedies could be produced and administered in order to restore bodily harmony.  Severinus‚Äô Legacy  Readers of Severinus‚Äô Id√¶ medicin√¶ were introduced to a new world of chemical philosophy. Although deeply rooted in Paracelsianism, Severinus‚Äô deciphering of Paracelsus essentially shed light on writings that arguably may have remained enigmatic. Incorporating chemical ideas into therapeutic practice received wide attention, especially in Denmark where Tycho Brahe was also engaged in the chemical arts and whose royal favor and patronage further advanced the emerging science of chemistry.Jole Shackelford, ‚ÄúParacelsianism and the Orthodox Lutheran Rejection of Vital Philosophy in Early Seventeenth-Century Denmark,‚Äù Early Science and Medicine 8, no. 3 (2003): 212. Thomas Erastus, Andreas Libavius and other anti-Paracelsianists however served to minimize Severinus‚Äô legacy. Libavious in particular attacked the occult sciences of any variety but crusaded especially against Paracelsus and any writings that supported him, including Severinus. On the other hand, Id√¶ medicin√¶‚Äôs impact on English natural philosophers can be discerned in the writings of Thomas Moffett (1553-1604), and Francis Bacon (1561-1626) who on the one hand vilified Paracelsus but admired the important synthesis contributed by Petrus Severinus.

Four of his monographs, published from 1968 to 1991, were reprinted in 2006 by theology publisher Wipf & Stock. Douglass's 2008 book, JFK and the Unspeakable, discusses the John F. Kennedy assassination as a conspiracy ordered by unknown parties and carried out by the CIA with help from the Mafia and elements in the FBI to put an end to Kennedy's effort to end the Cold War after the Cuban Missile Crisis. JFK and the Unspeakable was first published by Orbis Books in Maryknoll, New York (2008), and reprinted by Simon & Schuster's Touchstone Books (2010). Activism Douglass was a professor of religion at the University of Hawaii who first engaged in civil disobedience to protest against the Vietnam War. In 1975 Jim and Shelley Douglass founded Ground Zero Center for Nonviolent Action to protest against the construction of a Trident missile nuclear submarine base on the Kitsap Peninsula in the U.S. state of Washington. The Douglasses, joined by other activists seeking to prevent the installation of Trident missiles, formed a small intentional community, the Pacific Life Community, near the submarine base. Their goal was > to \\"seek the truth of a nonviolent way of life,\\" both personally and > politically. Personally we tried to confront our racism, sexism, consumerism > ‚Äî all the isms that allowed us to violate others.

A distinctive species with almost no look-alike other than the narcissus flycatcher. It breeds in eastern Asia including parts of Mongolia, Transbaikal, southern China, Korea and western Japan. They winter in parts of the Malay Peninsula and South Asia. Identification In all plumages the yellow rump is distinctive. The white supercilium of the male is distinctive, separating it from the narcissus flycatcher and the Chinese flycatcher. Females and first year males are olive grey above with blackish tail. Hartert (1910) treated this as a part of the narcissina group. Some individuals with yellow supercilium have been considered as hybrids with the narcissus flycatcher. Included in this species complex was the species called Elise's flycatcher, usually treated as a subspecies of the narcissus flycatcher. Both elisae and zanthopygia have been observed to breed separately in the same area of oak forest near Peking strengthening the case for their distinctness. There are also clear call and morphological difference between the two. The genus Muscicapa has been noted to have been polyphyletic and is still in the process of being resolved although the genus Ficedula is now considered monophyletic with their origins in east Asia, with diversification following climate changes in the Pliocene. Male have black upperparts with white supercilium and wingpatch, rich yellow underparts and rump. Female have greyish or olive-green above, paler below, with wingbar and yellow rump. May show yellow on throat.Woo-Shin Lee, Tae-Hoe Koo, Jin-Young Park (2005). A field guide to the birds of Korea. p. 248. . Ecology The breeding area of the species is in Manchuria, Korea and China. The nesting in Xiaoxingan region is mainly in May and June. They breed mainly in low valleys at the base of hills. The home range of a pair can be about 2000-5000 sq. m. The nest is built in about three to four days by the female alone. The clutch is 4-7 eggs which are incubated by the female alone for about 11‚Äì12 days. The adults forage within about of the nest to feed the chicks. The young fledge after 14‚Äì15 days. It was first noted to winter in central India in 1989, it has since been found to winter in southwestern India and Sri Lanka.

Background Jet Pilot was sired by the 1930 Epsom Derby winner, Blenheim, out of the mare Black Wave, a daughter of the French-bred sire Sir Gallahad III. Blenheim and Sir Gallahad were both brought to stand at stud in the United States by groups of American horsemen, both of which were led by Arthur B. Hancock of Claiborne Farm. Black Wave's dam Black Curl was a half-sister to Myrtlewood, the female- line ancestor of Seattle Slew and Mr Prospector. Jet Pilot was purchased for US$41,000 at the Keeneland Yearling Sale by Elizabeth Arden and raced under her Maine Chance Farm colors. Racing career Racing at age two, Jet Pilot was second in the 1946 Arlington Futurity and third in that year's Futurity Stakes and Champagne Stakes. However, he won the important Tremont Stakes and Pimlico Futurity. One of the winter-book favorites for the 1947 Kentucky Derby, Jet Pilot broke from post position thirteen and immediately took the lead in the 73rd edition of the Derby and never relinquished it in defeating C. V. Whitney's betting favorite, Phalanx. In the Preakness Stakes, the second leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series, Jet Pilot finished fourth behind Calumet Farm's winner, Faultless. After the Preakness, Jet Pilot contested the Withers Stakes at Belmont Park, where he finished fourth. He bowed a tendon in that race and was retired to stud for the 1948 season.

Goodwin's incredible tale of his encounter in the Trans-Himalayan mountains to the world, to let everyone know the terrible fate Goodwin's group barely escaped and the possibility of other such monsters out there. Plot summary Dr. Goodwin is on a botanical expedition in the Himalayas. There he meets Dick Drake, the son of one of his old science acquaintances. They are witnesses of a strange aurora-like effect, but seemingly a deliberate one. As they go out to investigate, they meet Goodwin's old friends Martin and Ruth Ventnor, brother and sister scientists. The two are besieged by Persians as Darius III led when Alexander of Macedon conquered them more than two thousand years ago. The group is saved by a magnificent woman they get to know as Norhala. She commands the power of lightning and controls strange metal animate Things, living, metallic, geometric forms; an entire city of sentient cubes, globes and tetrahedrons, capable of joining together and forming colossal shapes, and wielding death rays and other armaments of destruction. They are led to a hidden valley occupied by what they name \\"The Metal Monster\\", a strange metal city occupied by the metal animate Things Norhala commands. This city is governed by what they call the Metal Emperor, assisted by the Keeper of the Cones. Ruth is slowly being converted by Norhala to become like her; her little sister.

She is best known for her portraits of fictitious subjects painted in muted colours. Her work has contributed to the renaissance in painting the Black figure. Early life and Career Lynette Yiadom-Boakye was born in London, UK where she currently lives and works. Her parents worked as nurses for the National Health Service after emigrating from Ghana. Yiadom-Boakye attended Central St Martins College of Art and Design, however did not enjoy her time there and so moved to Falmouth College of Art where she eventually graduated in 2000, and completed an MA degree at the Royal Academy Schools in 2003. In 2010, her work was recognised by Okwui Enwezor who gave her an exhibition at Studio Museum in Harlem . In addition to her artwork, Yiadom-Boakye has taught at the Ruskin School of Art, Oxford University where she is a visiting tutor for their Master in Fine Arts programme. Her influence as an Artist was recognised in the 2019 Powerlist and she was subsequently listed in the Top 10 of the most influential people of African or African Caribbean heritage in the UK in 2020.  Work  = Artworks = Yiadom-Boakye's work consists mostly of painted portraits of fictional Black subjects. Her paintings are predominantly figurative with raw and muted colours. The characteristic dark palette of her work is known for creating a feeling of stillness that contributes to the timeless nature of her subjects. Her portraits of fictional individuals feature people reading, lounging and resting in traditional poses. She brings to the depiction of her subjects contemplative facial expressions and relaxed gestures, making their posture and mood relatable to many viewers. Commentators have attributed some of the acclaim of Yiadom-Boakye‚Äôs work to its relatability. The artist strives to keep her subjects from being associated with a particular decade or time. This results in choices like not painting shoes on her subjects as footwear often serves as a time stamp. These figures usually rest in front of ambiguous backgrounds, floating inside monochromatic dark hues. These cryptic but emotional backdrops remind commentators of old masters like Velasquez and Degas. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye's style shifted slightly after the opening of her 2017 show \\"In Lieu of a Louder Love\\". The show featured a new, warmer colour scheme. Her subjects in this show included more vibrant details such as a checkered, linoleum-floor, a bold headwrap and bathing suit and a yellow, orange and green background. Though each portrait generally only contains one person, they are typically presented in groups arranged like family portraits. With her expressive representations of the human figure, the artist examines the formal mechanisms of the medium of painting and reveals political and psychological dimensions in her works, which focus on fictional characters who exist beyond our world in a different time and in an unknown location. She paints figures that are intentionally removed from time and place, and has stated, ‚ÄúPeople ask me, ‚ÄòWho are they, where are they?‚Äô What they should be asking is ‚ÄòWhat are they?‚Äô ‚Äù = Writing = For an artist, she is unusual in describing herself as a writer as much as a painter‚Äîher short stories and prosy poems frequently appear in her catalogues. Lynette Yiadom-Boakye's talks about her writing is to her as her painting and explains that \\"she writes the things she doesn't paint and paint all the things she doesn't write.\\" Her paintings have artist poetic names.

Malin Matsdotter or Mattsdotter, also known as Rumpare-Malin (1613 ‚Äì 5 August 1676) was an alleged Swedish witch. She is known as one of few people in Sweden confirmed to have been executed by burning for witchcraft, and the only one to be executed by this method during the famous witch hunt Det Stora ov√§sendet ('The Great Noise') in Sweden during 1668‚Äì1676, which ended with her execution. Early life Malin Matsdotter was according to protocol of Finnish heritage: she herself later stated in court protocol that she originally learned her prayers in the Finnish language. She married Erik Nilsson, who worked within the manufacture of nails and other metal threads, and had two daughters with him: Anna Eriksdotter and Maria Eriksdotter. In 1668, her spouse was executed for having had intercourse with a cow. He had been reported by their eldest daughter Anna, at that time thirteen years old, who reported him after the sisters had been brought home after having run away from home because of the beatings of their father, after which their father ordered their mother to beat them again. During the beating, Anna reportedly said to her father: \\"God knows mother beats, and You beats, and I shall no longer remain silent, such a sin You have committed, all the time standing on a chair over our black cow like a roster over a hen.\\"Lennartsson, Rebecka & Lennartsson, Rebecka, Fr√•n skuggsidan : folk och f√∂rbrytelser ur Stockholms historia, Stockholmia, Stockholm, 2014 Malin Matsdotter remarried a man by the name Anders Arendtsson. After her remarriage her daughters left home, stating the frequent arguments between her and her new spouse as a reason. Very little is known about Malin Matsdotter, other than fragments that came forward during her trial, which was also not much. Her profession is unknown: she is mentioned to have been active as a midwife at one occasion, but it is not known whether it was her regular profession.Per-Johan √ñdman (in Swedish) : Kontrasternas spel I (\\"The play of contrasts\\") (1995) Though described as poor, in 1676, she owned her own house in Mariaberget in Stockholm, and she had been hired as a midwife by Anna Zippel (also accused in the same witch trial), but there is no information that she was a professional midwife, and she is not referred to as such in the court protocols. In court protocol she is referred to by the sobriquet \\"Rumpare Malin\\": the meaning of the word \\"Rumpare\\" is unknown, but it is similar to the term \\"Rumpoxe\\", which was a contemporary pejorative used for \\"stupid\\" people. Since 1668, a national witch hunt raged through Sweden since the accusation of M√§ret Jonsdotter by Gertrud Svensdotter in Dalarna, resulting in the establishment of witch commissions around the nation and execution of about 280 people, accused of abducting children to the Witches' Sabbath of Satan in Blockula and often judged upon the testimonies of children.Alf √Öberg: H√§xorna. De stora trolldomsprocesserna i Sverige 1668‚Äì1676 (The witches. The great witch trials of Sweden in 1668‚Äì1676) The Swedish witch frenzy reached its peak with the Tors√•ker witch trials in 1675, and reached the capital of Stockholm the same year with the G√§vle-Boy, which lead to a witch trial in the congregation of Katarina Church, known as Katarina witch trial, were children and teenagers of the Katarina parish started to follow the example of the G√§vle Boy by pointing out women for abducting them to Satan. By May 1676, the Katarina witch trial had resulted in the execution of the sisters Brita and Anna Zippel, Maria J√∂nsdotter, Margareta Matsdotter and Anna Persdotter L√§rka, as well as death in prison by suicide of Anna M√•nsdotter and Karin Johansdotter. Trial In July 1676, Malin Matsdotter was reported for witchcraft by her nineteen-year- old daughter Maria Eriksdotter. Her reported stated: :\\"The true daughter of Rumpare Malin, Maria Eriksdotter age nineteen, were called upon and confessed that she had the same night been abducted by Anna Wife of Staffan, who sells beer at Dalar√∂, to whom she had been lost at games by her mother [...] Last Easter Evening her mother allegedly said to her: My daughter do you wish to follow me and we will make people out of you [...] thereafter she began to take her every night [to Blockula] [...] the second time [she travelled to Blockula] upon a man. Confessed aside that her mother had always had a bad language, cursed and used ugly words, particularly on great holy days.\\" Malin Matsdotter were questioned and cautioned to tell the truth. She was thoroughly questioned regarding her religious instruction. When asked to recite the Creed, she answered that she could not bother to read and barely knew the Lord's Prayer. Her language difficulties attracted attention when she had difficulty reading the prayers the court instructed her to: she did not know them herself, and even had trouble repeating them when they were read to her. The court noted that she hesitated in a suspicious way when she was to repeat the prayers word by word. The fact that she had trouble reading was in fact uncommon in 17th-century Stockholm: since the Swedish Church Ordinance 1571, every citizen regardless of class or sex was by law required to be able to read, so that they may be able to read the bible. The fact that she seems to have preferred Finnish was not considered strange by the court, as the capital had a great Finnish minority from the nearby province who even had their own congregation; however, what was regarded suspicious for a person accused of consorting with the Devil was, rather, the fact that she had difficulty to read and pronounce words from the holy scripture. Her daughter Maria Eriksdotter testified that Malin took both her and several children to Satan in Blockula, and that Satan himself, \\"The Mean One\\" appeared in court, long, black and with horns, standing by her mother, holding her skirt and whispered in her ear never to confess. Malin was ordered by the court to fall on her knees and pray to be able to confess, and after having obeyed, her daughter stated that she could no longer see the Devil. Ten year old boy Matthias Wallendorph and seven-year-old girl Margreta J√∂ransdotter both testified to have been abducted by Malin to Blockula, and they supported Maria Eriksdotter in her words that Satan appeared behind Malin, cautioned her not to confess. The married woman Gertrud Mattsdotter testified that Malin had abducted her children to Satan sixteen times before losing them in a game to another woman accused of sorcery, Anna Simonsdotter Hack, called Tysk-Annika ('German- Annika'), and that Malin had abducted them fourteen times while in prison. The children of Gertrud Mattsdotter testified that they had been beaten by Malin to prevent them from testifying, and Gertrud Mattsdotter testified that she had seen her children endure fits while being supernaturally beaten by Malin from prison, and that she would rather see them died than suffer, and that she would kill Malin herself if she was not executed. Gertrud Mattsdotter's daughter Annika asked Malin if she had not played with Tysk-Annika about who was going to light fire to the palace of count Per, but Malin refused to confirm this. Malin's older daughter Anna Eriksdotter supported her sister's testimony that their mother took them to Satan, but when she stated that she herself had started to abduct children there herself, she was also placed under arrest. The court did ask Maria Eriksdotter if she was trying to have her mother executed in order to inherit her house, but she denied it. Malin's husband is not mentioned much during the trial and was never called to testify. Malin Matsdotter was asked by the court to fall upon her knees and repeat a prayer read to her, but she did not succeed before her 11th attempt, which was given great importance by the court. She had at one point been hired as a midwife by Anna Zippel, who had previously been executed for witchcraft, and she commented that if she had ever taken anyone to Blockula, which she denied, then in that case, she would have learned it from Anna Zippel. The court was convinced of her guilt by the testimony of her own daughters combined with her lack of religious knowledge and difficulty to read prayers. She commented the testimony of her daughters with the words: \\"My God, let them go there [Blockula] for ever\\", and stated that she did not mind dying when her own daughters testified against her. Her daughters were questioned again and stood by their testimonies, as Malin stood by her denial. Such firm denial was often regarded as a sign that the Devil assisted the witch to withstand interrogations. She accused her daughters of a bad lifestyle and when the court asked her to specify, she answered with such language that her answer was in fact never written down in the court protocols, because they were \\"offensive to decent ears\\". Execution On 16 July 1676, Malin Matsdotter was judged guilty as charged by a unanimous court on the testimonies of her daughters and sentenced to be executed. The method of execution was the subject of debate in the royal witchcraft commission, who was to decide between three alternatives; the first was the customary execution by decapitation followed by public burning of the corpse; the second was that she would be subjected to torture prior to the first alternative; and the third alternative was that she would be executed by being burned alive. The last alternative was given the majority vote. The clerical commissioner Carolinus stated in his vote that the honor of God should be regarded before the personal pain of Malin and that she should be given a taste of what was awaiting her in Hell after having seduced so many souls to Satan; commissioners Ivar and Noreus motivated their vote by the deterring effect such a method would have upon the public and her accomplices, and commissioner doctor Urban Hj√§rne suggested that she be tortured with hot iron prior to the execution, which would make her unconscious and unable to feel pain, because her death would otherwise be too cruel, but the suggestion was revoked with the view, expressed by a priest, that the honour of the name of God was more important than Malin's personal experience of pain; the method was also deemed necessary as an example to the public and to her accomplices. She was instead to have a bag of gunpowder secured around her neck to make her death quicker. Because the court was convinced of her guilt, her refusal to admit guilt made her position worse on the eyes of the court. One suggestion was, that at the place of execution, she would be given a last chance to confess her sin; if she did so, she would be decapitated before she was burned. The method of execution make the case of Malin Matsdotter unique in Sweden. She was the only person of the almost 300 people executed during the great Swedish witch hunt of 1668‚Äì76, to be executed by being burned alive instead of by decapitation followed by public burning of the corpse, which was the normal execution for sorcery in Sweden. Though several crimes formally allowed for public burning as method of execution, this actually meant that the condemned be \\"executed and burned\\", which meant that they were first executed by decapitation or hanging, after which their corpse was publicly burned: the method of burning someone still alive is only known to have been used in the country a very few times before, and the verdict was therefore controversial. Malin Matsdotter was the last person to be executed by burning in the capital of Stockholm, and the second to last to be executed by burning in Sweden. No other person executed for sorcery in Sweden is confirmed to have been burned alive. Because of this, she has sometimes also been regarded the only one in Sweden to be executed by burning for sorcery altogether. However, though decapitation was the customary method, they were likely at least some cases in the early 17th- century were this method may have been used. The method of execution by burning had been debated by the commission in Stockholm previously during the Catharina witch trial of 1675‚Äì76 and actually given to an earlier condemned, Anna L√§rka, for her refusal to admit guilt, but it was retracted when she finally did so. In the case of Matsdotter, the sentence was to be carried out. The execution was performed in the square of H√∂torget in Stockholm the 5 August 1676. Malin Matsdotter was to be executed alongside Anna \\"Annika\\" Simonsdotter Hack, known as \\"Tysk-Annika\\", who had also been accused and sentenced to death on the testimony of her own children, but was to be executed the normal way by decapitation before burning. The contrast between the behavior of the two have been noted. Anna Simonsdotter was described as full humility and respect and behaved as was expected by her, and though she did not directly say that she was guilty, she behaved as was expected of her, and \\"by her remorse, by her psalms, and by falling on her knees and lifting her head and her hands to the sky, confirmed the justice in the verdict and the justice in the world\\".Peter Englund: F√∂rflutenhetens landskap (The country of past times) According to contemporary witnesses, Malin Matsdotter behaved with great dignity and courage during her execution. When asked to take the hand of her daughter to make peace with her before death, she refused. She \\"did not seem to fear death much, courageously mounting the stake\\", and even the official execution protocol noted that she \\"was very tough\\". She spoke calmly with the executioner, \\"allowing him to fasten her with iron by her hands and feet\\", and the bag of gunpowder was placed around her neck to hasten death. She talked back to the priests with her head held high when they pleaded with her to acknowledge her sin, maintaining her innocence. When her daughter cried out and appealed to her to admit her crimes \\"Malin delivered her daughter in the hands of the Devil and cursed her for eternity\\". The daughter in question would have been Maria Eriksdotter, as Anna Eriksdotter was herself in arrest as the time. The execution in itself was described: :\\"But though all of this was both horrifying and pathetic to look upon, those who suffered death did not shed one tear but stood by their standpoint of innocence with an unnatural courage\\". Tradition claims that Malin Matsdotter did not scream but died in silence, in accordance with contemporary view that witches felt no pain. Aftermath The execution of Malin Matsdotter did in fact signify the end of the Katarina witch trial in Stockholm and the end of the national 1668‚Äì76 witch hunt in Sweden. Some of the judges in the commission, notably Urban Hj√§rne and Eric Noraeus, begun to express skepticism toward the child witnesses and instigate a different interrogation technique against them by asking them to repeat their testimonies rather than to affirm their already given testimonies. This was particularly brought about since the child witnesses had started to accuse people from the upper classes, such as the Captains wife Margareta Staffansdotter Remmer and Maria Sofia De la Gardie. This resulted in the break down of one witness, Annika Thomsdotter, in court on 11 September 1676, which snowballed into other witnesses to retract their testimonies and blamed the leading witnesses, the G√§vle Boy, Lisbeth Carlsdotter and the Myra Maids to have convinced them to perjure themselves. Seventeen child- and teenage witnesses admitted perjury. This efficiently discontinued the Katarina witch trial. The remaining accused, Margareta Staffansdotter Remmer, Karina Ambj√∂rnsdotter and Margareta Matsdotter Dufva, were freed, and the courts instead prosecuted the witnesses for perjury, leading to both executions and physical punishments. The leading perjurers, the G√§vle Boy, Lisbeth Carlsdotter and the Myra Maids (Annika Hinrichzdotter and Agnis Eskilsdotter), were executed on 20 December 1676. The daughter of Brita Zippel, Annika Zippel, were sentenced to be whipped and died during the punishment. The oldest daughter of Malin Matsdotter, Anna \\"Annika\\" Eriksdotter, was herself under arrest after having stated during her testimony against her mother that she had herself begun to follow her example by abducting children to Satan. Imprisoned, she reported that she heard her mother call for her in her dreams, pinch her and ask her to \\"come as soon as possible\\" because she had accused her of witch craft. Anna Eriksdotter was, as the other remaining accused, freed from the charge of witch craft, but sentenced to be whipped for perjury. During the whipping, the crowd attacked the guards performing the whipping by throwing stones. Malin's younger daughter Maria Eriksdotter was given an official warning to make amends for her sin of perjury. Malin Matsdotter was the last person to be executed for witch craft in Stockholm, the last person to be executed by burning in Stockholm, and the second last to be executed by burning in Sweden, next to Lars Nilsson (shaman) in 1693. In 1677, all the priests of the country were ordered to proclaim in their churches that the witches had now been expelled from the country forever, in order to avoid further witch trials. This ended the great Swedish witch hunt of 1668‚Äì76. Though there were accusations after this, few people were executed for sorcery after the year of 1676. The last execution for witchcraft took place 1704 when Anna Eriksdotter was decapitated, the last person to be executed for sorcery in Sweden. Legacy Malin Matsdotter is the role model for the novel Dj√§vulens M√§rke by Magnus Nordin. She is a central figure in the children's book series Jakten p√• Jack by Martin Olczak.

On December 7, 1994, the 50-ton stone bearing the petroglyphs fell from a sandstone cliff above the Red Bird River, onto Kentucky Route 66 at Lower Red Bird. On December 9, 1994, it was transported to its present location in Rawlings/Stinson Park in Manchester, where it is roofed over and fenced. The original site was enrolled on the National Register of Historic Places in September 1989, but was delisted in 2003 after the inscribed stone was relocated. The petroglyphs as currently displayed at Rawlings/Stinson Park in Manchester The inscribed surface measures 1.6 m (5.5 ft) in height and 6 m (20 ft) in length. The sharply incised and linear carvings have been described as \\"different from any of the previously reported Kentucky petroglyphs.\\" Construction and later widening of Highway 66 undermined the inscribed surface and left it 16 feet above the roadway. It is estimated that it was originally at chest height before construction of the highway. A state historical marker on the river attributes the markings to the Cherokee Chief Red Bird, for whom the river was named. Dr. Kenneth Tankersley of the University of Cincinnati reports that Chief Red Bird (Dotsuwa, literally \\"Cardinal\\") spent considerable time hunting and trapping in the vicinity of two rock shelters on opposite banks of the river. In 1796 or early 1797, he and his Cherokee friend Will Emory were brutally murdered for their furs by two white men near the Red Bird River Petroglyphs on the east bank. They are thought to have been buried in the Red Bird River Shelter Petroglyphs site on the west bank. Red Bird's descendants frequently visit the two sites.Kenneth Barnett Tankersley, \\"Red Bird (Dotsuwa) and the Cherokee History of Clay County, Kentucky\\", Appalachian Quarterly September 2006The first reference to the still-recent murder was in January, 1797. Tankersley notes that the state historical market erroneously identifies the friend as \\"Jack.\\" According to Tankersley, the left portion of the Red Bird River Petroglyphs includes traditional Cherokee symbols for the Deer and Bear clans, while the central portion includes symbols for the Chickamauga people and the story of their origin, as well as for the Bird and Bear clans.See the captions to his Figs. 11 and 12.

Her media included drawing, painting, sculpture and mosaic.  Early life  Mirka Mora was born in Paris, to a Lithuanian Jewish father, Leon Zelik, and a Romanian Jewish mother, Celia Gelbein. She was arrested in 1942 during the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup (Rafle du Vel' d'Hiv). Her father, Leon, managed to arrange for her release from the concentration camp at Pithiviers (Loiret) before Mora and her mother, Celia, were scheduled to be deported to Auschwitz. The family evaded arrest and deportation from 1942 to 1945 by hiding in the forests of France. After the war, Mora met a wartime resistance fighter Georges Mora in Paris at the age of 17. They married in 1947. In an interview in 2004, Mora said: Migration to Australia Having survived the Holocaust, Mora and her husband migrated to Australia in 1951 in order to settle in Melbourne. They chose Melbourne over Casablanca or Saigon because Mirka had read about it in Henri Murger's novel Sc√®nes de la Vie de Boh√®me, in which a young Parisian photographer makes regular trips to Melbourne to make his fortune.Wicked But Virtuous (2000) They occupied studios in Grosvenor Chambers in the 'Paris End' of Collins Street, and quickly became key figures on the Melbourne cultural scene. Georges became an influential art dealer, and in 1967 he founded one of the first commercial art galleries in Melbourne, the Tolarno Galleries. The Mora family also owned and operated three significant Melbourne caf√©s. The Mirka Caf√© was opened by Jean Sablon in December 1954 at 183 Exhibition Street and was the venue for the first major solo exhibition by Joy Hester. It was followed by the Caf√© Balzac at 62 Wellington Parade, East Melbourne and then by the Tolarno in Fitzroy Street in St Kilda, which opened in 1966, and where Mirka created a bas-relief behind the bar and painted murals on walls and windows of the restaurant and bistro, hallway and toilets, over the period 1965 to 1978. All three were focal points for Melbourne's bohemian subculture.Davison, G. (2001). The European City in Australia. Journal of Urban History, 27(6), 779-793. As Mora's son Philippe recalls, \\"my parents literally fed artists at our home and in our restaurants\\". In a 2004 interview Mora stated: The Mora family's social circle included many progressive Australian artists and writers: Charles Blackman and Barbara Blackman, Fred Williams, John Perceval, Albert Tucker, Barrett Reid, Laurence Hope, Arthur Boyd and Joy Hester. The Mora family were especially close friends with renowned art patrons John and Sunday Reed, and spent many weekends at their famous home and artists' colony \\"Heide\\" (now the Heide Museum of Modern Art) in the Melbourne suburb of Bulleen,Janine Burke (2004). The heart garden: Sunday Reed and Heide. Knopf, pp. 321, 348, 435. and at the Reeds' beach house next door to the Moras' own in Aspendale. Mora had three children, actor Tiriel Mora, film director Philippe Mora and art dealer William Mora. They had what Philippe describes as \\"a culturally privileged childhood\\". After extramarital relationships on both sides, Mora eventually separated from her husband Georges. Art: style and reception After coming to Australia in 1951, three years later Mora had become well known in art circles in Melbourne and, with patron friends John and Sunday Reed, was operative in reviving the Contemporary Art Society there. Mirka and Georges Mora, through the Contemporary Art Society and with Italian Gino Nibbi (1896-1969) who showed Tucker and Nolan at his Galleria di Quattro Venti in Rome, made strenuous efforts to have Australia accepted for the first time into the Venice Biennale,Sarah Scott (2003) Imaging a nation: Australia's representation at the Venice biennale, 1958, Journal of Australian Studies, 27:79, 51-63, DOI: 10.1080/14443050309387887 urging the inclusion of contemporary art to promote its alignment with Modernist practice of Australian immigrant artists from Europe and their influence on a reinvigoration of the country's art. Though they secured an exhibition, it was not a success, as the conservative Commonwealth Arts Advisory Board maintained control over the entries, sending outdated examples of the Heidelberg School and a few Arthur Boyd landscapes. The episode exacerbated the split between the traditionalist and modernist groups and was not until 1978 that Australia was finally represented at Venice under the auspices of the Australian Arts Council. Since 1954, Mora exhibited mainly with the CAS and in the Heide Museum of Modern Art, Douglas Galleries and Tolarno Galleries in Melbourne, and with Watters Gallery in Sydney. Mora innovatively used a wide range of media and large numbers of her works are in the permanent collection of the Heide Museum of Modern Art, in the National Gallery of Australia in the National Gallery of Victoria. They are also available to view in public places; in an external mural in Acland Street, St Kilda, a mosaic seat on the St Kilda foreshore, and as a mixed-media mural prominently displayed at Flinders Street Station in Melbourne.Victorian Heritage Database Report: Mirka Mora Mural, heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au; accessed 23 July 2020. The latter is nine metres long and about four meters high in three different techniques in the same artwork: painting in the upper register, mosaic in the middle, larger one, and painted low relief at the pavement level. Completed in 1986, in 1998, Mora restored the eroded lower part of the mural.Sabine Cotte. Conservation collaboration with Mirka Mora for three treatments of her public artworks (2012), AICCM Bulletin, 33:1, 80-89, DOI: 10.1179/bac.2012.33.1.010 Mora participated with Bruce Petty, Reg Mombassa, Ginger Riley and others in the production of the Federation Tapestry Suite in Melbourne Museum coordinated by artist Murray Walker and executed by the Victorian Tapestry Workshop to mark the Australian Centenary of Federation in 2001. In the sixth panel, she portrays Aboriginal leader Charles Perkins conversing with three white Australians.Marinelli, M., & Ricatti, F. (2013). 'Emotional geographies of the uncanny: Reinterpreting italian transnational spaces'. In Cultural Studies Review, 19(2), 5-18. Other major commissions include a painted Melbourne tram (1978), sets, costumes and masks for the ballet, Ivan the Terrible (1964), and the operas Medea and Bacchae (1979-80), and 85 1.5m puppets for the opera Bennelong. A noted colourist and symbolist, Mora's paintings are often bright and bold, constantly reinventing a repertoire of recurring motifs‚Äîinnocent, wide-eyed children, angels, dogs, cats, snakes and birds, and hybrids of animals and humans. = Critical assessment = Perceptions of Mora's work have evolved against the background of the Australian art scene and its changing levels of sophistication. Donald Brook, in reviewing the 1964 Paintings by the Aleph Group describes Mora's work as one of only two that were 'distinctively Jewish'. Robin Wallace-Crabbe, in his 1968 Canberra Times, critique 'Giving away high-mindedness' of Mora's show at the Australian Sculpture Gallery, Narrabundah, hints that though 'delightful' her work is na√Øve, \\"like a mixture of May Gibbs' 'Snugglepot and Cuddlepie' and the prevailing Melbourne style in the early fifties\\", while later, in 1981, Sonja Kaleski is more favourably analytical in her review 'Vibrant, Volatile Artist', in The Canberra Times: Mora's works and commentary on them have appeared in Australian Drawings by Elwyn Lynn, New painting, 1952-62 by John Reed, The Vital Decade by co-authors Geoffrey Dutton and Max Harris, and the Encyclopedia of Australian Art by Alan McCulloch. When Mora showed with Jean Dubuffet and Francois Mezzapelle in In Pursuit of Fantasy opening 18 October 1997 at George Gallery 129 Fitzroy Street, St. Kilda, Melbourne, the French language Le Courrier Australien reported'Dubuffet, Mezzapelle and Mora:in pursuit of fantasy'. In Le Courrier Australien, Monday 10 November 1997, page 21 that the vernissage was attended by 800 people, and described her work; Heidi curator Kendrah Morgan in a 2011 education kit listed Mora's wide range of influences:  Teaching  For many years Mora conducted workshops in painting, soft sculpture and mosaics, where countless Australians learned from her unique approach to teaching art. She travelled also to France, the USA and Japan to present her workshops. Later life and death Mora lived and worked in a number of studios in Melbourne, including Rankins Lane. Mora appeared as an interviewee on the ABC's conversational television programs Agony Aunts and The Agony of Life in 2012 and 2013. In 2016 Mora, for a long time a contributor of design to the fashion industry,Juliette Peers (2009) ‚ÄòLondon, Paris, New York, and Collingwood‚Äô: Reconsidering Pre-1945 Australian Fashion, Australian and New Zealand Journal of Art, 10:1, 119,n28, DOI: 10.1080/14434318.2009.11432604 collaborated with Australian fashion company Gorman to launch a 23 piece collection based on four artworks. Her murals survive on the walls of the Tolarno restaurant and gallery she previously owned in St. Kilda. In 2016, an East Melbourne bar-owner uncovered a lost mural on the wall of his establishment, previously the Caf√© Balzac. Mora died, aged 90, at her home in Melbourne on 27 August 2018. Honours In 2002, Mora was made an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Minister of Culture and Communication. Mirka Lane in St Kilda, off Barkly Street near the intersections of Grey and Inkerman Streets was named after the artist.https://goo.gl/maps/f7tLp1oZmoH2 Map location, Mirka Lane, St Kilda Exhibitions Mora had more than 35 solo exhibitions throughout her career, most in five galleries; the Contemporary Art Society, Heidi Museum of Modern Art, Douglas Galleries, Tolarno Galleries, and Watters Gallery.

In this novel, CHERUB agents James, Lauren, and Dana go to Australia to investigate a religious cult called the Survivors.  Plot  After finding a link in a successful mission in Hong Kong, James and Lauren Adams and Dana Smith are sent on a mission to Australia, posing as the children of an ASIS agent. Before leaving Kerry said to James that when he gets back they will try again on their relationship after he is done with his mission to infiltrate a cult. They have been sent to determine whether a cult, The Survivors, is associated with Help Earth and as such are sent to a \\"recruitment hotbed\\" area in Brisbane. The \\"family\\" starts going to cult meetings, and are eventually accepted into the commune. Lauren and James are accepted into an elite cult school in the Ark, the cult's headquarters. There, James befriends Rathbone \\"Rat\\" Regan, son of the cult's founder and the only other person in the ark immune to their brainwashing tactics. After a while, Lauren develops a crush on Rat, and he uses his influence with Susie Regan, one of his father's many wives, to get her and James jobs in the offices, rather than in the stifling warehouse or laundry rooms. Dana, meanwhile, extremely depressed about her unspectacular role in the mission, is summoned to the head of the commune's office. There, she and Eve, another cult member, are told that they are to participate in a Help Earth mission to blow up an oil tanker. Australian oil tankers are alerted about an attack, but in her discovery that the target is across the sea in Indonesia she attempts to warn the mission controllers, which fail, and she ends up having to stop the attack herself. She overpowers the other members of the boat, except Eve who escapes on a dinghy but is later found dead washed up on a beach after the mission. Back at the Ark, the cult leader, Joel Regan, dies sending the cult into a panic. His eldest daughter, nicknamed The Spider, takes over the cult and commands her followers to prepare for the apocalypse. Meanwhile, ASIS now knows of the links between Help Earth and the Survivors. Having been waiting for an excuse to attack the Ark, elite troops are sent in to destroy it, despite the CHERUB agents' warnings that the cult is well-prepared for such an event. Believing the ASIS attackers to be armies of the devil, the cult shoot down a helicopter and kill dozens of troops in the ASIS raid. In the lull that follows, James, Lauren and Rat (who discovered their identity as undercover agents) attempt an escape. However, they are captured by The Spider and locked in a room full of toddlers by a sadistic overseer. When they manage to overpower her, Lauren points out that they need to take the kids with them or risk them dying in the fight between ASIS and the cult. James reluctantly agrees, and they drag the half- asleep toddlers with them. Rat says that the most likely way out is through the sewage system, so they go there. James is making his way through the tank when an engineer appears. A brief moment of panic is proved unfounded as Rat persuades the man that he is on a divine mission. The man then offers to help them escape. The now nine-strong group escape, but the ark explodes after being rigged by the cult to kill ASIS soldiers, killing several dozen children inside the Ark and The Spider in the process. Rat is also reported dead by the media, but in actuality survived. With the mission over, Rat is recruited by CHERUB and starts going out with Lauren, who receives a black shirt, Dana is awarded a navy shirt, while all James gets is a stomach bug caught in the sewage system.

It is centered near coordinates 51¬∞40‚Ä≤ N, 101¬∞38‚Ä≤ W. Road access to the lake is via Highway 57, which passes by the south shore of Madge Lake as it connects Highway 5 to Manitoba Highway 83. Madge Lake is the largest body of water in Saskatchewan's Duck Mountain Provincial Park. The lake measures approximately 5 km by 5 km for a total surface area of 21 square kilometres. Recreational opportunities Madge Lake serves as Duck Mountain Provincial Park's central tourist attraction. Seasonal recreational activities in and around the lake include: fishing, hunting, hiking, bicycling, swimming, boating, water skiing, alpine skiing, cross country skiing, snowmobile riding, horseback riding, tobagganing, miniature golf, and 18-hole golf. The area also provides abundant wildlife viewing opportunities, especially in the immensely large local breeding flock of ducks and other waterfowl. A large (summer) seasonal campground and rental cabins are near its shores. Over 300 private vacation residences (cottages) can also be found around the lake. There are two public swimming beaches (Ministik Beach and Pickerel Point Beach) constructed with artificially supplied sand. There are four species of game fish in the lake; walleye (locally known as pickerel), northern pike (locally known as jackfish), yellow perch, and burbot. The lake also has a large population of white suckers and many smaller fish species. Fish catches are augmented with the stocking of walleye. However fishing pressure is high and catches remain moderate by local standards. Measures to protect the lake's sport fishery include special size limits for the lake, and the requirement that all fishing lures must have barb-less hooks. Although these measures seem to have been successful, the lake still produces very few trophy fish. Few of the other smaller lakes and ponds that surround Madge Lake support fish populations because of winter die-off, but Jackfish Lake, located 500m south of Highway 57, has been stocked with rainbow trout and tiger trout and is aerated to support the oxygen levels under the winter ice. Climate The climate of eastern Saskatchewan features extreme seasonal variation, with winter temperatures below ‚àí30 ¬∞C and summer temperatures above +30 ¬∞C not uncommon. The lake therefore has very distinct seasons. It is ice covered in winter, usually from mid-November to mid-April. And the ice is thick enough to walk on, snowmobile on, and even drive vehicles on, from mid-December to early March. During this winter season, snowmobile riding and ice fishing are primary recreations on the lake, while the surrounding park has facilities for both downhill and cross country skiing. Approximately 80 cm of snow accumulates in the area through the winter, slowly building depth until it begins to actively melt in spring, usually from early March through to early April. The lake itself is however usually not completely clear of ice until early May. The \\"summer season\\" traditionally starts on Victoria Day weekend (late May), and ends on Canadian Labour Day weekend (early September). The lake is warm enough for comfortable swimming from early July to late August, although hardy souls may extend this season by several weeks. The spring and fall seasons (March and April, and October and November, respectively) are the quietest times on the lake, as neither summer (water) or winter (snow) recreational activities are practical in those seasons. Environmental concerns The large amount of tourism development around the lake is the cause of growing environmental concern. Winter-time use of the park has especially increased with the development skiing and snowmobiling assets. The lake simply isn't as quiet as it used to be. The lake is now regarded as having reached its development potential and there exists considerable opposition to further development. Some proposed development projects - such as the increase in the number of cottages along the lake's northeastern shore - have been shelved, and probably abandoned. Also of concern is the lake's fluctuating water level, which had dropped by more than a metre between the early 1960s and the late 1970s. The lake, being located on a rise of land, has a very small cachement area and so its level is very susceptible to variations in annual rainfall. The lake is also relatively shallow with a largely flat bottom, making even a small change in water level noticeable at the lakeshore. The shoreline had become disagreeably mucky as a result of the decline in water level. And an outlet stream draining the lake to the north ceased flowing in the early 1970s, increasing concerns of eutrophication and stagnation of the lake water. However, the lake had by the late 1990s risen again by some 60 cm from its lowest levels of the late 1970s. While welcome, this rise drowned many young trees along the water edge, particularly on the north shore which became clothed in dead saplings. Emergent marsh plants (notably Scirpus, Typha, and Phragmites) had also overtaken much shore line with the resubmergence of formerly dry lake bottom. The water level dropped again during the very dry year of 2000, but has since risen again, and had reached very high levels following the very wet summer of 2010 and snowy winter of 2010/2011 (about 200 cm above its lowest level in 1975). Some recreational facilities, such as the boat launch facility on the lake's north- east corner, have been rendered inaccessible by the high water levels, and very little visible beach sand remains at the Pickerel Point or Ministik swimming areas. The variable water level has also caused other recent changes to the lake. At the time of lowest water level in the late 1970s, the lake's largest island, Spruce Island, was connected by dry land to the mainland, and a large gravel bar in the lake's north basin was exposed. Now, however, the land corridor to Spruce Island is resubmerged, and Spruce Island is once again an island. The once-exposed gravel bar has similarly been resubmerged, becoming a hazard to boating and unfortunately extirpating the colony of common terns and herring gulls that bred there. These two species are no longer commonly seen on the lake now that their breeding site has drowned, but the recent rise in water level is to the apparent benefit of the lake's common loon, red-necked grebe, and beaver populations. Ducks are also thriving in the stretches of now-flooded shoreline. And fish catches have improved markedly since the low water days of the late 1970s. Hydrology Madge Lake's hydrology remains fairly isolated even at its current water level. However, a heavily beaver-dammed creek allows the slow drainage of its waters to the north. Water level control structures at the creek outlet provides some control over the lake's water level. Lake water eventually enters Bear Head Lake at the north-eastern corner of Duck Mountain Provincial Park. Bear Head Lake is then in turn drained by Bear Head Creek, which continues north-east, crossing the Manitoba boundary, to join the Swan River on its journey to Swan Lake. Madge Lake is therefore part of the Swan River drainage basin, rather than the watershed of the nearby Assiniboine River. The lake water is only very slightly eutrophic (and so can be described as mesotrophic), and is also moderately hard and alkaline, with a limestone-buffered pH of about 8.2. The water clarity in summer is limited by phytoplankton growth and wave-agitation of the calcareous clay bottom. A Secchi disk depth of as little as 1 metre is not uncommon after windy days. Water quality, however, is still considered to be good, and in fact, among the best in Saskatchewan's parks. Surrounding forest The forest immediately surrounding the lake was last burned over in the mid 1800s, and so is now well over 100 years old and approaching climax. White spruce and balsam fir are now the dominant tree species on the shores of the lake. The lakeshore population of paper birch and trembling aspen is in decline, and deciduous trees are now fairly inconspicuous except in isolated pockets. This is a fairly recent development, as the deciduous trees that sprouted after the fires only started dying off in numbers in the 1980s. Before this time, the lake shore forest was dominated by deciduous trees. Therefore, for much of the 20th century, Spruce Island (which had escaped the fires) had a conspicuous evergreen forest in contrast to the younger deciduous forest of the surrounding shore, and thus the island received its name. However, the aging of the lakeshore forest means Spruce Island's forest is no longer visually distinctive. Fish species Fish species include walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, burbot and white sucker.

Biosynthesis Rhizoxin is biosynthesised by Burkholderia rhizoxinica, a bacterial endosymbiont of the fungus Rhizopus microsporus. It is one of a large group of rhizoxin-like compounds produced by the bacteria. The bacterial endosymbiont can be grown independently in culture. This may allow easy harvesting of rhizoxin and the related compounds avoiding total chemical synthesis, although total chemical synthesis is possible. Cytotoxic function Rhizoxin binds beta tubulin in eukaryotic cells disrupting microtubule formation. This, in turn, prevents formation of the mitotic spindle inhibiting cell division. Additionally rhizoxin can depolymerise assembled microtubules. Erratum in J. Antibiot. (Tokyo)., 40 (4), following 565. (1987). The function of rhizoxin is similar to Vinca alkaloids. Rhizoxin has undergone clinical trials as an anti-cancer drug although it did not reach later stages of clinical trials due to low activity in vivo. Related compounds to rhizoxin may have improved biological activity. Structure Rhizoxin is a 16-membered lactone ring connected to an oxazole ring by a long unsaturated chain.

She was a daughter of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and Princess Augusta Wilhelmine of Hesse-Darmstadt. She married Crown Prince William of W√ºrttemberg, whom she divorced, and Emperor Francis I of Austria. First marriage On 8 June 1808, at Munich, Caroline Augusta married Crown Prince William (1781‚Äì1864) becoming Crown Princess of W√ºrttemberg. They had no children and were divorced on 31 August 1814. Her first marriage was arranged to avoid a political marriage arranged by Napoleon. After the marriage ceremony, her spouse said to her: We are victims to politics. She spent her time writing letters to her brother Louis, and learning Italian and English. The couple never bonded with each other and the marriage was finally annulled by Pope Pius VII to enable both of them to make remarriages that were valid in the Catholic Church. At the time of the annulment, it was claimed by them that they had lived separately in the palace and that the marriage had never been consummated. Second marriage After the annulment of her marriage, Caroline Augusta was considered as a bride for both the Emperor Francis II and his younger brother, Ferdinand. Later, Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany withdrew his proposal and Caroline Augusta became the Emperor's bride. On 29 October 1816, Caroline Augusta married Francis II, Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica She became the fourth wife of the emperor, who was 24 years older than her and had fathered thirteen children by two of his previous wives. The English diplomat Frederick Lamb called the new empress \\"ugly, clever and amiable,\\" and the emperor her husband had this to say of her: \\"She can stand a push, the other was nothing but air.\\"Frederick Lamb to his mother, 31 October 1816, in British Library, Add. MS. 45546, f. 156v. The wedding, and indeed their married life, was very simple due to the strict economy favoured by the Emperor. Prior to this marriage, Caroline Augusta had always been known as Charlotte, but now she began using the name Caroline. This marriage, which lasted until the emperor's death almost 20 years later, was harmonious but remained childless. She became popular in Austria and was active in social work; she founded several hospitals and residences for the poor. After the death of her spouse in 1835, she moved to Salzburg and lived there in quiet dignity until her own death nearly four decades later. The dowager empress died in February 1873, on the day after her 81st birthday. Like her husband Francis II, who was devoted to his family and exhorted his heir in his last testament to \\"Preserve unity in the family and regard it as one of the highest goods,\\" Caroline Augusta also was close to her relatives, especially her sister and niece who were also married into the imperial family. She was good friends with her half-sister, the Archduchess Sophie, who was married in 1824 to Caroline's step-son Archduke Franz Karl of Austria and would become the mother of two emperors, Franz Joseph of Austria- Hungary, and Maximilian of Mexico. She was also close to her half-niece, the Empress Elisabeth, who was Sophie's niece and daughter-in-law. A pearl brooch formerly owned by Caroline Augusta was auctioned at Sotheby's in 2012.

The ride The ride starts with a descent through a dark tunnel, which opens up into a broad section of rapids in which the rafts can even overtake one another. The rafts then pass two waterfalls. In some cases the rafts line up in such a way that unlucky visitors will get a quick shower from the very edge of the falls. After this the river narrows. The area between the waterfalls offers visitors a chance to watch the boats go by. After the waterfalls there is a narrow passage with another overpass. In hot summers there will be a water jet from the wall to ensure that the boats will be splashed. The rapids get more intense throughout the ride, until it passes the narrow pass. After this pass it will drift between two waterfalls which are literally two walls of water. After passing the last waterfall the ride ends with more intense rapids. From the exit a walk can be made around the ride, using Inca rope bridges. The ride is based on pre-Columbian cultures, whose styles can be found everywhere: * The whole building is covered with chibcha decorations * Square before the ride‚Äôs entrance: Chac-mool themed waste dispenser (Mayan/Toltec) * Ride entrance: two giant Teotihuacan warrior atlantes.

Their biggest hit \\"Burning Flame\\" charted in the UK and US, but their one other hit in the UK, \\"Every Time That I See You\\", did not chart in the US. Geoff Barradale now serves as manager for the Arctic Monkeys. History Vitamin Z founders Geoff Barradale and Nick Lockwood were born and raised in Sheffield. The group originally took shape around a loose-knit collection of local musicians who came together in a common rehearsal space. The band's debut album Rites of Passage, was released in 1985. Its most prominent single, \\"Burning Flame\\", produced by Chris Hughes, hit number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100, and the band toured England with Tears for Fears. Vitamin Z also made news when their video for the song \\"Circus Ring (We Scream About)\\" was filmed in Istanbul, making them the first Western Europeans to be allowed to film in Turkey since Midnight Express prompted government officials there to close the border to foreign film units. A year or so further on and the follow-up album was ready to go. \\"We sat down and listened to it and it didn't do anything\\", recalls Barradale. \\"If it didn't move us, it wasn't going to move anybody else. The songs were good, but the treatment was wrong, contrived, plastic. We see ourselves as far more edgy, spiky. It was the wrong marriage with a producer.\\" While they awaited the results of a lawsuit that would hopefully allow them to rework the songs, they wrote a number of new ones. They liked what they were hearing so much that they paid for another demo out of their own pockets. \\"We knew\\", says Barradale, \\"that this was our moment. We had to take it.\\" By the time the legal matters were settled, they were already in the studio working on Sharp Stone Rain, beginning with producer Pete Smith (Sting, The Adventures) but ended up co-producing tracks. Also seizing the moment, Lockwood decided to move from bass and keyboards to guitar. Barradale appeared on The Alan Parsons Project album Gaudi, released in 1987. He sang lead vocals for the \\"Standing on Higher Ground\\" lead off single. Vitamin Z recorded demos for a third album, which was never released. Barradale continued to record and perform from his native Sheffield, teaming up with guitarist Mick Bratby and bass player Ade Thorpe, both formerly of No Mean City and Aku Ake and later with guitarist and songwriter Alan Smyth, later a producer based at his own 2-Fly Studios in the city. Their bands Fruit, Seafruit, were championed by broadcaster Jeff Cooper's 'XS' show (now radio2XS) at the radio station Hallam FM, where they recorded two sessions in 1996 and 1997. Cooper also employed Barradale as the narrator of a 1995 radio documentary for the BBC Sheffield Music 1995, which also featured Pulp's Jarvis Cocker and others. Geoff Barradale is the manager for the Arctic Monkeys who are also from Sheffield.

It crosses beneath the locally famous \\"Alto de La L√≠nea\\" in the Cordillera Central or central range of the Andes mountains, easing traffic on one of Colombia's main east-west road connections (the National Route 40) which links Bogot√° with Cali and the Pacific port of Buenaventura. It is the longest road tunnel in Latin America, and in the Americas, well ahead of the Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel which is the longest road tunnel in North America. The total length of the tunnel is , its western entrance being at above msl, east of the city of Armenia and the eastern one at above msl, at west of Ibagu√©. Constructions of the pilot tunnel started on 30 September 2004 and both sides of the pilot met on 2 August 2008. In September 2007 Ministry of Transport launched the tender process for the construction of tunnel and connecting roads. Construction work started in December 2008 in head of Union Temporal Segundo Centenario led by Carlos Collins and was originally expected to finish in 2016. In May 2016, the opening was delayed to 2018. The tunnel was finally opened on 4 September 2020, after 14 years of construction work, at a total cost of around 2.9 trillion pesos (US$870 million). Benefits Trajectory of the planned tunnel. Some of the benefits include lower operation costs (US$37 million in the first year), shorter travel time and reduction in the number of accidents. Due to the difficult terrain that will be avoided, US$37 million should be saved in operating costs in the first year. Furthermore, travel time will decrease as average speed increases from its current to . For heavy vehicles, travel times can be decreased by 80 minutes, and 40 minutes for light vehicles. This section is also currently one of the stretches in the country most prone to accidents (four times the national average) due to its geography and climate. The tunnel could bring the accident rate down to the average. Total economic benefits are estimated to be US$40 million per annum.

He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia and eventually based himself in Squaw Valley, California, but due to an itinerant childhood he never identified with a single place and chose Boulder, Colorado, as the place he came from. It was from here that he started his professional skiing career after initially attending the University of Colorado Boulder before dropping out to pursue his dreams. Biography He won numerous awards and competitions. McConkey started as a competitive ski racer, but moved on to be featured in a long line of extreme skiing movies. McConkey was known for combining BASE jumping with skiing, as seen in such feats as skiing into a BASE jump off the Eiger. McConkey went to Burke Mountain Academy. He was also known for his contributions to ski design, notably being the father of reverse sidecut and reverse camber skis (aka: skis with rocker); first mounting bindings onto water skis for use in Alaska, then with the Volant Spatula and, more recently, the K2 Pontoon ski design. McConkey's high-speed chairlift and ski area at Park City Mountain Resort are named after his father, Jim McConkey, who was an early proponent of extreme skiing in the U.S. On April 2, 2011 Shane McConkey was inducted into the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Hall of fame along with other Tahoe skiers, Daron Rahlves and Glen Plake. Death On March 26, 2009, Shane McConkey died while executing a ski-BASE jump on the Sass Pordoi, a mountain in the Sella group, in the Italian Dolomites. One of his skis failed to release, sending him into a spin. After he corrected the problem, it was too late to deploy his parachute.

It was first founded by PJ 'Doc' Doherty and Paddy Leyden. The composition of the band was; PJ (Bass guitar), Paddy Leyden (Rhythm guitar), Audrey Gallagher (vocals), Neal Calderwood, (Lead guitar) and Joe Bates (drummer). After spending a few months playing small venues around Ireland, the band were signed by the Irish record label SON, and released their debut single \\"Wish You Were Dead\\" in late 1993. There was a great deal of interest surrounding this release and Scheer followed it with the \\"Psychobabble EP\\" in 1994. After eight years in the band, PJ made the decision to leave in order to pursue projects in the United States. Peter Fleming (who managed the band and was also a session player) assume the role of bass guitar in the remaining years. In April 1995, Scheer signed to the 4AD label and released the \\"Schism EP\\". In 1996 the band's debut album was ready for release, and this was preceded by the release of two singles: \\"She√†\\" and a revamped \\"Wish You Were Dead\\". Infliction was released in 1996 to critical acclaim. The recording of their second album began in 1997, but due to a contractual disagreement with 4AD, the release of the album was postponed indefinitely; the aptly titled ...And Finally appeared in mid-2000 on the band's own Schism Records label.

At the 2006 census, its population was 3,899, in 765 families. Laft is more than 2000 years old. It is located on Qeshm island in the Straits of Hormuz, to the south-west of Bandar Abbas. Description Laft is surrounded by Hara forests (mangroves). The most obvious architectural features of the houses is their variously-sized windbreaks (windtowers). The people of Laft constructed them for making the inner space of the building cool in summer. The buildings of Laft are constructed close to each other, with winding and narrow alleys. Golden wells Historical monuments in Laft include Naderi Castle, a square-shaped castle with four towers; two rounded dome-like reservoirs; a burial ground in which some of the inscriptions are dated to 1000 years ago; and the shrines of Seyed Hassan Mansor, Sheikh Tousi, and Sheikh AndarAbi. Behind the castle, in a crater, 366 Tala (Golden) wells were dug for gathering the rainwater, one for each day of the leap year in Iran. Some historians believe that these wells date from the time of the Achaemenian and Sassanian dynasties. At Laft harbor, there is a dock which is related to Median, Achaemenian, and Sassanian dynasties. This dock is about 130 m long and the main seabed thick of about 7 m. The walls at the dock are about 3 m that are made up bevelled stones. Near Laft a 220 kV-powerline crosses Ghesm strait. Sheikh AndarAbi Island Across from Laft and Khamir harbors, there is a very small island which is named Sheikh AndarAbi. Some parts of this small island are covered with water at high tide. The distance between Laft harbor and Sheikh AndarAbi Island can be covered by a speedboat in less than 5 minutes. At the north margin of Sheikh AndarAbi Island, the surface of the land is lower than other parts of the island and there are many Hara trees. At the southeast margin of the island there is a famous dome which is popular as the Shrine of Sheikh AndarAbi or Qadamgah-e Sheikh (footprint of the Sheikh). At high tide seawater covers the majority of the Island. Nowadays, nobody lives there, and fishermen and sailors are still respecting this island.

It is co-educational and in total has approximately 940 pupils, spread over two sites situated next to one another: the Prep School (catering for the two to eleven-year-old pupils); and the Senior School (catering for the School's eleven- to eighteen-year-old pupils).  History  Lingfield College was founded in 1940 by three members of the Roman Catholic School Sisters of Notre Dame as an all-girls school. They had arrived from Faversham, Kent with fourteen young evacuees and set up a school. The School originally occupied houses in Lingfield, before the purchase of Batnors Hall (the current site of the Prep School) and Ivy House (the current site of the Senior School), both on the edge of the village, and close by to Lingfield Racecourse. Ivy House was renamed Le Clerc House, after Alix Le Clerc, the founder of the sixteenth-century order from which the Sisters' congregation was descended. The School was expanded over both sites in the 1950s and 1960s; however by the early 1980s, a decline in vocations made the Sisters feel the need to focus their now more limited resources elsewhere in the world. They left Lingfield in 1986. The School's governance was turned over to a lay educational trust, after which boarding was discontinued and lay senior staff and a board of governors were appointed to replace the Sisters. In 1996 the school became fully co-educational, after the appointment of Nuala Shepley as Head Mistress in 1992. The 1990s and 2000s saw the rapid construction of further classrooms, Science laboratories, a Music/Drama block, Sports Hall, an Art/Technology block, and the development of further playing fields on former farmland adjacent to the Senior School. The old gymnasium was converted to a dining hall and kitchens, the School Library was enlarged, the Home Economics room was updated, and a new VI Form Centre was built to cater for the growing numbers of pupils. A new cricket pavilion and an Astroturf surface were built, and in 2008, the main Senior School building was refurbished, a separate dining room was created in the expanded VI Form Centre and the Fitness Suite at the Sports Hall was expanded. Likewise, the Prep School saw similar development with the building of a new Assembly Hall/Sports Hall, further classrooms, a Science laboratory, dining hall, and staff offices. The playground area was enlarged, the former dining room was converted into a hall with a Drama facility and Art Department, car parks were added, and the Nursery and Foundation Departments were refurbished and expanded. In 2005, the School Governors agreed to an enlarged intake at Year Nine (13+) which increased the total school roll to around 820 pupils by 2010. In Summer 2011, Nuala Shepley retired and Richard Bool (formerly of Ardingly College and Sherborne) was appointed as the new Head Master. Lingfield confirmed the opening of a new State-of-the-Art Sixth Form Centre for the 2014/15 academic year. This concluded a three-year design and construction project, the largest in the school's history. The new building encompasses a statement central atrium, 150-seater university-style lecture theatre, Apple media suite, careers suite, 6 specialist teaching rooms, modern common room, study zones and a coffee shop. Recently there has been a further Science Laboratory built and flood lights added to the Astroturf. The School also completed building a new Music Centre in 2017.  School System  The School is divided into two physical sites (located next to one another): the Prep School (location of pupils from Nursery to Year Six); and the Senior School (location of pupils Year Seven to Sixth Form). In the Prep School each year contains approximately forty pupils in two forms. In Years Seven and Eight, the year size is increased to approximately eighty pupils in four forms. There is a further intake at 13+ and the Sixth Form. It is usual for most pupils from the Prep School to continue to the Senior School. An entrance exam for 11+ and 13+ is held in January which is taken by outside students, with only the top-scoring selected to join the school. Academic, Art, Sport, Music and Drama scholarships, as well as bursaries are available. Pupils in the Senior School study English, Maths, Science, Geography, History, Philosophy and Religion, Drama, Music, Computer Science, French, and either Spanish or German (from Year Seven onwards). Over 160 extra-curricular clubs are offered, and sports afternoons are allocated to the various year groups. Fixtures are played against other independent and state schools on these afternoons and on Saturdays. = GCSE, iGCSE and A-Level = At GCSE or iGCSE (Year Ten and Eleven), most students normally take seven compulsory subjects: Maths, English Literature, English Language, Biology, Chemistry, Physics and one modern foreign language; and choose three further options from a choice of the following: Art, Computer Science, Drama, Economics, Geography, History, Music, a second foreign language, Media Studies, Philosophy and Religion, Physical Education (PE) and Home Economics. The School enters students for the new IGCSE qualification. Those considered good enough at Maths are offered the chance to take a further qualification. There are a 163 students in the Sixth Form: seventy six in the Lower Sixth (Year 12) and eighty seven in the Upper Sixth (Year 13). It is usual for sixth formers to take four subjects for AS level and to continue with three for A2 level, although there are some exceptions to this each year. In addition to the subjects taught at GCSE level, Further Maths, Media Studies, Business Studies, Photography and Psychology are offered at A-Level. = House System = Lingfield has four Houses; Bell, Yeates, Clubb and Higgins named after the parents that took the school from the Notre Dame Sisters. These were originally named after St Andrew, St Patrick, St David and St George. The pupils are assigned to a house to give a boarding school feel for the pupils and under the supervision of a member of staff acting as a head-of-house, the houses compete in sport, music and charitable fundraising events throughout the year. * Bell House * Yeates House * Clubb House * Higgins House  References   External links  *School website *ISI Report 2017 *Profile on the Independent Schools Council website *Overview on the Charities Commission website Category:Independent schools in Surrey Category:Educational institutions established in 1940 Category:1940 establishments in England Category:School Sisters of Notre Dame schools ","title":"Lingfield College"},{"id":"9876980","text":"Env is a viral gene that encodes the protein forming the viral envelope. The expression of the env gene enables retroviruses to target and attach to specific cell types, and to infiltrate the target cell membrane. Analysis of the structure and sequence of several different env genes suggests that Env proteins are type 1 fusion machines. Type 1 fusion machines initially bind a receptor on the target cell surface, which triggers a conformational change, allowing for binding of the fusion protein. The fusion peptide inserts itself in the host cell membrane and brings the host cell membrane very close to the viral membrane to facilitate membrane fusion. While there are significant differences in sequence of the env gene between retroviruses, the gene is always located downstream of gag, pro, and pol. The env mRNA must be spliced for expression. The mature product of the env gene is the viral spike protein, which has two main parts: the surface protein (SU) and the transmembrane protein (TM). The tropism of the virus is determined by the SU protein domain because it is responsible for the receptor-binding function of the virus. The SU domain therefore determines the specificity of the virus for a single receptor molecule.  Physical structure  = Oligomerization = The retroviral glycoproteins are oligomeric complexes that are composed of SU-TM heterodimers, which are made in the endoplasmic reticulum after the translation of the glycosylated Env precursor. The arrangement of these heterodimers determines the 3D structure of the knobbed spike on the viral surface. The Env proteins of the Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis virus (ASLV) and the Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) are both trimers of SU-TM heterodimers. The Env protein of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) also has a trimeric structure of heterodimers. It is believed that the intracellular transport of the nascent protein depends, to some extent, on the oligomerization of Env precursors, which allows hydrophobic sequences to be buried inside the protein structure. This oligomerization has also been implicated in fusion initiation with the membrane of the target cell. = Post-translational modification = Env can be modified by the addition of mannose-rich oligosaccharides, a process that takes place in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and is carried out by the enzymes of the host cell. Cotranslational glycosylation take place at the asparagine in the Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr motifs. Different retroviruses vary widely in N-linked glycosylation sites: HIV-1 can have as many as 30 sites glycosylated, 25 of which reside in gp120. At the other end of the spectrum, MMTV (Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus has only 4 sites for oligosaccharide addition (two on gp52 and two on gp37). The addition of oligosaccharides is believed to play a role in the proper folding of Env, presumably by stabilizing the protein structure. Without proper folding, protein transport and function can be severely compromised. The importance of glycosylation of Env in HIV-1 was ascertained by synthesizing the glycoprotein in the presence of a glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin. The synthesized protein was incorrectly folded and incapable of binding CD4. Receptor binding was only minimally affected, however, when the secreted env product was enzymatically deglycosylated.  In HIV  Diagram of HIV virion The env gene codes for the gp160 protein which forms a homotrimer, and is cleaved into gp120 and gp41 by the host cell protease, furin. To form an active fusion protein, SU gp120 and TM gp41 polypeptides remain non-covalently bound together, but this interaction is often not stable, leading to shed, soluble gp120 and membrane- bound, gp41 'stumps'. Separately, cleavage by furin is inefficient, and virions often are released with inactive, uncleaved gp160. Because of the high prevalence of these inactive forms, the immune system often produces antibodies which target inactive Env, rather than active forms of the envelope protein. See Replication cycle of HIV. Env expression is regulated by the gene product of rev. Experimental deletion of rev resulted in the inability to detect the Env protein and levels of env mRNA in the cell cytoplasm were significantly diminished. However, when total cellular RNA was analyzed, env RNA totals were not significantly difference in the presence and absence of rev coexpression. It was found that without rev expression, there was a marked increase in nuclear env RNA, which suggests that rev plays an important role in the nuclear export of env mRNA. The role of rev was further elucidated when it was found that Rev acts in trans to target a specific sequence present in the env gene of HIV-1 to initiate export of incompletely spliced HIV-1 RNA from the nucleus. =gp120= Exposed on the surface of the viral envelope, the glycoprotein gp120 binds to the CD4 receptor on any target cell that has such a receptor, particularly the helper T-cell. Strains of HIV-1 have been isolated that are able to enter host cells that are CD4 negative. This CD4-independence is associated with spontaneous mutation in the env gene. The presence of a co-receptor, CXCR4, is sufficient for this mutant strain to infect human cells. The strain with this phenotype was found to have seven mutations in the sequence coding for gp120 and it is proposed that these mutations induce conformational changes in gp120 that allow the virus to directly interact with the co-receptor. Since CD4 receptor binding is the most obvious step in HIV infection, gp120 was among the first targets of HIV vaccine research. These efforts have been hampered by the fusion mechanism used by HIV, which makes neutralization by antibodies extremely difficult. Prior to binding the host cell, gp120 remains effectively hidden from antibodies because it is buried in the protein and shielded by sugars. Gp120 is only exposed when in close proximity to a host cell and the space between the viral and host cell membranes is small enough to sterically hinder the binding of antibodies. =gp41= The glycoprotein gp41 is non-covalently bound to gp120, and provides the second step by which HIV enters the cell. It is originally buried within the viral envelope, but when gp120 binds to a CD4 receptor, gp120 changes its conformation causing gp41 to become exposed, where it can assist in fusion with the host cell. Fusion inhibitor drugs such as enfuvirtide block the fusion process by binding to gp41.  Env in MMTV  The Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) env gene codes for a polyprotein gp70 () that is cleaved to yield the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) Env products. Gp52 is the SU subunit in MMTV and gp36 is the TM subunit. Gp52 is a 52,000-dalton glycoprotein and gp36 is a 36,000-dalton glycoprotein. MMTV Env is of particular interest to researchers because of the discovery that it encodes an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) that has been shown to transform human and murine mammary cell in culture. This ITAM depolarizes epithelial acinar structures, thereby changing the phenotype of the cells and causing them to become cancerous.  Env in ASLV  = Subgroup A = Avian Sarcoma and Leukosis Viruses (ASLV) have ten subgroups (A through J). The envelope glycoprotein of subgroup A is called EnvA and its env gene codes for precursor protein known as Pr95. This precursor is cleaved by host cell enzymes to yield the surface protein subunit, gp85, and the transmembrane protein subunit, gp37, which heterodimerize and then form a trimer. The virus cannot infect cells before the processing of the envelope precursor protein is completed. For the virus to penetrate the cytosol of a host cell, a low pH is necessary.  Env in MLV  The env gene of Murine Leukemia Virus (MLV) codes for the 71,000-dalton glycoprotein, gp71. This membrane receptor was isolated from Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV).  Env in mammalian evolution  The retroviral protein env has been captured multiple times during mammalian evolution and is expressed in placental tissue, where it facilitates fusion of fetal and maternal cells. The protein is called syncytin in mammals.Nova. 2016. Endogenous retroviruses.

Havens opened his set at the Woodstock Music and Art Fair (\\"Woodstock\\") with \\"From The Prison\\" . Havens was the opening act at Woodstock, thus Merrick's song has the distinction of being the first song sung at Woodstock. Subsequently, Merrick went on to record an album of original compositions for Mercury Records, released in 1969. Following this he moved his family away from New York City and teamed up briefly with fellow Mercury artist Kenny Rankin to appear on The Tonight Show, and open for Flip Wilson in various venues throughout the US. However, a decision to focus on his growing family eventually led him to withdraw from the music industry. Meanwhile, his song \\"Guess I'll Pack My Things,\\" had been recorded by Tom Ghent on his self-titled debut for Bill Cosby's Tetragrammaton Records. Apparently, this led to the song (and arrangement) being included by B.J. Thomas on his 1970 Scepter album, Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head. Jerry Jeff Walker later recorded Merrick's \\"The Stranger (He Was The Kind)\\" on his double album \\"A Man Must Carry On.\\" It served as an introduction and conclusion in his tribute to beloved Texas poet Hondo Crouch.

His parents were Boldi≈æar Habdeliƒá and Margarita Kraljiƒá. He went to gymnasium in Zagreb, studied philosophy in Graz and theology in Trnava. He worked as a teacher in Rijeka, Vara≈ædin and Zagreb where he became the rector of Jesuit Collegium and manager of Seminary. During his rectorship, the gymnasium was attended by Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá who will, in his own way, continue the Habdeliƒá's linguistic work, but on different foundations than those taught by the Jesuit gymnasium. Cover of Habdeliƒá's 1674 book Pervi otca na≈°ega Adama greh Although Habdeliƒá's prose does not really fit the modern definition of literature, his work is nevertheless powerful and fresh, especially in richness of the language he uses. His are the works of moral-didactic issues, the first of which was Zrcalo Marijansko (Mirror of Saint Mary) published in Graz in 1662. Dictionar, first edition from 1670 Christian morals is the main theme of Habdeliƒá's literary work, but because a man is prone in violating these strict Christian norms and easily gives himself to sin, this is Habdeliƒá's main literary preoccupation. His book intended for public uses, Prvi otca na≈°eg Adama greh (First sin of our father Adam), published by Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, had 1200 pages, and is a picture of man's fall and his tendency to sin. What is especially important is the ability of Habdeliƒá to analyze through that main theme all parts of society: nobles, citizens, peasants, and he doesn't spare the clergy either. Writing about the actual events in Croatia at that time (Zrinski-Frankopan conspiracy or Croatian and Slovenian peasant revolt led by Matija Gubec) he reveals himself as an upholder of the existing order. He considers the peasant rebellion as \\"volatility of the common people\\" and their tendency to chaotic behaviour, and the conspiracy as \\"arrogance of grand nobility\\". Habdeliƒá wrote in Kajkavian dialect and showed himself as an expert in the speech of commoners. At the same time he was opponent of common, profane things in which he also included folk songs, instructing his readers to discard \\"shameful, ungodly and impure songs\\". With his work Dictionar ili reƒçi slovenske (Dictionary or Slavic words) from 1670, he takes prominent, although layman, place in history of Croatian literature and linguistics. Namely, being without any special linguistic knowledge and writing for school papers he wrote Croatian-Latin dictionary. His total work is a mirror of Christian devotion with numerous examples from Jesuit and other religious literature but also a panoramic picture of Croatia in his time.

His military career began in 1876, at the battle of ‚ÄúHatogrande‚Äù, the conservative revolt against President Aquileo Parra. Later, Gonz√°lez Valencia, during the liberal revolt against President Miguel Antonio Caro, in 1895, once again he enlists in the national army to fight for his conservative beliefs. He repeated this same action during the civil war of ‚Äúthe Thousand Days‚Äù. Throughout his military career he was highly regarded for his courageous and compassionate attitude. He was ascended to the rank of General of the Army. Gonz√°lez Valencia also held the offices of ‚ÄúJefe Civil y Militar‚Äù (Military Governor) of Santander Department and Minister of War during the administration of President Jos√© Manuel Marroqu√≠n, in 1901.  The Presidency  Gonz√°lez Valencia, in 1904, was chosen by the Colombian Conservative Party to be the running mate of Rafael Reyes as his vice-president. The Colombian Liberal Party abstained from participating in the presidential election of this year, and both Reyes and Gonz√°lez Valencia won the election. Nevertheless, and soon after the election, their ideological differences became apparent. Gonz√°lez Valencia was a right wing conservative and Reyes was a moderate.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 156, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 General Reyes, who was politically more ambitious than General Gonz√°lez Valencia, could not forget the events of July 31, 1900, when Vice-President Jos√© Manuel Marroqu√≠n, with the aid of the military and the conservative party, had removed for m office President Manuel Antonio Sanclemente. Because President Rafael Reyes had opened the doors to a dialogue with the liberals, this made the conservatives very suspicious. Because General Gonz√°lez Valencia was highly appreciated by both, the Army and the conservative party, this made General Reyes very uncomfortable. Thus, General Reyes had to contrive a plan to remove General Gonz√°lez Valencia from the vice-presidency. He requested the intervention of two common friends of him and General Gonz√°lez, the Ambassador of the Vatican City State, Nuncio Apost√≥lico Monsignor Francisco Ragonessi and Don Luis Mart√≠nez Silva, to whom he expressed his concerns and intentions. General Reyes asked them to please communicate, in the best possible manner, to General Gonz√°lez his decision. Therefore, Monsignor Francisco Ragonessi and Mart√≠nez Silva contacted General Gonz√°lez Valencia, who was in C√∫cuta. They conveyed the message and explained to him that General Reyes would very much appreciate his ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù resignation to the office he had been elected to. All three agreed to meet in Duitama, an equidistant point between Bogot√° and C√∫cuta. On March 9, 1905, they met, as agreed, and General Gonz√°lez Valencia submitted his resignation. General Gonz√°lez Valencia served as Vice President under Rafael Reyes, who because of personal and professional differences, fired him and abolished the office of the vice presidency. It was not until the enactment of the Colombian Constitution of 1991 that the vice-presidency was reinstated again. He also served as Interim President of Colombia from August 3, 1909 to August 7, 1910. General Gonz√°lez Valencia, in his letter of resignation, addressed to the nation and not to General Reyes, said: ‚ÄúIn the best interest of the country and for the high ideals of the party, I resign today voluntarily, before the nation that honored and trusted me with this high office, because of the incompatibilities between the President and the Vice-President‚Äù. The resignation was obviously not voluntarily, in light of the demands of the ‚Äúdictador de facto‚Äù. The liberal party manifested great appreciation to Monsignor Ragonessi for his valuable service in furtherance of the peace process in the nation. The political tide and public opinion changed in disfavor of General Reyes. He resigned as President and handed over the office to President Interim Jorge Holgu√≠n. General Reyes, on his way out of the country, met with General Gonz√°lez Valencia in the port of Gamarra and asked him to retake his office of Vice-President. General Reyes declined his offer, for obvious reasons. Nevertheless, once that General Reyes had left the country, Congress convened on July 20, 1909, and elected General Gonz√°lez Valencia as president of Colombia. General Gonz√°lez Valencia was inaugurated on August 3, 1909, and was to serve until August 6, 1910.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 157, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 References External links *Partido Conservador Colombiano; Ram√≥n Gonz√°lez Valencia Category:1851 births Category:1928 deaths Category:People from Norte de Santander Department Category:Colombian people of Spanish descent Category:Colombian Conservative Party politicians Category:Presidents of Colombia Category:Vice Presidents of Colombia Category:Colombian generals ","title":"Ram√≥n Gonz√°lez Valencia"},{"id":"9877188","title":"1992 Alpine Skiing World Cup ‚Äì Men's Super G"},{"id":"9877201","text":"Virachola isocrates is a species of lycaenid or blue butterfly found in Asia.

It stars Frank Merrill as Tarzan, Natalie Kingston as Jane, and Al Ferguson. It was written by Ian McClosky Heath and directed by Henry MacRae. It was considered lost at one time but a copy has since been found. Today the serial is available on DVD and, in the public domain, available for download on the internet. Synopsis Lord Greystoke (Tarzan) returns to Africa, with Lady Jane and friend Albert Werper, in order to return to Opar. He needs the treasure of Opar in order to secure his estates in England. Werper, however, is actually interested in the gold himself. He is in league with Arab slave trader Achmet Zek who wishes revenge on Tarzan and Lady Jane for himself. Cast *Frank Merrill as \\"The Lord of the Manor‚Äîknown to London as the Earl of Greystoke‚Äîand to the Jungle as Tarzan, the Tiger!\\" Frank Merrill reprised his role as Tarzan from Tarzan the Mighty. His performance in these two serials makes him the last silent Tarzan and the first sound Tarzan. Merrill did his own stunts and devised the original Tarzan Yell. *Natalie Kingston as \\"Lady Jane, his wife, who has left the gaiety of London Society to share his life on the Jungle plantation\\" Natalie Kingston was again cast as the love interest but this time played the traditional character of Lady Jane instead of Mary Trevor (from Tarzan the Mighty). The change was not explained in the serial. *Al Ferguson as \\"Albert Werper, Soldier of Fortune‚Äîa guest at Greystoke Manor in the guise of a friendly Scientist\\" Al Ferguson was also again cast as the villain of the story but not the same character (or even a slightly renamed character, as with Jane. In Tarzan the Mighty he played the pirate Black John). *Kithnou as \\"The High Priestess of the Sun Worshipers‚ÄîLa, who has sworn that she will have no other mate than Tarzan\\" Mademoiselle Kithnou was a dancer and actress of mixed Indian and European descent from Puducherry, at that time in French India, or possibly from Mauritius.International Motion Picture Almanac, published by Quigley Pub. Co., 2004Gertner, Richard; International Motion Picture Almanac, published by Quigley Pub. Co., 1936 *Sheldon Lewis as \\"Achmet Zek, a Nomad Chief, against whose traffic in slaves Tarzan has waged relentless war\\" Quoted text from the opening credits for each character.

Advertising for the serial, in addition to the usual jungle serial perils (such as elephants, lions, tigers and gorillas), focused on the beautiful women (Lady Jane, La, and the women of the slave market scenes). Kingston, as Jane, appeared topless in a swimming sequence in chapter 8. \\"It is said that fathers sometimes accompanied their sons to the showings.\\" A further sequel, to create a trilogy of Frank Merrill Tarzan serials, was planned. The third entry would have been called Tarzan the Terrible. However, Merrill's voice was deemed unsuitable for sound films and the sequel was cancelled. Merrill made personal appearances in costume to promote the serial. During these, he realised how much influence he had on children. Combined with the issues over his voice this led him to retire after this serial and devote his life to children. He became a Recreational Director for the Parks commission of the Los Angeles city administration. Tarzan the Tiger was a transitional film with one version released as a silent and the other with a partial soundtrack. The soundtrack consists mostly of only music and sound effects, but does include the first Tarzan yell, although it does not sound like the now-traditional call that was first used in the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movie Tarzan the Ape Man.

Condon, 286 U.S. 73 (1932), was a voting rights case decided by the United States Supreme Court, which found the all-white Democratic Party primary in Texas unconstitutional. This was one of four cases brought to challenge the Texas all-white Democratic Party primary. All challenges were supported by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Jim Crow Supreme Court Cases: Texas, accessed 21 March 2008 With Smith v. Allwright (1944) the Supreme Court decisively prohibited the white primary. Background In Nixon v. Herndon (1927), the Court had struck down a Texas statute that prohibited blacks from participating in the Texas Democratic primary election. Very shortly after that decision, the Texas Legislature repealed the invalidated statute, declared that the effect of the Nixon decision was to create an emergency requiring immediate action, and replaced the old statute with a new one. The new law provided that every political party would henceforth \\"in its own way determine who shall be qualified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party\\". Under the authority of this law, the executive committee of the Texas Democratic Party adopted a resolution stating that \\"all white democrats who are qualified under the constitution and laws of Texas\\" would be allowed to vote. In the 1928 Democratic primary, Dr. L. A. Nixon of El Paso again tried to vote. He was again denied, on the ground that the resolution allowed only whites to vote (Nixon was black). Nixon sued the judges of elections in federal court. Issue The defendants argued that there was no state action and therefore no equal protection violation, because the Democratic Party was \\"merely a voluntary association\\" that had the power to choose its own membership. Decision The Court, however, in a five to four ruling, reasoned that because the Texas statute gave the party's executive committee the authority to exclude would-be members of the party - an authority, the Court said, that the executive committee hitherto had not possessed - the executive committee was acting under a state grant of power. Because there was state action, the case was controlled by Nixon v. Herndon (1927), which prohibited state officials from \\"discharg[ing] their official functions in such a way as to discriminate invidiously between white citizens and black\\". Aftermath The Court's decision affected all-white primaries in other Southern states. The Democratic Party in Texas responded by barring blacks from participation in the party nominating conventions, and thus effectively continuing the white primary. Grovey v. Townsend (1935) and Smith v. Allwright (1944) were additional cases brought by African Americans to challenge Texas white primaries. With the latter, the Supreme Court decisively prohibited white primaries.

They were initially developed as the second-stage motor of the Scout rocket. The design was based on the MGM-29 Sergeant, a surface-to-surface missile developed for the United States Army at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  Versions  = Flown versions =  Castor 1  :The Castor 1 was first used for a successful suborbital launch of a Scout X-1 rocket on September 2, 1960. :It was long, in diameter, and had a burn time of 27 seconds. Castor 1 stages were also used as strap-on boosters for launch vehicles using Thor first stages, including the Delta-D. (A Delta-D was used in 1964 to launch Syncom-3, the first satellite placed in a geostationary orbit.) Castor 1 stages were used in 141 launch attempts of Scout and Delta rockets, only 2 of which were failures. They were also used on some thrust- assisted Thor-Agena launchers. The last launch using a Castor 1 was in 1971.  Castor 2  :The Castor 2 was an upgraded version of the Castor 1. It was first used on a Scout in 1965, and continued to be used on Scouts until the last Scout launch, in 1994. Castor 2 stages were also used as the strap-on boosters for the Delta-E, and for the Japanese-built N-I, N-II and H-I rockets. It retained the same diameter as the Castor 1, and was from 5.96 m to 6.27 m in length.  Castor 4  :The Castor 4, along with its A and B variants, were expanded to 1.02 m in diameter. They were used as strap-ons on some Delta, Delta II, Atlas IIAS, and Athena launch vehicles. They were also planned to serve as the first stage of the Spanish Capricornio booster, however, no such flights occurred before the project was cancelled. :Castor 4B is used in the European Maxus Programme, with launches from Esrange in Sweden. : Certain versions of the H-IIA rockets flown by JAXA used either two or four strap-on boosters developed and produced by Alliant Techsystems. These boosters use motors which are modified versions of the Castor 4A-XL motor design. These motors are 38 feet long and approximately 40 inches in diameter.  Castor 30  : The CASTOR 30 motor is based on the CASTOR 120 motor, which has flown on the Taurus I, Athena I and Athena II launch vehicles. The inaugural flight of the new motor occurred in April 2013 as the second stage on the Orbital Sciences Antares medium-lift rocket for International Space Station resupply missions. : The CASTOR 30 upper stage measures in length and in diameter, and it weighs . The motor is nominally designed as an upper stage that can function as a second or third stage as well, depending on the vehicle configuration. : The CASTOR 30XL solid rocket motor measures in length and in diameter, and it weighs approximately . The nozzle is eight feet long with a submerged design with a high performance expansion ratio (56:1) and a dual density exit cone. Taurus XL rocket  Castor 120  :An unrelated development to the earlier Castor 1, 2 and 4, the Castor 120 is a derivative of the first-stage motor of the MX (\\"Peacekeeper\\") missile. \\"120\\" refers to the planned weight, in thousands of pounds, of the booster at project inception. The actual product turned out lighter than this, however. It was first used as the first-stage motor of Lockheed Martin's Athena I, and later the first and second stages of Athena II. After a test launch in August 1995, the first launch of a customer payload took place on August 22, 1997, when an Athena was used to launch the NASA Lewis satellite. In 2006 Orbital Sciences Corporation agreed to pay $17.5 million for the Castor 120 motors used in the Taurus XL launch vehicles for the Orbiting Carbon Observatory and Glory satellites. The main solid rocket boosters (SRB-A) of the Japanese H-IIA launch vehicle are based on the Castor 120, and were jointly designed by ATK and IHI Aerospace. = Proposed versions - based on Space Shuttle SRB = Instead of using a D6AC steel case and PBAN binder like the Space Shuttle SRB, these will use the technology derived from the GEM motors which have carbon composite cases and HTPB binder.http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/organizations/nasa/one-on-one-with- atks-charlie-precourt-about-composite-materials-and-nasas-space-launch-system/ The carbon composite design eliminates the factory joint common on all Space Shuttle SRBs.

While the term skew lattice can be used to refer to any non-commutative generalization of a lattice, since 1989 it has been used primarily as follows. Definition A skew lattice is a set S equipped with two associative, idempotent binary operations \\\\wedge and \\\\vee, called meet and join, that validate the following dual pair of absorption laws x\\\\wedge (x\\\\vee y) = x = (y\\\\vee x)\\\\wedge x , x\\\\vee (x\\\\wedge y) = x = (y\\\\wedge x)\\\\vee x . Given that \\\\vee and \\\\wedge are associative and idempotent, these identities are equivalent to validating the following dual pair of statements: x\\\\vee y= x if x\\\\wedge y=y, x\\\\wedge y=x if x\\\\vee y=y.Leech, J, Skew lattices in rings, Algebra Universalis, 26(1989), 48-72. Historical background For over 60 years, noncommutative variations of lattices have been studied with differing motivations. For some the motivation has been an interest in the conceptual boundaries of lattice theory; for others it was a search for noncommutative forms of logic and Boolean algebra; and for others it has been the behavior of idempotents in rings. A noncommutative lattice, generally speaking, is an algebra (S; \\\\wedge, \\\\vee) where \\\\wedge and \\\\vee are associative, idempotent binary operations connected by absorption identities guaranteeing that \\\\wedge in some way dualizes \\\\vee . The precise identities chosen depends upon the underlying motivation, with differing choices producing distinct varieties of algebras. Pascual Jordan, motivated by questions in quantum logic, initiated a study of noncommutative lattices in his 1949 paper, √úber Nichtkommutative Verb√§nde,Jordan, P. Uber Nichtkommutative Verb√§nde, Arch. Math. 2 (1949), 56‚Äì59. choosing the absorption identities x\\\\wedge (y\\\\vee x) = x = (x\\\\wedge y)\\\\vee x. He referred to those algebras satisfying them as Schr√§gverb√§nde. By varying or augmenting these identities, Jordan and others obtained a number of varieties of noncommutative lattices. Beginning with Jonathan Leech's 1989 paper, Skew lattices in rings,Leech, J, Skew lattices in rings, Algebra Universalis, 26(1989), 48-72 skew lattices as defined above have been the primary objects of study. This was aided by previous results about bands. This was especially the case for many of the basic properties. Basic properties Natural partial order and natural quasiorder In a skew lattice S, the natural partial order is defined by y\\\\leq x if x \\\\wedge y = y = y \\\\wedge x, or dually, x \\\\vee y = x = y \\\\vee x. The natural preorder on S is given by y \\\\preceq x if y \\\\wedge x\\\\wedge y = y or dually x \\\\vee y \\\\vee x = x. While \\\\leq and \\\\preceq agree on lattices, \\\\leq properly refines \\\\preceq in the noncommutative case. The induced natural equivalence D is defined by xDy if x \\\\preceq y \\\\preceq x, that is, x \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge x = x and y \\\\wedge x \\\\wedge y = y or dually, x \\\\vee y \\\\vee x = x and y \\\\vee x \\\\vee y = y. The blocks of the partition S/D are lattice ordered by A > B if a \\\\in A and b \\\\in B exist such that a > b. This permits us to draw Hasse diagrams of skew lattices such as the following pair: File:Skew diag.png E.g., in the diagram on the left above, that a and b are D related is expressed by the dashed segment. The slanted lines reveal the natural partial order between elements of the distinct D-classes. The elements 1, c and 0 form the singleton D-classes. Rectangular Skew Lattices Skew lattices consisting of a single D-class are called rectangular. They are characterized by the equivalent identities: x \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge x = x, y \\\\vee x \\\\vee y = y and x \\\\vee y = y \\\\wedge x. Rectangular skew lattices are isomorphic to skew lattices having the following construction (and conversely): given nonempty sets L and R, on L \\\\times R define (x, y) \\\\vee (z , w ) = (z , y) and (x, y) \\\\wedge (z , w ) = (x, w ). The D-class partition of a skew lattice S, as indicated in the above diagrams, is the unique partition of S into its maximal rectangular subalgebras, Moreover, D is a congruence with the induced quotient algebra S/ D being the maximal lattice image of S , thus making every skew lattice S a lattice of rectangular subalgebras. This is the Clifford‚ÄìMcLean Theorem for skew lattices, first given for bands separately by Clifford and McLean. It is also known as the First Decomposition Theorem for skew lattices. Right (left) handed skew lattices and the Kimura factorization A skew lattice is right-handed if it satisfies the identity x\\\\wedge y \\\\wedge x = y \\\\wedge x or dually, x \\\\vee y \\\\vee x = x \\\\vee y. These identities essentially assert that x \\\\wedge y = y and x \\\\vee y = x in each D-class. Every skew lattice S has a unique maximal right-handed image S/ L where the congruence L is defined by xLy if both x \\\\wedge y = x and y \\\\wedge x = y (or dually, x \\\\vee y = y and y \\\\vee x = x). Likewise a skew lattice is left-handed if x \\\\wedge y = x and x \\\\vee y = y in each D-class. Again the maximal left- handed image of a skew lattice S is the image S/ R where the congruence R is defined in dual fashion to L. Many examples of skew lattices are either right or left-handed. In the lattice of congruences, R \\\\vee L = D and R \\\\cap L is the identity congruence \\\\Delta . The induced epimorphism S\\\\rightarrow S/D factors through both induced epimorphisms S \\\\rightarrow S/L and S \\\\rightarrow S/R. Setting T = S/D, the homomorphism k : S \\\\rightarrow S/L \\\\times S/R defined by k(x) = (L_x, R_x), induces an isomorphism k* : S\\\\sim S/ L \\\\times _T S/R. This is the Kimura factorization of S into a fibred product of its maximal right and left-handed images. File:Skew pullback.png Like the Clifford‚ÄìMcLean Theorem, Kimura factorization (or the Second Decomposition Theorem for skew lattices) was first given for regular bands (that satisfy the middle absorption identity, xyxzx = xyzx ). Indeed, both \\\\wedge and \\\\vee are regular band operations. The above symbols D, R and L come, of course, from basic semigroup theory.Leech, J, Recent developments in the theory of skew lattices, Semigroup Forum, 52(1996), 7-24.Leech, J, Magic squares, finite planes and simple quasilattices, Ars Combinatoria 77(2005), 75-96.Leech, J, The geometry of skew lattices, Semigroup Forum, 52(1993), 7-24.Leech, J, Normal skew lattices, Semigroup Forum, 44(1992), 1-8.Cvetko-Vah, K, Internal decompositions of skew lattices, Communications in Algebra, 35 (2007), 243-247Cvetko-Vah, K, A new proof of Spinks‚Äô Theorem, Semigroup Forum 73 (2006), 267-272.Laslo, G and Leech, J, Green‚Äôs relations on noncommutative lattices, Acta Sci. Math. (Szeged), 68 (2002), 501-533. Subvarieties of skew lattices Skew lattices form a variety. Rectangular skew lattices, left- handed and right-handed skew lattices all form subvarieties that are central to the basic structure theory of skew lattices. Here are several more. Symmetric Skew Lattices A skew lattice S is symmetric if for any x, y \\\\in S , x \\\\wedge y = y \\\\wedge x if x \\\\vee y = y \\\\vee x. Occurrences of commutation are thus unambiguous for such skew lattices, with subsets of pairwise commuting elements generating commutative subalgebras, i.e., sublattices. (This is not true for skew lattices in general.) Equational bases for this subvariety, first given by SpinksSpinks, M, Automated deduction in non-commutative lattice theory, Tech. Report 3/98, Monash U, GSCIT, 1998 are: x \\\\vee y \\\\vee (x \\\\wedge y) = (y \\\\wedge x) \\\\vee y \\\\vee x and x \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge (x \\\\vee y) = (y \\\\vee x) \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge x. A lattice section of a skew lattice S is a sublattice T of S meeting each D-class of S at a single element. T is thus an internal copy of the lattice S/ D with the composition T \\\\subset S \\\\rightarrow S/D being an isomorphism. All symmetric skew lattices for which S/D \\\\leq \\\\aleph_0, admit a lattice section. Symmetric or not, having a lattice section T guarantees that S also has internal copies of S/ L and S/ R given respectively by T [R] = \\\\bigcup_{t\\\\in T} R_t and T [L] = \\\\bigcup_{t\\\\in T} L_t, where R_t and Lt are the R and L congruence classes of t in T . Thus T [ R] \\\\subset S \\\\rightarrow S/L and T [L] \\\\subset S \\\\rightarrow S/R are isomorphisms. This leads to a commuting diagram of embedding dualizing the preceding Kimura diagram. File:Skew lsection.png Cancellative Skew Lattices A skew lattice is cancellative if x \\\\vee y = x \\\\vee z and x \\\\wedge y = x \\\\wedge z implies y = z and likewise x \\\\vee z = y \\\\vee z and x \\\\wedge z = y \\\\wedge z implies x = y. Cancellatice skew lattices are symmetric and can be shown to form a variety. Unlike lattices, they need not be distributive, and conversely. Distributive Skew Lattices Distributive skew lattices are determined by the identities: x \\\\wedge (y \\\\vee z ) \\\\wedge x = (x \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge x) \\\\vee (x \\\\wedge z \\\\wedge x) (D1) x \\\\vee (y \\\\wedge z ) \\\\vee x = (x \\\\vee y \\\\vee x) \\\\wedge (x \\\\vee z \\\\vee x). (D'1) Unlike lattices, (D1) and (D'1) are not equivalent in general for skew lattices, but they are for symmetric skew lattices.Spinks, M, Automated deduction in non-commutative lattice theory, Tech. Report 3/98, Monash University, Gippsland School of Computing and Information Technology, June 1998 The condition (D1) can be strengthened to x \\\\wedge (y \\\\vee z ) \\\\wedge w = (x \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge w) \\\\vee (x \\\\wedge z \\\\wedge w) (D2) in which case (D'1) is a consequence. A skew lattice S satisfies both (D2) and its dual, x \\\\vee (y \\\\wedge z ) \\\\vee w = (x \\\\vee y \\\\vee w) \\\\wedge (x \\\\vee z \\\\vee w), if and only if it factors as the product of a distributive lattice and a rectangular skew lattice. In this latter case (D2) can be strengthened to x \\\\wedge (y \\\\vee z ) = (x \\\\wedge y) \\\\vee (x \\\\wedge z ) and (y \\\\vee z ) \\\\wedge w = (y \\\\wedge w) \\\\vee (z \\\\wedge w). (D3) On its own, (D3) is equivalent to (D2) when symmetry is added. We thus have six subvarieties of skew lattices determined respectively by (D1), (D2), (D3) and their duals. Normal Skew Lattices As seen above, \\\\wedge and \\\\vee satisfy the identity xyxzx = xyzx. Bands satisfying the stronger identity, xyzx = xzyx, are called normal. A skew lattice is normal skew if it satisfies x \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge z \\\\wedge x = x \\\\wedge z \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge x. (N) For each element a in a normal skew lattice S, the set a \\\\wedge S \\\\wedge a defined by { a \\\\wedge x \\\\wedge a  x \\\\in S } or equivalently { x \\\\in S  x\\\\leq a } is a sublattice of S, and conversely. (Thus normal skew lattices have also been called local lattices.) When both \\\\wedge and \\\\vee are normal, S splits isomorphically into a product T \\\\times D of a lattice T and a rectangular skew lattice D, and conversely. Thus both normal skew lattices and split skew lattices form varieties. Returning to distribution, (D2) = (D1) + (N) so that (D2) characterizes the variety of distributive, normal skew lattices, and (D3) characterizes the variety of symmetric, distributive, normal skew lattices. Categorical Skew Lattices A skew lattice is categorical if nonempty composites of coset bijections are coset bijections. Categorical skew lattices form a variety. Skew lattices in rings and normal skew lattices are examples of algebras on this variety. Let a > b > c with a \\\\in A, b \\\\in B and c \\\\in C, \\\\varphi be the coset bijection from A to B taking a to b, \\\\psi be the coset bijection from B to C taking b to c and finally \\\\chi be the coset bijection from A to C taking a to c. A skew lattice S is categorical if one always has the equality \\\\psi \\\\circ \\\\varphi = \\\\chi, i.e. , if the composite partial bijection \\\\psi \\\\circ \\\\varphi if nonempty is a coset bijection from a C -coset of A to an A-coset of C . That is (A \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge A) \\\\cap (C \\\\vee b \\\\vee C ) = (C \\\\vee a \\\\vee C ) \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge (C \\\\vee a \\\\vee C ) = (A \\\\wedge c \\\\wedge A) \\\\vee b \\\\vee (A \\\\wedge c \\\\wedge A). All distributive skew lattices are categorical. Though symmetric skew lattices might not be. In a sense they reveal the independence between the properties of symmetry and distributivity.Spinks, M, On middle distributivity for skew lattices, Semigroup Forum 61 (2000), 341-345.Cvetko-Vah, Karin ; Kinyon, M. ; Leech, J. ; Spinks, M. Cancellation in skew Lattices. Order 28 (2011), 9-32. Skew Boolean algebras A zero element in a skew lattice S is an element 0 of S such that for all x \\\\in S, 0 \\\\wedge x = 0 = x \\\\wedge 0 or, dually, 0 \\\\vee x = x = x \\\\vee 0. (0) A Boolean skew lattice is a symmetric, distributive normal skew lattice with 0, (S ; \\\\vee, \\\\wedge, 0), such that a \\\\wedge S \\\\wedge a is a Boolean lattice for each a \\\\in S. Given such skew lattice S, a difference operator \\\\ is defined by x\\\\ y = x - x \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge x where the latter is evaluated in the Boolean lattice x \\\\wedge S \\\\wedge x. In the presence of (D3) and (0), \\\\ is characterized by the identities: y \\\\wedge x/y = 0 = x/y \\\\wedge y and (x \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge x) \\\\vee x/y = x = x/y \\\\vee (x \\\\wedge y \\\\wedge x). (S B) One thus has a variety of skew Boolean algebras (S ; \\\\vee, \\\\wedge, /, 0) characterized by identities (D3), (0) and (S B). A primitive skew Boolean algebra consists of 0 and a single non-0 D-class. Thus it is the result of adjoining a 0 to a rectangular skew lattice D via (0) with x/y = x, if y = 0 and 0 otherwise. Every skew Boolean algebra is a subdirect product of primitive algebras. Skew Boolean algebras play an important role in the study of discriminator varieties and other generalizations in universal algebra of Boolean behavior.Bignall, R.

Skew lattices in rings Let A be a ring and let E(A) denote the set of all Idempotents in A. For all x, y \\\\in A set x \\\\wedge y = xy and x \\\\vee y = x + y - xy . Clearly \\\\wedge but also \\\\vee is associative. If a subset S \\\\subseteq E(A) is closed under \\\\wedge and \\\\vee , then (S, \\\\wedge, \\\\vee) is a distributive, cancellative skew lattice. To find such skew lattices in E(A) one looks at bands in E(A), especially the ones that are maximal with respect to some constraint. In fact, every multiplicative band in () that is maximal with respect to being right regular (= ) is also closed under \\\\vee and so forms a right-handed skew lattice. In general, every right regular band in E(A) generates a right-handed skew lattice in E(A). Dual remarks also hold for left regular bands (bands satisfying the identity xyx = xy) in E(A). Maximal regular bands need not to be closed under \\\\vee as defined; counterexamples are easily found using multiplicative rectangular bands. These cases are closed, however, under the cubic variant of \\\\vee defined by x abla y = x + y + yx - xyx - yxy since in these cases x abla y reduces to yx to give the dual rectangular band. By replacing the condition of regularity by normality (xyz w = xz yw), every maximal normal multiplicative band S in E(A) is also closed under abla with (S ; \\\\wedge, \\\\vee, /, 0), where x/y = x - xyx, forms a Boolean skew lattice. When E(A) itself is closed under multiplication, then it is a normal band and thus forms a Boolean skew lattice. In fact, any skew Boolean algebra can be embedded into such an algebra.Cvetko-Vah, K, Skew lattices in matrix rings, Algebra Universalis 53 (2005), 471-479. When A has a multiplicative identity 1, the condition that E(A) is multiplicatively closed is well known to imply that E(A) forms a Boolean algebra. Skew lattices in rings continue to be a good source of examples and motivation.Cvetko-Vah, K, Pure skew lattices in rings, Semigroup Forum 68 (2004), 268-279.Cvetko-Vah, K, Pure ‚àá-bands, Semigroup Forum 71 (2005), 93-101.Cvetko-Vah, K, Skew lattices in rings, Dissertation, University of Ljubljana, 2005.Cvetko-Vah, K and J Leech, Associativity of the ‚àá-operation on bands in rings, Semigroup Forum 76 (2008), 32-50 Primitive skew lattices Skew lattices consisting of exactly two D-classes are called primitive skew lattices. Given such a skew lattice S with D-classes A > B in S/D, then for any a \\\\in A and b \\\\in B, the subsets A \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge A ={u \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge u : u \\\\in A} \\\\subseteq B and B \\\\vee a \\\\vee B = {v \\\\vee a \\\\vee v : v \\\\in B} \\\\subseteq A are called, respectively, cosets of A in B and cosets of B in A. These cosets partition B and A with b \\\\in A\\\\wedge b\\\\wedge A and a \\\\in B\\\\wedge a\\\\wedge B. Cosets are always rectangular subalgebras in their D-classes. What is more, the partial order \\\\geq induces a coset bijection \\\\varphi : B \\\\vee a \\\\vee B \\\\rightarrow A \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge A defined by: \\\\phi (x) = y iff x > y, for x \\\\in B \\\\vee a \\\\vee B and y \\\\in A \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge A. Collectively, coset bijections describe \\\\geq between the subsets A and B. They also determine \\\\vee and \\\\wedge for pairs of elements from distinct D-classes. Indeed, given a \\\\in A and b \\\\in B, let \\\\varphi be the cost bijection between the cosets B\\\\vee a\\\\vee B in A and A \\\\wedge b \\\\wedge A in B. Then: a\\\\vee b = a\\\\vee \\\\varphi -1(b), b\\\\vee a = \\\\varphi -1(b)\\\\vee a and a\\\\wedge b = \\\\varphi(a)\\\\wedge b , b\\\\wedge a = b\\\\wedge \\\\varphi (a). In general, given a, c \\\\in A and b, d \\\\in B with a > b and c > d, then a, c belong to a common B\\\\- coset in A and b, d belong to a common A-coset in B if and only if a > b // c > d. Thus each coset bijection is, in some sense, a maximal collection of mutually parallel pairs a > b. Every primitive skew lattice S factors as the fibred product of its maximal left and right- handed primitive images S/R \\\\times_2 S/L. Right-handed primitive skew lattices are constructed as follows. Let A = \\\\cup _i A_i and B = \\\\cup _j B_j be partitions of disjoint nonempty sets A and B, where all A_i and B_j share a common size. For each pair i, j pick a fixed bijection \\\\varphi_i,j from A_i onto B_j. On A and B separately set x\\\\wedge y = y and x\\\\vee y = x; but given a \\\\in A and b \\\\in B, set a \\\\vee b = a, b \\\\vee a = a', a \\\\wedge b = b and b \\\\wedge a = b' where \\\\varphi_{i,j}(a') = b and \\\\varphi_{i,j}(a) = b' with a' belonging to the cell A_i of a and b' belonging to the cell B_j of b. The various \\\\varphi i,j are the coset bijections. This is illustrated in the following partial Hasse diagram where A_i = B_j = 2 and the arrows indicate the \\\\varphi_{i,j} -outputs and \\\\geq from A and B. File:Skew primitive.png One constructs left- handed primitive skew lattices in dual fashion. All right [left] handed primitive skew lattices can be constructed in this fashion. The coset structure of skew lattices A nonrectangular skew lattice S is covered by its maximal primitive skew lattices: given comparable D-classes A > B in S/D, A \\\\cup B forms a maximal primitive subalgebra of S and every D-class in S lies in such a subalgebra. The coset structures on these primitive subalgebras combine to determine the outcomes x\\\\vee y and x\\\\wedge y at least when x and y are comparable under \\\\preceq . It turns out that x\\\\vee y and x\\\\wedge y are determined in general by cosets and their bijections, although in a slightly less direct manner than the \\\\preceq -comparable case. In particular, given two incomparable D-classes A and B with join D-class J and meet D-class M in S/D, interesting connections arise between the two coset decompositions of J (or M) with respect to A and B. File:Skew diamond.png Thus a skew lattice may be viewed as a coset atlas of rectangular skew lattices placed on the vertices of a lattice and coset bijections between them, the latter seen as partial isomorphisms between the rectangular algebras with each coset bijection determining a corresponding pair of cosets. This perspective gives, in essence, the Hasse diagram of the skew lattice, which is easily drawn in cases of relatively small order. (See the diagrams in Section 3 above.) Given a chain of D-classes A > B > C in S/D, one has three sets of coset bijections: from A to B, from B to C and from A to C. In general, given coset bijections \\\\varphi: A \\\\rightarrow B and \\\\psi: B \\\\rightarrow C, the composition of partial bijections \\\\psi \\\\varphi could be empty. If it is not, then a unique coset bijection \\\\chi: A \\\\rightarrow C exists such that \\\\psi \\\\varphi \\\\subseteq \\\\chi . (Again, \\\\chi is a bijection between a pair of cosets in A and C.) This inclusion can be strict. It is always an equality (given \\\\psi \\\\varphi eq \\\\empty ) on a given skew lattice S precisely when S is categorical. In this case, by including the identity maps on each rectangular D-class and adjoining empty bijections between properly comparable D-classes, one has a category of rectangular algebras and coset bijections between them. The simple examples in Section 3 are categorical.

The user aims their turret with the scroll wheel and shoots with the middle \\"select\\" button. Destroying a helicopter will release debris that can destroy other helicopters or paratroopers. Shooting a paratroopers will not release anything that can harm other enemies, however, shooting the parachute will cause the paratrooper to fall and kill any paratroopers directly below.Info on iPod games from Apple Inc. One point is deducted for every shot taken. Destroying a target in any way (by firing, with debris from helicopters, etc.) awards two points. Thus performing multiple hits with a single shot exploiting the debris is the main technique to reach high scores; for example shooting at a single helicopter and also destroying with the debris another helicopter and a parachute will result in 2+2+2-1=5 points, instead of the 3 points that would be scored by killing each of the 3 items with a 'dedicated' shot. Sometime during game play paratroopers stop appearing and falling, letting the player fire at the helicopters with no further risks of being destroyed, and easily reach the maximum score of 1000 points; no known exploits had been found to generate this scenario consistently. When the player loses, debris falls on the turret, causing it to explode. The player may then press the \\"select\\" button again, initiating a new game.

It is a 20-item inventory of perceived personality traits and recorded behaviors, intended to be completed on the basis of a semi- structured interview along with a review of 'collateral information' such as official records. The PCL was originally developed in the 1970s by Canadian psychologist Robert D. Hare for use in psychology experiments, based partly on Hare's work with male offenders and forensic inmates in Vancouver, and partly on an influential clinical profile by American psychiatrist Hervey M. Cleckley first published in 1941. An individual's score may have important consequences for their future, and because the potential for harm if the test is used or administered incorrectly is considerable, Hare argues that the test should be considered valid only if administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under scientifically controlled and licensed, standardized conditions.Hare, R. D., & Neumann, C. N. (2006). The PCL-R Assessment of Psychopathy: Development, Structural Properties, and New Directions. In C. Patrick (Ed.), Handbook of Psychopathy (pp. 58‚Äì88). New York: Guilford. Hare receives royalties on licensed use of the test. In psychometric terms, the current version of the checklist has two factors (sets of related scores) that correlate about 0.5 with each other, with Factor One closer to Cleckley's original personality concept than Factor Two. Hare's checklist does not incorporate the \\"positive adjustment features\\" that Cleckley did. PCL-R model of psychopathy The PCL-R is used for indicating a dimensional score, or a categorical diagnosis, of psychopathy for clinical, legal, or research purposes. It is rated by a mental health professional (such as a psychologist or other professional trained in the field of mental health, psychology, or psychiatry), using 20 items. Each of the items in the PCL-R is scored on a three-point scale according to specific criteria through file information and a semi-structured interview. The scores are used to predict risk for criminal re-offense and probability of rehabilitation. The current edition of the PCL-R officially lists three factors (1.a, 1.b, and 2.a), which summarize the 20 assessed areas via factor analysis. The previous edition of the PCL-R listed two factors. Factor 1 is labelled \\"selfish, callous and remorseless use of others\\". Factor 2 is labelled as \\"chronically unstable, antisocial and socially deviant lifestyle\\". There is a high risk of recidivism and mostly small likelihood of rehabilitation for those who are labelled as having \\"psychopathy\\" on the basis of the PCL-R ratings in the manual for the test, although treatment research is ongoing. PCL-R Factors 1a and 1b are correlated with narcissistic personality disorder. They are associated with extraversion and positive affect. Factor 1, the so-called core personality traits of psychopathy, may even be beneficial for the psychopath (in terms of nondeviant social functioning). PCL-R Factors 2a and 2b are particularly strongly correlated to antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder and are associated with reactive anger, criminality, and impulsive violence. The target group for the PCL-R in prisons in some countries is criminals convicted of delict and/or felony. The quality of ratings may depend on how much background information is available and whether the person rated is honest and forthright. Items Each of the 20 items in the PCL-R is scored on a three-point scale, with a rating of 0 if it does not apply at all, 1 if there is a partial match or mixed information, and 2 if there is a reasonably good match to the offender. This is said to be ideally done through a face-to-face interview together with supporting information on lifetime behavior (e.g., from case files), but is also done based only on file information. It can take up to three hours to collect and review the information. Out of a maximum score of 40, the cut-off for the label of psychopathy is 30 in the United States and 25 in the United Kingdom. A cut-off score of 25 is also sometimes used for research purposes. High PCL-R scores are positively associated with measures of impulsivity and aggression, Machiavellianism, persistent criminal behavior, and negatively associated with measures of empathy and affiliation. Early factor analysis of the PCL-R indicated it consisted of two factors. Factor 1 captures traits dealing with the interpersonal and affective deficits of psychopathy (e.g., shallow affect, superficial charm, manipulativeness, lack of empathy) whereas factor 2 dealt with symptoms relating to antisocial behavior (e.g., criminal versatility, impulsiveness, irresponsibility, poor behavior controls, juvenile delinquency). The two factors have been found by those following this theory to display different correlates. Factor 1 has been correlated with narcissistic personality disorder, low anxiety, low empathy, low stress reaction and low suicide risk but high scores on scales of achievement and social potency. In addition, the use of item response theory analysis of female offender PCL-R scores indicates factor 1 items are more important in measuring and generalizing the construct of psychopathy in women than factor 2 items. In contrast, factor 2 was found to be related to antisocial personality disorder, social deviance, sensation seeking, low socioeconomic status and high risk of suicide. The two factors are nonetheless highly correlated and there are strong indications they do result from a single underlying disorder. Research, however, has failed to replicate the two-factor model in female samples. In 2001 researchers Cooke and Michie at Glasgow Caledonian University suggested, using statistical analysis involving confirmatory factor analysis, that a three-factor structure may provide a better model, with those items from factor 2 strictly relating to antisocial behavior (criminal versatility, juvenile delinquency, revocation of conditional release, early behavioral problems and poor behavioral controls) removed. The remaining items would be divided into three factors: arrogant and deceitful interpersonal style, deficient affective experience and impulsive and irresponsible behavioral style. Hare and colleagues have criticized the Cooke & Michie three-factor model for statistical and conceptual problems, like in fact consisting of up to ten different factors and resulting in impossible parameters (negative variances). In the 2003 edition of the PCL-R, Hare added a fourth antisocial behavior factor, consisting of those factor 2 items excluded in the previous model. Again, these models are presumed to be hierarchical with a single, unified psychopathy disorder underlying the distinct but correlated factors. In the four-factor model of the psychopathy, supported by a range of samples, the factors represent the interpersonal, affective, lifestyle, and overt antisocial features of the personality disorder. Usage The PCL-R is widely used to assess individuals in high security psychiatric units, prisons and other settings. This may be of help in deciding who should be detained or released, or who should undergo what kind of treatment. It is also used in academic psychology for its original purpose as an assistive tool in studies on the pathology of psychopathy. The PCL-R also has some wide use as a risk assessment tool that attempts to predict who will offend or reoffend. It has been touted as unparalleled in its ability in this regard, and there have been some positive studies, especially early on. However, several recent studies and very large-scale meta-analysis have cast serious doubt on whether it performs as well as other instruments, or better than chance, and to the extent that it does, whether this is largely due its inclusion of past offending history, rather than the personality trait scores that make it unique.Violence risk meta-meta: Instrument choice does matter: Despite popularity, psychopathy test and actuarials not superior to other prediction methods Karen Franklin, Ph.D. forensic psychologist and adjunct professor, 2011SVP risk tools show 'disappointing' reliability in real-world use Karen Franklin, Ph.D. forensic psychologist and adjunct professor, 2011 In addition although in controlled research environments the inter-rater reliability of the PCL-R may be satisfactory, in real-world settings it has been found to have rather poor agreement between different raters, especially on the personality trait scores. Further, a review which pooled together various risk assessment instruments including the PCL, found that peer-reviewed studies on which the developer or translator of the instrument was an author (which in no case was disclosed in the journal article) were twice as likely to report positive predictive findings. On the purported basis of concerns about false positives, inadequately trained raters, and general misuse or overuse of the test including with different racial groups, an advice guide was published in 2011 on how to pass the Hare PCL-R.Pass the PCL-R: Your Guide to Passing the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised AKA the Psychopath Test. Abraham Gentry. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2011 There are additional inventories directly from the PCL-R, including the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV) and Psychopathy Checklist: Youth Version (PCL:YV). The PCL:SV was developed as a labor-saving assessment for the same forensic settings as the PCL-R and to meet the needs of settings where clients do not necessarily have criminal records (e.g. civil psychiatric patients). It includes 12 items and takes 90 minutes. According to the MacArthur violence risk assessment study, there is a stronger correlation between the PCL:SV results and later violence than any other of the 134 variables evaluated in that study. The PCL:YV assesses early signs of juvenile psychopathy in children and adolescents. Comparison with psychiatric diagnoses Among laypersons and professionals, there is much confusion about the meanings and differences between psychopathy, sociopathy, antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), and the ICD-10 diagnosis, dissocial personality disorder. Hare takes the stance that psychopathy as a syndrome should be considered distinct from the DSM-IV's antisocial personality disorder construct, although the DSM states ASPD has been referred to as or includes the disorder of psychopathy. However, those who created the DSM-IV felt that there was too much room for subjectivity on the part of clinicians when identifying things like remorse and guilt; therefore, the DSM-IV panel decided to stick to observable behavior, namely socially deviant behaviors. As a result, the diagnosis of ASPD is something that the \\"majority of criminals easily meet\\".Hare, Robert D. Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of Psychopaths Among Us, (New York: Pocket Books, 1993) p. 25. Hare goes further to say that the percentage of incarcerated criminals that meet the requirements of ASPD is somewhere between 80 and 85 percent, whereas only about 20% of these criminals would qualify for a psychopathy diagnosis using the PCL-R. This twenty percent, according to Hare, accounts for 50 percent of all the most serious crimes committed, including half of all serial and repeat rapists. Although the diagnosis of ASPD covers two to three times as many prisoners than the diagnosis of psychopathy, Hare believes the PCL-R is better able to predict future criminality, violence, and recidivism than a diagnosis of ASPD. He suggests there are differences between PCL-R-diagnosed psychopaths and non-psychopaths on \\"processing and use of linguistic and emotional information\\", while such differences are potentially smaller between those diagnosed with ASPD and without. Additionally, Hare argued confusion regarding how to diagnose ASPD, confusion regarding the difference between ASPD and psychopathy, as well as the differing future prognoses regarding recidivism and treatability, may have serious consequences in settings such as court cases where psychopathy is often seen as aggravating the crime. Hare wants the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders to list psychopathy as a unique disorder, saying psychopathy has no precise equivalentHare, R. D. Psychopathy and Antisocial Personality Disorder: A Case of Diagnostic Confusion, Psychiatric Times, February 1996, XIII, Issue 2 Accessed June 26, 2006 in either the DSM-IV-TR, where it is most strongly correlated with the diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, or the ICD-10, which has a similar diagnosis called dissocial personality disorder. Both organizations state their diagnoses have been referred to as or include the disorder of psychopathy. But only a minority of those in institutions whom Hare and his followers would diagnose as psychopaths are violent offenders. Other PCL-R findings According to Hare, one FBI study produced in 1992 found that 44 percent of offenders who killed a police officer were psychopaths.Hare, Robert D. Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of Psychopaths Among Us, (New York: Pocket Books, 1993) pp. 25‚Äì30. The study was 'Killed in the Line of Duty: A Study of Selected Felonious Killings of Law Enforcement Officers.'The FBI‚Äôs National Law Enforcement Safety Initiative By Charles E. Miller III, Henry F. Hanburger, Michael Sumeracki, and Marcus Young (2010) There has been some controversy over the use of the PCL-R by UK prison and secure psychiatric services, including its role in the government's new administrative category of 'Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder' (a separate older administrative category of 'psychopathic disorder' in the Mental Health Act was abolished in 2007). One leading forensic psychologist, while Deputy Chief at the Ministry of Justice, has argued that it has not lived up to claims that it could identify those who would not benefit from current treatments or those most likely to violently reoffend. A study by one of Hare's students, Randy Kropp, on a group of prisoners found that among those who had low scores on the PCL-R, about 20 to 25 percent would be re-convicted within four or five years, while in the \\"high group\\", that risk was about 80 percent. A study using the PCL-R to examine the relationship between antisocial behavior and suicide found that suicide history was strongly correlated to PCL-R factor 2 (reflecting antisocial deviance) and was not correlated to PCL-R factor 1 (reflecting affective functioning). Given that ASPD relates to factor 2, whereas psychopathy relates to both factors, this would confirm Hervey M. Cleckley's assertion that psychopaths are relatively immune to suicide. People with ASPD, on the other hand, have a relatively high suicide rate. The PCL-R is sometimes used to assess risk of sexual (re)offending, with mixed results.Leam Craig, Kevin Browne, Anthony R. Beech (2008) Assessing Risk in Sex Offenders p. 117 John Wiley and Sons, Since psychopaths frequently cause harm through their actions, it is assumed that they are not emotionally attached to the people they harm; however, according to the PCL-R checklist, psychopaths are also careless in the way they treat themselves. They frequently fail to alter their behavior in a way that would prevent them from enduring future discomfort. Because an individual's scores may have important consequences for his or her future, the potential for harm if the test is used or administered incorrectly is considerable. The test can only be considered valid if administered by a suitably qualified and experienced clinician under controlled conditions. Hare has described psychopaths as 'social predators',Hare, Robert D. Without Conscience: The Disturbing World of Psychopaths Among Us, (New York: Pocket Books, 1993) 'remorseless predators',D. J. Cooke, A. E. Forth, & R. D. Hare (Eds.), Psychopathy: Theory, research, and implications for society Springer, 1998 or in some cases 'lethal predators', and has stated that 'Psychopathic depredations affect people in all races, cultures, and ethnic groups, and at all levels of income and social status'.Hare, Robert D, Psychopaths: New Trends in Research. The Harvard Mental Health Letter, September 1995 Criticism In addition to the aforementioned report by Cooke and Michie that a three-factor structure may provide a better model than the two-factor structure, Hare's concept and checklist have faced other criticisms. In 2010, there was controversy after it emerged that Hare had threatened legal action that stopped publication of a peer-reviewed article on the PCL-R. Hare alleged the article quoted or paraphrased him incorrectly. The article eventually appeared three years later. It alleged that the checklist is wrongly viewed by many as the basic definition of psychopathy, yet it leaves out key factors, while also making criminality too central to the concept. The authors claimed this leads to problems in overdiagnosis and in the use of the checklist to secure convictions. Hare has since stated that he receives less than $35,000 a year from royalties associated with the checklist and its derivatives. Hare's concept has also been criticised as being only weakly applicable to real-world settings and tending towards tautology. It is also said to be vulnerable to \\"labeling effects\\", to be over-simplistic, reductionistic, to embody the fundamental attribution error, and not pay enough attention to context and the dynamic nature of human behavior. It has been pointed out that half the criteria can also be signs of mania, hypomania, or frontal lobe dysfunction (e.g., glibness/superficial charm, grandiosity, poor behavioral controls, promiscuous sexual behavior, and irresponsibility).Dorothy Otnow Lewis, MD, Catherine A. Yeager, MA, Pamela Blake, MD, Barbara Bard, PhD, and Maren Strenziok, MS Ethics Questions Raised by the Neuropsychiatric, Neuropsychological, Educational, Developmental, and Family Characteristics of 18 Juveniles Awaiting Execution in Texas J Am Acad Psychiatry Law 32:408‚Äì29, 2004 Some research suggests that ratings made using the PCL system depend on the personality of the person doing the rating, including how empathic they themselves are. One forensic researcher has suggested that future studies need to examine the class background, race and philosophical beliefs of raters because they may not be aware of enacting biased judgments of people whose section of society or individual lives for whom they have no understanding of or empathy.

The name is a portmanteau of petticoat (ultimately from French petit, \\"small\\") and pants. Pettipants are similar to long shorts, though they may be made from material such as cotton and lace, and usually have ruffles down each leg. They are available in different lengths up to knee length. In the sixties, they were available in many styles and colors. Nylon and polyester fabrics were used rather than cotton. Lace trim was used. Pettipants are a replacement for a slip. When pettipants were fashionable (they were worn widely in the US during the 1960s) they were usually worn under skirts, dresses, culottes, or walking shorts for modesty or comfort. However, they are not considered a modern or popular style; currently they are most likely to be worn by square dancers or persons involved in historical reenactment.

In 1975, he gained prominence in a fight for gay rights with the University of Saskatchewan. The university's dean of the College of Education refused to allow Wilson into the school system to supervise practice teachers because of his public involvement with the gay liberation movement. Wilson was vice-president of the Gay Community Centre Saskatoon and had been trying to start a gay academic union at the university. The Saskatchewan Human Rights Commission failed to protect Wilson and his case was unsuccessful. Wilson spent most of his life fighting for human rights issues, activism and AIDS organizations. In 1977 he founded Stubblejumper Press, a small publishing house dedicated to works by Canadian lesbians and gay men. The company's first title was Wilson's own poetry collection The Myth of the Boy.The Body Politic, Issue 53 (1978). He served as executive director of the Saskatchewan Association on Human Rights from 1978 to 1983. In 1983 Wilson moved to Toronto to work for the Toronto Board of Education as an advisor to the Race Relations and Equal Opportunity Office. In 1984 he became one of the founding publishers of Rites: for lesbian and gay liberation. Wilson was the first openly gay candidate to be nominated by a major political party to stand for Parliament, as a candidate of the New Democratic Party in the Toronto riding of Rosedale in the 1988 election. During the campaign he was diagnosed with AIDS. He spent the rest of his life as an AIDS activist, helping to found AIDS Action Now! and founding chairperson of the Canadian Network of Organizations for People Living With AIDS. Wilson published his partner Peter McGehee's novels, Boys Like Us (1991) and Sweetheart (1992). One month before his death, he completed McGehee's notes of his third novel, Labour of Love (1993). Wilson died on September 24, 1992 at the age of 42. In 1995 the University of Saskatchewan's gay organization (Gays and Lesbians at the U of S, GLUS) established the Doug Wilson Award, given annually to honour those individuals who have shown leadership and courage in advancing the rights of gays & lesbians at the University of Saskatchewan. The University of Saskatchewan Students' Union (USSU) has presented the award since 2001, after GLUS folded following the establishment of the USSU-run Pride Centre. In March 2009, Stubblejumper, a film about Doug Wilson was screened in venues across Saskatchewan. It was directed by Saskatchewan filmmaker David Geiss. In honour of his role as a significant builder of LGBT culture and history in Canada, a portrait of Wilson by artist Alfred Ng is held in the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives' National Portrait Collection.

She was a member of the House of Austria-Este, a branch of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. Biography Maria Ludovika was born in Monza, but her family fled from Italy to Austria when Northern Italy was conquered by Napoleon in 1796. This caused her a hostility for Napoleon. In Austria, the Emperor fell in love with her during his visits to her mother. On 6 January 1808 she married her first cousin Francis I, Emperor of Austria, King of Hungary and Bohemia. They had no children. She is not to be confused with Marie-Louise of Austria (who was given the Latin baptismal name of Maria Ludovica Leopoldina Francisca Theresa Josepha Lucia), who married Napoleon in 1810. She, as leader of the war party in Austria, was a great enemy of the French Emperor Napoleon I of France and therefore also in opposition to the Austrian foreign minister Prince Klemens Wenzel von Metternich. The French had protested against the marriage because of her political views. She had considerable influence on her husband, and her talent at ruling marvelled many officials, including the Prussian minister who considered her the ruling genius at court. Maria Ludovika was also immensely popular with her subjects who hailed her a second Maria Theresa. Together with her brother-in-law Archduke Johann, she made the war effort popular. During her coronation in Pressburg, she impressed the Hungarians so much that they declared large financial and military support for the monarchy if needed. But the Emperor hesitated and Archduke Karl who had extensive control over military matters advised caution. Only the effects of the Spanish revolt in 1808 allowed the war party to prevail. Empress Maria Ludovica, with three of her stepchildren: Ferdinand, Maria Leopoldina and Franz Karl Metternich showed her private correspondence with her relatives to her husband, the Emperor Francis I, in the hope that it would miscredit her. She was conservative in her views, suspicious of peasant revolts, but also patriotic towards her adopted land, and genuinely disturbed by atrocities that Napoleon's armies created in Spain. She supported the war against Napoleonic France in 1808. From this year, her health deteriorated. She was opposed to the marriage between Napoleon and her step-daughter Marie Louise in 1809. In 1812, she was a reluctant guest to the assembly of German monarchs gathered by Napoleon to celebrate his war against Russia. She was the hostess of the Vienna congress in 1815. When Napoleon was finally defeated she traveled at the end of the year 1815 to her home country, North Italy, but died of tuberculosis in Verona. She was only 28 years old.Brigitte Hamann: Die Habsburger. 1988, p. 333f. She is buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. The Ludovica Military Academy in Budapest established in 1808 was named after Maria Ludovika who contributed 50,000 Forint for its upkeep from the funds of the Honours list proclaimed at the Coronation in St. Martin's Cathedral, in Pressburg. Goethe admired Maria Ludovika greatly, and felt tortured because he promised never to pay a public tribute to her nor mention her name in public.

It encompass an area of spanning parts of Custer, Boise, Blaine, and Elmore counties, and is bordered to the east by the Sawtooth Valley. Much of the mountain range is within the Sawtooth Wilderness, part of the Sawtooth National Recreation Area and Sawtooth National Forest. The mountains were named for their jagged peaks. Peaks There are 57 peaks with an elevation over in the Sawtooth Range, all falling between on Thompson Peak, the highest point in the range. Another 77 peaks fall between . Climbs range in difficulty between the Observation Peak, a Class 1 hike, and King Spire, a rock route rated Class 5.10 on the Yosemite Decimal System. Geology The northern Sawtooth Range formed from the Eocene Sawtooth batholith, while south of Alturas Lake the mountains formed from the Cretaceous granodiorite of the Idaho Batholith. The Sawtooth Range has a history of alpine glaciation, but while no surface glaciers exist today, perennial snow fields and rock glaciers remain, usually on north or east facing slopes. There have been 202 perennial snow fields mapped in the Sawtooth Range. The Sawtooth Range was last extensively glaciated in the Pleistocene, but glaciers probably existed during the Little Ice Age, which ended around 1850 AD. Evidence of past glaciation given remnants of the glaciers such as glacial lakes, moraines, horns, hanging valleys, cirques, and ar√™tes. =Seismology= In 2010, scientists from Idaho State University discovered the Sawtooth Fault near the base of the mountains, running for near Stanley and Redfish Lake. The most recent large quakes along it occurred around 4,000 and 7,000 years ago. It is estimated the fault could produce a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, potentially felt as far as Boise. Waterways McGown Peak and Stanley Lake Edna Lake Toxaway Lake The Sawtooth Range is home to hundreds of lakes created by vanished alpine glaciers, with nearly 400 lakes in the Sawtooth Wilderness. Five of the six largest lakes in the range are located outside the wilderness (Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, Yellow Belly, and Stanley lakes), while Sawtooth Lake is within the wilderness. Most of the east side of the Sawtooth Range is drained by the main stem of the Salmon River and the west side by the South Fork Payette River. Small portions of the northern and southern ends of the range are in the watersheds of the Middle Fork Salmon River and Boise River, respectively. Recreation There are 40 trails totaling nearly in the Sawtooth Wilderness that can be used for day hiking, backpacking, and horseback riding and accessed from 23 trailheads. Additional trails traverse the foothills of the mountains outside the designated wilderness. Camping is permitted anywhere in the wilderness. There are several developed campgrounds on the western side of range, outside the Sawtooth Wilderness, including at Redfish, Little Redfish, Alturas, Pettit, and Stanley lakes, as well as at Iron Creek. Restrictions on fires and animals apply in some areas.

The work is unique in that it employs not alphabets, but is composed entirely in Kannada numerals. The Saangathya metre of Kannada poetry is employed in the work. It uses numerals 1 through 64 and employs various patterns or bandhas in a frame of 729 (27√ó27) squares to represent alphabets in nearly 18 scripts and over 700 languages. Author The work is attributed to Jain monk Kumudendu Muni. He claims that he was guru of Amoghavarsha of Manyakheta and a disciple of virasena and jinasena of Dhavala. However, not much is known about this monk. Scholars are divided about when he lived. Karlamangalam Srikantaiah, the editor of the first edition, claims that the work may have been composed around 800 AD. Dr Venkatachala Sastry, however, dates him and his work to the 15th century. He also claims that Kumudendu Muni belonged to a village called Yalavalli near Nandidurga in Chikkaballapura Taluk in Kolar district. He further dates the work to around the 1550-1600 period and suggests it might be even more recent. The Work The work is said to have around 600,000 verses, nearly 6 times as big as the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata. Totally there are 26 chapters constituting it a big volume of which only three have been decoded. =Coverage= The author expounds that many philosophies which existed in the Jain classics are eloquently and skillfully interpreted in the work. It is also believed to contain valuable information about various sciences including mathematics, chemistry, physics, astronomy, medicine, history, space travel, etc. Karlamangalam Srikantaiah, the editor of the first edition, has claimed that the work contains instructions for travel in water and space travel. It is also said that the work contains information about the production of modern weapons. It is also claimed to consist of works in several languages including Sanskrit, Marathi, Telugu, Tamil, Prakrit, etc., apart from Kannada. Different languages can be realised by assigning different alphabets to different numbers. =Codification= Some of the patterns used include the Chakrabandha, Hamsabandha, Varapadmabandha, Sagarabandha, Sarasabandha, Kruanchabandha, Mayurabandha, Ramapadabandha, Nakhabandha, etc. As each of these patterns are identified and decoded, the contents can be read. Though written in Kannada its numerical enunciation enables the people of other languages to comprehend it. =Challenges= There are 16,000 chakras in all. Out of which only 1,270 chakras are available. There are 9 khanda's in all. The available 1270 chakra\\"s belong to Prathama khanda (I)called Mangala Prabhruta.

It has been claimed that it is possible to decipher 6 lakh Shlokas or verses. Since no contemporary pandit is conversant with the esoteric metres employed in the work, the work of deciphering is being done with the help of computers. The whereabouts of remaining chakra's (16,000 - 1,270) = 14,730 are not known. Reactions S.

Such radars are characterized by their ability to detect movement at ground level of targets such as an individual walking or crawling towards a facility. Such radars typically have ranges of several hundred metres to over 10 kilometres.Radartutorial Alternate technologies include laser-based systems. These have the potential for very high target position accuracy, however they are less effective in the presence of fog and other obscurants. Characteristics PSR's usually have the following required characteristics: *No operator required: The radar autonomously detects movement in a defined area, tracks those targets and raises an alarm if the targets cross into alarm areas. *Export of target data: The radar not only has its own dedicated display and alarm system, but also outputs data to other systems that form the security network. A typical interface system today would include target data output over Extensible Markup Language (XML) at a useful target data rate (0.1 Hz to 1 Hz). *Coverage: a radar that covers more area can be potentially more useful than a radar that covers a limited sector. PSRs cover areas between 80¬∞ to 360¬∞. *Resolution: a radar that operates at higher frequencies and with narrower beams will determine target positions most accurately. *Low false alarm rates: a radar that puts out false targets is at best an irritant and tactically can confuse the security team. A good PSR should have a designed false alarm rate of two or less false alarms per day. (A false alarm should not be confused with a nuisance alarm caused by, for example, an animal). Characteristics of some perimeter surveillance radar systems: *Carrier frequencies range from C-band (about 5 GHz) to W band (about 77 GHz). *Modulation characteristics include CW, FMCW, and pulsed. FMCW based systems typically have very high range resolution, often better than 1 metre. *Ranges from 300 meters to over 10 km. *Detection methods include Doppler (requiring movement relative to the transmitter) and clutter mapping (movement in any direction). *Area coverage rates: from 1 to 10 updates per second. *Mechanical Movement: Older PSRs rely on rotating antennas while newer designs rely on Beamforming technology which requires no moving parts. This may dramatically increase the reliability of the PSR while making the PSR more complex by requiring many receive and/or transmit channels. Challenges to PSR Perimeter surveillance radars may operate in areas with high clutter levels. In the range of frequencies used almost all objects return some reflection from the radar, as does the ground itself. Foliage presents a particular problem as it is both a barrier to the radar energy, as well as an area in which it is difficult to detect a moving target due to the foliage being blown by the wind appearing as multiple moving targets. To a degree, Doppler based radar can detect movement in such areas, as long as the component of movement velocity towards or away from the radar is significant enough to generate a signal that overcomes the foliage return signal. Radar does not have enough resolution to identify one person from another, so cannot be used as a substitute for CCTV. Many PSRs directly interface to control daylight or thermal cameras using a \\"slew to cue\\" system to overcome this problem. Total automation may be achieved if the camera uses analytics.

As a junior for the Bobcats, he was named the Big Sky Player of the Year.http://www.msubobcats.com/news/2013/6/13/FB_0613131141.aspx Kollar went on to earn Most Valuable Player honors at the 1974 Senior Bowl and was inducted into the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame in 2014. His jersey #77 has been retired by Montana State. Coaching career =Early Years= He began coaching as a defensive assistant and special teams coach for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers under coach John McKay in 1984. He then spent three seasons at the University of Illinois, first as a graduate assistant and then a defensive line/special teams coach, and two years at Purdue University. =NFL= Kollar began his NFL coaching career as the defensive line coach for the Atlanta Falcons in 1990. He spent more than a decade (1990-2000) coaching the defensive line for the Falcons, highlighted by an NFC Championship in 1998 and an appearance in Super Bowl XXXIII against Denver. Kollar then spent five seasons coaching the defensive line in St. Louis. Kollar‚Äôs defensive line was instrumental in the Rams‚Äô 2001 Super Bowl run as the club ranked third in the NFL in rush defense (85.9 ypg) while tying for the seventh-most sacks (45) in the league. Kollar then spent three years coaching the defensive line in Buffalo (2006-08), where he coached future All-Pro defensive tackle Kyle Williams and two-time Pro Bowl defensive end Aaron Schobel. Houston Texans Kollar joined the Houston Texans in 2009 and spent six years there, including his first five years as assistant head coach/defensive line. During his tenure with the Texans, the team ranked eighth in the NFL in total defense (329 .4 ypg) and third in the league in opponent third-down percentage (35.9). Kollar‚Äôs unit adjusted to the defense‚Äôs transition to a 3-4 scheme in 2011 under Houston Defensive Coordinator Wade Phillips. The Texans went on to post the third-largest defensive turnaround (-91.2 ypg) in NFL history in 2011. Defensive ends Mario Williams, Antonio Smith and J.J. Watt combined for five Pro Bowls playing for Kollar in Houston. Denver Broncos After the 2014 season, Kollar left the Texans and became the Denver Broncos defensive line coach, where he reunited with Gary Kubiak. On February 7, 2016, Kollar was part of the Broncos coaching staff that won Super Bowl 50. In the game, the Broncos defeated the Carolina Panthers by a score of 24‚Äì10. Personal life Kollar and his wife, Jan, have two sons, Chad and Clint. In 1995, Kollar was inducted into his hometown Warren Sports Hall of Fame.http://warrensportshof.com/inductees.php On April 10, 2014, he was named to the Senior Bowl Hall of Fame, commemorating the 40th anniversary of his being named MVP of the annual college all-star game.

The school was founded in 1594 by Anne Sackville, Lady Dacre and Queen Elizabeth I and occupies a 12-acre (4.9 ha) site close to Clapham Junction railway station. The school is part of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and at the start of the 2017‚Äì18 academic year had 907 pupils between the ages of ten and eighteen, paying fees of ¬£17,997 per year. It teaches the GCSE and A-Level syllabuses. History Emanuel School is one of five schools administered by the United Westminster Schools' Foundation. It came into being by the will of Anne, Lady Dacre, dated 1594. She was the daughter of Sir Richard Sackville by his wife Winifred, a daughter of Sir John Bruges (otherwise Brydges), Lord Mayor of London in 1520-21. Her brother was Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset. She married Gregory Fiennes of Herstmonceaux and Chelsea, 10th Baron Dacre, in November 1558. He died on 25 September 1594 and she followed him, dying on 14 May (buried 15 May) 1595. Her epitaph states: :Faeminei lux clara chori, pia, casta, pudica, aegis subsidium, pauperibusque decus. Lady Dacre wrote that one of the main aims of the Foundation should be \\"for the bringing up of children in virtue and good and laudable arts so that they might better live in time to come by their honest labour.\\" With Lady Dacre's benefaction in 1594, Emanuel Hospital (almshouses and school), as it was first called, began. The children wore long brown tunics, rather similar in cut to those still worn by pupils at Christ's Hospital. Thanks to the interest of Queen Elizabeth I, cousin to Lady Dacre, a charter was drawn up, and the school and almshouses were established on a site at Tothill Fields, Westminster. Mention is made of the Hospital and similar foundations in an undated letter written by Daniel Defoe, entitled A Scheme for a Royal Palace in the Place of White-Hall. In 1883, the school sought larger, newer buildings for the children; and the boy boarders, as they all then were, moved to the present buildings on the edge of Wandsworth Common. These had been established originally in the late 1850s as Royal Victoria Patriotic School for Boys, funded by the Royal Patriotic Fund, for children orphaned during the Crimean War; the building was designed by Henry Saxon Snell. A sister building some south, and now known as the Royal Victoria Patriotic Building, housed the Royal Victoria Patriotic School for Girls. = Headmasters and headmistresses = * The Rev. A.

He was ordained deacon in 1823, two years after the Greek Revolution and the massacres of 9 July. He served as deacon in Paphos diocese, later he served as deacon to Archbishop of Cyprus Panaretos and subsequent Archbishops, Ioannikios and Kyrillos I. He was ordained Archbishop on 26 August 1854 succeeding Kyrillos I who had died a month earlier. For his days, thanks to the Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856, he managed to rise and sound the bell for the first time in the Turkish-occupied Nicosia, in the cathedral of St. John. He made sure that the religious duties of the clergy were guaranteed, while he was the first Archbishop to gain the right to participate in the general board of the island. He repaired the Archbishop's building (1862‚Äì1863), rebuilt the Grand Synod and completed the final picture of the Archbishop's building complex until the changes that took place in the past century. Makarios was instrumental in the establishment of many schools throughout rural Cyprus to combat illiteracy. In 1857 he founded the Faneromeni School, the first school for girls on the island.

He was the nephew of the founding father of Bangladesh Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and founded the Mujib Bahini (Bangladesh Liberation Force-BLF) one of the major guerrilla forces of the Bangladesh Liberation War. He also founded the Jubo League, the youth wing of Bangladesh Awami League. Early life Sheikh Fazlul Haque Mani was born in Tungipara, Gopalganj District on December 4, 1939. He studied in Nabakumar Institution in Dhaka. Later, he studied at Jagannath College (HSC, 1958) and BM College (BA, 1960).  Political career  Mani was the founding chairman of the Jubo League. Later he served as general secretary of the then East Pakistan Chhatra League from 1960 to 1964. His contribution to spearhead the historic student movement against autocratic ruler Ayub Khan‚Äôs military regime produced an immense effect. He played a pivotal role during the six-point movement in 1966. He was a student leader and general secretary of Student League. In the first week of April 1971 he along with three other Awami League leaders escaped to Kolkata. The leaders were Tofael Ahmed, Abdur Razzak and Shirazul Alam Khan. They organized the Mukti Bahini in India to liberate Bangladesh. Mani and P. N. Banerji, then joint director of Research and Analysis Wing (east), set up the Mujib Bahini as a counterbalance to former East Pakistan army officers in the Mukti Bahini. Members of the Mujib Bahini would go on to form the Jatiya Rakkhi Bahini. He took part in the war of liberation in 1971 as the commander of the Bangladesh Liberation Front. He initially supported the formation of a revolutionary council instead of an interim government which was against the wishes of Tajuddin Ahmed. He eventually had to give up on that and the interim government was formed. He was considered part of the inner circle of President Mujibur and was seen as loyal to Mujibur. This was the reason given for his assassination. Mani was the author of several novels, one of which was later made into a film Obanchita. Journalism Mani was the founder of the daily newspaper \\"Dainik Banglar Bani\\". Death Mani, along with his wife Arzu Moni, was killed during the Assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in a military coup on August 15, 1975. He lived two kilometers away from Mujibur in Dhanmondi. The attack on his house was witnessed by Mahfuz Anam, who is the editor as well as the publisher of The Daily Star, whose house was on the opposite side of the lake from Mani's house. His two sons - Fazle Noor Taposh, now the mayor of Dhaka South City Corporation, and Sheikh Fazle Shams Parash, an academician by profession - survived the attack, as they were hiding under a bed. His wife, who was thought to be pregnant, was also killed. Taposh was three years and eight months old then, while Parash was around five years. Taposh was elected to the Jatiya Sangsad (National Parliament) in the 2008 Bangladeshi general election from the Dhaka-12 constituency. He was elected Mayor of DSCC in the 2020 Dhaka South City Corporation election. Parash currently holds the position of chairman of the Jubo League. Legacy The 'Shahid Sheikh Moni Memorial International Chess Tournament, which was held in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 2015,was named in his memory. An auditorium in Gopalganj, Bangladesh was named after him. =Criticism= Mani was given lucrative positions in the Government formed by Sheikh Mujibur. When private trade with India was banned to slow inflation, Fazlul Haque actively engaged in it with Mujibur's blessings. This was seen as an attempt by Mujibur to form a dynasty.

The earliest velociraptorines are probably Nuthetes from the United Kingdom, and possibly Deinonychus from North America. However, several indeterminate velociraptorines have also been discovered, dating to the Kimmeridgian stage, in the Late Jurassic Period. These fossils were discovered in the Langenberg quarry, Oker near Goslar, Germany.van der Lubbe, T., Richter, U. and Knotschke, N. (2009). \\"Velociraptorine dromaeosaurid teeth from the Kimmeridgian (Late Jurassic) of Germany.\\" Acta Palaeontologica Polonica, 54(3): 401-408. Description While most velociraptorines were generally small animals, at least one species may have achieved gigantic sizes comparable to those found among the dromaeosaurines. So far, this unnamed giant velociraptorine is known only from isolated teeth found on the Isle of Wight, England. The teeth belong to an animal the size of dromaeosaurines of the genus Utahraptor, but they appear to belong to a velociraptorine, judging by the shape of the teeth and the anatomy of their serrations.Naish, D. Hutt, and Martill, D.M. (2001). \\"Saurischian dinosaurs: theropods.\\" in Martill, D.M. and Naish, D. (eds). Dinosaurs of the Isle of Wight. The Palaeontological Association, Field Guides to Fossils. 10, 242‚Äì309. In 2007 paleontologists studied front limb bones of Velociraptor and discovered small bumps on the surface, known as quill knobs. The same feature is present in some bird bones, and represents the attachment point for strong secondary wing feathers. This finding provided the first direct evidence that velociraptorines, like all other maniraptorans, had feathers. =Distinguishing anatomical features= According to Currie (1995), Velociraptorinae can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: dromaeosaurids with maxillary and dentary teeth possessing denticles on the anterior carinae that are significantly smaller than the posterior denticles, and which have a second premaxillary tooth that is significantly larger than the third and fourth premaxillary teeth; dromaeosaurids with nasals that appear depressed, when observed in lateral view.Currie, P.J. 1995. New information on the anatomy and relationships of Dromaeosaurus albertensis (Dinosauria: Theropoda). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 15: 576‚Äì591. According to Turner et al. (2012), Velociraptorinae can be distinguished based on the following unambiguous characteristics: the posterior opening of the basisphenoid recess is divided into two small, circular foramina by a thin bar of bone; the dorsal tympanic recess is present as a deep, posterolaterally directed concavity; pleurocoels are present in all of the dorsal vertebrae. Classification Velociraptorine skeletons to scale When erected by Barsbold in 1983, Velociraptorinae was conceived as a group containing Velociraptor and supposed closely related species. Translated paper It was not until 1998 that this group was defined as a clade by Paul Sereno. Sereno defined the group as all dromaeosaurids more closely related to Velociraptor than to Dromaeosaurus. While several studies have since recovered a group of dromaeosaurids closely related to Velociraptor, they vary widely regarding which species are actually velociraptorines and which are either more basal or closer to Dromaeosaurus. Novas and Pol (2005) found a distinct velociraptorine clade close to the traditional view, which included Velociraptor, Deinonychus, and material that was later named Tsaagan. A cladistic analysis conducted by Turner et al. (2012) also supported a traditional, monophyletic of Velociraptorinae. However, some studies found a very different group of dromaeosaurids in velociraptorinae, such as Longrich and Currie (2009), which found Deinonychus to be a non-velociraptorine, non- dromaeosaurine eudromaeosaur, and Saurornitholestes to be a member of a more basal group they named Saurornitholestinae. A larger analysis in 2013 found some traditional velociraptorines, such as Tsaagan, to be more basal than Velociraptor, while others to be more closely related to Dromaeosaurus, making them dromaeosaurines. This study found Balaur, previously found to be a velociraptorine by most analyses, to be an avialan instead. The cladogram below follows a 2009 analysis by paleontologists Nicholas Longrich and Philip J. Currie, using a dataset of 114 characters scored for 23 taxa. The cladogram below follows a 2012 analysis by Turner, Makovicky and Norell, using a dataset of 474 characters scored for 111 taxa.

She was the mother of Louis the Child. By birth she was probably a member of the Conradine Dynasty. Life =Possible Conradine ancestry= Very little is known of Ota. She was probably born in Velden in 873/4. She is often thought to have been the daughter of Berengar, Count of Hesse and thus a member of the Conradine Dynasty.Werner, 'Nachkommen,' p. 456; Krah, 'Uta,' col. 1344. This view has been questioned by Donald Jackman, who has found no evidence that Ota was a member of the Conradines.Jackman, The Conradines, pp. 136-139. =Marriage to Arnulf of Carinthia= In 888, aged about sixteen, Ota married Arnulf of Carinthia, who was king of East Francia.Reuter, 'Sex, lies and oath-helpers,' pp. 219f. There is no evidence that Ota was crowned. If Ota was a Conradine, then the marriage was intended to win Arnulf support in Bavaria and Lorraine.Werner, 'Nachkommen,' p. 456. For the first few years of their marriage, the couple had no children together. Arnulf thus asked at an imperial assembly held at Forcheim that his two illegitimate sons, Zwentibold and Ratold, born to different mothers, should be recognised as his heirs. Yet in 893 Ota gave birth to Arnulf's legitimate heir, Louis the Child. She was not, as is sometimes conjectured, the mother of Glismut, the wife of Conrad the Elder: Glismut was the mother of Conrad I of Germany, who was born c. 890. Ota's name features in her husband's documents at the beginning and towards the end of his reign, when she intervened in privileges for the abbey of Kremsm√ºnster and the monastery of Alt√∂tting, and for the Bishopric of Worms and the Bishopric of Freising.Ota appears in the following diplomas: Die Urkunden Arnulfs, nos. 44, 107a, 143, 154, 170, 171, 176, 190; and Die Urkunden Ludwigs, nos. 12, 26, 28, 52. For discussion, see Reuter, 'Sex, lies and oath-helpers,' pp. 220ff. =Accusation of adultery= The most notable incident involving Ota occurred in June 899. According to the Annals of Fulda, she was accused of adultery: \\"Then a scandal, and worse, a crime, unheard of for many years, was published about Queen Ota; that she had yielded her body to a lustful and wicked union\\".Annales Fuldenses, p. 132 (in Latin); Annals of Fulda, p. 138 (in English). Ota was called to defend herself at an assembly in Regensburg. The accusation of adultery against a queen was not as \\"unheard of\\" as the Annals of Fulda suggest however: Richardis, wife of Charles the Fat, was accused of adultery just twelve years earlier. Ota (like Richardis before her) protested her innocence, and \\"cleared herself of the accusation [...] with the help of seventy-two oath-helpers before the judgement of the leading men who were present\\".Annales Fuldenses, p. 132 (in Latin); Annals of Fulda, pp. 138f. (in English). Arnulf was already ill when this accusation was made. In fact, it may be that the accusation of adultery was made because Arnulf was ill.Reuter, 'Sex, lies and oath-helpers,' pp. 224-230. =Decline and death= Arnulf died in late 899. Ota's son, Louis (aged six), became king after his father's death, but Ota was not involved in his regency. Louis was placed in the guardianship of Hatto I, Archbishop of Mainz, Bishop Adalbero of Augsburg, and several major nobles. Ota disappears from history; she is spoken of as dead by 903, and is believed to have withdrawn to the lands of her family. She bequeathed her property to the church. Ota was buried in St. Emmeram's Abbey in Regensburg. Notes References *T. Reuter, ‚ÄòSex, lies and oath- helpers: the trial of Queen Uota,‚Äô in idem, Medieval polities & modern mentalities, ed. J.L.

However, during the 1920s, Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. Amid these political upheavals, a rival association, the Football Association of Ireland, emerged in Dublin and from 1924 organised their own national team.

Biography  He studied theoretical physics with Hendrik Antoon Lorentz at University of Leiden. He subsequently carried out Ph.D. research under the supervision of Lorentz, concerning an application of the statistical mechanics of Gibbs to molecular problems. In 1914, he was appointed professor of physics, as successor of Peter Debye, at University of Utrecht. Among his doctoral students was Jan Frederik Schouten. In 1922, he became director of Physical Laboratory (Fysisch Laboratorium) and extended his research interests to experimental subjects. His precision measurements concerning intensities of spectral lines brought Physical Laboratory in the international limelight. He is also remembered for the Ornstein-Zernike theory (named after Ornstein and Frederik Zernike) concerning correlation functions,The Ornstein-Zernike equation and integral equations and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (named after Ornstein and George Uhlenbeck), a stochastic process.

Digital Library of Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. director of Philips Research Laboratories (Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium), he was the driving force behind establishing the Dutch Physical Society (Nederlands Natuurkundig Vereniging, NNV) in 1921. From 1939 until November 1940 he was Chairman of this Society. From 1918 until 1922 Ornstein was Chairman of the Dutch Zionist Society (Nederlandse Zionistische Vereniging). In 1929, he became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Immediately after the involvement of the Netherlands in the World War II (see Battle of the Netherlands), a friend from the United States of America, the astronomer Peter van de Kamp, offered to bring Ornstein and his family to America. However, Ornstein did not accept this offer, since, as he put it, he would not leave his laboratory in Utrecht. Owing to his Jewish heritage, Ornstein was summarily dismissed from the University in September, 1940. He was even barred from entering his own laboratory. In November, 1940, he was officially dismissed from the University. On November 29, 1940, Ornstein willingly withdrew his membership of the Dutch Physical Society. During this period he increasingly distanced himself from public life, to the degree that he no longer wished to receive guests at home. Ornstein died on May 20, 1941, six months after being barred from University. One of the five buildings of Department of Physics of University of Utrecht, the Ornstein Laboratorium,Ornstein Laboratorium is named in his honor.

Brandon said \\"We were fucking horrendous, but I think people liked us because they thought it was adorable, precocious or whatever.

The reason for a nuke is based on violations of the standards that must be followed. Pre network Pre network (aka Nukenet) is a collection of databases which share information about releases among the members of the network. There are approximately 20 different pre networks. Peers can be linked to more than one network. Linking to other network provides information which isn't available on peers local pre network. Such information can be .sfv, .m3u, .jpg, .diz or .nfo files. Pre database Each release that gets released will result as a record in a pre- database or dupe check. This record will at least contain the time the release was released and the release name (the name of the folder that contains the files of the release). The size and nature of the release are often provided too. Nukes are linked with their release in these databases when a nuke is issued. To check if a release is nuked, a scener uses an IRC channel to query the database by typing commands. These IRC channels are called pre channels and are often not accessible for the general public. The database is updated automatically through spidering topsites or by catching pre-release announcements from site channels. The purpose of these different worldwide and mirrored pre databases is to check for fakes and that for example a music album or movie isn't pred more than once and thus reducing traffic. = List of public predb websites = There are now several public websites and IRC channels that list the contents of pre-databases. Most of them are regularly updated and show nuke reasons next to their release. They can be regularly down, very slow when searching or disappeared entirely. The server time is shown on some of them. According to TorrentFreak these websites are \\"simple archives of information that cannot be claimed by copyright holders, but anti- piracy companies apparently cannot tell the difference between reporting news and offering pirate releases for download.\\" * https://predb.org/ * https://predb.pw/ * https://pre.corrupt-net.org/ or https://pr3.us/ - 7.5 million releases * https://predb.ovh/ - More than 9.4 million releases in the database. * https://predb.me/ - More than 7.9 million releases in the database. * http://www.d00per.com/ - Database started on 2009-09-16 and has 4.8 million records. * http://pre.c-burns.co.uk/pre.php - More than 3.1 million releases in the database. * IRC Server: irc.zenet.org port: +6697 * IRC Server: irc.zone-pre.info port: +6672 * IRC Server: us.puzzlepants.com port: +7000 * IRC Server: pool.xnuke.org Pre channel A pre channel is an IRC channel in which a prebot announces new warez (pre) releases in real time. Pre channels are generally provided as a convenience to members of the scene, often in conjunction with a topsite. Pre channels are typically private. Advantages: * Members of a pre channel are notified about new warez releases as they are released. This is of particular benefit to couriers and release groups. * Pre channels commonly announce when a release is nuked or un-nuked. * Pre channels provide a search facility that allows users to find out if a release exists, when it was released, and if it has been nuked. This function may also be used by release groups to avoid dupes (duplicates). * Pre channels are also used for topsites to measure how fast they received the release, otherwise known as the pretime. Disadvantages: * Pre channels are often supplied with events from other pre channels, so spam may spread quickly. Many prebots employ elaborate filters to ensure only valid release events are announced. Scener mentions bullshit nukes. * It just gives you the release name and no quality details, plot/features or links to downloads. = List of public IRC pre channels = * http://filenetworks.blogspot.com/2010/09/corrupt-net-new-p2p-friendly-irc.html * http://filenetworks.blogspot.com/2010/12/list-of-public-pre-trace-services- to.html * https://opentrackers.org/links/warez-scene/#rlsdb Prebot A prebot is commonly known as an automated script in IRC channels that announces new releases and can let users query its database to view past warez release dates and nukes, among other things.https://github.com/haaja/prebot Another kind of prebot was adopted in 2000 due to the increased competition among release groups. This prebot automatically distributed new releases to affiliated topsites of a group to release faster and more efficiently. This solved geographical and time zone related issues.

In 1963, they were voted the ninth most popular group in Liverpool by readers of Mersey Beat magazine from a competitive field of several dozen popular Liverpool bands of the time. Career They originally consisted of: *Terry Sylvester ‚Äî guitar/lead vocals (born Terence Sylvester, 8 January 1947, Allerton, Liverpool) *John Kinrade ‚Äî lead guitar/vocals (born John Knowles, 25 June 1946, Southport, Lancashire) *Mike Gregory ‚Äî bass guitar/vocals (born Michael Gregory, 7 November 1946, Liverpool Maternity Hospital, Kensington, Liverpool) *Ray Walker ‚Äî lead vocals *Johnny Foster ‚Äî drums; replaced by Pete Clarke (born Peter Gaskell, 1946); replaced by Kenny Goodlass from The Kirkbys; replaced by Pete Clarke; replaced by Tommy Kelly of Earl Preston's Realms; replaced by Paul Comerford of The Cryin' Shames. Terry Sylvester was replaced by Frank Townsend from The Easybeats (1962‚Äì65) and the Beachwoods, who was later to become a member of Tony Rivers and the Castaways. Paddy Chambers (ex- Faron's Flamingos and The Big Three) subsequently replaced Townsend. Sylvester left to join The Swinging Blue Jeans in 1966, before replacing Graham Nash in The Hollies. He now lives in Toronto and travels all over the United States and Canada playing concerts with artists such as Billy J. Kramer, Peter Noone, Joey Molland and other British Invasion acts. Sylvester also does a one-man show. Paul McCartney played tambourine on their last record, \\"From Head to Toe\\" in 1966. John Kinrade stopped playing after The Escorts split up in 1967, sold his Gretsch guitar and became a hairdresser with two salons. Mike Gregory would also leave The Escorts in 1967 to join The Swinging Blue Jeans, and stayed until 1973, whereupon after leaving and doing sessions for a couple of years, he formed a group with Johnny Goodison of the original Brotherhood of Man called Big John's Rock 'n' Roll Circus in 1975. Gregory stayed in 'The Circus' until its demise in 2005, and is now a solo artist. Drummer Pete Clarke managed to record a fine instrumental solo single in 1968. For a while that same year he became the in-house session drummer for Apple Music and is notable on a couple of songs on Jackie Lomax's album, Is This What You Want?. Still wanting to be in a group, in 1969 he joined the strange poetry band, The Liverpool Scene, and still working for Apple he did sessions for Kiki Dee and Billy Preston, and then did a brief stint in Badfinger. He is now living in the US. Although they never released a full album during their short time together, much later (1983) at the instigation of Elvis Costello, Edsel Records released an LP containing all twelve songs from the six singles. It was released on CD in 1995 as EDCD 422 and entitled From the Blue Angel, as a reference to the club [owned by Allan Williams, The Beatles' first manager] where The Escorts began performing in 1962. Costello also released a single which was a copy of The Escorts last recording, \\"From Head to Toe\\"/\\"Night Time\\".

It has a statutory role in England and Wales, and health departments in Scotland and Northern Ireland may choose to accept its advice.  History  The committee was established in 1963, having been until then an advisory board for polio immunisation. It gained statutory status as the Standing Advisory Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, a non- departmental public body advising the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Secretary of State for Wales, under the National Health Service (Standing Advisory Committees) Order 1981. Since the devolution of government powers to Wales, the JVCI continues to advise Welsh ministers. For England, the Health Protection (Vaccination) Regulations 2009 require the Secretary of State for Health to implement the committee's recommendations regarding national immunisation programmes. The committee has no statutory role in Scotland or Northern Ireland. Following the Government‚Äôs review of public bodies that completed in 2012, JCVI was reconstituted as a departmental expert committee, although its statutory status under the 1981 order continues. Roles and responsibilities The JCVI has a responsibility to provide high quality and considered advice and recommendations to the UK Health Ministers. This includes giving advice on recommendations on matters of both a 'routine' nature and also on any specific or special matters that Ministers may request. In formulating any advice and recommendations, the Committee must take into account the need for and impact of vaccines, the quality of vaccines and the strategies to ensure that their greatest benefit to the public health can be obtained from the most appropriate use of vaccines. JCVI members meet and report as one Committee, usually three times a year. Its recommendations, as accepted by the Secretaries of State, are published in \\"Immunisation against infectious diseases\\" and also through other routes as necessary (e.g., Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Letters). Membership The JCVI chairman is Professor Andrew Pollard of Oxford Vaccine Group in the Department of Paediatrics at the University of Oxford. The current members' names and affiliations are published online although year of appointment is not stated. According to the published code of practice appointments are normally of three years' duration. In accordance with the Code of Practice issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, members cannot serve on the Committee for more than 10 years. A previous chairman, Andrew Hall, was appointed Knight Bachelor in the 2013 Birthday Honours. Position on MMR The JCVI \\"expressed concern\\" about giving triple vaccines to children with a personal or family history of convulsions, but considered it appropriate to proceed with a planned introduction of the MMR vaccine in October 1988, including two products containing Urabe strain. After the start of the mass MMR immunisation programme, additional evidence that the strain was linked with viral meningitis surfaced in a number of countries, and by 1990, many had withdrawn products containing it. In November 1992, it was withdrawn in the UK, following the publication of government-sponsored research which confirmed a high incidence of transitory mild meningitis. Since that time, government agencies have acted to prevent the importation of single vaccines containing this strain. In 2001, Andrew Wakefield published what he said were his concerns in the Journal of Adverse Drug and Toxicological Reviews commenting on early studies of MMR, none of which were critical of the vaccine. The article was reviewed by the JCVI, which unequivocally rejected Wakefield's claims, with government agencies publishing a detailed rebuttal. In 2010, Wakefield was struck off by the General Medical Council for fabrication of results and failure to declare a financial interest in the importation of single strain vaccines. Position on thimerosal As is the case in the United States and many other countries, the mercury-based additive thimerosal, previously thought necessary for multi-dose vials of vaccines such as the DPT shot, has largely been phased out. According to the JCVI, it has been shown that the amount of mercury in the blood of children receiving thimerosal- containing vaccines is well below levels that may be \\"associated with any toxic effects.\\" Reports reviewed by the JCVI contended that mercury exposure in the UK immunisation programme was low. However, in 2001, JCVI endorsed recommendations to remove the preservative, stating: \\"even though there is no evidence of toxicity, as a precautionary measure, thiomersal should be phased out over time...\\".

Overview Levine, who was Jewish and from Brooklyn, was a legitimate contender who flattened 36 opponents with his devastating left hook. At 5' 8\\", he was a right handed slugger, with an orthodox fighting style. His left hook made him a fighter who no one looked forward to facing in the ring. He was trained by Charley Goldman, the fabled trainer of boxing legend Rocky Marciano. From 1941‚Äì42, Levine fought twenty-seven times with only two losses, and won by knockout an impressive seventeen times. Levine vs. Robinson  On November 6, 1946, Levine challenged Sugar Ray Robinson at the Arena in Cleveland, Ohio. Barely able to rise from a nine count in the fifth, Robinson later claimed Levine hit him with the hardest punch of his career, a powerful left hook to the jaw. The referee held up the fight after Robinson was down, and walked Levine to his corner, and then resumed the count, giving Robinson as much as seventeen seconds to recover, an act which may have prevented Levine from immediately following up and ending the fight. After clinching for the remainder of the round to recover, Robinson came back and knocked out Levine in the tenth round after a paralyzing blow to the solar plexus allowed him to follow up with rapid blows to the head and body that put Levine down for the full count. It was the first time Levine had been knocked out in 60 fights, and nearly the only knockdown and possibly knockout in Robinson's impressive career.Schlemmer, Jim, \\"Tenth Round Punches End Torrid Bout\\", The Akron Beacon Journal, Akron, Ohio, pg. 35, 7 November 1946 On March 11, 1946, Levine matched skills with Jimmy Doyle in Cleveland, Ohio, defeating him in a ninth round knock out. Levine later told a reporter that Doyle nearly died in the ring as the result of the blows he received and required a respirator to stay alive. Doyle died a year later in a fight with Sugar Ray Robinson. Levine claimed the experience affected his aggressiveness in the ring, and reduced his desire to stay with boxing as a career.Bodner, Allen, When Boxing Was a Jewish Sport, (1997) Praeger Publishing, Wesport, Connecticut, pg. 114-115, 156 In March 1947, Levine met Herbie Kronowitz of Brooklyn winning a ten-round unanimous decision in the main event at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The crowd of 12,000 was said to have been enthralled during the entire battle between the two fighters. Kronowitz always claimed that he really defeated Levine in the confrontation. Experiencing a decline, he lost to Billy Fox at Madison Square Garden in a third-round technical knockout on June 27, 1947. Fox had been nearly knocked out in the second round, but came back to send Levine to the mat in the third before the referee ended the bout. Life after boxing After losses to Chuck Hunter and Dick Wagner, Levine retired in 1949 at only 24, feeling disillusioned and disgusted by the criminal element he felt had taken over his career. Using his ambition and intellect, he owned a meat business, started a local teamsters union and became a successful sales manager at Volkswagen, one of America's largest car dealerships. He died on January 13, 2012 at the age of 86 in Matthews, North Carolina, and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.

The Dregs are a comedy folk band of six performers based in the Twin Cities region of Minnesota. Live performances are partially improvised. They perform around the Midwest and have recorded eight albums. History The Dregs began as an a cappella group formed by improv comedian and bodhr√°n drummer Tim Wick at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival in 2001 under the moniker \\"Pub Kin\\". It consisted loosely of over a dozen members who were meant to serve drinks and entertain patrons of Mac's Pub, a vacant merchant shop turned ale house with an Irish theme. In practice, it became problematic for performers to operate the pub on their own, so tending bar became the responsibility of the Minnesota Jaycees, and Pub Kin was reduced to purely a music act. In 2002, the band was pared down to just five members and added elements of improv comedy to their performances. Soon thereafter, the band began making public appearance at venues outside of the Minnesota Renaissance Festival. The Dregs released their first album \\"Are You Gonna Drink That?\\" in 2003, consisting of traditional Irish ballads, silly drinking tunes, and bawdy songs. Expanding beyond a cappella, the album included several songs with accompaniment by guitarist Sean Larson. Impressed with the musical talents of their recording engineer, The Dregs asked Chad Dutton to join the act. In 2005 they released another full-length album \\"Our Drunk Goes to Eleven\\" and the CD Single \\"Johnny Jump-Up\\". Half of the cast stepped down from The Dregs in late 2005 and were soon replaced by Rachael Salisbury, Frost Simula, and Angelina Lais. To highlight the new talent, the band released a live album, \\"Uncorked,\\" in 2007, and another studio album \\"Thank You, Sir. May I Have Another?\\" just a year later in 2008. By this time, the band had established itself as a local comedy and music act with several bars, music venues, conventions, and private events in the Minneapolis/St. Paul metropolitan area, as well as additional Renaissance faires in the Midwest. Vocalist and comedian Angelia Lais departed from the act following The Dregs Holiday Special performance in December 2009. Interested in expanding instrumentation, mezzo-soprano and violinist (and occasional violist/mandolin player) Molly Zupon was recruited in early 2010. Frost Simula left the band at the end of 2011 at which time Geoffrey M. Brown, who had been participating with The Dregs throughout 2011, joined the group as the guitarist. The Dregs released their seventh album \\"Do It Like You're Drunk\\" in 2012. In 2013, The Dregs took their comedy show to the Minnesota Fringe Festival in a tongue and cheek one-act called 'A Brief History of Irish Music'. Also in 2013, they collaborated with fellow local Irish band Four Pints Shy on live recording, \\"2 Bands 1 Show\\". Geoffrey Brown left The Dregs in 2015 to pursue other artistic ventures, and Paul Score joined The Dregs as the guitarist in 2016. In 2017, Chad Dutton left the band, and djembe player and accordionist Trevor Hartman joined. Trevor and Paul bring with them years of experience and camaraderie as they performed together in the Renaissance Festival band 'Folk Underground', which opened for Minnesota Renaissance iconic comedy group Puke and Snot. The Dregs continue to play at the Minnesota Renaissance Festival at Mac's Pub. Popularity The Dregs have been featured most prominently at their birthplace, the Minnesota Renaissance Festival. They make nearly a dozen appearances per day, costumed and acting as a peasant Irish band, and are still a mainstay at Mac's Pub. Similar performances have been at the Siouxland Renaissance Festival in Sioux Falls, SD, Riverssance Festival in Sioux City, Iowa, and at the Olde World Renaissance Faire in Twig, MN. While music is a vehicle for their comedy, The Dregs main draw is a combination of their stage antics and their ridiculous lyrics. Themes which garner the most attention are songs about science fiction, rednecks, chickens, and zombies. To date, their most popular song is the apocalyptic undead ballad \\"Zombies in the Shire\\", featured on the album \\"Thank You, Sir.

History Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as \\"Sarah Kathryn Sturm\\" on January 23, 1909, she was a daughter of Harry and Sarah E. Sturm. As a toddler, she resided with her parents at the home of her paternal grandparents, Henry and Lotta Sturm, in Pittsburgh's 11th ward, where her father and grandfather were both hardware merchants and her paternal aunt was a school teacher.\\"Sturm, Sarah K.

Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. A decade later, she and her five-year-old brother, Raymond, were living with their parents at their own home in Pittsburgh's 10th ward. Her father was employed that year as a laundry superintendent.\\"Sturm, Sarah C. [aka Sallary Starr , Harry W., Sarah E. [Sally Starr's mother], and Raymond,\\" in U.S. Census (1920). Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. While on a summer break from her studies at Pittsburgh's Peabody High School, she was sent to New York by her parents to visit her maternal grandmother, Mrs. Emma Imhoff, and was noticed as she spontaneously danced in the wings to the music of a Ted Lewis show rehearsal, having been invited to that rehearsal by a friend. Recruited by the show's director, she was subsequently chaperoned by her grandmother, who accompanied her as she toured with the Lewis show chorus. Freqeuently compared to Clara Bow, Sturm made her debut in Lewis' Frolics, and then also appeared in George White's Scandals of 1924. After making her move to Hollywood, she signed a contract with MGM.Cloud, \\"Comeback at Craft Avenue,\\" The Pittsburgh Press. While in Hollywood, she became better known as \\"Sally Starr,\\" and performed leading roles in So This Is College (1929), The Woman Racket (1930), Not So Dumb (1930), Personality (1930), Pardon My Gun (1930) and For The Love o' Lil (1930). Starr was signed among the cast of Swing High (1930), a production of Pathe Pictures. Starr also continued her theatrical work after her motion picture career began, performing with Eleanor Powell and George Hassell in The Optimists, staged at the Century Roof Theater in January 1928. The same year she was cast with Elliott Nugent, Robert Montgomery, and Phyllis Crane in So This Is College. Her final films are Meet The Bride (1937), Getting An Eyeful (1938), Love and Onions (1938), and Money on Your Life (1938). In 1958, Starr returned to the stage, performing in Bemardine at the Pittsburgh Playhouse in June of that year.Cloud, \\"Comeback at Craft Avenue,\\" The Pittsburgh Press.

Aster ericoides), known as white heath aster, frost aster, or heath aster, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae, native to much of central and eastern North America. It has also been introduced to parts of Europe and western Asia. Taxonomy Heath aster has two varieties: Symphyotrichum ericoides var. ericoides, which spreads by underground rhizomes to form colonies, and S. ericoides var. pansum, which is cespitose, remaining in a clump, and has corm-like caudices. Description Heath aster is an herbaceous perennial with stems from tall. Its leaves are sessile (stalkless) and narrow, becoming smaller towards the top of the plant and tips of the branching stem. It has white (rarely pinkish), composite flowerheads with yellow centers that begin flowering in late summer through fall. They are rather small, across. It is commonly confused with Symphyotrichum pilosum, which co-occurs throughout most of its range. S. pilosum has larger flowerheads with longer ray petals. The phyllaries on S. pilosum are spine-tipped, while those of S. ericoides are not (although the curled edges may make them appear to be). Distribution Heath aster grows from Canada across much of the United States into the Mexican states of Coahuila and Nuevo Le√≥n. The variety S. ericoides var. ericoides prefers open locations with sandy, gravelly, or disturbed soil. Cultivation Confusingly, plants sold in the horticultural trade labeled as Aster ericoides, the old name of the plant, are almost invariably cultivars or hybrids involving the species Symphyotrichum dumosum, S. lateriflorum, S. pilosum or S. racemosum, a mistake that has apparently occurred continuously since the 19th century. Asters are tough plants, though they can be subject to fungal infections, especially if not planted in open, sunny conditions where the soil is not too damp. They are valued in the garden for providing late season flower colour in shades of blue, pink and white. The following cultivars of A. ericoides have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: * 'Blue Star' * 'Brimstone' * f. prostratus 'Snow flurry' * 'Golden Spray' * 'Pink Cloud' * 'Ringdove' References ericoides Category:Flora of North America Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ","title":"Symphyotrichum ericoides"},{"id":"9878102","text":"bow shock near the boat's initial interface with the water, and a rooster tail directly behind the boat A rooster tail is a term used in fluid dynamics, automotive gear shifting, and meteorology. In fluid dynamics, it lies directly in the wake of an object traveling within a fluid, and is accompanied by a vertical protrusion. If it occurs in a river, boaters upstream steer clear of their appearance. The degree of their formation can indicate the efficiency of a boat's hull design. The magnitude of these features in a boat increases with speed, while the relationship is inversely proportional for airplanes. Energetic volcanic eruptions can create rooster tail formations from their ejecta. They can form in relation to coronal loops near the sun's surface. In gear shifting, it is the relation between the coefficient of friction and the sliding speed of the clutch. Cars can throw rooster tails in their wake and loose materials are under its wheels. In meteorology, a rooster tail satellite pattern can be applied to either low or high level cloudiness, with the low cloud line seen in the wake of tropical cyclones and the high cloud pattern seen either within mare's tails or within the outflow jet of tropical cyclones. In fluid dynamics Apollo 16 Commander John Young drives Lunar Rover 002 Rooster tails are caused by constructive interference near and to the wake of objects within a flowing fluid. =Related to water= A fast current of water flowing over a rock near the surface of a stream or river can create a rooster tail‚Äîsuch commotion at the water's surface are avoided by boaters due to the near surface obstruction. Propellers on boats can produce a rooster tail of water in their wake, in the form of a fountain which shoots into the air behind the boat. The faster a boat goes, the larger the rooster tails become. The efficiency of a boat's hull design can be determined by the magnitude of the rooster tail‚Äîlarger rooster tails indicate less efficient designs. If a water skier is in tow, the skis also throw off a rooster tail. Airplanes lifting off from a lake produce lengthening rooster tails behind their amphibious floats with speed until the plane lifts off the surface. =Related to air= Airplanes leave rooster tails in its wake in the form of two circulations of the tip of its wings. As the plane speeds up, the rooster tails become smaller. =Related to rock= Rooster tail caused by a stromboli eruption In low gravity and dusty environments, such as the Moon, they can be created by the wheels of moving vehicles. A special energetic volcanic eruption known as a strombolian eruption produces bright arcs of ejecta, referred to as rooster tails, composed of basaltic cinders or volcanic ash. =Near the sun= Coronal loops are the basic structures of the magnetic solar corona, the bright area seen around the sun during solar eclipses. These loops are the closed-magnetic flux cousins of the open-magnetic flux that can be found in coronal hole (polar) regions and the solar wind. Loops of magnetic flux well-up from the solar body and fill with hot solar plasma. Due to the heightened magnetic activity in these coronal loop regions, coronal loops can often be the precursor to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Emerging magnetic flux within coronal loops can cause a rooster tail. In relation to cars The curve describing the relationship between the coefficient of friction and sliding speed of the clutch in manual transmission automobiles on a graph is known as a rooster tail characteristic. Formations can occur when a car's motor revs up over puddles, loose soil, or mud. In meteorology Tropical Storm Pablo (1995) displays a rooster tail in its eastern quadrant. Note the milky area to its east, which contains African dust Rooster tails have been mentioned in weather satellite interpretation since 2003 connected with tropical cyclones. In the low cloud field, it represents a convergence zone on the westward extent of the Saharan Air Layer seen on the backside of tropical cyclones gaining latitude. If there are two systems, the more poleward systems strengthens while the more equatorward system weakens within an area with downward motion in the mid-levels of the troposphere. This description has also been used with high cloudiness spreading in a narrow channel equatorward within the outflow jet of a tropical cyclone, such as Hurricane Felix (1995). Mare's tail patterns within cirrus clouds are occasionally referred to by this term due to their appearance.

Equality Colony was a United States socialist colony founded in Skagit County, Washington by a political organization known as the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth in the year 1897. It was meant to serve as a model which would convert the rest of Washington and later the entire continent to socialism.  Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth  The Equality Colony, circa 1900. = Origins = The colony's origins lay in ideas of New England reformers in the mid-1890s. Norman Wallace Lermond, a journalist and farmer in Warren, Maine, and Ed Pelton had been intrigued by an idea originally suggested by Socialist Labor Party member F.G.R. Gordon that a series of socialist colonies be established in a single western state. (Gordan suggested Texas.) Lermond and Pelton started a vigorous letter-writing campaign to notable reformers such as Henry Demarest Lloyd advocating the plan and suggesting that the socialist colonists would be able to initiate the collective ownership of the means of production in the state by voting in a socialist government. Lermond envisioned an organization of many local unions (\\"L.U.s\\") that would provide the colonists with financial, material, and moral support, coordinated by a national \\"center or union\\" controlled by seven trustees. His immediate model was the New England Emigrant Aid Company, which colonized Kansas with abolitionists prior to the U.S. Civil War in order to make the territory a free state. Lloyd gave the plan modest financial backing. Lermond started the first local union in Warren on October 18, 1895, and Pelton established the second in Damariscotta Mills, Maine that winter. In December 1895, Lermond issued a call for the creation of more local unions in the pages of the New York Commonwealth and the Coming Nation. In the spring of that year he announced he was setting up an \\"organizational meeting\\" to create a \\"National Union of the Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth\\" scheduled to be held in St. Louis on July 24‚Äì26, 1896, congruent with that year's People's Party national convention, to which he was a delegate. A formal \\"call\\" for this convention was published in Coming Nation July 11 and 18, and was endorsed by Henry Demarest Lloyd, Eugene Debs, Frank Parsons, William D. P. Bliss and Eltweed Pomeroy. = Organization = This convention, however, did not materialize. Lermond could not get away from the Populist convention, and Imogene Fales attended a National Cooperative Congress that created a new American Cooperative union with her as secretary. The Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth was officially organized through a mail referendum conducted through the Coming Nation, which was quickly becoming the movement's semi-official newspaper. On September 19, the Coming Nation announced the adoption of a constitution and the election of seven officers: Lloyd as president, Lermond as secretary, B. Franklin Hunter as treasurer, Frank Parsons dean, Morrison I. Swift organizer, I. E. Dean master workman and A. S. Edwards, of the Coming Nation editor. Nameplate of Industrial Freedom, newspaper of the Equality Colony published at Edison, Washington from 1898 through 1902. The constitution's preamble committed the organization to three broad goals: \\"1. To educate the people in the principles of Socialism; 2. To unite all socialists in one fraternal association; 3. To establish cooperative colonies and industries in one state until that state is socialized.\\" Each of the eight elected trustees would head a department of the organization. The president would theoretically head an executive department to generally supervise the group, but the most important position was secretary, which would head the colonization department charged with planting socialistic colonies. There were also departments for education (headed by the dean), organization, which would create new local unions, exchange, industry (headed by the Master Workman) and finance. Not all of these positions were filled, however. Lloyd and Hunter declined their positions, and the post of distributor was apparently unfilled. In new elections held in January 1897, radical minister Myron Reed was elected president and an attempt made to draft Eugene V. Debs by electing him national organizer. However, Debs was at the time a fledgling socialist preoccupied with miners' union strikes in the Mountain West and never served in an active capacity as the BCC's organizer. Debs nevertheless warmed up to the idea of colonizing a relatively unpopulated western state and making use of the ballot box to win control of state government and maintained close contact with the organization, meeting with Lermond in Terre Haute on May 24 to discuss possible unification of his American Railway Union with the BCC at convention scheduled three weeks later.\\"Plan to Redeem Toil,\\" Chicago Record, vol. 17, no. 124 (May 25, 1897), pg. 1. Meanwhile, Victor Berger and his group were urging him to create a new socialist organization committed to political action and not colonization. Lermond, Parsons and Reed attended the June 1897 convention of the ARU which created the Social Democracy of America, but the BCC did not join the new organization, rejecting its \\"class struggle\\" thesis with a vision of a colony that would include middle-class professionals and \\"everybody who believes in cooperation\\" and not just \\"the laboring classes so called\\". Weakened by the loss of Debs and the defection of some of its membership to the new SDA, the BCC set out to start its first colony.  Equality colony  = Plans = Logo of Equality Colony, 1898. By mid-1897 the BCC had about 2200 members in 130 local unions. After short tours in Tennessee and Arkansas, Lermond announced that August that Washington would be the most likely state for colonization. The southern states were already well settled and faced the \\"Negro question\\", while Washington had a small, sparse population with liberal inclinations and a Populist governor who was rumored to be sympathetic to the BCC. There were also a number of local unions already in the state, seven of which had sites available. On September 1, 1897 G.E. \\"Ed\\" Pelton left Maine for the Pacific Northwest to secure land for the colony. After visiting several sites, on October 15 he made a down payment of $100 to Mathias Decker, a conservative Skagit County farmer, for of land in Blanchard, Washington located 2 miles northeast of the hamlet of Edison.H.W. Halladay, \\"Equality Colony: A Brief History Showing Our Objects and Present Condition ‚Äî Cooperative Colonies Are Not All Failures,\\" Industrial Freedom [Equality, WA], New Series no. 9 (Nov. 1, 1901), pg. 1 Additional purchases and contributions were made until the colony reached an area of by the summer of 1898. = Settlement = The first fifteen settlers arrived on November 1, 1897 and named the colony \\"Equality\\" after Edward Bellamy's new book. By the time that the national board, their families and others arrived in March, the first building, Fort Bellamy, was finished and several others were in progress. However most members of the BCC board stayed in nearby Edison, where they leased a \\"national headquarters\\" for the brotherhood. By that summer membership had reached 3,000 members and 18 states had organizers. Through the organization department and the group's newspaper, Industrial Freedom (which began in May), the Brotherhood maintained its \\"national character\\". Appeal to Reason writer George Boomer (1862-1915) was among the editors of Industrial Freedom, the weekly newspaper of Equality Colony. However, dissension developed between the colonists at Equality and the BCC leaders at Edison. The colonists resented that their money was being used to keep the administration in town, while they lived in the crude, unfinished buildings at the colony site. They also objected to the administration's emphasis on the creation of a national organization and other colonies, feeling that the more immediate goal should be the completion of Equality. In early April, at a contentious meeting of the two factions, a plan to start an additional colony at Edison of the administrators was defeated and the Equality colonists proposed an amendment giving the colony complete independence in internal affairs, which passed by a vote of 298 to 176. August Lermond resigned from the BCC and returned to Maine, where he founded a new group, the Industrial Brotherhood. By the end of the year, most of the board members had left. In January 1899, a new slate of officers favored by the colonists was elected, and that February BCC headquarters was moved to Equality. From that point membership in the BCC fell to nearly 300, material support and new members from the outside dried up and Industrial Freedom circulation plummeted. The Brotherhood of the Cooperative Commonwealth as an organization was subsumed by Equality.While lip service was given to the idea of planting new colonies and socializing Washington for the next few years little was actually done toward those objectives and were eventually forgotten. The colony flourished for a few years, building two large apartments, a barn, a dining room and kitchen, a school house, a public hall, a store room, a printing office, a saw mill, a root house, a blacksmith and copper shop, an apiary, a bakery, a cereal and coffee house, and a milk house. Its population fluctuated, but was about 100 by the spring of 1903, when only the \\"die hards\\" remained. Harry Ault, who would later play a role in the Seattle general strike of 1919 as editor as the Seattle Union Record, arrived with his family at age 14 in April 1898 and began to learn journalism and printing by working on Industrial Freedom. He eventually became its editor, until the publication folded in December 1902. He also started Young Socialist in 1899 for the colony's children. In 1900 and 1901 some colonists left Equality to found a new community on Whidbey Island called the Free Land Association, or Freeland. This colony should not be confused with Equality in its later stages which was sometimes referred to as Freeland Colony.  Freeland  In autumn 1904 the colony was visited by Alexander Horr, a proponent of Theodor Hertzka‚Äôs \\"Freeland\\" concept. He returned next year with more of his followers and soon the colony's population grew by 30%. By the summer of 1905 Horr was able to change the BCCs constitution drastically to adhere to the Freeland concept. A new \\"local union\\" was established in New York, and five others in the near vicinity. The changes were not appreciated by the colony's older residents who started to resist the conversion of the colony to the new scheme in late 1905 and the colony became bitterly divided between the two factions, sometimes resulting in violence. The final factor in the demise of the colony occurred February 6, 1906, when an unknown person or group of people set fire to several buildings at night. The worst loss was the barn, which burned completely to the ground, killing most of the colony's cattle. The perpetrator was never identified, but each factions blamed the other for the arson. A suit was filed in Skagit County to dissolve the colony and the BCC went into receivership; its history ended when its land was sold for $12,500 to John J. Peth on June 1, 1907. A few families stayed in the area on plots of land that they owned individually.

They are also known as \\"wars between princes\\". Such wars involved small armies, officer corps from the nobility, the use of mercenaries, limited war goals, and frequently changing coalitions among the belligerents. In contrast with preceding wars of religion and 20th century total wars or revolutionary people's wars, cabinet wars had limited goals. The German term Kabinettskriege plays on Kabinettsregierung (Cabinet government), Kabinettsjustiz (Cabinet law), etc. The Thirty Years' War, based on religious conflict, had been marked by plundering and marauding armies. Order was reestablished by the 1648 Treaty of Westphalia, which formulated the rules of international relations which held force for centuries, in particular in respect to the laws of war (jus ad bellum and jus in bello). During the Age of Enlightenment and under the direction of the \\"enlightened despots,\\" wars became more regulated. Civilian populations were still affected, but incidents such as the 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day massacre became exceptional. Thus Berlin was not plundered during the Seven Years' War of 1756‚Äì1762, despite having fallen into enemy hands not once but twice. Cabinet wars, which mostly took place between 1650 and 1792, included: *the Ottoman wars, *the War of Devolution (1667-1668), *the Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678), *the War of the Reunions (1683-1684), *the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697), *the Great Northern War (1700-1721), *the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-1714), *the War of the Polish Succession (1733-1735), *the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748), *the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), and *the War of the Bavarian Succession (1778-1779) The development of the lev√©e en masse (mass conscription) during the French Revolution put an end to cabinet wars. Later wars were not simply due to conflicts between princes, but involved nationalism and conflicts over the boundaries of nation-states. Thus, the Peninsular War was called the War of Independence by the Spanish; this conflict also led to the first guerrilla warfare, against the regular Napoleonic army. A bit later, Napoleon's invasion of Russia, called the Patriotic War in Russian historiography, also sparked considerable guerrilla warfare. The Crimean War (1854-1856), on the other hand, may be regarded as a cabinet war, as it was conducted with limited goals and released only moderate passions from the people of the involved belligerent states.

The user credentials are typically some form of \\"username\\" and a matching \\"password\\", and these credentials themselves are sometimes referred to as a login (or a logon or a sign-in or a sign-on).Oxford Dictionaries, definition of login.The Linux Information Project, detail and definition of login and logging in. In practice, modern secure systems often require a second factor such as email or SMS confirmation for extra security. When access is no longer needed, the user can log out (log off, sign out or sign off). Procedure Finger print login, a recent banking security application Logging in is usually used to enter a specific page, website or application, which trespassers cannot see. Once the user is logged in, the login token may be used to track what actions the user has taken while connected to the site. Logging out may be performed explicitly by the user taking some actions, such as entering the appropriate command or clicking a website link label as such. It can also be done implicitly, such as by the user powering off his or her workstation, closing a web browser window, leaving a website, or not refreshing a website within a defined period. In the case of websites that use cookies to track sessions, when the user logs out, session-only cookies from that site will usually be deleted from the user's computer. In addition, the server invalidates any associations with the session, thereby making any session-handle in the user's cookie store useless. This feature comes in handy if the user is using a public computer or a computer that is using a public wireless connection. As a security precaution, one should not rely on implicit means of logging out of a system, especially not on a public computer; instead, one should explicitly log out and wait for the confirmation that this request has taken place. Logging out of a computer, when leaving it, is a common security practice preventing unauthorised users from tampering with it. There are also people who choose to have a password- protected screensaver set to activate after some period of inactivity, thereby requiring the user to re-enter his or her login credentials to unlock the screensaver and gain access to the system.

Early home computers and personal computers did not generally require them until Windows NT, OS/2 and Linux in the 1990s. The noun login comes from the verb (to) log in and by analogy with the verb to clock in. Computer systems keep a log of users' access to the system. The term \\"log\\" comes from the chip log historically used to record distance travelled at sea and was recorded in a ship's log or log book. To sign in connotes the same idea, but it's based on the analogy of manually signing a log book or visitors book.

He is best known as founder and publisher of PM, a short-lived 1940s New York City left-wing daily newspaper that refused to accept advertising. Biography Ingersoll went to Hotchkiss School, graduated from Yale University's Sheffield Scientific School and became a mining engineer in California, Arizona and Mexico. In 1923 he went to New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He worked as a reporter for the New York American from 1923 to 1925, and then joined The New Yorker where he was managing editor from 1925 to 1930. He had been hired by the New Yorker founder and editor Harold Ross a few months after the magazine commenced publication; Ross inadvertently spilled an inkwell on Ingersoll's new light suit (various sources claim it was either white or pale gray) during the job interview, then, in embarrassment, offered him the job. As Ingersoll left his office, he heard Ross mumble to his secretary: \\"Jesus Christ, I hire anybody.\\" According to his biographer, Roy Hoopes, Ingersoll \\"was one of the original guiding spirits of The New Yorker. He held it together during its first five years.\\" In 1930 Ingersoll went to Time Inc. as managing editor of Time-Life publications, and devised the formula of business magazine Fortune, eventually becoming general manager of the company. One of his most important assignments at Fortune was a detailed history of The New Yorker and its business. The scrutiny that Ingersoll gave Ross and his employees, which included mention of their foibles and salaries, initiated a feud between Ross and Henry Luce, publisher of Time and Fortune, culminating in a famed profile of Luce by Wolcott Gibbs that ran in The New Yorker in 1936, which lampooned both Luce and \\"Timestyle\\", the inverted writing style for which Time was (in)famous. Luce retaliated by having caricaturist Al Hirschfeld draw an image of Joseph Stalin over a picture of Ross.Kunkel (1995). pp. 203-204, 294 PM started on June 18, 1940 with $1.5 million of capital, a fraction of the $10 million that Ingersoll initially sought. Unlike in usual U.S. practice, PM ran no advertising, and editorials did not appear every day; when they did, they were signed by an individual, initially Ingersoll himself, instead of anonymously coming from the paper itself. Sometimes these editorials took over the front page. His first editorial took a forthright stand on World War II which was already under way in Europe: \\"We are against people who push other people around,\\" he wrote, demanding material U.S. support for the nations opposing Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. Ingersoll visited Britain in October and wrote a series for the paper that was published as an instant book fixup. The papers' first year was an overall success, although the paper was in some financial trouble: its circulation of 100,000‚Äì200,000 was insufficient. Marshall Field III had become the paper's funder; quite unusually, he was a \\"silent partner\\" in this continually money-losing undertaking. The 41-year-old Ingersoll was drafted into the military; when he returned after the war, he found a paper that was less lively and well-written than it had been under his leadership, and with the pro-communist and anti-communist liberals writing at cross purposes. The paper never quite recovered and ceased publication in 1948, an early victim of the Cold War (and of Field's increasing interest in the Chicago Sun rather than PM). Ingersoll later wrote numerous books about his service in World War II. It has recently been suggested, based on research, that Ingersoll may have been the originator, chief advocate and mission planner of the tactical deception unit formed by the US Army during the war and deployed in the European Theater of Operations known formally as the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops and colloquially as the Ghost Army of World War II. In the 1950s Ingersoll acquired and managed several newspapers. His company, Ingersoll Publications, founded in 1957, was taken over by his son Ralph M. Ingersoll Jr. in 1982 after he had bought his father out in a deal that left them no longer on speaking terms.

The district serves students in kindergarten through grade 12 with 29 elementary schools (free, full-day kindergarten through grade six), one K-8 school, seven middle schools (grades seven and eight), five high schools (grades nine through 12), two alternative schools and a K-12 online school, PVOnline. The district offers a variety of education choice programs, including K-12 International Baccalaureate, AVID, Core Knowledge, S.T.E.M. (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), CREST (Center for Research, Engineering, Science and Technology), Digital Learning Center, fine arts, The North Valley Arts Academies, career & technical education, Advanced Placement, before- after- school programs, sports and extracurricular activities for all ages. The district also provides gifted and special education programs. The district is located in 98-square miles of northeast Phoenix and a portion of north Scottsdale. This area extends from 7th Avenue to Pima Road and is generally bordered on the south by Northern Avenue and the north by Jomax Road. With 32,000 students, it is the seventh-largest school district in Arizona.  History  In 1913, local residents opened Sunnyside School on Cactus Road east of 32nd Street. The one-room schoolhouse, which served 21 girls and 13 boys its first year, was the predecessor to the Paradise Valley School District. In 1918, the school moved to a barn located at 32nd Street and Greenway. The building had a wood-burning stove and no indoor plumbing but had an outdoor facility. Due to failure to secure irrigation rights, many families left the area in the 1920s, , resulting in no record of school from 1920 to 1923. In 1930, Edwin Nesbet donated land for a new campus for Sunnyside. Sunnyside continued to be the solo school for the district until the late 1940s, when electricity was made available in the area. Paradise Valley High School was constructed in 1957, which eliminated the need for 10th grade students to attend the Phoenix Union High School. That same year, Paradise Valley High School District was formed. To prepare for growth, the district constructed four new schools in the 1960s, thirteen in the 1970s, eleven in the 1980s, ten in the 1990s and nine more since 2000 as of 2020. In July 1976, the separate high school and elementary school districts combined to form the Paradise Valley Unified School District. In 1991, the 1930s Sunnyside campus, which had been expanded in the 1950s, was replaced with Greenway Middle School.

Several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka. The region was popularly referred to as 'kar nata‚Äô literally meaning black soiled county in Indian history. However, historically, the names Karnatak or Carnatic have been misapplied to refer to the regions in or beyond the Western Ghats (Kodagu and Kerala) as well as to a region in present-day Andhra Pradesh (Telangana).Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 9, page 302 - Imperial Gazetteer of India - Digital South Asia Library The other accepted derivative comes from the Kannada words karu and nƒÅdu meaning elevated land, or from the Kannada words kal and nƒÅdu meaning rock country, referring to the rocky terrain of the state. One more derivative is \\"Karnad\\" meaning \\"land of Black soil\\" and other derivative is from Tamil words meaning that 'Karai' (‡Æï‡Æ∞‡Øà) meaning 'shore' and 'nataka' (‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æü‡Æï) meaning dance. References from Hindu texts The earliest known references to Karnataka are found in the Sabha Parva and the Bhishma Parva of Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic. The Matsya Purana, Skanda Purana, Markandeya Purana and the Bhagavata Purana also make references to the name Karnata. The celebrated Kannada folk song of antiquity Punyakoti (Govina Haadu) also refers to the region as \\"Mereyutiha Karnata Desha\\" (Flourishing Karnata country), finds a reference in Padma Purana. In Canto 5 - Chapter 6 of the Bhagavata Purana, Karnata is mentioned while narrating the life of Rishabhadeva. It is said in the Bhagavata that the Lord in Rishabhadeva's form ended his avatara in the Kutakachala hill in Karnata province. Kutakchala is a hill in present-day Karnataka near Kollur in the Western Ghats.SRIMAD BHAGAVATAM: CANTO 5- CHAPTER 6Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 5 Chapter 6 Historical references Scholars PƒÅ·πáini ( 520‚Äì460 BCE), Mrichchhakatika and Kathasaritsagara make references to Karnataka in their ancient works. Later, in the 5th century CE, the term Karnataka was used by the astrologer Varaha Mihira in his work Brihatkatha and the Birur plates of Kadamba Vishnuvarma call Shantivarma The master of the entire Karnataka region.Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, Concise history of Karnataka, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprinted 2002) In the 7th century CE, Rashtrakuta inscriptions refer to the armies of Chalukyas of Badami as Karnatakabala. The Tamil classic Silappatikaram of the same time period calls the people of present-day Karnataka region as Karunatakars..The Kalingathu parani, a war poem written by jayangkondar in Tamil Literature calls a people of a region called 'Karunatiyar'. In the 9th century CE, the Kannada classic Kavirajamarga hails the entire region between the rivers Kaveri and Godavari as Karnata.Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, History of South India, Arthikaje, History of Karnataka In the 13th century CE, Kannada poet Andayya's works use the same terminology. In the late 16th century, a Telugu work Vasucharitamu refers to Tirumala Deva Raya (1570 CE), the first of the Aravidu (Aravithi) line of rulers of the late Vijayanagar Empire as the reviver of the Karnata Empire.Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri, History of South India,Archaeological Survey of India, Telugu Inscriptions from Vijayanagar Empire , vol.16 All this clearly shows that the name Karnataka has been in usage consistently since ancient times.Dr. Suryanath U. Kamat, Concise history of Karnataka, 2001, MCC, Bengalooru (Reprinted 2002) Alternate theories Karnataka's name may have originated from the two words Kabbu Nadu, which means land of sugarcane. This etymology might be possible as Karnataka is a huge sugarcane-cultivating land. But, this theory might not be very factual as sugarcane production boomed in South Karnataka only after the building of KRS Dam by Sir M. Vishweshwarayya. Before that the very same region of Karnataka was known for ragi production.

Built when Oregon was a territory, the post was used mainly for dealing with wars with Native Americans. The post was first known as Camp Drum and then Fort Drum. Construction The first post was built on a site which overlooked an encampment used by Lewis and Clark in October 1805. This post was built in 1838 by the militia of the Oregon Provisional Government under the command of Henry A. G. Lee during the Cayuse War and was named Fort Lee.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. The post was built at the site of the former Wascopam Mission operated by the Methodist Mission. In the fall of 1849 United States Army troops arrived in the new Oregon Territory.Horner, John B. (1921). Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 122-123 This rifle regiment occupied the now-abandoned Fort Lee at Wascopum (now The Dalles on the Columbia River. A log fort was constructed in 1850 under the supervision of Major Tucker, and named Camp Drum. When the United States Congress changed the land requirements for Army forts to from , suddenly Camp Drum's tiny military contingent could control the land it required. Although no stockade was built around the post, Camp Drum became Fort Drum on May 21, 1853, and then Fort Dalles on June 21, 1853. New buildings were built from 1856 to 1858 under the direction of the commander Captain Thomas Jordan at a cost of nearly $500,000. Beginning in April 1858, the log fort was torn down and several new buildings, including a commander's house, barracks, and stables, were constructed under the command of Colonel George Wright, in command of the 9th Infantry. Operations During the Yakima Wars Fort Dalles served as operational headquarters for the Army. The garrison had eight companies of troops assigned during this time. After these wars the post was downgraded to a quartermaster's depot in 1861. A fire burned down the officer's quarters in 1866. Fort Dalles was then abandoned in 1867. Fort Dalles Museum The Fort Dalles Museum is located in the surgeon's quarters built in 1856 during the Yakima Wars, and the only remaining officer's house from that period. Exhibits include arrowheads, military and pioneer artifacts, period antiques and photographs, tools, weapons, saddles, and information about the fort.http://www.historicthedalles.org/fort_dalles/fort-dalles_gallery.htm Surgeon's Quarters exhibits The Anderson Homestead includes the 1895 Anderson House, which is a Swedish log house, a granary and a barn.

From 1910 he sat as an Independent Nationalist and at the 1918 general election he was elected for Sinn F√©in. Early life Ginnell was born in Delvin, County Westmeath in 1852, the son of Laurence Ginnell and Mary Monaghan and twin to Michael Ginnell. He was self-educated and was called to the Irish bar as well as the England bar. In his youth he was involved with the Land War and acted as private secretary to John Dillon. The last great social and agrarian campaign of the home rule movement ‚Äì the Ranch War (1906 and 1909) ‚Äì was largely led and organised by Ginnell from the central office of the United Irish League. Ginnell was elected an MP in 1906 and took his seat at Westminster, swearing allegiance to King Edward VII. On 14 October 1906, he launched the \\"war\\" at Downs, County Westmeath. > The purpose of the war was to bring relief to the large numbers of landless > and smallholders, particularly in the West, who were relatively untouched by > the Wyndham Land Purchase Act (1903) and by the larger policy of purchase. > The strategy that Ginnell pursued was the Down's Policy, or cattle driving, > a proceeding designed to harass the prosperous grazier interests, whose > 'ranches' occupied large, under populated and under worked tracts. The > 'Down's Policy' was also meant to draw public attention to the scandalous > inequalities that survived in the Irish countryside. The conservatives > within the Home rule leadership were understandably suspicious about the > revival of agrarian disturbances, but the mood of the party organisation was > hardening in the aftermath of a disappointing devolution bill in May 1907, > from the new Liberal government, so that it seemed logical to turn to the > traditional mechanism for reactivating the national question: agrarian > agitation.Jackson, 2003, p. 110-113 Ginnell's cattle-drives began to tail off after the summer of 1908, and the agitation was finally dissolved with the passage of a 1909 Act by the Liberal Chief Secretary Augustine Birrell that allowed the transfer to the Land Commission of farmland by compulsory purchase, which was hailed by the national movement as an historic victory. In reality, the Ranch War involved an implosion within sectors of the Irish Party, as its leadership had not facilitated the working of the Wyndham Land Purchase Act in the first place, because John Dillon and his like wanted conflict above victory.Jackson, 2003, p. 113 In 1909 Ginnell was expelled from the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) for the offence of asking to see the party accounts, after which he sat as an Independent Nationalist. During this time he was addressed frequently as \\"The MP for Ireland\\". At Westminster he was highly critical of the British Government's war policy, and its holding of executions of certain participants in the Easter Rising of 1916. On 9 May he accused the British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, of \\"Murder\\", and was forcibly ejected from the assembly. He visited many of the prisoners who were interned in various prisons in Wales and England, and smuggled out correspondence from them. Sinn F√©in In 1917 he campaigned to try to ensure the election of Count Plunkett in the Roscommon North by-election in which he defeated the IPP candidate on an abstentionist platform. Following the victory of √âamon de Valera in East Clare, while standing for Sinn F√©in, on 10 July 1917, Ginnell joined Sinn F√©in. At the Sinn F√©in Ard Fheis that year, at which the party was re-constituted as a Republican party with de Valera as President, Ginnell and W. T. Cosgrave were elected Honorary Treasurers. He was imprisoned in March 1918 for encouraging land agitation, and later deported to Reading Gaol. In the 1918 general election, he was elected as a Sinn F√©in MP for the Westmeath constituency, comfortably defeating his IPP challenger. After his release from prison, he attended the proceedings of the First D√°il. Along with fellow TD James O'Mara he was one of the only TDs ever before to sit in a parliament. He was one of the few people to have served in the House of Commons and in the Oireachtas. He was appointed Director of Propaganda in the Second Ministry of the Irish Republic. After spending a year as a Republican campaigner in Chicago, he was appointed the Representative of the Irish Republic in Argentina and South America by de Valera. He carried out his propaganda work here to distribute copies of the Irish Bulletin and to provide the Sinn F√©in version of the conflict during the War of Independence. On 16 August 1921 he returned home to attend the first meeting of the Second D√°il. He travelled back to Argentina some months later to serve as the Representative of the Republic there. Anti-Treaty opinion He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty that was ratified by the D√°il in January 1922, and was elected as an anti-Treaty Sinn F√©in TD at the 1922 general election on the eve of the Irish Civil War. On 9 September 1922, Ginnell was the only anti-Treaty TD to attend the inaugural meeting of the Provisional Parliament or Third D√°il. Before signing the roll Ginnell said: \\"I want some explanation before I sign. I have been elected in pursuance of a decree by D√°il √âireann, which decree embodies the decree of 20 May 1922. I have heard nothing read in reference to that decree, nothing but an Act of a foreign Parliament. I have been elected as a member of D√°il √âireann. I have not been elected to attend any such Parliament. Will anyone tell me with authority whether it is ‚Ä¶\\". He was at this point interrupted but resumed saying he would sign the roll and take his seat in the Assembly if the Assembly was D√°il √âireann. He was informed he was not allowed raise any such question until a Ceann Comhairle had been elected. He continued to ask questions regardless to which he got no answer including his question: \\"Will any member of the Six Counties be allowed to sit in this D√°il?\\".Election of Ceann Comhairle D√°il √âireann, volume 1, 9 September 1922 W. T. Cosgrave moved at this point that he be excluded from the House, Ginnell protested, and he was dragged out by force. De Valera later appointed him a member of his \\"Council of State\\", a twelve-member body set up to advise him on the deteriorating situation in the civil war. He returned to the United States soon afterwards to serve as the Republic's envoy in the country. He ordered Robert Briscoe and some of his friends to take possession of the Consular Offices in Nassau Street, New York City, then in the hands of the Free State Government, so as to obtain the list of the subscribers to the bond drive organized to aid the struggle in the War of Independence. At the time a court case was ongoing to decide on whomsoever had the right to the funds: the newly installed Provisional Government or de Valera, as one of the three trustees among the anti-Treatyites. Ginnell died in the United States on 17 April 1923, aged 71, still campaigning against the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

The School is located in the historical Faneromeni Square, situated in the centre of the capital and within the Venetian medieval walls of Nicosia. The School building features predominantly Greek neoclassical architectural traits, as well as, local Cypriot elements. The Marble Mausoleum on the eastern side of Faneromeni Church is situated on the front of the building and was built in memory of four clerics executed by the Ottoman governor in 1821, following the Cypriot revolt due to the newly declared Greek War of Independence.

Primarily it was used as ‚Äúparthenagogeio‚Äù which means a Girls Only School (G.O.S.). The school had 115 students but only one teacher. The only way she could teach all these children was by using the help of older children as teachers-assistants for the younger ones. As from 1903 Faneromeni School was also used for the training of the female teachers. The school took itsŒÑ present form in 1924 with financial assistance from the Faneromeni Church. Nowadays the school is a public school for boys and girls. Within the same building there is a nursery school, a primary school and a high school.

This form of relativism has its own particular problem, regardless of whether one is talking about truth being relative to the individual, the position or purpose of the individual, or the conceptual scheme within which the truth was revealed. This problem centers on what Maurice Mandelbaum in 1962 termed the \\"self-excepting fallacy.\\" Largely because of the self-excepting fallacy, few authors in the philosophy of science currently accept alethic cognitive relativism. Factual relativism (also called epistemic relativism, epistemological relativism, alethic relativism or cognitive relativism) is a way to reason where facts used to justify any claims are understood to be relative and subjective to the perspective of those proving or falsifying the proposition.Iris Einheuser, \\"Varieties of Relativism: Indexical, Propositional and Factual\\", from the Logos conference on RELATIVIZING UTTERANCE TRUTH, Barcelona, 2005. Viewpoints One school of thought compares scientific knowledge to the mythology of other cultures, arguing that it is merely our society's set of myths based on societal assumptions. For support, Paul Feyerabend's comments in Against Method that \\"The similarities between science and myth are indeed astonishing\\" and \\"First-world science is one science among many\\" (from the introduction to the Chinese edition) are sometimes cited, although it is not clear if Feyerabend meant them to be taken entirely seriously. The strong program in the sociology of science is (in the words of founder David Bloor) \\"impartial with respect to truth and falsity\\". Elsewhere, Bloor and Barry Barnes have said \\"For the relativist [such as us] there is no sense attached to the idea that some standards or beliefs are really rational as distinct from merely locally accepted as such.\\" In France, Bruno Latour has claimed that \\"Since the settlement of a controversy is the cause of Nature's representation, not the consequence, we can never use the outcome ‚Äì Nature ‚Äì to explain how and why a controversy has been settled.\\" Yves Winkin, a Belgian professor of communications, responded to a popular trial in which two witnesses gave contradicting testimony by telling the newspaper Le Soir that \\"There is no transcendent truth. [...] It is not surprising that these two people, representing two very different professional universes, should each set forth a different truth. Having said that, I think that, in this context of public responsibility, the commission can only proceed as it does.\\" The philosopher of science G√©rard Fourez wrote that \\"What one generally calls a fact is an interpretation of a situation that no one, at least for the moment, wants to call into question.\\"Fourez, G√©rard (1992). La Construction des sciences, 2eme edition revue. Brussels:De Boeck Universit√©. British archaeologist Roger Anyon told The New York Times that \\"science is just one of many ways of knowing the world... The Zuni's world view is just as valid as the archeological viewpoint of what prehistory is about.\\"Johnson, George. Indian Tribes' Creationists Thwart Archeologists, The New York Times, October 22, 1996 The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy summarizes that \\"Relativism has been, in its various guises, both one of the most popular and most reviled philosophical doctrines of our time. Defenders see it as a harbinger of tolerance and the only ethical and epistemic stance worthy of the open-minded and tolerant. Detractors dismiss it for its alleged incoherence and uncritical intellectual permissiveness.\\"  Related views and criticism  Cosmologist Stephen Hawking, in his book The Grand Design, has advocated for model- dependent realism. This view, which bears close resemblance to a relativist position, is seen by Hawking as a means of reconciling apparent inconsistencies between different iterations of M-Theory. Larry Laudan's book Science and Relativism outlines the various philosophical points of view on the subject in the form of a dialogue.Science and Relativism: Dialogues on the Philosophy of Science, Cognitive relativism has been criticized by both analytic philosophers and scientists.

The club began in 1978 as a loose association of young footballers playing recreationally as Kreuzberg Gen√ßler Birliƒüi (Kreuzberg Youth Union), named after the Berlin district of Kreuzberg. The club was formally registered as BFC ƒ∞zmirspor in 1983 and was named for the city of ƒ∞zmir, Turkey where many of the club members had roots.  History  Historical logo of T√ºrkiyemspor Berlin In its first season of play in 1983‚Äì84 in the C-Klasse amateur league the team captured the division title and they continued to enjoy other successes that would lead to their promotion to fourth-division play in the Landesliga Berlin in 1986, followed immediately by a climb into the third division Amateur-Oberliga Berlin the next season. Small businesses within the Turkish immigrant community in Berlin have played an important role in supporting the club throughout its history and in 1987 the team changed its name, becoming T√ºrkiyemspor Berlin in order to broaden its appeal. The club would field competitive sides in the third division (known variously as the Amateur Oberliga Berlin, the Amateur Oberliga Nordost-Mitte, and Regionalliga Nordost through this period) from the late 80s and on into the mid-90s. They also captured three consecutive Paul Rusch Cups (today's Berlin Cup) from 1989 to 1991 while making cup final appearances in 1988, 1993, and 1995. Those wins put them into DFB-Pokal competition: they were put out in the first round in each of their first two appearances and advanced only as far as the second round in the 1991‚Äì92 tournament. The club suffered a devastating blow in the 1990‚Äì91 season when they missed an opportunity for promotion to the 2. Fu√üball-Bundesliga when they were sanctioned for the use of an ineligible player. The club was leading its division in a close race with Tennis Borussia Berlin when an arbitrator ruled that the transfer to T√ºrkiyemspor of player Piotr Podkowik was illegal under league rules. Prior to this the BFV (Berliner Fu√üball-Verband or Berlin Football Federation) had approved the use of the player by the club. The president of the federation apologized, indicating that the league had made a mistake and that the club was blameless. By the time the unexpected decision had come down, Podkowik had already appeared in seven matches with the team and they were ordered to replay three of these games. The division title came down to the final game of the season against TeBe with T√ºrkiyemspor needing only a draw to advance: instead they went down to a stinging 0‚Äì5 defeat and so failed to advance. Since then the team has seen a dramatic decline in the number of spectators attending their matches. By the mid-90s the team found itself overmatched and slipped to fourth-tier play in the Amateur Oberliga Nordost-Nord after a last place finish in 1995. T√ºrkiyemspor fell to the Verbandsliga Berlin (V) in 1998 and spent two seasons there before returning to the Oberliga Nordost-Nord (IV) on the strength of a division championship in 2000. They continue to compete at this level, earning uneven results at or just below the mid-table. They finished NOFV-Oberliga Nord as 3rd in 2007‚Äì08 season and became one of the North Group of Regionalliga founders. They finished 15th Regionalliga in 2008‚Äì09 season and normally relegated to Oberliga Nord. However, they remained in Regionalliga after Kickers Emden's forced relegation from 3. Liga to the Oberliga due to financial problems. The club went into administration in December 2011 and withdrew their first team from the 2011‚Äì12 NOFV-Oberliga a month later; however, they still administer the women's and youth's teams. Despite the club being immersed in insolvency proceedings, the first team returned to league football and entered the Berlin-Liga (VI) in 2012, where they finished third from bottom. They were sent down to the Landesliga Berlin (VII) after a 26-year absence. They finished Staffel 1 of Landesliga Berlin as 9th in 2013‚Äì14 and as 12th in 2014‚Äì15 season.  Impact of the club on German football  T√ºrkiyemspor is recognised as being among the most successful clubs spawned within Germany's immigrant communities. They have contributed to creating a positive image for their community and helped set a confident example for Turks in the country with many other ethnically-Turkish clubs following in their footsteps. The name T√ºrkiyemspor is now also used by clubs in Moenchengladbach, Wuppertal, Breuberg, Amsterdam, Australia, and the United States. The club is actively involved several community-oriented programs built around anti-racism, intercultural understanding, a campaign against violence in families, and a campaign for respect for homosexuals known as \\"Respect-Gaymes\\". Working with the German Football Association T√ºrkiyemspor paved the way for teams rooted in the country's various immigrant communities (Migrantenvereine) to participate in first- and second-division football in Germany. Normally, league rules limit the number of foreign players permitted in a team's squad. T√ºrkiyemspor squads typically included many players without German citizenship from families of long-term migrant workers in the Turkish community. League rules were modified to exempt players without citizenship who could show that they had played several years of youth football in Germany.  Famous players  More than forty players have gone on to professional careers after getting their start with T√ºrkiyemspor. The most widely recognized of these is √úmit Karan who joined the Turkish club Gen√ßlerbirliƒüi before moving on to Galatasaray. Other former T√ºrkiyemspor players currently active professionally in Turkey include Cemil Mengi at √áaykur Rizespor, Serkan Birtan at Istanbul club Ey√ºpspor, and Deniz Aydoƒüdu at ƒ∞zmir club Kar≈üƒ±yaka. Michael Fu√ü set a Verbandsliga goal scoring record with 66 tallies in 1999‚Äì2000. * Kemal Halat  Honours  The club's honours: * Verbandsliga Berlin (V) ** Champions: 2000 * Berliner Landespokal ** Winners: 1988, 1990, 1991 ** Runners-up: 1989, 1993, 1995, 2001  External links  * * Abseits Guide to German Soccer Category:Football clubs in Germany Turkiyemspor Berlin Category:Association football clubs established in 1978 Category:1978 establishments in Germany Category:Turkish association football clubs outside Turkey Category:Migrant workers football clubs in Germany ","title":"T√ºrkiyemspor Berlin"},{"id":"9878611","text":"Rainey Endowed School, known colloquially as \\"The Rainey\\", is a voluntary grammar school in Magherafelt, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The school was founded in 1707 and has an enrolment of around 800 pupils. Each year group has a total number of 100 students. The school borders three counties and draws its students from County Londonderry, County Antrim and County Tyrone. It offers the Northern Ireland curricula up to the age of 16 and a range of AS and A2 courses at post 16. It is also a member of a local inter-school program which shares its A-level classes with other schools in the area. History =Establishment= Rainey Endowed School was founded by Hugh Rainey, an iron smelter and wealthy merchant in the Magherafelt district. He was an elder in the Presbyterian Congregation of Castledawson, which at that time included Magherafelt. As a result of a vow made to God for his protection and favour, he, by his will dated 11 April 1707, devoted one half of his estate to fund a charity school for 24 boys: \\"sons of parents who were of good report and reduced to poverty\\". After three years of instruction the boys were to be given a suit of clothes and ¬£2.50 for an apprentice fee. In his will, Hugh Rainey wrote \\"that what I have left may not only be for a generation or two, but that it may be for many not yet born\\", and so 'The Rainey' was founded. =Development= Hugh Rainey died in 1707 and the task of building the school fell to his only child, Elizabeth, and her husband. The school was built in 1713 on land leased from the Salters' Company, and is still on that site today. In 1863 negotiations with the Salters' Company resulted in the development of a new building. On 21 January 1863 the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, confirmed a new scheme of management. In 1864 the Salters' Company built a teachers' residence and a single schoolroom in Rainey Street Magherafelt. Girls were permitted into the school at the end of the 19th century. The school motto, taken from the Salters Company, is Sal Sapit Omnia, translated as Salt savours all. Background As of the academic year 2008-2009 pupils on roll were marked at 697 with four classes in each year. Teachers were numbered at male 21 and female 27. There were more than 20 subjects at Key Stage 4. It was over-subscribed, with 1.4 applications per place. There is a heavy emphasis on extra-curricular activity, including drama, public-speaking, choirs, orchestras, Scripture Union. Sport is a dominant feature, especially rugby, hockey, tennis, and athletics. 1st XV won subsidiary bowl of Schools' Cup; winners of North Easter seven-a-side rugby competition. The Rainey Under 14 hockey team won the Junior Cup beating Friends School, Lisburn in the final in 2008/09. The school has a strong musical traditions, with choirs, orchestras; traditional Irish musical groups, encouragement of solo performance, and drama productions. More than 100 pupils take part in the Duke of Edinburgh Award scheme; 25 raised ¬£35,000 for Gold Expedition in Kenya, with half of the money given to a charitable organisation that funds primary education in Nairobi. There has been a recent emphasis by the sixth form on charity fundraising; large amounts have been raised for tsunami appeal, Leukaemia Research, and Cystic Fibrosis Trust. Plans were announced in April 2004 for a new ¬£14.3 million school to be built. The Sunday Times Parent Power selected the school to be Secondary School of the year 2016 for Northern Ireland.

It is known for its solid black body, which makes it an appealing tarantula for the pet trade. Description Commonly known as the Brazilian black, mature specimens are almost entirely black. Although like most new world tarantulas it possesses urticating hairs, if provoked, they would much rather flee than attack. Their venom is not as irritating as many other species of tarantulas. The Brazilian black is a slow grower, taking up to eight years to reach maturity, reaching up to . As with all tarantulas, females of this species will almost always outlive males by many years. As a juvenile in captivity, this species tends to burrow when given the opportunity. They thrive on mealworms, crickets, roaches, and other small insects. Pet trade The species is desirable in the pet trade because of the females' long lifespan and reputation for being docile and gentle in temperament, as well as for its appealing dark coloration. These traits make them rather expensive when buying from a breeder. It is said to have a reduced tendency to kick urticating hairs off when handled, which adds to its desirability as a pet. Many times, they do not spread urticating hairs around their homes, as observed in other tarantula species. Because of a ban on the export of wild caught specimens and its slow growth, mature females (preferred because of their long life) are generally expensive.

Coastal Karnataka is covered under the Konkan railway network, a project that is regarded as one of the feats of Indian engineering and included the construction of a bridge of length across the river Sharavathi at Honnavar and a tunnel of length at Karwar. Bengaluru, the capital city, is extensively connected with inter-state destinations while other important cities and towns in the state are not so well-connected.The state of Railways in Karnataka is discussed by The train connectivity within Karnataka has improved since K.H.Muniyappa, Member of Parliament from Kolar constituency has been the Union Minister of State for Railways. * Mangaluru, one of the major cities in Karnataka now has a train service to other major cities like Bengaluru, Mysuru started on 8 December 2007, but not directly to Hubballi. There is a proposed railway line between Hubballi and Ankola to fulfill this demand.http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/article1401870.ece * Shivamogga-Talaguppa, Mysore-Chamarajanagar meter-gauge tracks has been converted to broad-gauge. There is a direct train service from Mysuru to Talaguppa which is very close to the world-famous Jog Falls.An announcement regarding the extension of Bangalore-Shivamogga Express (night train) to Talaguppa has been made in the Railway Budget 2012‚Äì13. There are 4 direct passenger trains running from Mysuru to Chamarajanagar and a Chamarajanagar- Tirupati fast passenger which connects to the state capital Bengaluru via Mysuru. * District capital like Madikeri is not connected by a rail network. A rail link to Madikeri would be difficult since it is a hill station and any construction activity would harm the pristine environment. * The district of Kodagu has no railway track within it. However a survey is under progress to link Mysuru with Kushalnagar in Kodagu district. * Doubling of the track between Bengaluru and Mysuru (a line that receives very good patronage) is already completed. * Though the state has Konkan Railway within it; it has remained isolated with no trains running from other parts of the state to places that exist on the Konkan Railway. The superfast Shatabdi Express trains run from Bengaluru to Chennai and Mysuru. A Jan Shatabdi express runs from Bengaluru to Hubballi and this is the first train in India that has been fitted with a GPS (Global Position System) based Location Announcement System. Using this system, the passengers are announced apriori the arrival of a station.The state of Railways in Karnataka is discussed by Konkan Railway is an engineering marvel; the construction of which included the bridge across the river Sharavathi at Honnavar of length 2,023 m and a tunnel at Karwar of length 2,960 m.

Water transport  Karnataka has 1 major port; the New Mangaluru Port and 10 minor ports; Karwar, Belekeri, Tadri, Honnavara, Bhatkal, Kundapur, Hangarkatta, Malpe, Padubidri and Old Mangaluru.Ports in Karnataka are mentioned by The construction of the New Mangaluru Port was started in 1962 and completed in 1974. It was incorporated as the 9th major port in India on 4 May 1974. This port handled 32.04 million tonnes of traffic in the fiscal year 2006‚Äì07 with 17.92 million tonnes of imports and 14.12 million tonnes of exports.Details related to New Mangaluru Port is provided by This was actually a slowdown in traffic at this port compared to the previous fiscal year mainly due to the reduction in iron ore exports from the Kudremukha Iron Ore Company limited. The port also handled 1015 vessels including 18 cruise vessels during the year 2006‚Äì07. The sector of Inland water transport within the rivers of Karnataka is not well-developed.  Road transport  Among the network of roads in Karnataka, 3973 km. of roads are National Highways.National Highways in Karnataka are mentioned by Karnataka also has state highways of length 9829 km. The public bus transport in Karnataka is managed by the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC). It was set up in 1961 with the objective of providing adequate, efficient, economic and properly coordinated road transport services.A brief discussion on KSRTC is provided by It operates 5100 schedules using 5400 vehicles covering 1.95 million kilometres and an average of 2.2 million passengers daily. About 25000 people are employed in KSRTC. For better management of public transport, KSRTC was bifurcated into three Corporations viz., Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation, Bengaluru on 15 August 1997, North-west Karnataka Road Transport Corporation, Hubballi on 1 November 1997 and North-East Karnataka Road Transport Corporation, Gulbarga on 1 October 2000. The reservation system is networked and computerised and tickets can be availed at designated kiosks in towns and cities. An online reservation system called AWATAR has also been devised by KSRTC using which travellers can reserve tickets online. KSRTC plies various categories of buses viz. Ambaari Dream Class AC Sleeper (Volvo), Airavat Club-Class (high-end luxury Volvo, Scania, Mercedes-Benz multi-axle AC buses), Airavat (high-end luxury Volvo and Mercedes Benz AC buses), Ambaari(Corona AC and non AC Sleeper buses), Rajahamsa Executive (Deluxe buses built on Leyland, Eicher and Tata chassis), Karnataka Vaibhav (Semi-Deluxe buses built on Leyland, Eicher and Tata chassis), Karnataka Saarige (Bus service linking rural areas to major settlements as well as the cheapest alternative for inter-city or town routes. The buses are built on Tata and Leyland chassis). Grameena Sarige is another initiative by KSRTC to provide bus service to the rural populace of the state. Buses run by private persons are allowed to operate in few districts of Karnataka.Inter district transportation are run by private operators, connecting capital Bengaluru and main cities like Mangaluru and Dharwad to district headquarters. Intra district transportation by private operators is currently allowed in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts. Omni bus and Maxi cabs are also other modes of road transportation in the state, especially where KSRTC does not buses or run very few.

Hinduism The three most important schools of Vedanta Hinduism, Advaita Vedanta, Vishishtadvaita and Dvaita, blossomed in Karnataka. The Dvaita Madhvacharya was born in Karnataka. The Advaita Adi Shankara chose Shringeri in Karnataka to establish the first of his four mathas. The Vishishtadvaita Ramanuja, considered a saint in Sri Sampradaya, who fled persecution by the Shaiva Chola dynasty of Tamil Nadu, spent from 1098-1122 in Karnataka. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melukote where the Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple and a well-organised matha were built. He was patronized by Hoysala Vishnuvardhana.(Kamath 2001), p150-152 Udupi, Shringeri, Gokarna and Melukote are well known places of Sanskrit and Vedic learning. Basavanna flourished Lingayatism in Karnataka. In the 12th century, social reforms emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of the movement such as Basava, Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu established the Anubhava Mantapa where Lingayatism was expounded. Nearly 17% population of Karnataka belongs to Lingayat sect. Jainism Gommateshvara Bahubali, 981 CE. Jainism had a stronghold in Karnataka in the early medieval period at Shravanabelagola as its most important centre.At least 30% of the population may have been Jains during the time of the Rashtrakuta and Western Gangas (Altekar in Kamath 2001, p92) The first Tirthankara, Rishabha, is said to have spent his final days in Karnataka. Both Jain philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. Jain influence on literature and philosophy is particularly evident.The earliest cultivators of Kannada literature (Narasimhacrhaya 1988, p17 Shravanabelgola, Moodabidri, and Karkala are famous for Jain history and monuments. Buddhism Buddhism was once popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as Gulbarga and Banavasi. A chance discovery of edicts and several Mauryan relics at Sannati in the Gulbarga district in 1986 has proven that the Krishna river basin was once home to both Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism. In recent times, Buddhism thrives here and calls Dzogchen monastery and the Dhondeling Tibetan refugee camps as home. Culture Karnataka played a very important role in shaping present day Indian religion and philosophy. Udupi, Sringeri, Gokarna and Melukote are well known places of Sanskrit learning and Vedic learning. Shravanabelagola, Mudabidri, Karkala are famous for Jain history and monuments. The great saint Madhvacharya (1238-1317 AD), proponent of dvaita philosophy and Raghavendra Swami were born here. Adi Sankara, proponent of advaita found enlightenment in Sringeri which became the first of four mathas he established in India. Fearing persecution from the Tamil CholasRamanujacharya fled Tamil Nadu and came to Karnataka during the rule of the Hoysala dynasty and preached his philosophy from Melukote.Fearing persecution by the Cholas who were staunch Shaiva, Ramanujacharya came to Karnataka in 1098 and lived there till 1122 C.E. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melukote where the Cheluvanarayana temple and a well organised Matha were built. Hoysala Vishnuvardhana became his devotee and converted from Jainism to Hinduism. This helped popularise his Vishva adviata philosophy in the region, A Concise History of Karnataka, Dr. S.U. Kamath, A History of South India, From Prehistoric times to fall of Vijayanagar, by Prof. K.A. Nilakanta Sastri In the 12th century AD, Virashaivism spread from northern Karnataka across the Deccan. Many of its founders, such as Basavanna, Akka Mahadevi came from the region. It was here the Jain religion got a warm welcome and enjoyed a glorious growth during the medieval period. It is also here where the current day Dzogchen Monastery and the Dhondeling Tibetan Refugee camps are set up and the Tibetans are very well absorbed in the Kannadiga culture. =Temples= Bhutanatha temple complex, at Badami The Empires and Kingdoms that came to rule from Karnataka were prolific builders. The Badami Chalukyas spawned the Vesara style of architecture and experimented with several myriad styles with frequent intermixing of Nagara and Dravida concepts. This period is the beginning of Hindu rock cut architecture, both in stand alone and cave temple idioms, numerous examples of which exist in Pattadakal, Aihole and Badami - (Badami Cave Temples). Their successors, the Rashtrakuta created master piece temples further favoring Dravidian concepts. Most of their temples in Karnataka are scattered over northern Karnataka districts. The Ganga Dynasty of Talakad built many Jaina monuments including the monolithic statue of Gomateshwara at Shravanabelagola. The Western Chalukyas used the In-between style, implying a bridge between Chalukya - Rashtrakuta and Hoysala styles, with the best temples of their style located in the central districts of Gadag district(Lakkundi, Dambal, Sudi, Lakshmeshwar, Gadag), Koppal district(Mahadeva Temple (Itagi), Kuknur), Haveri district (Galaganatha, Chaudayyadanapura, Haveri, Harlahalli, Hangal) and Dharwad District (Annigeri, Kundgol, Tamboor, Chandramouleshwara Temple Unakal Hubli). It was during the reign of the Hoysalas that the temple architecture reached its epoch and gained recognition as an independent style called (Henry Ferguson, Percy Brown) owing to its many unique features. Later the Vijayanagar Empire would incorporate all these various styles and create a unique blend called Vijayanagar style, the best examples of which are in the vast open air theater of monuments at Hampi. Islam and Christianity Islam, which had an early presence in the west coast of India as early as the 10th century gained a foothold in Karnataka with the arrival of the Bahmani Sultanate and Adil Shahi dynasty, which ruled parts of Karnataka.Sastri (1955), p396 Christianity reached Karnataka in the 16th century with the arrival of the Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545.Sastri (1955), p398 Today, Islam and Christianity have a sizable following in Karnataka and have contributed to the cultural cosmopolitanism of the state. =Islam= Ibrahim Roza monuments, 17th century. Islam arrived in Karnataka and Kerala in the 7th century with Arab merchants trading in spices. Muslims introduced coffee, and the paper industry to the local economy.Encyclopaedia of India: Karnataka, Pran Nath Chopra (1992)Muslim Wedding South India Following the 12th century, various invading Islamic armies established sultanates in this area such as the Bahamani sultanate of Bidar (1347‚Äì1510) and the Adilshahi dynasty of the Bijapur Sultanate (1490‚Äì1686). This land came under Mughal rule in the 17th century under Aurangzeb's rule. With the disintegration of Mughal rule, Hyder Ali and his son Tippu Sultan established their rule over the Mysore area. They violently resisted British rule in the area, but without adequate cooperation from other kingdoms, were defeated. Though killed by the British in 1799, Tippu Sultan was one of the only Indian leaders to defeat the British in battle,Tipu Sultan Profile which made him as an iconic leader among the people in the modern era. In addition, the Nizams of Hyderabad ruled over large parts of Northeastern Karnataka. This land only became part of Karnataka after the passing of the 1956 States Reorganisation Act. Muslims form approximately 12.91% of the population of Karnataka.Indian Census 2001 - Religion While Muslims can be found in all districts of Karanataka, Muslims have a stronger presence in:Map of Muslims in India 1\\\\. Northern Karnataka (especially in the area formerly ruled by the Princely State of Hyderabad) such as Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, Raichur and Dharwad. 2\\\\. The districts bordering Kerala. 3\\\\. The cities of Bangalore, Mysore and Mangalore. On the other hand, the proportion of Muslims is lower in central Karnataka. The main spoken language of Muslims in Karnataka is a dialect called dakhini which consists of Urdu and few others. Most Muslims in Karnataka also speak Kannada, Telugu and Sindhi. There are a large number of Muslim run educational institutions in Karnataka. Muslims also have modestly higher levels of progress in terms of education and wealth in Karnataka (as in the rest of South India) than in states of North India, as they are comparatively given more opportunities than their North Indian counterparts.Sachar Committee Report =Christianity= Christianity arrived in Karnataka between 1500-1600 CE with the Portuguese. the majority of Christians found in west coast of Karnataka that is from Karwar to Mangalore. Mangalore has the largest population of Roman Catholics as compared to other parts of Karnataka. They are mostly descended from Goan Catholics and Orthodox Christian's who immigrated from Goa in the 17th and 18th centuries. There are also some Protestants found in Karnataka. Many of them are of local origin. Protestants are the result of British missionaries' work during the British empire in India. However the British conversion was voluntary and not compulsory as Portuguese was in most cases. Due to this the Protestants are less in number as compared to the Catholics. Bangalore has a large number of Catholics as well as Protestant people. St. Mary's Basilica is the only basilica in Karnataka and the oldest church in Bangalore.

The La Entrada Archaeological Project (PALE - from Proyecto Arqueol√≥gico La Entrada in Spanish) started excavations at El Puente in 1991 with the intention of creating the second archaeological park in the country, after Cop√°n.Nakamura & Cruz Torres 1994, p.518 The Parque Arqueol√≥gico El Puente opened on 20 January 1994 and includes a visitor centre, site museum and administrative offices. History El Puente appears to have been first settled around the middle of the 6th century AD, in the Early Classic period, fairly late in the Mesoamerican timescale and occupation at the site did not last very long.Nakamura & Cruz Torres 1994, p.521 Architectural and ceramic similarities with Cop√°n suggest that El Puente was founded by that city to control the crossroads of two trade routes that met in the valley. The site was a regional centre during the Late Classic period when it remained closely allied with the great city of Cop√°n.Nakamura & Cruz Torres 1994, p. 523 After the collapse of Cop√°n in the Terminal Classic (between AD 850-950), the La Entrada region suffered politically with local elites losing prestige and territory. However, unlike at Cop√°n, there does not seem to have been overuse of local resources and El Puente appears to have received immigrants from Cop√°n during the Late Classic. Site description Although the architecture is predominantly Maya there are slight non-Maya influences from the neighbouring non-Maya area, such as long structures connected end-to-end. The architecture at El Puente also tends to lack the symmetry found in traditional Maya sites with a long occupational history, perhaps due to a lesser level of technical ability. For example, stairways on the main buildings are of different sizes on each of the four sides of the structures. Quality of workmanship in the working of stone for construction can differ markedly from one building to the next, or even within the same structure. The principal materials for construction were tufa, schist and a hard limestone, with tufa being the commonest stone used at the site. The tufa is very fragile and the cut tufa stones have frequently crumbled to dust.Nakamura & Cruz Torres 1994, p.522 The infill used within the structures is quite inconsistent and consists of stone, earth and clay. The mortar used in construction was of low quality, with little lime, using only a hard clay that was particularly vulnerable to water damage, causing the stucco facing to come away from the structures and resulting in their complete collapse. The plazas had a well-designed drainage system to channel runoff rainwater. These channels were carved from stone and at the base of Structure 5 one of the channels is still functional. Another has been excavated on the east side of Structure 3. Several burials have been excavated, some are accompanied by offerings of jade and ceramic vessels decorated with bands of hieroglyphs. One of these vessels contained an additional offering of 13 obsidian prismatic blades. Rough stones were placed in a circle around one burial, with a seashell placed beside the skull. Green obsidian from the Pachuca source in central Mexico has been excavated at the site. =Structures= El Puente has 210 structures and the site core contains 5 plazas. Nine structures at the site have been investigated and restored. Parts of the site have been severely damaged by looters and by agricultural activities. Structure 1 is the tallest building at El Puente, measuring tall. It appears to have been built in the 7th century AD, its earliest version bears a stylistic similarity to buildings from that period in Cop√°n. It was a radial pyramid with six tiers and stairways on all four sides, with the east and west stairways being the best preserved. It was topped by a superstructure with three rooms and fallen remains indicated that it had a vaulted roof with channels to drain off rainwater. The wall was decorated with sculptures of three human figures. Archaeologists have tunnelled within the structure and have also excavated around it, revealing a large amount of ceramic fragments, burnt clay, and burnt maize and beans.Nakamura & Cruz Torres 1994, pp.522, 524 The structure has been badly damaged by looters. Structure 3 has excellent quality stonework in the wall on the north side of its first-level platform but the rest of the building features markedly poorer quality workmanship. Structure 4 is on the northwest side of Plaza 1, at the extreme northwest of the site core. Structure 5 is also on the northwest side of Plaza 1, at the extreme northwest of the site core. It has three Cop√°n-style rooms and traces of domestic activity were found during excavation. At only thick, the walls were not thick enough to have supported a vaulted roof. Structure 31 is a pyramid on the eastern side of the site core. Its eastern portion has been badly damaged by looters. The structure supported two rooms. The main room has the remains of a stone bench and an entrance that opens onto the main stairway that climbs the west side of the structure from Plaza C. The building had several construction phases, all dating to the Late Classic. Excavators found an increase in fragments of Cop√°n-style polychrome ceramics in the final construction phase. An altar and a stela were associated with the temple, the stela was not inscribed with any hieroglyphic text.

This is the only film directed by Frank Sinatra, and the first Japanese-American co- production.Liner notes, pg. 2, None but the Brave soundtrack album, FSM Vol. 12, No. 2 Plot Narrated in English by a Japanese officer named Kuroki (in the form of a journal he is writing for his wife), the film is set in the Asiatic-Pacific theater during an unspecified period of World War II. A platoon of 16 Japanese soldiers is stranded on an island in the Pacific with no means of communicating with the outside world. Lieutenant Kuroki keeps his men firmly in hand and is supervising the building of a boat for their escape. An American C-47/R4D transport plane is shot down by a Japanese Zero, crash landing on the same island. The Zero and an American F4U Corsair destroy each other, with no outside commands learning of the island. Marine Aircraft Wing Captain Dennis Bourke assumes command of the platoon of Marines he was transporting, over their 2nd Lieutenant Blair and Sergeant Bleeker. Confidante to Bourke is Navy chief pharmacist's mate Francis. As the 19 Americans learn of the Japanese platoon‚Äôs existence on the island, tension mounts resulting in a battle for the Japanese boat. The vessel is destroyed and a Japanese soldier is seriously injured. Calling a truce, Koruki trades the Americans access to water in exchange for a visit from their doctor to treat the wounded soldier, whose leg has to be amputated. The truce results in both platoons, reduced in numbers through their earlier conflicts and later natural disasters, choosing to live side by side - although a line is drawn forbidding one from encroaching on the other's side of the island. There is some clandestine cooperation and trading and earnest respect and friendship. When the Americans establish radio contact and their pickup by a US naval vessel is arranged, they demand that the Japanese surrender, but Kuroki reestablishes that they are at war. As the Americans proceed to the beach, Bourke orders his men to be ready to shoot to kill. When they are ambushed by the remaining 8 men of the Japanese platoon, the remaining 11 Americans are given no option but to retaliate, resulting in a bloody and pointless firefight during which all the Japanese and most of the Americans are shot dead. Only Francis, Bourke, Bleeker, Blair and Corporal Ruffino survive the skirmish. Bourke orders Francis to examine the mortally wounded Kuroki to see if he can be saved. They move onto the beach and wait to be rescued by the American naval vessel, stationed just offshore. Francis reports Kuroki's death and hands Bourke the Japanese officer's journal, written in Japanese with what appears to be an address. Bourke speculates that one day he will be able to deliver it to Kuroki's widow. Kuroki's final narration calls what he is to do \\"just another day.\\" The film ends with a long shot of the island, superimposed with the words \\"Nobody ever wins.\\" Cast Japanese: *Tatsuya Mihashi as Lt.

Roth Production notes The title is from the John Dryden poem, Alexander's Feast, stanza 1: \\"None but the brave/deserves the fair.\\" This was the sixth of nine films produced by Frank Sinatra, and the only film he directed. The executive producers carried extra fame in their own right - William H. Daniels was former president of the American Society of Cinematographers, while Howard W. Koch was former president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. During filming, on May 10, 1964 in Hawaii, Sinatra was caught in a riptide along with Ruth Koch, wife of Howard Koch. Actor Brad Dexter (Sgt. Bleeker) and two surfers were able to rescue Sinatra and Koch, saving their lives. Release None But the Brave was released in Japan on 15 January 1965 where it was distributed by Toho. It was released in the United States on February 1965. Critical response Upon release, The New York Times‚Äô Bosley Crowther gave the production a largely negative review, writing, \\"A minimum show of creative invention and a maximum use of cinema clich√©s are evident in the staging of this war film,\\" and \\"Mr. Sinatra, as producer and director, as well as actor of the secondary role of the booze-guzzling medical corpsman, displays distinction only in the latter job. Being his own director, he has no trouble stealing scenes, especially the one in which he burbles boozy wisecracks while preparing to saw off the shivering Japanese's leg. Mr. Sinatra is crashingly casual when it comes to keeping the Japanese in their place.\\" Crowther also noted \\"Clint Walker ‚Ä¶ Tommy Sands ‚Ä¶ Brad Dexter ‚Ä¶ and Tony Bill ‚Ä¶ make over- acting‚Äîphony acting‚Äîthe trademark of the film. What with incredible color and the incredible screenplay of Katsuya Susaki and John Twist, this adds up to quite a fake concoction.\\"The New York Times, \\"He Stars in War Film, None But the Brave\\" By Bosley Crowther. February 25, 1965. Current critic Robert Horton (of Washington‚Äôs The Herald) calls None but the Brave \\"a 1965 anti-war picture that turns out to be much more interesting and compelling than its reputation would suggest,\\" that \\"predates the rash of anti-war counterculture movies by a few years,\\" also noting that it \\"bears the influence of Bridge on the River Kwai with a little Mister Roberts thrown in, but it has a bitterness about war that goes all the way through to the forceful final title, a reflection of Sinatra's liberal views at the time.‚Äù Horton points out that Clint Eastwood received a lot of credit for making two films that showed World War II from the American and the Japanese sides (Flags of Our Fathers and Letters from Iwo Jima), but that \\"in a way, Sinatra had already done it, and in one movie.\\"Robert Horton, Amazon Editorial Review for None But the Brave Comic book adaption * Dell Movie Classic: None but the Brave (April‚ÄìJune 1965)  References  =Footnotes= =Sources= * Bibliography * Ragone, August (2007, 2014).

It is the homologue of the human \\"G/T binding protein,\\" (GTBP) also called p160 or hMSH6 (human MSH6). The MSH6 protein is a member of the Mutator S (MutS) family of proteins that are involved in DNA damage repair. Defects in hMSH6 are associated with atypical hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer not fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria for HNPCC. hMSH6 mutations have also been linked to endometrial cancer and the development of endometrial carcinomas.  Discovery  MSH6 was first identified in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae because of its homology to MSH2. The identification of the human GTBP gene and subsequent amino acid sequence availability showed that yeast MSH6 and human GTBP were more related to each other than any other MutS homolog, with a 26.6% amino acid identity. Thus, GTBP took on the name human MSH6, or hMSH6.  Structure  In the human genome, hMSH6 is located on chromosome 2. It contains the Walker-A/B adenine nucleotide binding motif, which is the most highly conserved sequence found in all MutS homologs. As with other MutS homologs, hMSH6 has an intrinsic ATPase activity. It functions exclusively when bound to hMSH2 as a heterodimer, although hMSH2 itself can function as a homomultimer or as a heterodimer with hMSH3.  Function  =Importance of mismatch repair= Mismatches commonly occur as a result of DNA replication errors, genetic recombination, or other chemical and physical factors.Friedberg EC, Walker GC, Siede W. (1995). DNA repair and mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington DC. Recognizing those mismatches and repairing them is extremely important for cells, because failure to do so results in microsatellite instability, an elevated spontaneous mutation rate (mutator phenotype), and susceptibility to HNPCC. hMSH6 combines with hMSH2 to form the active protein complex, hMutS alpha, also called hMSH2-hMSH6. = Mismatch recognition = Mismatch recognition by this complex is regulated by the ADP to ATP transformation, which provides evidence that hMutS alpha complex functions as a molecular switch. In normal DNA, adenine (A) bonds with thymine (T) and cytosine (C) bonds with guanine (G). Sometimes there will be a mismatch where T will bind with G, which is called a G/T mismatch. When a G/T mismatch is recognized, hMutS alpha complex binds and exchanges ADP for ATP. The ADP-->ATP exchange causes a conformational change to convert hMutS alpha into a sliding clamp that can diffuse along the DNA backbone. The ATP induces a release of the complex from the DNA and allows the hMutS alpha to dissociate along the DNA like a sliding clamp. This transformation helps trigger downstream events to repair the damaged DNA.  Cancer  Although mutations in hMSH2 cause a strong general mutator phenotype, mutations in hMSH6 cause only a modest mutator phenotype. At the gene level, the mutations were found to cause primarily single-base substitution mutations, which suggests that the role of hMSH6 is primarily for correcting single-base substitution mutations and to a lesser extent single base insertion/deletion mutations. Mutations in the hMSH6 gene cause the protein to be nonfunctional or only partially active, thus reducing its ability to repair mistakes in DNA. The loss of MSH6 function results in instability at mononucleotide repeats. HNPCC is most commonly caused by mutations in hMSH2 and hMLH1, but mutations in hMSH6 are linked to an atypical form of HNPCC. The penetrance of colorectal cancer seems to be lower in these mutations, meaning that a low proportion of hMSH6 mutation carriers present with the disease. Endometrial cancer, on the other hand, seems to be a more important clinical manifestation for female mutation carriers. The onset of endometrial cancer and also colon cancer in families with hMSH6 mutations is about 50 years. This is delayed compared to the age 44 onset of hMSH2-related tumors. Epigenetic control of MSH6 in cancer Two microRNAs, miR21 and miR-155, target the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes hMSH6 and hMSH2, to cause reduced expression of their proteins. If one or the other of these two microRNAs is over-expressed, hMSH2 and hMSH6 proteins are under- expressed, resulting in reduced DNA mismatch repair and increased microsatellite instability. One of these microRNAs, miR21, is regulated by the epigenetic methylation state of the CpG islands in one or the other of its two promoter regions. Hypomethylation of its promoter region is associated with increased expression of an miRNA. High expression of a microRNA causes repression of its target genes (see microRNA silencing of genes). In 66% to 90% of colon cancers, miR-21 was over-expressed, and generally the measured level of hMSH2 was decreased (and hMSH6 is unstable without hMSH2). The other microRNA, miR-155, is regulated both by epigenetic methylation of the CpG islands in its promoter region and by epigenetic acetylation of histones H2A and H3 at the miR-155 promoter (where acetylation increases transcription). Measured by two different methods, miR-155 was over-expressed in sporadic colorectal cancers by either 22% or 50%. When miR-155 was elevated, hMSH2 was under-expressed in 44% to 67% of the same tissues (and hMSH6 is likely under- expressed as well, and also unstable in the absence of hMSH2).  Interactions  MSH6 has been shown to interact with MSH2, PCNA and BRCA1.

M. Shafiullah, is a retired Bangladeshi general, former Chief of Army Staff of the Bangladesh Army, and former Member of Parliament. As the Second in Command of Second East Bengal Regiment, along with his battalion, he was the first Bengali officer to stage a rebellion on 19 March 1971 while 57 Bde Commander- Brig. Jahanzeb Arbab came to visit Joydevpur. He killed four non-Bengali officers of his own unit along with several non-Bengali soldiers hailing from then West Pakistan. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, he was the Second in Command of Second East Bengal Regiment that revolted with six officers on the night of 4 April 1971. He became the Sector Commander of Sector 3, headquartered in Teliapara, Sylhet. He directly participated in active combat and escaped certain death at least in two such combats. Towards the end of September he was appointed one of three brigade commanders, leading what was called the \\"S-force\\" (after his surname) during the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. Shafiullah became Chief of Army Staff in April 1972. After the 15 August 1975 Bangladesh coup d'√©tat, President Khondaker Mostaq Ahmad replaced him with Major General Ziaur Rahman. Military Career He was commissioned from 12 PMA Long Course in 1955. Bangladesh Liberation War Shafiullah was the Sector Commander of Bangladesh Forces Sector 3. His sector was headquartered in Teliapara, Sylhet from where he commanded his troops and took part in active combats during the entire duration of the war. His sector's areas were Dhaka, Mymensingh, Sylhet and parts of Comilla (present Brahmanbaria district). Later three brigades were formed, each identified by the initial of the commander's surname. His formation was fully structured and formalised by the end of September. As of September 1971, Commander of Sector 3 was assigned to Major A. N. M. Nuruzzaman. Major Shafiullah was among those attending the Pakistan surrender on 16 December 1971 at Race Course in Dhaka. Chief of Army Staff After the end of the war in December 1971, the Bangladesh government awarded him the Bir Uttam (medal) for his bravery and dedication, the second-highest military award in the country. He was appointed as the Chief of Army Staff of Bangladesh Army on 5 April 1972 by the Awami League government under Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. On 7 April 1972, General M. A. G. Osmani resigned from his post, and the Army command was given to Shafiullah, the Bangladesh Air Force to A. K. Khandker and the Bangladesh Navy to Nurul Haq. He was the chief of staff of the Bangladesh Army during the assassination of then president Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. During the assassination, he was kept in the dark about the plot, intelligence failed and he could not save the President. Dismissed from the position on 25 August 1975 by the following Mushtaq government, he retired from the army. He was succeeded by Ziaur Rahman as army Chief. Suspecting his intentions based on his loyalty towards Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, General Shafiullah was sent overseas with an ambassadorial post, along with fellow Bangladesh Air Force Chief of Air Staff Air Vice Marshal A. K. Khandker. He was elected as an Awami League Member of Parliament in 1996. After retirement from army and into diplomatic circles K. M. Shafiullah was appointed the first Bangladeshi High Commissioner to Malaysia. Malaysiahat had recognised the Independence of Bangladesh very soon after the liberation war. He thereafter went onto serve as the High Commissioner to Canada and South America. He was transferred to Sweden as the Ambassador to the Scandinavian region and finally to London as the High Commissioner. K. M. Shafiullah demonstrated a natural charisma and diplomacy in dealing with international and diplomatic affairs and in transitioning good relations between Bangladesh and the countries in which he served. During the time of serving his posting in London he was the most senior ambassador in the Commonwealth, having spent 20 years promoting the values and mission of the newly formed Bangladesh nation. Life in politics In 1990 he returned to Bangladesh in retirement from diplomatic service and was reintroduced into the social fabric of national service, by being elected as an MP through the Awami League political party, the party of Sheikh Mujib. He served as an MP for the constituency of Rupganj, the area from which he originated. During his tenure as MP he was responsible for creating many roads and facilitating the formation of development and job creation in the constituency. Following two terms as an MP he retired from government. Returning to a life as a civilian and freedom fighter Being the most senior army officer in Bangladesh, he was invited to chair the sector commanders forum in 2014. Through this association he has led marches and protests well into his late 70s to bring to account war criminals responsible for the atrocities of 1971. He has also led movements against corruption and poverty as an idealist of the revolution.

The park is located close to Woodside tram stop, where Tramlink services the park. It is on the junction of Lower Addiscombe Road and Spring Lane. The park covers an area of and includes a village green, p√©tanque terrain, bowling green, tennis and basketball courts and a caf√© (derelict for several years). History The site was once the location of Woodside Convent, and the property has changed hands many times since then. A mansion was built on the site in 1788. Croydon Corporation bought the house and grounds by Compulsory Purchase Order in 1924. Most of the buildings were torn down, with a putting green (no longer there) being laid on the site. The only remaining part of the house was the c. 1878 extension which became Ashburton Library. The library was relocated in 2006‚Äì2007 to the nearby Ashburton School and the building fell into disrepair. Despite the neglect of the caf√© and former library building the local council have spent some money on renovating the public toilets, improving the children's playing park and adding some features for joggers and fun runners on the perimeter paths.http://thefoap.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2015/10/fitness-trail-map.jpg (Retrieved 15 September 2020) The Friends of Ashburton Park group, launched in September 2013, have come together to put the former library back into community use.

Certain requirements have to be fulfilled in order to get this permit. Indian citizens who are not resident in these areas need an Inner Line Permit (ILP) to enter these places. The Inner Line Permit is significantly easier to get. In addition, the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order 1963 states that a Restricted Area Permit (RAP) is required for non-Indians to visit certain areas in India. As of 2009, RAP are required for all visits to the Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and parts of the state of Sikkim. Unlike PAP, RAP are generally available for individual travellers and can be issued by overseas embassies or even, in some cases such as Port Blair's Vir Savarkar Airport, on the spot. Indian citizens do not need special permission to visit Restricted Areas. General Protected Area Permit requirements * Tourists have to travel in groups of at least 2 * They have to travel with a registered travel agent * In some areas only certain entry/exit points are allowed. In certain areas non- Indians cannot enter at all * Citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh, China and Myanmar can get the PAP only with approval of the Ministry of Home Affairs Normally the PAP has a duration of 10 days, with the option of extending for another 7 days.

Areas for which a RAP is required * All of Andaman and Nicobar Islands * Parts of Sikkim Problems At the moment only a touristic visit is a widely accepted purpose for a non-Indian's visit to a protected area. However, there are also other legitimate reasons why a non- Indian would want to visit these areas, for example if such a person is married to a native person of this area to visit his/her in-laws. As a consequence native people from the concerned areas who are married to a non- Indian or having children of a different nationality cannot settle permanently in their native area with their family because it is not possible to get a permanent permit for their non-Indian family-members.

Murderous Passions: The Delirious Cinema of Jes√∫s Franco. Strange Attractor Press. p. 65. . It stars Howard Vernon as the mad Dr. Orloff (sometimes spelled Orlof) who wants to repair his disfigured daughter's face with skin grafts from other women with the aid of a slavish, blind henchman named Morpho. The film is considered to be the earliest Spanish horror film.Hortelano, 2011. p. 221 Howard Vernon continued to appear in a number of Franco's horror films up until his death. Franco would later feature a number of blind or disfigured henchmen also named Morpho in many of his later horror films, such as Vampyros Lesbos and Revenge in the House of Usher. Cast Production While filming his tribute to Hollywood musical films (Vampiresas 1930), director Jes√∫s Franco convinced his producers to watch the British film The Brides of Dracula (1960). After the screening, Franco proposed that he could make similar films \\"in the same vein, but with a different style\\". Franco eventually convinced the same French co-producer who produced Vampiresas 1930. Franco was concerned how the film would be handled by Spanish censors. As a result, he produced two versions of the film, one that was unedited and one that was for British and Spanish audiences that had the scenes with nudity in them cut.Shipka, 2011. p. 176 Spanish censors were also concerned with films that would damage the reputation of Spain. To avoid this, Franco set the film in France.

A sequel to the film, titled El Secreto del Dr. Orloff and also directed by Franco, was released in 1964. Reception The film received a negative reception from critics on its initial release. In 1964, a review in the New York Times for a double feature of The Horrible Dr. Hichcock and The Awful Dr. Orloff stated \\"For once, the adjectives in the titles were not only descriptive but also accurate.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin described the film \\"at once appalling and unique, so bad as to be almost enjoyable for its ludicrous qualities, so singular that curiosity hunters are likely to look at it agog.\\" The review noted that one or two shots were \\"worthy of James Whale or Epstein\\" and that the score was \\"quasi-musical noises.\\" The review concluded that it was \\"a singular film...really most extraordinary.\\" From retrospective reviews, Donald C. Willis described the film as one of many \\"mainly trivial variations on Eyes Without a Face\\", while praising the \\"lighting of the castle and the night exteriors\\". In Phil Hardy's book Science Fiction (1984), he stated that The Awful Dr. Orloff was declared as \\"the initiator of an entire subgenre mixing horror and medical Science Fiction in a gory way bordering on the pornographic\\".

A former trash company supervisor, Gilyard is believed to have raped and murdered at least 13 women and girls from 1977 to 1993. He was convicted of six counts of murder on March 16, 2007. Early life Gilyard's background was dysfunctional; his father, Lorenzo Gilyard (February 24, 1927 ‚Äì October 24, 1999) was convicted of rape in 1970, his brother Darryl E. (also Daryle born February 12, 1953) and his brothers friend. He was convicted of a drug- related murder in 1989 and sentenced to life without parole, and his sister, Patricia D. Dixon (born July 20, 1958), a sex worker, was convicted of the murder of a customer in 1983 and served a 10-year sentence. In his younger years, Gilyard was known to bully and sometimes beat women. Murders Most, if not all, of Gilyard's victims were sex workers. All were found shoeless and dumped in secluded spots around Kansas City, Missouri. Most had cloth or paper towels stuffed into their mouths and ligature marks around their necks. Gilyard was a convicted child molester, having raped the 13-year-old daughter of a friend. Probation records show that from 1969 to 1974 he was suspected of five rapes, but was never convicted. Gilyard became a suspect in 1987 in the murder of Sheila Ingold. A crime lab later linked all 13 victims to one killer using DNA testing. A blood sample Gilyard provided in the 1987 investigation led to the murder charges. Of his known victims, 12 were murdered between 1977 and 1989. After living with Jackie Harris for a short time in Missouri and Los Angeles, they were married in Las Vegas, Nevada, on May 29, 1991, after which he and his wife returned to Los Angeles for over a year. Shortly after his return to Missouri, he murdered his 13th known victim. There have been no attempts yet to tie him to any killings in the Los Angeles area during his various stays between 1987 and 1992, and it is assumed that he stopped killing in 1993. The trial Gilyard was tried on seven first-degree murder charges. The prosecution focused mainly on DNA evidence that criminal forensics experts shows he had sex with the victims around the time they were killed. \\"All the victims have several things in common: all were found dead during the same one and a half year period, all were left in secluded or obstructed locations, all were strangled, all showed signs that they were involved in a struggle, all were missing their shoes and all but one showed distinct signs of sexual intercourse,\\" prosecution attorney Jim Kanatzar said in opening statements to the court.San Francisco Chronicle Gilyard was sentenced to life in prison without parole. He is serving his life sentence in Western Missouri Correctional Center.  Victims  Gilyard was convicted in the murders of: *Catherine M. Barry, 34 *Naomi M. Kelly, 23 *Ann Barnes, 36 *Kellie A. Ford, 20 *Sheila Ingold, 36 *Carmeline Hibbs, 30. He was acquitted of the murder of Angela Mayhew, 19, due to insufficient evidence. Other victims not brought to trial were identified as: *Stacie L.

Before she was promoted to top star status, she was considered as one of top-stars-in-waiting along with former Cosmos Troupe top stars Kei Takashiro and Y≈´ga Yamato, former top star of Moon Troupe Jun Sena, and former top star of Snow Troupe Natsuki Mizu. The last name of her stage name, Aran is from the protagonist of a Korean legend Legend of Ariran. Starting her career in Snow Troupe, she developed her singing and acting alongside Takarazuka legends such as Yu Todoroki, Yoka Wao and Tatsuki Kouju. With the 1996 production of Elisabeth, she became the first to perform the lead role of Der Tod in the understudy performance. Later on, she participated in two Bow Hall performances starring Wao (Grand Shanghai and Wuthering Heights), in which she had prominent roles. In 1998, she had her first Bow Hall lead performance, Icarus. In 1999, Aran formed The Wonder Three along with Hikaru Asami and Kouki Naruse. The trio had a Bow Hall performance under the same name. Although similar trios of younger actresses could also be found at that time in Flower Troupe (Haruno, Sena and Mizu) and Moon Troupe (≈åzora, Kiriya and Yamato), they were the only trio that was considered official. This trio also held the main roles in the special performance of Arch of Triumph; this is the first, and to date, only, instance of the Revue having three casts for one show (the main cast led by Todoroki, the new actor cast led by Rea Ranka, and the special cast led by Asami). In 2000, she was transferred to Star Troupe and became the second man for Ko Minoru, Tatsuki Kouju and Wataru Kozuki. When Kozuki had the lead in A Song for Kingdoms (a variation of the opera Aida) as her top star debut in 2003, Aran was cast as Aida, a role which brought much applause. In the same year, she also held the lead roles in performances of Singin' in the Rain and Ganryuu. Marking the 90th anniversary for the company in 2004, Aran had special appearances in two Cosmos Troupe productions. The first was Lightning in the Daytime, where she replaced Mizu in the Tokyo performance. This was followed by the role of Count Philippe de Chandon in Phantom, where she rejoined former Snow Troupe troupemates Wao and Mari Hanafusa. In 2006, she had a special appearance in the Snow Troupe production of Rose of Versailles. This was both the first and last performance with classmate and former troupe mate Asami since Aran's troupe transfer.
