The perpetrator was subsequently arrested and sentenced to death.Ein Wahnsinniger t√∂tet zehn Menschen, Coburger Zeitung (June 19, 1929)  Massacre  For six years Mogo, a native Sebei, had worked as a squatter on a farm about six miles from Kitale that was owned by a European named Weller. When other workers at the farm raised allegations against him that he was a wizard and used black magic, Mr. Weller refused to renew his contract when it ran out on May 11, 1929, and ordered him to leave the farm. Mogo went to his hut and stayed there, brooding, until the afternoon of May 12, when he seized a spear and killed his wife and baby. He then went to the hut of a man with whom he had a quarrel previously, killed the man and grievously injured another native who was trying to apprehend him. Mogo next proceeded to his daughter's hut with the intent of killing her, fatally stabbing on his way an old woman carrying wood and entering another hut where he murdered two women and two children. Arriving at his daughter's hut he found her absent, and while searching for her in the surrounding area he attacked a group of men herding cattle. Eventually Mogo located his daughter, who was herding goats, and chased her into a forest, where he killed her. Mr. Weller was alerted early on and went to the scene of the murders. He armed two natives on the farm with rifles and ordered them as well as his spear armed Maasai herdsmen to stop the murderer, while he would go to alert police and bring a doctor, but they were too afraid to engage Mogo because of his supposed supernatural powers. When Mr. Weller returned with police they scoured the area until they found Mogo, who was preparing his livestock to move off the farm. He willingly led police to the spots where he had murdered his victims, six women, three men, and three children, demanded collecting his due wages, and was then taken to prison. During his trial Mogo admitted to having committed the murders and tried to justify them by showing that others had called him a wizard and that his wife had refused him food and intercourse. He was declared sane, found guilty of the murder of one of his victims, a woman named Kasenwa, and sentenced to death by hanging. His appeal at the Court of Appeal for Eastern Africa was dismissed.\\"Witchcraft\\" murders, The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (July 6, 1929)Chambers, Robert & Chambers, William: Chamber's Journal; W. & R.

There was a sole survivor, the navigator, from a crew of seven and seventy- nine passengers. Investigators determined the cause of the accident was pilot error leading to controlled flight into terrain. Accident The aircraft departed from Khujand Airport in the afternoon of 15 December 1997. Upon entering the airspace of the Emirate of Sharjah the aircraft began to descend, experiencing turbulence on the way down. Preparing for final approach, the crew did not notice they were too low, and the aircraft crashed into the desert approximately east of Sharjah Airport. All 79 passengers were killed (although one survived the crash, only to later die in hospital) along with 6 of the crew. The sole survivor was identified as the flight navigator, 37-year-old Sergei Petrov. The International Civil Aviation Organization suggested the probable cause was \\"The pilot descended below the assigned altitude and unintentionally continued a descent into terrain. Contributing factors were self-induced stress, slight turbulence and non-adherence to operating procedures\\". The president of the Tajikistan State Air Company, who had chartered the flight, claimed that an explosion had taken place on the aircraft prior to the crash, but there was no evidence to support this. Aftermath The President of Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov, offered condolences to his Tajik counterpart Emomalii Rahmon after the crash. All 85 victims were from Khujand; the coffins were flown back there for burial. As many as 3,000 people gathered in the main square of Khujand for the mourning, while Tajik Prime Minister, Yahyo Azimov, spoke of \\"a dreadful tragedy\\".

Background  By the time the revolution began, Batangas was already a hotspot for revolutionary activities, and as a consequent result it was one of the first provinces that declared independence from Spain and joined the Katipunan. The Spanish then conducted offensives against Filipino rebel encampments in the province but failed.  Battle  General Emilio Aguinaldo was already winning battles in Cavite province, and had begun amassing huge throngs of men willing to join the Katipunan. Then he went along with a huge force to Batangas to join with generals Miguel Malvar and Candido Tirona and to amass more men in the province to join the revolution. The Spanish fought hard, but one entire company of theirs was completely destroyed. As a result, the revolutionaries overran the Spanish positions stationed at Talisay then continued to join with the revolutionary army of General Aguinaldo, which he left in Cavite while being assigned to Katipunero generals including Santiago Alvarez to continue the revolution there, after the victory.  Aftermath  To follow up victory, General Malvar then launched a simultaneous attack in the towns of Lemery, Bayungyungan, Calaca, and Taal in the same province, but after suffering heavy losses, called off the attacks.

He served as Ethiopia's Minister of Finance, and chairman of the board of the National Bank of Ethiopia from 1977 to 1982. Early years Teferra Wolde-Semait was born in Sheno, a town located in the Kembibit district of Shewa, Ethiopia, on 11 September 1938. His mother was Jemanesh Bedane and his father was Wolde-Semait Maremi. He was the youngest of five children, the others being Tegegn, Bekele, Tirunesh and Zenebech. Shortly after his birth, his father, who was an arbegna (a resistance fighter) during the Italian occupation, died and Jemanesh fled the area with her children. Teferra was brought to Addis Ababa at an early age, where he entered Priest School and subsequently Haile Selassie I Kokebe Tsebha School, completing 1st through 12th grade with acceleration. After teaching in Wollo for a year, he attended Haile Selassie l University in Addis Ababa and graduated in 1964 with distinction, earning a bachelor's degree in economics. After graduating, he was hired at the Ministry of Community Development and Social Affairs. After working for some years, he travelled to The Hague, Netherlands, to pursue an advanced degree, and obtained a master's degree in Economic Development in 1967. Career Teferra returned to the Ethiopian Ministry of Community Development and Social Affairs, where he formed and managed the planning unit. He spent the years from 1967 to 1971 preparing Ethiopia's long-term development plan as well as the annual budget for the Ministry. He then transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and, from 1972 to 1974, worked in the Embassy of Ethiopia in Washington, D.C. as Counselor of Economics and Finance. While in that role, he worked closely with the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), USAID, and other organizations to boost the aid being given to Ethiopia. Afterwards, he returned to Addis Ababa to manage the Lending and Investment Management unit of the Ministry of Finance where from 1974 to 1975 he worked on foreign assistance as well as government investments in various public enterprises. Teferra became Vice President from 1975 to 1976, and then from 1977 to 1982, Ethiopia's 9th Minister of Finance. While in his position he implemented changes such as reorganizing the Ministry's various departments. Those changes led the way to increased revenue as well as improved budget delivery services, and also resulted in Ethiopia obtaining development aid and loans from international organizations such as the World Bank, African Development Bank, and other countries. At a time when his Government was under international scrutiny, Teferra worked to maintain economic relations with Ethiopia's allies with the aim to preserve Ethiopia's economic interest without pursuing political acceptance. Teferra was the chairman of the board of the National Bank of Ethiopia during his years as Minister of Finance, effectively making him the country's overall Monetary and Finance chief. In addition to the above-mentioned job responsibilities, Teferra served as a board member in the National Planning Commission, Economy and Law committees, Telecommunications, National Coffee, Cattle Breeding and Beef, and Ethiopian Airlines committees.

On 29 August 1998, the aircraft operating the flight, a Tupolev Tu-154M overran the runway, smashing buildings and crashed into a soccer field in Quito while taking off from the airport. The aircraft burst into flames and 70 people on board were killed. A total of 10 people on the ground, including children, were killed. Investigation committee conducted by the Ecuadorian Direcci√≥n General de Aviaci√≥n Civil, concluded that the crash was caused due to mechanical failure that led to an aborted take off. The crew forgot to select the switches for the hydraulic valves of the control system. While rolling for take-off, the plane didn't rotate. A rejected take off occurred and Flight 389 overran the runway. The crash remains as the second deadliest crash in Ecuador, after a Boeing 737-200 crashed in Cuenca in 1983. Accident Flight 389 was preparing for departure. During the first engine start, a pneumatic valve was blocked. The problem was rectified and two engines were started with ground power. During its taxi, the third engine was started. Flight 389 later obtained their take-off clearance and started their roll. The first and the second take-off attempt failed. It then attempted its third take off. When Flight 389 reached Vr speed, the nose of the aircraft wouldn't lift (rotate). Even though the crew initiated a rejected take-off, the aircraft overran the runway, narrowly missed the heavily traveled avenue at the end of the airport runway in a middle-class residential neighborhood, slammed a wall, clipped an auto mechanic shop, smashed into two houses and plowed into a soccer field. At the time, many people including children were playing on the field. The aircraft exploded and burst into flames. Rescuers reached the crash site and started to evacuate survivors from the crash site. Explosions could be heard repeatedly after the crash. Firefighters jets of water on the smoking ruins to prevent additional explosions and local authorities cordoned off the crash site and searched for a missing local resident. Many people on the ground went missing in the crash. A mother stated that her three children were missing after the crash. 26 injured people were rushed to three hospitals, with 15 of them onto the Quito Metropolitan Hospital. Survivors stated that some doors on the plane wouldn't open after impact and several survivors escaped from the fiery wreckage through a hole in the fuselage. Several people jumped on the plane while they were on fire. On Sunday, 30 August, Ecuadorian Red Cross stated that as many as 77 badly burned bodies have been recovered from the crash site. Five children playing on the field were killed as the plane plowed onto them. Aircraft, passengers and crew The aircraft was a Tupolev Tu-154M, serial number 85A720 and registered in Cuba as CU-T1264. The aircraft was carrying 91 people, consisting of 14 crew and 77 passengers. Most of the occupants were Ecuadorians, with some Argentinians, Italians, Jamaicans, Chileans and Cubans. Aftermath Shortly after the crash, Mariscal Sucre International Airport was closed and every flight operations were cancelled in response to the crash. Ecuadorian President Jamil Mahuad visited the crash site and expressed his solidarity to the next of kin and relatives of the victims of the crash. He ordered a full report into the cause of the crash and stated that he would build a new airport away from the city. The present site had been criticised for being too close to a densely populated area. A Red Cross worker stated that the accident was evidence of the riskiness of the airport situated in the northern part of the Andean city in a highly populated zone.

On 28 June 1982, the flight crashed south of Mozyr, Belorussian SSR, killing all 132 people on board. The accident was both the first and deadliest crash of a Yakovlev Yak-42, and remains the deadliest aviation accident in Belarus. The cause was a failure of the jackscrew controlling the horizontal stabilizer due to a design flaw.  Aircraft and crew  The Yakovlev Yak-42 involved in the accident was registered to Aeroflot as CCCP-42529 (manufacturer number 11040104, series number 04-01). The aircraft made its maiden flight on 21 April 1981 and was delivered to Ministry of Civil Aviation on 1 June 1981. At the time of the accident it had only 795 flight hours and 496 takeoff and landing cycles. All 124 passenger seats were filled, 11 of them were filled by children. The cockpit crew consisted of: * Captain Vyacheslav Nikolaevich Musinsky * Co- pilot Alexandr Sergeevich Stigarev * Navigator-trainee Viktor Ivanovich Kedrov * Flight engineer Nikolai Semenovich Vinogradov  Sequence of events  The aircraft took off from Pulkovo Airport at 9:01 Moscow time, having been delayed one minute because of a late passenger. At 10:45 it entered the zone of Kiev/Boryspil air traffic control Center. The crew started the landing checklist at 10:48:01. At 10:48:58 the crew informed the air traffic controller they reached the planned top of descent point, the controller clearing them for descent to FL255 (7750 m). The crew confirmed the flight path; no further communications were heard from Flight 8641. At 10:51:20 the autopilot gradually brought about a horizontal stabilizer angle of up 0.3¬∞ for descent for landing. At 10:51:30 the stabilizer angle sharply increased, exceeding the 2¬∞ limit within half a second. The sudden change resulted in a negative g-force of -1.5 g, but the autopilot adjusted the controls to lower it to -0.6 g. As the stabilizer did not respond to commands and the plane went on diving, the autopilot switched off after 3 seconds. The pilots pulled back on the yoke trying to level out the plane, but it continued into a steep dive; soon it rolled 35¬∞ left and the dive achieved 50¬∞. As it rolled counterclockwise with over -2 g of overload, the aircraft disintegrated at 10:51:50 at the altitude of 5700 m and the instrument speed 810 km/h. The wreckage was found on the outskirts of Verbavychi village, 10 km southeast of the district center Naroulia (itself being further 18 km south/west of the larger Mozyr which is often listed.) Fragments of the plane were scattered across an area of 6.5 by 3.5 km. All 132 people onboard perished.  Cause  The cause was determined to be a failure of the jackscrew mechanism in the aircraft's tail due to metal fatigue, which resulted from flaws in the Yak-42's design. The investigation concluded that among the causes of the crash were poor maintenance, as well as the control system of the stabilizer not meeting basic aviation standards. Three engineers who signed the jackscrew drawings were convicted. As for the official cause of the crash: \\"the spontaneous movement of the stabilizer was due to disconnection in flight of the jackscrew assembly due to the almost complete deterioration of the 42M5180-42 thread-nuts due to structural imperfections in the mechanism.\\" Due to the accident, all Yak-42s were withdrawn from service until the design defect was rectified in October 1984.Gordon, Komissarov and Komissarov 2005, p. 315.

Life and works The name Majestatis is a notname assigned to the artist or workshop; it is possible that the an atelier rather than a single artist was responsible for the works attributed to Majestatis. Art historian Johnny Roosval coined the name in the 20th century. It derives from a subject often used by the artist, Christ in Majesty sitting on a rainbow and surrounded by a mandorla and angels. No written sources exist about the life or background of the artist, but it has been speculated that Majestatis was trained in Burgundy or Alsace or may have come from there. Majestatis initially seems to have worked in Scania, probably for the local nobility and possibly the (at the time Danish) royal family. Majestatis appears to have worked at the construction site of Lund Cathedral. Later Majestatis seems to have moved to Gotland. The chef d'oeuvre of Majestatis is the baptismal font of the church of Tryde, Scania, Sweden. The sculptures probably depict, apart from a scene with Christ in Majesty, the legend of St. Stanislaw. It is probable that the motive has some connection to, and the font may even have been commissioned by, the then reigning queen of Denmark (as Scania was then a part of Denmark), queen Sophia, spouse of Valdemar I of Denmark. Sophia had Polish ancestors and not least for that reason the creation of the font has been connected with the royal family. Another theory is that the carvings on the font depict the legend of Saint Fridolin. The font from Tryde was displayed at the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris, and awarded a bronze medal. Majestatis made an additional four or possibly five baptismal fonts for churches in Scania; these were probably all made for local noblemen as they display a high degree of refinement. This group of fonts include the fonts in L√∂derup, √ñstra Hoby, Valleberga and Simris churches, and possibly √ñstra N√∂bbel√∂v. They are all located in the south-eastern part of the province. The baptismal fonts and other stone sculpture identified to be by Majestatis on Gotland island are of a later date than those in Scania. Perhaps the best of the sculptor's works on Gotland is the northern portal of Hablingbo Church. Other works include baptismal fonts in Lokrume, Vall, Sproge, Stenkyrka, V√§skinde and Gerum churches, as well as a few others, for example in Denmark and H√§lsingland, Sweden. Stylistically, Majestatis is recognisable through his elongated figures with well-kept, often braided hair, pear-shaped faces and large, rather pointed, oval eyes. The sculptor is known for the profusely adorned, but not overdecorated, baptismal fonts.

The fair was originally chosen to coincide with the Feast of Saint Faith the Virgin on 6 October,British History Online: Markets and Fairs a Gallo-Romano saint with a strong following in the area, but in 1207 a license was awarded for the fair to be held several days later, on the Vigil of the Feast of the Holy Trinity and the eight days thereafter. It is, however, unclear whether the date of the fair was actually changed, and according to records held in the library of Chichester Cathedral, as late as the 18th Century the Court of Piepowders that was held on the occasion of the fair took place between the Feast of Saint Faith and the Eve of Saint Edward the Confessor, on 12 October. The name \\"Sloe Fair\\" is believed to be a reference to a sloe tree that grew on the original site of the fair, in a field just outside Chichester's North Gate. In its heyday, the fair attracted traders and visitors from across Southern England. Though the specific form of the event has changed over the centuries, the Sloe Fair continues to be held in the modern era. The Sloe Fair was not held during World War II and during the hostilities a caravan was placed at the site at which the fair is held, to prevent the right to hold a fair from lapsing. The modern Sloe Fair is organized by the Showmen's Guild of Great Britain and the main attractions are mechanical fairground rides. In 2009, it was reported in the local press that the Showmens' Guild's right to hold the Sloe Fair stood in the way of proposals to construct a multi-storey car park on the site of Northgate carpark, where the fair is held.Ancient sloe fair rights may halt multi-storey car park In Chichester In 2020 the Sloe Fair was not held for the first time since World War 2 with the exception of a small non-operating ride due to a walk in by appointment Covid-19 test centre being put in the car park.

It became one of the more successful and better known VIA bands, recording a number of hits and serving as a springboard to fame for several Russian musicians, including Dmitry Malikov, Vladimir Presnyakov Sr., and Alexander Barykin.  History  The band Samotsvety, was founded by Yuriy Malikov, a Recognized National Artist of Russia and the father of Dmitry Malikov. The group produced a string of hits in the 1970s, including \\"Moy adres Sovetskii Soyuz\\" (My address is the Soviet Union), \\"Tam, za oblakami\\" (There, beyond the clouds), \\"Vsya zhizn vperedi\\" (My whole life is still ahead), \\"Ne povtoriayetsia takoye nikogda\\" (Something like this will never happen again), \\"Vse chto v zhizni yest u menia\\" (All that I have in my life), \\"Shkonliy bal\\" (School dance), and \\"Ne zemlie zhivet liubov\\" (There lives love on this earth), among others. The year 1975 was a turning point for the band. It was the year they recorded \\"Esli budem my vdvoyem\\" (If it will be the two of us), which became a massive hit and topped the charts in the former Soviet Union. The same year, an album released in Berlin, Germany called \\"Famous world bands\\" featured this Samotsvety song alongside hits by the Beatles, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Shocking Blue. In 1975 Samotsvety also acquired two musical talents that would remain with them through the years, the husband-and-wife team of Vladimir Presnyakov, Sr. and Elena Presnyakova. The band broke up in the late 1980s when many VIAs were going away as a result of changes in both government censorship and popular tastes. However, in 1996, Yuriy Malikov decided to celebrate the 25-year anniversary of the band by bringing together many of the ex-members for an episode of the television series \\"Zolotoy shlyager\\" (Golden hit). The unexpected popularity of the program when it aired made Malikov decide to reconstitute the band. The band successfully resumed its musical career, touring with a program that combined old hits with new releases. The band's new songs included \\"Proshlogodniye glaza\\" (Last year's eyes), \\"Regtaim na Titanike\\" (Ragtime on the Titanic), and \\"Sneg Rozhdestva\\" (Christmas Snow).

He often depicted scena galante in 17th-century garb as well as orientalist themes, which appealed to the American and British buyers. He was active in restoration of antique canvases. He also painted portraits including the King Umberto I and his wife. After the early 1880s, he lost vision due to an ophthalmic malady, and stopped painting. Short biography on Glisenti.

The house is registered as part of Johannesburg's historical heritage. Description Desmond Tutu and his family moved into this house in 1975. Vilakazi Street is said to be the only street in the world where two Nobel Laureates have lived. During the time that Tutu lived here he became a Nobel Laureate for his struggles against Apartheid and he led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission for President Nelson Mandela. Tutu did not need to live here, as he had been offered the dean's residence in the rich white suburb of Houghton, but Tutu was keen not to be seen as an \\"honorary white\\" so he lived twelve miles from the centre of the city. Conditions were poor in Soweto, which was the largest urban development in South Africa with over a million inhabitants but only one public telephone for every 26,000 inhabitants. Only 15% had electricity and 75% did not have running water when they first moved in. Black Africans were not allowed to own homes in Soweto as they were meant to see themselves as temporary workers. Plaque unveiled by the Bishop in 2011 The house was extended by Jo Noero in 1990, the same architect who had worked at the Anglican Church in the Transvaal. Tutu was still living there in October 2011. A blue plaque was installed on the Tutu house in 2011 as part of the Johannesburg heritage trail by what was then called the Simon van de Stel Foundation. Vilakazi Street attracts thousands of tourists since Mandela House was opened to the public in 1997, quickly becoming a top-twenty tourist destination.

The station occupied an plot bounded by Seventh and Eighth Avenues and 31st and 33rd Streets in Midtown Manhattan. As the terminal shared its name with several stations in other cities, it was sometimes called New York Pennsylvania Station, or Penn Station for short. The building was designed by McKim, Mead, and White and completed in 1910, enabling direct rail access to New York City from the south for the first time. Its head house and train shed were considered a masterpiece of the Beaux-Arts style and one of the great architectural works of New York City. The station contained 11 platforms serving 21 tracks, in approximately the same layout as the current Penn Station. The original building was one of the first stations to include separate waiting rooms for arriving and departing passengers, and when built, these were among the city's largest public spaces. Passenger traffic began to decline after World War II, and in the 1950s, the Pennsylvania Railroad sold the air rights to the property and shrank the railroad station. Starting in 1963, the above-ground head house and train shed were demolished, a loss that galvanized the modern historic preservation movement in the United States. Over the next six years, the below-ground concourses and waiting areas were heavily renovated, becoming the modern Penn Station, while Madison Square Garden and Pennsylvania Plaza were built above them. The sole remaining portions of the original station are the underground platforms and tracks, as well as scattered artifacts on the mezzanine level above it.  History  = Planning = Pennsylvania Station, Plate 20 from: Bromley, George W. and Bromley, Walter S. Atlas of the City of New York Borough of Manhattan. Volume Two. (Philadelphia: G. W. Bromley and Co., 1920) Until the early 20th century, the Pennsylvania Railroad's (PRR) rail network terminated on the western side of the Hudson River, once known locally as the North River, at Exchange Place in Jersey City, New Jersey. Manhattan-bound passengers boarded ferries to cross the Hudson River for the final stretch of their journey. The rival New York Central Railroad's (NYC) line transported passengers from the Hudson Valley in the city's north, ran along Park Avenue in Manhattan, and terminated at Grand Central Depot (later Grand Central Terminal) at 42nd Street and Park Avenue. Many proposals for a cross-Hudson connection were advanced in the late 19th century, but financial panics in the 1870s and 1890s scared off potential investors. In any event, none of the proposals advanced during this time were considered feasible. The PRR considered building a rail bridge across the Hudson, but the state of New York insisted that a cross-Hudson bridge had to be a joint project with other New Jersey railroads, which were not interested. The alternative was to tunnel under the river, but steam locomotives could not use such a tunnel due to the accumulation of pollution in a closed space, and the New York State Legislature prohibited steam locomotives in Manhattan after July 1, 1908. The idea of a Midtown Manhattan railroad hub was first formulated in 1901, when the Pennsylvania Railroad took interest in a new railroad approach recently completed in Paris. In the Parisian railroad scheme, electric locomotives were substituted for steam locomotives prior to the final approach into the city. PRR President Alexander Johnston Cassatt adapted this method for the New York City area in the form of the New York Tunnel Extension project. He created and led the overall planning effort for it. The PRR, which had been working with the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) on the Tunnel Extension plans, made plans to acquire majority control of the LIRR so that one new terminal could be built in Manhattan, rather than two. right The project was to include New York Penn Station; the North River Tunnels, crossing the Hudson River to the west; and the East River Tunnels, crossing the East River to the east. The original proposal for the terminal, which was published in June 1901, called for the construction of a bridge across the Hudson River between 45th and 50th Streets in Manhattan, as well as two closely spaced terminals for the LIRR and PRR. This would allow passengers to travel between Long Island and New Jersey without having to switch trains. In December 1901, the plans were modified so that the PRR would construct the North River Tunnels under the Hudson River, instead of a bridge over it. The PRR cited costs and land value as a reason for constructing a tunnel rather than a bridge, since the cost of a tunnel would be one-third that of a bridge. The New York Tunnel Extension was quickly opposed by the New York City Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners who objected that they would not have jurisdiction over the new tunnels, as well as from the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which saw the New York Tunnel Extension as a potential competitor to its as-yet-incomplete rapid transit service. The city had initially declined to give the PRR a franchise because city officials believed that the PRR needed to grant thirteen concessions to protect city interests; the PRR ultimately conceded to nine of the city's requests. The project was approved by the New York City Board of Aldermen in December 1902, by a 41-36 vote. The North and East River Tunnels were to be built under the riverbed of their respective rivers. The PRR and LIRR lines would converge at what would become New York Penn Station, an \\"immense passenger station\\" on the east side of 8th Avenue between 31st and 33rd Streets in Manhattan. The entire project was expected to cost over $100 million. Cassatt's design for New York Penn Station was inspired by the Gare d'Orsay, a Beaux-Arts style station in Paris, though he planned for the new terminal to be twice as large. He commissioned Charles McKim of the New York architectural firm McKim, Mead & White to design the terminal. McKim envisioned a space that would celebrate \\"the entrance to one of the great metropolitan cities of the world.\\" He studied the role of public buildings in Ancient Rome, including the Baths of Diocletian. Cassatt and McKim collaborated closely to define the structure of the station. Their original plan called for a structure measuring long by wide, with three floors open to passengers and 25 tracks. As part of the terminal's construction, the PRR proposed that the United States Postal Service construct a post office across from the station on the west side of 8th Avenue. In February 1903, the U.S. government accepted the PRR's proposal and made plans to construct what would later become the Farley Post Office, which was also designed by McKim, Mead & White. The PRR would also build a train storage yard in Queens east of Penn Station, to be used by both PRR trains from the west and LIRR trains from the east. The yard's purpose was to store passenger-train cars at the beginning or end of their trips, as well as to reverse the direction of the locomotives that pulled these train cars. = Construction = Land purchases for the station started in late 1901 or early 1902. The PRR purchased a site bounded by Seventh and Ninth Avenues between 31st and 33rd Streets. This site was chosen over other sites farther east, such as Herald Square, because these parts of Manhattan were already congested. Penn Station proper would be located along the eastern part of the site between Seventh and Eighth Avenue. The northwestern block, bounded by Eighth Avenue, Ninth Avenue, 32nd Street, and 33rd Street, was not part of the original plan. The condemnation of seventeen city-owned buildings on the terminal's future site, an area of four blocks, was begun in June 1903. All 304 parcels within the four-block area, which were collectively owned by between 225 and 250 entities, had been purchased by November 1903. The PRR purchased land west of Ninth Avenue in April 1904, such that it owned all the land between Seventh and Tenth Avenues from 31st to 33rd Street. This land would allow the PRR to build extra railroad switches for the tracks around Penn Station. The PRR also purchased land along the north side of the future station between 33rd and 34th Streets, so the company could create a pedestrian walkway leading directly to 34th Street, a major crosstown thoroughfare. The properties between 33rd and 34th Street that the PRR had purchased were transferred to PRR ownership in 1908. Clearing the site entailed \\"displacing thousands of residents from the largely African-American community in what was once known as the Tenderloin district in Manhattan.\\" A $5 million contract to excavate the site was awarded in June 1904, marking the start of the actual construction process. Overall, some 500 buildings had to be demolished to make way for the station. Even as excavation proceeded, the federal government was still deciding whether to build a post office next to the PRR station. The PRR planned to turn over the air rights to the blocks between Eighth and Ninth Avenues to the federal government once excavations were completed. However, the PRR would still own the land below the post office leading some Congress members to oppose the post office plan, as they believed that the government would only own \\"a chunk of space in the air\\" above the tracks. The Postmaster of New York City, William Russell Willcox, ultimately approved the post office anyway. McKim, Mead & White, which had designed Penn Station, was selected to design the post office in 1908. By this time, the excavations were near completion and the structural steel for the post office building was being laid. In June 1906, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad applied for and received a franchise to operate trains from the northeastern suburbs of New York City to New York Penn Station. The New Haven would be able to accomplish this by constructing a spur from the four-track New Haven Railroad and New York Central Railroad main line in the Bronx (these railroads are now respectively the modern-day New Haven Line and Harlem Line of the Metro-North Railroad). The spur, now the Port Morris Branch, would split north of Melrose station in the South Bronx, then merge with the Harlem River and Port Chester Railroad (HR&PC; now part of the Northeast Corridor) just north of the Harlem River. The HR&PC; would pass from the Bronx to Queens via the Hell Gate Bridge, then continue south through Queens, eventually connecting to the East River Tunnels and Penn Station. The North River and East River Tunnels ran almost in a straight line between Queens and New Jersey, interrupted only by the proposed Pennsylvania Railroad station. The technology for the tunnels connecting to Penn Station was so innovative that the PRR shipped an actual diameter section of the new East River Tunnels to the Jamestown Exposition in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1907, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the nearby founding of the colony at Jamestown. The same tube, with an inscription indicating that it had been displayed at the Exposition, was later installed under water and remains in use. Construction was completed on the Hudson River tunnels on October 9, 1906, and on the East River tunnels on March 18, 1908. Construction also progressed on Penn Station during this time. Workers began laying the stonework for the station in June 1908; they had completed it thirteen months later. New York Penn Station was officially declared complete on August 29, 1910. A small portion of Penn Station was opened nearly two weeks later, on September 8, in conjunction with the opening of the East River Tunnels. As a result, LIRR riders gained direct railroad service to Manhattan. Prior to the opening of Penn Station, LIRR riders entered Manhattan via the 34th Street Ferry Terminal, where they could transfer to an elevated shuttle station. The rest of the station opened on November 27, 1910. One hundred thousand people visited the station during its first day of full service, excluding the 25,000 commuters and intercity riders. With the station's full opening, the PRR became the only railroad to enter New York City from the south. At the station's completion, the total project cost to the Pennsylvania Railroad for the station and associated tunnels was $114 million (equivalent to $ billion in ), according to an Interstate Commerce Commission report. The railroad paid tribute to Cassatt, who died in 1906, with a statue designed by Adolph Alexander Weinman in the station's grand arcade. An inscription below it read: The statue is now in the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania. = Operation = One of the early electric locomotives arrives at Penn Station, ca. 1910 When Penn Station first opened, it had a capacity of 144 trains per hour on its 21 tracks and 11 platforms. At the start of operations, there were 1,000 trains scheduled every weekday: of these, 600 were LIRR trains, while the other 400 were PRR trains. The commuting times of LIRR riders were cut by up to a half- hour. The station was so heavily used that the PRR soon added 51 trains to its daily schedule. The station also served New Haven trains to Westchester County and Connecticut after the Hell Gate Bridge opened in 1917. During half a century of operation, many intercity passenger trains arrived and departed daily to Chicago and St. Louis, where passengers could make connections to other railroads. Along with Long Island Rail Road trains, Penn Station saw trains of the New Haven and the Lehigh Valley Railroads. A side effect of the tunneling project was to open the city up to the suburbs, and within 10 years of opening, two-thirds of the daily passengers coming through Penn Station were commuters. The station put the Pennsylvania Railroad at a comparative advantage to its competitors offering service to the west and south. The Baltimore & Ohio (B&O;), Central of New Jersey (CNJ), Erie, and the Lackawanna railroads began their routes at terminals in New Jersey, requiring travelers bound for New York City to use ferries or the interstate Hudson Tubes to traverse the Hudson River. During World War I and the early 1920s, the rival B&O; passenger trains to Washington, D.C., Chicago, and St. Louis also used Penn Station, initially by order of the United States Railroad Administration, until the Pennsylvania Railroad terminated the B&O;'s access in 1926. Atypically for a public building, Penn Station was well maintained during its heyday. Such was the station's status that whenever the President of the United States arrived in New York by rail, he would arrive and depart on tracks 11 and 12. Royalty and leaders of other countries also traveled via Penn Station. A train approaching the station from New Jersey, 1910 Over the next few decades, alterations were made to Penn Station to increase its capacity. The LIRR concourse, waiting room, amenities and platforms were expanded. Connections were provided to the New York City Subway stations at Seventh Avenue and Eighth Avenue. The electrification of Penn Station was initially third rail, which provided 600 volts of direct current. It was later changed to 11,000-volt alternating current overhead catenary when electrification of PRR's mainline was extended to Washington, D.C., in the early 1930s. The expansion of electrification also allowed the PRR to begin running electric-powered commuter trains from Trenton via Newark starting in 1933; previously, steam-powered commuter trains continued to originate and terminate at Exchange Place. By 1935, Penn Station had served over a billion passengers. A Greyhound Lines bus terminal was built to the north of Penn Station, facing 34th Street, in 1935. However, within a decade, the bus terminal had gone into decline, and was frequented by low-level criminals and the homeless. The Greyhound bus terminal soon saw competition from the Port Authority Bus Terminal, located seven blocks north of Penn Station. Opened in 1950, it was intended to consolidate bus service. Greyhound resisted for almost a decade afterward, but by 1962 it had closed the Penn Station bus terminal and moved to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The station was busiest during World War II: in 1945, more than 100 million passengers traveled through Penn Station. The station's decline came soon afterward with the beginning of the Jet Age and the construction of the Interstate Highway System. However, the station had already gone into decline as early as the 1930s, and by the 1950s its ornate pink granite exterior had become coated with grime. The PRR recorded its first-ever annual operating losses in 1947, and intercity rail passenger volumes continued to decline dramatically over the next decade. A renovation in the late 1950s covered some of the grand columns with plastic and blocked off the spacious central hallway with the \\"Clamshell\\", a new ticket office designed by Lester C. Tichy. Architectural critic Lewis Mumford wrote in The New Yorker in 1958 that \\"nothing further that could be done to the station could damage it\\". Advertisements surrounded the station's Seventh Avenue concourse, while stores and restaurants were crammed around the Eighth Avenue side's mezzanine. A layer of dirt covered the interior and exterior of the structure, and the pink granite was stained with gray. Another architectural critic, Ada Louise Huxtable, wrote in The New York Times in 1963: \\"The tragedy is that our own times not only could not produce such a building, but cannot even maintain it.\\" = Demolition = Seen in 1962 The Pennsylvania Railroad optioned the air rights of New York Penn Station to real estate developer William Zeckendorf in 1954. He had previously suggested that the two-block site of the main building could be used for a \\"world trade center\\". The option allowed for the demolition of the main building and train shed, which could be replaced by an office and sports complex. The station's underground platforms and tracks would not be modified, but the station's mezzanines would be reconfigured. A blueprint for a \\"Palace of Progress\\" was released in 1955 but was not acted upon. Plans for the new Madison Square Garden above Penn Station were announced in 1962 by Irving M. Felt, the president of Graham-Paige, the company that purchased the air rights to Penn Station. In exchange for the air rights, the Pennsylvania Railroad would get a brand-new, air-conditioned, smaller station completely below street level at no cost, and a 25 percent stake in the new Madison Square Garden Complex. A 28-story hotel and 34-story office building, now part of Penn Plaza, would be built on the eastern side of the block, facing Seventh Avenue. The arena proper would take up most of the block, facing Eighth Avenue to the west. At the time, one argument made in favor of the old Penn Station's demolition was that the cost of maintaining the structure had become prohibitive. Its grand scale made the PRR devote a \\"fortune\\" to its upkeep, and the head house's exterior had become somewhat grimy. Those who opposed demolition considered whether it made sense to preserve a building, intended to be a cost-effective and functional piece of the city's infrastructure, simply as a monument to the past. As a New York Times editorial critical of the demolition noted at the time, \\"any city gets what it wants, is willing to pay for, and ultimately deserves.\\" Modern architects rushed to save the ornate building, although it was contrary to their own styles. They called the station a treasure and chanted \\"Don't Amputate ‚Äì Renovate\\" at rallies. Despite the controversy generated over the demolition, Felt stated that he \\"believed that the gain from the new buildings and sports center would more than offset any aesthetic loss.\\" He elaborated, \\"Fifty years from now, when it's time for [Madison Square Garden] to be torn down, there will be a new group of architects who will protest.\\" Despite large public opposition to Penn Station's demolition, the New York City Department of City Planning voted in January 1963 to start demolishing the station that summer. Architects protested against the decision, but to no effect. Demolition of the station in 1966 Under the leadership of PRR president Stuart T. Saunders (who later headed Penn Central Transportation), demolition of the above-ground station house began on October 28, 1963. A giant steel deck was placed above the tracks and platforms, allowing rail service to continue with only minor disruptions. This was possible because most of the rail infrastructure, including the waiting room, concourses and platforms, was below street level. Around five hundred columns were sunk into the platforms, while passengers were routed around work areas surrounded by plywood. Madison Square Garden and two office towers were built above the extensively renovated concourses and waiting area. The first girders for Madison Square Garden were placed in late 1965, and by summer 1966, much of the station had been demolished except for the Seventh Avenue entrance. By late 1966, much of the new station had been built. There were three new entrances: one from 31st Street and Eighth Avenue, another from 33rd Street and Eighth Avenue, and a third from a driveway running mid-block between Seventh and Eighth Avenues from 31st to 33rd Streets. Permanent electronic signs were being erected, shops were being renovated, new escalators were being installed, and platforms that were temporarily closed during renovations had been reopened. A 1968 advertisement depicted architect Charles Luckman's model of the final plan for the Madison Square Garden Center complex.  Impact  Although the demolition of the head house was justified as progressive at a time of declining rail passenger service, it also created international outrage. As the dismantling of the structure began, The New York Times editorial board wrote, \\"Until the first blow fell, no one was convinced that Penn Station really would be demolished, or that New York would permit this monumental act of vandalism against one of the largest and finest landmarks of its age of Roman elegance.\\" New York Times reporter Eddie Hausner's photograph of the sculpture Day by Adolph Alexander Weinman, lying in a landfill in the New Jersey Meadowlands, inspired New Jersey Conservation and Economic Development Commissioner Robert A. Roe to salvage some of the head house's sculptures. New York Times architecture critic Michael Kimmelman compared the demolition of the head house unfavorably to that of Lenox Library, destroyed to make way for the Frick Collection, or the old Waldorf‚ÄìAstoria, razed for the construction of the Empire State Building. He claimed that it broke a long tradition of New Yorkers accepting that \\"what replaced a beloved building would be as good or better.\\" The controversy over the original head house's demolition is cited as a catalyst for the architectural preservation movement in the United States, particularly in New York City. In 1965, two years after Penn Station's demolition commenced, the city passed a landmarks preservation act, thereby creating the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. New York City's other major railroad station, Grand Central Terminal, was also proposed for demolition in 1968 by Grand Central's owner, Penn Central. Grand Central Terminal was ultimately preserved by the city's Landmarks Commission, despite an unsuccessful challenge from Penn Central in 1978. = Present day = Amtrak concourse of the modern station The current Penn Station is situated completely underground and is located underneath Madison Square Garden at 33rd Street and Two Penn Plaza. The station spans three levels, with the concourses located on the upper two levels and the train platforms located on the lowest level. The two levels of concourses, while original to the 1910 station, were renovated extensively during the construction of Madison Square Garden, and expanded in subsequent decades. The tracks and platforms are also largely original, except for newer track connections to the West Side Rail Yard and the Amtrak Empire Corridor serving Albany and Buffalo. There are three areas of the station, arranged into separate concourses for Amtrak, NJ Transit (which operates the former PRR commuter lines from New Jersey), and the LIRR. Comparing the new and the old Penn Station, Yale architectural historian Vincent Scully once wrote, \\"One entered the city like a god; one scuttles in now like a rat.\\" Despite having undergone improvements since the 1960s, Penn Station is criticized as a low-ceilinged \\"catacomb\\" lacking charm, especially when compared to the larger and more ornate Grand Central Terminal. The New York Times, in a November 2007 editorial supporting development of an enlarged railroad terminal, said that \\"Amtrak's beleaguered customers ... now scurry through underground rooms bereft of light or character.\\" Times transit reporter Michael M. Grynbaum wrote that Penn Station was \\"the ugly stepchild of the city's two great rail terminals.\\" Along similar lines, Michael Kimmelman wrote in 2019 that while downsizing Penn Station and moving it underground may have made a modicum of sense at the time, in hindsight it was a sign that New York was \\"disdainful of its gloried architectural past.\\" He also claimed that the remodeled station is not commensurate with its status as the main rail gateway to New York. In the early 1990s, U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan began to champion a plan to rebuild a replica of the historic Penn Station; he had shined shoes in the original station during the Great Depression. He proposed building it in the nearby Farley Post Office building. In 1999 Senator Charles Schumer sponsored and passed legislation formally naming the yet-to-be-constructed facility \\"Daniel Patrick Moynihan Station\\" in his honor. The project, since renamed \\"Moynihan Train Hall\\", was split off into two phases. The first phase, the West End Concourse, opened in the eastern part of the former post office in June 2017. The second phase which consists of expanding Penn Station's facilities into parts of the post office itself is expected to open in 2022.  Architecture and design  right Occupying two city blocks from Seventh Avenue to Eighth Avenue and from 31st to 33rd Streets, the original Pennsylvania Station building had frontages of along the side streets and long along the main avenues. It covered an area of . Over of dirt had been excavated during construction. The original structure was made of of pink granite, of interior stone, of steel, of brick, and 30,000 light bulbs. At the time of Penn Station's completion, The New York Times called it \\"the largest building in the world ever built at one time\\". = Exterior = The exterior of Penn Station was marked by an imposing, sober colonnade of Roman unfluted columns based on the classical Greek Doric order. These columns, in turn, were modeled after landmarks such as the Acropolis of Athens. The rest of the facade was modeled on St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, as well as the Bank of England headquarters. The colonnades embodied the sophisticated integration of multiple functions and the circulation of people and goods. McKim, Mead & White's design combined glass-and-steel train sheds and a magnificently proportioned concourse with a monumental entrance to New York City. The building had entrances from all four sides. Twin carriageways from the streets, modeled after Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, led to the two railroads served by the station. One carriageway led from the north side of the building, serving LIRR trains, while the other led from the south side, serving PRR trains. Above each carriageway entrance was a colonnade.  Entrance arcade  Main Waiting Room, , with bronze statue of PRR President Alexander Johnston Cassatt, in niche on left The main entrance was from a shopping arcade that led westward from the intersection of 7th Avenue and 32nd Street. Two plaques were placed at the station building's Seventh Avenue entrance. One plaque contained inscriptions of the names of individuals who had led the New York Tunnel Extension project, while the other included carvings of franchise dates and the names of contractors. Cassatt wanted to give passengers a cultural experience upon their arrival in New York. He modeled the arcade after those in Milan and Naples, filling it with high-end boutiques and shops. The arcade measured wide, a width similar to that of 32nd Street, and was long. The entrance to this arcade was considered to be the grandest of Penn Station's entrances. The colonnade above this entrance was above the ground level, and the Doric columns supporting it had diameters of . At the western end of the arcade, a statue of Alexander Johnston Cassatt stood in a niche on the northern wall where stairs descended to a waiting room where passengers could wait for their trains. There was also a statue of PRR president Samuel Rea directly across from Cassatt's statue, on the southern wall, which was installed in 1930. = Interior = Street level floorplanThe expansive waiting room, which spanned Penn Station's entire length from 31st to 33rd Streets, contained traveler amenities such as long benches, men's and women's smoking lounges, newspaper stands, telephone and telegraph booths, and baggage windows. The main waiting room, inspired by the Baths of Diocleziano and other Roman structures, approximated the scale of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, expressed in a steel framework clad in plaster that imitated the lower wall portions of travertine. The room measured long, wide, and tall. There were three semicircular windows on top of each of the waiting room's walls; each had a radius of . With these dimensions Penn Station was the largest indoor space in New York City and one of the largest public spaces in the world. The Baltimore Sun said in April 2007 that the station was \\"as grand a corporate statement in stone, glass and sculpture as one could imagine.\\" Historian Jill Jonnes called the original edifice a \\"great Doric temple to transportation\\". The large clock under the glass dome in the exit concourse Penn Station was one of the first rail terminals to separate arriving from departing passengers on two concourses. Directly adjoining the waiting room was an exit-only concourse area for arriving passengers. The floor area of the exit concourse was larger: it was long by wide. This exit concourse was covered by a series of glass domes that were held up by a plain steel framework. LIRR trains had exclusive use of the station's northernmost four tracks, while the PRR was exclusively assigned the southernmost tracks; the two railroads shared the center tracks as necessary. LIRR commuters could also use an entrance on the northern side, along 33rd Street. There was an additional mezzanine level below the main concourse and waiting room; it contained two smaller concourses, one for each railroad. The smaller northern mezzanine, used by the LIRR, connected to the LIRR platforms via short stairs and to the 33rd Street entrance via escalators. The smaller southern mezzanine, used by the PRR, contained stairs and elevators between the PRR platforms and the level of the main exit concourse and waiting room. At platform level, there were 21 tracks serving 11 platforms, and the station could accommodate up to 144 trains per hour. An estimated of storage tracks in and around the station could store up to 386 train carriages. The station contained 25 elevators for baggage and passenger use. The storage yards were located between Ninth and Tenth Avenues in a cut that was later covered and built over. The structure above it was supported by 650 steel columns, each supporting a weight of up to . East of the station, tracks 5‚Äì21 merged into two three-track tunnels, which then merged into the East River Tunnels' four tracks. West of the station, at approximately Ninth Avenue, all 21 tracks merged into the North River Tunnels' two tracks. Tracks 1‚Äì4, the station's southernmost tracks, terminated at bumper blocks at the east end of the station, so they could only be used by trains from New Jersey. Four switch towers, lettered from A to D, controlled train movements around the station. The main switch tower was Tower A, located between Eighth and Ninth Avenues; it still exists, although it is now located below the Farley Post Office. = Art = The artist Jules Gu√©rin was commissioned to create six murals for Penn Station; each of his works were over tall. The station contained four pairs of sculptures designed by Adolph Weinman, titled Day and Night. These sculpture pairs, whose figures were based on model Audrey Munson, flanked large clocks on the top of each side of the building. The Day and Night sculptures were accompanied by small stone eagles. There were also 22 larger, freestanding stone eagles placed on Penn Station's exterior.  Surviving elements  Following the demolition of the original Penn Station, many of its architectural elements were lost or buried in the New Jersey Meadowlands. Some elements were salvaged and relocated. Additional architectural elements remain in the present-day station: some were covered over, while others remain visible throughout the current station. = Ornaments and art = Of the 22 eagle sculptures around the station exterior, the locations of all 14 larger, freestanding eagles are known. Three remain in New York City: two at the Penn Plaza and Madison Square Garden complex along Seventh Avenue, and one at the Cooper Union, Adolph Weinman's alma mater. Cooper's eagle had been located in the courtyard of the Albert Nerken School of Engineering at 51 Astor Place, but was relocated in the summer of 2009, along with the engineering school, to a new academic building at 41 Cooper Square. This eagle is no longer visible from the street, as it is located on the building's roof. Three are on Long Island: two at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, and one at the LIRR station in Hicksville, New York. Four reside on the Market Street Bridge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, across from that city's 30th Street Station. There are also individual eagles at four locations. One is positioned near the end zone at the football field of Hampden-Sydney College near Farmville, Virginia. Another is located on the grounds of the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The other individual eagles are located in Vinalhaven, Maine, as well as at the Valley Forge Military Academy in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania. Of the eight smaller eagles, which surrounded the four Day and Night sculptures, four are accounted for. Two are located at the entrance to Skylands in Ringwood, New Jersey. The family of Albert Fritsch, a PRR mechanic, owns a fragment of another eagle. Three pairs of the Day and Night sculptures have been located. One of the four Day and Night sculptures still survives as the Eagle Scout Memorial Fountain in Kansas City, Missouri. Another pair of Day and Night sculptures was found in 1998 at the Con-Agg Recycling Corporation plant in the Bronx; the two damaged sculptures had been stored at the recycling plant since at least the mid-1990s. The Night sculpture was moved to the sculpture garden at the Brooklyn Museum. The two other pairs of Day and Night sculptures were discarded in the Meadowlands. One of these sculptures, recovered by Robert A. Roe, was stored at Ringwood State Park in Passaic County, New Jersey. In the late 1990s, NJ Transit wanted to install the sculptures at Newark Broad Street station. However, this did not happen, and a writer for the website Untapped Cities found the sculpture pair in a Newark parking lot in mid-2017. The Brooklyn Museum also owns part of one of the station's Ionic columns as well as some plaques from the station. The largest piece of the station that is known to had been salvaged, a Doric column, was transported upstate to Woodridge, New York, circa 1963. The Doric column had been intended for an unbuilt college in Woodridge, the Verrazano College. However, the column remained in Woodridge once plans for the college were canceled, since it was very unwieldy to bring the column back downstate. In addition, eighteen of the station's 84 columns were supposed to be placed in Battery Park in Lower Manhattan. However, the columns were dumped in a landfill in New Jersey instead. The statue of Samuel Rea still exists and is located outside the modern Penn Station entrance on Seventh Avenue. = Layout features = Other small architectural details remain in the station. Some of the original staircases to platform level, with brass and iron handrails, still exist, though others have been replaced with escalators. An original cast iron partition was uncovered during renovations, now separating a Long Island Rail Road waiting area from the hallway on the lower concourse. Original granite becomes exposed every so often in heavily trafficked corridors where modern flooring has worn, and the modern waiting areas and ticket booths occupy roughly the same spaces as the original 1910 configuration. Vestiges of the northern entrance carriageway also exist. The modern station still maintains the structural underpinnings of the original station. From platform level, glass vault lights can still be seen embedded within the ceiling (the floor of the lower concourse) that once let light pass through the concourse from the glass ceilings of the original train shed. = Penn Station Services Building = The Penn Station Services Building, located just south of the station at 242 West 31st Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues, was constructed in 1908 to provide electricity and heat for the station. The building measures long by tall, with a pink-granite facade in the Roman Doric style, and was designed by McKim, Mead and White. A wall runs from north to south, bisecting the building, with power-generating boilers west of the wall and power distributing equipment and offices to the east. The structure survived the demolition of the main station building, but was downgraded so that it only provided compressed air for the switches in the interlockings under the station. In January 2020, a southward expansion of Pennsylvania Station, to be called Penn South, was proposed. The proposal would expand the track area south to West 30th Street and require demolition of the entire block upon which the building is located.  In media  Several scenes in the 1945 film The Clock take place in Pennsylvania Station but were actually shot on MGM Stage 27 due to wartime cost constraints. \\"Strangers on a Train\\"the Raymond Chandler murder mystery brought to the screen by Alfred Hitchcock, has a chase scene in Pennsylvania Station showing its magnificent central terminal.September 27, 2020. Pennsylvania Station was recreated for a scene in the film Motherless Brooklyn. Visual effects were combined with an actual set and actors in period costume, although the version shown reflects its more pristine image in the 1920s and 1930s rather than its more dilapited condition by the film's 1957 setting.

Biography  Snow on Ayase river (1915), now in the collection of the Rijksmuseum Hiroaki Takahashi was born in Tokyo, Japan, in 1871. As a young artist he was given the artistic name Shotei by his uncle, Matsumoto Fuko, under whose tutelage he was apprenticing. When he was 16 years old, he started a job with the Imperial Household Department of Foreign Affairs, where he copied the designs of foreign ceremonial objects. As with many Japanese woodblock artists over his lifetime he signed his work with various names and worked for several publishing companies. After studying art, Shotei and Terazaki Kogyo founded the Japan Youth Painting Society in 1889. In 1907, as a successful artist, he was recruited by Sh≈çzabur≈ç Watanabe to contribute to the Shin Hanga (\\"New Prints\\") art movement in Japan. Watanabe helped to fulfill the Western demand for Ukiyoe woodblock prints which would be similar to familiar historical masters of that genre, including Hiroshige. In about 1921 Shotei added the artistic name of Hiroaki. In 1923 the Great Kanto earthquake (and subsequent fire) destroyed Watanabe's facilities; this included all Shin Hanga woodblocks. Thus, Shotei recreated prior designs destroyed in the Great Kanto earthquake and also continued to produce new woodblocks. Shotei died of pneumonia on February 11, 1945. There is a persistent rumor that he died in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, but this is incorrect. Since Watanabe produced artwork for Western collectors there are numerous copies of Shotei woodblocks in Western museums including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, Massachusetts.

Background His father, Joseph Curry (1855-1919), is often mistakenly referred to as \\"Sr.\\" to avoid confusion with the son, whose middle name is derived not from the father but from the maiden name of his mother, the former Dorcea \\"Dot\\" Tullis. The senior Curry, a merchant and planter, had been part of the posse in 1878 which apprehended some one thousand African Americans in a revolt near Waterproof against then parish judge and later State Senator Charles C. Cordill. The senior Curry was first a deputy sheriff and then was elected Tensas Parish clerk of court, a position which he retained for many years. Dot Curry's brothers were Robert Lee Tullis (c. 1865-1955), a former secretary to a mayor of New Orleans and thereafter a longtime professor and dean of the Louisiana State University Law Center in Baton Rouge, and Hugh Tullis (1857-1931), an attorney and district judge in the delta country. Curry's cousin, Garner Hugh Tullis, served for three terms as the president of the New Orleans Cotton Exchange. Curry attended Culver Military Academy in Culver, Indiana, and the University of Virginia at Charlottesville, Virginia. He was a United States Army officer during World War I. Like most of the Tensas Parish planters, Curry was a member of the Episcopal Church. He was also affiliated with the Masonic lodge. Career After military service, Curry became the secretary-treasurer of the Panola Company, a large agricultural operation in St. Joseph. He was a member of the Chamber of Commerce and a director of the Bank of St. Joseph. He was part of a contingent from Tensas Parish who successfully lobbied in Washington, D.C., to block construction of the proposed Eudora Floodway, named for Eudora, Arkansas, the origin of Bayou Macon. The flood would have run near the boundary of East Carroll and West Carroll parishes and potentially placed vast Louisiana acreage to the south and east in danger in the event of severe flooding like that which had occurred in 1927. Curry won a special election for the House after Daniel F. Ashford, another St. Joseph planter, died in office in 1929. Curry was chairman for part of his tenure of the Public Works, Lands, and Levee Committee, a panel of particular importance to the parishes along the Mississippi River. Originally anti-Long, like most of the planter class, Curry by his second full term had begun to vote increasingly with the Long faction that he had first opposed. Sheriff Elliot D. Coleman, who served from 1936 to 1960, was also staunchly pro-Long; indeed he had been a bodyguard at the assassination in Baton Rouge in 1935 of Huey Pierce Long, Jr., and claimed to have fired two shots at proclaimed assassin Carl Weiss. The 1935-1936 state elections, with memory of Huey Long's demise fresh in the minds of voters, proved devastating to many anti-Longites. The yeoman and tenant farmers gained the voter majority over the planters and business class. Where planters remained in office they did so through their political flexibility. The particular blot to the planter came with the unseating in 1936 of U.S. Representative Riley J. Wilson, one of Huey Long's unsuccessful gubernatorial primary opponents in 1928. Curry was married to the former Rita Camors (1901-1944). He was a widower for the last seventeen years of his life. He died some five weeks after the passing of their daughter, Josephine Curry Evans (1935-1961). The Currys, including his parents, are interred at Natchez City Cemetery in Natchez, Mississippi.

In pre-colonial times, land belonged to the African communities that occupied it, and their members were free to use it in accordance with local customary law. In the late 19th century, large areas of fertile land were acquired by European settlers, and the remainder became Crown land, which the colonial government could alienate without the consent of the resident communities. To give a measure of protection to those communities, in 1916 land in Native Reserves, which then amounted to about a quarter of the land in the protectorate, was designated as Native Trust Land, to be held in trust for the benefit of African communities. Later, in 1936, all Crown Land except game or forest reserves or that used for public purposes became Native Trust Land, and Native Authorities were authorised to allocate Trust Land to their communities in accordance with customary law. After 1936, Native Trust Land constituted over 80% of the land in Nyasaland and most African farmers farmed Native Trust Land (renamed African Trust Land in 1950) from then until Nyasaland gained independence as Malawi in 1964 and after. Pre-colonial land ownership In much of Malawi, the right of land ownership in pre-colonial times belonged under customary law to the African communities that occupied it. Community leaders could allocate the use of communal land to be used by its members, but in general they did so in accordance with custom, which generally prevented it being granted to outsiders. Neither the leaders nor the current members of a community could alienate its land, which they held in trust for future generations. In 1902, the Parliament of the United Kingdom enacted the British Central Africa Order, which provided that English Law (including land law) would apply generally in the British Central Africa Protectorate, and that the Crown had sovereignty over all the land in the protectorate, which was held by others as its tenants. Customary law had little or no legal status in the early colonial period and little recognition or protection was given to customary land or the communities that used it. After 1860, the area that is now southern Malawi suffered insecurity through warfare and slave raiding: this led to the widespread abandonment fertile land. Local chiefs tried to gain protection from European companies and settlers who had entered the area from the 1860s by granting them the right to cultivate this abandoned, insecure land. The African Lakes Company, formed in 1877 to cooperate with the missions established in central Africa by combating the slave trade and introducing legitimate trade, claimed to have made treaties or agreements with several chiefs. Some of these treaties claimed to have transferred sovereignty to the company, which may have had the ambition to become a Chartered company. Three others individuals also claimed to have purchased large areas of land. Eugene Sharrer claimed to have acquired 363,034 acres, and he had attempted to induce chiefs to give up their sovereign rights: he also possibly intended to form his own Chartered company. Alexander Low Bruce, the son-in-law of David Livingstone and a director of the African Lakes Company, claimed 176,000 acres, and John Buchanan and his brothers claimed a further 167,823 acres. These lands were purchased for trivial quantities of goods under agreements signed by chiefs with no understanding of English concepts of land tenure. The Colonial Land Settlement The British government appointed Harry Johnston, later Sir Harry, as commissioner and consul-general of the British Central Africa Protectorate from 1891. Johnston rejected the suggestion that any agreements made before the protectorate was established could transfer sovereignty to individuals or companies. However, he did accept that these agreements might be evidence of land sales. The prevailing legal theory in the 1880s was that the Crown's authority in any British protectorate was limited to the management of its external relations and the affairs of British subjects. Protected Africans retained their internal sovereignty, and were only subject to Crown control if, and to the extent, agreed on in treaties and concessions. The mere proclamation of a protectorate did not give the Crown property in its land or minerals, unless the agreements with African rulers so provided. Before the British Central Africa Protectorate was proclaimed in June 1891, Johnston had only made treaties of friendship with local chiefs; these did not surrender sovereignty to the Crown, and he did not consider that the Crown had a general claim to sovereign ownership of any land unless this had been expressly transferred by cession. Without sovereignty, the Crown had no right to alienate that land. The treaties that he made from July 1891 did cede sovereignty over land in the areas concerned, but they granted the chiefs and people involved the right to retain the land that they actually occupied, leaving all the unoccupied land free for the Crown to dispose of. The treaties that included the cessation of land rights covered less than half of the Protectorate. Although the protectorate had been proclaimed on the understanding that British South Africa Company would contribute to the costs of its administration, Johnson, resisted the company's demand that Crown lands where sovereignty had been ceded, which formed over 20% of the land of the protectorate, should be transferred to its control and that Johnson should also facilitate the transfer of lands remaining in African hands, amounting to over 40% of total land, to it (the remaining 15% was already in European ownership). This would have created a situation on the South African model, with African confined to limited reserves. Although Johnston accepted that the land belonged to its African communities, so their chiefs had no right to alienate it to anyone, he put forward the legal fiction that each chief's people had tacitly accepted he could assume such a right. Under this interpretation chiefs could cede land to the Crown or sell or grant land not currently being used by the community to Europeans. Johnston also claimed that the Crown had two rights as the Protecting Power. Firstly, that any \\"waste\\" land (if not currently in use or occupied) was Crown Land and freehold or leasehold titles over it could be granted to Europeans. This, however disregarded African practices of cultivation, in which only a part of a family's land would be cultivated at any time, with the greater part left fallow to be used in the future. Secondly, that the Crown was entitled to investigate whether any earlier sales or transfers were valid and, if they were, to issue a Certificate of Claim (in effect a registration of freehold title) in the land to the new owners. The land comprised in the Certificates of Claim amounted to some 1.4 million Hectares, including a claim in North Nyasa district of just over 1 million Hectares; the rest was mainly in the Shire Highlands. Johnston had no legal training and the protectorate had no law officers until 1896. However, when the legality of the Certificates of Claim system was challenged in 1903 on the basis that the agreements made by the chiefs breached the rights of their community members, the Appeals Court upheld the validity of the certificates, ruling that that title arose from a grant by the Crown's representative, not from any agreements made by the chiefs. The court did however judge that many aspects of the agreements were unfair and one-sided. Johnston recorded that his review of land claims begun in late 1892 was necessary because the proclamation of the protectorate had been followed by a wholesale land grab, with huge areas of land bought for trivial sums and many claims overlapping or requiring adjustment. He regarded long occupation and improvement of the land as the best way to justify a claim, but it only rarely happened. Failing this, he or an assistant sought confirmation that the chiefs named in agreements had agreed to sell the land and had received a fair return for the sale. However, his estimates of land value were very low, from a halfpenny an acre for indifferent land up to a maximum of threepence an acre in the most favoured districts. The existing African villages and farms were exempted from these sales, and the villagers were told that their homes and fields were not being alienated. In addition, most Certificates of Claim included a non-disturbance clause providing that existing African villages and planted areas were not to be disturbed without consent from the protectorate government. African Land Rights The non- disturbance clauses were largely ineffective, firstly because the landowners routinely ignored them with impunity, secondly because the land occupied by Africans at the date of the certificate was not recorded and thirdly, the practice of shifting cultivation meant that much of what Johnston thought was unoccupied or waste land near villages was temporarily out of use and resting under local variants of the Chitemene system that is still employed in parts of Zambia. No protection was offered to Africans living outside the area of Certificates of Claim, but subsistence cultivators on Crown land were allowed to continue on their holdings unless and until the land was sold or leased to settlers. As all Crown lands were potentially available for settler expansion, villagers living on as yet unalienated land felt insecure. In the early years of the protectorate, owners usually did not object to Africans resident on their estates practising shifting cultivation and moving their fields every few years, as they wanted to retain existing residents and attract new ones as a workforce. However, any new residents were obliged to provide unpaid labour in lieu of rent for the land they occupied under the system of thangata. Although original residents were, at least in theory, exempt from this form of labour rent, once cotton started to be grown commercially after 1901, followed by widespread planting of tobacco from 1905, this exemption came under attack. Both crops needed a great deal of labour during their growing seasons, and owners attempted to reduce all residents to the status of insecure labour tenants, who could be evicted at will. This situation was not finally resolved until the colonial administration's Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928 removed the distinction between descendants of original residents and others by abolishing non-disturbance clauses. After 1900, the view which gained prominence among Foreign Office lawyers was that the former theory of protectorate only applied to those declared over more civilised communities and that the mere declaration of a protectorate over what in one case were termed \\"semi-barbarous natives\\" gave Crown officers in that protectorate the right to dispose of land there. An Order-in-Council for government of the British Central Africa Protectorate issued in 1902 declared that all rights related to Crown lands were vested in the commissioner, and it empowered him to dispose of any such land. Crown lands were defined as all public lands in the Protectorate under the control of the Crown through any treaty or agreement. The effect of the British Central Africa Order, 1902 was that all land not in private European ownership became Crown land which the colonial government could alienate: this covered about 85% of the protectorate's land area. Alfred Sharpe, who was commissioner then governor from 1896 to 1910, favoured a policy of creating reserves limited to those areas required for African subsistence, and allowing any land not required for subsistence to be alienated for commercial farming. In 1904, he received powers to reserve areas of Crown Land for the African people under the Native Locations Ordinance, 1904. His successor as governor from 1911 to 1913, William Manning, who had previously served in the protectorate from 1893 to 1902, was more sympathetic to African farmers, and opposed moving them into minimal reserves to clear land for European settlers. By 1913, the Native Reserves covered 6.6 million acres out the 22.3 million acres of land in the protectorate, and a further 2.6 million acres of Crown Land were planned to become future reserves. These areas and the private estates encompassed nearly all the land which seemed capable of cultivation. The population was growing and concerns about future land availability started a debate about the respective needs of European and African communities for land. The Creation of Native Trust Land The Land Registration Ordinance, 1916 recognised the Native Reserves as Native Trust Land, to be held in trust for the benefit of African communities. The 1916 Ordinance did not provide for the administration of Trust Land by African communities or their leaders, as formal indirect rule was only introduced in 1933-34, although, in practice, chiefs had day-to-day charge of land distribution. It was not until the Nyasaland Protectorate (Native Trust Lands) Order, 1936 that any conversion of Trust Land to freehold was prohibited. The 1936 Order declared that all Crown Land except game or forest reserves or that used for public purposes would become Native Trust Land, and authorised Native Authorities to allocate Trust Land to their communities in accordance with customary law. This reflected the Colonial Office rejection to the Report of the 1920 Land Commission (which was not approved as it interfered with native land rights). The Land Commission was one of a number of bodies that tried to bring order to the confusion over land rights in Nyasaland. Its report opposed formal reserves, but recommended a calculation of what land should be provided for present and future African subsistence agriculture and making much of the rest available for European settlement. It also wanted curbs on Africans cultivating economic crops, which was also aimed at promoting European agriculture. The report of an East Africa Lands Commission in 1924-5 favoured a reserve system similar to that of Kenya, with a Native Lands Trust Board to oversee the reserves. An Ordinance for this purpose was enacted in 1927, and certain areas were designated as \\"Crown lands for the settlement of Natives\\", but this did little to change existing arrangements and, as some commercial development by settlers was considered useful, there was provision for some land alienation, in the form of 99-year leases. After a review of pre-1891 land claims following the Report of the Natives Reserve Commission, 1929, the Colonial Office believed that the Crown had a very uncertain title to land comprised in any treaty where sovereignty had not been ceded expressly. It did not propose to return any land to African ownership but wished to hold it and other former Crown land in Trust for Africans. The 1936 Native Trust Land Order classified land as Crown, Reserved, and Native Trust lands. Crown Land was defined as including all lands and interests in land acquired or occupied by or on behalf of the Crown. Reserved lands covered land occupied under Certificates of Claim (previously classified as private land) and any land subsequently granted or leased out of Crown lands. Reserved lands also included forest reserves and land in township areas. All other land became Native Trust Land. This was vested in the Secretary of State for the Colonies, but administered by the governor for the use and common benefit of the natives. The 1936 Order recognised that Africans could occupy and use Native Trust Land as a matter of right, but no other racial group in the protectorate was similarly entitled. The Governor could, however, grant a right of occupancy of Native Trust land to a member of any racial group, normally as a lessee. Subsequently, the 1950 Order-in-Council restyled Native Trust Land as African Trust Land (as the word \\"native\\" had pejorative connotations), Crown Land as Public Land, and Reserved lands as Private Land. This structure remained in place until independence in 1964. African Trust Land was now vested in the governor for the use and common benefit of the Africans. The authorities controlling land use and occupation were African chiefs and headmen, and African customs and laws were recognised as the governing law. The aims of the 1936 Native Trust Land Order included reassuring the African people of Nyasaland of their rights in the land they occupied, and relieving them of fears of its alienation without their consent. These aims were incompatible with the view that the African people of Nyasaland had only a limited entitlement to as much land as was deemed sufficient for them: the view of the 1920 Land Commission. From 1936, Native Treasuries created under the Native Authorities Courts Treasuries Ordinance were to receive 25% of all leasehold rents collected for Native Trust Land from leases in their Native Authority area. The remaining 75% of rents went to a central fund that topped- up the Treasuries of districts in deficit. In the late colonial period, a major part of post-war colonial policy was the creation of a class of independent smallholders with a secure but negotiable title to their land. This was the aim of the Master Farmer Scheme, which had limited success, producing only 282 Master Farmers after four years. Most Africans continued to farm Native Trust Land.

The book's title refers to the 1919 massacre at Jallianwala Bagh in which 379 people were shot by troops under the command of Dyer. It is the second biography written on Dyer, the first having been written in the 1930s with co-operation from Dyer's widow. Collett had read Dyer's book Raiders of the Sarhad while he was serving in the army. He returned to it when writing his dissertation for his Master of Arts in biography at the University of Buckingham. He spent three years researching and writing the book and completed the manuscript in 2003.  Synopsis  The book begins with covering Dyer's parents' lives in British India and their brewery company and then moves on to Dyer's early life, from his time as a day boy at Bishop Cotton school in India. The book then covers Dyer's life while he attended Midleton college in County Cork Ireland and his time at Sandhurst, and then moves on to cover Dyer's life following his graduation from Sandhurst to his postings to the Queen's Royal Regiment (West Surrey) in Cork to their deployment to Belfast during the 1886 Belfast riots and then his service during the Third Burmese War. It then covers Dyer's return to India and being reunited with his family in Shimla and Dyer's studies in the learning Urdu, which was an exam he needed to pass to further his career and his postings to the 39th Garhwal Rifles and the 29th Punjabis to his return to England and the birth of his second child. The book then covers Dyer's time in the 29th, to the Chitral Expedition, a campaign which Dyer had tried to join but which had ended six days before he arrived back from England, it then covers Dyer's return to England as he had been granted a place at Camberley Staff College as he had passed the entrance exams, moving on to cover Dyer's passing the final examinations from Camberley and the birth of his second son. It then goes into detail on the Dyer's family return to India and Dyer being given the designation of wing officer. The book moves on to cover the Amritsar massacre and subsequent investigation. It covers the reception to the news of the massacre in England to Dyer being pensioned out of the army and the campaign by the Morning Post newspaper which raised ¬£26,000 ($42,386.5) from public donations.  Reception  Antony Copley writing in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society said the book would be an award winning biography. David McKirdy reviewing the book for the Asian Review of Books said that Collett was ideally placed to write this biography, as like Dyer Collett served in the British army, had attended Sandhurst and had also commanded a Gurkha regiment. McKirdy also says the book is a well referenced addition to other books which cover this time in history. Chandar S. Sundaram writing for Itinerario has said that this was the \\"definitive work\\" on the massacre and that Collett had detailed the life of Dyer with exceptional skill. Nicholas Fearn writing for The Independent said the book was a \\"thorough reconstruction\\" of the massacre and that the book was \\"heavily detailed treatment and serious to the point of dryness.\\" He also said that because of the material Dyer could be compared to General Melchett from the comedy show Blackadder Goes Forth. Mihir Bose writing for History Today said \\"Collett has told this terrible story with great, forensic skill, marshalling his facts brilliantly.\\" Gordon Johnson praised it as an outstanding contribution to our understanding of this horrific event that presented a balanced reading of Dyer's character.

Description St. Columba's Catholic Boy's School was opened by the then Conservative Prime Minister Edward Heath on 7 May 1973. The lower and upper sections of the school were amalgamated on the present site in June 1990 in an extended building. A ¬£5 million new build project on the site which included a new teaching block, new sports hall, and refurbished theatre was opened in 2005. The school converted to academy status in September 2012, and it was previously under the direct control of Bexley London Borough Council. The school continues to coordinate with Bexley London Borough Council for admissions. St. Columba's Catholic Boys' School are close partners with their sister school, St. Catherine's Catholic School for Girls, which is located on a separate site nearby. The uniform for St. Columba's is black with a blue lapel for years 7-10, for Year 11 it is a yellow/gold lapel. The school tie is blue, black and yellow. In Year 11 pupils who have an outstanding attitude to learning will earn a gold tie. Recently, a new silver tie for Year 10 pupils has been introduced for an outstanding attitude to learning. Following a short inspection of the school on 23 January 2019 James Whiting, the Ofsted Inspector, ranked the school 'good'. This was the first short inspection carried out since the school was also judged to be good by Ofsted in their previous inspection that was carried out in September 2014. The report went on to say that the leadership team has maintained the good quality of education in the school since the last inspection. The report also said that the Catholic values held by the school are evident in the safe and welcoming community the school has become.

As a three-year-old he became the only French-trained horse to win both of Britain's most important all-aged mile races, the Sussex Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. Unraced as a two- year-old, Bigstone raced fourteen times, winning five times in a racing career which lasted from March 1993 until November 1994. After his successes in England in 1993 he added two more Group One races in France as a four-year- old, winning the Prix d'Ispahan and the Prix de la For√™t. He was then retired to stud where he had mixed success as a sire of winners. Background Bigstone was a bay horse with a white star bred in Ireland by Dayton Ltd, a breeding operation owned by Daniel Wildenstein. He was sired by Last Tycoon, an Irish-bred, French-trained horse who won the King's Stand Stakes, Nunthorpe Stakes and Breeders' Cup Mile in 1986. At stud, he also sired Ezzoud, Marju and Lady Of Chad (Prix Marcel Boussac). His dam Batave, was a good sprinter who finished second to Last Tycoon in the Prix de Saint-Georges, and was a granddaughter of the 1000 Guineas and Oaks Stakes winner Sweet Solera. Racing career =1993: three-year-old season= Bigstone, who had raced twice at two, finishing second on each occasion, made a winning reappearance at three in the Listed Prix Omnium over 1600 metres at Saint-Cloud on 30 March. A month later he was moved up in class and distance for the Group Two Prix Greffulhe over 2100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. Ridden by Dominique Boeuf, he finished second to the Andr√© Fabre-trained Hunting Hawk. He was then moved up to Group One class and sustained two narrow defeats: he was beaten a neck by Le Balafre when favourite for the Prix Jean Prat and finished second by a nose by Fort Wood in the Grand Prix de Paris. On 28 July, Bigstone was sent to England to contest the Sussex Stakes over one mile at Goodwood Racecourse and started a 14/1 outsider in a field which included Culture Vulture, Sayyedati and the favourite Zafonic. Boeuf settled the colt in the middle of the field before taking the lead a furlong from the finish and winning by one and a half lengths from Sayyedati. Boeuf's celebrations after his first win in Britain were described as being \\"so frenzied he almost fell from the saddle\\". Lellouche admitted that he had not been confident of beating Zafonic but said that \\"we will not be afraid in future\\". In September at Deauville Racecourse, Bigstone started favourite for the Prix Jacques Le Marois but was beaten in a three-way photo-finish by Kingmambo and Ski Paradise, with the British-trained colt Barathea in fourth place. Bigstone returned to England for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 25 September when his opponents included Kingmambo, Barathea and Sayyedati. Ridden for the first time by the Irish jockey Pat Eddery, he started at odds of 100/30 on \\"good to soft\\" ground. Eddery restrained the colt towards the rear of the nine runner field before making headway in the straight. He took the lead a furlong from the finish and won by one and a half lengths from Barathea with Kingmambo two and a half lengths back in third. On his final appearance of the season, Bigstone was sent to the United States to contest the Breeders' Cup Mile on firm ground at Santa Anita Park. Ridden again by Eddery he finished sixth of the thirteen runners behind Lure. =1994: four- year-old season= Bigstone began his four-year-old season in the Group One Prix d'Ispahan over 1850 metres at Longchamp in May. Ridden by Olivier Peslier, he won by a neck from the British-trained five-year-old Muhtarram with the favourite Hatoof in fourth place. He then sustained three consecutive defeats, finishing eighth behind Distant View in the Sussex Stakes, fourth behind Ski Paradise in the Prix du Moulin and third to the 66/1 outsider Maroof in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. In October, Bigstone moved down in distance for the 1400 metre Prix de la For√™t at Longchamp. Ridden by Peslier, he raced in fourth place before taking the lead inside the last 200 metres and won by a short neck from the British-trained four-year-old Missed Flight despite swerving to the right in the final strides. The unplaced horses included Ski Paradise, Las Meninas, Lemon Souffle and the Haydock Sprint Cup winner Lavinia Fontana. Bigstone ended his career with a second attempt at the Breeders' Cup Mile, but again failed to show his best form, finishing eighth of the fourteen runners behind Barathea. Stud record Bigstone stood as a breeding stallion at the Coolmore Stud in Ireland before being sold to Y P Chen and exported to China in 1999.

Two workers were killed and 114 injured. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (CSB) launched investigations to determine how and why the heat exchanger failed. The Chemical Safety Board concluded that a standby heat exchanger had filled with hydrocarbon. This heat exchanger was isolated from its pressure relief; shortly after the heat exchanger was heated with hot water, the hydrocarbon flashed to vapor, ruptured the heat exchanger, and exploded. The effects of the explosion were felt several miles away. Senator Troy Brown [D-Napoleonville], who was at his home five miles from the plant when the blast occurred, said, \\"For about a good two to three seconds, it felt like an earthquake.\\" A shelter-in-place order was issued to residences and businesses within a two-mile (3.2 km) radius of the plant. Background The Williams Olefins Plant was established in 1968 by Allied Chemical and transferred to Williams Olefins following a merger with Union Texas Petroleum in September 1999. The plant produces ethylene, propylene and other products through steam cracking of ethane and propane. This process uses high temperatures to break long-chain hydrocarbons into shorter-chain olefins. The ethane is diluted with steam and briefly heated in a furnace without the presence of oxygen. Typical reaction temperatures are very high, at around , but the reaction is only allowed to take place very briefly. After the cracking temperature has been reached, the gas is quickly quenched in the heat exchanger to stop the reaction. The plant produces 40,000 tons (36,000 tonnes) of propylene and 650,000 tons (590,000 tonnes) of ethylene every year for use in the plastics industry. The explosion was the first major incident in the plant's history, although there had been numerous leaks of flammable gases in recent years. On December 18, 2012 workers discovered \\"a visible leak\\" of propylene gas. According to a report submitted by Williams Olefins to the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), of propylene gas escaped. Williams Olefins said, \\"Piping corrosion under insulation is believed to be a significant factor in this incident [...] This was a small isolated corrosion location that had not been previously found.\\" The Times-Picayune of New Orleans reported that there had been leaks of each of ethylene and volatile organic compounds in 2010, of benzene in 2009, and of propylene in 2008. Event The event was investigated by the Chemical Safety Board, and their report pieced together the event. At the Williams Geismar Olefin Plant, propylene was extracted from a stream of hydrocarbon by heating the mixture in one of two reboilers, followed by fractional distillation. The reboilers were of a shell and tube design, with the hydrocarbon stream in the shell side, and hot water in the tubes. While the reboilers were originally designed to be used concurrently, a modification was performed in 2001 to allow each reboiler to be used independently from the other, allowing a fouled reboiler to be cleaned without shutting the unit down. Valves were installed to isolate each reboiler from the other, and they had the effect of preventing the isolated reboiler from accessing the pressure relief valve at the top of the propylene distillation column. Reboiler B, that ultimately failed, had been purged with nitrogen and isolated from process with a single closed block valve after maintenance activity in February 2012. Some amount of liquid propane was determined to have entered Reboiler B despite this closed block valve. On June 13, 2013, Reboiler A that was in operation was believed to be fouled, and the operations supervisor intended to start the process (engaging operations and maintenance personnel) to switch to Reboiler B. According to process logs, hot water started flowing into Reboiler B at 8:33 am, and the reboiler exploded 3 minutes later after the hydrocarbon process fluid flashed to vapor, ruptured the shell of the heat exchanger, and ignited. The explosion killed an operator at the scene, and the operations supervisor died from burns the next day. 167 other people on-site were injured as well. 30,000 lb. of hydrocarbons was released, and the fire lasted for 3.5 hours. Schematic of the propylene fractionator system that shows how Reboilers A & B are not separately vented to the pressure relief valve. This schematic was originally published in the CSB report. Investigations =Internal investigation= On October 3, 2013 Williams Olefins announced the results of their internal investigation. The company said that a rupture in the heat exchanger caused a vapor cloud \\"which was ignited by an unknown source, causing the explosion.\\" =OSHA investigation= On December 11, 2013 OSHA cited Williams Olefins for six process safety management standard violations, including one willful, and fined the company $99,000. Dorinda Folse, OSHA's Baton Rouge area director, said: \\"Williams Olefins violated safety and health standards which, when followed, can protect workers from hazardous chemicals. It is the employer's responsibility to find and fix workplace safety violations and to ensure the safety of its workers. Failing to do so cost two workers their lives.\\" The five serious violations, where there was \\"substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known\\", were: *inadvertently mixing hot quench water with propylene *failing to provide appropriate pressure protection for a pressure vessel *failing to complete a process hazard analysis to address the opening of hot quench water flow into a pressure vessel *failing to properly document workplace training *failing to promptly correct deficiencies related to process safety management discovered by an internal compliance audit team The willful violation‚Äîdefined as one \\"committed with intentional, knowing or voluntary disregard for the law's requirements, or with plain indifference to worker safety and health\\"‚Äîwas the company's failure to develop clear, written procedures for how to change and put idle pressure vessels into service. =Chemical Safety Board investigation= The Chemical Safety Board issued a detailed report, and some of the key lessons include: * Overpressure protection is critical to protect pressure vessels from rupture. * Valves can leak or be operated inadvertently, as opposed to pipe blinds. * The importance of a robust safety culture, and the use of tools such as process hazard analyses (PHAs), management of change reviews (MOCs), and pre-startup safety reviews (PSSRs) at identifying potential hazards, evaluating their potential effects, effectively addressing them, followed by verification. Lawsuits In the first civil trial regarding the explosion, four workers filed suit against Williams Olefins LLC and parent company Williams Companies, Inc. for their alleged negligence.

On 10 August 2016, Russia successfully tested the RS-28's first-stage engine named PDU-99. The first image of the missile was declassified and unveiled in October 2016. In early 2017, prototype missiles had been reportedly built and delivered to Plesetsk Cosmodrome for trials but the test program was being delayed to re- check key hardware components before initial launch. According to the commander of the Russian Strategic Forces, Col. Gen. Sergei Karakayev, the RS-28 Sarmat will be deployed with the 13th Red Banner Rocket Division of the 31st Missile Army at Dombarovsky Air Base, Orenburg Oblast and with the 62nd Red Banner Rocket Division of the 33rd Guards Rocket Army at Uzhur, Krasnoyarsk Krai, replacing the previous R-36M ICBMs currently located there. In late December 2017, the first successful ejection test of the missile was carried out at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. According to the report, the missile flew several dozen kilometers and fell within the test range. On 1 March 2018, Russian president Vladimir Putin, in his annual address to the Federal Assembly, said that \\"the active phase of tests\\" of the missile had begun.Russia begins tests of promising Sarmat missile complex TASS, 2 March 2018.

On 30 March 2018, the Russian Defence Ministry published a video showing the Sarmat performing its second successful test- launch at the Plesetsk Cosmodrome. On 24 December 2019, during the exhibition of the modern weapon systems at the National Defense Management Center, it was reported that Sarmat is capable of a \\"35,000 km sub-orbital flight\\". The trials of the missile complex are expected to be completed in 2021, and, during the 2020-2027 period, \\"twenty missile regiments are planned to be rearmed with the RS-28\\". Design The RS-28 Sarmat will be capable of carrying about 10 tonnes of payload for either up to 10 heavy or 15 light MIRV warheads, an unspecified number of Avangard hypersonic glide vehicles (HGVs) or a combination of warheads and massive amounts of countermeasures against anti-ballistic missile systems. The Russian ministry of Defense said that the missile is Russia's response to the U.S. Prompt Global Strike system. Sarmat has a short boost phase, which shortens the interval when it can be tracked by satellites with infrared sensors, such as the U.S. Space-Based Infrared System, making it more difficult to intercept. It is speculated that the Sarmat could fly a trajectory over the South Pole, completely immune to any current missile defense system, and that it has the Fractional Orbital Bombardment (FOBS) capability. According to various sources, RS-28's launch sites are to be equipped with the \\"Mozyr\\" active protection system, designed to negate potential adversary's first strike advantage by kinetically destroying incoming bombs, cruise missiles and ICBM warheads at altitudes of up to 6 km.

She was a Malay Dharmasraya princess from Sumatra and the only non- Javanese wife of Kertarajasa, and also the mother of Jayanegara, the second monarch of Majapahit. Tradition mentioned her as a woman of exceptional beauty. The name Dara Pethak in old Malay means \\"white dove\\", while her other name Indreswari in Sanskrit means \\"the consort of Indra\\" and it was acquired after her marriage to Majapahit first king. Early life She was the daughter of King Srimat Tribhuwanaraja Mauliawarmadewa of Dharmasraya Kingdom in Sumatra, and was sent to Java to be presented to Singhasari King. This Sumatran kingdom was held as vassal of Singhasari in 1286. According to Pararaton, ten days after the expulsion of Mongol forces from Java, the Pamalayu expedition led by Mahisa Anabrang returned to Java. The expedition was sent by Singhasari King Kertanegara in 1275 to conquer Sumatra. The returning Javanese troops brought two Malay princesses, Dara Jingga and Dara Petak to be presented for Kertanagara. The two princesses was originally intended for Kertanagara, however because the Singhasari King has died, his heir Raden Wijaya took Dara Petak in hand of marriage instead, while her sister Dara Jingga was betrothed to Adwayabrahma (Mahisa Anabrang), a Singhasari general that led the Sumatran expedition in 1286. As the king's consort Within Majapahit palace, Dara Petak cleverly pleases the king, won his favour and subsequently become the king's favourite consort. She acquired the title Stri tinuheng pura, or the most honored wife in the palace. According to Nagarakretagama, Raden Wijaya already has four wives, Tribhuwaneswari, Prajnaparamita, Narendra Duhita, and Gayatri Rajapatni; all of them are Singhasari princesses, the daughter of Kertanagara. According to Pararaton, Dara Petak was promoted to honorable title because she was the only wife that produced male heir for the king, prince Jayanegara. According to Nagarakretagama, the name of Jayanagara's mother is Indreswari, so it is assumed that this was the new official name of Dara Petak after her marriage to the king. In Kertarajasa inscription (1305), Jayanegara was mentioned as the son of Tribhuwaneswari, the prime queen and first wife of Raden Wijaya. To reconcile these records, historian suggested that Jayanegara is the son of Indreswari or Dara Petak that later being adopted by the childless queen consort Tribhuwaneswari, in order to be promoted as the heir of the throne. Jayanegara become the successor of King Kertarajasa.  References  * Poesponegoro & Notosusanto (ed.). 1990. Sejarah Nasional Indonesia Jilid II. Jakarta: Balai Pustaka. * Slamet Muljana. 2005.

She said, \\"Both of them (Bharat Bala & A. R. Rahman) were very clear that it should be a meaningful song. If the song needed two verses, I wrote eight, and Rahman was able to pick the lines that would work. Neither of them wanted words that we have all already heard.\\" She added that the composer aims positive message to young viewers. The song reflects love, separation, struggle, survival and finally, arising. For both the songs, \\"Innum Konjam Neram\\" and \\"Naetru Aval\\" the composer and the respective song lyricists maintained simple and flowing poetry. On composing for \\"Naetru Aval\\", Rahman stated that he revisited the retro zones to add a ghazal feel to the contemporary music based track. The track \\"Kadal Raasa Naan\\" was initially sung by A. R. Rahman but he felt his voice did not suit the track. He insisted on re-recording it with a singer who could impart more emotions with an earthy voice to the song and eventually opted for Yuvan Shankar Raja. Attributed as a rustic yet character-driven number, the final version was recorded in Chennai on 25 April 2013. In July 2013, when singer Velmurugan sang the same track live at an event, the reports of end January 2013 published by Times of India counter-confirmed that he was the first choice for \\"Kadal Raasa Naan\\". To bring the feel for the song \\"Enga Pona Raasaa\\", the film director wanted singer Shakthisree to visualize herself \\"walking barefoot on the sand\\" and so the picturisation of filmed character \\"Panimalar\\" (played by Parvathi). Rahman patch recorded the song on guitars played by Keba Jeremiah in the range A4 minor. On the first day, the song was recorded in one rhythm. Later, a fundamental part of it was altered. Selectively, portion of words from 'Kaalam enakkul uraiyuthu' until 'Enakenna kedithu' that added continuity to the melancholic track were penned instantaneously after listening to the requisite aalaap sung by Rahman himself. The recorded version though has orchestral violins apart from guitars in its music. For the background score of the film, vocals of several cast members from Africa were recorded. The opening credits theme song was sung by Bruno Conn in Afrikaans. The song \\"Sangamam Anbin Sangamam\\" sung by Chennai based El F√© Choir was headed by Maria Roe Vincent. Actress Parvathy sang an alternate version of the song \\"Enga Pona Raasaa\\". All the three tracks were used only in the film score. Her name featured under the singer's list in the opening credits of film. Reception =Critical reception= The soundtrack received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. The critical review board at Behindwoods gave the album 3.5 out of 5 and stated, \\"Maryan's music serves to prove that when ARR is given a free hand to do as he pleases, he weaves magic! Three instant hits and two slow poisons.\\" Music Aloud noted, \\"Definitely not on par with A R Rahman's previous soundtrack that had similar settings, but at least a couple of songs are here to stay.\\" They gave the soundtrack 8 out of 10. Indiaglitz assigned the album 4.2 out of 5 and stated, \\"Start to finish, the album is purely magical and would make for one of the most cherished repertoires. Coming from none less than the genius, the album sparks further curiosity and interest in the movie. In all, anyone would fall in love with 'Mariyaan'.\\" S. R. Ashok Kumar of The Hindu highlighted that \\"A.R.Rahman once again mesmerises with his compositions.\\" At The Indian Express, Sankhayan Ghosh & Suanshu Khurana pointed, \\"Maryan is bit of a mixed bag, with few songs showing signs of new musical signature and some suffering from over familiarity from the composer's previous own songs.\\" They rated the album 3 out of 5. Srikrishna at Musicperk gave 8 out of 10 to the album and his verdict, \\"While, Kadal had class written all over it, Maryan is much more accessible and eclectic. It also marks Rahman‚Äôs return to pure Tamil folk. A memorable album overall.\\" Critic Srinivas Ramanujam of The Times of India set a score of 4 out of 5 stating, \\"Maryan does have a slight Kadal hangover, in terms of music, but Rahman hits the right note, literally, throughout the album.\\" =Chart performance= The soundtrack album made its debut at number one upon release on the iTunes India charts. The day after release, the track \\"Nenjae Ezhu\\" topped all the charts with over one crore online listeners.

Lake had an instrumental role in the formation of Seminole County. In 1928, Lake was convicted of embezzlement and served 3 years of a 14-year sentence. Early life Lake was born in Newberry, South Carolina on July 15, 1868. After spending some time in Cuba, he moved to Sanford, Florida in 1886. Seven years later, he became mayor of Sanford. He married Mary Maude Anno in Orlando in 1895. Lake influenced the Florida state legislature to pass a bill creating Seminole County by splitting off a portion of Orange County in April 1913, furthering his political career. He served in the Florida House of Representatives as the Orange County representative in 1911 and 1913, and as the Seminole County representative in 1915 and 1923. Sanford Charter Bill In 1911, the community of Sanford Heights seceded from Sanford, because of discord over municipal services provided by Sanford. This added to concerns that Sanford's ability to expand would be constrained by the surrounding towns of Goldsboro, Georgetown and Sanford Heights, as well as Lake Monroe to the north. Lake led legislative efforts to curtail Sanford Heights ability to incorporate, independent of Sanford. Goldsboro was also a target in Lake's annexation process. On April 6, 1911, the Sanford city council passed a resolution to annex Goldsboro and on April 26, 1911 the Florida legislature passed the Sanford Charter Bill, dissolving the incorporation of both Sanford and Goldsboro, and reorganizing Sanford as a city that included Goldsboro within its boundaries. Embezzlement In 1913, Lake sold his icehouse and organized the Seminole County Bank in Sanford's Welbourne building. He was elected president by a board that included some of the new county's most prominent men. His real estate investments faltered during the declining years of the real estate boom period of the 1920s. In 1916, he started construction of the 158-room Hotel Forrest Lake (later named the Mayfair Inn) on the shore of Lake Monroe. The hotel opened in 1925. The posh hotel, built at a cost of one half million dollars resulted in a five million dollar loss for him and his co-investors. Over the next few years, Lake experience similar financial losses. The Seminole Country Bank closed on August 6, 1927, and the following year, Lake and the bank's vice president A. R. Key, were indicted by a grand jury on charges of embezzling $553,000 from the bank. Key plead guilty to two charges, and testified against Lake for the prosecution. After a series of five jury trials, Lake was convicted of five bank fraud charges on May 4, 1928: embezzlement of bank funds, three years; misapplication of bank funds, three years, the two to run concurrently; making a false entry in the bank records, three years; making an overloan to himself, four years; and another misapplication of funds, four years. He was sentenced to a 14 years prison term by Judge Dewitt Gray. He served 16 months of his sentence at Raiford prison before being released on a bond to pursue an appeal. In 1933, he lost the appeal before the state pardon board and was sent back to prison. He would serve six years before he won a pardon from the governor and returned to Sanford. Six months later, he regained his civil rights. Later life Lake returned to Sanford‚Äîa broken man living on the streets of Sanford with others struggling to get through the Depression years‚Äîwhere he lived for the remainder of his life. Following a two-week-long illness, Lake died on January 24, 1939. He was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in Sanford, next to his wife.

Its distance is 54.6 parsecs (178 light years) from the Sun. Mass is within 3 percent of the Sun. Near solar twins can help us to understand solar activity such as solar flares and sunspot cycles over longer time periods than the historical records, and to put unique historical events such as the Maunder minimum in context. They can also be used to set the zero point of fundamental calibrations in astrophysics, and models of solar evolution. Near solar twins can also help answer whether the Sun is unique or not. It used to be thought that the Sun might be unique for its low lithium abundance.

Biography  He was born in the village of Mega Revma near Constantinople in 1869. He was the son of Irene-Erifylli and Alexander Psachos, descended from Cephalonia. A few years later he entered the Central Seminary of Constantinople as a supernumerary. In the Central Seminary, Psachos completed the circular education and was also taught chanting by the responsible teacher and housekeeper of the School, Archimandrite Theodore Matzouranis.Foundation of the Hellenic Word, Konstantinos Psachos, chapter 2. In May 1887, he became a cantor (domestikos) at the Church of the Transfiguration in Galata, serving there until 1891. In 1892, he became archcantor at the Saint Charalampos Greek Hospital of Smyrna. He returned to Constantinople and in 1895 was appointed as archcantor at the Metochion of the Holy Sepulchre, where he was given the opportunity to study many manuscripts in the library of the Metochion. He also served as teacher of Greek language and religion in various schools, such as the Girls' School at the Metochion, to which he was appointed in 1896.Despotopoulou, Fountoulaki (2004), pp. 190-191. In 1898, he helped establish the \\"Ecclesiastical Music Association of Constantinople\\", of which he was special secretary and where he actively served until 1902, when he resigned. He also served as archcantor at the churches of Saint Theodore of Vlanga (1901 to 1903) and Saint Nicholas of Galata (1903 to 1904).Greek Musipedia: Konstantinos Psachos. = Life in Athens = In the early 20th century, Theocletus, the Archbishop of Athens, and George Nazos, director of Athens Conservatory, decided to establish a school of Byzantine music and wrote to the Patriarchate of Constantinople, requesting suggestions for the school's first director. Patriarch Anthimus VII responded to their request by suggesting that Konstantinos Psachos was a suitable person for this post. In 1904, by order of the King George I of Greece, a warship sailing to Constantinople took Psachos to Athens, where he arrived in September 1904. On September 23, 1904 the School began its operation. On September 4, 1905 he married Evanthia Amerikanou from Smyrna. In 1919, he clashed with the Directorate of the Athens Conservatory, and left the school, along with Manolis Kalomiris. In October 1919, he founded the National Conservatory of Music in Athens. Psachos' first wife died in 1922. He married his second wife, Amalia Armao, in December 1932 at Delphi.Foundation of the Hellenic Word, Konstantinos Psachos, chapters 3, 9 and 10.  Musical work  Konstantinos Psachos studied the notation of Byzantine and ancient Greek music. He invented a keyboard musical instrument, the Panarmonio of Eva, dedicated to his friend and pupil, Eva Palmer-Sikelianou, in order to perform Byzantine music in a more authentic manner. He wrote music for ancient tragedies and proposed the harmonization of Byzantine music with the use of two or three resonant lines instead of only one.Papyrus Larousse Britannica, Konstantinos Psachos Psachos wrote Greek music theory. As well as setting sacred chanting to music, he wrote secular music. He set to music the ancient Hymn to Apollo, wrote chorales of ancient tragedies (such as Sophocles' Antigone), composed works for orchestra and choir and published many studies. He also compiled a collection of folk-songs with Byzantine and European musical notation.

On 3 September 1962 the Aeroflot Tupolev Tu-104 lost control after the airframe started vibrating, resulting in the plane rolling and yawing several times at an altitude of 4,500 meters before crashing. The aircraft crashed into a swamp, some 90 kilometers away from Khabarovsk. At the time, it was the deadliest crash in the history of Soviet aviation.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Tupolev Tu-104A with two Mikulin AM-3M engines registered to Aeroflot as CCCP-42366. The aircraft was produced by the Omsk factory and was released to the Khabarovsk Far East Civil Aviation Directorate division of Aeroflot on 27 September 1958. The cabin of the aircraft had 70 seats; despite this 79 passengers were allowed on board. At the time of the accident the aircraft had 4,426 flight hours and sustained 1,760 pressurization cycles.  Passengers and crew  On board the aircraft were 79 passengers, of which 58 were adults and 21 were children. Seven crew members were also aboard the flight. The cockpit crew consisted of the following: * Captain Petr Vasilievich Marsakov, serving as pilot in command * Co-Pilot Viktor Mikhailovich Gritsenko * Navigator Vasily Petrovich Zalavsky * Flight Engineer Yuri Ivanovich Gusynin * Radio operator Oleg Stepanovich Morozov  Description of accident  The air traffic controller instructed to follow the established corridor Troitskoe. Mild stratocumulus clouds were present along the designated route. At an altitude of 4,000 meters the aircraft ceased communications with Khabarovsk air traffic control, proceeding along the designated route. At 21:39 local time the pilot switched air traffic controllers, and after receiving permission started increasing altitude to 8,000 meters. The aircraft started experiencing control difficulties at 4,500 meters, approximately 1 minute and 37 seconds after the last communications with air traffic control. The pilots expressed dismay at the sharp roll of the wings; the aircraft disappeared from radar 36 seconds later, crashing into a swamp. All passengers and crew were killed in the crash.  Cause  No official cause of the accident was discovered, but it was determined that the autopilot feature could have improved some aspects of control. The commission responsible for investigating the accident concluded that:It is worth noting that the civil commission was not allowed to review materials falling under the classification \\"Military Secret\\". This has led to so theories that the aircraft could have been accidentally shot down by a surface-to-air missile launched from the Litovko military base.

It was the first of a series of deadly raids on Pennsylvania settlements by Native Americans allied with the French in the French and Indian War. Of the 26 settlers they found living on Penn's Creek, the Lenape killed 14 and took 11 captive (one man was wounded but managed to escape). Three of the preteen girls who were taken captive regained their freedom after years of slavery, and their stories have been popularized in several young adult novels and a film. The Lenape had been angered by years of European settlers encroaching on their land. They had lost their traditional lands in the Lehigh Valley to the provincial government of Pennsylvania in a fraudulent deal known as the Walking Purchase, and many of them had subsequently moved into the Susquehanna Valley by permission of the Iroquois. One year before the Penn's Creek massacre, the Iroquois had sold much of the Susquehanna Valley to the governments of Pennsylvania and Connecticut without consulting the Lenape, who once again found themselves being displaced by arriving settlers. As a direct result of the Penn's Creek massacre and subsequent raids, Pennsylvania assemblyman Benjamin Franklin persuaded the governor and assembly of the province to abandon its roots in Quaker pacifism and establish an armed military force and a chain of forts to protect the settlements. Franklin himself helped to organize and train the first Pennsylvania regiments. The Lenape and other displaced Native Americans continued their attacks on settlers and battles with the provincial forces for three years, until the Treaty of Easton was signed between the tribes and the British in 1758. Background = Albany and Walking Purchases = left One year before the massacre, delegates from seven colonies met with 150 leaders from the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy at the 1754 Albany Congress. The purpose of the gathering was to solidify the alliance between the British and the Iroquois in the face of a growing French challenge to British control of the colonies. During the Albany Congress, the Iroquois sold much of the Susquehanna Valley to a delegation from the provincial government of Pennsylvania, which sought the land for the purpose of opening it up to European settlement, in a deal that became known as the Albany Purchase.. Two of the men in this Pennsylvania delegation were Benjamin Franklin and John Penn, the grandson of the province's founder, William Penn. The Iroquois reserved some parts of the Susquehanna Valley, including the sub-valley called the Wyoming Valley, from the sale for the use of themselves and their allies, but only days after they signed the agreement, a delegation from Connecticut plied the Iroquois leaders with rum and induced them to sign over the Wyoming Valley while they were intoxicated.. Although the provincial governments recognized the Iroquois as the sole owners of the land, the Lenape had been living in the Wyoming Valley and other parts of the Susquehanna Valley since having been forced off their own traditional lands in the Lehigh Valley of eastern Pennsylvania 17 years earlier by the 1737 Walking Purchase. In that event, John Penn's uncles (Thomas Penn and John \\"The American\\" Penn) had produced a copy of what was likely an unsigned draft of a deed which had been drawn up 50 years earlier, when their father William Penn had been considering buying land from the Lenape; it stated that the Lenape had sold William Penn as much land in their valley as could be walked by a man in a day-and-a-half. Although the Lenape protested the validity of the document, they were told by the provincial government that it was legally binding. Believing they had no choice, four Lenape chiefs signed an agreement to abide by the terms of the deed after their more powerful allies the Iroquois, whose protection the Lenape were under by an agreement between the two tribes wherein the Iroquois were the \\"men\\" and the Lenape the \\"women\\" in their relationship, refused to intervene on their behalf.. The Penn brothers then hired the three fastest runners in the colony to take the \\"walk\\" and had paths secretly cleared and marked ahead of them. Two of the three runners gave up well before the allotted time ran out, but one, Edward Marshall, managed to cover about 65 miles in 18 hours, resulting in all of the Lenape's land being taken from them.. In a 1743 communication to the governor of Pennsylvania, the Iroquois confederation overseer, Oneida chief Shikellamy, had complained about white settlers encroaching into the Susquehanna Valley. In that message, Shikellamy stated that the Iroquois had granted the land surrounding a Susquehanna tributary, the Juniata River, \\"to our cousins the Delawares (Lenape) and our brethren the Shawanese (Shawnee) for a hunting-ground, and we ourselves hunt there sometimes.\\". Nevertheless, the Iroquois did not consult the Lenape or the Shawnee before selling the land eleven years later to Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Thus the Lenape found their current home sold for European settlement. This resulted in a rift between the Lenape and the Iroquois and caused Lenape resentment toward the German and Swiss settlers who immediately began moving into the Valley.. = French and Indian War = One year after the Albany Purchase, the French and Indian War between Great Britain and France began, with each side seeking control of the North American colonies. Although the Iroquois refused to take sides for the first four years of the conflict and instructed all of the tribes under their protection to do the same,. the Lenape and the Shawnee broke ranks and joined northern tribes the Huron, Ottawa and Ojibwe in forging an alliance with the French.. On July 9, 1755, the French and their Native American allies decisively defeated a combined force of colonial and British soldiers led by General Edward Braddock at the Battle of the Monongahela in Braddock's Field, Pennsylvania, east of Pittsburgh.. Three months later, a French and Native American army of about 1,500 men prepared to march east in order to secure the Susquehanna River as a supply line. They sent ahead of them several advance parties of Lenape. It was one of these Lenape advance parties which came upon the settlement at Penn's Creek, located on the west branch of the Susquehanna River, in the early morning hours of October 16, 1755.. The massacre Before dawn on October 16, a group of eight Lenape warriors attacked the settlement of Penn's Creek. The warriors' names were Kech Kinnyperlin, Joseph Compass and young Joseph Compass, young Thomas Hickman, Kalasquay, Souchy, Machynego and Katoochquay.. After firing several shots, the Lenape first attacked the Swiss farmer Jean Jacques Le Roy before setting his house on fire. His body was later found partially burned with two tomahawks still buried in his forehead.. A spring that emerges from the ground near the site where his body was discovered is today known as Le Roy's Spring, and the tiny stream that flows from it into Penn's Creek is known as Sweitzer's (Swisser's) Run. Le Roy's son, also named Jean Jacques and called Jacob, fought with his father's killers but was overpowered and taken captive, along with his 12-year-old sister Marie and another young girl who was living in the house (Mary Ann Villars). When a neighbor of Le Roy's by the name of Bastian rode up on horseback, he was shot and then scalped. Two of the Lenape then traveled to the Leininger household, approximately a half-mile away. There, they demanded rum, but none was in the house so they were given tobacco instead. After they smoked a pipe, they stated \\"We are Allegheny Indians, and your enemies. You must all die!\\". They shot Sebastian Leininger and tomahawked his 20-year-old son before taking his daughters, 12-year-old Barbara and 9-year-old Regina, captive. Mrs. Leininger and another son were away at a mill and were thus spared.. Several of the Lenape took the prisoners (as well as horses and provisions they had plundered) from the Le Roy and Leininger households into the forest where they were joined by the rest of the Lenape warriors, who brought with them six scalps and stated that they had had a good hunt that day. Later, some of the Lenape went back into the settlement and resumed killing, returning in the evening with nine more scalps and five more prisoners: Hanna Breilinger's husband, Jacob, had been killed and she and her two children taken captive.. A settler named Peter Lick was also taken along with his two sons, John and William. Of the fourteen settlers murdered at Penn's Creek, thirteen were men and elderly women, and one was a two-week-old infant. One unidentified man was wounded but escaped and made his way to a nearby settlement to report what had happened. Aftermath = John Harris expedition = As news of the massacre spread, panic gripped the settlements.. Trading post owner John Harris Jr. wrote to the governor and offered to lead an expedition upriver to try to pacify the Native Americans and find out the mindset of those at Shamokin (now called Sunbury), since the Indians there were known to be friendly to settlers. He gathered a group of 40 or 50 men and set out on October 22. At Shamokin, they found a gathering of Lenape painted all in black who had come from the Ohio and Allegheny River Valleys. Andrew Montour, an Indian of mixed Oneida, Algonquin and French ancestry, was among those painted in black but was known to Harris and often acted as an interpreter. He advised Harris to return home immediately by way of the east side of the Susquehanna. Harris turned his group back but disregarded Montour's warning to stay on the east side of the river. As the group headed back along the west side of the Susquehanna on October 25, they were ambushed by twenty or thirty Lenape in what is now the northern end of the borough of Selinsgrove. Harris later reported that he and his men killed four of the attackers while losing three of their own number, and that \\"four or five\\" more of his group drowned in the river while attempting to escape. A doctor who was riding behind Harris on the same horse was shot in the back and killed. Harris's horse was then shot out from under him and he had to swim across the river to safety. On either that same day or the next, the Lenape crossed the Susquehanna and attacked settlements at Hunter's Mill. Upon learning of the ambush and subsequent attacks, the Seneca chief Belt of Wampum gathered thirty of his own men and set out in pursuit of the perpetrators, although it's not known if they met with any success. = Further attacks = Penn's Creek was the first of a series of attacks on Pennsylvania settlements by the Lenape and other tribes allied with the French. Two weeks after the massacre, Lenape and Shawnee together were led by the Lenape war chief Shingas (also known as The Delaware King and called Shingas the Terrible by colonists) in nearly wiping out the Scotch-Irish settlements in what is now Fulton and Franklin counties on the Maryland border, in what became known as the Great Cove Massacre. They killed or took captive 47 out of 93 settlers in the Big Cove settlement alone in a brutal incursion that lasted several days and saw children murdered in front of their parents and wives forced to watch their husbands tortured; one woman over ninety years old was later found impaled on a stake with both breasts cut off. Next, the Lenape attacked settlers along Swatara Creek in what is now Lebanon County and Tulpehocken Creek in Berks County.. In late November, a dozen Lenape led by the chief Captain Jacobs invaded Gnadenhuetten (now Lehighton), a farming community for Christian Indians run by Moravian settlers. Eleven settlers were either murdered or taken captive. From December 10 to 11, a half-dozen Lenape killed or kidnapped members of five farming families along the Pohopoco Creek in what is now Towamensing Township. They continued on to the area that is today Stroudsburg and on December 11, 1755, besieged the plantation of the Brodhead family. The five Brodhead brothers (Charles, Daniel, Garett, John and Luke) and their youngest sister, 12-year- old Ann, barricaded themselves inside along with some local settlers who had sought refuge at their home and fought an hours-long gun battle that ultimately held off the attackers. It was the first of several attacks in the coming years on the Brodhead home, and the family was widely commended for their bravery in battling the threat. There were only about 200 warriors among the Susquehanna Lenape, but their numbers were soon bolstered by approximately 700 Ohio Lenape who came east to join them in their raids. By March 1756, five months after beginning their killing spree at Penn's Creek, they had killed some 200 settlers and taken an equal number captive. Settlers across eastern Pennsylvania abandoned their homesteads and fled to more-populated areas to the south and east, in hopes of finding safety in numbers. = Pennsylvania's response = Pennsylvania had been founded by Quakers, and that religion's core doctrine of pacifism meant that the province's Assembly had always refused to establish a permanent military force. As the settlements were decimated, Governor Robert Hunter Morris and the Assembly argued over whether or not proprietary estates should be taxed to raise money to defend them. In desperation, hundreds of Berks County German settlers marched on Philadelphia on November 25, 1755 carrying with them the scalped and mutilated bodies of some of their murdered neighbors. They dragged the bodies through the streets with placards attached declaring that these were the victims of the Quaker policy of non-resistance. They then surrounded the House of Assembly and placed the rotting corpses in its doorways. left Benjamin Franklin sat on the Pennsylvania Assembly in 1755. Gauging the panic that was spreading throughout the province, he had strongly urged Governor Morris and his fellow assemblymen that military force was necessary in the face of the Native American threat. On November 25, the same day the settlers' corpses were left on their doorstep, the Assembly acquiesced to Franklin's proposal for an unpaid volunteer force and passed Pennsylvania's first Militia Act. Two days later, a defense fund was created by a compromise hammered out by Franklin and fellow Assemblyman Joseph Galloway; it allowed for the taxing of colonists but exempted William Penn's sons and their land in exchange for a contribution from them. By early 1756, construction was underway on a chain of frontier forts, including Fort Augusta in the northern Susquehanna Valley, that ran along the Blue Mountains from the Delaware River to the Maryland line. In mid- December 1755, two months after the Penn's Creek massacre, Franklin himself set out to help the colonists prepare for battle. He visited towns like Bethlehem and Easton, now crowded with settlers who had fled their land, and signed up volunteers. Franklin appointed sentries and organized armed patrols and defenses. On New Year's Day 1756, twenty new militiamen who were building a fort on the site of the Gnadenhuetten massacre were lured into an ambush and killed by Indians who had come through the Lehigh Gap. Stunned at this breach, Governor Morris granted Franklin blanket authority to appoint and dismiss military officers and distribute weapons in Northampton County. By February, Pennsylvania had 919 paid colonial troops, with 389 in Northampton County alone. Later that year, a law was passed that subjected the commonwealth's troops to military discipline, and in 1757, the last vestiges of pacifism fell as military service was made compulsory for men in Pennsylvania. Still, they could not stop the Lenape and their Native American allies from continuing the raids. Nor could the Iroquois Confederacy, which ostensibly had authority over all of the Native American tribes in the region and which had thus far remained neutral in the war. The Lenape, still angry over the sale of the Susquehanna Valley in the Albany Purchase, were further angered when the Iroquois noted their lesser status by reminding them that they were the \\"women\\" in the relationship between their two tribes during a contentious March 1756 conference of all the Susquehanna Indian leaders. An eastern Lenape spokesman spat back: > We are Men and are determined not to be ruled any longer by you as Women. We > are determined to cut off all the English except those that may make their > escape from us in ships; so say no more to us on that head, lest we cut off > your private parts, and make Women of you, as you have done of us. In April 1756, Pennsylvania declared that it would pay a bounty of $130 for the scalp of every Lenape male over ten years of age and $50 for a Lenape woman's scalp, or $150 for a male Lenape prisoner and $130 for a female one. New Jersey soon followed suit. Pennsylvania assemblyman James Hamilton justified the bounties as ‚Äúthe only way to clear our frontiers of ‚Ä¶ savages & ‚Ä¶ infinitely cheapest in the end.\\" There were fears that this would encourage indiscriminate killing of innocent Native Americans by those seeking payment, but as only eight scalp bounties were paid out by Pennsylvania during the entire colonial period, it appears that few were either willing or able to pursue such rewards. Fort Granville 1916 Marker Pennsylvania suffered a crushing defeat when Lenape war chief Captain Jacobs and 100 warriors burned down the newly-constructed Fort Granville, considered one of the strongest- built forts in all of the Americas, on July 31, 1756. After first drawing away much of the fort's garrison by attacking settlers in the region, the Lenape, along with 55 French soldiers, either killed or captured all of the 24 men who had been left to defend the fort, as well as a number of civilians who were being sheltered inside. In response, the province's militia went on the offensive for the first time with the Kittanning Expedition: On September 8, 1756, a Pennsylvania regiment led by Colonel John Armstrong raided the Lenape stronghold village of Kittaning (where unknowingly, some of the Penn's Creek massacre captives were being held), burning it to the ground and killing Captain Jacobs along with 50 other Indians. Only seven of the approximately 100 captives who were held there were liberated, however, and the ones from Penn's Creek were not among them. = Treaty of Easton = Teedyuscung, a Lenape who had led some of the raids on settlements, around this time emerged as the leader of displaced Native Americans who had taken up residence in the Wyoming Valley, a section of the Susquehanna Valley located in northeastern Pennsylvania. Teedyuscung asserted that he represented ten Native American tribes, including the Iroquois, and on their behalf, he entered into treaty negotiations with Pennsylvania authorities at a series of conferences in Easton that began in 1756. His main objective was to secure the Wyoming Valley for the Lenape, and he gave speeches denouncing as fraudulent the land deals made by the Penn family which had taken away Native American lands. He was aided and encouraged by Quakers sympathetic to the Indians' plight, but faced resistance from both the Penn family and the Iroquois, who claimed authority over all Native American lands in Pennsylvania and had not in fact appointed Teedyuscung as their representative. Although often a powerful speaker, Teedyuscung's chronic alcohol use also led to quarrelsome, drunken outbursts and occasional bouts of tears that made him a less-than-reliable leader and exasperated his colonial allies; he was eventually outmaneuvered by the British colonial government's representative Conrad Weiser and the Iroquois and failed to obtain the rights to the Wyoming Valley for his people.. Nonetheless, the talks he had begun resulted in the October 1758 Treaty of Easton, which ended Pennsylvania's war with the Indians and brought about an uneasy peace by restoring some of the disputed territory acquired by the province (including three-quarters of the Susquehanna Valley land bought in the Albany Purchase) to the Native American tribes and by promising that the British would not establish settlements in the Ohio Country region west of the Allegheny Mountains once the French had been defeated. In return, the Native Americans (who had just been badly defeated by the British at the Battle of Fort Ligonier and saw that the war had turned against the French) agreed to cease fighting for the French in the current war and end the raids on settlements.  The captives  The ultimate fates of Peter Lick and his two sons, Hanna Breilinger and one of her two children, and Mary Ann Villars have been lost to history. It is known that Jacob Le Roy survived captivity because his name appears on a later deed in which he sold Le Roy family property, but there is no record of how or when he came to be freed. = Marie Le Roy and Barbara Leininger = The Lenape who had not traveled east after the massacre next took their prisoners and headed west. Twelve-year-old girls Marie Le Roy and Barbara Leininger were given as property to the Lenape warrior named Kalasquay. Barbara attempted to escape but was almost immediately recaptured and condemned to be burned to death. She was given a Bible and a fire was built, but just as she was about to be thrown into the flames, a young Lenape begged so earnestly for her life that she was spared on condition that she promise not to run away again and that she stop crying. The Lenape took their prisoners through forests and swamps, avoiding roads where they might be discovered. The captives were forced to walk barefoot over rocks and stumps until their feet were worn down to the bone and tendon and they were in agony. Their clothing, caught on brambles and branches, shredded and fell off. Older children were made to carry smaller ones bound to their backs. Marie Le Roy was separated from her brother Jacob when the group split up at the village of Chinklacamoose in their second week of traveling and Barbara Leininger was separated from her sister, Regina, at some unknown point approximately 400 miles from Penn's Creek. Marie and Barbara were in a group that arrived in Kittaning (then also known as Kittany) in December and included fellow Penn's Creek captive Hanna Breilinger and her two children. They remained there for nine months, until September 1756. They were put to work tanning leather, clearing land and building huts, planting corn and making moccasins. There was little food and at times the prisoners had to subsist on nothing but acorns, roots, grass and bark. One of Hanna Breilinger's children starved to death at Kittaning. In September 1756, the prisoners were taken deep into the forest when provincial troops arrived to attack the village during the Kittaning Expedition, and warned not to attempt escape. When the attack was over, they were brought back and found Kittaning had been burned to the ground. An Englishwoman who was also being held captive by the Lenape had attempted to escape with the provincial forces but had been recaptured and was sentenced to death. Le Roy and Leininger later recounted: Three days later, an Englishman who had escaped was also recaptured and tortured to death. Le Roy and Leininger would recount that \\"his torments, however, continued only about three hours; but his screams were frightful to listen to.\\" Due to hard rain, the Lenape could not keep the fire they had lain him in going, so they used him as a shooting target without killing him. When he screamed for a drink of water, they poured melted lead down his throat, which killed him instantly. Le Roy and Leininger: The girls were next taken to Fort Duquesne in Pittsburgh, where they were put to work for the French soldiers while their Lenape masters took their wages. Although they were better fed in the fort than they had been in Kittaning and the French soldiers tried to induce them to stay with them, the girls reasoned that the Native Americans were more likely to make peace with the English than the French were, and that they would have more chances for escape in the forest than in a fort, so they refused. They were moved to several other villages in western Pennsylvania by their captors over the next two years. Three years after the Penn's Creek massacre, in October 1758, the French and Indian army was badly defeated by the English in the Battle of Fort Ligonier. This caused a panic among the Native Americans of western Pennsylvania, who decided to sign the Treaty of Easton and abandon the war. They burned their crops and villages before fleeing 150 miles farther west to the village of Moschkingo in Ohio. Forced to go along, the now 15-year-old Marie Le Roy and Barbara Leininger met a young English captive there named David Breckenridge. They made a plan to escape with him and another young Englishman, Owen Gibson. On March 16, 1759, while most of the Lenape men were away selling pelts, the four young people fled east on foot. They endured a series of hardships on their 250-mile journey to Fort Pitt in Pittsburgh They traveled over one hundred miles in the first four days to reach the Ohio River. Leininger nearly drowned crossing Little Beaver Creek, Owen Gibson was wounded by a bear he had shot, they ran out of provisions and Gibson lost his flint and steel, leaving them to spend the last four nights of their journey sleeping in the snow with no fire. Nonetheless, all four made it to Fort Pitt and safety on the last night of March. A month later, Le Roy and Leininger were taken to Philadelphia. They related the story of their captivity later that year in a published pamphlet titled The Narrative of Marie le Roy and Barbara Leininger, for Three Years Captives Among the Indians. At the end of this narrative, Barbara and Marie listed the names, place of capture and last known locations of over 50 other captives they had met during their time with the Lenape, in order that their relatives might know they were still alive and have hope of seeing them again. They stated that they had also met many other captives whose names they either did not know or could not recall. = Regina Leininger = Nine-year-old Regina Leininger was separated from her sister Barbara early in their captivity and given as a slave to an old Lenape woman, along with a two-year-old girl who had been captured from another settlement. The two girls were treated very harshly by their mistress, who often beat them and drove them into the woods to find roots and berries to feed themselves whenever her son, who supplied them with food when he was present, was away. They lived with the woman for nine years. An account of the end of Regina's captivity was told by the Reverend Henry Melchior Muhlenberg, patriarch of the Lutheran church in the United States, in his Hallische Nachrichten. alt= After the French and Indian War ended in 1763 with British victory, the Lenape were among a number of Native American tribes who were dissatisfied with British postwar policies and with settlers continuing to move into the Ohio Country in violation of the Treaty of Easton. They took part in Pontiac's War from 1763 until 1764 in an effort to drive the British from the Great Lakes region, Ohio and Illinois. The effort failed and under peace negotiations with British Colonel Henry Bouquet, the Native Americans were obligated to surrender all of the captives in their possession. Approximately 200 captives were rounded up and brought to Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and word was sent out around the colonies for those who might have family members among them to come. Regina Leininger was by this time eighteen years old. According to Muhlenberg, her mother arrived in Carlisle on December 31, 1764 in hopes of finding Regina there, but after searching the line of captives, she was unable to recognize her daughter among them and was in tears. Colonel Bouquet suggested that she try doing something that would recall the past to her children, and Mrs. Leininger began to recite a German hymn that she had sung to her children when they were small, \\"Allein, und doch nicht ganz allein\\". In English, the opening lines are \\"Alone yet not alone am I, though in this solitude so drear, I feel my Savior always nigh\\". With those words, a young woman began to sing along and threw her arms around Mrs. Leininger. Regina had forgotten how to speak German, but she still remembered the hymn. Muhlenberg's narrative states that the younger girl who had been held captive with Regina was now eleven and refused to be separated from her. As she likely had no family left, Mrs. Leininger took her in as well and the three departed together. Reverend Muhlenberg neglected to give the family name of mother and daughter in his accounting of the story, and as a result, the captive girl was for many years misidentified as another kidnapped settler, Regina Hartmann. A 1905 investigation by the Historical Society of Berks County, however, definitively revealed her to be Regina Leininger: the description of her having been captured on October 16, 1755 along with her sister, Barbara, after their father and brother were killed and while their mother and another brother were absent could only have fit Leininger.  Memorials  The Pennsylvania Historical Commission and the Snyder County Historical Society jointly erected a memorial dedicated to the Penn's Creek massacre in October 1915, on the 160th anniversary of the massacre itself. The memorial is located alongside Penn's Creek north of Selinsgrove, near the site where John Harris' group was ambushed, and takes the form of a large piece of granite with two plaques. The upper plaque commemorates the massacre and the lower plaque on the granite block commemorates Harris' ill-fated expedition, reading > On October 25, 1755, John Harris, founder of Harrisburg, and a party of 40 > men who came up the river to investigate the John Penn's Creek massacre were > ambushed by a party of Indians near the mouth of this creek at the head of > the Isle of Que about one third of a mile south of this spot. There is also another stone block with a plaque at the site of the Le Roy house, where the massacre began. This one was put up by the Historical Commission in 1919 and reads > John Jacob LeRoy was killed by the Indians near this spot during the time of > the Penns Creek Massacre, October 16, 1755. This was the first act of > hostility by the Indians of this province following the defeat of General > Edward Braddock, July 9, 1755. A daughter of John Jacob LeRoy, Marie, and > Barbara Leininger were taken captive at this time and taken to Muskingum in > Ohio, from which they escaped several years later and returned to > Philadelphia  In popular culture  The stories of the three captive Penn's Creek girls who eventually found freedom again have been fictionalized in three young adult novels and a film: = Books = *Craven, Tracy Leininger.

It oversees the operation of California's bulk electric power system, transmission lines, and electricity market generated and transmitted by its member utilities. The primary stated mission of CAISO is to \\"operate the grid reliably and efficiently, provide fair and open transmission access, promote environmental stewardship, and facilitate effective markets and promote infrastructure development.\\" The CAISO is one of the largest ISOs in the world, delivering 300 million megawatt-hours of electricity each year and managing about 80% of California's electric flow.  History  The California Legislature created the CAISO in 1998 as part of the state restructuring of electricity markets. The legislature was responding to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) recommendations following the passage of the federal Energy Policy Act of 1992, which removed barriers to competition in the wholesale generation of electricity business. FERC regulates CAISO because interstate transmission lines fall under the jurisdiction of federal commerce laws.  Management  CAISO's leadership consists of executive management and a governing board members appointed by the Governor of California. The current executive leaders are: * President and CEO: Stephen Berberich (CEO Stephen Berberich) * Vice Presidents: Roger Collanton, Stacey Crowley,(Stacey Crowley, VP of External and Customer Affairs) Neil Millar, Petar Ristanovic, Mark Rothleder, Ryan Seghesio, Eric Schmitt, and Jodi Ziemathis. Renewables  In 2018, California ranked first in the nation as a producer of electricity from solar, geothermal, and biomass resources and fourth in the nation in conventional hydroelectric power generation. As of 2017, over half of the electricity (52.7%) produced was from renewable sources. CAISO provides a daily report on California renewable electricity generation, compared to overall system demand.Daily renewables report  Settlement for blackout  California Independent System Operator settled with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation for $6 million for violations of standards related to the 2011 Southwest blackout.  Deliberate 2020 rolling blackouts  Starting August 5 2020, CAISO ordered the utilities operating on its power grid to cut off power to 200,000 - 250,000 customers. While CAISO stated the high temperatures and corresponding high demand for air conditioning necessitated rolling blackouts, it enacted the blackouts with significant power reserves still being available. When causing the rolling blackouts, CAISO acted contrary to its own policy, with its 2019 resource assessment calling for stage 3 emergency only with 3% or less available power resources. When stage 3 was first enacted on 8/15, the CAISO power grid had 8.9% available resources, about three times the required threshold.

It was released on August 3, 2013, as a double-bill with Zyuden Sentai Kyoryuger: Gaburincho of Music. The film features Takanori Jinnai as Minister Auma who transforms into Kamen Rider Sorcerer. Jinnai is the oldest person to portray a Kamen Rider to date at age 54; the record was previously held by Hiroyuki Watanabe for his portrayal of Kamen Rider Gaoh in Kamen Rider Den-O: I'm Born! who at the time of filming was 51. Story The film begins with Haruto confronting a mysterious Golden Magician atop a building who is using an abducted Koyomi to perform a ritual. Kamen Rider Wizard confronts the magician, but fails to stop him from completing the ritual as he uses the Create Ring, causing a rainbow tornado to appear and engulf everything around them. When Haruto and Koyomi wake up in the next day, they find themselves in a different world instead, where all citizens use magic in their daily life and are surprised when they find Shunpei using magic as well and learn that he does not recognize them at all. While buying at the Donut Shop Hungry, Haruto is informed that in this world, the citizens' mana is used as currency instead of regular money, when an army of Ghouls led by a Phantom named Kherpi appears and attack the citizens in order to bring them into despair. Rinko appears to fight the monsters and Haruto and Koyomi are once again surprised by finding that all citizens have the power to transform into Kamen Rider Mages, including their friends, and defeat them without their help at all. Haruto and Koyomi explain their situation to Rinko, who also does not recognize them, but are suspicious of their behavior and arrest them, bringing them to their leader, Emperor Maya, whose real appearance is concealed behind a curtain. Haruto confronts Maya in order to learn if he was responsible for transforming the world in its current state, but is struck by a lightning spell instead and Maya lets them go after learning that Koyomi is unable to perform magic at all. While looking for the Golden Magician, Haruto and Koyomi are brought to Kosuke Nitoh instead, who takes an interest in their story and reveals that unlike the other citizens, he uses a handmade Beast Driver he created by studying ancient texts, that does not need to consume Phantoms to sustain itself. While taking a walk, they stumble across a Magic Ring Shop (the world's counterpart of Okagedomo Antique Shop). When a customer wants to know the function of the Flexible Magic Ring, Wajima appears, transforms into Mage and demonstrate the power much to the customers' disgust as they walk away from the shop save Koyomi and Haruto. Wajima introduces them to his worker, Shiina whom he also gave a shelter after his parents died. Temporarily, Wajima offers the duo a shelter too as Haruto reveals how did he and Koyomi get into their world to Shiina only for making him run away from the shop. Wajima reveals that Shiina's mother and almost everyone were taken away by a giant rainbow tornado with the victims are nowhere to be found. He also had met Emperor Maya and requested that he bring the victims back, to which he agrees and will try his best. While Haruto and Koyomi are trying to find Shiina, the Golden Magician appears and uses his Tornado Ring to cast away a group of female street dancers into a rainbow Tornado. He walks away, unknowingly watched by Shiina who suspected him to be the culprit. Koyomi meets a guy, who reveals to be the emperor as he desires to talk to her for a while. While Shiina chases the Golden Magician, this eventually leads him to a group of Phantom, which revealed to be the alternate counterparts of Phantom Generals. Shiina transforms and begins to fight. When Haruto was chasing for Shiina, he encounters Kosuke, who tries to fishing for mayonnaise, much to Haruto's shock. Haruto asks whether he sees Shiina or not but later interrupted when they realize that Shiina is under attack. As they arrive, Shiina is already under despair with the duo transforms and easily kill the Phantoms. They dive into Shiina's Underworld and finally found his inner Phantom, Ouroboros. As the inner Phantom get tied, Wizard and Beast use this chance to perform Kick Strike, with both of their Phantoms transform into their Strike Phase and strike Ouroboros. Shiina awakens, revealing he saw the Golden Magician too retreated to Maya's castle, believing Maya is the culprit. Haruto calms the boy and prepares to investigate the castle again. As he manages to sneak into the castle with Kosuke, they then enter a chamber that shown a machine. Kosuke then reveals to Haruto that the emperor is using a forbidden machine that has the citizens mana, which made Haruto thinking about the Magic Scanners in the city (also knowing where the missing people were taken to). Among the skeletons which stacked at the machine, he saw one of it possessing Shiina's Flower Ring, hinting the bearer to be the corpse of Shiina's mother. As they hear footsteps, they hide as the emperor was having a meeting with the Prime Minister about the machine. After the meeting, the emperor then reveals the purpose of using the machine by draining the citizens' magic. Kosuke accidentally got their cover blown as they escape from the emperor. While running, Kosuke tells Haruto that the emperor would die alone as it is impossible to gather all the mana into a machine. Sorcerer appears and attacks them as they transform, Beast let Wizard escape to tell the citizens of the emperor's plan as he continues to fight Sorcerer alone. Sorcerer overpowers Beast as he uses the Vanish Strike Ring to finish off Beast. Back in the shop, Shiina tries to use magic but he notices that he can't use it as Koyomi reveals to him that Haruto enters his Underworld in order to save him from despair, however, Shiina doesn't believe what she said. Haruto tries telling his friends about the emperor's plan as no one believed him as the emperor made an announcement of capturing Haruto and telling the citizens a lie about Haruto's plan. After the announcement, guards appears to capture Haruto as he rides his Machine Winger to escape from the guards. While being chased by the Mages, Haruto transform and outsmart them. Wizard then shoots the Magic Scanners until the Captain of the guards stops him. The captain transforms and fight Wizard as he still trying to tell them the truth. The citizens started to hate Wizard after hearing what the emperor said as they throw stuff at him, until Koyomi stops them. She then defends Haruto along with his friends as Koyomi tells him that the emperor is suffering alone. Haruto decides to ride to the castle as Rinko and Shunpei transform to fight the guards. Overpowered by the guards, Kosuke arrives and reveal to the captain that he survive Sorcerer's attack as he transform and overpowers the guards. As Haruto arrives to the chamber, he is too late to stop Maya from activating the machine as the citizens suffer from losing mana (less Koyomi and Shiina). Maya then reveals to Haruto that he is not a magician as no one would accept him. Sorcerer enters the chamber as he reveal himself to be the Drake Phantom and telling Maya the true purpose of the machine: getting all the citizens falling into despair.

As Irvine puts it, \\"just as being physically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of physics, being logically possible means nothing more than being consistent with the laws of logic. However, this leaves open the question of which logic and which consistency relation are to be adopted. S7 gives us the language to discuss the possible denial of necessary truths.

Biography  After completing his basic education, a friend of the family provided the assistance he needed to study with in Lund, who taught him drawing. On his recommendation, Palm was able to make some illustrations for a book on European algae by the botanist, Carl Adolph Agardh. He then attended the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts and supported himself by doing more illustrations; notably for the zoologist, Sven Nilsson. His early paintings were landscapes in the Romantic style that showed the influence of Carl Johan Fahlcrantz. After a trip to Norway in 1833, with Count , who dabbled in lithography, he came under the influence of Johan Christian Dahl and began to depict nature more realistically. This change came to fruition in his book of lithographs from 1837.Gunnar Carlquist (ed.) Svensk uppslagsbok, Vol. 20 pg.1186, 1937 That same year, he went to Berlin for treatment of an unspecified eye disease. Rather than returning home, he travelled throughout Germany and spent two years in Vienna; finally arriving in Rome in 1840. That winter, he went to Venice, filling sketchbooks that he took back to Rome. Altogether, he spent eleven years in Italy, becoming part of a local community of Swedish artists that dominated the Swedish art scene until the ascension of the D√ºsseldorf School. In 1851, he toured through Spain and Paris on his way back to Sweden. The following year, he was named a member of the Royal Academy. In 1856, he married Eva Sandberg, the daughter of Professor Johan Gustaf Sandberg. Their daughter, Anna Palm de Rosa, also became a painter. He began teaching at the Academy in 1859. His students gave him the nickname \\"Palma Vecchio\\" (Old Palm, in Italian), and he began signing his paintings with a picture of a palm tree. Upon his retirement in 1880, he was named Professor Emeritus. He remained uninfluenced by the new styles of art that developed during his last years.

Northampton \\"The Cotton Mill on the River Nen\\", (Marvel's Mill) from Noble and Butlin's 1746 map of Northampton ‚Äì the earliest known pictorial representation of a cotton mill Although his origin and early life are obscure, he was probably born in Somerset and is first known as a wheelwright skilled in \\"turning iron & Brass, & making machinery for grinding\\" recruited by Edward Cave to operate a water-powered cotton roller-spinning mill at Northampton in 1741 under licence from Lewis Paul. He was here with his wife Sarah and their son James. Yeoman established himself as a millwright constructing machinery such as ventilators invented by the clergyman Stephen Hales and began to take an active part in Northampton's business. Yeoman was a notable member of the local Baptist Church in College Lane. Yeoman's contribution to society in general was rewarded when he became president of the Northampton Philosophical Society. This society met in his house and included the inventor William Shipley and nonconformist leader Philip Doddridge among its members. As his social standing rose he moved first to Gold Street, where he built and sold scientific instruments, and then to Bridge Street. His ventilators sold as far as Rotterdam, for use on the British merchant fleet. He also first surveyed the river Nene in 1744. Yeoman and his wife had another son, Samuel, before Sarah died in 1746. He married Anne Remington on 18 August 1747 and they had a son Thomas in 1748 and a daughter Anne in 1752. London In 1756, Yeoman moved to London where he advertised his services in The Gentleman's Magazine and took up residence in Little Peter Street, Westminster. He had Admiralty contracts to install ventilators both in ships of the fleet and in their naval hospitals. He also ventilated the Drury Lane Theatre and the Houses of Parliament. He was elected to the Society of Arts which was founded by his friend William Shipley in the 1760s. He introduced other members and he was the active chairman of the Committee of Mechanics for many years. Limehouse cut, connecting the Lee Navigation to the Thames On arrival in London he gave evidence to the parliamentary commission for the River Nene and in 1758 was employed as surveyor and engineer on the works. After this his main work was as surveyor and engineer on numerous canal and river navigations including the Stort, Lea, Chelmer, Medway, Stroud and Thames. In many of these he worked as an assistant to John Smeaton and a major achievement was the Limehouse Cut which allowed shipping to avoid the sinuous River Lea. As early as 1763 he was described as a \\"surveyor and civil engineer\\" by Thomas Mortimer's Universal Director, together with John Smeaton, one of the first recorded uses of the term. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1764, described on his application citation as an Inspector of Ventilators in his Majestys Fleet. In 1771 Smeaton and Yeoman were joined Robert Mylne, Joseph Nickalls (1725‚Äì1793), John Grundy, John Thompson, and James King at the King's Head in Holborn where they \\"agreed that the civil engineers of this Kingdom do form themselves into a Society\\".Mike Chrimes, 'Society of Civil Engineers (act. 1771‚Äì2001)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. accessed 12 Aug 2013 This was the \\"first group of non-military engineers in the English- speaking world\\". He was elected the first president of a Society of Civil Engineers in 1771 which was later called the Smeatonian Society. (This society was to become the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1818.) Yeoman probably made President because of his seniority but it was a position he approached with enthusiasm taking the notes for the first few meetings and also covering parts of its costs. Yeoman died a widower in 1781, being buried in Bunhill Fields.

Highly stressed members were steel, with duralumin elsewhere including the skin. The fuselages were deep-bellied and flat-sided with tandem open cockpits over the wing. On both aircraft, the pilot sat near the quarter chord position, with a slot in the fuselage below the wing to enhance his downward view, and the passenger was placed within a cut-out in the trailing edge. The tailplane was on top of the fuselage and the rounded vertical tail included a balanced rudder which extended down to the keel. The conventional undercarriage was fixed, with mainwheels on a single axle mounted on short V-struts and assisted by a tailskid. The V 40 and V 44 airframes were identical, but the V 40 was powered by a Siemens-Halske Sh 11 7-cylinder radial and the V 44 by a Bristol Lucifer 3-cylinder radial.

History and development Gaylaxy was founded by Sukhdeep Singh. In 2010, Singh was still an eighth semester BTech student at the Indian School of Mines in Dhanbad. Singh is the current editor- in-chief and is also a gay rights activist in India. The initial team consisted mostly of the editor's close friends and contacts. The first issue was published in January 2010, after India's \\"high court overturned a law that criminalized homosexuality.\\" The second issue of the magazine saw the launch of the website. Later, in 2013 this law was again reinstated, making being in a same sex relationship in India illegal again. After the Indian Supreme Court's decision effectively re-criminalizing LGBTIQ citizens in December 2013, a dedicated Hindi section of Gaylaxy Magazine was created with an inaugural issue of 8 articles. Sachin Jain joined forces with Sukhdeep as he wanted to positively and constructively channelize his anger and frustration at disparaging description of the community as \\"a minuscule minority with so called rights\\", rooted in the misconception that the indigenous queer movement is an elitist product of Westernization, liberalization and globalization. Gaylaxy also released an app on 14 February 2014 relating to the website and its content.The application is maintained by Apurv Gupta. In their effort towards going mobile, the website was also made available on news reading application called \\"Plash\\". The Gaylaxy app is considered a \\"possible first for the gay community\\" in India, according to The Times of India. Publication and content Gaylaxy was originally distributed as a monthly magazine. From 2011 to 2013, it was a bi-monthlyShruti Nambiar, \\"E-zine Expressway\\", The Indian Express, 16 November 2011 publication, distributed online free of cost. But from 2014, Gaylaxy is available only as a website and discontinued its pdf issues. The magazine claims to have a worldwide readership, with nearly 60% from India, followed by United States, UK, Pakistan and Canada. The magazine has contributors from all parts of India, including Pakistan. It has covered a wide variety of issues pertaining to LGBT in India.Anna Leach, \\"Indian T-shirt brand apologies for gay rape joke\\", Gay Star News, 25 April 2013 The content is generally made up of: * A cover story highlighting in detail various LGBT issues in the country. * LGBT news from India and around the world, details of film festivals, pride festivals, interviews. * Relationship advice, movie reviews, literature, fiction and poems sent in by readers, sexual health and safety, and tarot readings. * Personal articles sent by people about their opinions, lives and coming out. Each issue of Gaylaxy also carries a list of NGOs across India working for LGBT issues with their contact details. It has covered issues from all around the world including the anti-gay bills in Uganda and Russia, California Proposition 8 and LGBT rights in Pakistan. The magazine also publishes regular news articles on its websites about LGBT events in India.  Events  Gaylaxy has been organizing various seminars, events, ceremonies, workshops, awareness sessions for the community and at colleges as well. * In October 2016, it organized an event called \\" Breaking the Closet \\" wherein many activists including Gautam Yadav, Rituparna Borah, Anwesh Sahoo, Sharif D Rangnekar, and several people from the audience shared their coming out stories and the connotations of \\" closet \\". * It supported the pride march organized by Indian Institute of Technology Delhi and University of Delhi students where Sukhdeep Singh spoke about coming out. * In November 2016, it organized \\" Queer Carnival \\" where people from the LGBTQ+ community showcased their talent in singing, dancing, poetry etc. * It organized a workshop on Gender, Sexuality and Power in Presidency University, Kolkata on 15 December, through practical hands ‚Äì on exercises and interactive sessions.The workshop involved a journey through multiple exercises and interactive sessions to break down the stigma and silence the concerns issues related to Gender and Sexuality on campuses. Works Gaylaxy Hindi has published a total of 185 works by 53 contributors since 1 January 2014. The magazine has published an Indo-Pak gay love story called 'Zero Line' by a queer writer Hadi Hussain Bhatt from Lahore, reporting on issues and achievements of both Pakistani and Bangladeshi LGBTIQ movements, development of relationships based on trust with closeted individuals in the heartland and encouraging them to express themselves. Gaylaxy also interviewed Xulhaz Manan, just a couple of days before he lost his life to extremists in Bangladesh. In 2015, Sachin was invited to speak about our work with Gaylaxy Hindi at the Queer Asia Conference at the Society of Oriental and African Studies in London. In 2016, his article on Hindi queer writing, \\"(Not) His Master's Voice\\" was also published in an anthology about Indian urban queer spaces called \\"Queer Potli\\".  Awards and recognitions  Sukhdeep Singh, for his work on Gaylaxy and significant involvement and leadership in LGBT communities, was conferred with January Marie Lapuz Youth Leadership Award on 1 January 2017 by the South Asian queer organization Sher Vancouver.

Mentioned in the Domesday Book, in 1669, it was purchased by Sir Andrew Henley of Bramshill House, who then ran it. History The manor of Eversley for a considerable period was held by four freemen of King Edward the Confessor, but towards the close of his reign, that king transferred the overlordship to the abbey of St. Peter, Westminster. This charter was confirmed by William the Conqueror, and at the time of the Domesday Survey, Eversley, then assessed at four hides, was in the possession of the abbey. In 1280, the Abbot of Westminster, as overlord of Eversley, was summoned to show his claim. Though the result is not given on the roll, the abbot's warranty lay in the charter of Edward the Confessor. The overlordship continued with Westminster Abbey as late at least as the end of the 15th century, the manor being held by the annual payment of a yearling sparrowhawk. By the beginning of the 13th century, the four freemen had been succeeded in the actual ownership of Eversley by William de Wauton, who, in 1237, made an agreement with his tenant, William Banastre, about the mill pond in Eversley. In 1251, Gilbert de Eversley was holding a hide of land in Eversley of William de Wauton, perhaps identical with the William de Wauton who, described as son and heir of Amisius de Wauton, sold the manor and advowson of Eversley for twenty-five marks to Alan de Hagheman or Haweman and Amice his wife in 1276. Three years later, Alan and Amice granted the reversion to John de Hagheman, who as lord of the manor presented a rector during the episcopacy of Henry Woodlock (1305‚Äì16). He died probably in the king's service abroad about 1320, and was succeeded by his son Nicholas de Hagheman, the rector of Eversley, who in 1336 granted the reversion of the manor and advowson to Thomas de Bradeston and Isabel his wife, and fifteen years later gave up all his right in return for an annuity of twenty marks and an annual payment of five cart-loads of hay at the feast of St. Peter ad Vincula. In 1336, Thomas de Bradeston obtained a charter from Edward III, granting him free warren in his demesne lands of Eversley, a market every Monday, a yearly fair on the feast of St. Luke the Evangelist and the two days before and following, as well as a licence to enclose of wood and pasture in Eversley, and to make a park of it. He died in 1359, leaving as his heir his grandson Thomas, who at his death in 1374, left an infant daughter Elizabeth to succeed him. Elizabeth brought the manor in marriage to her husband, Sir Walter de la Pole, lord of Sawston, Meldreth, and Trumpington in Cambridgeshire, who died seised in 1434. Their only daughter Margaret, who had married Thomas Ingaldesthorp, had died in 1426, and the manor consequently passed to their grandson Edmund Ingaldesthorp, who was afterwards knighted, and died in 1456, his heir being his daughter Isabel, aged fifteen. Isabel married Sir John Nevill, who was created Marquess of Montagu in 1470, and was slain at the Battle of Barnet a year later; and Sir William Norris of Rycote, Oxfordshire, and died seised of the manor of Eversley in 1476. Her son and heir by her first husband, George, had been created Duke of Bedford by Edward IV in 1470, but, having no means of sustaining his honours in consequence of the forfeiture of his paternal inheritance, was degraded from the peerage by Act of Parliament in 1477. He died childless six years later, and his estates were divided among his five sisters and co-heirs, Eversley falling to Lucy, who married Sir Thomas Fitz William of Aldwark, North Yorkshire; and Sir Anthony Browne. By her first husband, she left children, Sir William Fitz William, Lord High Admiral of England, who was created Earl of Southampton in 1537, and died at Newcastle upon Tyne in 1542 while leading the van of the English army into Scotland. By his will dated 10 September 1542, the earl left most of his estates, including Eversley, to his halfbrother, Sir Anthony Browne, who died in 1548, leaving a son and heir, Sir Anthony Browne. The latter was created Viscount Montagu on 2 September 1554, and joined with his wife Magdalene in selling the manor, park, and advowson of Eversley to Deodatus Staverton in 1582. Deodatus soon afterwards engaged in a dispute with his customary tenants of Eversley concerning the woods growing upon their tenements, the payment of fines, and other customs‚Äîa dispute which was ended in 1586 by an award of the Court of Chancery ‚Äîand died in 1590. By his will, dated 8 April 1590, he left the manor to his brother Thomas Staverton, who before 1616 had been succeeded by another Deodatus Staverton. In 1669, Sir Andrew Henley, of Bramshill, purchased the manor from William Lucy and Anne his wife, daughter of Deodatus Staverton, and heiress of her brother Francis, and from this date Eversley has followed the same descent as Bramshill.

Tsianina Redfeather Blackstone (December 13, 1882 ‚Äì January 10, 1985) was a Creek/Cherokee singer and performer born in Eufaula, Oklahoma, then within the Muscogee Creek Nation. From 1908 she toured regularly with Charles Wakefield Cadman, a composer and pianist who gave lectures about Native American music that were accompanied by his compositions and her singing. He composed classically based works associated with the Indianist movement. They toured in the United States and Europe. She collaborated with him and Nelle Richmond Eberhart on the libretto of the opera Shanewis (or \\"The Robin Woman,\\" 1918), which was based on her semi- autobiographical stories and contemporary issues for Native Americans. It premiered at the Metropolitan Opera. Redfeather sang the title role when the opera was on tour, making her debut when the work was performed in Denver in 1924, and also performing in it in Los Angeles in 1926. After her performing career, she worked as an activist on Indian education, co-founding the American Indian Education Foundation. She also supported Native American archeology and ethnology, serving on the Board of Managers for the School of American Research founded in Santa Fe by Alice Cunningham Fletcher.  Early life  Tsianina Redfeather was born Florence Tsianina Evans at Eufaula, in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma), to Creek and Cherokee parents.\\"Indian Troupe Busy at Front\\", Muskogee Times-Democrat, 26 May 1919, p. 3.

Cadman, who was white, had studied Native American music from ethnology sources and was lecturing on it, starting in 1908. He also was creating work drawn from Indian music. In the summer of 1909 he went to Nebraska, where he studied Omaha and Winnebago music on the reservations. He also learned to play some traditional instruments. Beginning in 1908, Cadman conducted lecture tours speaking about American Indian music and performed recitals on the subject, including his own songs, and accompanied by Redfeather as singer. They toured both in the United States and later in Europe, so she became known internationally. As \\"Princess Tsianina Redfeather\\", she performed Cadman's compositions wearing traditional costume, with her hair in long braids. She beaded her own garments.Harry D.

Cadman's composition \\"From The Land of Sky-Blue Water\\" became Redfeather's signature song. She collaborated with Cadman and his librettist Nelle Richmond Eberhart in creating the opera Shanewis (or The Robin Woman). Its contemporary plot was loosely based on Redfeather's semi-autobiographical stories of Native American life, and was set in California and Oklahoma.Elise Kuhl Kirk, American Opera (University of Illinois Press 2001): pp. 149-151. The work debuted at the Metropolitan Opera in 1918 and was performed also the next season. Highly popular, it toured the United States. Tsianina sang the lead at some performances on tour, making her opera debut in the role in Denver in 1924.

Biography Ashford was the son of Daniel F. Ashford (1837‚Äì1902), M.D., who attended Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. In 1895, Ashford came to Tensas Parish to manage a plantation for Eli Tullis. He received plantation property thereafter as a wedding gift from his father-in- law, Joseph Moore. Ashford was a stockholder in the Panola Company, an agricultural firm for which Ashford's House successor, Joseph T. Curry of St. Joseph, was the secretary-treasurer. Ashford owned a stable of racing horses and was active in the sportsmen's group, the Cooter Point Club on the Tensas River.

After his death Benjamin went to Southern California and became a miner in the Lytle Creek mines. Killing of John Mason and the Trials of Benjamin Mayfield In April 1866, the outlaw John Mason intercepted and joined Benjamin Mayfield on the ride to Fort Tejon from his mine in Lytle Creek. Benjamin knew of him and that there was a $500 reward on Mason's head. However Mason was also protected by the large number of pro secessionists in that part of the state, that made collecting the bounty dangerous. Mason later tried to recruit him into his gang. When Ben refused, Mason threatened to kill him. Mason had also threatened to take the horse of another man W. H. Overton and kill him. That night while the three were in the same house, none went to sleep but in the early morning Mason lay down on his bed under a blanket, but was awake. Overton stepped out to look after his horse, then Mason tried to shoot Mayfield from his bed. Mason's pistol tangled in his blanket, giving Mayfield the chance to shoot him first.

The crash resulted in the deaths of all 85 people aboard the Lockheed L-049 Constellation and the destruction of the plane. An investigation concluded that the primary cause of the accident was the pilot's attempt to perform a visual landing approach under adverse weather conditions. The pilot had aborted the landing attempt and was not aware of his actual location while flying below the minimum safe altitude in mountainous terrain. He was likely attempting to divert to the airport in Reno, Nevada, by flying through a wide pass in the mountains, but crashed into the left shoulder of the pass. At the time, it was the second worst single-plane crash in United States history, and remains the worst accident involving the Lockheed L-049 Constellation. The airline operating the flight, Paradise Airlines, was a two-year-old company that operated discount excursion flights from the San Francisco Bay Area to Lake Tahoe. After the accident, investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) discovered multiple safety violations by the airline company and grounded all of its flights. After an unsuccessful appeal by the company, the FAA revoked the airline's operating certificate and Paradise Airlines permanently ceased operations. Accident Cloudy skies over Lake Tahoe showing the high mountains around the lake acting as a barrier in overcast conditions. The flight, flying as Paradise Airlines Flight 901A, was one of two daily passenger flights operated by the airline between San Jose and Lake Tahoe. It left the company's base at the Oakland International Airport on the morning of March 1 with only the four crew members aboard, and stopped at nearby Salinas Airport to pick up a group of 18 passengers before proceeding to San Jose Airport where the aircraft was filled to capacity with the final 63 passengers. Fifteen additional passengers were turned away because the flight was full. The 81 passengers and 4 crew members departed San Jose at 10:39a.m. for the 50-minute flight to Lake Tahoe. The passengers who had been turned away were bussed to Oakland to catch a later flight but that second flight was eventually cancelled because of poor weather in the mountains. The U.S. Weather Bureau forecast for Lake Tahoe anticipated poor conditions for aircraft, but after evaluating the data, the Paradise Airlines dispatcher predicted that weather conditions would improve by the time the flight would arrive, so he approved the departure. En route, the crew of Flight 901A communicated by radio with the crew of the company's other plane, operating as Paradise Airlines Flight 802, which had just left the Tahoe Airport. Flight 802's crew said they had encountered icing conditions at 12,000 feet, snow showers over Lake Tahoe, and that clouds obscured the tops of mountains in the vicinity. At 11:21 am, the pilot of Flight 901A, in the vicinity of Lake Tahoe, reported that he had located a break in the cloud cover, that he could see the airport on the south shore of the lake, and that he was going to proceed with a visual approach. At 11:27 am, the pilots contacted the passenger agent for Paradise Airlines at Tahoe Valley Airport to let him know they were approaching. The agent informed the pilots that the 11:00a.m. Weather Bureau report listed the weather conditions as overcast, 2,000 ft. estimated ceiling, with 3 miles visibility. FAA regulations required a minimum ceiling of 4,000 feet and 10 miles visibility in order to proceed with an approach, so a landing would not have been allowed. A witness on the ground reported that she saw the plane flying toward the airport, on the south end of Lake Tahoe, operating normally. She watched the aircraft approach the airport until it disappeared behind thin clouds, then heard the engines add power. Other witnesses a mile north heard a low flying plane, and later saw the aircraft flying north back towards the lake at approximately 500 feet altitude with the landing gear up, but the landing gear doors still open. Another witness further north saw the plane with its gear up and the gear doors closed, flying towards the lake. A different witness further north reported seeing the plane flying at around 500 feet altitude on a northwesterly heading, with the gear up. Shortly afterward, the weather deteriorated into blizzard conditions. At 11:30 am, three witnesses on the east shore of Lake Tahoe reported hearing a \\"large aircraft\\" flying overhead, heading in an easterly or northeasterly direction. It was snowing heavily and none of the witnesses saw the aircraft. Some witnesses said the engine sounds abruptly stopped but they had not heard an explosion or crash. The aircraft struck the ground near the crest of a ridge on Genoa Peak, Nevada. The ridge, with a maximum height of 8,900 feet above sea level, forms the north shoulder of Daggett Pass, a pass several miles across which has an average elevation of 7,300 feet above sea level. At impact, the plane first struck several trees on the ridge's west slope, and the damage to those trees showed that the aircraft was in an almost level flight attitude. The ground impact occurred just 25 to 30 feet below the top of the ridge, leaving a trail of wreckage approximately 900 feet long and no survivors. At the altitude the aircraft was flying when it crashed, it would have cleared the ridge if it had been only 100 feet more to the right. Paradise Airlines had been operating as an intrastate airline in California since 1962, and had not had any accidents in its history before this flight. It is the worst accident involving the Lockheed L-049 Constellation, and at the time was the second worst single-plane accident in United States history. Aftermath 2015 aerial view of Lake Tahoe from the east, with Daggett Pass in the foreground Because of heavy snowstorms in the Tahoe area, only limited search efforts for the missing aircraft were possible on the first day. Two small boats searched along a 10-mile stretch of the lake's shore, but found no traces of the missing aircraft by nightfall. Meanwhile, experienced ski rescue crews and mountaineers waited for a break in the weather before they could join the search. By dawn the next morning, the weather had cleared enough to start a large-scale search. Air Force Lt. Col Alexander Sherry headed the operation, involving more than 50 planes and hundreds of people. At 7:36 am, an Air Force helicopter spotted the wreckage of the aircraft on the ridge. A second helicopter landed at the site and confirmed that the wreckage was from the missing flight, and that there were no survivors. Douglas County Sheriff deputies led a group of off-road vehicles to the crash scene and left two deputies to guard the wreckage through the night. A bulldozer cleared a road to the site along an old logging track. Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigators arrived at the scene of the crash to sift through the wreckage of the aircraft for clues to why it crashed. Portions of the four engines had burned, and there was evidence that a small area of the crash site had burned for four or five hours. Most of the wreckage was shattered into tiny pieces, with only a few recognizable parts. The impact site was so close to the top of the ridge that the aircraft's nose wheel was found on the other side of the mountain. Rescuers predicted that because of the rugged terrain and the deep snow, it would take several days or possibly even after the Spring thaw before all the victims could be recovered. The first seven victims were brought to a makeshift morgue in the CVIC hall in Minden, Nevada, on March 3, where technicians from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began the process of identification. An additional 43 were brought the next day, with officials hurrying to recover bodies before an incoming snowstorm made them inaccessible. Recovery efforts were aided by the use of an Air Force Helicopter to lift the bodies down from the ridge. Two large Army jet helicopters airlifted three mobile hot air furnaces to the site to help clear away the snow. By March 6, searchers had located and recovered all but two of the victims. They were eventually located, but by March 9, officials had only been able to recover one of the bodies before poor weather forced them to halt recovery operations. The final victim was removed from the site on March 30. Douglas County District Attorney John Chrislaw reported that Paradise Airlines refused to pay the $300 () per victim mortuary expenses of handling the remains, leaving the victims' relatives to bear the cost, but company president Herman Jones disputed that, saying that the expenses would be paid by the airline's insurance company. =Airline grounded= Diagram showing different types of de-icing systems used on aircraft, including electric (1) on pitot tubes, windshields, and propeller blades, and air- inflated (2) systems on the leading edges of flight surfaces fed by hot exhaust (4) from the engines. After cancelling flights in the aftermath of the crash, Paradise Airlines resumed flights to Lake Tahoe on the morning of March 3. The FAA immediately ordered an emergency suspension of all flights by the airline, which took effect at noon that same day. The suspension order said that the airline showed \\"a lack of ability and qualifications to conduct a safe intrastate common carrier passenger operation\\". The FAA said that the airline could appeal the suspension, but that it would have to remain grounded until a decision was made on the appeal. FAA regional Director Joseph H. Tippets said that the reason for the strict restriction was that Paradise Airlines Flight 901A had taken off on its flight while the weather conditions at the destination airport were below the minimum allowable conditions. He also said the airline had also authorized its other aircraft, Flight 802, to depart Lake Tahoe Airport that same day, when weather conditions were below the minimum. Both planes were flying in conditions where icing might be expected, but neither of the planes were equipped with wing de-icing equipment. The aircraft's wing edges were painted black to give the appearance that de-icing equipment was present. Company president Herman Jones told reporters that he was puzzled by the FAA's action, saying that his understanding was that the FAA had found no problems with the company's operations or its paperwork. In days following the suspension, he said that he believed that the FAA's \\"over-restrictive rules\\" about flying in adverse weather conditions was to blame for the accident. He said that the flight was only three or four miles from the Tahoe Airport and that the pilot might have already had had the airport in sight by the time the Tahoe Airport agent informed them of the reported weather conditions with only a 2,000-foot ceiling. Jones said the pilot probably decided to divert to Reno in order to avoid receiving an FAA violation for landing below minimums, even though it would have been safe to land. At the outset of the appeal hearing before the CAB, Paradise Airlines unsuccessfully argued that the FAA had no jurisdiction over the company because it was an intrastate airline that operated only within state boundaries. Once the hearing had commenced, attention was given to the company's inexperienced 25-year-old dispatcher that had cleared the flight for takeoff. He had been employed by the company for only one month, had limited fluency in the English language, and in response to questioning by the FAA, was unable to identify critical weather terms that were present in that day's forecast. He testified that he had used his own judgment in predicting that weather conditions at Tahoe Airport would be safe enough for the flight to land, but under questioning, when he was given sample weather observations, he was unable to predict how those conditions could affect flight safety. In later testimony at the hearing, it was revealed that the company's Tahoe Valley operations manager had altered a 10:10a.m. weather observation report made by the airport's official weather observer on the morning of the flight. 24-year-old Raymond Rickard testified that he had added a minus sign in front of a meteorological symbol on the report, changing the meaning from \\"broken cloud ceiling\\" to \\"thin, broken clouds\\". He said, \\"I knew [the observer] would not let us dispatch an airplane under the conditions he'd written, so I just inserted the minus sign.\\" He said he did this after hearing the observer tell a pilot that it was all right to take off, so he thought that the observer had just made a mistake on the report. On the other hand, the observer testified that he had definitely seen weather conditions well below minimum operating conditions that morning. An FAA investigator testified that Paradise Airlines had violated civil air regulations several times in the three months before the accident, mostly involving weather conditions. On April 6, the company lost its appeal of the FAA order grounding the company's aircraft. Paradise Airlines president Herman Jones characterized the hearings as \\"a great miscarriage of justice\\" and vowed to keep the company's planes flying, with or without an air operator's certificate. FAA representatives countered that if the company attempted to fly without a certificate, U.S. marshals would seize the aircraft involved. After the ruling, the airline closed its operation at the Oakland airport. Aircraft Lockheed L-049 Constellation The aircraft was a Lockheed L-049 Constellation, serial number 2025 and registered with tail number N86504. It had been manufactured in December 1945 and had a total of 45,629 flight hours. It was equipped with four Wright R-3350 Duplex-Cyclone propeller engines that had undergone a total overhaul within the past 1,300 flight hours. The plane was owned by Nevada Airmotive Corporation of Las Vegas, and had been leased to Paradise Airlines since June 1963. In its past, it had been operated by Trans World Airlines before it was retired. Paradise Airlines had flown it a total of 551 hours. The FAA reported that the type of aircraft was well suited for operation in high altitude, mountainous airports, due to its relatively slow speed and high maneuverability. Passengers and crew Paradise Airlines Flight 901A carried 81 passengers and 4 crew on its final flight. Nearly all of the passengers were from the Salinas and San Jose areas. 16 of the 18 passengers that the airline had picked up at its Salinas stop were employees of the same company, the Monte Mar Development company of Salinas and Monterey. The pilot of the flight was Henry Norris, age 43, who had been employed with the airline since November 1963. He had 15,391 hours of flight time, including 3,266 hours in Lockheed Constellation type aircraft. He had served in the Air Transport Command during World War II and had flown as a pilot for Modern Air Transport and World Airways and served as the director of training for Alaska Airlines. He was unmarried and a resident of Alameda, California. The first officer, 28-year-old Donald A. Watson, of San Francisco, had been employed with the company since March 1963. He had 3,553 flight hours of experience, including 149 hours instrument time and 1,353 hours in the Lockheed Constellation. Before joining Paradise Airlines, he had served as a mechanic with Pan American Airways and a pilot with Flying Tiger Line. The flight engineer, Jack C. Worthley, 33, of Fremont, California, had been employed with the company since October 1963. He had 3,700 flight hours as a flight engineer, including 912 hours on the Lockheed Constellation. He was the father of three small children and was a native of Seattle. Investigation Investigators from the CAB, headed by George R. Baker, arrived at the headquarters of Paradise Airlines on the day the plane went missing, even before the crash site had been located. Just as company president Herman Jones was about to meet with officials from the CAB and the FAA the next morning, word came in that the crash site had been located. After the meeting, investigators impounded all of the company's records. More than thirty CAB investigators were involved in the probe, studying the maintenance records of the plane, interviewing witnesses, studying the weather reports, and examining pieces of the wreckage for indications of the cause of the crash. The aircraft was not equipped with a pilot voice recorder. All four propeller hub assemblies were located and shipped, with the broken propeller blades, to a shop in Hayward, California, to determine how much power the engines were generating when the plane crashed. By May 1, investigators had recovered the key instruments and the radio equipment of the crashed plane. A salvage operator began removing the rest of the plane, taking the pieces to a warehouse at Reid‚ÄìHillview Airport near San Jose and storing them there in case they were needed by CAB investigators. The CAB held a probable cause hearing in Oakland between June 2 and 5. The investigative team learned that pilots had made 11 reports of problems with the plane's directional instruments in the months before the crash. Testimony from the Tahoe Airport's weather observer repeated some of what was said during the appeal of the FAA's suspension of Paradise Airlines' operating certificate. The pilot of the Paradise Airlines flight that left Lake Tahoe an hour before the crash testified that he took off because he was verbally assured by the weather observer that the weather was clear enough, but the observer said that he did not recall such a conversation. The pilot was asked about the company's procedures for operating in bad weather, and the company's financial arrangements with its pilots, and he revealed that the pilots were paid a flat fee of $35 () per flight. The CAB hinted that the flat fee payment arrangements gave an incentive to pilots to avoid diversions due to bad weather because they would not be paid for their additional time. Investigators learned that neither of the company's aircraft operating at the Tahoe Airport had been equipped with de-icing equipment, and that Flight 802 had picked up rime ice half an inch thick when it was flying out of the Tahoe Valley earlier that day. They also learned that the maintenance records of the company's aircraft had several discrepancies, but that the FAA had no enforcement actions pending at the time of the crash. Previous flight crews had noted minor errors in the altimeters aboard the aircraft, and instrument repairmen had worked on both altimeters on the day before the crash. The right-hand fluxgate compass was known to be faulty on the day of the crash, with crews reporting that it was \\"completely unreliable in any kind of banking turn\\". Instrument technicians had worked on it just two days earlier. Investigators learned that there had been gaps in the cloud cover when the flight had arrived, but a snow squall hit the north end of the airport just as the aircraft was approaching from the north for landing. On July 15, 1965, the CAB released its final report. The report stated that the crash was caused by pilot error, a falsified weather report, and illegal maintenance practices. The accident report stated: The CAB report stated that maintenance had been performed on both altimeters and the No. 2 fluxgate compass transmitter on the evening before the accident. The maintenance personnel who had performed the work had also inspected and signed off on their own work. The report stated the mechanic who had worked on the compass had never worked on that type of transmitter, and did not refer to any technical publications for guidance. He failed to check the entire system and did not perform all of the actions outlined in the maintenance manual. The technician who performed the work on the altimeters could not remember whether or not he had secured the barometric adjusting screw that he had unscrewed during the adjustments he had made. The reinstallation of the unit had been performed by a mechanic who had never performed that type of work before, and who did not perform all of the checks required by the manual. The captain's altimeter that was recovered from the wreckage showed a pre-impact discrepancy that would have caused the pilot to believe the aircraft was flying 280 feet higher than its true altitude. In addition, the compass had an error of 15 degrees or more, which would have meant that the aircraft's actual course could have been more to the north than what the instruments were indicating to the pilots. Weather reports that were available to the company dispatcher included warnings of icing conditions in the Tahoe Airport area and that clouds and snow showers would be obscuring mountains in western Nevada. None of this information was communicated to the captain of Flight 901A before or during the flight, and it was possible that ice accumulation on the aircraft may have affected its ability to gain sufficient altitude to clear the mountains. The report concluded that when the crew abandoned the approach to Tahoe Valley Airport, they decided to proceed through Daggett Pass for unknown reasons, possibly to avoid an area of known icing that they had passed through during their descent, or possibly because icing was preventing the aircraft from being able to climb higher. The pilots would have been aware that an altitude of 9,000 feet would have given the aircraft 1,500 feet of terrain clearance through the pass's center, and an easterly heading from the southern end of the lake would have taken the aircraft through the pass's center, an opening several miles wide. The aircraft leveled off at 9,000 feet, either because the pilots believed that they had sufficient clearance, or because icing prevented further altitude gains. The report concluded that it was possible that the crew was unaware that its course, altitude, or both, were not being accurately shown on the aircraft's instruments, and that undetected tail winds might also have affected the flight's course.

In 1970 she co-founded Consumer Action Now, a non-profit educational organization, and in 1995 co-founded Clio Visualizing History, Inc.Cliohistory.org to promote history education. (In 2003 Clio changed its corporate structure becoming a not-for-profit organization providing educational films and online history exhibits and resources.) Biography Van Wagenen was born in Provo, Utah, in December 1938. She was raised in a Mormon family, but as an adult has explored other sources of religious and philosophical thought. She met her first husband, actor Robert Redford, in Los Angeles in 1957. They were married on September 12, 1958, in Provo, Utah, following a secret wedding a few months earlier in Las Vegas, Nevada. They divorced in 1985. The couple had four children. Van Wagenen received her bachelor's degree at Vermont College in 1982 and her master's degree in Public History at New York University (NYU) in 1984. Ten years later she completed her Ph.D. in American History at NYU. Her doctoral dissertation was published as a book, Sister-Wives and Suffragists: Polygamy and the Politics of Woman Suffrage 1870-1896, in 2003. In October 2012 she received the Distinguished Alumni/Alumnae Achievement Award from the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at NYU. She married George Burrill, Ph.D., the founder of the international development firm ARD, on July 17, 2002, in Shelburne, Vermont. Burrill is the Honorary Consul from New Zealand to Vermont. He was a US delegate to the United States New Zealand Partnership Forum in 2011, held in Christchurch, New Zealand, when a devastating earthquake struck the city. After his return to Vermont, the couple organized a successful fundraiser that netted over $70,000 for earthquake recovery programs. Van Wagenen serves on the Robertson Scholars selection committee, which grants scholarships to international students at Duke University and University of North Carolina.Robertsonscholars.org The couple established the New American Scholarship Fund at Champlain College in 2012. Since the 1970s, Van Wagenen has served on the Board of Directors or in other capacities with various charitable organizations, including Shelburne Farms, the Vermont Historical Society and the New York Women‚Äôs Foundation. She served on the Task Force on Appropriate Technology with the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment in 1977. In 1979 she was a member of the National Commission on the International Year of the Child. Professional career Van Wagenen first received public attention as the wife of actor Robert Redford. Van Wagenen was an executive producer of several films, including Miss America: A Documentary Film, broadcast on the PBS series American Experience in January 2002, and The State of Marriage, released in 2015. Her publications include the book Sister- Wives and Suffragists: Polygamy and the Politics of Woman Suffrage 1870- 1896 and the article ‚ÄúIn Their Own Behalf: The Politicization of Mormon Women and the 1870 Franchise.‚Äù  Activism  In 1970, Van Wagenen (known then as Lola Redford) co-founded Consumer Action Now (CAN), a not-for-profit educational organization in New York City, and served as co-chair for 10 years. The group included Ilene (Jones) Goldman (then the wife of screenwriter William Goldman), author Linda Stewart who acted as editor and a major writer of the CAN monthly newsletter, Cynthia (Burke) Stein, author Irmgard Hunt, and a dozen other women. CAN established a variety of consumer-oriented and environmental education programs aimed at showing consumers how their buying habits affected the environment. For more than a decade, she promoted CAN‚Äôs goals through a series of public speaking engagements, including local and national television shows. In 1972, she organized the Environmental Action Forum, a gathering for consumer and environmental activists; the event was hosted by Betty Furness and featured speakers from a variety of environmental and civic organizations. Van Wagenen organized CAN‚Äôs political action council, which lobbied for passage of the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (both passed in 1976). The CAN Newsletter was published monthly from 1970 to 1973, covering different consumer education subjects in each issue. Van Wagenen wrote articles or conducted research for each issue and worked to expand the circulation, which reached readers nationwide. From 1975 to 1977, Van Wagenen developed The Sun Fund as a tool for raising awareness of energy conservation and alternative energy sources. The project included the Solar Energy Slide Show, which was the basis for The Solar Film, a 1980 Academy Award Nominee for Best Live Action Short Film. In 1978, she organized SunDay in New York, a three-day nationally televised educational and environmental celebration that began with a sunrise ceremony at the United Nations and included events sponsored by New York Institute of Technology and the U.S. Small Business Administration. Speakers at various SunDay events included Margaret Mead, Dr. Barry Commoner, Pete Seeger and Amory Lovins. In 1979 and 1980, Van Wagenen organized the Women‚Äôs Energy Education Project, coordinating with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Energy to publish Women Tapping a New Resource for Energy, Women‚Äôs Energy Handbook, and Women‚Äôs Energy Toolkit. In 1979 she received an Honorary Doctorate in Science from the Pratt Institute for promoting energy conservation and increased use of renewable energy resources.  Film and website production  After completing her Ph.D. in American history in 1995, Van Wagenen and historian Jeanne Houck cofounded Clio Visualizing History, Inc., intending to bring American history to a broad public audience. As executive producer for the documentary film Miss America: A Documentary Film, for PBS American Experience, Van Wagenen obtained funding for the project from The National Endowment for the Humanities. However, her subsequent film projects received only partial funding or none; a film proposal called Catching the Shadow: America‚Äôs First Women Photographers received a scripting grant from the NEH, but other proposals, such as The Battle of the Sexes: Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs, were eventually shelved. Smaller educational projects were more successful, as Clio provided research and production services for clients such as McGraw-Hill, The Asia Society and City Lore. Productions included CD-ROMs to accompany textbooks, web-based interactive materials, and an interactive kiosk. In 2003 Jeanne Houck departed and Van Wagenen reorganized Clio‚Äôs corporate structure, changing it to a not-for-profit educational organization. Research materials gathered for the film proposal Catching the Shadow: America‚Äôs First Women Photographers were adapted for use in online exhibits about Frances Benjamin Johnston and Mary and Frances Allen. Clio developed an interactive online version of Gregory Pfizer‚Äôs book Picturing the Past: Illustrated Histories and the American Imagination, 1840-1900, and produced ‚ÄúQuilts as Visual History,‚Äù researched by Jennifer Reeder, then at George Mason University. Clio‚Äôs recent projects offer more videos and interactive elements. ‚ÄúLowell Thomas and Lawrence of Arabia: Making a Legend, Creating History,‚Äù was a collaboration between Van Wagenen and filmmaker Rick Moulton. The exhibit features archival photos, audio clips, and a short film, presenting a variety of viewpoints on journalist Lowell Thomas and military officer T.E. Lawrence. Van Wagenen‚Äôs newest project for Clio‚Äôs website is titled ‚ÄúClick! The Ongoing Feminist Revolution,‚Äù a collaboration with Susan Ware, Melanie Gustafson and Marilyn Blackwell. This exhibit highlights the collective action and individual achievements of women from the 1940s to the present, and features 46 film clips (taken from 27 documentary films), extensive interactive timelines, essays and photos. While directing her online projects, Van Wagenen also served as executive producer on two films: Lowell Thomas: The American Storyteller by Rick Moulton (in production), and The State of Marriage by Jeff Kaufman (released in 2015).

Today these buildings survive as part of the SVF Foundation founded to preserve endangered breeds of livestock Arthur Curtiss James (June 1, 1867 ‚Äì June 4, 1941) was a wealthy speculator in copper mines and railroads.  Early life  He was the son of Daniel Willis James and Ellen S. Curtiss. His grandfather was Daniel James, one of the founders of Phelps, Dodge & Co. His grandmother was Elizabeth Woodbridge Phelps, daughter of Anson Green Phelps. James married Harriet Eddy Parsons in 1890. He graduated from Amherst College (Class of 1889). Business interests For many years, Arthur Curtiss James was the largest stockholder in the Phelps Dodge organization, but was an ‚Äúunknown captain of industry‚Äù, shunning publicity. His greatest interest was the railroad, and he became the largest private owner of railroad stock in the United States. He believed in the future of California and gained controlling interest in the Western Pacific line, Great Northern, Northern Pacific, Burlington, Southern Pacific, and other Western railroads. He had a dominant position in the control of 40,000 miles of track - about one-seventh of entire network in the United States. Before the Great Depression, he was one of the wealthiest men in America. In 1924, he was admitted to the Connecticut Society of the Cincinnati by virtue of his descent from Lieutenant Thomas Phelps, who had served in the Continental Army during the American Revolution.\\"Arthur C. James, 74, Rail Titan, is Dead,\\" The New York Times (June 5, 1941). The children of James's grandfather from his second marriage remained in England and took no interest in running the Phelps Dodge business. James remained on social terms with them and during a visit to England in 1909, he met King Edward VII at a house party given by James's half-uncle, William Dodge James. Residences His Newport, Rhode Island, summer residence was named Beacon Hill House. In addition to the house and gardens, James also built a replica Swiss village on his Newport estate which served as a working farm. The Swiss village was said to have been built as a replica of a village James and his wife visited on their honeymoon in Switzerland. The architects involved with the building of Beacon Hill House for James were Howells & Stokes. Stokes was Isaac Newton Phelps Stokes, son of James's cousin, Anson Phelps Stokes. Beacon Hill House fell into disuse and disrepair after James' death in 1941. It was torn down in the 1960s. The gardens of Beacon Hill House, as of early 2013, were in the process of restoration due to the patronage of Mrs. Dorrance Hill Hamilton. The Swiss village is now the home of the SVF Foundation, also a project of Mrs. Hamilton, which seeks to preserve rare breeds of livestock. He had his mansion, the Arthur Curtiss James House, constructed on 39 East 69th Street in New York City. There was also a \\"cottage\\" in Coconut Grove, Miami, owned by James. James also purchased a mansion in Sleepy Hollow, New York that had belonged to his cousin Anson Green Phelps Jr. (1818-1858) and his wife Jane Gibson. After the death of James and his wife, the house stood empty until it was donated to the Phelps Memorial Hospital Association; it is now a convention centre. Yachting In 1896, James took Professor David P. Todd and his team, who made up the Amherst Eclipse Expedition, to Japan in his yacht Coronet, considered by many to be the finest sailing yacht of its day, to observe the sun's total obscuration. Funding was provided by James's father. James was an avid yachtsman. He served as commodore of the New York Yacht Club from 1909 to 1910 and was the first commodore of the Ida Lewis Yacht Club in Newport from 1928 to 1932. The Aloha James' most prized possession was his barque-rigged 218-foot, 659-ton, sail and steam yacht Aloha. The Aloha was one of the largest yachts of its day and large sailing yachts were unusual at that time, as steam had become the preferred means of propulsion. The Aloha was built in 1910 at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts, and was acquired by the U.S. Navy during the First World War. Commissioned as the USS Aloha in 1917, she served as the flagship for the inspector of Naval Districts, East Coast, Rear Admiral Cameron McRae Winslow. After the war ended, the Navy returned the Aloha to James in January 1919. From 1921 to 1922 James took Aloha on an around-the-world tour and used her to visit Europe several times thereafter. Unlike most owners of large yachts, who hired professional captains, James made it clear that he was the captain of the Aloha and personally supervised the crew in their operation of the yacht. The Aloha was scrapped in 1938. As James did not own waterfront property in Newport, he purchased a narrow right-of-way off Harrison Avenue leading to Brenton Cove, where he built a dock and a boathouse for the Aloha. The property is named Aloha Landing. Due to the tight confines of the property, James is rumored to have installed a turntable in the boathouse to turn his car around. Death James died on June 4, 1941, just weeks after the death of his wife. He left about $38 million, of which over $25 million were put in trust to the James Foundation, for use in charitable, religious, and education institutions. The terms were such that the money had to be distributed within 25 years of his death.

Life and works  Originally from Glarus, Hauser embarked on his musical career at the age of 15 as a saxophonist. After two years at the St. Gallen jazz school, he studied at Berklee College of Music in Boston and graduated in 1993 with a major in performance. He spent further years studying with Kenny Garrett, Joe Viola, Hal Crook, George Garzone and Jerry Bergonzi. Furnished with a scholarship, he continued training at New York's Manhattan School of Music, where he refined his repertoire and became a professional musician. In 2011 he once again spent time studying abroad, in Brazilian Salvador da Bahia. His dealings with South American idioms and jazz improvisations influence his earliest compositions. As a band leader, Hauser not only realised his own projects, he was also the \\"side man\\" in a variety of formations and ensembles. As such he toured with the Swiss big band leader Pepe Lienhard, with Udo J√ºrgens, with Brand New Rhythm in Mexico and Europe, and with the Phil Dankner Seat Music Session in Switzerland. Of his projects as band leader, both Vol. I and II of \\"Boleros y Tangos\\", \\"There‚Äôs a Way out\\", \\"No Joke\\", \\"NuTube\\" and \\"A Tribute to Art Pepper\\" count among his most outstanding creations. Art Pepper, the American alto saxophonist, is one of his idols. Pepper's ability to recount fascinating stories with simple melodies impressed him. Hauser transcribed and arranged compositions of the alto saxophonist.Vgl. http://www.jazzinolten.ch/2004jazztage/2004jazztage.pdf ; The Return of Mark Hauser, in: Jazz‚Äôn‚ÄôMore, 05/2004. \\"A Tribute to Art Pepper\\" is both an impression of his intellectual creativity as well as his musical brilliance. A further project is \\"NuTube\\", presented by Hauser and Loris and Paolo Peloso. NuTube is a form of Nu Jazz, which came into being in the mid 1990s in countries including the USA, Mexico, France and Brazil. Hauser takes social trends of this style ‚Äì as are expressed for example in Herbie Hancock‚Äôs Future Shock or by France's St. Germain ‚Äì and develops his own musical concept from these. NuTube combines electronic music such as chill out and house with live instrumental music and is characterised by its polyvalent style, rhythm and formations. In addition to his work as a freelance musician, he is also a lecturer and examiner at universities and provides private tuition.  Style  Shaped by jazz from the 1940s and 50s (incl. Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Art Pepper) as well as his time spent studying with Kenny Garrett, George Garzone and Jerry Bergonzi, one of his strong stylistic anchors is embedded in hard bop jazz. His own compositions and solos have gained stylistic expansion through his time spent studying and on concert tours in Europe and South America. The incorporation and modulation of South American styles is apparent in compositions and arrangements such as both Vol. \\"Boleros y Tangos\\". \\"Hauser's pieces are sensitively and finely composed and arranged\\". The artistic identity of Hauser (in addition to his native German, he also speaks English, Spanish and Portuguese) can be described as polystylistic and cosmopolitan. He moves between jazz (swing, be bop, hard bop), South American music and funk, pop and rock. His music is on the one hand lively and full of energy, whilst also being sensitive, charged with emotion and an expression of a true passion for the transcendent.  ¬´hausertone¬ª  Hauser developed new mouthpieces for saxophones. During his time spent studying in the USA, the trained toolmaker embarked on research and literature studies in order to develop his own mouthpieces. Together with his brother he has been producing individual pieces aimed at the requirements of saxophonists since 2004. Since 2007, in addition to saxophonists in Europe, musicians such as Kenny Garrett and Chico Freeman have also been playing with \\"hausertone\\" mouthpieces.http://www.hausertone.com  Prizes, accolades and endorsements  Accolades and prizes * 1993 Scholarship from the canton of Glarus * 1999 Cultural award from the canton of Solothurn * 2006 Cultural award from Mexico * 2011 Cultural award from the canton of Aargau Endorsements * 2003, 2010-2014 endorsed by Selmer Saxophone, Switzerland * 2008 endorsed by Yamaha Saxophones * 2010 endorsed by Ford Automobile * 2012-2014 endorsed by AMAG VW Automobile, Switzerland * 2013/2014 endorsed by Poloshirts AD.M., Switzerland  Discography  * There is a Way out. 1994.

On 28 July 1962 the Antonov An-10 operating the route crashed near Gagra, Abkhaz ASSR, Georgian SSR, killing all 81 passengers and crew on board. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident was an Antonov An-10A with four Ivchenko AI-20K engines, registered CCCP-11186 to the Ukraine division of Aeroflot. At the time of the accident the aircraft had sustained 1,358 flight hours and 1,059 pressurization cycles. Passengers and crew 74 passengers and seven crew members were aboard Flight 415. The cockpit crew consisted of the following: *Captain Boris Mertyashev *Copilot Vladimir Sergeev *Navigator Grigory Karavay *Flight Engineer Vasily Kozyrev * Radio Operator Peter Shmygal Nuclear physicist Natan Yavlinsky, designer of tokamak devices, was on the flight with his family. Description of accident At 14:37 the An-10 departed from Simferopol Airport and proceeded on the route at an altitude of 6000 meters. At 15:06 the flight was passed over to Sochi air traffic control. At 15:29 the crew of the An-10 contacted air traffic control and were instructed to proceed on a bearing of 240¬∞ and given information regarding the weather; mild winds at 3‚Äì4 m/s were present. The controller failed to inform the flight crew about the cloudcover at approximately 600 meters on the mountains nearby. Shortly thereafter the aircraft was given permission to decrease altitude to 500 meters. At 15:37 the crew reported they were at the new assigned altitude and still on a bearing of 240¬∞; to which the controller responded with by ordering the flight to change course to a bearing of 60¬∞; after which the air traffic controller was replaced when shifts were changed. When the air traffic controller noticed the aircraft approaching the mountains, he ordered the flight to change course to the left by 20¬∞, when in fact it would have taken a minimum of 60¬∞ to avoid the mountains. At 15:41 and at an altitude of 500 meters, the aircraft crashed into the 700 meter tall mountain, killing all 81 people aboard the plane. Causes Numerous errors were responsible for the crash, including but not limited to: *The unsatisfactory flight plan, which established the flight approaching the airport at a bearing of 240¬∞ from the side of the mountains; *The approach configuration itself, which was not approved by the Ministry of Civil Aviation *Insufficient preparation for the flight to Sochi Airport by the crew, resulting in their following the air traffic controller‚Äôs instructions which put them on a dangerous course, causing the flight to enter the clouds and crash into the mountain. *The vicinity of the approach of aircraft to the mountains, specifically the distance of separation between incoming flights and the mountains. Aftermath After the crash the approach by the mountains was banned. All incoming aircraft to Sochi Airport now carry out approach over the sea.

It is listed as 1455 (see ), 1437 (see ), or 1447. was an English nobleman, politician, sheriff, knight, merchant, and landowner.  Life and family  Spencer was the son of William Spencer of Rodburn (1430‚Äì1485), and his wife Elizabeth Empson, daughter of Sir Peter Empson. In 1469, John Spencer's uncle ‚Äì another John Spencer ‚Äì had become feoffee (feudal lord) of Wormleighton in Warwickshire and a tenant at Althorp in Northamptonshire in 1486. The Spencers‚Äô administration of their Northamptonshire and Warwickshire estates was admired and often emulated by gentlemen all over England. Sheep from their pastures were purchased for breeding and it is probable that the family's success as farmers was rarely equalled in the century.Sir John Spencer, History of Parliament Online (access date 20 July 2013) The Spencers were granted a coat of arms in 1504, \\"Azure a fess Ermine between 6 sea-mews‚Äô heads erased Argent\\" which bears no resemblance to that used by the family after c. 1595. Althorp, the family seat of the Spencer family for 500 years Spencer first made a living by trading in livestock and other commodities and eventually saved enough money to purchase the manors of Wormleighton and Althorp. Wormleighton was bought in 1506, and a new manor house was completed in 1512. In 1508, John Spencer also purchased the estate of Althorp with its moated house and several hundred acres of farmland.H. Gawthorne/S. Mattingly/G. W. Shaeffer/M. Avery/B. Thomas/R. Barnard/M. Young, Revd. N.V. Knibbs/R. Horne: \\"The Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Great Brington. 800 Years of English History\\", published as \\"Brington Church: A Popular History\\" in 1989 and printed by Peerless Press. He had grazed sheep here from the 1480s. Impressed by the quality of the land, he eventually bought it and rebuilt the house in 1508.Sir John Spencer 1455‚Äì1522 (access date 20 July 2013) At that time, his estate and mansion in Warwickshire were considerably larger, the house in Wormleighton was four times the size of Althorp. In 1511 he made further purchases to acquire much of the surrounding countryside, including the villages of Little Brington and Great Brington as well their parish church of St Mary the Virgin, from Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset. By putting down roots at Althorp, Spencer provided what was to become the home for the next 19 generations. Between 1513 and 1515, Spencer devoted much funds and planning to the parish church for Althorp, St Mary the Virgin in Great Brington. In 1513, he appointed Thomas Heritage to be rector of the church, who had previously been chaplain to King Henry VII and surveyor of the monarch's works at Westminster Abbey. It is altogether probable that Heritage designed and superintended the execution of Spencer's idea for a family chapel at the parish church. His will, dated the 12th day of April 1522, just two days before Sir John's death, states that he virtually rebuilt the whole church. His bequests included \\"oon hool syte of vestments and a chales\\", \\"the making of the chauncell roffe with the ledde, wall and wyndowes, and my armes to be sett in the same wyndowes\\" as well as his tomb, shared with his lady Isabella Graunt. For this tomb, to be placed in the easternmost bay of the family chapel, nearest to the altar, he left the sum of 20 pounds. In 1519, Spencer was knighted by King Henry VIII. He died three years later and was buried in the new family chapel at Great Brington. His younger son and successor Sir William Spencer later bequeathed the church's east window of stained glass which depicted St. John the Baptist and the Spencer coat of arms, now in a south window of the chancel, in memory of his father.  Personal life  Spencer married Isabella Graunt, daughter of Sir Walter Graunt of Snitterfield, and had children. Their daughter Dorothy Spencer married Sir Richard Catesby MP (grandson of Sir Richard Empson, Speaker of the House of Commons),History of Parliament: Sir Richard Catesby, accessed May 2020. and had four sons and two daughters. Their great grandson Robert Catesby was leader of the Gunpowder Plot. Upon his death in 1522, the Spencer estates at Wormleighton and Althorp passed to his younger son Sir William Spencer, who died ten years later.

He was born at Whissendine, Rutland, and died at Leicester. Army service Snary joined the 2/6th Battalion of the South Staffordshire Regiment at the age of 18 and saw action in Ireland during the 1916 Easter Rising.Jonathan Farmer, \\"Horace Snary\\", The Cricket Statistician, Spring 2017, pp. 33‚Äì37. Having been promoted to lance-corporal he accompanied the battalion to France in February 1917. He saw action in the Third Battle of Ypres from September to November 1917, where he suffered lung damage leading to double pneumonia, ending his military career with the rank of sergeant. His twin brother William was killed in action in 1917. Cricket career Snary was a right-handed lower-order batsman and an extremely economical right-arm slow- to medium-pace bowler: through his career, he conceded only 1.72 runs per over. He made his first-class debut for Leicestershire in a couple of matches in 1921 but made little impression, failing to take a wicket. In 1924, Leicestershire, to that point one of the weaker first-class counties, decided that a more professional approach was needed for success; the club appointed its first-ever professional coach, the former Surrey and England player Ernie Hayes, and entered a second eleven in the Minor Counties Championship for the first time. Snary, Haydon Smith and Norman Armstrong were among players who later became prominent who were brought on through this system and in the team's first season in the Minor Counties Snary took 38 wickets at a cost of less than 12 runs per wicket, including a return of five wickets for six runs against Buckinghamshire. He made one first-team appearance in 1924 and three in 1925 ‚Äì finally taking a first-class wicket ‚Äì and then came into the team regularly in the second half of the 1926 season. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack noted that he was \\"able to keep an excellent length and make the ball go away\\" and that he \\"required careful watching\\". Snary played regularly in Leicestershire's first team from 1927 onwards as an accurate, containing bowler. He took 34 wickets in 20 matches in 1927, but doubled that to 68 from 30 games in 1928. George Geary had been out of form in 1928 and his return to bowling strength in 1929 meant that Snary played less, but he was again a regular member of the side in the three years from 1930 to 1932, and in 1931 he took 101 wickets in the season, at an average of 18.11. Snary's role was as economical back-up to Leicestershire's frontline bowlers and in no innings in 27 County Championship matches, despite taking 80 wickets in those games, did he take more than four wickets in an innings. Against Cambridge University, however, he took seven wickets for 31 in the University's first innings and, with three for 34 in the second innings he finished with match figures of 10 wickets for 65 runs in 61.3 overs, the best innings and match figures of his career. Snary's batting was not rated at Leicestershire until late in his career, and he spent most of his first-class matches batting at No 9 or No 10: a career average of 15 and an extremely high proportion of not-out innings ‚Äì 114 out of 249 ‚Äì indicate that he was probably under-rated as a batsman, but he only passed 50 once. That was in 1932 in the game against the Indian touring team when, having top-scored with 25 in Leicestershire's first innings batting at No 8, he was sent in to open the innings when the county followed on and carried his bat throughout an innings of 291, scoring 124 not out himself. The 1933 season was a poor one for both Snary and Leicestershire. The county finished bottom of the County Championship for the first time (it had been jointly at the foot of the table before, but never on its own) and finance became very tight. Snary's bowling was less effective in terms of containment than before ‚Äì he conceded runs at more than two per over ‚Äì and he took only 23 wickets, playing in around half the team's games. He left the staff at the end of the season and did not play any further first-class cricket. Later life After Snary retired from first-class cricket he returned to his native village of Whissendine, where he established a successful farming business producing poultry, fruit and vegetables. He also contracted to lay cricket pitches and tennis courts. He played for Whissendine Cricket Club until the 1950s. In 1950, when the owner of the club's ground decided to sell the land, throwing the future of the club into doubt, Snary bought the land himself, guaranteeing the club's survival. Towards the end of his life Snary suffered from ill-health, including glaucoma, which left him blind, and a recurrence of his wartime breathing difficulties. He died in Leicester Royal Infirmary in 1966.

In this problem, one is given n and an r-to-1 function f:\\\\,\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\}\\\\rightarrow\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,n\\\\\\\\} and needs to find two inputs that f maps to the same output. The BHT algorithm only makes O(n^{1/3}) queries to f, which matches the lower bound of \\\\Omega(n^{1/3}) in the black box model. The algorithm was discovered by Brassard, Hoyer, and Tapp in 1997. It uses Grover's algorithm, which was discovered in the previous year. Algorithm Intuitively, the algorithm combines the square root speedup from the birthday paradox using (classical) randomness with the square root speedup from Grover's (quantum) algorithm. First, n1/3 inputs to f are selected at random and f is queried at all of them. If there is a collision among these inputs, then we return the colliding pair of inputs. Otherwise, all these inputs map to distinct values by f. Then Grover's algorithm is used to find a new input to f that collides. Since there are only n2/3 such inputs to f, Grover's algorithm can find one (if it exists) by making only O(\\\\sqrt{n^{2/3}}) = O(n^{1/3}) queries to f.

It burned primarily in the San Jacinto Mountains in the San Bernardino National Forest. It started on July 15, 2013 at 1:43 PM near the junction of Highway 243 and Highway 74. It burned for 16 days on steep slopes of timber and chaparral above Palm Springs. Heavy rainfall, up to , on July 21 helped bring the blaze under control. It was fully contained on July 30, 2013. Cal Fire investigators said the fire was caused by a failure of \\"some type of electrical equipment\\" on private property and was not related to utility company equipment. At the fire's peak there were 3,500 firefighters on the lines as well as 20 helicopters, 12 airplanes and 260 engines. The cost of fighting the fire was estimated at $25.8 million. In 2015 Cal Fire sued Dr. Tarek M.A. Al-Shawaf, the owner of the property on which the fire started, and two of his employees, for damages in state court. In November 2018 they settled the suit for $1.6 million. A separate lawsuit by private parties was settled for $3.1 million. On the next-to-last day before the statute of limitations would run, the DOJ U.S. Attorney's office sued Al-Shawaf and his two caretakers in federal court for some $25 million in fire suppression costs and damage to federal lands. But in July 2019 the DOJ dropped its much larger federal lawsuit against Al- Shawaf \\"in the interest of justice,\\" citing the state court settlement and asserting \\"new evidence.\\" The DOJ U.S. Attorney's Office refused to identify the ‚Äúnew evidence‚Äù or further discuss the matter when pressed by the local newspaper, the Idyllwild Town Crier. Al-Shawaf is a wealthy Saudi businessman ‚Äî founder, president and chairman of Saudconsult, the oldest and largest engineering and architectural firm in Saudi Arabia. He also is a former official in the Saudi government. Initial response to the fire was also delayed by Cal Fire and Riverside County Fire due to a breakdown of an agreement made with the Idyllwild Fire Department, the closest fire station to the origin of the fire, causing resources from further away to be sent to the incident first. For a time the fire threatened the town of Idyllwild and other small towns. The Palm Springs Aerial Tramway and Mount San Jacinto State Park were closed due to unhealthful air quality, and many neighboring areas were warned of possible unhealthful air conditions. The fire reached to within 2 miles of Palm Springs, which was draped by a blanket of ash and smoke. Nearly 6,000 residents of the Idyllwild and Fern Valley areas were ordered to evacuate; those communities were not damaged by the fire and the evacuation orders were lifted July 21. Evacuation centers were set up at Hemet High School in Hemet, Hamilton High School in Anza and Beaumont High School in Cherry Valley. Evaluating the effect of the fire, scientists say it may prove to be healthy for the Mount San Jacinto environment, because in many areas it burned away the understory (leaf litter, brush and downed timber) while leaving the taller trees intact. Rich Minnich, a fire scientist from the University of California, Riverside, said this was a poster child for how Southern California wildfires should burn. \\"We got an old-growth forest that burned slowly in good weather,\\" he said. \\"We got a fantastic house cleaning. Someone finally vacuumed the rugs.\\" Ken Kietzer, a scientist with the California state parks, echoed the assessment, saying the fire appears to have worked out well for Mount San Jacinto State Park. \\"When the fire got into the park, it was for the most part not a crown fire. It was a creeping ground fire. That is going to be very favorable to reducing the buildup of ground fuels and thinning out some of the smaller, shade tolerant understory, which will probably in the long run be a benefit for the park.\\" A team of researchers from the San Diego Natural History Museum had been in the area studying the flora and fauna of Mount San Jacinto for comparison with a similar study done 100 years earlier by zoologist Joseph Grinnell; they were forced by the fire to evacuate their research camp. They are finding that the forest is much more dense than it was 100 years ago, partly due to decades of fire suppression. The increased density has altered the animal population as well as making the area more susceptible to large, damaging fires.

Johnson was found alive in July 2013 after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) reopened the investigation into her disappearance. Disappearance Lucy Ann Johnson is an Alaska native who, prior to her disappearance, was living in Surrey, British Columbia with her husband Marvin and their two children, Linda and Daniel. She was seen by a neighbour in the 10300-block of 145A Street, Surrey, in September 1961. Johnson was finally reported missing by her husband Marvin on May 14, 1965, who admitted she actually had gone missing years earlier. The police believed that foul play was involved in her disappearance, and her husband was suspected of her murder. Marvin was interrogated, neighbours were questioned, and the family's yard was excavated, but no evidence was found. The trail went cold and charges against him were never laid. Marvin later remarried and died in the 1990s of natural causes. In the years following Lucy's disappearance, investigators continued to do DNA tests on unidentified remains, but never found any matches. Rediscovery In June 2013, almost 52 years after Johnson went missing, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Surrey highlighted her disappearance as a cold case in their \\"Missing of the Month\\" series. Following that, Johnson's daughter, Linda Evans, decided to do an investigation of her own, and was able to find old documents indicating that Johnson had lived in the community of Carcross, Yukon, before moving to British Columbia and settling down. In July, Evans placed a plea for help in the Yukon News, stating, \\"I am looking for my relatives. My grandparents' names are Margaret [and] Andrew Carvell. My mother's name is Lucy Ann Carvell. She was born Oct. 14, 1935 in Skagway.\\" She received a reply from a woman named Rhonda from Whitehorse, Yukon, who claimed that Johnson was her mother. Johnson, who was then 77 years old, was discovered alive and well in Yukon; she had remarried and had four more children. Johnson said she had disappeared because her late husband Marvin was abusive, and that she tried to take her children with her, but he would not allow it. A few months after Johnson's rediscovery, Evans flew to Whitehorse to reunite with her mother and to meet Rhonda and her three other half- siblings.

Gates Monument to the 80th New York Volunteer Infantry at Gettysburg The 80th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, the \\"Twentieth New York State Militia\\", \\"Ulster Guard\\", was an infantry regiment of the Union Army during the American Civil War. Service On the return of the 20th New York State Militia Regiment from its three months' service, Col. George W. Pratt reorganized it at Kingston, New York as a regiment of volunteers, and it was mustered in the service of the United States for three years between September 20 and October 20, 1861. December 7, 1861, it received its State numerical designation, and May 24, 1863, the three years' men of the 35th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. November 6, 1864, a new company joined the regiment. The companies were recruited principally in Ulster County; men from neighboring counties also joined the regiment. The regiment left the State October 26, 1861; served in Wadsworth's Brigade from October, 1861; in Irvin McDowell's Division, Army of Potomac, from November, 1861; in 2d Brigade, McDowell's Division, Army of Potomac, from January, 1862; in Marsena R.

Jacob B. Hardenbergh, January 29, 1866, at Portsmouth, Virginia. The regiment left for Washington, D.C. and performed picket duty along the Potomac in the vicinity of Upton's Hill, during the first winter. It fought in Gen. John Pope's Virginia campaign. At the second Bull Run the 80th lost 279 in killed, wounded and missing, and Col. Pratt died a few weeks later of the wounds received in that battle. It was active at South mountain and Antietam, encamped at Sharpsburg for one week and marched through Crampton's Gap, Leesburg, Warrenton and Stafford Court House to Fredericksburg, where it participated in the battle. Winter quarters were established soon after near Hall's Landing and occupied until Jan. 7, 1863, when the 80th was assigned, to the provost guard brigade, with headquarters at Brooks' Station and remained on duty at army headquarters until after the battle of Chancellorsville. In June, 1863, the regiment was closely engaged at Gettysburg, where it lost 170 killed, wounded or missing out of 287 engaged. It suffered most severely in the repulse of George Pickett's charge on the last day. After the battle of Gettysburg, the 80th was again ordered to headquarters for provost guard duty and continued in this service until the end of the siege of Petersburg, when it shared in the final assault, April 2, 1865. From April 22 to November 27, 1865, it was stationed at Richmond and then ordered to Norfolk, where it remained until mustered out on January 29, 1866.

Developed from the AGM-84E SLAM (Standoff Land Attack Missile) (itself developed by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems from the McDonnell Douglas Harpoon antiship missile), the SLAM-ER is capable of attacking land and sea targets medium to long range (155 nautical miles/270 km maximum). The SLAM-ER relies on the Global Positioning System (GPS) and infrared imaging for its navigation and control, and it can strike both moving and stationary targets. The SLAM-ER can be remotely controlled while in flight, and it can be redirected to another target after launch if the original target has already been destroyed, or is no longer considered to be dangerous (command guidance). The SLAM-ER is a very accurate weapon; as of 2009 it had the best circular error probable (CEP) of any missile used by the U.S. Navy. History In 1999, Boeing and the U.S. Navy conducted a live fire of a SLAM-ER from an F/A-18 Hornet on the decommissioned USS Dale (CG-19) off the coast of Puerto Rico. The SLAM-ER obtained initial operating capability in June 2000. A total of three SLAM-ER missiles were fired by the U.S. Navy during the Iraq War,Cordesman, Anthony H. The Iraq War: Strategy, Tactics, and Military Lessons. (Washington: CSIS Press, 2003) 296. and the missile was also used during Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. The General Electric Company provides an Automatic Target Recognition Unit (ATRU) for the SLAM-ER that processes prelaunch and postlaunch targeting data, allows high speed video comparison (DSMAC), and enables the SLAM-ER to be used in a true \\"fire and forget\\" manner. It also includes a \\"man-in-the-loop\\" mode, where the pilot or weapons system officer can designate the point of impact precisely, even if the target has no distinguishing infrared signature. It can be launched and controlled by a variety of aircraft including the F/A-18 Hornet, F/A-18 Super Hornet, and P-3C Orion, as well as by the U.S. Air Force's F-15E Strike Eagle. Before the retirement of the S-3B Viking, it was also able to launch and control the SLAM-ER. The South Korean air force's version of the F-15E Strike Eagle, the F-15K Slam Eagle, has been capable of launching and controlling the SLAM-ER since 2006 in test exercises. In 2020, a proposal was put to congress to allow the sale of the SLAM-ER to Taiwan.

The album features remixes of earlier hits and previously unreleased material. Background Following his 1989 instrumental album New Green Clear Blue, Hartman returned to producing other artists and writing his own new material. Hartman started recording a new solo album of contemporary pop and dance music in the early 1990s and commented in 1993: \\"So many things have changed in terms of social and political issues, as well as the need for love and personal relationships. All of these things are the reasons why writing and recording new material is most meaningful to me.\\" Hartman died on March 22, 1994, from an AIDS-related brain tumor. A new compilation album, titled Keep the Fire Burnin', was then released later in the year. The album spawned two singles, both of which were new songs: \\"Keep the Fire Burnin'\\" and \\"The Love in Your Eyes\\". The title track features Loleatta Holloway, who Hartman had worked with before. As a single, the song reached No. 49 in the UK. \\"Living in America\\", written by Hartman and Charlie Midnight, was originally released by James Brown in 1985, who scored a big hit with the track. The version that appears here is Hartman's own previously unreleased version. The tracks one, four and nine have no remix credit in the titles. In an interview for Hartman's unofficial fan site, Midnight recalled: \\"I last saw Dan in the hospital in New York City. He was very optimistic and expected to go back into the studio to record more songs for a new album that eventually became, \\"Keep the Fire Burnin'.\\" Because I had moved to Los Angeles, we subsequently kept in touch by telephone.\\" Promotion In a February 1995 issue of The Advocate, an advert for the album was published with the statement: \\"Dan Hartman ruled the dance floors all over the world with classics like \\"Instant Replay,\\" \\"Relight My Fire,\\" and \\"I Can Dream About You\\". Now these and other boogie monsters come together on his new release, \\"Keep the Fire Burnin'.\\" Featuring the new single, \\"The Love in Your Eyes,\\" plus his own versions of his hit songs, \\"Free Ride\\" and \\"Living in America.\\" Some hits are forever.\\" Reception Upon release, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly commented: \\"Whether jumping aboard the '70s disco bandwagon or glomming on to '80s power pop, Dan Hartman was something of a hack chameleon. But this retrospective, Keep the Fire Burnin', makes its point: that his music was the worthy successor to KC's white-guy disco.\\" Greg Morago of The Courant wrote: \\"Hartman was preparing to reconquer the '90s dance floor with a pop-dance collection at the time of his death. From that effort, the title song, \\"Keep the Fire Burnin,\\" is Hartman at his best. Aggressive, bouncy and up-front, the track - with additional smokin' vocals by diva Loleatta Holloway of \\"Love Sensation\\" fame - proves he never lost his touch. He puts his own vocal stamp on \\"Living in America,\\" the pretty \\"I Can Dream About You\\" shimmers anew in a retake, as does \\"Instant Replay,\\" as close to disco perfection as possible. And \\"Free Ride\\" still takes us there. This sampling of Hartman's remarkably diverse career is a treat.\\" Steve Baltin of Cash Box commented: \\"This collection is a fitting tribute to Hartman. For those who know the music, but didn't know much about Hartman, this is a good introduction.\\"Cash Box magazine - January 21, 1995 - Pop Albums: Reviews - Steve Baltin - page 13 Anthony Violanti of The Buffalo News stated: \\"Dan Hartman doesn't waste time kicking out the jams on his new album. \\"Keep the Fire Burnin',\\" the opening track, is a scorching, gospel-style duet with Loleatta Holloway.\\" Tim Griggs of AllMusic noted: \\"This collection of hits and unreleased material by Dan Hartman is only so-so.

The alternative full name of the film is The Wall or psychoanalysis put to the test on autism. The film considers the question of whether psychoanalysis is a suitable treatment for autism. The film argues that while the rest of the world considers autism as a neurological disorder caused by anomalies in a specific area of the brain, in France concepts of the condition remain dominated by psychoanalysis, which sees autism as a form of psychosis caused by difficulties in subjective relationships and ultimately caused by the actions of the mother. The film relies on extensive interviews with 11 French psychoanalysts in order to tease out the details of their beliefs, which the film contrasts with the progress made by children who follow other, behavioural, approaches to improving autistic children's ability to communicate. The film argues that the psychoanalytic approach to autism is based on ignorance and misogyny and leads to harmful consequences for autistic children who fall under the care of psychoanalysts. The film ends with Robert asking the psychoanalysts what an autistic child can realistically expect to gain from a psychoanalytic therapy; the psychoanalysts interviewed are shown not to be able to answer this question coherently. Three of the psychoanalysts interviewed in the film sued Ms Robert.

Despite winning all nine of his reces, his career was largely overshadowed by that of his more celebrated stablemate Tudor Minstrel. He won all four of his races as a two-year-old in 1946 and all five in the following year including the Blue Riband Trial Stakes, Rous Memorial Stakes and Sussex Stakes. He was then retired to stud where he had limited success as a sire of winners. He died in 1967. Background Combat was a brown horse with a white coronet on his left hind leg bred by his owner John Arthur Dewar who inherited his Thoroughbred racehorses from his uncle, the Scottish whisky distiller Thomas Dewar, 1st Baron Dewar. These horses included Lady Juror, who became a successful broodmare, producing Fair Trial and the July Stakes winner Riot, the grand-dam of Combat. In the same year that Combat was foaled, Dewar bred Tudor Minstrel from another daughter of Lady Juror. Combat was from the first crop of foals sired by Big Game the best British colt of his generation whose wins included the 2000 Guineas and the Champion Stakes. Combat's dam Commotion won the Oaks Stakes in 1941 and became a successful broodmare: she also produced the St James's Palace Stakes winner Faux Tirage and the leading Argentinian sire Aristophanes. Dewar sent the colt into training with Fred Darling at Beckhampton in Wiltshire. Racing career =1946: two-year-old season= As a two-year-old in 1946 Combat ran four times and won on each occasion. At Royal Ascot in June he won the five furlong Windsor Castle Stakes. He also won the Champagne Stakes at Salisbury Racecourse. Darling and Dewar kept Combat away from his stable companion Tudor Minstrel. =1947: three-year-old season= As a three-year-old, Combat did not contest the classics: the stable relied on Tudor Minstrel who won the 2000 Guineas and was beaten when favourite for The Derby. In spring Combat won the Blue Riband Trial Stakes over eight and a half furlongs at Epsom Downs Racecourse, beating the future St Leger winner Sayajirao. In June he returned to Royal Ascot where he won the Rous Memorial Stakes over one mile. In July, after winning the Sandringham Stakes, he was sent to Goodwood Racecourse for the Sussex Stakes. Ridden by Gordon Richards he won at odds of 8/13 from Petition. Stud record Combat was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion.

She coached the St. Thomas the Apostle High School girls' basketball team to back- to-back undefeated seasons and league championships before being hired at Michigan. University of Michigan Borders was the second head coach of the Michigan Wolverines women's basketball team. She held that position from 1974 to 1977 and compiled a record of 23‚Äì28 (4‚Äì8 against Big Ten Conference opponents). The official colors of the Michigan women's basketball program, as with all other sports, are maize and blue. The Michigan Wolverines women's basketball program began in 1973. University of Michigan faculty member Vic Katch coached the team during its first season. Borders was hired in 1974 to take over as coach. In her first year as head coach, Borders had difficulty recruiting students to play on the team. Borders noted at the time: \\"Many didn't come out because the team wasn't a winner. They get frustrated when we work and work and still lose.\\" Borders' first team at Michigan had no returning seniors and no players above five feet, ten inches, and was made up of four freshwoman, three sophomores, and two juniors. Her 1974‚Äì1975 team played a 10-game schedule against other collegiate teams from the state of Michigan and one game against the University of Toledo. The team played its home games at Crisler Arena and did not charge for admission. The team lost its first six games, including a 67‚Äì29 loss to Western Michigan and a 54‚Äì36 loss to Michigan State.

She mostly wrote children's poems, and was the first famous African-American poet whose work was mostly in this area. She edited a column in The Crisis from 1925 until 1929, called \\"The Little Page\\", where she made drawings and wrote poetry for children and parables about being young and black in the 1920s. Newsome also illustrated for children's magazines and edited children's columns for Opportunity. She also wrote poems for adults, which were included in The Poetry of the Negro (1949). Her only volume of poetry was Gladiola Garden (1940). In addition to her writing, she worked as a librarian at an elementary school in Wilberforce, Ohio. She attended Wilberforce University, Oberlin College, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the University of Pennsylvania. Biography =Early life and education= Mary Effie Lee, better known as Effie Lee Newsome, was born on January 19, 1885, in Philadelphia, to parents Benjamin Franklin and Mary Elizabeth Ashe Lee. Newsome's father Benjamin was a Bishop and led the family from Texas to Ohio during Newsome's childhood. Effie would later receive her higher education from Wilberforce University (1901-1904), Oberlin College (1904-1905), the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts (1907-1908), and the University of Pennsylvania (1911-1914). =Adulthood= Starting in 1917, Effie Lee Newsome began working with W.E.B. Du Bois on The Crisis Magazine. Newsome would continue to contribute to a section of The Crisis known as The Little Page, until 1934. In 1920, Mary Effie Lee married Reverend Henry Nesby Newsome and thereafter was known as Effie Lee Newsome. After marriage, both Effie and Reverend Henry moved to Birmingham, Alabama, and later relocated to Wilberforce, Ohio. While in Ohio, Effie Lee Newsome worked as a librarian in an elementary school and continued to build her career as a writer during the Harlem Renaissance. Career Though Effie Lee Newsome was primarily known as a nature poet and a contributor to children's literature, her impression upon the people of the Harlem Renaissance was clear. Upon starting to write for The Crisis in 1917, and then in 1925, writing for her own section of the magazine known as The Little Page, Newsome was given a specific task. It was Newsome's job to teach the black youth of America that to be colored was to be beautiful. Such ideas were present in poems such as Newsome's To a Black Boy. Newsome was also expected to teach the black youth about their history as a people and how to turn the anger toward white America into love and compassion. Newsome's contribution to children's literature was aligned to some degree with that of W.E.B Du Bois, her editor in the early days of the NAACP. Their work together is an important part of Newsome's story, for it was Newsome's job to carry on within the pages of The Crisis Magazine (the NAACP monthly) what Du Bois had tried to achieve in his periodical for children, The Brownies' Book (also under NAACP auspices).

Geometrically regular schemes are defined in a similar way. In older terminology, points with regular local rings were called simple points, and points with geometrically regular local rings were called absolutely simple points. Over fields that are of characteristic 0, or algebraically closed, or more generally perfect, geometrically regular rings are the same as regular rings. Geometric regularity originated when Claude Chevalley and Andre Weil pointed out to that, over non-perfect fields, the Jacobian criterion for a simple point of an algebraic variety is not equivalent to the condition that the local ring is regular. A Noetherian local ring containing a field k is geometrically regular over k if and only if it is formally smooth over k. Examples gave the following two examples of local rings that are regular but not geometrically regular. #Suppose that k is a field of characteristic p > 0 and a is an element of k that is not a pth power. Then every point of the curve xp + yp = a is regular. However over the field k[a1/p], every point of the curve is singular. So the points of this curve are regular but not geometrically regular. #In the previous example, the equation defining the curve becomes reducible over a finite extension of the base field. This is not the real cause of the phenomenon: Chevalley pointed out to Zariski that the curve xp + y2 = a (with the notation of the previous example) is absolutely irreducible but still has a point that is regular but not geometrically regular.

It was worn for the first time at a gala dinner at the White House in November 1985. It is named after the American actor John Travolta, with whom the Princess danced at the dinner. Design Designed by London-born Victor Edelstein, the Travolta dress is an off-the-shoulder midnight blue velvet evening gown. It was inspired by Edwardian fashion, giving it a \\"slight sweep of costume drama\\". The journalist Jackie Modlinger described it as \\"dramatic in style\\" and \\"regal in fabric\\". History The Princess of Wales dancing with John Travolta at the White House, 9 November 1985 Edelstein recalls the Princess saw a burgundy version of the dress in his studio and requested it be made for her in midnight blue. The fittings for the gown took place in her private apartments at Kensington Palace. After the fitting, the Princess was so delighted with the final result she rushed to show it to Prince Charles. He reputedly told her she looked wonderful in the gown and that it would be perfect to wear with jewels. Diana visited the United States in early November 1985 with her husband Prince Charles. The couple stayed at the White House, where they attended a gala dinner on 11 November. On that occasion, the Princess of Wales wore Edelstein's dress. She was photographed dancing with the actor John Travolta to the music of his 1977 film Saturday Night Fever in the Entrance Hall. The photographs and TV footage of them \\"gliding around the room\\" were widely circulated around the world, and the gown came to be known as the \\"Travolta dress\\". The Princess of Wales wore the dress again in Germany in December 1987 and at the premiere of the film Wall Street in April 1988. She wore it for her last official portrait photograph, taken by Prince Charles's uncle, the Earl of Snowdon, in 1997. Auctions Shortly before her death in August 1997, Diana requested that the dress be sold in a charity auction. Florida-based businesswoman Maureen Dunkel bought it for ¬£100,000 in New York in June 1997, along with nine other dresses formerly owned by the Princess. The Travolta dress was the most expensive one sold at the auction. When she went bankrupt in 2011, Dunkel was forced to put them up for auction, but the Travolta dress was one of six that were not sold. It was finally auctioned off by Kerry Taylor in London on 19 March 2013, fetching ¬£240,000 ($362,424) and again being the most expensive auctioned dress. It was bought by \\"a British gentleman as a surprise to cheer up his wife\\". In 2019, it sold for ¬£264,000 ($325,317) to Historic Royal Palaces, a charity which looks after royal memorabilia including clothing and artifacts. The dress has joined the Royal Ceremonial Dress Collection and belongs to the palace. See also *Wedding dress of Lady Diana Spencer References Category:1985 clothing Category:1985 in Washington, D.C.

At its southern end the Deepwater Point Running Track continues another through Carneys Point to Deepwater. Route Once part of West Jersey and Seashore Railroad, Penns Grove Secondary parallels the Delaware River Located within Gloucester County and Salem County, the Penns Grove Secondary serves industries and distribution facilities in the corridor along the east bank of the Delaware River and with spur lines to Pureland Industrial Complex and maritime facilities, including the Port of Paulsboro, where rail interchange is provided by SMS Rail Lines. At the north, the line begins in Woodbury at a junction with the Salem Secondary and the Vineland Secondary. It then passes through Thorofare, West Deptford, Paulsboro, Gibbstown, Repaupo, Bridgeport, Pedricktown, and Penns Grove. For much of its length it travels parallel to US Route 130 and New Jersey Route 44. It bridges Mantua Creek, Repaupo Creek, White Sluice Race, Starrs Ditch, Raccoon Creek, and Oldmans Creek. Some of the bridges have been automated. South of Penns Grove, the Deepwater Point Industrial Track continues through Carneys Point to a DuPont industrial complex known as the Chamber Works at Deepwater in the vicinity of the vehicular Delaware Memorial Bridge. History The Delaware Shore Railroad was incorporated on February 20, 1873 to build a line from Woodbury to Penns Grove. The line was opened in July 1876, but declared bankruptcy in January 1879 and reincorporated as the Delaware River Railroad. On April 30, 1900, the WJ&S; acquired the DRR. On May 4, 1896 the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) consolidated all its railroads and several smaller properties in southern New Jersey into the West Jersey and Seashore Railroad (WJ&S;). Passenger service on the Penns Grove Branch ended July 8, 1950. Planned upgrades =Port of Paulsboro= A 2010 New Jersey Department of Transportation report anticipated increased freight activity in South Jersey. New infrastructure at the Port of Paulsboro, where SMS Rail Lines handles interchanges with Conrail Shared Assets Operations, includes the construction of a rail crossing, turnouts, and of track with a link to the Penns Grove Secondary and a balloon loop for dockside accessibility. It is expected to cost $3.2 million and be completed by 2014. Partial federal funding for this work was obtained in 2011 by South Jersey Port Corporation, Conrail, and Salem County by leveraging $117.65 million of infrastructure funding for the marine terminal and other South Jersey projects. =Jefferson Street Bridge= The Jefferson Street Bridge, or the Paulsboro Draw, is a railroad movable bridge over Mantua Creek upstream from its mouth.https://bridgehunter.com/nj/gloucester/paulsboro-railroad/ The \\"A-Frame\\", shear pole, swing bridge was originally constructed in 1917 and rebuilt in 1940. Once part of Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines (PRSL), it is now part of Conrail's Penns Grove Secondary. Originally manually opened, it was partially automated sometime between 2000 and 2003. Buckling of the bridge caused a derailment of a coal train in 2009. More than 15 rail cars left the tracks, though none toppled. In November 2012, seven cars derailed while crossing the bridge. Of the four cars that fell into the creek, one was punctured, releasing of highly toxic vinyl chloride, which required an evacuation in the region and Paulsboro school lock-downs. Removal of derailed cars and environmental cleanup was handled by U.S. Coast Guard. In March 2013, Conrail announced that the bridge would be replaced with an expected September 2014 operational date. Normally, between March 1 and November 30 the bridge is left in the open position for maritime traffic and closed when trains approach. It will remain locked in the closed position until the bridge is replaced.

The core of these points of view is to attach a mental state of mind with the sources of proper agricultural food sources in a balance of harmony in part because the sources have freshness and purity. Modern assertions are that the fresh foods contain vital micronutrients generally lost in most food processing. Additional issues are brought to light in modern times where advertising along with subtle cues in color or related sensory inputs are masking substandard or even toxic ingredients present. The masquerade of dyes and organic chemicals from non-food sources become key in the current vernacular of various publications and nutrition movements. History As a book The Philosophy of Eating was authored by Albert J. Bellows (1804-1869) in the late 1860s.Albert J. Bellows (1868) originated at the Harvard University Library, subsequently published by Hurd and Houghton 1867. The author portrayed the concepts in light of science as well as views drawn from religiosity common in the mid to late 1860s era. So with a biblical fervor as an original direction of inspiration the author then supplies a variety of what was then scientific knowledge to correctly apply that in agriculture to the table in the kitchen. Fresh fruits and grains as those so ordained in the work making up a core of inputs to the meats of the day looked upon in detail most up to that time obtained from the local butcher. More recent incarnations derived from this are exhibited in raw foodism for people. This manifestation seen in a variety of areas including vegan food preparation and offshoots related. Contemporary revisiting of this in a new updated book continuing is a more secular scientific work by George Davey who published a 2013 book called The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance.George Davey (2013) The Library of Congress, published by Corn Publishing 2013. With more up to date scientific analysis than the treatise from Bellows the author describes how mechanisms of discovery, chemical masks and the driving forces beyond that of the earlier works in the topic. Experiences Philosophy extends from the scientific observation to how we as people treat our animals versus ourselves in dietary habits from youth through to adulthood. Reviving the lost art of nourishing ourselves Carrien and Tamra (2006) 'Philosophy of Eating', the real food revolution 2006 blogged about in part to illustrate this as a proper approach. Though cited in The Philosophy of Eating Break the Trance, health philosophy of eating like our paleolithic ancestors is found in a variety directions including mineral intake. Contrast Processed foods get celebration along with trepidation in newer periodicals in 2013. Scientific American and Wired devote entire issues to food content and philosophy of nutrition.

She played college basketball at both Notre Dame and the University of Michigan. She holds the Michigan Wolverines women's basketball single-season record with 156 assists during the 1987-88 season. DeLong is currently the head coach of the girls' basketball team at Saginaw Heritage High School. She previously served as a coach at Saginaw's Arthur Hill High School and Saginaw Valley State University. She was inducted into the Saginaw Valley Sports Hall of Fame in 2011. Early years DeLong was raised in Carrollton, Michigan, and attended Carrollton High School from 1979 to 1982. She was thrice selected as an All- State player and led Carrollton to three Michigan Class C state championships. She scored over 1,000 points in her high school career and was selected as a third-team All-American as a senior. College basketball DeLong enrolled at the University of Notre Dame and played for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team as a freshman. At the start of her sophomore year, she felt she was not given an opportunity to perform. In January 1986, she transferred to the University of Michigan in the middle of the basketball season, citing a lack of chemistry with the Notre Dame coaching staff. DeLong, then known by her maiden name Vonnie Thompson, played two seasons at Michigan from 1986 to 1988. During her time at Michigan, she was five feet, seven inches tall. In her first year at Michigan, she led the team with 50 steals, averaged 36 minutes per game, and 7.3 points per game, and was named the team's co-MVP. During the 1986-87 season, she also broke Michigan's single- season record and led the Big Ten Conference with 147 assists.2012-13 Michigan Women's Basketball, p. 9. During the 1987-88 season, DeLong broke her own single-season record with 156 assists. Michigan head coach Bud VanDeWege called her a \\"gym rat,\\" which he described as \\"a player who likes to pick up a ball and play. It's someone who keeps playing during vacations or even after the season is over.\\" DeLong's annual assist totals still rank as the two highest single-season totals in program history. She also holds Michigan's single-game record with her total of 12 assists against Northeastern on December 5, 1987. Her two-year total of 303 assists ranks eighth on Michigan's list of career assist leaders.2012-13 Michigan Women's Basketball, p. 8. DeLong graduated from Michigan with a bachelor's degree in sports management and communications. Coaching career After graduating from Michigan, DeLong, then known as Vonnie Killmer, worked as a school teacher in the Saginaw area. She served as a basketball coach at Saginaw's Arthur Hill High School starting in 1993 and later also became the school's athletic director. In 1998, her team advanced to the state championship game. She compiled a 142-65 record in 10 seasons at Arthur Hill. In 2004, she was hired as the head coach of the women's basketball team at Saginaw Valley State University (SVSU). Her husband, Greg Killmer, died in a car crash in 2005 while she was travelling with the SVSU basketball team. She resigned as SVSU's head coach in March 2008, citing a desire to spend more time with her two daughters. In four years as the head coach at SVSU, she compiled a 35-72 record In 2010, DeLong was inducted into the Saginaw County Sports Hall of Fame. After five years away from coaching, DeLong was hired in 2013 as the girls' basketball coach at Saginaw Heritage High School. At the time, her daughters Kacy and Riley Killmer were students at Heritage. DeLong noted, \\"I actually did try to stay away . . . I tried hard. . . . But I did miss it. I miss the kids.

C. Brooks (September 19, 1886 - October 16, 1944), was a Georgia native who served as a Democrat from 1924 to 1932 in the Louisiana State Senate. Brooks represented the delta parishes: Tensas, Madison, East Carroll, and Concordia, a rich farming region along the Mississippi River in eastern Louisiana ranging from Vidalia to Tallulah to Lake Providence. At the time, two state senators served from the four-parish district. Background Brooks was born in Lexington in Oglethrope County in northeastern Georgia, to George Washington Brooks and the former Ida Stokes Briscoe. Brooks was given his middle name to honor U.S. President Grover Cleveland. Brooks graduated in 1908 from the University of Georgia at Athens, where he was active in athletic and fraternal activities. He had planned to study medicine but instead moved west for health reasons and sold real estate in Pauls Valley in Garvin County in southern Oklahoma. Thereafter, he was a cotton broker in Shreveport in far northwestern Louisiana.Henry E. Chambers, History of Louisiana, Vol. 2 (Chicago and New York City: The American Historical Society, Inc., 1925, p. 71) Political career In 1918, Brooks came to Tensas Parish, where two years later, he purchased the Botany Bay Plantation on Lake Bruin near the parish seat of government of St. Joseph. In the Senate, he was assigned to the Agriculture, Land, and Levees committees. Brooks was also the chairman of the Senate Public Parks and Public Buildings Committee He served alongside Norris C. Williamson of East Carroll Parish, an unwavering conservative and an unyielding critic of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr. Williamson retired to private life in 1932, rather than face likely defeat at the hands of the Longites, and his seat passed to Andrew L. Sevier of Tallulah.Once Proud Princes, p. 198 Brooks was unseated in his 1932 bid for a third Senate term by the banker Daniel B. Fleming of Ferriday in Concordia Parish. Himself generally anti-Long in the preceding term, Brooks equivocated regarding Longism and disappointed some of his original supporters who felt that he had not stood by his principles. Josiah Scott, editor of the Tensas Gazette, wrote that Brooks had \\"a way of 'standing in' with both sides .... keeping posted on all that goes on in the camp of his friends and in the camp of his enemies alike.\\" Scott noted that Brooks had found ways to get policies and programs supported in the delta, such as bridge work, approved despite the general hostility of the Long administration. In December 1931, Brooks appeared at a Long rally in Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish on behalf of Long's chosen successor as governor, O. K. Allen. Brooks endorsed Allen for governor and promised if retained in the Senate to support the Long-Allen agenda over the next four years. Brooks, however, was caught between pro-Long sentiment in the lower delta which coalesced behind Fleming and the conservative planter candidate, Andrew Sevier, in the upper delta. Two seats were at stake; Fleming and Sevier prevailed, with Brooks cast aside for reelection. Emerging pro-Long voters in Brooks' own Tensas Parish even turned to Fleming.Once Proud Princes, pp. 207-209 Personal life Brooks was affiliated with the Knights of Pythias. In 1915, he married the former Linda Mae Sibley (1890-1976), a native of Bossier Parish, who was residing with her parents in Shreveport. Linda took an active role in civic matters and founded the first Girl Scout troop in St. Joseph. Four years after Brooks' death, Linda married Dr. George Watts Dubuisson, who died in 1952. She continued to operate Botany Bay Plantation after the deaths of both husbands. She died at the since defunct St. Charles Legion Memorial Hospital in Newellton. Both Dubuissons are interred at Legion Memorial Cemetery in Newellton; Clifford Brooks' burial place is unknown. See also Related names in Tensas Parish agriculture: *Daniel F. Ashford *Elliot D.

A distinction is sometimes made between a flowline and a pipeline.Bai & Bai, p. 22 The former is an intrafield pipeline, in the sense that it is used to connect subsea wellheads, manifolds and the platform within a particular development field. The latter, sometimes referred to as an export pipeline, is used to bring the resource to shore. Sizeable pipeline construction projects need to take into account many factors, such as the offshore ecology, geohazards and environmental loading ‚Äì they are often undertaken by multidisciplinary, international teams. Example of a submarine pipeline route: the Langeled pipeline. Route selection One of the earliest and most critical tasks in a submarine pipeline planning exercise is the route selection.Palmer & King, p. 11-13 This selection has to consider a variety of issues, some of a political nature, but most others dealing with geohazards, physical factors along the prospective route, and other uses of the seabed in the area considered.Dean, p. 342-343 This task begins with a fact-finding exercise, which is a standard desk study that includes a survey of geological maps, bathymetry, fishing charts, aerial and satellite photography, as well as information from navigation authorities. =Physical factors= Interaction between a submarine pipeline and the seabed onto which it rests (four possible scenarios). The primary physical factor to be considered in submarine pipeline construction is the state of the seabed ‚Äì whether it is smooth (i.e., relatively flat) or uneven (corrugated, with high points and low points). If it is uneven, the pipeline will include free spans when it connects two high points, leaving the section in between unsupported.Palmer &King;, p. 13‚Äì16 If an unsupported section is too long, the bending stress exerted onto it (due to its weight) may be excessive. Vibration from current-induced vortexes may also become an issue.Dean, Sect. 7.2.2 Corrective measures for unsupported pipeline spans include seabed leveling and post-installation support, such as berm or sand infilling below the pipeline. The strength of the seabed is another significant parameter. If the soil is not strong enough, the pipeline may sink into it to an extent where inspection, maintenance procedures and prospective tie-ins become difficult to carry out. At the other extreme, a rocky seabed is expensive to trench and, at high points, abrasion and damage of the pipeline's external coating may occur. Ideally, the soil should be such as to allow the pipe to settle into it to some extent, thereby providing it with some lateral stability. gouging action of drifting ice features, such as icebergs. Other physical factors to be taken into account prior to building a pipeline include the following:Palmer & Been, p. 182‚Äì187Croasdale et al. 2013 * Seabed mobility: Sand waves and megaripples are features that move with time, such that a pipeline that was supported by the crest of one such feature during construction may find itself in a trough later during the pipeline's operational lifespan. The evolution of these features is difficult to predict so it is preferable to avoid the areas where they are known to exist. * Submarine landslides: They result from high sedimentation rates and occur on steeper slopes. They can be triggered by earthquakes. When the soil around the pipe is subjected to a slide, especially if the resulting displacement is at high angle to the line, the pipe within it can incur severe bending and consequent tensile failure. * Currents: High currents are objectionable in that they hinder pipe laying operations. For instance, in shallow seas tidal currents may be quite strong in a strait between two islands. Under these circumstances, it may be preferable to bring the pipe elsewhere, even if this alternative route ends up being longer. * Waves: In shallow waters, waves can also be problematic for pipeline laying operations (in severe wave regimes) and, subsequently, to its stability, because of the water's scouring action. This is one of a number of reasons why landfalls (where the pipeline reaches the shoreline) are particularly delicate areas to plan. * Ice-related issues: In freezing waters, floating ice features often drift into shallower waters, and their keel comes into contact with the seabed. As they continue to drift, they gouge the seabed and can hit the pipeline.Barrette 2011 Stamukhi can also damage this structure, either by exerting high local stresses on it or by causing to soil around it to fail, thereby inducing excessive bending. Strudel are another pipeline hazard in cold waters ‚Äì water gushing through them can remove the soil from below the structure, making it vulnerable to overstress (due to self-weight) or vortex-induced oscillations. Pipeline route planning for areas where these risks are known to exist has to consider laying the pipeline in a back-filled trench. =Other uses of the seabed= Proper planning of a pipeline route has to factor in a wide range of human activities that make use of the seabed along the proposed route, or that are likely to do so in the future. They include the following:Palmer & King, p. 16-18 *Other pipelines: If and where the proposed pipeline intersects an existing one, which is not uncommon, a bridging structure may be required at that juncture in order to cross it. This has to be done at a right angle. The juncture should be carefully designed so as to avoid interferences between the two structures either by direct physical contact or due to hydrodynamic effects. *Fishing vessels: Commercial fishing makes use of heavy fishing nets dragged on the seabed and extending several kilometers behind the trawler. This net could snag the pipeline, with potential damage to both pipeline and vessel. *Ship anchors: Ship anchors are a potential threat to pipelines, especially near harbors. *Military activities: Some areas still have mines originating from former conflicts but that are still operational. Other areas, used for bombing or gunning practices, may also conceal live ammunition. Moreover, at some locations, various types of instrumentation are laid on the seafloor for submarine detection. These areas have to be avoided. Submarine pipeline characteristics Submarine pipelines generally vary in diameter from for gas lines, to for high capacity lines. Wall thicknesses typically range from to . The pipe can be designed for fluids at high temperature and pressure. The walls are made from high-yield strength steel, 350-500 MPa (50,000-70,000 psi), weldability being one of the main selection criteria. The structure is often shielded against external corrosion by coatings such as bitumastic or epoxy, supplemented by cathodic protection with sacrificial anodes.Ramakrishnan, p. 185 Concrete or fiberglass wrapping provides further protection against abrasion. The addition of a concrete coating is also useful to compensate for the pipeline's negative buoyancy when it carries lower density substances.Ramakrishnan, p. 186 The pipeline's inside wall is not coated for petroleum service. But when it carries seawater or corrosive substances, it can be coated with epoxy, polyurethane or polyethylene; it can also be cement-lined. In the petroleum industry, where leaks are unacceptable and the pipelines are subject to internal pressures typically in the order of 10 MPa (1500 psi), the segments are joined by full penetration welds. Mechanical joints are also used. A pig is a standard device in pipeline transport, be it on-land or offshore. It is used to test for hydrostatic pressure, to check for dents and crimps on the sidewalls inside the pipe, and to conduct periodic cleaning and minor repairs.  Pipeline construction  Pipeline construction involves two procedures: assembling many pipe segments into a full line, and installing that line along the desired route. Several systems can be used ‚Äì for a submarine pipeline, the choice in favor of any one of them is based on the following factors: physical and environmental conditions (e.g. currents, wave regime), availability of equipment and costs, water depth, pipeline length and diameter, constraints tied to the presence of other lines and structures along the route. These systems are generally divided into four broad categories: pull/tow, S-lay, J-lay and reel-lay.Dean, p.347-350Palmer & King, Chap.12Bai & Bai, p. 910-912Wilson, Chap.1 Simplified drawings showing three configurations used to tow subsea pipelines offshore to the planned installation site (not to scale). =The pull/tow system= In the pull/tow system, the submarine pipeline is assembled onshore and then towed to location. Assembly is done either parallel or perpendicular to the shoreline ‚Äì in the former case, the full line can be built prior to tow out and installation.Brown, p. 1 A significant advantage with the pull/tow system is that pre-testing and inspection of the line are done onshore, not at sea.Brown, p. 1 It allows to handle lines of any size and complexity.Bai & Bai, p. 910-912 As for the towing procedures, a number of configurations can be used, which may be categorized as follows: surface tow, near-surface tow, mid-depth tow and off-bottom tow.Palmer & King, 12.4 *Surface tow: In this configuration, the pipeline remains at the surface of the water during tow, and is then sunk into position at lay site. The line has to be buoyant ‚Äì this can be done with individual buoyancy units attached to it.Brown, p. 1 Surface tows are not appropriate for rough seas and are vulnerable to lateral currents. *Near-surface tow: The pipeline remains below the water surface but close to it ‚Äì this mitigates wave action. But the spar buoys used to maintain the line at that level are affected by rough seas, which in itself may represent a challenge for the towing operation. *Mid-depth tow: The pipeline is not buoyant ‚Äì either because it is heavy or it is weighted down by hanging chains. In this configuration, the line is suspended in a catenary between two towing vessels. The shape of that catenary (the sag) is a balance between the line's weight, the tension applied to it by the vessels and hydrodynamic lift on the chains.Palmer & King, p. 415 The amount of allowable sag is limited by how far down the seabed is. *Off-bottom tow: This configuration is similar to the mid-depth tow, but here the line is maintained within 1 to 2 m (several feet) away from the bottom, using chains dragging on the seabed. *Bottom tow: In this case, the pipeline is dragged onto the bottom ‚Äì the line is not affected by waves and currents, and if the sea gets too rough for the tow vessel, the line can simply be abandoned and recovered later. Challenges with this type of system include: requirement for an abrasion-resistant coating, interaction with other submarine pipelines and potential obstructions (reef, boulders, etc.). Bottom tow is commonly used for river crossings and crossings between shores.Palmer & King, p. 417 Simplified drawings of three common systems used for the construction and installation of subsea pipelines (not to scale): S-lay, J-lay and reel. Solitaire, one of the largest pipe-laying ships in the world. The DCV Aegir, a pipelay vessel designed for J-lay and reel- lay. The Saipem 7000, a semi-submersible crane vessel equipped with a J-lay pipe-laying system. =The S-lay system= In the S-lay system, the pipeline assembly is done at the installation site, on board a vessel that has all the equipment required for joining the pipe segments: pipe handling conveyors, welding stations, X-ray equipment, joint-coating module, etc.Gerwick,15.2 The S notation refers to the shape of the pipeline as it is laid onto the seabed. The pipeline leaves the vessel at the stern or bow from a supporting structure called a stinger that guides the pipe's downward motion and controls the convex-upward curve (the overbend). As it continues toward the seabed, the pipe has a convex-downward curve (the sagbend) before coming into contact with the seabed (touch down point). The sagbend is controlled by a tension applied from the vessel (via tensioners) in response to the pipeline's submerged weight. The pipeline configuration is monitored so that it will not get damaged by excessive bending.Gerwick,15.2 This on-site pipeline assembly approach, referred to as lay-barge construction, is known for its versatility and self-contained nature ‚Äì despite the high costs associated with this vessel's deployment, it is efficient and requires relatively little external support.Palmer & King, p. 395 But it may have to contend with severe sea states ‚Äì these adversely affect operations such as pipe transfer from supply boats, anchor-handling and pipe welding. Recent developments in lay-barge design include dynamic positioning and the J-lay system.Palmer & King, p. 397 =The J-lay system= In areas where the water is very deep, the S-lay system may not be appropriate because the pipeline leaves the stinger to go almost straight down. To avoid sharp bending at the end of it and to mitigate excessive sag bending, the tension in the pipeline would have to be high.Palmer & King, p. 401 Doing so would interfere with the vessel's positioning, and the tensioner could damage the pipeline. A particularly long stinger could be used, but this is also objectionable since that structure would be adversely affected by winds and currents. The J-lay system, one of the latest generations of lay-barge, is better suited for deep water environments. In this system, the pipeline leaves the vessel on a nearly vertical ramp (or tower). There is no overbend ‚Äì only a sagbend of catenary nature (hence the J notation), such that the tension can be reduced. The pipeline is also less exposed to wave action as it enters the water.Palmer & King, p. 402 However, unlike for the S-lay system, where pipe welding can be done simultaneously at several locations along the vessel deck's length, the J-lay system can only accommodate one welding station. Advanced methods of automatic welding are used to compensate for this drawback.Gerwick, p. 615 =The Reel-lay system= In the reel-lay system, the pipeline is assembled onshore and is spooled onto a large drum typically about x in size,Bai & Bai, p. 145 mounted on board a purpose-built vessel. The vessel then goes out to location to lay the pipeline. Onshore facilities to assemble the pipeline have inherent advantages: they are not affected by the weather or the sea state and are less expensive than seaborne operations.Palmer & King, p. 412 Pipeline supply can be coordinated: while one line is being laid at sea, another one can be spooled onshore.Gerwick, p. 611 A single reel can have enough capacity for a full length flow line. The reel-lay system, however, can only handle lower diameter pipelines ‚Äì up to about 400 mm (16 in).Bai & Bai, p. 144 Also, the kind of steel making up the pipes must be able to undergo the required amount of plastic deformation as it is bent to proper curvature (by a spiral J-tube) when reeled around the drum, and straightened back (by a straightener) during the layout operations at the installation site.Gerwick, p. 610 Stabilisation Several methods are used to stabilise and protect submarine pipelines and their components. These may be used alone or in combinations. = Trenching and burial = Simplified drawing showing a typical jetting system for trenching below a submarine pipeline that is lying on the seafloor. A submarine pipeline may be laid inside a trench as a means of safeguarding it against fishing gear (e.g. anchors) and trawling activity.Palmer & King, sect. 12.5.1Ramakrishnan, p. 212 This may also be required in shore approaches to protect the pipeline against currents and wave action (as it crosses the surf zone). Trenching can be done prior to pipeline lay (pre-lay trenching), or afterward by seabed removal from below the pipeline (post-lay trenching). In the latter case, the trenching device rides on top of, or straddles, the pipeline. Several systems are used to dig trenches in the seabed for submarine pipelines: *Jetting: This is a post-lay trenching procedure whereby the soil is removed from beneath the pipeline by using powerful pumps to blow water on each side of it.Palmer & King, p. 420Ramakrishnan, p. 214 *Mechanical cutting: This system uses chains or cutter disks to dig through and remove harder soils, including boulders,Palmer & King, p. 421 from below the pipeline. *Plowing: The plowing principle, which was initially used for pre-lay trenching, has evolved into sophisticated systems that are lighter in size for faster and safer operation. *Dredging/excavation: In shallower water, the soil can be removed with a dredger or an excavator prior to laying the pipeline. This can be done in a number of ways, notably with a ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤cutter-suction‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ system, with the use of buckets or with a backhoe. ‚Ä≥A buried pipe is far better protected than a pipe in an open trench.‚Ä≥Palmer & King, p. 424 This is commonly done either by covering the structure with rocks quarried from a nearby shoreline. Alternatively, the soil excavated from the seabed during trenching can be used as backfill. A significant drawback to burial is the difficulty in locating a leak should it arise, and for the ensuing repairing operations.Palmer & King, p. 425 =Mattresses= Concrete mattresses on barge Mattresses may be laid over the pipeline, or both under and over it depending on the substrate. *Frond mattresses have an effect similar to seaweed and tend to cause sand to accumulate. They must be anchored to the bottom to prevent being washed away. *Concrete mattresses are used to help hold part of the pipeline in place by their weight and reduce scour. They are usually heavy enough to be held in place by their own weight, as they are made from concrete blocks linked together by rope. *Combination mattresses of concrete mattress with overlaid frond mattress are also used. =Ground anchors= Clamps holding the pipeline to piles may be used to prevent lateral movement. =Saddle blocks= Precast concrete saddle blocks may be used to provide lateral support and hold the pipeline down more firmly. =Sandbags and groutbags= These may be packed at the sides or under a pipeline to provide vertical and/or lateral support. =Gravel dumps= Gravel may be dumped over parts of a pipeline to reduce scour and help stabilise against lateral movement. Environmental and Legal issues The Espoo Convention created certain requirements for notification and consultation where a project is likely to have transboundary environmental effects. Scholars are divided on how effective Espoo is at mitigating environmental harm. Law of the Sea concepts involved in the construction of transboundary pipelines concern territorial waters, continental shelves, exclusive economic zones, freedom of the high seas and protection of the environment. Under international law the high seas are open to all states to law underwater pipelines and for various other types of construction. Underwater pipelines pose environmental risk because pipelines themselves may become damaged by ship's anchors, corrosion, tectonic activity, or as a result of defective construction and materials. Stanislav Patin has said that study on the effects of natural gas on underwater ecosystems, fish and other marine organisms has been limited. Researchers found a cause-effect relationship between mass fish mortality and natural gas leaks after drilling accidents in the Sea of Azov in 1982 and 1985. Concerns about the environmental risks of underwater pipelines have been raised on numerous occasions. There have been at least two serious incidents involving oil pipelines on the UK's continental shelf. There have also been several \\"minor spills and gas leaks\\" involving other North Sea pipelines. In 1980 a pipeline was damaged by a ship's anchor and in 1986 a pipeline valve failed due to pressure changed. Both incidents resulted in oil spills. Several Baltic countries expressed concerns about the Nord Stream pipeline. The route of the 1,200 km underwater pipeline would travel through fishing areas of the Baltic Sea, as well as area where chemical weapons from World War II had been discarded.

In Saint Petersburg, she, as well as a couple of other Finnish females, were given some military training. In 1713, she was re-baptized in the Russian orthodox faith as Uliana. She was given a dragoon uniform and, alongside other Finnish women with a similar history, she was ordered to Finland to assist the Russian army in its conquest of Swedish Finland.

She was a highly educated and active member of the Catholic Church. She is best known as the sister of M√©tis leader Louis Riel. Born in 1848 in the Red River settlement to parents Jean-Louis Riel and Julie (Lagimodi√®re) Riel, as a young child she was surrounded by the word of God, being educated by Sisters of Charity of Montreal but also by her mother, who was dedicated to the Christian faith. She was inspired to become a nun after her brother Louis Riel entered the seminary to become a priest. Although Louis did not become a priest, Sara actively took her Solemn vows in 1868. She taught languages and arts at the Grey Nuns boarding schools between 1868 and 1871, after which she became a Catholic missionary. Her family were active members in the Red River community right up to the M√©tis resistance. Although separated from her family, her writings showed a sympathetic view on the eve of the resistance. Given that her brother was an active member in leading the revolution against the government, in 1869 the congregation feared for her safety and she was moved several times within a few years. Even though she took no active part in the cause, she provided support to her brother and a voice to the M√©tis of the local Catholic Churches. In 1871 she became the first M√©tis missionary from Red River and set off for √éle-√†-la-Crosse in northern Saskatchewan. In 1872 Sara Riel was taken ill and almost died, after a vision from God, Sara Riel changed her name to ‚ÄòSister Marguerite-Marie of Alacoque‚Äô and re-honored her vows and commitment to the Catholic Church. Sara actively wrote to her family telling them of her experiences, wishes, and hopes for them. She died of tuberculosis in 1884 at the age of 35.  Family  Sara Riel was born on October 11, 1848 in Red River, a small community settled originally through the fur trade and later expanded by the colonization of Lord Selkirk. Red River was a secluded place in the 1850s. It could only be reached by water, leaving it almost impossible to reach in the winter. The North West Company's fur trade was the primary economic resource of the region. There were large alliances formed between the trader and the indigenous people. They taught each other important aspect of survival and adaptation with the buffalo hunt, agriculture, and medicine. Red River eventually became a place where retired fur traders could live with their families. The new culture created in the settlement produced a generation of half settlers, half indigenous children known as the M√©tis, who created their own unique culture. Sara Riel's father was Jean-Louis Riel born in 1817, he was a voyageur for the North West Company. He was the 5th generation settler. His background was that of a French-Canadian. In Red River, Jean-Louis Riel became a very important person within the growing M√©tis community. Jean-Louis Riel taught his children to be proud of their M√©tis heritage and to embrace their culture. He himself led many M√©tis revolts, including the one surrounding the Sayer Trial in 1849. Sara and Louis Riel's mother, Julie (Lagimodi√®re) Riel was born in 1822 in French River. She was also from a French background that integrated with the M√©tis culture and passed on their traditions to their children. Prior to marriage, Julie Lagimodi√®re was planning to join the Grey Nuns. Her parents chose the marriage to Jean-Louis Riel as a sense of financial and social security for their loving daughter. Sara Riel was the fourth child born to Jean-Louis and Julie Riel. The first born was Louis, followed by two children who did not make it past birth. Sara was the next child born. This dynamic left a special bond between Louis and Sara as the two eldest children of the family. Altogether the Riel family consisted of 11 children but only 8 lived to adulthood. The Riel family were members of the Red River elite and the children lived a more privileged life, very close to the Catholic Church, receiving the best education Red River had to offer. From the mid1840's till the late 1880s, the family went through hard economic times and had to sacrifice their prior way of living. Education was important to the Riel family and was taken very seriously by Julie Riel, whom herself wanted to join the sisterhood prior to marriage. She taught her children the ways of the Catholic Church and to love God in their actions.  Education  Grey Nuns' Convent in 1858 Sara Riel was educated by the Sisters of Charity boarding school in St. Boniface. She excelled in many subjects including languages, art, and music. But she also learned household skills such as cooking and cleaning along with spin, knit, sewing, and embroidering. The Grey Nuns believed that orderliness and cleanliness of M√©tis were a representation of the schooling provided by the Church, therefore they encouraged the young girls to perfect their skills in household chores. She attended school in St. Boniface from 1858 until 1866 when she was chosen to join the Grey Nuns. She entered the congregation in 1866. In 1868 she became the first M√©tis Grey Nun from Red River. She was skilled in many languages including French, English, Michif, and Cree. The church saw her as ideal to become a teacher but also a mediator between; the missionaries and the aboriginal people. Also between the aboriginal woman, the church, and the Hudson Bay Company. After the death of her father in 1864, Louis became the head of the family and therefore responsible for his mother and younger siblings including Sara Riel. He and the rest of the children were forced to quit school to help with agriculture and sustaining the family home. Sara Riel was the only one who was allowed to stay in school and fulfill her mission as a nun.  Religion  The Riel family was very dedicated to the education of their children. Their mother was especially dedicated to the church and instilled the will of God into her children. The family found themselves very close to Alexandre-Antonin Tach√© who was the head of the Catholic church in St. Boniface. It was through him that Sara Riel learned of the missionaries and Louis Riel was chosen to study for the priesthood. Louis Riel left school in 1865, abandoning all wishes to join the church. He did not return home from Montreal until after his father's death. Following in her loving brother's footsteps Sara Riel was accepted to the Grey Nuns as a novice in 1866. Two years later in 1868, Sara Riel took her vows and joined the Catholic community. At this time, Red River had just 26 sisters serving as missionaries. Many of which came from Quebec, who helped provide a better education for the country born children and M√©tis. On June 22, 1871, Sister Riel left for the mission of Ile-a-La-Crosse now in northern Saskatchewan. Le M√©tis (a local Red River newspaper) reported: ‚ÄúSister Riel, Sister of Mr. Louis Riel, however, had been designated to accompany her (Sister Charlebois), she is believed the first missionary from the M√©tis nation of Red River, given to this Great Apostolic work, and one could not find a more dignified person. a kind heart, keen intelligence, and inexhaustible charity distinguished this new missionary, her departure is a sacrifice for her family and the entire population, but at the same time it is an honor and a blessing for us‚Äù.  The M√©tis Resistance 1869-1870  The first M√©tis resistance happened between 1869-1870. This happened following the establishment of the Canadian government and first signs of surveyors on the M√©tis land. The Hudson Bay Company sold Rupert's Land to the Canadian Government without thinking about the people who occupied it or had claims over it. Louis Riel and the other M√©tis believed that the creation of the Canadian state was not only a political issue but also a religious and cultural one. With determination to preserve their way of life the M√©tis people took arms. After stopping surveyors, the M√©tis of Red River formed a provisional government. At the head of the provisional government was Louis Riel. During the conflict, the M√©tis took Fort Gary and executed Thomas Scott. This forced the Canadian government to acknowledge the people who lived on the land. This uprising created the province known as Manitoba. With Sara and Louis Riel's close relationship and tensions rising between the M√©tis and the government, the congregation had to take special precaution with Sara Riel. By 1869 the congregation feared for Sister Riel's safety. With the rebellion unfolding, she was moved back to St. Boniface. Sara Riel was not impressed by the choice to move her. When Sara learned that she would have to perform manual and domestic duties, she saw that as a demotion to all the hard work she had done. Sister Riel wrote in one of her letters: ‚ÄúThe annual autumn changes took place today on the 20th. my mission to St. Norber is over. The order placed me in the day school. I must also mend and was the community linen-- a job that occupies me continuously without fatigues‚Äù With all the stress and chaos that the rebellion brought at home, Sister Riel still wrote actively to her brother. In the many letters sent, Sara Riel repeatedly told her brother to stay strong and fight for what they both believed in. In September 1868, she wrote: ‚ÄúLouis, chase away the sad and troubling thoughts to which our last meeting gave birth. Which time and the grace of God, the darkness of the present will disappear. Be confident! until then, we must do out duties. You as a fervent Christian and me as a sister of charity‚Äù When Louis Riel was in exile to Saint-Joseph, Detroit after the first uprising, Sara Riel wrote several letters to Louis showing confidence, love and vital information that may have played a role in the future of the cause. She wrote; ‚Äútruthfully I believe it would be an insult to God if I doubted for only a second the complete success of our cause ... remember last winter when everything seemed over. It was God‚Äôs will that you should be overthrown, it overthrew in order to better your success‚Äù In another letter she sent she described the heartache felt by the M√©tis following his departure. She wrote: Louis let us bury our sorrows in the wounds of his (God) sacred heart...to love and pray, these are the arms with which we must fight to vanquish the conqueror. Throughout the exile, Sister Riel and Mgr Tach√© knew of Louis Riel's whereabouts and even helped him with news and information of Canadian politics. This is about the same time that Sara Riel chose to exile herself. But like the letters to Louis Riel, they both had to wait until the time was right. This was a hard time for Sara Riel, she prayed for her brother's health and safety. Following the resistance, the people of Red River elected Louis Riel to a seat in Parliament in 1873 but he was a wanted man in Canada. The Canadian Government wanted him for the murder of Scott, which prevented him from taking his seat and delayed his return to Red River. The last M√©tis resistance occurred in 1885, one year after the death of Sara Riel.  Life after the Resistance  Sara Riel was often mentioned in the writings and correspondence of the Grey Nuns. She was a very active, important and hardworking member of the clergy, who was often recognized for her actions. In 1872 Sister Riel was taken ill and almost died one day after choir practice. After a miraculous recovery, she claimed to have been saved by God and her faith was solidified. She changed her name to that of a great saint: ‚ÄúMarguerite-Marie of Alacoque‚Äù after a vision from God. In the 1880s her health began to decline. Sara Riel suffered from tuberculosis for many years. When her health became very serious she was given permission to return to Red River, to be with her family in her final days. Sister Riel refused the offer. She was determined that her mission was to √éle-√†-la-Cross and would stay until the end. Sara Riel died December 27, 1883 at the age of 35. She served the Catholic Church as a Nun for just over 17 years, either as a teacher, a translator or a missionary. The chronicles from √éle-√†-la-Cross described her last moments as ones of suffering and difficulties. One of her final letters was addressed to her brother, Louis Riel. She claimed her love for him, she reminded him to be strong and to remain dedicated to God in all his actions. On April 27, 1885, the day after the Green Lake Post was looted during the North-West Rebellion, the Grey Nuns of √éle-√†-la-Crosse were terrified that Louis Riel, who had accused them of letting his younger sister die in misery would seek revenge. They fled the village along with most of the personnel and dependents of the Hudson's Bay Company Post and the Roman Catholic Mission. The large group camped on a small wooded island north of Patuanak until the crisis was over and returned to √éle-√†-la-Crosse on May 29, 1885.  Legacy  Today, Sara Riel is not talked about as much as her brother. The Riel family home still stands in Red River and has become a historical site in the province of Manitoba. It is referred to as the birthplace of the M√©tis resistance. Sara Riel is seen as an important figure in the history of the M√©tis woman, of Red River and in the Catholic Missionary. She was an active writer which left a larger paper trail allowing historians and scholars an insight into her life, family and the people at the time of the resistance. Although in the 1970s Sara was looked at in a more negative way, she was declared a pale representation of her brother her letters left important information in Canadian history, allowing an alternate view into many aspects of life of the 1800s.

His work is often associated with Na√Øve art but has influences from Neorealism, Post- and Neo-impressionism and Dutch Golden Age painting. Early life Rimbert was born in Paris. His father was a gilder and picture framer. He grew up in the Montparnasse - Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s district of Paris. As a child and teenager he was involved in music, drawing and painting and reading. His father encouraged him to enter the French Postal administration. The young postal clerk continued to pursue his artistic interests until World War I, when he was enlisted and joined the general military staff, first as a telegraph operator and then as a draughtsman. When the war ended he went back to the Postal Administration, got married and started his two-track career as a postal officer and an artist. Creative Life Rimbert's career as a painter began in 1920. From 1932 until 1944 his painting was interrupted, first by illness and later by World War II. He then continued to paint until 1983. In addition to numerous drawings, unfinished or destroyed paintings, his work consists of 276 recorded paintings, mainly oil on canvas, which are now in the possession of private collectors and museums in France and in other countries. Rimbert's paintings were influenced by the Dutch classic master painters, by the French 18th-century painter Jean-Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin, and by Henri Rousseau (Le Douanier Rousseau), who was starting to be recognized at the time when Rimbert began painting. One of Rimbert's early works, \\"Le douanier Rousseau heading for glory and prosperity\\" is dedicated to Rousseau. Rimbert's friend, French painter Marcel Gromaire, convinced him to exhibit some of his early works. Two years later he met the poet and painter Max Jacob, who introduced Rimbert to well-known artists, including Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Amedeo Modigliani. The ongoing exchanges of letters between these two men have been published. He also met the art critic Anatole Jakovsky, who gave Rimbert's paintings the label of \\"na√Øve Art\\". Rimbert's earliest paintings are mainly still lifes, but soon he began to paint representations of quaint buildings and street scenes in his native Paris, its suburbs and in provincial towns as well as landscapes. The village and surrounding countryside of Perpezac-le-Noir, near Brive-La-Gaillarde in southwestern France, where his wife's family came from and where she owned a house, is also often represented. His later works reflect his visits during winter on the C√¥te d'Azur and often depict Mediterranean street scenes and landscapes. Exhibitions Rimbert exhibited at the Salon des Ind√©pendants, the salon des surind√©pendants, the Salon d'Automne, the salon \\"Comparaisons\\" as well as at numerous group shows in France, and in other countries, of \\"Ma√Ætres populaires\\", \\"Peintres na√Øfs\\", or \\"Primitifs‚Äù. Rimbert also had nine solo exhibitions in Paris between 1927 and 1987, as well as a posthumous exhibition in 1996. In 2007 a major exhibition of his works was held at the Mus√©e International d'Art Na√Øf Anatole Jakovsky, in Nice, establishing a parallel between Rimbert and Marcel Gromaire.

The hospital was regarded as one of Nevada's best, and it included modern tools such as an X-ray machine, a rarity in small town hospitals at the time. While Hawkins anticipated that Douglas County would need a modern hospital for its growing population, the county's population actually fell at the 1920 census, and the community struggled to keep its hospital open. Hawkins sold the hospital in 1918, and it closed in 1924. The building was used for housing until 1958, when it was vacated.

He served as consul in Aleppo when the city was the junction of many important deportation routes. Jackson concluded that the policies towards the Armenians were \\"without doubt a carefully planned scheme to thoroughly extinguish the Armenian race.\\" He considered the \\"wartime anti-Armenian measures\\" to be a \\"gigantic plundering scheme as well as a final blow to extinguish the race.\\" By September 15, 1915, Jackson estimated that a million Armenians had been killed and deemed his own survival a \\"miracle\\". After the Armenian Genocide, Jackson led a relief effort and was credited with saving the lives of \\"thousands of Armenians.\\" After serving as consul in Aleppo, Jackson served in Italy and Canada. He was awarded numerous medals, including the Order of Merit of Lebanon. He died on December 4, 1947, at the age of 76.  Early life  Jesse Benjamin Jackson was born in Paulding, Ohio, on November 19, 1871, to Andrew Carl Jackson and Lucy Ann (Brown) Jackson. Jackson attended the local Paulding public schools and eventually served as a quartermaster sergeant in the U.S. Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Jackson enrolled as a clerk of the House of Representatives from 1900 to 1901 and later was employed in the insurance and real estate business. Jackson was later appointed as the American consul at Alexandretta (ƒ∞skenderun) on March 15, 1905. This position lasted until 1908 when he became the U.S. consul at Aleppo.  Armenian Genocide  As early as November 19, 1912, after four years as consul in Aleppo, Jackson had his staff raise concerns with the foreign embassies in Constantinople that the Turkish government was determined to place the Vilayet of Aleppo under martial law, warning that Muslims, who had abandoned their duties from the army, were engaged in \\"depredations\\" in the province, which the Turkish authorities accused the Armenians of carrying out, so that the latter \\"shall be at the mercy of the Moslems.\\" Jackson requested that the embassies raise the issue with the Ottoman government, so as to prevent massacres against the Armenians \\"which, under the present strained conditions, would spread like wildfire, and likely engulf Christians of all denominations far and wide.\\" In April 1915, some months after the outbreak of World War I, a copy of a thirty-page \\"seditious\\" pamphlet was sent by Jackson to Henry Morgenthau, the U.S. ambassador in Constantinople. Published and printed in Arabic by the National Society of Defense for the Seat of the Caliphate and entitled \\"A Universal Proclamation to All the People of Islam\\", the pamphlet was distributed by the Germans and encouraged every Muslim to free the believers \\"in the Unity of God\\" from \\"the grasp of the infidels.\\" It also encouraged Muslims to boycott Armenian businesses: Jesse Jackson in his youth By spreading the pamphlet, Jackson believed that the Germans were trying to incite massacre. He added: \\"Surely something should be done to prevent the continuation of such propagandas in the future, or one day the result sought will be obtained, and it will be disastrous.\\" Deir ez-Zor. \\"The misery these people are suffering is terrible to imagine,\\" Jackson wrote. \\"The Armenians themselves say that they would by far have preferred a massacre, which would have been less disastrous to them.\\" On April 20, 1915, Jackson relayed to Morgenthau, to the secretary of state, and to the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, a report prepared by the Reverend John E. Merrill, president of Central Turkey College at Aintab, on the situation in the region stretching from Aintab to Marash and Zeitun. The nine-page document described the similarities between the contemporary situation in the Marash region and that during the previous Hamidian massacre and the Adana massacre of 1909. As during the massacres of 1895‚Äì96, it noted, the Turkish government was spreading false rumors that the Armenians in the Marash region were threatening law and order. Jackson claimed that the local officials deceived the Armenians in Zeitun and in nearby Furnus into surrendering their arms in hopes of averting punishment, as during the Adana massacres of 1909, while causing the death of innocent women and children. He further asserted that the conscription of young male Armenians into the Turkish army was followed by imprisonment, deportations, and massacres. Merrill believed that the deportation of the Marash region was \\"a direct blow at American missionary interests, menacing the results of more than fifty years of work and many thousands of dollars of expenditure.\\" Map of Armenian refugee camps in and around the Deir ez-Zor province. Jackson estimated that around 350,000 refugees had converged at Deir el-Zor, and more than 500,000 Armenians had been killed in the area months after the Armenian Genocide started. He reported that \\"the sides of the roads are strewn with the bones or decaying bodies\\" of the deportees in and around the province. By June 5, 1915, Jackson wrote to ambassador Morgenthau that the Ottoman government policy towards Armenians \\"is without doubt a carefully planned scheme to thoroughly extinguish the Armenian race.\\" In the same report, he wrote that a large influx of Armenians were pouring into Aleppo from Marash, Zeitun, Adana, Hajin, and other localities. Each group consisted of 300‚Äì500 old men, women, and children, as the young and the middle-aged had been ordered into military service. He added that thousands were being \\"scattered over the desert to starve or die of disease in burning heat\\". Jackson estimated that more than 25,000 Armenian refugees were in northern Syria and that \\"in the interior a perfect reign of terror exists.\\" As early as August 15, 1915, Jackson estimated that approximately 350,000 refugees had converged at Deir el-Zor, and more than 500,000 Armenians had been killed. He further reported that practically all the Armenians from the provinces of \\"Van, Erzeroum, Bitlis, Diarbekir, Mamouret ul-Aziz, Angora and Sivas have already been practically exterminated, and even conservative estimates already place the death toll well over 500,000.\\" In regards to looting and robbery, Jackson wrote that a \\"systematic search was made of each person before the murders and whatever money or article of value they possessed was taken from them by order of the governor who personally took charge of the loot. The actual murderers were permitted to profit by whatever clothing or other things found on the corpses, and many articles of clothing were recognized in Deir-el-Zor thereafter in the possession of these brigands and others to whom they were sold.\\" In a telegram dispatched on May 12, Jackson stated that \\"according to reports from reliable sources the accompanying gendarmes are told that they may do as they wish with the women and girls.\\" Armenian woman kneeling beside dead child in field \\"within sight of help and safety at Aleppo\\". Jackson reported that thousands of men, women, and children were being \\"scattered over the desert to starve or die of disease in burning heat\\". In a letter sent to Morgenthau on August 19, Jackson stated that the deportations were of all Armenians regardless of their religious affiliation (i.e., Catholicism or Protestantism). He noted that nine trains passed through Aleppo between 1 and 19 August, several of which were carrying thousands of Armenians from Ainteb who were subsequently robbed by villagers. Jackson described these \\"wartime anti-Armenian measures\\" as a \\"gigantic plundering scheme as well as a final blow to extinguish the race.\\" Jackson reported the statistics in detail of Meskene, a deportation zone, in a 10 September 1916 dispatch: \\"Information obtained on the spot permits me to state that nearly 60,000 Armenians are buried there, carried off by hunger, privations of all sorts, intestinal diseases and the typhus that results. As far as the eye can reach, mounds can be seen containing 200 to 300 corpses buried pell-mell, women children and old people belonging to different families.\\" The Sun on February 9, 1916, he is credited for saving the lives of \\"thousands of Armenians\\". On September 29, in a letter to Morgenthau, Jackson placed the survival rate of the deportees at about 15 percent and further noted that this had amounted to the deaths of about a million Armenians. He wrote: > One of the most terrible sights ever seen in Aleppo was the arrival early in > August, 1915, of some 5,000 terribly emaciated, dirty, ragged and sick women > and children, 3,000 in one day and 2,000 the following day. These people > were the only survivors of the thrifty and well to do Armenian population of > the province of Sivas, where the Armenian population had once been over > 300,000. He described the deplorable condition of the deportees; all were \\"sparsely clad and some naked from the treatment by their escorts and the despoiling depopulation en route. It is extremely rare to find a family intact that has come any considerable distance, invariably all having lost members from disease and fatigue, young girls and boys carried off by hostile tribesmen,\\" and the men separated from their families and killed. \\"The exhausted condition of the victims is further proven by the death of a hundred or more daily of those arriving in the city.\\" The situation was also reaffirmed by Consul R√∂ssler who reported on September 27 that Djemal Pasha had issued an order prohibiting the taking of photographs and that taking pictures of the Armenians was considered to be unauthorized photography of military operations. January 29, 1916, Bisbee Daily Review, \\"U.S. Consul and Wife Rescue Thousands of Armenians\\". Jackson is pictured with his wife with a caption that says, \\"Armenians say that it was solely owing to the energetic action of U.S. Consul Jesse B. Jackson at Aleppo, Syria, who adopted a strong attitude toward the Turkish military authorities, that thousands of Armenian lives in Aleppo and in the surrounding regions were saved.\\" Jackson also reported that those who were deported from Urfa were never heard of again, \\"though I sent a trustworthy Mohammedan on a five weeks journey throughout the interior into which they had disappeared to make a diligent search for any of the survivors, and I personally made many inquiries to that end. Without a doubt they suffered the fate of their fellow townsmen when at a safe distance from the city, and their bones lie bleaching in the sun and sands of the vast Mesopotamian desert.\\" A telegraph sent by Jackson to Secretary of State. The telegraph describes Talat Pasha's ordering of massacres: \\"The attention of the Department is respectfully drawn to the substance of the various telegraphic instructions from Talaat Pasha to the different Turkish officials, especially in Aleppo, the character of the said instructions being such as would indicate that few if any of the victims should have survived.\\" In October 1916, Jackson depicted the circumstances of those who were deported in caravans: \\"For another five days they [the Armenians] did not receive a morsel of bread, neither a drop of water. They were scorched to death by thirst, hundreds upon hundreds fell dead along the way, their tongues turned to charcoal. ... On the seventy-fifth day when they reached Halep [Aleppo] 150 women and children remained from the whole caravan of 18,000.\\" Jackson estimated that of the million Armenians who had been deported to Syria, about 100,000 survived and many other women and children were still held in captivity. In 1918, he reported that survivors had recounted to him: > The harrowing details of the separation of the grown male members of their > families therefrom, or the actual killing of them before the eyes of, their > relatives and friends, or of the robbing of the emigrants en route, of the > unlimited suffering and death of famished women and children, the > unbelievable brutality of the accompanying gendarmes towards young girls and > more attractive women, the carrying off by the Kurds and Turks of beautiful > girls, women, and children, and countless other atrocious crimes committed > against them all along the way. Jackson was later instrumental in organizing the relief effort sponsored by the American Committee for Relief in the Near East for the victims. The fund, which managed to collect initial funds of $100,000, assigned Jackson to administrate and manage its finances. He estimated that the minimum provisions to sustain life would require about $150,000 a month, or a dollar a day per capita. Under his supervision, Jackson upheld the task of caring for an estimated 150,000 refugees. Due to these efforts, he is credited with saving the lives of \\"thousands of Armenians.\\" On May 13, 1923, Jackson's duties at the American consulate of Aleppo ended when he was reassigned to the consulate of Leghorn, Italy.  Later life  Jackson served the American consulate in Leghorn until 1928 when he was reassigned to Fort William and Port Arthur in Canada. He subsequently resided there and ultimately retired in 1935. Jackson died on December 6, 1947, at the White Cross Hospital after suffering a short illness and is buried in Sunset Cemetery in Galloway, Ohio. In 1898, Jackson married Rosabelle Berryman, who died in 1928. They had a son named Virgil A. Jackson. Jackson was honoured with: Officer (Knight) of the Order of the Crown of Italy, Honorary Medal for Charitable Assistance (Netherlands), and the Order of Merit (Lebanon).

Cox\\", Globe and Mail, October 22, 2011. http://www.billgladstone.ca/?p=3464 He was part of a generation of sculptors such as Charles Daudelin who preferred to carve rather than model their work. Cox carved in wood, stone and even on metal, ceramics, glass and gemstones.  Life and education Elford Bradley Cox was born in Botha, Alberta, the second son of John and Eva (Tabb). His mother died when he was 13 years old. Cox attended Victoria College, University of Toronto between 1934 and 1938, where he met Professor Barker Fairley, through whom he became acquainted with many artists, including members of the Group of Seven.Dault, Gary Michael. \\"E.B.

After serving as an interpreter during World War II and a brief teaching career at Upper Canada College, he took up sculpting full-time in the 1950s. Cox pioneered the use of the compressed-air chisel and other power tools in creating sculpture. The technique enabled him to single- handedly create large-scale installations. Cox has more sculpture on view in Toronto's public places than any other single artist.Ardiel, June. \\"Sculpture/Toronto: An Illustrated Guide to Toronto's Historic and Contemporary Sculpture with Area Maps\\", Leidra Books, Toronto, 1994. Sculptures Cox is best known for his large works featured at many Toronto- area landmarks, including: * Spring Break-Up (Fish Fountain), 1958, Park Hyatt Hotel, Avenue Road north of Bloor St., Toronto. (Moved in March 2018 to Ingram Gallery, 24 Hazelton Avenue, while the hotel is being renovated.) This sculpture is one of the first non-architectural decorative sculptures introduced into Toronto for the purpose of making the courtyard of a building more attractive. * Draped Figures, 1959, at Victoria University, University of Toronto (Note: these three sculptures were put into temporary storage in 2014). This work has been described as one that \\"hinted at the abstraction to finally come to the city...change was around the corner, and in the 1960s Toronto did finally experience a revolution in public sculpture.\\" * Great White Lady, 1960, on display at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario. * The Garden of the Greek Gods, 1963, comprising twenty sculptures and a marker stone. On public display at Exhibition Place in Toronto until 2014. Since then, the sculpture garden has been hidden behind the fences of Muzik Nightclub, now called Toronto Event Centre. * The Days of the Year, 1968, bronze and glass, Macdonald Block (Ontario Government building), Toronto (temporarily in storage during building renovations). Among other leading Canadian sculptors of the 1960s, Cox was chosen to produce a work of public art for this huge new government building. It is one of his rare constructive pieces. * Youth and the Environment, 1972, on display at Exhibition Place in Toronto. * Bear Family, c.1970, on display at Centre Island, Toronto. * A Druid's Alphabet, 1961, two large door panels, on display at Glendon Campus, York University, Toronto. * Bears in limestone (3), 1970‚Äì1971, on display at Exhibition Place in Toronto. * Bear, 1979, on display at the Guild Inn, Scarborough (created with assistance from Michael Clay). * Seated Lady, 1967, on display at the Peel County Court House in Brampton, Ontario. * Books 1967, on display in front of Richmond Hill High School, Richmond Hill, Ontario. Garden of the Greek Gods controversy Cox's work became the subject of a dispute in 2014 when the 20 limestone sculptures comprising the Garden of the Greek Gods, created by Cox in the 1960s, were hidden from view at the Muzik nightclub (now called Toronto Event Centre). This sculpture garden was donated to the City of Toronto in 1979 and installed on the south lawn of the Horticulture Building, where it was enjoyed by the art-loving public for over 30 years. When the nightclub built a huge outdoor patio in 2014, it fenced in the entire collection and made it inaccessible to the public. Family and friends expressed concern both about possible damage to the work and the fact that it is no longer freely accessible to children. Cox had originally intended that children be able to play on the sculptures. At an Exhibition Place Board of Governors meeting in June 2016, city councillor Mike Layton accused Muzik owner Zlatko Starkovski of holding the sculptures hostage to extract more lenient rules from the board as to the type of events Muzik is allowed to host. The board, however, allowed Starkovski's proposed changes without requiring the return of the sculptures. In October 2016 the issue was debated by City Council; Council voted 36-2 to include the return of the Garden of the Greek Gods sculptures to the city as a condition of amending Muzik's lease on Exhibition Place grounds.

Home games are played at College Park Center, located on University of Texas at Arlington's campus in Arlington. The team has appeared in eight AIAW National Tournaments, eight NCAA Tournaments and one National Invitational Volleyball Championship Tournament, collecting 12 regular seasons titles and ten conference tournament titles along the way.  Team history  Louisiana‚ÄìMonroe The Mavericks began competition in the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women, as the NCAA didn't sponsor women's sports until the early 1980s. UTA's first coach was Jody Conradt who was also the head coach for the basketball and softball teams. Right away, the Mavericks were competitors, appearing in the AIAW National Tournament eight out of a possible nine times, finishing as high as sixth nationally in 1981. They placed in the national tournament every year but one. When the NCAA began competition, the Mavericks moved over to the Southland Conference, where UTA was a founding member in 1963. The Mavericks immediately became the most dominant team in the conference winning the first nine regular season titles. UTA won the first conference tournament in 1982, but the NCAA structure didn't allow UTA to play in a postseason match. Second- seeded Lamar would win the conference tournament in 1983 and 1984 and again the Mavericks missed playing in the postseason. The Mavericks finally won the SLC tournament in 1985 under Head Coach Lisa Love and would also claim the next five after that. The Mavericks would establish themselves as national contenders as they made four Sweet Sixteen appearances, two Elite Eight's and a Final Four in 1989. The Mavericks slipped in stature during the '90's after Coach Love took over the program at USC. They were no longer the perennial Southland Conference favorite, though they did win three regular season championships in the '90's and two tournament crowns. Despite being five seasons removed from the Southland, the volleyball team still has four more regular season championships and three more tournament titles. In October 2015 against in-state Sun Belt rival Texas State, UTA's volleyball home attendance record was broken with 2,018 fans attending the match.  Facilities  Until 2012, the Mavericks played at Texas Hall, which is a 3,300-seat theater on the campus. The teams played on the stage, and fans could watch the game from either the theater seats or the bleacher section. A new arena called the College Park Center with a seating capacity of 7,000 opened for the 2012 season. The facility is located on the eastern side of the campus along with new housing, parking, and retail developments.  Coaches  The Mavericks have had 7 coaches, listed below, in their 40+ year history. J.T. Wenger, a former volleyball player at UCLA and former assistant coach at UCLA, Michigan State, and Colorado, is the current head coach.

It is located twelve miles northeast of Perryville, sixty-three miles south of Saint Louis, and lies directly on the Mississippi River. Etymology The spelling of the name was first Clearyville, as it was named for John Cleary, a nearby farmer. The name was eventually changed to correspond to the pronunciation.Missouri State Historical Society: Perry County Place Names http://shs.umsystem.edu/manuscripts/ramsay/ramsay_perry.html Claryville was also known unofficially as West Chester. ***New information has been made available from the U.S. Department of the interior Bureau of Land Management General Land Office Records. The new information shows that the historians were incorrect about the original spelling of not only of the town but also John's surname. He was in fact John W. Clary. This PDF file is a copy of the original document. John W. Clary received the land for his service to the United States of America in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, under the authority of the ScripWarrant Act of 1847 (9 Stat. 123) He was awarded the maximum amount of land, which was 160 acres, in his grant.  History  Claryville was first settled in 1869, and the town was platted in 1871. The first mayor was V.P. Tucker and its first merchant was E. J. Rhodes. As of 1912, the town had three general stores and a population of 140. Subsequent floods over the years have diminished the town's population. Geography Claryville is situated in the Mississippi River Valley within an alluvial flood plain called the Bois Brule Bottom. Its location along the Mississippi River has made Claryville susceptible to flooding.

She played college basketball at the University of Michigan from 1989 to 1993. She holds the Michigan Wolverines women's basketball records for career rebounds (982), single-season rebounds (311), career blocks (367), and single-season blocks (136). Early years A native of Winnetka, Illinois, Andrew played high school basketball at New Trier High School. Because of her talent for rebounding and blocking shots, she earned the nickname the \\"human eraser.\\" She was named to the Chicago Tribune's All-State team in 1989. University of Michigan In the fall of 1989, Andrew enrolled at the University of Michigan. She played for the Michigan Wolverines women's basketball team from 1989 to 1993.Michigan Record Book, p.2. As a freshman during the 1989-90 season, Andrew broke Michigan's single-season record with 64 blocked shots and helped lead the Wolverines to a 20-10 record.Michigan Record Book, p. 15. The season was the program's first 20-win season and the first in which the Wolverines received an invitation to play in the NCAA Tournament. As a sophomore during the 1990-91 season, Andrew broke her own record with 88 shot blocks. By January 1991, and after only 42 games with the Wolverines, Andrew blocked her 112th career shot to become the leading shot-blocker in the history of the Michigan women's basketball program. Andrew credited her talent for blocks to \\"long arms\\", while Michigan head coach Bud VanDeWege noted: \\"She doesn't do it with great leaping ability -- many times she doesn't even leave the ground to block a shot -- so it's mostly the timing. It's a real gift to have.\\" As a junior during the 1991-92 season, Andrew again broke her own record with 136 blocks‚Äîa total that remains 62 more than any other player in the program's history. Her 136 blocks also stood as the Big Ten Conference record until 2007. Andrew also led the 1991-92 Wolverines with 522 points, a total that remains the sixth highest in program history, and 278 rebounds (9.9 per game). In December 1991, Andrew had her nose broken while making a rebound against the Bowling Green Falcons. On February 28, 1992, she scored a career-high 36 points with 16 field goals against Indiana.Michigan Record Book, p. 10. As a senior during the 1992-93 season, Andrew established Michigan's single-season records with 311 rebounds and an average of 11.5 rebounds per game.Michigan Record Book, p. 9. She also led the team in points (514) and blocks (79). On December 28, 1992, she had a career-high 21 rebounds against Bucknell.Michigan Record Book, p. 11. Two days later, she had a career-high 10 shot blocks in a game against the Old Dominion Lady Monarchs. (She had four games in which she blocked nine shots.) At the end of the 1992-93 season, Andrew was selected as an Academic All-Big Ten Conference player.Michigan Record Book, p. 17. Andrew remains Michigan's all-time career leader with 928 rebounds and 367 blocks. Her 368 blocks also stood as the Big Ten Conference record for 14 years until it was broken in 2007 by Jessica Davenport. Andrews also holds Michigan's single-season records with 311 rebounds during the 1992-93 season and 136 blocks during the 1991-92 season.Michigan Record Book, p. 6. In four years at Michigan, Andrew scored 1,647 points, which at the time was second only to Diane Dietz. She currently ranks as the third highest scorer in the program's history.Michigan Record Book, pp. 2 and 7. Her career total of 701 field goals also ranks second highest in program history.Michigan Record Book, p. 7. Later years After graduating from Michigan, Andrew played professional basketball in Greece. She retired from the Greek league after a contract dispute and returned to the Chicago area in 1995. She currently spends her time teaching, walking on the beach with her trusty pooch, Happy, and reminiscing about her glory days as Michigan's \\"human eraser\\", contemplating her place amongst Michigan legends Yost, Schembechler, and Harbaugh.

Two storms in particular, Cyclone Josie and Tropical Storm Lisette formed in the Channel and inundated much of Mozambique. Affecting a country already inundated by Cyclone Josie earlier in the year, Lisette brought additional flooding to the nation. The Nampula Province in Mozambique was severely damaged by the storm, where many roads were damaged. Effects from the system spread as far north as northern Mozambique. Overall, 87 people died while 80,000 others were directly affected. Meteorological history In late January into February 1997, the ITCZ produced areas of convection around the northern tip of Madagascar. One such convective system from spawned a low pressure area between Tromelin island and Agal√©ga, which initially was still located within the ITCZ. On February 5, the M√©t√©o-France office on R√©union (MFR) reported that system developed into a tropical depression, and failed to intensify further while executing a clockwise loop off northeastern Madagascar. After the convection increased, both MFR and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimate that the depression intensified into a tropical storm on February 8 and was named Josie by the Meteorological Services of Madagascar. Subsequently, the storm moved across northern Madagascar and emerged into the Mozambique Channel on February 9 as a tropical depression, its structure deteriorated. Josie turned to the southwest around western Madagascar, and despite warm waters it initially failed to re-intensify much. On February 11, MFR estimated that Josie re-attained tropical storm status, and subsequently turned to the south due to a broad area of low pressure in the region. Data from MFR suggested that the storm quickly intensified once moving far enough away from Madagascar, becoming a tropical cyclone on February 13 and soon after reaching peak 10-winds of 140 km/h (85 mph); in contrast, the JTWC estimated peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph). While near peak intensity, the eyewall of Josie passed over Europa Island. An approaching cold front turned the cyclone to the southeast, bringing the storm over cooler waters and causing weakening due to increased wind shear. On February 16, Josie became extratropical well to the south of Madagascar, and dissipated the next day. On February 24, following decreased pressures across the northern Mozambique channel after Josie's demise, the ITCZ spawned a tropical wave. An atmospheric circulation began to subsequently develop along the wave axis as it was centered just offshore the Mozambique coast. Situated in an environment with warm sea surface temperatures, the system was first classified by MFR late on February 24, though the JTWC did not start watching the system until the next day, when it was located slightly onshore Mozambique. The following day, MFR upgraded the system into a tropical depression while located within of the coast of Mozambique. The system slowly became better organized as the storm drifting generally south and on the evening of February 27, the storm developed a central dense overcast, a large mass of deep convection, and was thus upgraded into a moderate tropical storm while located halfway between Mozambique and Madagascar. By this time, intensity estimates from the JTWC indicated that the storm had attained hurricane-equivalent status. Following the movement of a trough, Lisette abruptly turned west, though the storm's motion remained slow. Meanwhile, Lisette began to deepen, and by that evening, the storm began to develop an eye. Based on this, MFR upgraded the storm into a severe tropical storm. At this time, the storm attained its peak intensity of , although JTWC data indicates that Cyclone Lisette was significantly stronger, with winds of , making Lisette a moderate Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. However, early on March 1, the storm leveled off in intensity for no known reason, though it has been theorized that this was due to an increase wind shear. After maintaining its intensity for a day, it began to approach the coast of Mozambique and thus began to show hints of additional development due a sudden decrease in shear. According to the JTWC, the storm peaked in intensity with winds of . However, MFR suggests that the storm did not intensify prior to landfall on March 1\\\\. Although the JTWC stopped monitoring the system the subsequent day, MFR tracked this system until March 3, when it was located over Zimbabwe, ending the above-average season. Impact and aftermath Facing a region already inundated by Cyclone Josie less than a month prior, Lisette was also the fourth tropical cyclone observed in the Mozambique Channel that season, thought it was the only storm of the year to strike Mozambique. Tropical Storm Lisette brought additional flooding to the nation. Most of the south-central Mozambique was drenched with rainfall totals ranging from to , setting numerous records. Due to the precursor disturbance of Lisette, the Nampula Province in Mozambique was severely flooded by the storm, severely damaging several roads, though two of the roads were eventually repaired. The Sofala and Inhambane Provinces were also badly affected by the system; widespread flooding spread as far north as northern Mozambique. Due to the storm, many sooty terns (Onychoprion fuscatus) were swept inland from the coast for only the second time in recorded history. Overall, 87 people perished in the cyclone while 80,000 others were directly affected. Several years after the passage of the system, an appeal was launched for money from the Government of South Africa, asking them to pay for the damaged roads, but because the road was built by a private company, the appeal was denied.

For mild forms of the condition, advice and counseling are often all that are necessary. For more severe forms, treatment may consist in blood transfusion; chelation therapy to reverse iron overload, using drugs such as deferoxamine, deferiprone, or deferasirox; medication with the antioxidant indicaxanthin to prevent the breakdown of hemoglobin; or a bone marrow transplant using material from a compatible donor, or from the patient's mother. Removal of the spleen (splenectomy) could theoretically help to reduce the need for blood transfusions in people with thalassaemia major or intermedia but there is currently no reliable evidence from clinical trials about its effects. Population screening has had some success as a preventive measure. Levels of severity * Mild thalassemia : patients with thalassemia traits do not require medical or follow-up care after the initial diagnosis is made. Patients with Œ≤-thalassemia trait should be warned that their condition can be misdiagnosed for the common Iron deficiency anemia. They should eschew empirical use of Iron therapy; yet iron deficiency can develop during pregnancy or from chronic bleeding. Counseling is indicated in all persons with genetic disorders, especially when the family is at risk of a severe form of disease that may be prevented. * Severe thalassemia : Patients with severe thalassemia require medical treatment. A blood transfusion regimen was the first measure effective in prolonging life. Medication Patients with thalassemia gradually accumulate high levels of iron (Fe) in their bodies. This build-up of iron may be due to the disease itself, from irregular hemoglobin not properly incorporating adequate iron into its structure, or it may be due to the many blood transfusions received by the patient. This overload of iron brings with it many biochemical complications. Two key substances involved in iron transport and storage in the body are ferritin and transferrin. Ferritin is a protein present within cells that binds to Fe (II) and stores it as Fe (III), releasing it into the blood whenever required. Transferrin is an iron-binding protein present in blood plasma; transferrin acts as a transporter, carrying iron through blood and providing cells with the metal through endocytosis. Transferrin is highly specific to iron (III), and binds to it with an equilibrium constant of 1023 M‚àí1 at a pH of 7.4. Thalassemia results in nontransferrin-bound iron being available in blood as all the transferrin becomes fully saturated. This free iron is toxic to the body since it catalyzes reactions that generate free hydroxyl radicals.> These radicals may induce lipid peroxidation of organelles like lysosomes, mitochondria, and sarcoplasmic membranes. The resulting lipid peroxides may interact with other molecules to form cross links, and thus either cause these compounds to perform their functions poorly, or render them non-functional altogether. This iron overload may be treated with chelation therapy. Deferoxamine, deferiprone and deferasirox are the three most widely used iron- chelating agents. =Deferoxamine= Structure and coordination The drug deferoxamine, also known as desferoxamine B and DFO-B, is a trihydroxamic acid that is produced by the actinobacteria Streptomyces pilosus. It binds iron, decreasing the toxic reactions catalysed by the unbound metal, and it also decreases the uptake of iron by tissues. Deferoxamine achieves this by acting as a hexadentate iron-chelating ligand: it binds to all six coordination sites on nontransferrin-bound iron, effectively deactivating it. Deferoxamine is mostly specific to ferric iron (Fe3+) and coordinates to Fe3+ using the oxygen atoms on its multiplehydroxyl and carbonyl groups, forming a structure called ferrioxamine. This drug-iron complex is mostly excreted by the kidneys as it is water-soluble. Approximately one-third of ferrioxamine could also be excreted through the feces in bile. Administration and action Deferoxamine is administered via intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injections. Oral administration is not possible as deferoxamine is rapidly metabolized by enzymes and is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The required parenteral administration represents one of deferoxamine‚Äôs downfalls as it is harder for patients to follow up with their therapy due to the financial and emotional burdens experienced. Deferoxamine was proven to cure many clinical complications and diseases that result from iron overload. It beneficially affects cardiac disease, such as myocardial disease which occurs as a result of iron accumulation in the heart. Deferoxamine was also shown to improve liver function by arresting the development of hepatic fibrosis which occurs as a result of iron accumulation in the liver. Deferoxamine also has positive effects on endocrine function and growth. Endocrine abnormalities in thalassemic patients involve the overloaded iron interfering with the production of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), as well as stimulating hypogonadism, both of which cause poor pubertal growth. A study showed that 90% of patients who were regularly treated with deferoxamine since childhood had normal pubertal growth, which fell to 38% for patients treated only with low doses of deferoxamine since their teens. Another endocrine abnormality that thalassemic patients face is diabetes mellitus, which results from iron overload in the pancreas impairing insulin secretion. Studies have shown that patients who were regularly treated with deferoxamine have a reduced risk of developing diabetes mellitus. Side effects Deferoxamine could lead to toxic side effects if doses greater than 50 mg/kg body weight are administered. These side effects may include auditory and ocular abnormalities, pulmonary toxicity, sensorimotor neurotoxicity, as well as changes in renal function. Another toxic effect of deferoxamine mostly observed in children is the failure of linear growth. This reduction in height may occur as a result of deferoxamine chelating metals other than iron which are required for normal growth. Deferoxamine has an affinity constant (Ka) of 1031 for Fe3+, 1014 for Cu2+ and 1010 for Zn2+, and so may coordinate to zinc and copper when little iron is available for chelation. Zinc is needed for the proper functioning of various metalloenzymes involved in bone formation. Zinc chelation may cause zinc deficiency in the body, which can thus lead to a reduced growth rate, reduced collagen formation and defective bone mineralization. Similarly, copper functions as an enzyme cofactor in bone formation. Copper chelation may result in copper deficiency as well, leading to metaphyseal cupping and osteoporosis. For example, abnormal collagen is formed when copper is deficient as the enzyme lysyl oxidase, which uses copper as a cofactor and catalyzes the oxidative deamination step that is important for cross-linking of collagen, cannot function properly. Studies have shown that even though the blood serum of patients receiving deferoxamine was not deficient in copper and zinc, deficiencies of the metals in the metaphyseal matrix were observed. The toxic effect of deferoxamine on linear growth could also be due to excess deferoxamine accumulating in tissues and interfering with iron-dependent enzymes which are involved in the post-translational modification of collagen. Patients who receive vitamin C supplements have shown improved iron excretion by deferoxamine. This occurs due to the expansion of the iron pool brought about by vitamin C, which deferoxamine subsequently has access to. However, vitamin C supplementation could also worsen iron toxicity by promoting the formation of free radicals. Therefore, only 100 mg of vitamin C should be taken 30 minutes to one hour after deferoxamine administration. It has also been proven that combined treatment with deferoxamine and deferiprone leads to an increased efficiency in chelation and doubles iron excretion. =Deferiprone= Structure and coordination Deferiprone Deferiprone (DFP) is a bidentate iron-chelator. Three molecules of the drug therefore coordinate to one iron atom, forming an orthorhombic structure. DFP is synthetically made and is highly selective to Fe(III). Physical properties that allow this compound to be effective as a drug include its water solubility, low molecular weight (139 Da), neutral charge, and lipophilicity. These physio-chemical properties allow facile crossing of cell membranes throughout the body, including the blood-brain barrier, facilitating removal of excess iron from within organs. Although the mechanism for the removal of iron by DFP is not well understood, however, a study by Viroj Wiwanitkit in 2006 proposed a possible mechanism: the coordination to the iron was thought to occur through the cleavage of either a C-C bond or a C-O bond in the drug. Wiwanitkit concluded that the mechanism goes through the cleavage of the C-C bond because this bond requires less energy to be cleaved. The total energy for the cleavage was found to be negative, suggesting spontaneity and thermodynamic favourability of the cleavage. The resulting structure of the product also resembled the observed tertiary structureof the drug-iron complex. Administration and action Deferiprone is an iron chelator that is orally active, its administration thus being much easier than that for deferoxamine. Plasma levels for the iron-drug complex climax after one hour of intake and the drug has a half-life of 160 minutes. Most of the iron-drug complex is therefore excreted within three to four hours following administration, the excretion occurring mostly in urine (90%). When comparing deferiprone to deferoxamine, they both bind iron with similar efficiency. However, drugs with different properties are able to access different iron pools. DFP is smaller than deferoxamine and can thus enter cells more easily. Also, at the pH of blood, the affinity of DFP for iron is concentration dependent: at low DFP concentrations, the iron-drug complex breaks down and the iron is donated to another competing ligand. This property accounts for the observed tendency of DFP to redistribute iron in the body. For the same reason, DFP can ‚Äòshuttle‚Äô intracellular iron out to the plasma, and transfer the iron to deferoxamine which goes on to expel it from the body. DFP was also found to be significantly more effective than deferoxamine in treating myocardial siderosis in patients with thalassemia major: DFP is thought to improve the function of mitochondria in the heart by accessing and redistributing labile iron in cardiac cells. Thalassemia patients may also be faced with potential oxidative damage to brain cells as the brain has high oxygen demands, but contains relatively low levels of antioxidant agents for protection against oxidation. The presence of excess iron in the brain may lead to higher concentrations of free radicals. Hexadentate chelators, like deferoxamine, are large molecules, and are thus unlikely to be able to cross the blood-brain barrier to chelate the excess iron. DFP, however, can do so and forms a soluble, neutral iron-drug complex that can cross cell membranes by non-facilitated diffusion. Attaching the drug to sugars may additionally enhance the penetration of the blood-brain barrier, as the brain uses facilitated transport for its relatively high levels of sugar intake. Side effects DFP can be subjected to glucuronidation in the liver, which may expel as much as 85% of the drug from the body before it has had a chance to chelate iron. DFP also has a well-known safety profile, with agranulocytosis being the most serious side effect. While agranulocytosis has been reported in less than 2% of patients treated, it is potentially life- threatening and thus requires close monitoring of the white blood cell count. Less serious side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, which were found in 33% of patients in the first year of administration, but fell to 3% in following years; arthralgia; and zinc deficiency, with the latter being a problem especially for individuals with diabetes. =Deferasirox= Structure and coordination Deferasirox Deferasirox is an N-substituted bis-hydroxyphenyl-triazole. It is capable of removing iron from the blood through the coordination of two molecules of the deferasirox to a single iron ion, which forms the iron chelate (Fe-[deferasirox]2). Each molecule of the tridentate chelator deferasirox binds to the iron at three sites, using one nitrogen atom and two oxygen atoms. This results in a stable octahedral geometry around the iron centre. The ability of deferasirox to remove iron stems directly from its relatively small size, which is what allows it to access the iron contained within the blood and inside tissues. Also, an important feature of deferasirox is that it has been shown to be highly selective for iron in the +3 oxidation state, and use of the drug does not lead to a significant decrease in the levels of other important metals in the body. Administration and action Deferasirox-Iron (III) complex Deferasirox is most commonly marketed under the brand name Exjade. It has one key advantage over desferoxamine in that it can be taken orally in pill form, and so does not require intravenous or subcutaneous administration. With a terminal elimination half life of 8‚Äì16 hours, the deferasirox pill can be taken just once everyday. A once-daily dose of 20 mg/kg of body weight has been found to be sufficient for most patients for the maintenance of liver iron concentration (LIC) levels, which are usually measured as mg of iron per g of liver tissue. Larger doses may be required for some patients in order to reduce LIC levels. The ability of deferasirox to effectively reduce LIC levels has been well documented. One study demonstrated that after 4‚Äì5 years of deferasirox treatment the mean LIC levels of patients decreased from 17.4 ¬± 10.5 to 9.6 ¬± 8.0 mg Fe/g. This study showed that long-term treatment did result in a sustainable reduction in the iron burden faced by patients receiving blood transfusions for thalassemia. An additional benefit of the use of deferasirox instead of desferoxamine is that, unlike desferoxamine, early studies have indicated that deferasirox does not have a significant impact on the growth and development of pediatric thalassemia patients. In a study by Cappellini et al. it was shown that children receiving the treatment displayed continual near-normal growth and development over a 5-year study period. Side effects Deferasirox can, however, have a wide variety of side effects. These may include headaches, nausea, vomiting, and joint pains. Some evidence has been shown of a link to gastrointestinal disorders experienced by some people who have received the treatment. =Indicaxanthin= Structure Indicaxanthin, the yellow pigment of the cactus pear fruit Indicaxanthin is a pigment derived from the cactus pear fruit and can be used as an antioxidant. Dietary indicaxanthin has been shown to have protective effects on RBCs in people with beta thalassemia. It has a structure similar to that of amino acids, and is amphiphilic: it is able to bind to cell membranes through charge-related interactions with polar head groups of membrane constituents, as well through adsorption to the lipid aggregates. Upon ex vivo introduction to thalassemic blood, indicaxanthin was shown to accumulate within RBCs. Function Hb undergoes the following oxidation reaction during normal controlled breakdown of RBCs: Hb ‚Üí Oxy-Hb ‚Üí Met-Hb ‚Üí [Perferryl- Hb] ‚Üí Oxoferryl ‚Üí further oxidation steps This reaction is experienced by thalassemic RBCs to a greater extent because, not only are there more oxidative radicals in thalassemic blood, but thalassemic RBCs also have limited antioxidant defense. Indicaxanthin is able to reduce the perferryl-Hb, a reactive intermediate, back to met-Hb. The overall effect of this step is that Hb degradation is prevented, which helps prevent accelerated breakdown of RBCs. In addition, indicaxathin has been shown to reduce oxidative damage in cells and tissues and does so by binding to radicals. The mechanism of its function, however, is still unknown. Indicaxanthin has high bioavailability and minimal side effects, like vomiting or diarrhea. Carrier detection *A screening policy exists in Cyprus to reduce the incidence of thalassemia, which since the program's implementation in the 1970s (which also includes pre-natal screening and abortion) has reduced the number of children born with the hereditary blood disease from 1 out of every 158 births to almost zero. *In Iran as a premarital screening, the man's red cell indices are checked first, if he has microcytosis (mean cell hemoglobin < 27 pg or mean red cell volume < 80 fl), the woman is tested. When both are microcytic their hemoglobin A2 concentrations are measured. If both have a concentration above 3.5% (diagnostic of thalassemia trait) they are referred to the local designated health post for genetic counseling. In 2008, in Spain, a baby was selectively implanted in order to be a cure for his brother's thalassemia. The child was born from an embryo screened to be free of the disease before implantation with In vitro fertilization. The baby's supply of immunologically compatible cord blood was saved for transplantation to his brother. The transplantation was considered successful.Spanish Baby Engineered To Cure Brother In 2009, a group of doctors and specialists in Chennai and Coimbatore registered the successful treatment of thalassemia in a child using a sibling's umbilical cord blood.His sister's keeper: Brother's blood is boon of life, Times of India, 17 September 2009 Bone marrow transplant It is possible to be cured, by a bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from compatible donor. In low-risk young people, the thalassemia-free survival rate is 87%; the mortality risk is 3%. The drawback is that this method requires an HLA- matched compatible donor. If the person does not have an HLA-matched compatible donor, there is another method called bone marrow transplantation from haploidentical mother to child (mismatched donor), in which the donor is the mother. The results are these: thalassemia-free survival rate 70%, rejection 23%, and mortality 7%. The best results are with very young people.

It was released in Japan on January 24, 2013, Europe on October 28, 2013 and North America on November 5, 2013. A sequel, The Awakened Fate Ultimatum, was released September 25, 2014 in Japan, March 17, 2015 in North America, and March 20, 2015 in Europe.  Gameplay  The game is a randomly generated Dungeon Crawler taking place from an isometric perspective, in which the player embarks into themed dungeons, attempting to level up and ultimately beat the boss of the dungeon. Renya is also accompanied by a selectable angel, who provides support by attacking enemies, healing/buffing the player, or throwing them to different places. If the angel dies in battle, they become unavailable until the player is killed or leaves the dungeon. The player can equip different weapons and armor, which increases in power when it is used in battle, until it \\"Bursts\\", reducing its power. Bursting an item allows it to be leveled up at the blacksmith if the player can bring it back to the base. It also gives the player a \\"holy icon\\" which the player can use to increase their innate abilities and those of their angels. If the player dies or exits the dungeon, their \\"total level\\" increases, giving boosts to the player's innate stats even though they return to level 1. Later on, the player gains the ability to use \\"summon sets\\", sets of equipment that cannot be lost upon death, but can only be summoned for a set number of turns. Plot The game takes place in the fictional multiverse established in the Disgaea series. It follows Renya Kagurazaka, a boy who wins the position of God in a mall raffle. He is immediately taken to Celestia, where he meets seven Angels who serve and guide him. Of particular import is the angel Lilliel, his \\"personal angel\\" who acts as his de facto partner in battle. He learns that his new job as God requires him to grant the wishes of people who pray to him. He does this using a machine called the \\"Fate Revolution Circuit\\", which generates dungeons in a \\"Copy World\\" that mirrors the real world. By traveling through these dungeons and fighting monsters called \\"Aberrations\\", Renya can influence fate in the real world and affect the lives of the people who make the wishes. Each chapter focuses on a different wisher whose wish Renya must grant. The wishes start out as unusual and comical, for example, Cinderella expressing her discontent with the happy ending associated with her fairy tale. Ultimately, Renya's task takes a darker turn, as the angels reveal that the use of the Fate Revolution Circuit is merely a training device to allow him to gain power for his true task, stopping the incredibly powerful demon known as Satanael who will destroy Celestia if left unchecked. His title of \\"God\\" is not entirely correct, as there were many \\"Gods\\" who came before him and were killed by Satanael. Renya also begins to fall in love with Lilliel, with whom he formerly had a more platonic relationship. Ultimately, Satanael's subordinates, Varael and Frunetti, infiltrate the machine and fight against Renya while he is in the process of granting wishes. However, Renya defeats them. Renya also encounters an even more powerful being known as the Creator, who tells him that he created demons, also known as \\"black wings\\", with angels, or \\"white wings\\", merely being a mutation of them. Satanael, also known as \\"Triple Six\\", was his strongest creation, one that became even stronger than the Creator himself. This breaks Lilliel's resolve, but she is able to continue helping Renya after some soul-searching. Renya makes the Creator promise to seal away his creation abilities if he can defeat Satanael. Upon gaining sufficient power, Renya travels to the Netherworld with Lilliel, having placed the Fate Revolution Circuit into himself rather than the other way around. While he is fighting, Mysiel, the angel who created the Fate Revolution Circuit and uploaded herself into the machine, erases most of his memories to increase his power levels. Ultimately, Renya is able to fight and defeat Satanael, but the \\"overclocking\\" causes him to perish. Lilliel sacrifices her angel powers in order to bring him back to life, although the Creator remarks that he could have easily saved Renya even if Lilliel did not. Renya and Lilliel settle down on Earth to live a normal human life, with both of them having lost all their special powers. Development The game was originally revealed in Japan on July 11, 2012 as a 20th anniversary commemorative for Nippon Ichi Software. It was also developed largely by the same team behind the Disgaea series, while Noizi Ito worked as the game's character designer and Y≈çsei Teikoku composed the music. The game also has Love Live!'s idol group Œº's as main female characters' voice actress, and is credited under their character name instead of voice actress.  Reception  Bradly Hale of Hardcore Gamer gave the game a 4/5, saying \\"The Guided Fate Paradox is a niche game, but that shouldn‚Äôt scare off anyone who has a taste for Japanese RPGs. Its story does a balancing act of providing lighthearted fun and philosophical poignancy, while its gameplay is perhaps one of the deepest endeavors on the PS3 right now.\\" References External links * * Category:2013 video games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Nippon Ichi Software games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 3-only games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Video games about angels Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games using procedural generation ","title":"The Guided Fate Paradox"},{"id":"40025961","text":"Mateusz Cichocki (born 31 January 1992), is a Polish footballer who plays as a centre back for Radomiak Radom.

It is also a festival in the Aztec religion dedicated to Toci and Tlazolteotl and is also the month of cleaning or sweeping away. Ochpaniztli was largely concerned with sweeping, which was a reference to the rush of winds that occurred in the valley of Mexico before the winter rains came, the end of the growing season and the start of the harvesting season, the season of war when the Mexica went to war for captives to sacrifice to the gods, who could never have enough human flesh to eat.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 200. For the first five days of Ochpaniztli, the emphasis was on silence and quiet in Tenochtitlan.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. On the sixth day and continuing for eight more, warriors would march through the streets of Tenochtitlan carrying flowering branches until dusk.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. The warriors maintained tight discipline as they circled in elaborate maneuvers carrying marigolds and in complete silence except for the beating of the drums.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 76. After eight days, the women of the doctor's guild and the midwives guild, all wearing the tobacco poach that showed their membership in the guilds, would come out to engage in mock battles on the streets of Tenochtitlan.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. The women attacked each in mock combat with the branches and flowers rolled into balls dropped by the warriors, before sweeping the streets so that the woman dressed as Toci, \\"Our Grandmother\\" would be paraded through the streets.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. Toci, the \\"Woman of Discord\\", in Mexica religion, loved the carnage and bloody mayhem of war, and it was to honor her that Ochpanitztli marked the beginning of the season of war.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 76. To honor Toci, a young female slave was chosen to be the ixipta (proxy) for Toci, being kept in a cage and being especially cleaned everyday to prepare her for her sacrifice for Toci.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 76. It was very important that the woman chosen to die for Toci was ritually pure for her sacrifice, being guarded by other women who kept her in a cage both to prevent her escape and to ensure that she did not have sex for the twenty days prior to her death, making her a \\"pure\\" victim.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 76. The mock battles between the women as they pelted each other with balls of cactus leaves, moss, marigolds and reeds was to make the ixipta laugh, because the young woman chosen to die was never allowed to cry.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 77. The climax of the festival of Ochpaniztli was the sacrifice of a young woman from one of the peoples subjected to the power of the Mexica who for four days was bedecked with flowers and perfume and was teased by the woman taking care of her day about her impending doom.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. The woman was dressed as Toci and had black make-up applied around her mouth while the rest of her face was covered in white make-up, thereby making her resemble Toci whose face was a deathly shade of white except for her area around her mouth where her skin was black.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 76. One of Toci's favorite foods besides human flesh was human excrement, and this diet had turned the skin around her mouth permanently black. The woman chosen as the sacrificial victim was forced to smile at all times and was severely beaten by the other women guarding her if she cried because it was felt that her tears would spoil the ceremony as it was believed that every tear would cause a stillbirth or the death of a warrior in battle in the next year.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. By contrast, the rain god Tlaloc required the sacrifice of children to honor him, and it was believed that the tears of the doomed children would ensure rain in the coming year, so the Mexica went to great lengths to have the children destined to die for Tlaloc to cry as much as possible before their hearts were ripped out.Windshuttle, Keith The Killing of History, San Francisco: Encounter Books, 1997 page 67. The Australian historian Inga Clendinnen wrote that the young woman chosen as the sacrifice victim must had been in a state close to \\"hysteria\\" as she knew when the night came on the fifth day, she would die while being forced to smile all the time at the prospect.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. On the fifth day to honor the Toci, the young woman was marched through the streets of Tenochtitlan surrounded by other women, spreading maize and flowers before being taken in the evening to the temple of the Maize Lord.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. Joining the woman chosen to die on her last day were men dressed in the style of the Huaxteca people living on the Gulf coast, whom the Mexica despised as cowardly warriors, but whom were widely admired as the Huaxteca men were reputably the most well endowed men in Mexico and were famed as great lovers.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 77. The young woman wore a dress of maguey fiber, which she herself had woven and which she sold on the last day of her life in the marketplace.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 77. To calm the girl down, she was told by the other women that she would not be sacrificed, but instead would have sex with the Tlatoani (emperor) in public on top of the pyramid.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 77. At the pyramid, she was laid on a slab facing the sky, had her mouth bound so she could not scream and she was sacrificed by having her head slowly sawed off by using an obsidian knife as she was laid there bound, staring upwards at the stars, so the crops might grow in the next season.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. The sacrifice of the women recalled the story about how Toci came to be, when Actitometl, the leader of the Culhua people had given his daughter in marriage to the Mexica leader, who promptly sacrificed her to Huitzilopochtli, the god of war, becoming Toci in the moment of her death.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 77. Clendinnen described what happened next: > \\"Then, still in darkness, silence, and urgent haste, her body was flayed, > and a naked priest, a 'very strong man, very powerful, very tall', struggled > into the wet skin, with its slack breasts and pouched genitalia: a double > nakedness of layered, ambiguous sexuality. The skin of one thigh was > reserved to be fashioned into a face-mask for the man impersonating > Centeotl, Young Lord Maize Cob, the son of Toci\\".Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An > Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. At that point, the priest wearing the bloody skin of the victim become Toci, and was seen as a \\"woman\\", always being addressed as she and her.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. The man seen as \\"Toci\\" was followed by four barely dressed, well endowed young men wearing tight loincloths so that their erect penises would be all too visible while wearing cotton blossoms and carrying spindles, symbols of femininity in Mexica culture, which were meant to emphasize the ambiguous sexuality of the gods who could be either male, female or change sex as the circumstances required.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 pages 202 & 204. Xilonen, the goddess of maize changed sex over the course of the growing season, becoming Centeotl, the Maize Lord.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 pages 202 & 204. Maize in its early stages was slender with long hair and had milky kernels whose shapes reminded the Mexica of breasts, all suggestive of a woman's body while its later stages it was hard, erect, and phallic shaped which the Mexica explained was due to Xilonen, the Maize Lady becoming Centeotl, the Maize Lord.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 204. As the maize was harvested, Centeotl was \\"castrated\\" by the cutting of the phallic shaped maize, causing him to turn back into the maiden Xilonen.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 204. Clendinnen described pictures of the four young men wearing Huaxteca hats (the Huaxteca were legendary in Mexico for their erotic skills) as having \\"glorious erections\\", evoking a very masculine and sexualized imaginary despite being dressed in mostly feminine style.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 202 . Despite the fact that the men were wore the conical Huaxteca hats, the Mexica detested the Huaxteca. In 1487, the Huaxteca revolted against their overlords, leading the Mexica to launch a genocidal war against the Huaxteca, with every captured Huaxteca being marched back to Tenochtitlan..Windshuttle, Keith The Killing of History, San Francisco: Encounter Books, 1997 pages 67-68. Mexica accounts boast that over four days, 80, 000 Huaxteca men, women and children were killed to celebrate the opening of the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan and the Huaxteca were no more, through Clendinnen cautioned that 20, 000 killed is more a realistic number.Windshuttle, Keith The Killing of History, San Francisco: Encounter Books, 1997 page 68. At the foot of the pyramid, the chief priest and warriors greeted \\"Toci\\" and \\"her\\" four young men, and would flee in mock terror as \\"Toci\\" and company would sweep the streets on their way to the Great Pyramid.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 202. The mock-terror of the warriors was all the more remarkable as a popular Mexica poem had boasted that \\"Here no one fears to die in war\\" as the aggressively militaristic Mexica loathed cowardice and to die in battle was the highest honor for a man, which indicated the fear the Mexica had for \\"Our Grandmother\\".Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 79. At the Great Pyramid, \\"Toci\\" together with the man wearing the mask made of human skin playing the Maize Lord were taken to the top of the Great Pyramid to sit on \\"her\\" throne with \\"her son\\" sitting next to her, where in the morning they greeted the priests as they arrived at the Great Pyramid.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 201. To honor \\"her\\" arrival, a number of prisoners of war were crucified at the foot of the temple and were killed by warriors shooting arrows at them.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 78. Blood from the victims was collected in a bowl to be given to \\"Toci\\", who drank some of it, and then began to growl terribly, reflecting her displeasure with the sacrifice, as Toci could never have enough cruelty to satisfy her blood-lust.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 78. Toci was greeted by a man dressed as Huitzilopochtli, her husband, and the two would engage in sexual gestures, to symbolize the \\"divine sexual union\\" that took place after Toci had been sacrificed, becoming a goddess who married Huitzilopochtli.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 78. Upon being seated at the top of the temple, the priests would crown \\"Toci\\" with a crown made of paper.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 78. The priests would dress \\"Toci\\" with make-up, feathers and a dress, and once properly dressed, \\"Toci\\" would sacrifice four male prisoners brought before \\"her\\" by cutting out their hearts with an obsidian knife.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 202. \\"Toci\\" would then retire while man playing Centeotl, the Maize Lord would appear at the front of the Great Pyramid to review a parade of warriors marching before him.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 pages 201-202. The face mask of human skin was then sent out as a challenge for another people, for Ochpaniztli was always the beginning of the season of war.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 203. After receiving weapons from the ruler, the warriors would sing and dance around the Great Pyramid while the women of Tenochtitlan would engage in much wailing at the prospect that their sons would die in the wars to come.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 203. At the end of the dancing and singing, priests would emerge from the Great Pyramid wearing the skin of other victims to throw maize seeds at the people.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 203. The Fire Priest of Huitzilopochtli would then set out a bowel full of chalk and feathers (symbols of death) at the top of the Great Pyramid while the warriors would charge up to toss around and smear the chalk and feathers upon themselves, showing their willingness to die in battle.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 pages 203-204. \\"Toci\\" or \\"our grandmother\\" as the Mexica also called her would reemerge from the Great Pyramid and again the warriors would flee in mock terror from her.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 204. For the Mexica, sex and war were closely linked; sex led to children, which made it possible for boys to grow up to become the warriors who would fight the wars of the next generation and childbirth itself was the \\"battle\\" that every women had to fight.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 79. The purpose of the Mexica Triple Alliance of states on the shores of Lake Texcoco was to fight wars, to take prisoners who would be sacrificed as the Mexica believed that the gods would not allow the sun to rise everyday unless they were given human flesh to eat the day before, thus requiring daily sacrifices at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan and endless wars to supply the victims to die at the Great Pyramid. Sometimes, the warriors ran in mock terror to the edge of Tenochtitlan, where they may have engaged in mock battles with other warriors or may have actually raided the territories of other people, engaging in real battles.Harris, Max Aztecs, Moors, and Christians: Festivals of Reconquest in Mexico and Spain, Austin: University of Texas, 2000 page 79. \\"Toci\\" then marched through the streets of Tenochtitlan to the edge of the city, where the priest would become \\"male\\" again by removing the skin of the young woman, which then stretched over a wooden platform to face visitors to Tenochtitlan.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 204. As \\"Toci\\" removed her skin, it symbolized the change in personality of \\"our grandmother\\" from the kindly goddess of healing and health to her real nature, the merciless goddess of war, the eater of men who could never have enough blood to drink and human flesh to devour.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 204. In Mexica myth, during their wanderings, the ruler of Culhua had offered up his daughter, a gentle princess in marriage to one of the Mexica leaders, but Huitzilopochtli, the god of war and the sun ordered her skinned alive and sacrificed instead; the once gentle and kind princess transformed at the moment of her death into Toci, \\"our grandmother\\", the wrathful goddess of war.Blake, Debra Chicana Sexuality and Gender: Cultural Refiguring in Literature, Oral History, and Art, Durham: Duke University Press, 2009 pages 28-29. Toci's savage, fierce hatred of humanity stemmed from her anger at being skinned alive and sacrificed during her last hours as a human, which explained her insatiable blood-lust and her cruelty, making her into the \\"woman of discord\\" as Huitzilopochtli wanted.Blake, Debra Chicana Sexuality and Gender: Cultural Refiguring in Literature, Oral History, and Art, Durham: Duke University Press, 2009 pages 28-29. Hutzilopochtli promptly married Toci, as her blood-thirstiness and cruelty made her into the ideal wife for him.Blake, Debra Chicana Sexuality and Gender: Cultural Refiguring in Literature, Oral History, and Art, Durham: Duke University Press, 2009 pages 28-29. Sexual differences were key to the Mexica understanding of the universe, where male and female counterbalanced each other to achieve order in the cosmos.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 207. However, in the Mexica understanding of the world, the male body only become sacred after men were \\"made\\" into warriors via training and battle while the female body, capable of bearing life, was sacred in and of itself.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 207. Priests as men achieved their position through constant training while when the priests become \\"priestess\\" when draped in the body of a woman become powerful in and of themselves as the female body was always viewed as innately sacred.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 207. Mexica society was a patriarchal one and war was a masculine activity.Blake, Debra Chicana Sexuality and Gender: Cultural Refiguring in Literature, Oral History, and Art, Durham: Duke University Press, 2009 page 28 . However, the appeal of female sexuality gave women a certain power over men, and thus women who always considered trouble-makers in Mexica society, which was full of stories of women using the appeal of their sexuality to manipulate men, and in the process causing much trouble.Blake, Debra Chicana Sexuality and Gender: Cultural Refiguring in Literature, Oral History, and Art, Durham: Duke University Press, 2009 pages 28-29. Given this view of women, it is no accident that one of the chief deities of war was Toci, the \\"Woman of Discord\\", who symbolized the troublesome appeal of female sexuality as a disputative force.Blake, Debra Chicana Sexuality and Gender: Cultural Refiguring in Literature, Oral History, and Art, Durham: Duke University Press, 2009 page 28. The sacrifices of the young people were done publicly and were always the cause of great celebration and joy among the Mexica who believed the Maize Lord would reward them with a good harvest in the coming year.Clendinnen, Inga Aztecs: An Interpretation, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1995 page 204. The Australian historian Keith Windschuttle has used holidays like Ochpaniztli as part of his indictment of multiculturalism, which argues that all cultures are of equal value. Windschuttle has argued under multiculturalism, the bloodthirsty culture of the Mexica must be considered equal with Western culture, a position that Windschuttle rejects as he argued that Mexica culture was \\"so perverted and alien to all the natural springs of life that its people indeed justify the label of \\"The Other\\", and was the Spanish conquest of Mexico, which resulted in the destruction of Mexica culture, should not be condemned by historians.Windshuttle, Keith The Killing of History, San Francisco : Encounter Books, 1997 page 69.

On 23 May 1971, the Tupolev Tu-134A servicing the flight suffered structural failure during landing. The aircraft flipped over and caught fire, killing 78 people. The crash became the first accident of the Tupolev Tu-134 since entering service. British authorities assisted in the investigation, and found that the crew might have suffered an optical illusion due to heavy rains, from which they thought the runway was closer than it was. This may have caused a premature descent. Aircraft The accident aircraft had serial number 1351205. It had accumulated a total of only 111 airframe hours at the time of the crash. The plane was imported to Yugoslavia on 23 April 1971, and an airworthiness certificate was issued on 27 April. Passengers and Crew There were 76 passengers and 7 crew members on board Flight 130. The flight was transporting British tourists traveling on holiday to Rijeka, the third-largest city in Croatia. Seventy-two passengers were British tourists, while the others were Yugoslav. Among the passengers was Croatian poet Josip Pupaƒçiƒá, travelling with his wife and daughter; all 3 perished in the crash. The captain of the flight was 41-year-old Milo≈° Markiƒáeviƒá. He held an IFR rating, and had 9,230 flight hours, 138 of which were on the Tupolev Tu-134A. The co-pilot was 34-year-old Stevan Mandiƒá. He had 2,300 flight hours, with 899 hours in type. A trainee, Viktor Tomiƒá, had 99 flight hours. He was supervised by 39-year-old flight engineer Ivan ƒåavajda, who had accumulated 7,500 flight hours, of which 1,373 were on the Tu-134. The cabin crew consisted of flight attendants Alma Svoboda, Mira Mi≈°e and Mirjana Jankoviƒá. Crash The aircraft took off from Gatwick at 16:33 GMT. The flight proceeded normally until approach to Rijeka Airport. The crew followed the ILS with a slightly increased speed. Four kilometers from the runway threshold, at an altitude of about , the aircraft entered torrential rain. The crew immediately activated the windshield wipers. Fifty seconds before touchdown, the aircraft lifted upwards and rolled to the right. Due to the challenging conditions, the crew could not return to the ILS approach, but managed to align the aircraft with the runway. However, the aircraft remained above its proper glide path while the crew tried to reduce speed with the elevators and by reducing thrust. At 800 m from the runway, power was reduced to idle, and the elevators were deployed. The aircraft then entered a gradually steepening angle of descent. Due to a likely optical illusion, the crew thought they were closer to the runway and at a higher altitude than they actually were. The aircraft hit the ground at 140 knots (260 km/h). The right wing detached, and the aircraft then flipped over and burst into flames. All passengers and crew survived the initial impact. A fire then started in the left wing and tail. Thick smoke immediately entered the cabin. Panicked passengers then attempted to evacuate from the burning wreckage. They had difficulties due to lack of visibility; the electrical supply cut off immediately after impact, and thick smoke and darkness worsened matters. One group of passengers was ordered to see if any could be evacuated through the rear portion of the plane, while another was ordered to check the front of the cabin. Both groups realized the doors in the rear and front could not be opened due to the severity of the impact. As the fire intensified, passengers tried to break the windows of the cabin with an axe. This worsened the situation, as air was allowed to enter the cabin, intensifying the fire. The cabin crew could only move the passengers to the front of the fuselage. The four pilots evacuated through the right window of the cockpit. The flight engineer of the flight, ƒåavajda, had first attempted to help the passengers and cabin crew evacuate, but was unable to, as the cockpit door would not open. Rescue services arrived minutes after the crash. Their attempts to extinguish the flames were hindered by the rainy conditions, which washed away the fire-smothering foam. Strong winds worsened the situation. The wind was also blowing in a direction from the tail to the nose, further slowing the rescue operation. The cabin crew and passengers managed to partially open the forward service door, but by that time the smoke was too thick, and most of the passengers and cabin crews had succumbed to carbon monoxide poisoning. One passenger (the only one to survive), Ranko Sarajƒçiƒá, managed to evacuate through an opening in the rear portion of the plane. Sarajƒçiƒá had told others to follow him. However, due to panic, none did. Twelve minutes after the crash, the cabin fire contacted the oxygen supply, causing a massive explosion in the front of the aircraft. Any passengers still alive were killed from the resulting conflagration. According to investigators, at least 30% of the dead were found with their seat belts still fastened. Investigation The accident was investigated by the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch. A report was released on 1 December 1973. It found that, as Flight 130 flew through the rain, refraction of light on the cockpit windshield caused an illusion that made the runway seem closer than it actually was. This could have caused the crew to think that the runway was 200 ft (60 meters) lower than it actually was. The illusion caused the crew to apply a nose down input and reduce power to flight idle when the aircraft was 800 meters from the runway. The nose down input caused the aircraft to reach an airspeed of 310 km/h. As the plane contacted the ground at 260 km/h, it broke up and burst into flames. The AAIB issued a recommendation that pilots study illusions that could be encountered during landing in heavy rain.

Route description Going from south to north, US 67 enters Missouri at the Arkansas state line. About north of the state line, it intersects US 160. At the southwest corner of Poplar Bluff, Business Route 67 goes into Poplar Bluff while US 67 bypasses Poplar Bluff to the west on a freeway-grade highway. It then joins US 60 at the northwest corner of Poplar Bluff. Both 60 and 67 then follow a four-lane route to an interchange about northwest of Poplar Bluff, where US 60 heads west toward Springfield while US 67 heads north to St. Louis. Construction is complete to divide the highway through Wayne, Madison and Butler Counties, including bypasses around Greenville and Cherokee Pass. The new divided highway opened on August 19, 2011, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Additionally, MoDOT has extended the divided highway south to US 160 south of Poplar Bluff. From Fredericktown, US 67 passes through Farmington, where an existing interchange with Route 221 was converted to a diverging diamond interchange in September 2012. US 67 then proceeds through Park Hills, Desloge, and Bonne Terre. About north of Bonne Terre, US 67 crosses Interstate 55 and enters Festus and Crystal City and picks up US 61. This becomes known as Truman Boulevard in Festus and Crystal City, Highway 61-67 from Herculaneum to Imperial, and Jeffco Boulevard from Arnold until it exits Jefferson County and enters St. Louis County, where it becomes Lemay Ferry Road. = St. Louis County = When US 67/61 reaches St. Louis County, It travels Lemay Ferry Road (Route 267) until it reaches Lindbergh Boulevard. There it travels Lindbergh Boulevard (known as Kirkwood Road in Kirkwood). US 61 then turns west onto I-64/US 40 West towards Wentzville. Lindbergh, named for aviator Charles Lindbergh, continues north through Frontenac, Ladue, Creve Coeur, Maryland Heights, Bridgeton, Hazelwood and Florissant until it reaches Lewis & Clark Boulevard (Route 367). From there, it continues straight north to West Alton, Missouri and then crosses the Mississippi River on the Clark Bridge and enters Alton, Illinois. The only vehicular tunnel in Missouri is located on US 67 at Lambert-St. Louis International Airport, where the road tunnels under the runway. History The northern terminus was at Alt. US 61 near Fredericktown, Missouri, in 1926. The route was extended north on Illinois Route 3 (through western Illinois) to its northern terminus in Rock Island, Illinois by 1932 . Sometime after 1940, US 67 was routed into Madison County. Then, it was co-signed with Route 66 as both routes went across the McKinley Bridge. By the mid-1940s, US 67 had been rerouted from St. Louis to Alton via the Lewis Bridge over the Missouri River and the Clark Bridge (formerly the Old Clark Bridge) over the Mississippi River. The Alton to Jerseyville section now passed through Godfrey and Delhi. By the mid-1950s, a more direct route for US 67 from Godfrey to Jacksonville via Greenfield had opened. Heading north from Downtown Alton, US 67 was rerouted via an abandoned railroad grade to the north end of town. Between Fort Bellefontaine, Missouri (near Lewis Bridge) and south of St. Louis, US 67 followed two different routes. US 67 originally followed Lewis and Clark Boulevard, Florissant Avenue, 7th Street, and Broadway south through St. Louis. US 67 Bypass followed Lindbergh Boulevard around the city. Route 99 was an inner bypass within the city limits, following Kingshighway Boulevard and Riverview Boulevard between Route 30 (Gravois Road) and US 67 (Florissant Avenue). US 67 replaced Route 99 in the mid-1950s, using Loughborough Avenue at the south end, and the old route south of downtown became an extension of US 67 Alternate, which had begun downtown and crossed into Illinois towards Alton. (The old US 67 north of downtown was mostly US 66 City.) Later, in the late 1960s, US 67 moved to the bypass, and the old route, where not turned back to the city, became Route 267 and Route 367. In 1964, US 67A was replaced by Route 3, as St. Louis started to decommission 'alternate' and 'bypass' US routes. A new four-lane Route 3 opened a few years later. Future The portion of US 67 between the Arkansas state line and Poplar Bluff is slated to be upgraded into an extension of Interstate 57. US 67 between Poplar Bluff and Route 158 is already mostly a freeway with only two at-grade intersections. Planning is underway to build the next ten miles of freeway between Route 158 and County Road 274 south of Neelyville, just 2 miles north of the Arkansas border. However, it is currently unclear as to when and where exactly the highway will tie into the Arkansas side, as the Arkansas Department of Transportation has not yet determined a route to finish their portion of the US 67 freeway.

Career Paul Bonner illustrated the covers of the World of Lone Wolf series of gamebooks, including Grey Star the Wizard, The Forbidden City, Beyond the Nightmare Gate, and War of the Wizards. His portfolio includes Games Workshop, FASA Corporation, Riotminds and Rackham. He has also illustrated several book covers, and a pair of posters for long- standing works in the fantasy genre (Tolkien and Lloyd Alexander). In 2008 his first collection of artwork 'Out of the Forests' was published. While not all- inclusive, it contained a sampling of most of his major projects. Bonner's work has also appeared numerous times in the yearly Spectrum art books. His work for Dungeons & Dragons includes cover art for the adventures Die Vecna Die! and Into the Dragon's Lair. Bonner's art work is notable for its use of vivid colors, contrast, and somewhat exaggerated features. Practically none of his work contains elves either, though most other 'standard' races are frequent. While typically depicting scenes of violence, few of his works actually show blood.

Nelle Richmond Eberhart (August 28, 1871 ‚Äì November 15, 1944) was an American librettist, poet, and teacher. She is known for her long collaboration with composer Charles Wakefield Cadman; she wrote 200 songs and the librettos for five operas for which he composed the music.  Early life  Eberhart was born Ellen Loretta McCurdy in 1871 in Detroit, Michigan, daughter of John Thomas and Cora Amelia Newton McCurdy.\\"Nelle Richmond Eberhart\\" entry, Durward Howes, American Women (R. Blank Company, 1935): p. 258. Her mother remarried. At an early age, Nelle was given her stepfather's surname, Richmond. She was raised with her family in Nebraska. There she taught school as a young woman and had a strong interest in music. In 1894 Richmond married Oscar Eberhart, a physician. They had a daughter together, Constance Richmond Eberhart, who became an opera singer and teacher of voice. She sang as a member of the Chicago Civic Opera and the American Opera Company.Alouine Goodjohn Wu, Constance Eberhart: A Musical Career in the Age of Cadman (National Opera Association, 1983).  Career  The Eberhart family moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1900 for her husband's work. Beginning in 1902, Eberhart met her young neighbor Charles Wakefield Cadman. When she learned he was studying and writing music, they began to work together. She wrote the words for a hymn and he the music, for their first song.Mabel Ansley Murphy, \\"From Railroad Clerk to Grand Opera Composer\\", The American Magazine Vol. 89, Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, 1920, pp. 69-70 They began to collaborate - she would write the texts and he the music for songs. She wrote the lyrics for some 200 songs and the librettos for the five operas that they created together. His \\"Four American Indian Songs Op. 45\\" (which included \\"From the Land of Sky-Blue Water\\") was his first commercial success in 1909, after the noted soprano Nordica performed the song in Cleveland. Their first opera, Da O Ma (1912), set in Sioux culture, was never produced. But their second opera Shanewis, or The Robin Woman (1918) was premiered by the Metropolitan Opera in New York City and performed there for a second, succeeding season. Eberhart was the first woman librettist to have her work performed by that company. The opera was taken on tour, being produced in Denver in 1924 and Los Angeles in 1926. Eberhart wrote the libretto for Garden of Mystery, music by Cadman, which was performed in 1925 at Carnegie Hall in New York. Later, she wrote The Willow Tree (1932, music by Cadman), one of the first operas commissioned for radio, certainly the first for American radio.Finding Aid, Nelle Richmond Eberhart Papers, 1894-1943, New York Public Library. In addition to her emphasis on Native American themes, Eberhart also showed interest in Asian and Pacific Island themes, writing lyrics for \\"Sayonara: A Japanese Romance for One or Two Voices, op. 49,\\" and \\"Idyls of the South Seas\\" (music by Cadman). Her interest in historical drama inspired their A Witch of Salem: An American Opera [1926], music by Cadman. She also wrote several Christian hymns (\\"The Dawn of Peace Resplendent Breaks,\\" \\"Give Praise,\\" \\"O Come and Adore Him\\"),Virginia L.

Located in the northern section of the park, Crooked Thumb Peak is in the Picket Range and is south of Mount Challenger and the same distance north of Phantom Peak. Climate Crooked Thumb is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

He played in two NCAA Final Fours during his career at Butler, as well as professionally for Nept≈´nas. Smith grew up in the Indianapolis, Indiana, area. He attended Covenant Christian High School where he became a star basketball player. During his senior year, he led the state of Indiana in rebounding, was named All-City player of the year, and was selected as a National Christian Schools Athletic Association All-American. After high school, Smith accepted a scholarship offer to play basketball at Butler. At Butler, Smith was a reserve during his freshman year. Despite playing just three minutes during the previous month, he came into Butler's Elite Eight game against Kansas State and played a significant role in helping the school to its first ever Final Four appearance. Smith became a starter shortly after the start of his sophomore year and his emergence as a starter helped Butler return to the Final Four. During Smith's junior year, he led the team in scoring and made more than 52% of his shot attempts. He also expanded his game to include 3-point shooting. As a senior, Smith became a vocal leader for Butler and led the team in rebounding. Butler returned to the NCAA tournament where Smith recorded a career high and Butler tournament record 16 rebounds against Bucknell in a second-round match. Smith was selected as an Academic All-American and Senior CLASS Award recipient. He finished his college career with more than 1000 rebounds and 100 wins, one of just three Butler players to achieve the feat. He married his long-time girlfriend shortly after graduating from Butler with a degree in finance. Andrew Smith died from cancer at the age of 25. Early life Andrew Smith was born September 9, 1990 in Washington, D.C. Even at birth, Smith was big, measuring long, about above average. Smith's father, Curt, worked for Senator Dan Coats at the time before returning to his native Indiana when Andrew was a young boy. Curt was a high school basketball player for Pike High School, and was involved with basketball throughout Andrew's youth. Andrew Smith grew up in Zionsville, Indiana. By the time he started high school at Covenant Christian, a small school of 300 students in Indianapolis, he stood at . His coach, Scott Flatt, called Smith \\"a freak\\" of nature because he had enough mobility to guard multiple positions despite his size. During his junior year, he averaged 14.5 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 2.8 blocked shots per game. Over the summer, he scored 28 points in game against top-tier AAU team The Family. Afterwards, recruiting picked up dramatically. Smith accepted an offer from Butler, where his mother was working at the time. He said that as soon as Butler became interested in him, he knew that was where he was going to play his college basketball. \\"It's like a perfect fit for me,\\" he said. During his senior year, Smith missed half the season with a stress fracture. Even so, he was named Indianapolis Star All-City Player of the Year and was named to the National Christian Schools Athletic Association (NCSAA) Super Regional Team. He led Covenant Christian to a Class 2A sectional championship, and led the state in rebounding (17.1 per game). He averaged 23.3 points, marking his third straight year of averaging a double-double, and blocked 2.3 shots per game. He was an honorable mention for the All-State team and was a second team NCSAA All-American. After his senior season, Smith was selected to participate in the Hoosier Basketball Top 60 Senior Boys Workout. He played in the North‚ÄìSouth Indiana All-Star Classic and the Hoosiers' Reunion All-Star Classic. College Smith attended Butler for college. During the 2009‚Äì10 season, his freshman year, he was a reserve, playing in 24 games. In an Elite Eight match against Kansas State, Smith was inserted into the lineup when Matt Howard got into early foul trouble. He played five minutes in the first half, helping Butler build an 18‚Äì10 lead. Smith also played in the second half, finishing with a season-high 12 minutes. Over the previous month, he had played just three minutes in total. With Smith's help, Butler advanced to the school's first ever Final Four, which happened to be in Indianapolis. At the end of his Butler career, Smith said the Kansas State game was his favorite memory of Butler. Butler ended up making it the NCAA Championship Game. During his sophomore year, Smith played in all 38 games, starting 32. After Butler got off to a mediocre 3‚Äì2 start, Smith was added to the starting lineup. Against Cleveland State, he scored a career-high 22 points and collected 10 rebounds to get his first collegiate double-double. In the final game of the regular season, he played a career-high 36 minutes and recorded 11 rebounds, 3 steals, and 3 blocks, all career highs. Thanks in large part to Smith's emergence as a starter, Butler returned to the NCAA Tournament. During the round of 32, Smith hit a go-ahead basket with less than 3 seconds on the clock to help Butler beat top seeded Pittsburgh. In Butler's sweet 16 match against Wisconsin, Smith hurt his ankle and left the game. However, he returned before the game's end, collecting eight points and six rebounds as Butler advanced to the regional final. Butler again advanced to the Championship game. Smith led the team in rebounding in the regional final against Florida and in the National Championship game against Connecticut. He finished the year as the team's second-leading rebounder (5.6 per game) and third-leading scorer (8.5). He made 59.3% of his field goal attempts and 67.3% of his free throws. Andrew Smith (left, dark uniform) battles Connecticut's Alex Oriakhi for the opening tip during the 2011 National Championship Game. Following the graduation of Howard and the early departure of Shelvin Mack to play in the NBA, Butler struggled during Smith's junior year. Smith, however, continued to put up solid numbers. He recorded two double-doubles, one against Chattanooga and one against Oakland City, and had a game-winning tip-in shot against Purdue. At Loyola, he grabbed a career-high 13 rebounds. At Milwaukee, he recorded four assists and four steals, both career highs. In the first round of the Horizon League tournament, Smith scored a career high 25 points, hitting a career best 12 of 14 free throws, and recording 7 rebounds. Butler failed to make the NCAA Tournament, instead playing in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI). In the semi-finals of the CBI, Smith scored 19 points and grabbed 6 rebounds. For the season, he led the team in scoring with 10.9 points per game. He emerged as a 3-point field goal threat, making 19 of 54 attempts after attempting just one 3-pointer the previous year. Overall, Smith made 52.5% of his field goal attempts and 64.3% of his free throws. During the off-season, head coach Brad Stevens asked Smith to take on a new role ‚Äì vocal leader. The role did not fit Smith's natural personality, but he embraced it nonetheless. Entering the 2012‚Äì13 season, Smith was the only active college player who had played in two Final Fours. He started 35 games during the year, sitting out one game with an injury. Facing reigning Atlantic 10 Defensive Player of the year, St. Joseph's C. J. Aiken, Smith scored 24 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. He also recorded double-doubles at Northwestern and at Massachusetts. For the week of January 14, he was named as the Atlantic 10 Player of the Week for his part in back- to-back road victories. At Massachusetts on March 7, Smith became the 11th player in Butler history to surpass 1,000 points and 600 rebounds. In the lone game he missed, Butler was upset at home by Charlotte, underscoring Smith's importance to the team. Butler returned to the NCAA tournament, and Smith recorded 14 points and 16 rebounds against Bucknell in the round of 64. The 16 rebounds represented both a career-high for Smith and a Butler tournament record. In the round of 32, he scored 17 and grabbed a game-high eight rebounds. With Butler trailing by two in the final seconds, Smith got the ball to attempt a game winning three but stumbled and did not get off a good shot. Smith led the team in rebounding for the season (6.1 per game) and led Butler in rebounding 13 times. He was second in scoring, averaging 11.3 points. He made 49.6% of his shot attempts and 71.8% of his free throws. Defensively, Smith had strong games against future NBA players Cody Zeller, Kelly Olynyk, and Mike Muscala. He was named to the Atlantic 10 All-Academic Team, and was selected as a second team Academic All-American. He was also a second team Senior CLASS Award selection, recognizing his achievement in athletic competition, character, academics, and community involvement. Smith finished his Butler career 5th all-time on the schools list of games played (134), 12th in rebounding (648), and 25th in points scored (1,147). He played in 11 NCAA tournament games, tied for 6th on Butler's all-time list. He scored 73 points in those games, good enough for fifth place all-time, and grabbed 65 rebounds, the second most ever. Smith is just one of three Butler players, along with Howard and Joel Cornette, to amass more than 100 wins and more than 1,000 points in his career. Smith called his Butler experience \\"as good as it gets\\" and remarked \\"I know that I've received a great education to help me in the future and obviously I've had a great basketball career with the success that we've had. It's kind of been a win-win for me and I really have a lot of great opportunities coming out of school.\\" He added that the experience prepared him well for a pro career: \\"we played just about every single good team you can in my four years there. We contended with just about all of them. [So, ] I know I can play\\". Smith had finished his Butler classes by February 2013. In between finishing classes and graduation in May, he interned at the Butler Business Accelerator, consulting with pharmaceutical and financial service businesses. Previously, he interned with a venture capital firm during the summer of 2012. Smith graduated in May with a degree in finance. Professional career Andrew Smith (front, dark uniform) anticipates the rebound in a game against Siena on November 23, 2010. Smith participated in the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, a post-season tournament for NBA prospects, Smith averaged 5.3 points and 6.7 rebounds. Prior to the NBA Draft, Smith trained at the St. Vincent Sports Performance Center in Indianapolis, working with former teammates Matt Howard and Gordon Hayward. He said he was concentrating on improving his mid-range game, which he rarely used in college. Smith worked out for six NBA teams, including the Indiana Pacers twice. He was not expected to be drafted, but received offers to play for the Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder teams. When he was not drafted, he took the Thunder's offer, playing on their 2013 Summer team. On September 1, 2013, the Lithuanian club Nept≈´nas announced that they had signed Smith for the 2013‚Äì14 season. =Skill set= Smith was listed as tall, weighing . He was a competent 3-point shooter and rarely dunked the ball, both rare traits for a center. Personal life =Cancer and death= Smith's basketball career prematurely ended in January 2014. After noticing a suspicious bump on his neck, he began having increasing difficulty breathing. Initially, it was determined that he did not have cancer, but a later MRI scan revealed a suspected cancerous tumor in one of his lungs, and he returned to the U.S. Doctors in Indianapolis initially determined he was suffering from non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and soon made a more specific diagnosis of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. This type of cancer, normally found in children, has a 50-50 survival rate for that age group, but is less survivable for adults. He immediately went on a chemotherapy regimen that had to be specially calibrated for his unusually large frame. While undergoing treatment, he took a job with a leasing and financing company owned by family friends. On July 31, 2014, on his third day on the job, Smith collapsed at his office in a building next to Indianapolis International Airport and went into cardiac arrest for more than 22 minutes before being revived and rushed to a nearby hospital. He was immediately placed into a medically induced coma, and awoke four days later. While doctors would not officially link the cardiac arrest with his cancer battle, both Smith's wife and father believe the two were related. By December of that year, he had completed his final chemotherapy treatment, and went under what is called \\"maintenance\\" treatment, in which he continued to take several medications. While he had yet to fully regain his strength, he had not suffered any apparent neurological damage from his prolonged cardiac arrest. In a 2015 article on Smith's struggles, CBS Sports journalist Matt Norlander said, \\"The fact Andrew left the hospital with full control of his faculties barely a week later -- and has not suffered any setbacks -- is supernatural.\\" He received a bone marrow transplant in November 2015, but his condition worsened; his wife reported in a December 2015 post to their blog that the lymphoma had become an aggressive leukemia. He remained hospitalized until shortly before Christmas, when he was released to spend the holiday at home. Smith's condition worsened again in early January 2016 and he was readmitted to the hospital. Stevens, now the head coach of the Boston Celtics, missed a January 7 game against the Chicago Bulls to visit with Smith, who was reportedly scheduled to receive a second bone marrow transplant that day. Three days later, Smith's wife posted on their blog that he was near death, saying, \\"The doctors tell me death is imminent and that Andrew is going to die from this disease. There are no treatments, no clinical trials...there is nothing left to do.\\" Smith died in his sleep on January 12, 2016 at the age of 25. Following his death, the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) named him and his widow as recipients of the 2016 men's version of its Most Courageous Award. The USBWA specifically cited their public battle with cancer and advocacy for bone marrow registry; during his memorial service, the Smith family set up a table in the church lobby to sign up marrow donors. =Family= Smith's father, Curt, is the president of the Indiana Family Institute. Smith's mother, Debbie, worked as an administrative assistant for Butler University before retiring. Andrew Smith has three siblings: an older brother, Stephen, an older sister Julie, and a younger sister Kimberly. He is distantly related to former Butler player Pete Campbell. Smith's best friend in high school, soccer player Blake Leyden, was his roommate at Butler. On May 18, 2013, Smith married his longtime girlfriend Samantha (n√©e Stage). Stage met Smith through her best friend and Smith's sister, Kimberly. Like Smith, she has a competitive personality and is involved in sports. She played volleyball and tennis in high school. Stage is just tall, leading to numerous funny photo opportunities. For example, at prom, Smith danced with Stage on his knees. While Smith was at Butler, Stage worked as a nanny and took online classes in psychology. Smith was called a \\"goofball\\" and was a self-described introvert. \\"He is constantly making me laugh,\\" said Stage. Smith said that would have liked to have six children if he and his wife became financially stable. Following his health crisis in 2014, Smith's coach at Butler, Brad Stevens, said about Smith and his wife, > It's miraculous. It's an absolute miracle. There is no other way to > interpret this. They've been through more in a 20-month marriage than a lot > of people go through in the first 20 years. I was amazed. He amazes me every > time I talk to him. When he got to Butler he was a really bright guy trying > to find his way playing basketball. He became one of the most confident, > toughest, hardest-working players I've ever coached. And Sam is an absolute > rock. Smith then returned to the job he held before his cardiac arrest, and coached in a church-based youth basketball league. In Norlander's piece, he also briefly discussed his Christian faith, saying, > I'm not on this earth to go out and play basketball games. I'm on this earth > to share a story people can hear ... Our faith gives everything that > happened last year a purpose. ... If I was going to bring one person back > from a dark place, and we've had hundreds and hundreds of letters, then this > entire year was worth it.

At the orphanage, the twins were named Vanya Skorobogatov and Dasha, but the biological parents of the children have not been established.–î–µ–ª–æ –æ –≥–∏–±–µ–ª–∏ –≤ –°–®–ê —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ –º–∞–ª—å—á–∏–∫–∞ –í–∞–Ω–∏ –°–∫–æ—Ä–æ–±–æ–≥–∞—Ç–æ–≤–∞. –°–ø—Ä–∞–≤–∫–∞ –†–ò–ê –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –æ—Ç 18/11/2011. Nathaniel reportedly suffered from fetal alcohol syndrome and reactive attachment disorder. According to his adoptive parents, these conditions led Nathaniel to self-injure. Two years prior to Nathaniel's death, he and his twin sister were removed from the Cravers' custody while they were investigated by child and youth workers. Documents released by the authorities indicate that the Cravers began homeschooling the children and no further visits from child and youth workers were conducted. Hospitalization and death On the morning of August 20, 2009, Michael Craver arrived at Geisinger Holy Spirit with an unresponsive Nathaniel, claiming that he discovered the boy in that state in his bed. The Cravers claimed that Nathaniel had intentionally thrown himself into a wood burning stove the night before and that he had been fine when he was put to bed. An emergency room nurse who treated Nathaniel commented that the boy's head felt \\"like a wet sponge\\" and that he was covered in bruises at different stages of healing. The boy was transferred to Hershey Medical Center where attempts were made in vain to intervene by relieving the pressure on his brain, but he failed to regain consciousness. Nathaniel's adoptive parents chose to take him off life support on August 24, 2009. On August 25, 2009, Nathaniel died at the age of 7 due to a subdural hematoma in the hospital. Aftermath Nathaniel's cause of death was determined to be complications of traumatic brain injury, with severe failure to thrive due to nutrient deprivation as a contributing factor. The autopsy also revealed that the boy had 80 total external injuries, 20 of which were injuries to his head. The prosecution argued that a pattern of neglect and abuse was evident due to Nathaniel's low weight, failure to consistently access therapeutic care, and the injuries evident from his autopsy. The Cravens' defense maintained that the boy was treated with care: Nathaniel was born premature at 3.5 pounds and never exceeded the 5th percentile of weight for boys of his age, that they had sought expert medical care, and that the boy had caused these injuries himself. However other family members reported that there was no evidence of this. Speaking to investigators, Michael Craver's mother reported an incident several months before Nathaniel's death in which she was astonished at the extent of Nathaniel's injuries. Nathaniel's adoptive grandmother described an egg-sized lump on his forehead and reported that his eyes were swollen shut. Ultimately, the Cravers were both convicted of involuntary manslaughter and released on time served after spending nearly 19 months (567 days) in jail awaiting trial. This case was also notable as, according to Russian officials, it is one of many instances of Russian children's abuse and neglect at the hands of American adoptive parents. Russian authorities alleged that, at the time of Nathaniel's death, no fewer than 17 Russian children had died under the care of American adoptive parents. Russian officials expressed displeasure with the Cravers' sentences and Nathaniel's death prompted treaty negotiations between the United States and Russia. This treaty required approval by Russian authorities for adoption agencies to operate (except in cases where the adopter and adoptee(s) are related), and the monitoring the chid's adoptive home by social workers. The treaty also allows the potential adopting parent to more information regarding the potential adopted child's medical and psychological history.

Located in the northern section of the park, Mount Degenhardt is southeast of Mount Terror, west of Inspiration Peak. and west of McMillan Spire. Mount Degenhardt is named after William Degenhardt, an early 20th century mountain climber. The Terror Glacier lies on the southeast slopes of Mount Degenhardt. Climate Mount Degenhardt is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Due to its temperate climate and proximity to the Pacific Ocean, areas west of the Cascade Crest very rarely experience temperatures below or above . During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Etymology Brazeau Township is named after Brazeau Creek, which in turn was named for Joseph Brazeau (also spelled Obrazo) a merchant from St. Louis, Missouri in the years 1791-1799, or a member of his family. History The earliest settlers to the area of present-day Brazeau Township were French traders and Shawnee Indians who had been granted the right to settle along Apple creek as a buffer against other tribes to the south. The Spanish authorities also granted Catholic American settlers who arrived from Maryland by way of Kentucky the right to settle in the area, establishing a community called the Fenwick Settlement. The township was organized in 1821, and Brazeau Township was one of the three original townships in Perry County, Missouri, with the other two townships being Bois Brule and Cinque Hommes. Soon thereafter, Protestant English and Scots-Irish settlers arrived from North Carolina. In 1839, German Lutheran immigrants from the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg arrived and established 6 \\"colonies\\" in the township: Altenburg, Dresden, Frohna, Johannisberg, Seelitz, and Wittenberg. The seventh colony, Paitzdorf (Uniontown, Missouri), lies in Union Township Geography Brazeau Township covers an area of 63.8 square miles (102.7km2) and contains the two incorporated villages of Altenburg and Frohna, as well as the unincorporated villages of Brazeau, Seventy-Six and Wittenberg.

Dobrev donated all the money he collected to charities, orphanages, churches, and monasteries. He turned 100 in July 2014. In Bulgarian, his name translates as \\"good\\" or \\"kind\\". Early life Dobrev was born 20 July 1914 in the village of Bailovo. His father, Dimitar, died in World War I and his mother, Katerina, had to raise their children by herself. Dobrev did not remember his youth and school years. Adult life Over the years, Dobrev became detached from the material aspects of life and devoted himself entirely to the spiritual world, specifically in the Orthodox faith. Around the year 2000, he decided to donate all his belongings to the Orthodox church when he began to live very modestly in a small extension to the Saints Cyril and Methodius parish church in his native village of Bailovo. About that time, he embarked on his mission to raise funds for the restoration of churches and monasteries across Bulgaria. ‚Äì —á–∞—Å—Ç –æ—Ç —Ñ–∏–ª–º–∞ ‚Äû–õ–µ–ø—Ç–∞\\" (2000 –≥.), –ø—Ä–æ–¥—É–∫—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞ —Ñ–æ–Ω–¥–∞—Ü–∏—è ‚Äû–ü–æ–∫—Ä–æ–≤ –ë–æ–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∏—á–µ–Ω\\" It is this new direction in life and the example he gave with his asceticism that led many to call him The Saint of Bailovo. Over the course of his lifetime, Dobrev donated over 80,000 Bulgarian lev (40,000 euros) to churches, monasteries and other noble deeds. Among his biggest donations are: * 10,000 Bulgarian lev (5,000 euros) to the Saints Cyril and Methodius parish church in his native Bailovo * 25,000 Bulgarian lev (12,500 euros) for restoration of the Eleshnishki Monastery Mother Mary located to the east of Sofia, and the local church in the village of Gorno Kamartsi. * 35,700 Bulgarian lev (17,850 euros) for the Cathedral of Alexander Nevsky in Sofia, which is the biggest donation in the known history of the over 100-year-old cathedral. Personal life and death Dobrev married around 1940, as Bulgaria joined World War II. In one of the bombings of Sofia, a bomb fell near him and he lost almost all his hearing. Dobrev and his wife had four children, two of whom he outlived. Dobrev was an Orthodox Christian and commonly talked about Jesus to others whether they donated or not. He was usually very thankful to those who donated. Dobrev died on 13 February 2018, at Kremikovtsi Monastery. He was 103.

Biography A young Nono entered the Accademia of Venice, then under the leadership of Pompeo Marino Molmenti. But by at the age of twenty years, he went to Polcenigo in the Friulian countryside, and he began to refine his style of landscape paintings, including Sull' Avemaria, Le sorgenti del Gorgazzo, Ritorno dai campi, and Verso sera. He later returned to painting genre subjects of everyday life, and these paintings would prove to be his most influential. If his contemporary, Giacomo Favretto depicted the sunny and humorous events of contemporary Venice, Nono delved into the painful and poignant scenes. For example, one of his paintings, Abbandonati exhibited at the 5th Exposizione of Venice, depicts a homeless mother and child sleeping under a church portal. He also paints the funeral of a child. La pittura veneziana, by Pompeo Gherado Molmenti, Fratelli Alinari, editors, Florence, 1903, pages 155-157. In 1880 at Turin, he exhibited: La caccia ai grilli and The Fruitseller; in 1881 at Milan, he displayed a genre painting, L'Ave Maria, and others titled: La povera madre; a half-figure Autunno; and October Morning. To the 1881 Mostra of Venice, he sent: Le amanti and Refugium peccatorum, considered one of his masterworks. To the 1883 Promotrice, he sent Sottomarino. To Rome also in 1883, he redisplayed Refugium peccatorum.Refugium is now in the Galleria Nazionale d‚ÄôArte Moderna in Rome. Also in 1883, he exhibited La Morte del Pulcino in Milan.

It was given the reference number SAM-A-1, the first Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) in the 1947 tri-service designation system. By 1950 over 100 test rockets had been launched using a variety of configurations and power plants, with one launch in 1949 setting the altitude record for a ramjet powered vehicle at . GAPA faced strong competition from the US Army's Nike missile system, and was eventually cancelled in favour of Nike for deployment. The GAPA work was later re-used by the Boeing and Project Wizard team at the Michigan Aeronautical Research Center to develop a much longer-ranged missile, the CIM-10 Bomarc. Bomarc would end up competing with the Army's Hercules missile, and was deployed only in small numbers. History =German work= The inherent inaccuracy of anti-aircraft artillery means that when shells reach their targets they are randomly distributed in space. This distribution is much larger than the lethal radius of the shells, so the chance that any one shell will successfully hit the target is very small. Successful anti-aircraft gunnery therefore requires as many rounds to be fired as possible, increasing the chances that one of the rounds will get a \\"hit\\". German gunners estimated that an average of 2,800 shells were required to down a single Boeing B-17. Flying faster means that the aircraft passes through the range of a gun more rapidly, reducing the number of rounds a particular gun can fire at that aircraft. Flying at higher altitudes has a similar effect, as it requires larger shells to reach those altitudes, and this typically results in slower firing rates for a variety of practical reasons. Aircraft using jet engines basically double the speed and altitude of conventional designs, so limiting the number of shells that the chance of hitting the bomber essentially dropped to zero. As early as 1942, German flak commanders were keenly aware of the problem, and expecting to face jet bombers, they began a missile development program to supplant their guns. Of the many programs that resulted, the designs fell into two categories. One used a high-speed missile that flew directly up at the target. With enough speed the missile did not have to \\"lead\\" the target by a great amount, as the bomber moved only a short distance in the time between launch and interception. A second class used aircraft-like designs that were first boosted to altitude in front of the bombers, then flew at them on intercept courses at much lower speeds. These were essentially radio-guided drone versions of the Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket-propelled interceptor aircraft carrying very large warheads. =US Army program= The western allies maintained air superiority for much of the war and development of new anti-aircraft systems was not as urgent. Nevertheless, by the mid-war period the US Army had reached the same conclusion as their German counterparts; flak was simply no longer useful. Accordingly, in February 1944 the Army Ground Forces sent the Army Service Forces (ASF) a request for information on the possibility of building a \\"major caliber anti-aircraft rocket torpedo\\". The ASF concluded that it was simply too early to tell if this was possible, and suggested concentrating on a program of general rocket development instead. The introduction of German jet-powered bombers late in 1944 led to a re- evaluation of this policy, and on 26 January 1945 the Army Chief of Ordnance issued a requirement for a new guided missile weapon system. Like the German efforts, the Army designs quickly fell into two groups, high-speed line-of- sight weapons for short ranges, and airplane-like systems that flew at lower speeds but offered longer range. Eventually two such programs were selected; Bell Labs, a world leader in radar, radio control and automated aiming systems (see Hendrik Wade Bode) won the contract for a short-range weapon known as Project Nike. Boeing led development of an aircraft-like longer range system, GAPA, designated project MX-606. =GAPA= Although GAPA was based on similar principles as earlier German designs, it evolved into an entirely different concept; GAPA designs were long and thin and looked like missiles, not aircraft. Aerojet was selected to build solid-fuel boosters, while Boeing tried a wide variety of engine designs for the upper stage. The first test shot of an unguided GAPA airframe design took place on 13 June 1946 from a launch pad at the World War II Wendover Bombing and Gunnery Range on the western edge of the Bonneville Salt Flats. These early \\"Model 600\\" designs were for aerodynamic testing only, and used solid fuel in both stages. Over the following two week period, a total of 38 launches were conducted, ending on 1 July. In a report to the President's Air Policy Commission in October, Boeing reported the range of the system at . The need for a 50-mile range, Mach 0.9 version was identified for the \\"interim\\" air defense system. In early 1948 the USAF was \\"ready to buy complete GAPA missiles for test and training purposes, [but] guidance components were not available\\", and of the planned $5.5 million for GAPA, only $3 million was provided in July 1948. At the end of 1948, Air Material Command was instructed to buy 70 test vehicles. Over 74 launches took place at the Alamogordo Guided Missile Test Base beginning on 23 July 1947 (the 39th launch). A ramjet powered Model 602 first flew on 14 November 1947, and a liquid-fuel rocket Model 601 on 12 March 1948. By the end of the test program in 1950, 114 launches were carried out, with the last on 15 August 1950. By 1949 the performance of the competing Nike design had demonstrated capabilities similar to GAPA, at about , and was much closer to being ready for deployment. The Department of Defense (DoD) saw no need for two systems with similar performance, and inter-service fighting since the 1948 creation of the Air Force was a constant problem for the DoD. They eventually decided the matter in 1949 when the Joint Chiefs of Staff determined that each branch of the armed forces would conduct missile development according to its mission and handed the Army control of all short- range air defences, whether missile or gun. GAPA was cancelled outright, and a new contract for a much longer-range weapon was created under MX-1599. To keep GAPA development alive in the meantime, the US Air Force re-directed funding from an anti-ballistic missile program, Project Thumper, which was being ended in favour of a more advanced system, Project Wizard. =Computer work= Boeing built two computers to aid with development of the GAPA effort. The first was the BEMAC, Boeing Electro-Mechanical Analog Computer, which was used for various calculations and aerodynamic research. The second, BEAC, the Boeing Electronic Analog Computer, was developed in 1949 in Seattle to aid calculations in the GAPA project. BEAC proved so useful that other divisions within the company started asking for time on the system. This led the Physical Research Unit to build further examples of improved models of BEAC for the Acoustics and Electrical Department, Aerodynamics, Power Plant, Mechanical Equipment and Structures Department. Given the success of the BEAC design, the company began to offer it commercially in 1950. Sales continued through the 1950s. =Bomarc= The new MX-1599 also ran into development and funding problems, and repeated early history when the project was joined by the team from the Michigan Aeronautical Research Center (MARC) working on Project Wizard. Wizard was based on a high performance missile, existing only on paper, able to intercept missiles travelling at up to at altitudes up to . Wizard had also put considerable thought into the problem of early detection and communications needed for interceptions that lasted only minutes. The combination of the two teams, from Boeing and MARC, resulted in the new BOMARC name. At the time the Air Force considered missiles to be unmanned aircraft, and assigned the new missile the \\"F-99\\" name, considering its role to be the same as a fighter aircraft. This was later changed to \\"Interceptor Missile\\", IM-99. and finally CIM-10 Bomarc when the 1962 United States Tri-Service missile and drone designation system was introduced.Parsch 2002 Bomarc development dragged on, and by 1956 less than 25 test launches had taken place, many of them failures. By this point the Army had begun early production of its greatly improved Nike Hercules missile, which offered high supersonic speeds, intercept altitudes as high as , and ranges on the order of . Although Bomarc's range was much greater than Hercules, the mission of protecting cities was adequately served, and Hercules was dramatically simpler, cheaper and more reliable (Bomarc was estimated to be ready to fire 25% of the time or less). Description There were three main models of the GAPA vehicle, and their layout differed considerably. All were \\"missile like\\" with four cropped-delta fins at the extreme rear of a cylindrical fuselage capped with an ogive nose cone. Aerodynamic lift for control was provided by a long wing running along the upper surface of the fuselage, only slightly wider that the body. The wing tapered to a point just behind the nose cone. The booster was about the same length as the missile, although slightly larger in diameter and featuring much larger cropped-delta fins. GAPA used beam riding guidance, in which the missile attempts to keep itself centred in the middle of a radar signal that is pointed directly at the target. This system allows a single powerful radar to act as both the tracking and guidance system. However, beam riding also means that the missile has to fly directly at its target, and therefore cannot \\"lead\\" it to a calculated intercept point. This means of guidance is generally inefficient as it requires the missile to continue maneuvering throughout the approach as the radar is moved to continue tracking the target. This can be significant in the case of high-speed aircraft.

Even immigration from holy Mecca city to the newborn city Medina, (because of disturbance of non-believers) had rewards for only those people who did it for God's sake and his prophet when Muhammad was alive.

Etymology Union Township is named after Uniontown, Missouri. The town‚Äôs original name, Paitzdorf, was changed during the American Civil War in response to Union soldiers encamped nearby. History The area of Union Township was originally under the authority of the New Bourbon District, which was one of two districts formed by the French colonial administration of Upper Louisiana (New France). Authority passed from French to Spanish colonial administration when the colony was handed over to Spain in 1762. The French colonials in Ste. Genevieve were continuously harassed by Osage Indians to the south. Looking to stop the harassment and raids, the Spanish authorities in the 1790s invited Shawnee and Delaware Indians from Indiana and Ohio to immigrate and settle in the area around Apple Creek to act as a buffer against Osage raids. The Shawnee and Delaware established a number of villages around Apple Creek, with Le Grand Village Sauvage or \\"Big Village\\" as it was known to the Americans, being one of the largest. American harassment and encroachment on Shawnee and Delaware lands caused tensions and the eventual removal of the Shawnee and Delaware from the region. Some of the earliest Europeans to put down roots in the area were English and Scotch-Irish Methodist settlers from North Carolina who settled in the Longtown area in 1821. Among the earliest families were the Abernathys, Farrars, and Rutledgers.'Gone But Not Forgotten'-Missouri Pioneers These settlers were part of a large exodus from the Piedmont region of North Carolina following the War of 1812. The settlement was initially known as the \\"Abernathy Settlement\\". It is not clear why the name changed to Longtown. Later, in 1840 the village of Paitzdorf (Uniontown) was founded by members of the German Saxon Lutheran immigration. The King‚Äôs Road (French: Le Chemin du Roi, Spanish: El Camino Real), runs through the township linking Perryville, Missouri to Jackson, Missouri. Union Township was organized between 1870-1890.

Phillips Oppenheim's short story \\"The False Gods\\". Over six acts, the Malay-language play follows two brothers, one a devout son who holds firmly to his morals and personal honour, while the other worships money and prioritises personal gain. Over more than a decade, the two learn that money (the titular false god) is not the path to happiness. Kwee Tek Hoay's first stage play, Allah jang Palsoe was written as a realist response to whimsical contemporary theatres. Though the published stageplay sold poorly and the play was deemed difficult to perform, Allah jang Palsoe found success on the stage. By 1930 it had been performed by various ethnic Chinese troupes to popular acclaim and pioneered a body of work by authors such as Lauw Giok Lan, Tio Ie Soei, and Tjoa Tjien Mo. In 2006 the script for the play, which continues to be performed, was republished with updated spelling by the Lontar Foundation. Plot Brothers Tan Kioe Lie and Tan Kioe Gie are preparing to leave their Cicuruk home to find work: Kioe Lie will go to Bandung, while Kioe Gie will go to Batavia (now Jakarta) and become a letter-setter. As they are packing, Kioe Lie's fianc√©e Gouw Hap Nio visits. She leaves some snacks with their father, the poor farmer Tan Lauw Pe, before going home, promising to take care of Pe while his sons are away. The brothers finish packing, say goodbye to their father, and head for the train station. Three years later, Kioe Lie visits his brother in the latter's Batavia home. Kioe Gie has become an editor of the newspaper Kamadjoean and is known as a generous philanthropist. Kioe Lie, meanwhile, has become the manager of a tapioca factory, but is planning to leave for competing business run by Tjio Tam Bing, who has offered him twice the salary. Kioe Gie asks him to reconsider, or at least not take any customers, but Kioe Lie is set on his goals. Before Kioe Lie leaves, the brothers discuss marriage: since Kioe Lie has no intent to marry Hap Nio soon, Kioe Gie asks permission to marry first. Though Kioe Lie disapproves of Kioe Gie's sweetheart, a poor orphan girl named Oeij Ijan Nio, he agrees. Another four years pass, and Kioe Gie has become editor-in-chief of Kemadjoean and married Ijan Nio. He is concerned, however, over the newspaper's new political orientation: the owner, Oeij Tjoan Siat, is aiming to make the paper pro-Dutch East Indies, a stance that Kioe Gie considers a betrayal to the ethnic Chinese. When Tjoan Siat comes to Kioe Gie's home to ask him to follow the former's new political leanings, heavily influenced by a monthly payment of 2,000 gulden offered by an unnamed political party, Kioe Gie refuses and resigns. During the following week Kioe Gie and his wife sell their belongings and prepare to move back to Cicuruk. This departure is delayed by a visit from Kioe Lie, who reveals that he will be marrying Tam Bing's widow Tan Houw Nio ‚Äì Tam Bing having died the year before. Kioe Gie is horrified, both because the widow has the same surname and because Kioe Lie had promised their father on his deathbed to marry Hap Nio. After an extensive argument, Kioe Lie disowns his brother and leaves. Five years later, Kioe Lie and Houw Nio's marriage is failing. Owing to poor investments (some made with embezzled money), Houw Nio's gambling, and Kioe Lie's keeping of a mistress, they have lost their fortune. Kioe Lie tries to convince his wife to sell her jewellery, thus allowing him to return the stolen money. Houw Nio, however, refuses, tells him to sell the house and his mistress' jewellery, and then leaves. Soon afterwards, Kioe Lie's friend Tan Tiang An warns him that he will be arrested by the police unless he flees the colony. Together they rent a car and Kioe Lie heads for the port at Batavia. Passing through Cicuruk, the car breaks down and, while the chauffeur attempts to fix it, Kioe Lie takes shelter in a nearby home. He learns that it belongs to Kioe Gie and Hap Nio, who have built up a vast farm, garden, and orchard that provide them with ample income. The two philanthropists are friends with the area's elite, and Hap Nio is happily married to a rich plantation administrator. When Kioe Gie and his companions return from playing tennis, they discover Kioe Lie hiding shamefully under a piano. Kioe Lie admits that he was wrong to be greedy. When a police officer arrives, Kioe Lie confesses to poisoning Tam Bing, then runs outside and shoots himself.

Born to an ethnic Chinese textile merchant and his wife, Kwee was raised in Chinese culture and schools that focused on modernity. By the time he wrote the drama, Kwee Tek Hoay was an active proponent of Buddhist theology. However, he also wrote extensively on themes relating to the native population of the archipelago and was a keen social observer. He read extensively in Dutch, English, and Malay, and drew on these readings after becoming a writer. According to the historian Nio Joe Lan, Allah jang Palsoe was the first stage drama in Malay by a Chinese writer. The six-act work was written in vernacular Malay, the lingua franca of the Indies, and was based on E. Phillips Oppenheim's short story \\"The False Gods\\". Though in his foreword Kwee Tek Hoay apologised for the quality of the stage play, writing that \\"the content and arrangement of this book are far from what you could call neat\\", Sumardjo praises his language, feeling that the story flowed well. At the time Allah jang Palsoe was written, stage performances were heavily influenced by orality. Contemporary theatres, such as bangsawan and stamboel, were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines. Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy, considering it \\"better to say things as they are, than to create events out of nothing, which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers, are falsehoods and lies, going against the truth\\". After condemning contemporary playwrights who merely wrote down existing stories, Kwee Tek Hoay expressed the hope that ultimately a unique form of Chinese Malay theatre‚Äîinspired by European theatrical traditions but dealing with Chinese themes‚Äîcould be developed.; . Allah jang Palsoe was intended to be the first published stage play in this new tradition. Kwee Tek Hoay made numerous recommendations for the play's casting, costuming, setting, and music. He wrote that if sufficiently talented actors to portray Kioe Lie and Kioe Gie could not be found, \\"it would be better to not perform this show\\", and that Ijan Nio needed to show \\"a perfect woman or wife\\", as opposed to the \\"fierce and rough\\" Houw Nio. He provided four set designs, to be used at appropriate points in the plot, and gave suggestions for setting up the needed backgrounds and props. Kwee recommended that the play include only one song, John Payne and Henry Bishop's \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\", which was to be performed in the sixth act with either English or Malay vocals and a trio of piano, viola, and guitar or mandolin. Analysis The style of Allah jang Palsoe was inspired by the realism of Henrik Ibsen. The title Allah jang Palsoe is a reference to money, with an underlying didactic message that money is not everything in the world, and that an unquenchable thirst for it would turn one into \\"a money animal\\". Throughout the dialogue, money is referred to as the false God, with Lie as a character who deifies money to the point of ignoring his other duties and only realising his error after it is too late. Gie, although he does become rich, does not consider money a god, but is a philanthropist and holds to his morals. The Indonesian literary critic Sapardi Djoko Damono writes that such a message would have been popular among ethnic Chinese of the contemporary Indies, and as such the play would have been a favourite of social organisations. The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo likewise notes money as the central issue of Allah jang Palsoe, writing that the play shows individuals doing anything to earn it‚Äîeven sacrificing their values. He writes that the corrupting nature of money remains present in the best of times, and considers Kwee Tek Hoay's message to have been too heavily based in morality rather than considerations of social and human factors. As a result, he writes, readers are brought to understand the lust for money as a \\"human illness\\" which must be overcome: they should follow the example of Tan Kioe Gie, not Tan Kioe Lie. John Kwee of the University of Auckland, citing Gie's departure from Kamadjoean, suggests that this was a challenge directed at the Chinese Malay press, then becoming increasingly commercial. Allah jang Palsoe also contains themes unrelated to money. The sinologist Thomas Rieger notes the presence of a Chinese national identity, pointing to Gie as a young man \\"excelling in all Confucianist values\\", leaving his comfortable job rather than becoming an apologist for the Dutch colonial government to the detriment of his ethnic Chinese peers. Another sinologist, Myra Sidharta, looks at Kwee Tek Hoay's view of women. She writes that his depiction of an ideal woman was not yet fully developed in Allah jang Palsoe, though she finds Houw Nio to be a depiction of how a woman should not act: selfish and addicted to gambling. In a preface to his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay wrote that he had drawn inspiration from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in Allah jang Palsoe. He compares the stage directions in Allah jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them to be similar in their level of detail. Release and reception Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang The script for Allah jang Palsoe was released by the Batavia-based publisher Tjiong Koen Bie in mid-1919.; . This edition included a foreword from the author, four illustrations of recommended stage decor, a number of performance guidelines, and a brief outline of the state of the theatre among the ethnic Chinese. Kwee Tek Hoay paid for this printing, a run of 1,000 copies, out of his own pocket and saw large financial losses. The stage play was republished in 2006, using the Perfected Spelling System, as part of the first volume of the Lontar Foundation's anthology of Indonesian stage dramas. Allah jang Palsoe was well received and broadly adopted. Troupes were allowed to perform the play as a charity opera, though proceeds were to go to the branch in Bogor. One performance is recorded as garnering 10,000 gulden. According to an advertisement, by 1930 the play had been performed \\"tens of times\\" and was popular with ethnic Chinese theatre troupes. Kwee Tek Hoay received numerous letters from fans of Allah jang Palsoe, spurring him to continue writing. Considering the play too difficult for native troupes to stage, when one such troupe, the Union Dalia Opera, requested permission to perform it, Kwee Tek Hoay instead wrote a new story for them. This later became his best-selling novel Boenga Roos dari Tjikembang (The Rose of Cikembang). Another of Kwee Tek Hoay's stage dramas, Korbannja Kong-Ek, was inspired by a friend, who wrote him a letter asking for another comforting and educational play after reading Allah jang Palsoe. In 1926 Kwee Tek Hoay wrote that, after Allah jang Palsoe, the quality of stage performances in the Indies had increased noticeably. Nio notes that the quantity of stage plays by ethnic Chinese authors likewise increased. Though not many were ultimately published, the body of work pioneered by Allah jang Palsoe included plays by Kwee Tek Hoay (Korbannja Kong-Ek, Mait Hidoep, Plesiran Hari Minggoe), Lauw Giok Lan (Pendidikan jang Kliroe), Tio Ie Soei (Jan Tio), and Tjoa Tjien Mo (Beng Lee Koen, Hsi Shih). Sumardjo writes that, though Allah jang Palsoe was published seven years before the Rustam Effendi's Bebasari (generally considered the first canonic Indonesian stage drama), Kwee Tek Hoay's writing shows all the hallmarks of a literary work. Though the drama is not considered part of the Indonesian literary canon, performances have continued into the 21st century. In May 2003, the Jakarta-based put on an abridged performance directed by E. Sumadiningrat. Another Jakarta-based troupe, Teater Bejana, has included it in their repertoire.

The team were active in international events between 1997 and 2006, having started off in national events in 1991. Racing history =Early history= In 1991, Centenari built the M1, and entered Federico D'Amore in several Italian Prototype Championship events that year. The best result of the season was a third-placed finish at Enna-Pergusa. For 1992, D'Amore left the team, and Stefano Speranza was entered at Monza, but failed to finish. Arturo Merzario was then entered in two races, with his best finish being eighth at Vallelunga. The car was not used again in 1993, but Merzario used the car from 1994 until 1997 in the series. He took the car's first ever victory at Vallelunga in 1995, and he would take four more Italian Prototype Championship victories in the car. =International Sports Racing Series= Arturo Merzario, driving the Centenari M1-Alfa Romeo at Donington Park, 5 July 1997 In 1997, Centenari entered the new International Sports Racing Series (ISRS), using their own Centenari M1 chassis. This featured an Alfa Romeo- sourced 3-litre V6 engine, and was classified as a SR2 car. The team made its debut in the season opener at Donington Park, with Merzario and Giovanni Li Calzi hired as drivers, and won their class at the first attempt; as the only other SR2 class entry, a Didier Bonnet Racing-entered Debora LMP297-BMW, retired from the event. Although they retired from the following round at Zolder, having entered under the \\"Symbol Team\\" banner, they took an overall win at Brno (competing in the CN class as no other SR1 or SR2 entries were present) for the only time in the team's history. The entry for the final race at Jarama was made under the Centenari name once more, and the team took the SR2 class victory, and finished second overall. For 1998, a new car, the Centenari Mac3, was developed, and the team expanded to a two-car effort, with the M1 being retained. The team started their season at the 1000 km Monza, which was part of the GT Italian Challenge and the Challenge Endurance Italia, with Loic Depailler, Xavier Pompidou, Giovanna Amati and Marco Lucchinelli driving the new Mac3, and Merzario, Giovanni Li Calzi, Robin Donovan and Fulvio Ballabio driving the older M1. Although the two cars were qualified in seventh and twelfth respectively, neither car had a successful race; the Mac3 didn't make the start, and the M1 retired after 73 laps. Both cars finished the ISRS season opener at Paul Ricard, with the M1 finishing fourth, and the Mac3 finishing sixth; both cars were classified in the CN category, and they were the only cars in that category to finish the race. This was followed by a ninth and tenth overall finish (second and third in the CN class) for the Mac3 and M1 at Brno. For Misano, Centenari entered three cars; two M1s, and a Mac3. Both M1s retired, but the Mac3 finished twelfth, and fifth in class. At Donington Park, only one of the M1s was classified as finishing, in last place overall; the other M1 did not start the race, and the Mac3 completed too few laps to be classified. Anderstorp once more saw only one M1 finish, in last place overall; the Mac3's gearbox failed after 31 laps, and the other M1's differential failed after a single lap. N√ºrburgring saw a small improvement; the Mac3 and one M1 both finished, in twelfth and thirteenth overall; however, these were the bottom positions in the CN class. At the penultimate round at Le Mans, the Mac3 finished tenth overall and second in class, whilst one of the M1's engines expired before it completed a lap, and the other experienced an engine failure after 30 laps. A single M1 was the only entry in the season finale at Kyalami; however, it retired with clutch issues after 32 laps. Centenari were classified joint-second in the CN Team's Championship, and eleventh overall, at the end of the season. =Later history= Although the team did not lodge any international entries in 1999, the team returned to competitive racing in 2000, entering Jo√£o Barbosa, Georg Paulin and Andrea Piccini in the Mac3 at the 6 Hours of Vallelunga, but retired after 53 laps. In 2002, the Mac3 was entered in two rounds of the Interserie by Jo Zeller Racing. Classified as a Division 5 car and driven by Josef Pfyl, it won its class (finishing fourth overall) in the first race it was entered in, the first race of the Most weekend, and second in class, seventh overall, in the second race at Most. Jo Zeller Racing entered the car again at the Hockenheimring round of the Interserie, with Pfyl finishing tenth overall (fourth in Group L) in race one, and eighth in race two, third in Group L. The Mac3 was then left unused for three years, before Motori di Carlotta entered it at the 6 Hours of Vallelunga in 2005; the car, driven by Filippo Vita, Diego Borgese and Luigi De Luca, qualified in second place overall, but retired from the race just after the two-hour mark, having completed 75 laps. After an absence from racing of six years, Centenari Racing entered the 6 Hours of Vallelunga in 2006, with a new Centenari MG3 car. The new car featured an Alfa Romeo engine, just like the M1 and Mac3, with Giovanni Mezzasalma and Giovanni Cassibba being employed to drive it. Centenari finished thirteenth overall, and second in the CN4 class, having completed 182 laps in the race. However, neither the MG3, nor the older Mac3 or M1 cars, have been used since in international events.

All 52 passengers and crew aboard the aircraft perished in the crash.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was an Antonov An-24RV, registered CCCP-46534 to Aeroflot. The aircraft rolled off the final assembly line February 27, 1975. In the aircraft's service life it accumulated 2,996 flight hours and 2,228 pressurization cycles.  Crew  Six crew members were aboard the flight. The cockpit crew consisted of: * Captain Fyodor Chumak * Copilot Viktor Pashchenko * Navigator Pyotr Maksimenko * Navigator in training Viktor Kozlov * Flight Engineer Ivan Ukhan  Synopsis  Thunderclouds were present above the Chernihiv region sky for the duration of the flight. Moderate wind blowing southwest on a bearing of 250¬∞ at 6 m/s was present, along with moderate rain showers. Visibility on the ground at the airport was 10 kilometers with a cumulonimbus cloudcover. Flight 1802 was flying at an altitude of 5700 meters with a speed of 350 km/h when at approximately 10:47 the rudder suddenly deviated 25¬∞ to the right, changing the roll angle and yaw. The pilots responded quickly to this deflection by adjusting the ailerons in their attempts to reduce the roll. A few seconds later the rudder deflected 9¬∞, and the elevators deviated resulting in 30¬∞ to pitch (nose held up). The airliner reached sharp angles of attack, and thus went into a tailspin. At the time of entry into the spin, the propellers were feathered. The airliner crashed 14.5 kilometers southeast of Chernigovskiy airport on a bearing of 245¬∞ at 10:48 with a rate of descent at nearly 100 m/s in uncontrolled flight. All 52 people on board the aircraft perished in the crash.  Causes  The aircraft crashed due to loss of control caused by the rudder deflecting when the autopilot was disconnected, but the root cause of the rudder deflection was never determined. It is possible one of the pilots accidentally pushed the rudder trim control switch. Electrical failure could also have caused the mechanical issues.

An investigation revealed the aircraft entered a steep dive after the flaps were accidentally extended. Accident Flight 245 was a scheduled passenger flight from Vnukovo to Sochi. At 14:34 Moscow time the Ilyushin departed Vnukovo International Airport and climbed to its cruising altitude of 8,000 meters. At 15:47 the crew contacted ATC and gave a position report, then the flight again communicated with ATC at 15:52. At 15:59 the controller was unable to raise flight 245 and it disappeared from radar. While in level flight cruising at 630 km/h the flight engineer inadvertently moved the flaps selector to full extension of 40 degrees and due to the large amount of drag and the Ilyushin Il-18's peculiar aerodynamic design the aircraft pitched over and entered a steep descent. Without retracting the flaps it would be almost impossible to regain control of the aircraft and due to the high negative g-force the crew were experiencing they could not reach the flap selector. As the airliner gained speed in its dive the port and starboard flap assemblies were ripped from the wing by high aerodynamic forces. At 16:00 the aircraft impacted the ground at very high speed with the landing gear retracted and at a pitch angle of 107 degrees. The impact crater measured from 3.5 to 5 meters deep and the debris field was 300 to 350 meters in width. Aircraft The aircraft involved was an Ilyushin Il-18B, serial number 188000503 and registered as CCCP-75654 to Aeroflot. The construction of the airliner was completed on 30 October 1958 and it had sustained a total of 2,722 flight hours before the crash. Investigation Investigators determined that the cause of the accident was the deployment of full flaps at cruising speed. Unlike the Ilyushin Il-14 aircraft, the IL 18 did not have a mechanism to prevent accidental flap selector movement and this was found to be a contributing factor in the accident sequence.

The topographical images of Kip and Knyff are significant for providing reliable illustrations of the development of the formal English garden in the Dutch-French style.

The raids were described by Human Rights Watch as the most serious incident of mass unlawful killings in modern Egyptian history. On 10 December, thirteen Egyptian and international human rights organizations urged Cairo's interim authorities to probe the mass killing of protesters in the capital on August 14. The joint call issued by organizations that included Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, said an investigation must be launched into the killing of \\"up to 1,000 people by security forces\\" almost four months ago when they dispersed sit-ins by supporters of deposed president Mohamed Morsi. \\"There can be no hope for the rule of law and political stability in Egypt, much less some modicum of justice for victims, without accountability for what may be the single biggest incident of mass killing in Egypt's recent history,\\" said Gasser Abdel-Razak, associate director at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. \\"As a first step toward accountability, the government should establish an effective independent fact-finding committee to investigate responsibility throughout the chain of command for the unlawful killings,\\" the rights groups said. They said that on August 14 a \\"small minority of protesters used firearms... but the police responded excessively by shooting recklessly, going far beyond what is permitted under international law.\\" \\"After the unprecedented levels of violence and casualties seen since the ousting of Mohamed Morsi, investigations must provide real answers and cannot be another whitewash of the security forces' record,\\" Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui of Amnesty International said in the statement. \\"Egypt's authorities cannot deal with the carnage through PR in world's capitals, rewriting events and locking up Morsi's supporters.\\" The groups also said the probe should determine whether there is any evidence of a policy to kill protesters or commit other serious crimes.

In 1931, Engler withdrew from the movement and focused on her career as a writer. After the war she lived in Berlin and unsuccessfully attempted to continue her literary work. She did not return to activism, and died in obscurity in Berlin in 1972.  Biography  = Early years 1899‚Äì1925 = Engler was born on 27 September 1899 in Schwiebus as daughter of Maria Franziska Engler and her husband Gustav Engler, a maker of slippers. Engler had eleven siblings, the family lived in poor conditions. The father died in 1912, in the following year Selma left school at the age of fourteen. In 1914 the mother moved to Berlin with some of the children. As the eldest of the siblings, Engler worked to support the family, initially as a saleswoman, later as an office clerk and accountant. From 1921 on, making a living was taken over by her siblings, who had grown up in the meantime; Engler presumably ran the family household at Nostitzstra√üe 61 for the next few years. This provided her with economic and temporal leeway for the coming decade, which she also used for her education; she learned English and the violin, and at the same time she found the time to pursue her \\"literary inclinations for a few hours a day\\". = Activist life 1926‚Äì1931 = At this time at the latest, she also became part of the lesbian scene in Berlin and dealt with sexual science writings on female homosexuality. However, the exact time of her coming out is not known. Engler was described as a so-called \\"virile\\" homosexual woman and identified herself as a masculine lesbian woman, similar to the later emerging concept of a butch. Franz Scott, a contemporary author on the lesbian scene of the Weimar Republic, wrote about her nature that she \\"always had a distinguished masculine and serious swing\\", in 1929 she described herself with self-irony as \\"a pretty solid guy (who's laughing?)\\".Selli Engler: \\"Vom Stiftungsfest\\" In: Frauenliebe, Vol. 4, No. 36, p. 3 BIF 3/1927 (click to browse) Engler's work as an activist began either in 1925 or 1926 (probably the latter) with the founding and editorship of the magazine Die BIF ‚Äì Bl√§tter Idealer Frauenfreundschaften (\\"Papers of ideal women's friendship\\").Die BIF ceased publication after three monthly issues in 1927. Die BIF was unique among lesbian publications of the time as it was the first one published, edited and written solely by women; both competing magazines were dominated by men. From 1927 to 1929, Engler contributed to the magazine Frauenliebe and from 1929 to 1931 to Die Freundin. Beside many texts related to her activist work her writings included, in particular, short fiction, poems and serial novels. As an activist, Engler sought to improve the organization of lesbian women, following the lead of gay activists such as Friedrich Radszuweit and Carl Bergmann. She particularly asked lesbians to join Radszuweit's Bund f√ºr Menschenrecht. In addition to her work as a writer, she organized ladies' clubs to allow lesbian women to gather without distraction. From 1926 to 1927, she ran the weekly \\"Damen-BIF-Klub\\", and in September 1929, she opened the ladies' club Er√¢to on the premises of the Zauberfl√∂te, a well-known gay and lesbian venue. It appears to have been popular, as some of the club's events took place in venues with a capacity of some 600 persons. The club shut down after a few months and reopened in January 1931 on a smaller scale. It was last recorded as active in May 1931. After May 1931, Engler is no longer recorded as being active in the lesbian movement. Her name or that of the club Er√¢to does not appear again in scene publications. = Life in the Third Reich = In 1933, Engler sent a play titled Heil Hitler directly to Adolf Hitler. As Engler never before or after showed any nationalist or antisemitic attitudes and never got involved with the NSDAP or any other national socialist organisations, this step is currently understood as either being an opportunistic step towards a writer's career or an attempt to show herself as a loyal citizen in view of her own past. The Reich Dramaturgist, Rainer Schl√∂sser, approved of the play's ideology, but believed that it lacked artistic and dramatic merit. In 1933, 1938 and 1943, Engler filed an application for membership in the Reichsschrifttumskammer (RSK), part of the Reichskulturkammer, the state organization to which all artists were required to belong. Due to a lack of publications, her application was rejected. On the basis of the RSK-files, poems, prose texts, dramas and an opera libretto can be traced, she also gave occasional lectures, but none of her works has survived. = After the war = After the war Engler continued to live in Berlin-Kreuzberg in the Ritterstrasse as a writer, however, there are no known publications. In 1956 she was briefly observed by the East German Stasi, whose report described her as \\"1.69m tall, of stable figure, has a full face and was carelessly dressed.\\" At that time she made a living by subletting. She moved at the beginning of the 1970s to Berlin-Marienfelde, where she died shortly thereafter in April 1972. Legacy Already contemporary, Franz Scott saw Engler in an outstanding position as one of the pioneers of the lesbian movement alongside Lotte Hahm. According to him she \\"had achieved a certain significance among homosexual women\\". Alfred D√∂blin mounted a text passage of her novel Erkenntnis in a parodistic manner into a passage of his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz, where he deals with homosexual love. D√∂blin expert Gabriele Sander attests Engler a \\"highly trivial [...] Courths-Mahler style\\" in this context.Gabriele Sander: Alfred D√∂blins Berlin Alexanderplatz ‚Äì ein Text aus Texten. Literarische Paraphrasen und Parodien in intertextueller Betrachtung. In: Marily Mart√≠nez de Richter (ed.): Moderne in den Metropolen. Roberto Arlt und Alfred D√∂blin. Internationales Symposium, Buenos Aires ‚Äì Berlin 2004. K√∂nigshausen & Neumann, W√ºrzburg 2005, , p. 129. In an analysis of Englers novel Arme kleine Jett, Doris Claus emphasises the emancipatory value of Englers literary work. By drawing a lesbian way of life without massive conflicts with social environment and society in the realistically drawn Berlin female artist milieu, she sketches a utopia and offers possibilities for identification. Today, Engler is recognized above all for her activist activity as one of the \\"central and long-standing makers of the lesbian subculture in Berlin in the 1920s\\"Pers√∂nlichkeiten in Berlin 1825‚Äì2006 ‚Äì Erinnerungen an Lesben, Schwule, Bisexuelle, trans- und intergeschlechtliche Menschen.

Its common name is tropical soda apple leaf beetle. It is native to South America, where its distribution includes Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.Diaz, R., et al. Tropical soda apple leaf beetle, Gratiana boliviana. Entomology and Nematology. University of Florida, IFAS. 2012. It specializes on tropical soda apple (Solanum viarum), an invasive plant species. It has been released as an agent of biological pest control against the weedy plant in Florida and other parts of the United States. Description and life cycle The adult beetle is about long and wide. The young adult is green in color and turns yellow as it ages.Medal, J. C., et al. Biology of Gratiana boliviana, the first biocontrol agent released to control tropical soda apple in the USA. Document ENY-826 (IN487). Entomology and Nematology Department, Florida Cooperative Extension Service, University of Florida IFAS. Publication date 2003, revised 2011. It is pale brown during its overwintering stage, when it enters diapause. The ventral abdomen is somewhat transparent, and during its reproductive season the internal sex organs become visible: white oviducts in the female and orange testes in the male. The larva is light green and covered in spines. Older larvae usually carry fecal shields. The pupa is flattened and pale green in color. It rests attached to the underside of a leaf. In Florida, diapause occurs in December through March, during which time the adult is dormant and hidden in leaf litter. Starting in March or April, the adults come out to feed and mate. Seven to eight generations occur during the year. The female lays single eggs on the leaves of the tropical soda apple plant. A female can produce about 300 eggs. Each egg is between long including its wide, transparent, papery casing. The larva emerges in 5 to 6 days, feeds voraciously, progresses through five instars, and becomes a pupa after 16 to 18 days. Pupation lasts about a week. The female beetle lives 3 to 4 months. tropical soda apple Host interaction The main host plant of the beetle is the tropical soda apple (Solanum viarum), a prickly shrub in the nightshade family. Like the beetle, it is native to South America. It was first discovered in the United States in 1988 in Florida. It has since spread as far north as PennsylvaniaMedal, J. C., et al. (2002).

Biocontrol Science and Technology 18(2) 193-207. As of 2011, over one million acres are infested in the United States. The tropical soda apple has been nicknamed \\"the plant from hell\\".Coile, N. C. Tropical Soda Apple, Solanum viarum Dunal: The Plant from Hell. Botany Circular No. 27. May/June 1993. Division of Plant Industry. Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The plant is a noxious weed producing large, dense, prickly thickets that outcompete native plants and disturb wildlife habitat. It reduces the cattle carrying capacity of pasture land, costing ranchers millions of dollars in Florida alone. It is an alternate host for several viruses of crop plants, including cucumber mosaic virus, potato leafroll virus, potato virus Y, tobacco etch virus, and tomato mosaic virus. It hosts pest insects such as the silverleaf whitefly, Colorado potato beetle, tomato hornworm, tobacco hornworm, and southern green stinkbug. The beetle is host-specific. Studies have shown that it can only complete its life cycle on tropical soda apple. When offered over 120 other species of plants, the beetle fed lightly on only one of them and barely sampled three others, all Solanum species. It rarely laid eggs on any other plants, either. Eggplant, a Solanum crop, is not attacked by the beetle in its home range. Larvae always die when limited to native US Solanum species. The only other known natural host is the South American plant Solanum palinacanthum.Horner, T. A. (2003). Field release of a nonindigenous beetle, Gratiana boliviana (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), for biological control of tropical soda apple, Solanum viarum (Solanaceae). USDA APHIS. Its host specificity made the beetle a relatively safe choice for introduction. The larva of the beetle feeds on the upper third of the plant, damaging its leaves. The adult also feeds on the foliage. Feeding damage takes the form of holes in the leaves. The injury facilitates the entry of pathogens and causes stress to the plant, reducing its growth and fruit production.Diaz, R., et al. Gratiana boliviana. In: Shelton, A. (ed.) Biological Control: A Guide to Natural Enemies in North America. Cornell University. Accessed 21 July 2013. Larvae kept free of natural enemies can almost completely defoliate a plant. The beetle was released in Florida in 2003. As of 2010 it had become established in many areas there, and stands of tropical soda apple in these areas have been well defoliated, lower in fruit yield, thinned and replaced by other plants. No beetle damage has been noted on any other plant species.Medal, J. C. and J. P. Cuda. (2010). Establishment and initial impact of the leaf-beetle Gratiana boliviana (Chrysomelidae), first biocontrol agent released against tropical soda apple in Florida. Florida Entomologist 93(4) 493-500. This tropical beetle cannot develop where cold temperatures occur, so its establishment farther north will be limited. Ecology Many natural enemies of the beetle have been noted in Florida, including predators and parasitoids. Predators include the bug Geocoris punctipes, an assassin bug of genus Sinea, the shield bugs Perillus bioculatus and Stiretrus anchorago, the mirid bug Tupiocoris notatus, the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta), and the green lynx spider (Peucetia viridans). A number of parasitoids attack the pupa, including the chalcid wasps Conura side, Aprostocetus cassidis, and Brasema sp. Pathogens that can affect the beetle include the parasitic neogregarine protozoan Mattesia oryzaephili and a microsporidian of the genus Nosema. References Further reading *Gandolfo, D., et al.

Events of September 25, 2005 Photo related to Federico Aldrovandi homicide The incident occurred nearby Viale Ippodromo in Ferrara. At night, Aldrovandi was walking when he was stopped by two policemen, Enzo Pontani and Luca Pollastri. The stop was due to reports of night-time disturbances. The Police in their Alfa 3 patrol car blocked his progress. Aldrovandi had used some illegal drugs that night. The two policemen, claiming that they had been attacked without a reason, called for reinforcements. Two more officers, Paolo Forlani and Monica Segatto, arrived on patrol car Alfa 2. Together the four police officers handcuffed Aldrovandi, forced him against the ground. A violent assault followed. A combination of compression of Aldrovandi's chest and several blows led to the teen's demise. Only after 5 hours, was the family informed of his death. He received over fifty injuries, bruises, lacerations on various part of his body. He is not believed to have died of shock. The original official postulation was that Aldrovandi died from the drug consumption. After a long official silence and sidetracking, on November 2008 a photo uncovered by trial records showed that a cardiac hematoma in the region of Bundle of His was the likely contributor to his death. In addition, the compression of his chest while he was handcuffed and in prone position, led to asphyxia. Aldrovandi in addition had facial and cranial fractures. The first trial ended on 6 July 2009, with the conviction of the four police officers; they were found guilty of excesses and of acting imprudently given their numerical advantage and the use truncheon blows against several parts of the victim's body, beating him to floor and subsequently compressing his thorax, causing him to suffocate. The initial sentence was of 3 years and 6 months, but it was reduced due to the controversial pardon (indulto) issued in 2006 by the Italian Parliament, which subtracted 3 years of prison from all sentences. The guilty sentence was confirmed by Italian Supreme Court on 21 June 2012 (sentenza 36280).http://static.ilsole24ore.com/DocStore/Professionisti/AltraDocumentazione/body/13500001-13600000/13520777.pdf According to Supreme Court the condition of nervous excitement in which the boy had required a dialogue and restrained intervention but the four policemen dealt several blows at Aldrovandi indifferent to his call for help. It noted that Segatto dealt at his legs with truncheon, Pontani and Forlani crushed him to the ground, while Pollastri continued striking him. They exceeded lawfulness adopting an incautious and damaging conduct. The local prosecutors were also suspected of trying to cover culpability of the officers. The first report from the coroner maintained that the boy died because of heart disease caused by the struggle; it was later proved to be false. Legacy *As of February 13, 2014, the police officers have returned to their work. The family of Aldrovandi organized a protest in Ferrara for February 15, 2014,http://www.positive-magazine.com/reportage/vialadivisa/ claiming that according to Police regulations, the officers should be expelled. *On April 29, 2014 \\"a major police union in Italy has provoked outrage\\" after giving a five-minute standing ovation to three of the four officers convicted of the manslaughter of Federico. *A documentary about his story has been released in 2010 with the title \\"Un ragazzo in stato di morte\\" (\\"A young man in a state of death\\",A young man in a state of death, Patrizia, mother of Federico Aldrovandi, Beppe Grillo's Blog a pun about the responsibility of the state in the murder). *In July 2019, shortly after Federico's birthday, family members made the decision to close the non-profit making Associazione Federico Aldrovandi stating that public protest had run its course. Friends, however, stated that the memory of Federico will not be lost and confided in a common struggle against police brutality together with other cases such as that of Stefano Cucchi. *A flag bearing a portrait of Federico is waved by supporters at every match played by the local football team S.P.A.L., of which the young man was also a supporter.

In 2006, Greaves Motorsport, founded and run by Tim Greaves, entered the Le Mans Series (LMS) for the first time, running a Radical SR9 in conjunction with Radical, and competing under the Bruichladdich Radical banner. After four years of Ginetta- Zytek GZ09S/2 in 2010 to replace the old Radical SR9. In 2011, the team became known as Greaves Motorsport, and they switched to the new Zytek Z11SN, winning the LMP2 category of both the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the Le Mans Series. For 2012, they entered the new European Le Mans Series (ELMS) and FEndurance Championship (WEC), finishing third in the LMP2 category of the ELMS, and fifth in the WEC. History =2006‚Äì2007= In 2006, it was announced that Greaves Motorsport would be running the works Radical team in the Le Mans Series (LMS), with Tim Greaves and Stuart Moseley driving a LMP2-class Radical SR9-AER under the Bruichladdich Radical banner. The team entered the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, and finished fifteenth overall, fifth in class. Ben Devlin joined the team for the following round, the 1000 km of Donington, but the team retired after 151 laps. Following this race, the team entered Greaves, Moseley, Ben Devlin and Colin McRae in the inaugural round of the Radical World Cup. McRae's weekend proved unsuccessful, as he retired from the first race, and finished eleventh in the second. Having returned to the LMS, the team retired from the season's final race, the 1000 km of Jarama, after 27 laps. Following this, Moseley and Michael Vergers were entered in the American Le Mans Series season finale at Laguna Seca, where they finished 22nd, and fifth in class. The Bruichladdich Radical SR9-AER at the 2007 1000 km of Silverstone. In 2007, Bruichladdich Radical competed in the entire LMS season. Having retired at the opening event, the 1000 km of Monza, the team took a ninth place overall finish and third in class at the 1000 km of Valencia; in the latter race, Greaves and Moseley were joined by Robin Liddell. Following this event, the team participated in the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time, however, Tim Greaves crashed out after 90 minutes, forcing the team to withdraw. The following LMS race, which was the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, was little more successful; Greaves and Moseley finished 35th, and ninth in class, after a starter motor problem had cost the team around 30 minutes. A retirement at the 1000 km of Spa followed, due to engine failure after 81 laps, before the season finale, the 1000 km of Silverstone saw the team take 14th overall and seventh in class; Jacob Greaves filling the third driver's slot for the team. The team finished joint-eighth in the LMP2 team's standings; level with Team LNT and Kruse Motorsport on eight points. =2008‚Äì2009= Bruichladdich Radical remained in the Le Mans Series in 2008, but had an all-new driver line-up of Jens Petersen, Jan-Dirk Leuders and Marc Rostan. The season opener, which was the 1000 km of Catalunya, saw the team finish 15th overall, and seventh in class. However, the rest of the season was unsuccessful, as the team did not finish above 30th overall in any of the remaining LMS races, or the 24 Hours of Le Mans; although 30th at the 1000 km of Spa equated to seventh in class, due to attrition. As a result, the team slipped to joint-eleventh in class, with four points. For 2009, Pierre Bruneau joined the team, and as a result, the team became known as the Bruichladdich- Bruneau Team, with the team continuing to use the AER-engined Radical SR9. The opening round of the season, which was the 1000 km of Catalunya, saw Bruneau, partnered by Moseley and Nigel Greensall, finishing tenth overall, and fourth in the LM P2 category. At the 1000 km of Spa, Tim Greaves and Jonathon Coleman replaced Moseley and Greensall, but the team were disqualified from the event for an unspecified technical infringement. Rostan partnered Greaves and Bruneau at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but retired from the race after just over fourteen and a half hours, having completed 91 laps. At the 1000 km of Algarve, Greaves and Bruneau were partnered by Francesco Sini, but could only finish 25th overall, and tenth in class. Michael Vergers replaced Greaves at the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, but the team retired after 114 laps.

The team's first race with the car came at the LMS opener, the 8 Hours of Castellet, and they finished twelfth overall, fifth in class. The 1000 km of Spa proved to be less successful; the team suffered a blown engine during qualifying, and Ebbesvik crashed out of the race after 15 laps. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Gary Chalandon replaced Ebbesvik, and the team finished tenth overall, fifth in the LM P2 class. Next up was the 1000 km of Algarve, and Ebbesvik returned to the team; fifth overall, and second in class, for their first class podium of the season. The 1000 km of Hungaroring saw another fifth place overall, although mechanical difficulties with the LM P1-class cars meant that this also equated to fifth in class. The season finale, which was the 1000 km of Silverstone, saw the team end the season with a 19th overall, and eighth in class. The team finished the season ranked fifth in the LMP2 Team's Championship, with 46 points.

Another eighth place overall, and class victory followed, at the 6 Hours of Imola; the team then won the LM P2 class for the third race in a row at the 6 Hours of Silverstone, this time finishing tenth overall. The team finished the season with a fourth overall, and second in class, at the 6 Hours of Estoril; this meant that the team won the LM P2 Championship, with Kimber-Smith and Ojjeh being crowned as the LM P2 Driver's Champions. =2012‚Äì2013= Ricardo Gonz√°lez at the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans in Zytek Z11SN In 2012, Greaves Motorsport entered both the European Le Mans Series (ELMS) and the new FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC). Kimber-Smith, Alex Brundle and Lucas Ord√≥√±ez were hired for the ELMS, whilst Elton Julian, Christian Zugel and Ricardo Gonz√°lez were hired for the WEC. The team's first event of the season came at the 12 Hours of Sebring, which formed part of the WEC and the American Le Mans Series (ALMS); the team finished seventh of the WEC runners, and fourth in the LMP2 category. The team then entered the opening round of the ELMS, which was the 6 Hours of Castellet; the team finished fourth overall, and in the LM P2 class. The next event the team entered was the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps, part of the WEC; the team finished 16th overall, and seventh in the LM P2 class. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Greaves Motorsport entered two cars; Zugel, Julian and Gonz√°lez in the No. 41 car, and Alex Brundle, Martin Brundle and Ord√≥√±ez in the No. 42 car. The No. 41 car finished 12th overall, and fifth in class, whilst the No. 42 car finished 15th overall, and eighth in class. Next, the team returned to the ELMS, competing in the 6 Hours of Donington, finishing seventh overall and in the LM P2 class. The team then entered both cars in the 6 Hours of Silverstone, with the same drivers that had competed in the 24 Hours of Le Mans; the No. 42 car finished 12th overall, and fifth in the LM P2 category, whilst the No. 41 car finished 20th overall, and 13th in class. Greaves Motorsport reverted to a single-car entry for the 6 Hours of S√£o Paulo round of the WEC, with Roberto Gonz√°lez replacing his brother Ricardo (whom had been selected to drive for Level 5 Motorsports instead); the team finished eleventh overall, and fourth in the LM P2 class. Ricardo Gonz√°lez returned to the team for the 6 Hours of Bahrain, and the team finished twelfth overall, seventh in the LMP2 category. The 6 Hours of Fuji was the team's next race, and they finished 14th overall, and seventh in class. Greaves Motorsport then entered the final race of the ELMS season, which was the Petit Le Mans (also part of the ALMS); Alex Brundle, Kimber-Smith and Alex Buncombe were selected to drive, and they finished 32nd overall, fifth in the P2 class.

The team started the 2013 season by entering the opening round of the ELMS, which was the 3 Hours of Silverstone on 13 April; the team retired after 23 laps. They then entered the 6 Hours of Silverstone, which was part of the WEC and held the following day; this time, the team finished eleventh overall, and fifth in class. The next event the team entered was the 6 Hours of Spa- Francorchamps, which was part of the WEC; however, the team withdrew from the event after Dyson crashed heavily in qualifying, leaving the car too damaged to race. The team then returned to the ELMS, and entered the 3 Hours of Imola; Kimber-Smith and David Heinemeier Hansson were selected to drive, and they finished fifth overall, and in class. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, Greaves Motorsport once again entered two cars; Kimber-Smith, Alexander Rossi and Eric Lux in the No. 41 car, whilst Ord√≥√±ez, Michael Krumm and Jann Mardenborough drove the No. 42 car. As Greaves Motorsport had signed a deal with Caterham, the No. 41 car was entered under the Caterham Motorsport banner. In the race, the No. 42 car proved to be the quicker of the two; Krumm, Mardenborough and Ord√≥√±ez finished ninth overall, and third in the LM P2 class, whilst the Caterham Motorsport car finished 23rd overall, and tenth in the LM P2 class. Although the team initially entered the Caterham-backed car in the 3 Hours of Red Bull Ring, part of the ELMS, they were forced to withdraw after they were unable to find any drivers to run; this was the first time the team had withdrawn from an ELMS event since their first race in the series, back in 2006. Zugel and Jeannette were partnered by Bj√∂rn Wirdheim for the 6 Hours of S√£o Paulo, which was part of the WEC; although they were running third at one point of the race, they eventually finished seventh overall, and fourth in the LM P2 category.

For the 6 Hours of Fuji, Greaves Motorsport announced a partnership with local Super GT team Gainer, which resulted in Gainer's Katsuyuki Hiranaka partnering Bj√∂rn Wirdheim and Masayuki Ueda; the combined effort was entered under the \\"Gainer International\\" banner. The race was halted at around the three-hour mark due to torrential rain, and the team were classified sixth overall, and third in class. The 6 Hours of Shanghai saw Greaves Motorsport hand Mark Shulzhitskiy his WEC debut, driving alongside Lux and Wirdheim; the trio took another fifth place in class for the team, and ninth overall. The final round of the WEC season, which was the 6 Hours of Bahrain, saw Wolfgang Reip make his debut in the series with Greaves Motorsport; he was partnered by fellow debutant Jon Lancaster and Wildheim. Despite the team's inexperience, they were able to finish third in the LM P2 class, and fifth overall. The team finished the year classified fifth in the LM P2 category of the WEC, with 81 points, and ninth in the ELMS, with ten points. =2014-2015= After colliding in the rain, Michael Munemann brings the damaged Greaves-Zytek down pit lane dragging a portion of the Murphy Prototypes bodywork beneath him. In 2014, Greaves Motorsport returned to the ELMS, once again campaigning two Zytek Z11SNs. After the team's failure to secure a guaranteed spot at the 2014 24 Hours of Le Mans, Caterham withdrew their backing of Greaves Motorsport. At the 4 Hours of Silverstone, the team fielded three ELMS and LM P2 category d√©butantes; Matt McMurry, James Littlejohn, and Tony Wells. It was to be a successful d√©but for all three drivers; McMurry, partnered by Dyson and Kimber-Smith, finished fourth, whilst Littlejohn and Wells were partnered by James Walker and finished sixth. Littlejohn had actually lead the race at one point, and both he and McMurry were nominated for \\"Driver of the Day\\" by Radio Le Mans. For the 4 Hours of Imola, Greaves entered one car, driven by Kimber- Smith and McMurry; for the second race in succession, they finished fourth. Greaves Motorsport had two entries at the 24 Hours of Le Mans; the #41 car, which was driven by James Winslow, Alessandro Latif and Michael Munemann under their own name, and the #42 car, which was driven by McMurry (who became the youngest ever competitor at the event), Dyson and Kimber-Smith under the Caterham Racing banner. Although the #41 car was forced to retire due to suspension damage after Munemann crashed, the #42 car was able to finish tenth in class, and 25th overall. Greaves Motorsport then returned to the ELMS for the 4 Hours of Red Bull Ring, where Luciano Bacheta and Mark Shulzhitskiy drove one car, and Kimber-Smith, Mark Patterson and McMurry drove the other; the two entries finished fourth and sixth respectively. The next race, which was the 4 Hours of Castellet, proved to be a mixed bag; whilst Shulzhitskiy and Bacheta were able to challenge for the lead before eventually finishing fifth, the car of McMurry and Johnny Mowlem crashed out of the race at the first corner. At the final race of the season, which was the 4 Hours of Estoril, the team had another mixed race; Shulzhitskiy and Bacheta were running third before an incident whilst lapping GT cars led to their eventual retirement, whilst McMurry, Miguel Faisca and James Fletcher took seventh place. Greaves Motorsport finished the season fourth in the LM P2 Team's standings, tied with Morand Racing on 68 points. On 16 December 2014, it was announced that Greaves Motorsport would be competing in the LM P2 class of both the ELMS and the FIA WEC for the 2015 season, subject to their application's approval, with Gibson Technology's updated version of the Zytek Z11SN, renamed as the Gibson 015S. =2015-2016= Greaves Motorsport achieved sixth place in the LM P2 class, and a top ten finish overall, in the team‚Äôs Nissan-powered Ligier JS P2 prototype during the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June 2016; three of their drivers completed 348 laps.

It aims to provide privacy, security and anonymity on the internet. The operating system consists of two virtual machines, a \\"Workstation\\" and a Tor \\"Gateway\\", running Debian GNU/Linux. All communications are forced through the Tor network to accomplish this. Design Whonix is based on Kicksecure, a hardened Debian derivative with anonymity packages installed on top.https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Kicksecure It is distributed as two virtual machine images: a \\"Gateway\\" and a \\"Workstation\\". These images are installed on a user-provided host operating system. Each VM image contains a customized GNU/Linux instance based on Debian. Updates are distributed via Tor using Debian's apt-get package manager. The supported virtualization engines are VirtualBox, Qubes OS, and Linux KVM. An \\"advanced\\" configuration uses two physically separate computers, with the Gateway running on the actual hardware of one of the computers, and the Workstation running in a VM hosted on the second. This protects against attacks on hypervisors at the cost of flexibility. Supported physical hardware platforms include the Raspberry Pi 3https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/Physical_Isolation#How_To_Install_Whonix- Gateway_.E2.84.A2_on_the_Raspberry_Pi_3_B_.28RPI3.29 and unofficial community efforts on the PowerPC workstation hardware, Talos, from Raptor Computinghttps://wiki.raptorcs.com/wiki/Whonix>. On first startup, each VM runs a check to ensure that the software is up to date. On every boot, the date and time are set correctly using the sdwdate secure time daemon that works over Tor's TCP protocol.https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Sdwdate The Gateway VM is responsible for running Tor, and has two virtual network interfaces. One of these is connected to the outside Internet via NAT on the VM host, and is used to communicate with Tor relays. The other is connected to a virtual LAN that runs entirely inside the host. The Workstation VM runs user applications. It is connected only to the internal virtual LAN, and can directly communicate only with the Gateway, which forces all traffic coming from the Workstation to pass through the Tor network. The Workstation VM can \\"see\\" only IP addresses on the Internal LAN, which are the same in every Whonix installation. User applications therefore have no knowledge of the user's \\"real\\" IP address, nor do they have access to any information about the physical hardware. In order to obtain such information, an application would have to find a way to \\"break out\\" of the VM, or to subvert the Gateway (perhaps through a bug in Tor or the Gateway's Linux kernel). The Web browser pre-installed in the Workstation VM is the modified version of Mozilla Firefox provided by the Tor Project as part of its Tor Browser package. This browser has been changed to reduce the amount of system-specific information leaked to Web servers. Since version 15, like Tails, Whonix supports an optional \\"amnesiac\\" live- mode.https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Whonix_Live This combines the best of both worlds by allowing Tor's entry guard system to choose long-lived entry points for the Tor network on the Gateway, reducing adversaries' ability to trap users by running malicious relays, while rolling back to a trusted state. Some precautions on the host may be needed to avoid data being written to the disk accidentally. Grub-live, an additional separate projecthttps://www.whonix.org/wiki/Grub-live, aims to allow bare-metal Debian hosts to boot into a live session, avoiding forensic remnants on disc. Additional testing to confirm the efficacy of the package is needed as of yet. For the best defense against malicious guards, it is recommended to boot up the gateway from a pristine state and have a unique guard paired to each user activity. Users would take a snapshot to be able to switch to and use that guard consistently. https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Tor_Entry_Guards#Increase_Protection_from_Malicious_Entry_Guards:_One_Guard_per_Application This setup guarantees that most activities of the user remain protected from malicious entry guards while not increasing the risk of running into one as a completely amnesiac system would. Scope Anonymity is a complex problem with many issues beyond IP address masking that are necessary to protect user privacy. Whonix focuses on these areas to provide a comprehensive solution. Some features: * Kloak - A keystroke anonymization tool that randomizes the timing between key presses. Keystroke biometric algorithms have advanced to the point where it is viable to fingerprint users based on soft biometric traits with extremely high accuracy. This is a privacy risk because masking spatial information -- such as the IP address via Tor -- is insufficient to anonymize users. * Tirdad - A Linux kernel module for overwriting TCP ISNs. TCP Initial Sequence Numbers use fine-grained kernel timer data, leaking correlatable patterns of CPU activity in non-anonymous system traffic. They may otherwise act as a side-channel for long running crypto operations.https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/16659#comment:10 * Disabled TCP Timestamps - TCP timestamps leak system clock info down to the millisecond which aids network adversaries in tracking systems behind NAT.https://web.archive.org/web/20170201160732/https://mailman.boum.org/pipermail/tails- dev/2013-December/004520.html * sdwdate - A secure time daemon alternative to NTP that uses trustworthy sources and benefits from Tor's end-to-end encryption. NTP suffers from being easy to manipulate and surveil. RCE flaws were also discovered in NTP clients.https://blog.hboeck.de/archives/863-Dont- update-NTP-stop-using-it.html * MAT 2 - Software and filesystems add a lot of extraneous information about who, what, how, when and where documents and media files were created. MAT 2 strips out this information to make it safer to share files without divulging identifying information about the source. * LKRG - Linux Kernel Runtime Guard (LKRG) is a Linux security module that thwarts classes of kernel exploitation techniques. Hardening the guest OS makes it more difficult for adversaries to break out of the hypervisor and deanonymize the user. Documentation The Whonix wiki includes a rich collection of operational security guides for tips on preserving anonymity while online. Additionally, a number of original content guides on what security tools to use and how, have been added over time. This includes how to access the I2Phttps://www.whonix.org/wiki/I2P and Freenethttps://www.whonix.org/wiki/Freenet networks over Tor.

These include friends and family of the group, the band's entourage, and numerous session musicians. Original members Pete Best (drums) and Stuart Sutcliffe (bass guitar) appeared on early recordings; the former on the group's recording of \\"My Bonnie\\" with Tony Sheridan, and both on various tracks released on Anthology 1. The instruments contributed to Beatles recordings range from traditional orchestral instruments‚Äîsuch as violin, viola and cello‚Äîto an alarm clock and a pile of gravel. The first half of the Beatles' career‚Äîfrom the early 1960s until 1966‚Äîrarely saw the band use any extra musicians, though George Martin (their producer) occasionally added keyboard instruments to augment their sound. As their career progressed and their influences widened, the group began to experiment in the studio. Martin started to orchestrate for the band; his first major orchestration for the group was the string quartet on \\"Yesterday\\". In 1966, the band stopped touring and concentrated on studio experimentation, creating soundscapes and orchestrations that required numerous musicians (the orchestra on 1967's \\"A Day in the Life\\" was accommodated in Abbey Road's large Studio One, rather than the group's usual room in Studio Two). It was also around this time that the Beatles visited India, and‚Äîparticularly Harrison‚Äîbecame influenced by Indian culture and music, leading to the group's use of traditional Indian instruments in their arrangements. Shortly before the group‚Äôs demise at the end of the decade, keyboardist Billy Preston was brought in to add to their sound while they tried to return to their rock 'n' roll roots. The group wanted what was to become their final album, Let It Be, to be raw with minimal overdubs. After producer Glyn Johns left the project, Phil Spector hired in numerous session musicians to provide orchestral overdubs, in contrast to the group's original back-to-basics ideas. Omissions There are occasions where details of session musicians' names and roles have been lost or were uncredited‚Äîthis is the case for the recordings of \\"Good Night\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\"; Phil Spector's orchestral overdubs for \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", \\"Across the Universe\\" and \\"I Me Mine\\"; the string sections on \\"Something\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", \\"Carry That Weight\\", \\"Golden Slumbers\\" and \\"The End\\"; the orchestra on \\"Hey Jude\\"; the saxophonists on \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La- Da\\"; the trumpeters and trombonists on \\"Mother Nature's Son\\"; the brass and string players on \\"Let It Be\\"; the cellist on \\"Blue Jay Way\\" and the Asian Music Circle musicians on \\"Love You To\\" (performing on sitar and tambura) and \\"Within You Without You\\" (performing on dilruba, swarmandal, tabla and tambura). In 1978, renowned session drummer Bernard Purdie claimed in an interview with Gig magazine that he had overdubbed drums for 21 Beatles recordings in the summer of 1963. He stated that Brian Epstein paid him a five-figure sum to overdub a drum track at Capitol Records' West 46th Street studios in New York City, and that the payment also bought his silence. Purdie has also implied that some guitar parts for early Beatles recordings were also overdubbed, and there are also suggestions that Purdie and Cornell Dupree overdubbed drums and guitar parts for the Tony Sheridan recordings. As none of these claims have been substantiated, they are omitted from this list. Also omitted from this list are the instances where people's voices are captured on the recordings, but do not constitute part of the musical performance, such as Geoff Emerick's announcement of \\"take two\\" at the beginning of \\"Revolution 1\\", and the various announcers, interviewers and presenters on Live at the BBC. Jimmie Nicol stood in for Starr for eight performances during the band's 1964 tour. He did not feature on record, but his performances were captured by audience bootlegs and broadcasts by AVRO in the Netherlands and 5DN in Australia. Indirect performances By the mid 1960s, the Beatles became interested in tape loops and found sounds. Early examples of the group sampling existing recordings include loops on \\"Revolution 9\\" (the repetitive \\"number nine\\" is from a Royal Academy of Music examination tape, some chatter is from a conversation between George Martin and Apple office manager Alistair Taylor, and a chord from a recording of Sibelius's Symphony No. 7 is also included) and \\"I Am the Walrus\\", which contained a radio broadcast of the BBC Third Programme's production of King Lear. The part of the broadcast included on the record features John Hollis as Oswald, John Rye as Edgar, and Brewster Mason as the Earl of Gloucester. For the introduction to \\"The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill\\", a stock Mellotron sample of a Spanish guitar was used. The recording, performed by an unknown guitarist, was supervised by Eric Robinson. A *Frederick Alexander‚Äîcellist; session musician.

Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies products and solutions are enabled by in-house manufacturing of micro-size to multi-kilowatt scale proton exchange membrane fuel cells, combined with a choice of proprietary on- demand hydrogen storage and production methods including hydrolysis, electrolysis and reformer-based solutions. Horizon has so far focused its efforts on the commercialization of sub-kW fuel cell solutions, which consume less hydrogen and thus rely less on the existence of a hydrogen station infrastructure to succeed in the market. By following an incremental strategy that centers around practical on-demand hydrogen fuel supply solutions with decreasing costs, Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies has grown to become the world's largest volume producer of fuel cells below 1000W, serving customers in over 65 countries with what is the widest selection of commercial products in the fuel cell industry. History In 2004, Horizon launches its first PEM fuel cell stacks with a focus on a simplified self-humidified air-breathing architecture, and begins a series of design and development iterations that reduce fuel cell costs by several orders of magnitude. H-RacerIn 2005, with the completion of a first low-cost single cell, Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies creates its first commercial micro-size fuel cell product, designed as a basic science experiment kit. Soon after, Horizon miniaturizes hydrogen fuel cell car together with a real-working solar hydrogen station, and launches the H-racer, which is named Transportation Best Invention of the year 2006 by Time and \\"One of 11 Coolest New Products On the Planet\\" by Business 2.0. This led to the progressive commercialization of over 30 energy-related science experiment products, and an alliance, in 2010, with 3D Classworks to promote greater environmental awareness for sustainable energy amongst students around the world in a joint program called Destination Zero Carbon. In 2013, Horizon launches i-H2GO, its latest hydrogen car miniature merging an iOS-enabled remote control APP, Horizon's latest hybrid micro-fuel cell power systems, and a USB enabled hydrogen station. In April 2007, Horizon's fuel cells are used to power the world's first unmanned zero-emission fuel cell powered jet-wing aircraft, and set a new FAI flight distance record in a 5 kg UAV developed by Calstate-LA backed by NASA and US Air Force Research Laboratory. In August, the 2007 Innovative Energy Technology Developer of the Year Award in the Asia Pacific region has been presented to Horizon Fuel Cell Technologies. 2008 sees the unveiling at the Consumer Electronics Show of a first on-demand hydrogen enabled portable fuel cell named HYDROPAK representing the start of Horizon's chemical hydrolysis cartridge research and development. Horizon also begins works on the world's lowest cost reversible metal hydride which led to the commercialization of Hydrostik cartridges. Together with Hydrostik, and a metal hydride charging station named Hydrofill, Horizon introduces a palm-size micro portable fuel cell USB power supply named MinipakThe Minipak at the 2009 Consumer Electronics Show. It wins 2012 Gadget of the Year status for GameKritik and was acclaimed by renewable industry specialists. During the same year, and following a string of small Horizon-enabled fuel cell electric aircraft flight tests in the US and Europe, Horizon launches a separate subsidiary in Singapore named Horizon Energy Systems (HES), and in 2010 unveils a first 450Wh/kg battery alternative prototype named Aeropak. HES is now aiming to exceed 1000Wh/kg with its latest on-demand hydrogen technologies. In 2010, BOC (now part of Linde Group) introduced a Horizon-made 150 W portable fuel cell power supply named Hymera which begins sales in the United Kingdom. It is used in a variety of low-energy, high-efficiency applications such as construction and railway maintenance ‚Äì and increasingly in off-the-grid lighting projects. In 2012, Horizon starts to work on hydrocarbon to hydrogen steam reforming, with a commercial product launch of stationary solutions planned in 2014. 2013 sees the launch of Hydromax VRLA battery charger for recreational vehicles and yachts. as well as Aquigen, a scalable 200W-50 kW back-up power system for telecom, datacenters, and security solutions. In January, The Fuel cell-powered H-Rover is unveiled at the Nuremberg International Toy Fair. The Hydropak is launched. representing a breakthrough 9%Wt hydrogen storage method. Products Horizon's technology platform has three main parts: PEM fuel cells (micro-fuel cells and stacks) and their materials, hydrogen supply (electrolysis, reforming and hydrolysis) as well as hydrogen storage and pressure related devices. From this platform, stem several market-focused business units within the company, with their own lines of commercial products. Fuel cell stacks are offered in three ranges:The Hydrofill * standard off-the-shelf PEM fuel cell systems available from 10W to 5 kW, as well as customized fuel cell system configurations up to 150 kW * premium H-1000XP 1 kW stacks which has achieved a peak efficiency of 59% during real test with one of the teams at Shell Eco-Marathon in Asia. * Ultra- light and compact Aerostacks from 200W to 1000W. fuel cell powered Hydrocar Educational products and kits. Started in 2005 with a toy car used to demonstrate a newly invented thin-film micro-fuel cell. In 2010, Horizon won an international tender to supply the US National Science Competition with a fast-moving fuel cell car kit used in a competitive racing format. This led to the start of Destination Zero Carbon, a global STEM education program. The South African Agency for Science and Technology and the National Research Foundation have put together a video about the importance of making Science fun to boost research. Horizon's H-CELL product is featured in the video In May 2013, French Minister of Industry, Fr√©d√©ric Cuvillier hands out the Saint Jo 24 hour race's trophy cup specially made for this challenge, which was to keep a hydrogen-powered car using rain water, with hydrolysis done by solar panels, working under competitive conditions for 24 hours non-stop. The winning car was powered by Horizon Fuel Cell. It was the first time that a hydrogen powered car finished the 24 hour race, a one-tenth replica of 24 Hours of Le Mans for radio-controlled car. Portable fuel cells are designed to offer the benefit of long duration, clean electric power generation in various off-grid emergency situations. They are declined in: *Minipak for cellphones, smartphones, GPS handhelds, Go-Pro type cameras or MP3 players *Hydropak (50 kW - 100 kW), easy to carry anywhere, with no harmful emissions, quiet and with ready-to-use energy cartridges with unlimited storage life *Hydromax, a deep cycle battery capacity extender for recreational use (RV, yachting) Stationary backup power are developed internally or with integrators and partners seeking to develop cost-effective solutions. The transport division works closely with integration partners that cater both to the car industry (supplying fuel cells to the Riversimple Urban Car or Microcab) and offers an Electric Bike Kit, a plug and play hydrogen fuel cell system designed to hybridise with existing electric bikes. The aerospace division focuses on lightweight alternatives to batteries, where fuel cell systems combined with high performance hydrogen generators increase electric flight durations by several orders of magnitude.

Physiographic regions The terrain of the Gaza Strip is flat or rolling, with dunes near the coast. The highest point is Abu 'Awdah (Joz Abu 'Auda), at above sea level. The terrain of the West Bank is mostly rugged dissected upland, with some vegetation in the west, but somewhat barren in the east. The elevation span reaches from a low on the northern shore of the Dead Sea at below sea level, to the highest point at Mount Nabi Yunis at above sea level.A house demolished, three others threatened in the town of Halhul - 24,March,2007 , POICA. Retrieved 14 October 2012. The area of the West Bank is landlocked; the highlands are the main recharge area for Israel's coastal aquifers. Geology The coastal plain of Gaza is composed of sand dunes and fertile sandy sediments. Except for a porous calcareous sandstone called kurkar in Arabic, there are no other rocks in this region. In contrast, the West Bank is dominated by low mountains: Mount Gerizim (881m), Nabi Samwil (890m), and Mount Scopus (826m). The rocks are principally composed of marine sediments (limestone and dolomite). The porosity of these rocks permits water to filter down to the non-porous strata, which supply water to the numerous aquifers in the region. =Tectonics and seismic activity= The Jordan Valley is a segment of the Dead Sea Transform, a continuation of the Great Rift Valley which separates the African Plate from the Arabian Plate. The entire segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly, for instance during the earthquake of 749 and again in 1033, the most recent major earthquake along this structure. The deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of Mw~7.4. The tectonic disposition of Palestine on the margin of the Dead Sea Transform has left it exposed to relatively frequent earthquakes, the most destructive of which were those of 31 BCE, 363, 749, and 1033. For a detailed list see here. Rivers and lakes The River Jordan is the largest river in Palestine, forming the eastern boundary of the West Bank, until it flows into the Dead Sea. Friends of the Earth Middle East reports that on the one hand up to 96% of the river's fresh water is diverted by Israel, Jordan and Syria, while on the other hand large quantities of untreated sewage are being discharged into the river. The Dead Sea is the largest body of water in Palestine, while the valley of Marj Sanur forms a seasonal lake. A number of ephemeral streams, in Arabic called wadis, flow into the Jordan River or Dead Sea through the West Bank, including Wadi Og, Wadi Fa'rah and Wadi Qelt. Others flow through Israel and into the Mediterranean Sea, such as Hadera Stream and Wadi Kabiba. Climate The climate in the West Bank is mostly Mediterranean, slightly cooler at elevated areas compared with the shoreline, west to the area. In the east, the West Bank includes much of the Judean Desert including the western shoreline of the Dead Sea, characterised by dry and hot climate. Gaza has a hot semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen: BSh) with mild winters and dry hot summers. Spring arrives around March‚ÄìApril and the hottest months are July and August, with the average high being . The coldest month is January with temperatures usually at . Rain is scarce and generally falls between November and March, with annual precipitation rates approximately at . Natural resources Natural resources of Palestine include mud extracts from the Dead Sea, such as magnesium, potash and bromine. However, these resources are monopolised by Israeli settlements; the Palestinian policy network Al- Shabaka reported in 2015 that the added value access to these natural resources could have delivered to the economy was $918 million per annum. Palestine also includes many rich gas fields in the maritime zone of the Gaza Strip; however, since these were discovered in the year 2000, they have not been exploited, due to Israel restricting the maritime zone of Gaza from 3 to 6 nautical miles offshore as part of the blockade of the Gaza Strip. Environment Palestine has a number of environmental issues; issues facing the Gaza Strip include desertification; salination of fresh water; sewage treatment; water-borne diseases; soil degradation; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources. In the West Bank, many of the same issues apply; although fresh water is much more plentiful, access is restricted by the ongoing occupation of Palestine.http://www.alhaq.org/publications/Water-For-One-People-Only.pdf See also * Tourism in Palestine References * Category:Geography of the Middle East by country Category:Geography of Western Asia by country ","title":"Geography of the State of Palestine"},{"id":"40029778","text":"K.

After World War I, Munzinger became a supporter of the growing National Socialist movement in his home country, Latvia. In 1933, the Latvian government expelled his family and he moved to Berlin. At the start of World War II, Munzinger was drafted into counterintelligence under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, where he came into contact with the growing anti-Nazi group around Hans Oster and Hans von Dohnanyi. After the unsuccessful assassination attempt of 20 July 1944, he was arrested by the Gestapo and held in Lehrter Stra√üe prison, Berlin. On the night of April 22‚Äì23, 1945, just a few hours before his scheduled release, a special detachment from the Reich Security Main Office murdered him and other prisoners at nearby factory grounds. Early life Munzinger, son of a brewer, on leaving school wanted to be a journalist. He emigrated in accordance with the wishes of his father, in 1883 from Zweibr√ºcken (Germany) to Riga (Latvia). He began studying law at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In 1910, he became a member of the Corps Isaria. He broke off his studies, enlisted in the Bavarian Army and served with the Royal Bavarian Infantry Regiment ‚ÄúPrince William of Hohenzollern,‚Äù No. 22 in Zweibr√ºcken. After the outbreak of the First World War, Munzinger's family was expelled from the Russian Empire and moved to Berlin. Munzinger was initially on the Western Front and later an intelligence officer on the Eastern Front. Munzinger reached the rank of captain and was awarded two Iron Crosses. Career After the war, he went back to Riga together with his father. Munzinger married in 1920. The marriage produced a son and a daughter. Munzinger built a chemical factory in Riga after the completion of commercial training. After the takeover by the Nazis in the German Empire, he was expelled because he openly sympathized with National Socialism. Munzinger moved with his family in 1933 to Berlin, where he led with his brother in law, the Department of Clothing and Textiles. After Kristallnacht, Munzinger averted from National Socialism because of the riots against the Jews. During the Second World War, Munzinger was at the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht (OKW) and worked as an intelligence officer in the Abwehr under Wilhelm Canaris. Munzinger came later in contact with the resistance group led by Hans von Dohnanyi and Hans Oster. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the spring of 1944, and ended his service in the Wehrmacht, returning to civilian life. Munzinger was already at that time informed about the planned assassination of 20 July 1944, but his role in the preparations is unknown. Death After the failure of the assassination attempt of 20 July 1944, Munzinger was arrested by members of the SS in Salzburg and sent to the Lehrterstrasse prison in Berlin. During the Battle of Berlin, Munzinger was shot together with 14 other Resistance fighters during the night of April 1945 by Gestapo members at a nearby factory premises in the Invalidenstrasse. His body was buried in a mass grave in Alt-Moabit, but later transferred to the St. Paul's Cemetery in Berlin-Pl√∂tzensee. Personal life On 12 September 1920, Munzinger married Senta Blenck in Riga, Latvia.

Biography Aharon (Aarele / Aarale) Ben Arieh was born in Haifa in 1955, and today his home and work base are in Moshav Tzafririm in the Ella Valley region.Israel Museum Information Center He grew up in Kiryat Gat. From an early age, he was drawn to sculpture and spent his free time in his father's workshop for farming equipment, training in metalwork. After completing his IDF military service in the Airborne Nahal battalion, he joined his friends at Kibbutz Kerem Shalom, where he set up a sculpture studio and a workshop for the development and improvement of agricultural machinery. In the early 1980s, Ben Arieh developed close ties with potters and carpenters in the Gaza Strip. He worked alongside them as an apprentice and considered them his guides and mentors in art. He drew inspiration from Palestinian material culture, the unique colorful paintings of pilgrims returning from Mecca and the vast expanses of sand dunes. He also studied under sculptor Moshe Shek (Jook) and painter Rafi Mintz. Art career Ben Arieh creates outdoor sculptures that create points of contact between the public and the environment. He specializes in projects that invite physical interaction such as sculpture playgrounds, park shades and public seating. \\"His point of origin is anchored in the material, or rather in the point where the material and the concept meet. The what and how go hand in hand. His pieces consist of dozens of interconnected elements which join to form one flawlessly shaped whole...\\" (Izika Gaon, Curator of the Israel Museum, at the opening of ‚ÄúThe Concept in the Material‚Äù exhibition, 1987). Ben Arieh calls himself ‚ÄúThe Place Doctor.\\" The artist first creates small sculptures, and then reproduces them on a larger scale to finally place them in vast environments. This has allowed him to go beyond his limits and to realize, to this day, some of his most important artworks. His work strives for simplicity and precision that nonetheless makes a powerful statement. Using natural materials, he creates sculptures which make people feel comfortable in their natural environment. \\"I endeavor for graceful truth that encourages forgiveness. My pieces offer a personal experience in both the private and public domain.‚Äù Motion and playfulness are central themes in Ben Arieh's indoor pieces as well as his outdoor work. Thus, he invites the audience to communicate physically and unmediated with his work.

The film stars Paul Walker, Genesis Rodriguez, TJ Hassan, Shane Jacobsen, and Judd Lormand. The film premiered on March 10, 2013 at the South by Southwest Film Festival in the Topfer Theatre in Austin, Texas. It went on general release on December 13, 2013, in which it was considered a posthumous release after Paul Walker's death on November 30, 2013.  Plot  In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina strikes New Orleans, Nolan Hayes rushes his wife Abigail Hayes to the emergency room as she is in labor five weeks early. The doctor explains to Nolan that his wife gave birth to a baby girl but lost her life in the process due to liver failure. Nolan refuses to accept her death and is in grief. He then learns that his newborn baby needs to be kept in a ventilator for the next two days before she can breathe on her own. The only problem is that the hurricane is beginning to flood the hospital and the ventilator can't be moved. When the hurricane becomes too strong, everyone in the hospital, including the doctors and nurses, evacuate the building, leaving only Nolan and his baby (who he names Abigail, after her mother) in the empty hospital. One of the nurses promises to bring back help and leaves, because Nolan is unwilling to abandon his baby. The power then goes out and Nolan is forced to find a way to keep his baby alive. He finds a hand-cranked generator in a storeroom and is able to manually charge the ventilator battery, but it only holds a charge for three minutes. He also finds some more I.V.s for the baby to keep her nourished, and some food and drinks for him to stay alive as well. With each charge the battery life gets shorter. Using only that amount of time, Nolan tries to juggle trying to get help outside of the hospital and rushing to help his baby before her timer runs out. Sometimes, Nolan sits down with his baby and tells the story about how he met her mother, to help keep himself preoccupied. (The two met after stopping a bank robbery together.) After this, Nolan finds a stray dog hiding in the hospital and takes care of it. He names the dog Sherlock while also having illusions of talking with his late wife. Nolan goes to the rooftop to find helicopters flying around the building. When he tries to signal one, criminals distract it by shooting at it, demanding to be rescued first. This leaves Nolan furious, but he has to return to his daughter to charge the battery before he can do more. Nolan manages to also find an ambulance on a flooded street outside. He calls for help using the ambulance's radio, but can't wait for a reply when he has to return to the room to charge the battery. Nolan attempts to find a spare battery, but has no luck. After running back upstairs and charging the battery, he returns and finds a generator in a flooded basement room, but it is ruined from water, and almost electrocutes him. Nolan barely returns to the room in time to charge the battery again. Despite being awake for over 36 hours without power and running low on food, (his hand cut from cranking the generator), Nolan continues to come up with more clever ways to charge the battery (i.e. using his foot and later a rod). He also plays games with Sherlock, like playing fetch with him and sharing his lunch meat given to him by one of the hospital cooks. Looters soon start to break into the hospital and steal food, drug and saline water for the baby. One comes in Nolan's room and tries to steal food but gets attacked by Sherlock, who runs him off. Nolan later realizes that this man had robbed and killed the nurse who was bringing back supplies (as she promised earlier). Since he hasn't slept in almost two days, Nolan takes a shot of some adrenaline to keep himself awake. Two more looters later break in the hospital and try to steal drugs to get high with and sell. When Nolan finds that they are both armed with guns, Nolan takes two shots of the adrenaline and sneaks up on one, injecting him with it and giving him a fatal overdose. Nolan takes his Marlin 336 lever-action rifle and surprises the other thug, who has discovered his baby. Nolan shakes his head \\"no\\" while holding the rifle on him, trying to get him to leave them alone. However, the man tries to shoot Nolan in revenge so Nolan shoots him in the head, vowing to his daughter that he will let no one hurt her. Nolan is now so exhausted he cannot crank it with his hand any longer. Nolan has to use both his hands to slowly crank the handle, but breaks it off accidentally. Nolan's attempts to fix the crank generator fails, so he gives his child mouth-to- mouth resuscitation to keep her alive. Before he can do any more, Nolan passes out from shock, stress, and exhaustion. Nolan then hears the ventilator beeping; it is running out of power. However, he is too weak to get back up. Nolan accepts that he has failed his child. But Sherlock comes to his aid and brings two paramedics with him to save Nolan, and drag him out. When Nolan wakes up, the paramedics hear his baby crying and run off to find her. Abigail has finally learned to breathe on her own. The paramedics give Nolan his baby and the two embrace, with Nolan crying tears of joy as they are brought to safety.

Scottish literature in the Middle Ages is literature written in Scotland, or by Scottish writers, between the departure of the Romans from Britain in the fifth century, until the establishment of the Renaissance in the late fifteenth century and early sixteenth century. It includes literature written in Brythonic, Scottish Gaelic, Scots, French and Latin. Much of the earliest Welsh literature was actually composed in or near the country now called Scotland, in the Brythonic speech, from which Welsh would be derived. This includes the epic poem The Gododdin, considered the earliest surviving verse from Scotland. Very few works of Gaelic poetry survive from the early Medieval period, and most of these are extant in Irish manuscripts. There are religious works that can be identified as Scottish. In Old English there is the Dream of the Rood, from which lines are found on the Ruthwell Cross, making it the only surviving fragment of Northumbrian Old English from early Medieval Scotland. What is probably the most important work written in early Medieval Scotland, the Vita Columbae by Adomn√°n, was also written in Latin. As the state of Alba developed into the Kingdom of Scotland from the eighth century, a flourishing literary elite there regularly produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin, sharing a common literary culture with Ireland and elsewhere. It is possible that much Middle Irish literature was written in Medieval Scotland, but has not survived because the Gaelic literary establishment of eastern Scotland died out before the fourteenth century. After the Davidian Revolution of the thirteenth century, a flourishing French language culture predominated, while Norse literature was produced from areas of Scandinavian settlement. In the late Middle Ages, Middle Scots became the dominant language of the country. The first surviving major text in Scots literature is John Barbour's Brus (1375). This was followed by major historical works in Latin, including the Chronica Gentis Scotorum of John of Fordun. There were also Scots versions of popular French romances. Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court. Many of the makars had a university education and so were also connected with the Church. Much of their work survives in a single collection: the Bannatyne Manuscript, collated around 1560. In the late fifteenth century, Scots prose also began to develop as a genre. The first complete surviving work is John Ireland's The Meroure of Wyssdome (1490). The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Gavin Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados, which was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglic language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden in the same year. Early Middle Ages The runic inscription on the Ruthwell Cross similar to the Anglo-Saxon poem the Dream of the Rood After the collapse of Roman authority in the early fifth century, four major circles of political and cultural influence emerged in Northern Britain. In the East were the Picts, whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the River Forth to Shetland. Modern scholarship, based on surviving place names and historical evidence, indicates that the Pictish language was Brythonic (British).J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia (ABC-CLIO, 2006), , p. 305. In the West were the Gaelic (Goidelic-speaking) people of D√°l Riata, who had close links with Ireland, from where they brought with them the name Scots. In the south were the British (Brythonic-speaking) descendants of the peoples of the Roman- influenced kingdoms of \\"The Old North\\", the most powerful and longest surviving of which was the Kingdom of Strathclyde. Finally, there were the English or \\"Angles\\", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of Bernicia (later the northern part of Northumbria), which reached into what are now the Borders of Scotland in the south-east.J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, The Medieval State: essays presented to James Campbell (London: Continuum, 2000), , p. 48. To these languages Christianisation, particularly from the sixth century, added Latin as an intellectual and written language. No written literature for the Picts has survived into the modern era. However, there is surviving literature from what would become Scotland in Brythonic, Gaelic, Old English and Latin. Much of the earliest Welsh literature was actually composed in or near the country now called Scotland, in the Brythonic speech, from which Welsh would be derived. At this time it was not then confined to Wales and Cornwall. These works were only written down in Wales much later. These include The Gododdin, considered the earliest surviving verse from Scotland, which is attributed to the bard Aneirin, said to have been resident in Bythonic kingdom of Gododdin in the sixth century. It is a series of elegies to the men of Gododdin killed fighting at the Battle of Catraeth around 600 AD. Similarly, the Battle of Gwen Ystrad is attributed to Taliesin, traditionally thought to be a bard at the court of Rheged in roughly the same period.R. T. Lambdin and L. C. Lambdin, Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature (London: Greenwood, 2000), , p. 508. Very few works of Gaelic poetry survive from the early Medieval period, and most of these are in Irish manuscripts.Koch, Celtic Culture, p. 1576. There are religious works that can be identified as Scottish, including the Elegy for St Columba by Dallan Forgaill (c. 597) and \\"In Praise of St Columba\\" by Beccan mac Luigdech of Rum, c. 677.Koch, Celtic Culture, p. 999. A series of anecdotes contained in the tenth century Betba Adamn√°in (Life of St. Adomn√°n) are probably derived from works composed on Iona. Outside of these there are a few poems in praise of Pictish kings contained within Irish annals that are probably from Scotland. In Old English there is the Dream of the Rood, from which lines are found on the Ruthwell Cross, making it the only surviving fragment of Northumbrian Old English from early Medieval Scotland.E. M. Treharne, Old and Middle English c.890-c.1400: an Anthology (Wiley- Blackwell, 2004), , p. 108. It has also been suggested on the basis of ornithological references that the poem The Seafarer was composed somewhere near the Bass Rock in East Lothian.T. O. Clancy, \\"Scottish literature before Scottish literature\\", in G. Carruthers and L. McIlvanney, eds, The Cambridge Companion to Scottish Literature (Cambridge Cambridge University Press, 2012), , p. 16. Early works in Latin include a \\"Prayer for Protection\\" attributed to St Mugint, thought to be from the mid-sixth century, and Altus Prosator (\\"The High Creator\\"), attributed to St Columba (c. 597).I. Brown, T. Owen Clancy, M. Pittock, S. Manning, eds, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: From Columba to the Union, until 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 94. What is probably the most important work written in early Medieval Scotland, the Vita Columbae, by Adomn√°n, abbot of Iona (627/8‚Äì704), was also written in Latin.C. Gross, The Sources and Literature of English History from the Earliest Times to about 1485 (Elibron Classics Series, 1999), , p. 217. The next most important piece of Scottish hagiography, the verse Life of St. Ninian, was written in Latin in Whithorn, perhaps as early as the eighth century.Clancy, \\"Scottish literature before Scottish literature\\", p. 19. High Middle Ages Beginning in the later eighth century, Viking raids and invasions may have forced a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns. The Kingdom of Alba emerged, which would eventually become known as the Kingdom of Scotland, and traced its origin to C√≠naed mac Ailp√≠n (Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s through the House of Alpin.B. Yorke, The Conversion of Britain: Religion, Politics and Society in Britain c.600‚Äì800 (Pearson Education, 2006), , p. 54. The Kingdom of Alba was overwhelmingly an oral society dominated by Gaelic culture. Fuller sources for Ireland of the same period suggest that there would have been filidh, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge and culture in Gaelic to the next generation.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 76. Historical sources, as well as place name evidence, indicate the ways in which the Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse.W. O. Frazer and A. Tyrrell, Social Identity in Early Medieval Britain (London: Continuum, 2000), , p. 238. Picture from a fourteenth-century illuminated manuscript of the Roman de Fergus From the eleventh century French, Flemish and particularly English became the main languages of Scottish burghs, most of which were located in the south and east.K. J. Stringer, \\"Reform Monasticism and Celtic Scotland\\", in E. J. Cowan and R. A. McDonald, eds, Alba: Celtic Scotland in the Middle Ages (East Lothian: Tuckwell Press, 2000), , p. 133. At least from the accession of David I (r. 1124‚Äì53), as part of a Davidian Revolution that introduced French culture and political systems, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court and was probably replaced by French. After this \\"de-gallicisation\\" of the Scottish court, a less highly regarded order of bards took over the functions of the filidh, and they would continue to act in a similar role in the Highlands and Islands into the eighteenth century. They often trained in bardic schools. A few of these, like the one run by the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were bards to the Lord of the Isles,K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 220. continued until they were suppressed from the seventeenth century. Members of bardic schools were trained in the complex rules and forms of Gaelic poetry. Much of their work was never written down, and what survives was only recorded from the sixteenth century.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: A History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), . It is possible that more Middle Irish literature was written in Medieval Scotland than is often thought, but has not survived because the Gaelic literary establishment of eastern Scotland died out before the fourteenth century. Thomas Owen Clancy has argued that the Lebor Bretnach, the so-called \\"Irish Nennius\\", was written in Scotland, and probably at the monastery in Abernethy, but this text survives only from manuscripts preserved in Ireland.T. O. Clancy, \\"Scotland, the 'Nennian' recension of the Historia Brittonum, and the Lebor Bretnach\\", in S. Taylor, ed., Kings, Clerics and Chronicles in Scotland, 500‚Äì1297 (Dublin/Portland, 2000), , pp. 87‚Äì107. Other literary works that have survived include that of the prolific poet Gille Brighde Albanach. His Heading for Damietta (c. 1218) dealt with his experiences of the Fifth Crusade.T. O. Clancy and G. M√°rkus, The Triumph Tree: Scotland's Earliest Poetry, 550‚Äì1350 (Canongate Books, 1998), , pp. 247‚Äì283. The twelfth century, a period that saw the arrival of new religious orders and changes in the structure of the church, was the highpoint of Scottish hagiography. There was a proliferation of Latin lives of the saints, often venerating early Celtic and Scottish figures, and the creation or embellishment of foundations myths for religious centres including St. Andrews, Glasgow and Dunkeld. Many earlier saints' lives are preserved in the Aberdeen Breviary (1509‚Äì10), compiled for William Elphinstone, Archbishop of Aberdeen. Two facsimiles of the Book of the Dean of Lismore In the thirteenth century, French flourished as a literary language and produced the Roman de Fergus, the earliest piece of non-Celtic vernacular literature to survive from Scotland.M. Fry, Edinburgh (London: Pan Macmillan, 2011), . Many other stories in the Arthurian Cycle, written in French and preserved only outside Scotland, are thought by some scholars, including D. D. R. Owen, to have been written in Scotland. There is some Norse literature from areas of Scandinavian settlement, such as the Northern and Western Isles. The famous Orkneyinga Saga however, although it pertains to the Earldom of Orkney, was written in Iceland.Clancy and M√°rkus, The Triumph Tree: Scotland's Earliest Poetry, 550‚Äì1350, pp. 7‚Äì8. In addition to French, Latin was a literary language with works that include the \\"Carmen de morte Sumerledi\\", a poem which exults the victory of the citizens of Glasgow over Somairle mac Gilla Brigte,I. F. Grant, The Lordship of the Isles: Wanderings in the Lost Lordship (Mercat, 1982), , p. 495. and the \\"Inchcolm Antiphoner\\", a hymn in praise of St. Columba.I. Bradley, Columba: Pilgrim and Penitent, 597‚Äì1997 (Wild Goose, 1996), , p. 97. Late Middle Ages In the late Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the dominant language of the country. It was derived largely from Old English, with the addition of elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century onwards.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 60‚Äì7. As the ruling elite gradually abandoned French, they began to adopt Middle Scots, and by the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I (1406‚Äì37) onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline. Lowland writers began to treat Gaelic as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands. The major corpus of Medieval Scottish Gaelic poetry, The Book of the Dean of Lismore was compiled by the brothers James and Donald MacGregor in the early decades of the sixteenth century. Beside Scottish Gaelic verse it contains a large number of poems composed in Ireland as well verse and prose in Scots and Latin. The subject matter includes love poetry, heroic ballads and philosophical pieces. It also is notable for containing poetry by at least four women.J. T. Koch and A. Minard, The Celts: History, Life, and Culture (ABC-CLIO, 2012), , pp. 262‚Äì3. These include Aithbhreac Nighean Coirceadail (f. 1460), who wrote a lament for her husband, the constable of Castle Sween.Koch and Minard, The Celts: History, Life, and Culture, pp. 33‚Äì4. James I, who spent much of his life imprisoned in England, where he gained a reputation as a musician and poet The first surviving major text in Scots literature is John Barbour's Brus (1375), composed under the patronage of Robert II and telling the story in epic poetry of Robert I's actions before the English invasion until the end of the war of independence.A. A. M. Duncan, ed., The Brus (Canongate, 1997), , p. 3. The work was extremely popular among the Scots-speaking aristocracy, and Barbour is referred to as the father of Scots poetry, holding a similar place to his contemporary Chaucer in England.N. Jayapalan, History of English Literature (Atlantic, 2001), , p. 23. Major historical works in Latin included the Chronica Gentis Scotorum of John of Fordun (before 1360‚Äìc. 1384), which would provide the basis for later historical writing, including Walter Bower's (c. 1385‚Äì1449) continuation known as Scotichronicon and the Humanist works like that of Hector Boece (1465‚Äì1536).R. Tittler and N. Jones, A Companion to Tudor Britain (John Wiley & Sons, 2008), , p. 410. In the early fifteenth century, Scots historical works included Andrew of Wyntoun's verse Orygynale Cronykil of Scotland and Blind Harry's The Wallace, which blended historical romance with the verse chronicle. They were probably influenced by Scots versions of popular French romances that were also produced in the period, including The Buik of Alexander, Launcelot o the Laik, The Porteous of Noblenes by Gilbert Hay and Greysteil, which would remain popular through the late sixteenth century. Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court, which included James I, who wrote the extended poem The Kingis Quair. Many of the makars had university education and so were also connected with the Kirk; however William Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c. 1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk, now largely lost.A. Grant, Independence and Nationhood, Scotland 1306‚Äì1469 (Baltimore: Edward Arnold, 1984), , pp. 102‚Äì3. Writers such as Dunbar, Robert Henryson, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas have been seen as creating a golden age in Scottish poetry. Major works include Richard Holland's satire the Buke of the Howlat (c. 1448). Much of their work survives in a single collection, the Bannatyne Manuscript collated by George Bannatyne (1545‚Äì1608) around 1560. It contains the work of many Scots poets who would otherwise be unknown.M. Lynch, \\"Culture: 3 Medieval\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), , pp. 117‚Äì8. In the late fifteenth century, Scots prose also began to develop as a genre. Although there are earlier fragments of original Scots prose, such as the Auchinleck Chronicle,Thomas Thomson ed., Auchinleck Chronicle (Edinburgh, 1819). the first complete surviving work is John Ireland's The Meroure of Wyssdome (1490).J. Martin, Kingship and Love in Scottish poetry, 1424‚Äì1540 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), , p. 111. There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s, including The Book of the Law of Armys and the Order of Knychthode, and the treatise Secreta Secretorum, an Arabic work believed to be Aristotle's advice to Alexander the Great. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Gavin Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados, which was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglic language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden in the same year.

It is ecclesiastically part of the Eparchy of ≈†abac. According to tradition, the monastery was built by King Stefan Dragutin.  Location  The monastery is located southeast of Loznica. It is situated in the forested area of the Korenita village. However, being also close to the village of Tr≈°iƒá and as the first school of a linguist and language reformer Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá who was also from Tr≈°iƒá, the monastery is popularly connected to this village.  History  = Old monastery = There are no proper historical records which confirm the origin of the monastery and everything known about it is according to the various traditional writings. The monastery was an endowment of King Stefan Dragutin, however, he died in 1316 and the construction was finished by his widow, Queen Catherine in 1317. It was named after three rivers which confluence into one at the monastery (tri reke koje vodu nose, \\"three water bearing rivers\\"). The original edifice was looted and razed by the Ottoman Empire several times in the 14th and 15th centuries. It ended up being completely demolished and it is not known what the original monastery looked like. = Reconstruction = It was rebuilt on the foundations of the old monastery in 1559. The enterprise was headed by the hegumen Pajsije and monks Arsenije and Genadije. That same year, the Church of the Presentation of Mary was built. Just few years later, a school which transcribed and rewrote the old manuscripts was operational. As an act of retaliation for the attacks of the hajduks in the region, the Ottomans burned it in the early 1800s. It was renovated in 1834 and was painted by Mihailo Konstantinoviƒá from Bitola and Nikola Jankoviƒá from Ohrid. In 1791, a hieromonk Josif Trono≈°ac transcribed the 1526 Trono≈°a Chronicle, the most important Serbian literary memorial in the first half of the 18th century. The copy of the chronicle is kept in the monastery, while the original is in Vienna. = World wars = Trono≈°a was badly damaged during the World War I. During the Battle of Cer in 1914, Serbian wounded soldiers were transported to the monastery for medical treatments. After Austria-Hungary occupied Serbia, their army burned the church books. The also destroyed or removed all doors in the complex, which were repaired only in 1923. In August 1941, a local Chetnik rebellion liberated Loznica (\\"the first town liberated from Germans in the occupied Europe\\") in the Battle of Loznica, and Trono≈°a's hegumen Georgije Bojiƒá was active in the planning and conducting of the operation. as an aide to Veselin Misita, in charge of the attack. When German reoccupied the area in October 1941 they burned the monastery books and punched through one of the walls with the cannonball. = Today = In the vicinity of the monastery is the Chapel of the Saint Holy Martyr Pantaleon. Below the chapel is the ten- pipe concrete drinking fountain with cold, spring water. Both the chapel and the fountain were also destroyed several times through history. Traditionally, the original fountain is attributed to the mythological Jug Bogdan (based on the historical Vratko Nemanjiƒá, though) and his nine sons, the Jugoviƒá brothers, hence the ten pipes. They built the chapel and the fountain in 1388 prior to the Battle of Kosovo. Modern chapel and the fountain were restored in 1968 when the fresco \\"Leaving to the Battle of Kosovo\\" was painted on the fountain. The fountain is called \\"The Fountain of the Nine Jugoviƒá\\". One of the best known traditions in the monastery is the making of large \\"plowmen candles\\". Two are cast each year out of of wax and are tall. On the Maundy Thursday people gather in front of the monastery, bring the candles inside the church and light them in front of the icons of Jesus Christ and the Holy Mother of God. They are thought to help to preserve and enhance the harvest, hence the name. The custom of casting the candles and the ceremony of bringing them into the church and lighting them has been placed on the Serbian list of the intangible cultural heritage. As Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá learned to write in the monastery, \\"coming to school from the nearby Tr≈°iƒá through the forest\\", a section of the monastery is adapted into the \\"Museum of the Vuk's early schooling\\". Today, Trono≈°a is a female monastery. In 2017 it officially celebrated 700th anniversary. The monastery has been protected since 22 December 1948 and was declared a cultural monument of great importance in 1979.Cultural monuments in Serbia - Monastery Trono≈°a  Architecture  The monastery was built in the Ra≈°ka architectural school. In terms of architectural and spatial traits, there is resemblance between the Uvac Monastery, Church of the Annunciation Monastery in Ovƒçar Banja, Pustinja Monastery, Dobrilovina Monastery, Majstorovina Monastery, Trono≈°a Monastery and others.  Saint Stefan of Trono≈°a  Archimandrite Stefan Jovanoviƒá was born in the nearby village of Tekeri≈°, on the Cer. He was a noted spiritual leader, patriot, rebel and the first teacher of Vuk Stefanoviƒá Karad≈æiƒá. He was especially active against the Turkification (\\"thanks to him, none of the Serbs east of the Drina river were Turkified\\"). When the famine struck the regions of Jadar and Raƒëevina, he came to the local Turks to ask for the help for the hungry people, but the Turks poisoned him. In 2017 Serbian Orthodox Church canonized him as the Venerable Stefan of Trono≈°a. Its day is 17 September and it is the official slava of the Eparchy of ≈†abac.

The part of the line that is still in operation today is largely single-track and non- electrified and is classified as a main line. History The Dutch Westphalian Railway Company received a concession on 26 June 1878 for the construction of a railway line that would connect the Ruhr area as directly as possible to the network of the Dutch railways in Winterswijk and Zutphen. It began the construction of the line in Winterswijk, which was already connected to a railway line to Zutphen. From there, the line runs nearly directly to Hervest via Borken. There the line met the Duisburg‚ÄìQuakenbr√ºck railway, which in the meantime had been opened by the Rhenish Railway Company in 1879, and followed it to Dorsten. The last section ran in a wide arc to the south-east and met the Royal Westphalian Emscher Valley Railway at Hugo junction. The line ended in Bismarck station, now Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck marshalling yard, of the Royal Westphalian Railway Company and the Bergisch-M√§rkische Railway Company, on the Bergisch-M√§rkische Emscher Valley Railway. The two companies were already operating in cooperation with each other. Passenger traffic on the line started on 21 June 1880 under the management of the Bergisch- M√§rkische Railway Company from the beginning. =Partial closure= Line between Winterswijk and Borken At the beginning of the First World War, cross- border traffic between Burlo and Winterswijk was stopped, but it was restored in the late 1920s. At the beginning of the Second World War, passenger services were finally abandoned, while the last freight train ran on 30 September 1979. The Dutch part of the track was declared a nature reserve, making its reopening difficult. Passenger services were abandoned between Borken and Burlo on 29 September 1961, while freight traffic continued until 30 September 1994. This section was formally closed on 1 January 1996. Current situation The main part of the line between Gelsenkirchen Zoo station (one kilometre east of the Gelsenkirchen-Bismarck marshalling yard) and Borken station is still open as a non-electrified and largely single-track line. The line is double track from Zweckel junction, near Gladbeck West station, where with a link from the line from Bottrop connects, to Dorsten station. From there to Hervest-Dorsten station the line runs parallel to the line to Coesfeld, creating the impression of a double-track line. On the section of the line that is still in operation there are now 37 crossings, eleven with full barriers, 18 with half barriers and three which just have a flashing light, which means that there is an average of just over one kilometre between each crossing. A special feature is the railway crossing in Gelsenkirchen-Beckhausen, where this line crosses a narrow-gauge railway operated by BOGESTRA at an at-grade crossing. Rail services The majority of the line is still served by public transport services: * Regionalbahn service RB 43 (Emschertal-Bahn) runs from Dortmund follows the line from Gelsenkirchen Zoo to Dorsten station. * Regionalbahn service RB 45 (Der Coesfelder) on its way between Dorsten to Coesfeld uses the parallel track between Dorsten station and Hervest-Dorsten. * Regional-Express service RE 14 (Der Borkener) from Essen via Bottrop runs for more than 30 km‚Äîmore than half of the original length of the line‚Äîbetween Zweckel junction and the end of the current line in Borken station. The RB 43 is operated by DB Regio and the RE 14 and RB 45 are operated by NordWestBahn.

Originating from a tropical depression on October 25, Cimaron developed within an environment strongly favoring tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines. On October 28, the system underwent rapid intensification, culminating in attaining its peak strength with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Estimates from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ranked the system as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute sustained winds of 260 km/h (160 mph), though this is argued to have underrepresented the typhoon's strength. The system moved ashore near Casiguran, Aurora in northern Luzon at peak strength. Crossing the island, Cimaron emerged over the South China Sea where conditions allowed for temporary reorganization. After becoming nearly stationary on November 1, the typhoon executed a tight anti- cyclonic loop and rapidly weakened. The storm degenerated into a tropical depression on November 4, before dissipating three days later off the coast of Vietnam. Prior to impacting the Philippines, Public Storm Warning Signals #3 and #4, the two highest levels, were raised for several provinces in Luzon. Thousands of residents were urged to evacuate while local authorities prepared services for quick recovery efforts. With Cimaron initially expected to strike Vietnam, officials planned to evacuate 218,000 people; however, Cimaron's slow motion and demise over open waters resulted in these plans being suspended. Officials in Thailand and southern China also advised residents of possible effects from the storm. In contrast to the typhoon's extreme intensity, damage was somewhat limited in the Philippines due to the lower population density of the affected areas. Widespread flooding and landslides caused substantial disruptions to travel and isolated some communities. Thirty-four people were killed in various incidents, mostly from flooding. Nearly 365,000 people were affected by the storm and losses amounted to 1.21 billion PHP (US$31 million). Winds along the periphery of Cimaron fanned a large wildfire near Hong Kong, and moisture from it fueled record-breaking rains in British Columbia, Canada. Relief efforts in the Philippines began soon after the storm's passage; however, two other storms struck the country in November, with one resulting in far greater damage. Following a request for international assistance in early December, more than US$10 million was provided in relief aid to the Philippines. Meteorological history On October 24, 2006, an area of disturbed weather, characterized by flaring convection around a low-level circulation, developed approximately 595 km (370 mi) east of Guam. Situated within a region favoring tropical cyclogenesis, the system consolidated as it tracked generally westward. Late on October 25, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the low as a tropical depression. With poleward outflow improving, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert the following day before initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 22W. Several hours later, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration assigned the storm the local name Paeng as was within their area of responsibility. Situated south of a strong subtropical ridge, the system maintained a general west-northwest track. On October 27, the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was assigned the name Cimaron by the JMA. The small storm subsequently underwent a period of rapid intensification as dual outflow channels developed; the storm reached typhoon status early on October 28\\\\. At the end of this phase on October 29, Cimaron attained its peak intensity with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a barometric pressure of 920 mbar (hPa; 27.17 inHg). The JTWC estimated Cimaron to have been a stronger system, attaining its peak intensity as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon with one-minute winds of 260 km/h (160 mph). However, satellite estimates from forecasters within the agency itself, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Satellite Analysis Branch (SAB), the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA), and Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy-Pontoise University stated Cimaron to have been an even stronger system. Using the Dvorak technique - a method of determining a tropical cyclone's intensity based on satellite appearance - AFWA and SAB yielded a peak value of T7.5, 285 km/h (180 mph), while advanced operational values from the JTWC peaked at T7.8, 305 km/h (190 mph). Additionally, a forecaster at SAB noted that the lower estimates were likely due to restrictions on the Dvorak technique stemming from Cimaron's rapid intensification. The forecaster also noted that a second type of estimate gave a maximum value of T8.0, 315 km/h (195 mph), the highest rating on the scale. While at its peak strength, Cimaron displayed two small concentric eyewalls, separated by a few kilometres. The storm later made landfall near Casiguran, Aurora in northern Luzon shortly after 1200 UTC on October 29; it became one of the strongest storms to ever hit the region. Interaction with the island's mountainous terrain caused substantial weakening, though Cimaron maintained typhoon status during its 12‚Äëhour crossing. After emerging over the South China Sea on October 30, the system initially maintained its west-northwest course. However, the following day, a weakness developed within the ridge previously steering the typhoon, and Cimaron briefly turned north before essentially stalling. During this time, the system reorganized somewhat and reached a secondary peak intensity with winds of 165 km/h (105 mph) on November 2. While executing a tight clockwise loop, increased wind shear and entrainment of dry air soon caused Cimaron to dramatically weaken. With a new ridge becoming established over China, the weakening system acquired a general southwestward track. Cimaron weakened to a tropical depression on November 4 and ultimately dissipated three days later, just off the coast of southeastern Vietnam. Preparations Typhoon Cimaron rapidly intensifying off the Luzon coast on October 28 By October 28, Isabela, southern Cagayan, Quirino, and northern Aurora provinces were placed under Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) #3, the second-highest level. More than 20 provinces overall were placed under varying PSWS levels. Residents living along the coast were urged to evacuate. Early on October 29, several provinces along Luzon's east coast were placed under PSWS #4, the highest level of alert. During a national radio broadcast President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo urged residents to heed warnings and not to venture out during the storm. Throughout Luzon, schools and government offices were closed on October 29 while residents in mountainous areas were urged to evacuate due to threat of mudslides. The National Transmission Corporation deployed power restoration crews across the region to allow for quick post- storm response. Hospitals in Cimaron's projected path requested employees to be present in anticipation of an influx of patients. Quick response teams from the Department of Social Welfare and Development were placed on standby for possible deployment. Within evacuation areas, the Philippine National Police was dispatched to prevent people from returning to these areas. Bus companies suspended all services north of Tarlac City and San Jose. As Cimaron emerged over the South China Sea, officials in Vietnam began preparing for possible effects from the storm. Authorities began evacuating residents in flood-prone areas along the coast from Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh Kh√°nh H√≤a, including 12,500 in Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø Province. Fishermen were urged to seek shelter at nearby ports until the storm subsided. The Vietnamese Government also requested the deployment of the nation's Army, Coast Guard, and Navy to assist in evacuation efforts. Residents still recovering from Typhoon Xangsane in early October were forced to secure their homes and evacuate once again. An estimated 218,000 people were planned to be relocated across Vietnam: 68,000 in Qu·∫£ng Nam, 60,000 in Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã, 50,000 in Th·ª´a Thi√™n‚ÄìHu·∫ø, and 40,000 in Qu·∫£ng B√¨nh. Appeals were made to roughly 3,500 vessels, with a collective crew count of 32,285, to return to port. The Navy deployed 42 ships for possible search and rescue missions. Following Cimaron's change in course and cessation of movement, the Vietnamese Government suspended all evacuation plans on November 2; however, fishermen were urged to remain at port in fears of repeating the incidents during Typhoon Chanchu in May of that year where over 200 fishermen lost their lives. Officials in Thailand also monitored the storm as a potential flood threat. Many reservoirs in the nation were above 80 percent capacity and further heavy rains would lead to a major flood event; the main concerns were for the Bhumibol and Sirikit dams in Tak and Uttaradit provinces, respectively. Authorities in Hainan province, China, warned of possible effects from the storm as well beginning on October 31\\\\. Heavy squalls, with winds of were forecast for eastern areas of the island and areas offshore. By November 1, approximately 20,000 fishing vessels returned to port as conditions over the South China Sea deteriorated; shipping over the Qiongzhou Strait remained unaffected. Impact =Philippines= Infrared satellite loop of Typhoon Cimaron making landfall in Luzon on October 29 Typhoon Cimaron struck the Philippines with winds estimated at 195 km/h (120 mph) and gusts in excess of 230 km/h (145 mph). Along coastal Aurora Province, a mother and daughter were killed when strong winds destroyed their home. Numerous trees and power lines were felled by the winds as well, causing widespread blackouts in Luzon. The majority of Aurora and Isabela provinces were left without power and telecommunications for more than two weeks. Approximately 90 percent of the homes in Dinapigue were damaged. Heavy rains across the region swelled many rivers, flooding low-lying areas along their banks. Several bridges became impassable and officials had to release water from two major dams to prevent them from overflowing. The most significant flooding occurred along the Allied-Sinocalan and Tagamusing rivers in Pangasinan. Low-lying areas along the Cagayan, Chico, Magat, Pinacanauan, Tuguegarao Pared rivers throughout Cagayan province were also affected by flooding. Numerous roads were blocked off by landslides or washed away by flooding, severely limiting travel. A landslide temporarily isolated four barangays in Nueva Vizcaya. A Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council search and rescue team was later deployed to Kasibu where at least four people were killed by flooding. Fatal landslides took place in Benguet and Kalinga provinces. A traffic accident blamed on the storm in La Union resulted in one death and seven injuries. Throughout the Philippines, damage amounted to roughly 1.21 billion PHP (US$31 million), of which 664 million PHP (US$17 million) was attributed to agriculture. Approximately eight percent of the corn and rice harvest was destroyed. A total of 2,605 homes were destroyed while another 18,181 were damaged. Across seven provinces, 364,733 people were affected by the typhoon, 65,585 of whom were significantly impacted. A total of 34 people lost their lives as a result of Cimaron. Additionally, 65 people sustained injuries. =Elsewhere= Typhoon Cimaron over the South China Sea on October 31 Though the storm remained over open waters after moving over the South China Sea, strong winds stemming from it fanned a large wildfire in Tai Lam Country Park, Hong Kong. At least 136 fires ignited on October 30 during the Chung Yeung Festival. The Tai Lam fire grew to be the largest in over a decade, ultimately charring 450 hectares (1,112 acres) and 66,000 trees. The storm's winds coupled with seasonally low humidity made conditions difficult for firefighters trying to suppress the fire. Over the South China Sea, the long Chinese cargo ship, Tongda 998, became stranded amid swells and winds after its engine failed. All 18 crewmen were unharmed after the vessel was towed to port in Zhuhai by the rescue ship Dejin. Moisture from the typhoon also fed an extratropical cyclone, in an atmospheric river known as the Pineapple Express, that brought heavy rains to southern British Columbia, Canada, prompting flood watches for the region Southern areas of the province were deluged by the storm, with some areas receiving of rain. The daily rainfall record for November 6 of at Victoria International Airport was shattered with falling. Widespread flooding occurred as rivers over-topped their banks; hundreds of homes were inundated, prompting numerous evacuations. The Vedder River reached a 25-year high and forced the evacuation 200 residences. Aftermath Damage assessments in the Philippines began on October 31, with aerial surveys being utilized for isolated areas. With numerous roads blocked off or washed away, clearing operations were a priority. The Philippine Red Cross assisted in the immediate aftermath of Typhoon Cimaron, evacuating people in La Union and providing relief goods to more than 16,000 people in Aurora. The majority of relief work was handled by local governments, though some assistance from the National Disaster Coordinating Council was received. By November 1, the estimated cost of humanitarian assistance reached 3.2 million PHP (US$81,000). Teams from the Red Cross were already deployed in the Philippines due to Typhoon Xangsane in September and were able to quickly respond in Cimaron's aftermath. Relief efforts for Cimaron were cut short as just two weeks later, Typhoon Chebi struck nearly the same areas. A weaker, though still powerful typhoon, damage from Chebi was relatively limited. In late November, Typhoon Durian brought even greater devastation to the Philippines and prompted greater need for international assistance. On December 11, President Arroyo declared a national state of calamity and released 1 billion PHP (US$25.6 million) in relief and rehabilitation funds. Throughout 2006 as a whole, the Philippines was devastated by multiple natural disasters that collectively killed well over 1,000 people and left more than US$1.6 billion in damage. Consequently, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for emergency assistance to the nation, in the form of US$46 million in funds for the most severely affected areas. The European Commission Humanitarian Aid department also provided ‚Ç¨2 million (US$1.9 million) in emergency funds in relation to the four major typhoons that struck the country, with a focus on areas affected by Typhoon Durian. The Red Cross ultimately provided US$9.67 million in assistance to the nation in relation to the four typhoons as well as Typhoon Fengshen in June 2008 which struck while relief efforts from the 2006 storms were still ongoing.

It was succeeded by The Daily Herald, which ran from 7 March 1910 to 16 June 1924. History The 1890s was a period of intense industrial unrest in Australia: squatters and shippers, manufacturers, merchants and miners had all been doing very nicely in the 1880s with exports booming, but little seemed to the shearers, labourers and sailors to be \\"trickling down\\" to them. Then around 1885 demand slackened off and with falling prices, the employers felt the need to reduce their labour force, and cut the wages of those who remained. The Maritime Labour Council (MLC) was formed in Adelaide in 1886 and the following year raised a Maritime Strike Fund of ‚Ç§9,600, of which various workers' unions subscribed around half. When the United Trades and Labour Council of South Australia needed money to start a workers' newspaper, the Port Adelaide Seamen's Union was quick to assist with an interest-free loan.Jim Moss, Sound of Trumpets Wakefield Press, Adelaide 1985 p.163 =The Weekly Herald= A predecessor of The Herald was Our Commonwealth for which A. W. Rayment and Ignatius Singer wrote articles on Single Tax. Another, though later derided, was The Voice edited by John Medway Day (1838‚Äì1905) in 1892 for the Single Tax League. Labor Party organisers D. Williams, John Abel McPherson, Henry and his brother George H. Buttery, and others, founded the Cooperative Printing and Publishing Company of S.A. Limited, with 30,000 shares of 10s., Ten shillings, which converted to $1 in 1966, would equate to around $50 in today's values. and merged with the company publishing The Voice. The Weekly Herald was founded in October 1894, edited by Geoff Burgoyne, later leader writer for Sir Winthrop Hackett's West Australian. George Wedd was editor from April 1895. He was later associated with the Sporting Life weekly. He was also secretary of the SA Athletics League, the Band Association of SA and Goodwood United Rifle Club. =The Herald= From the first issue in 1899 the publication was named The Herald, with uninterrupted numbering, and no other substantial change. Shortly after foundation, the paper's banner was subtitled \\"Labor and Democratic Organ of South Australia\\"; in 1896 \\"The Official Organ of the Labor and Democratic Parties of South Australia\\" and from 1897 \\"The Official Organ of the Trades and Labor Council, United Labor Party, and Democratic Societies of S.A.\\". =The Daily Herald= The Daily Herald was from 7 March 1910 published by the Cooperative Printing and Publishing Company of S.A. Limited, with offices at 117 Grenfell Street for the Labor Party. William Wedd (9 January 1845 ‚Äì 10 February 1922) was the first editor, with Geoffrey Burgoyne as associate editor. The first few weeks' issues were printed by The Register, as its own presses had teething problems. Wedd was forced by ill-health to retire after a year or two, but continued to contribute, as \\"Epsilon\\" and \\"Remus\\", to the Herald and other newspapers. Burgoyne, a son of T. Burgoyne M.P., was later with The West Australian, then in 1924 the founding editor of the Hobart News, daughter publication of the Adelaide News. In 1940, he was managing editor of the Perth News. Editor from 1911 to 1912 and 1916 to 1924 was Harry Kneebone, Editor from 1912 to 1914 was Cam Pratt, a member of a family of journalists, who was next with the West Australian, followed by the Sydney Morning Herald, publicity department of Ford Australia then with Cinesound Productions and editor of the film journal. The editor from 1914 to 1916 was Labor politician E. H. Coombe. Julian Woods, previously with the Melbourne Telegraph and The Age, and the Perth Daily News, was a sub-editor 1913. Harry Kneebone returned to the editor's chair in 1916, with the paper in decline. In 1910 the paper had 12 pages and cover price was 1d.; by 1924 it had 4 pages for 1¬Ωd and although the Advertiser was the same price it boasted 16 pages. The perceived poorer value resulted in a decreased circulation and reduced advertising revenue, and the paper's financial position, already shaky, became dire. A meeting of shareholders 23 June 1924 decided on immediate voluntary liquidation. =\\"Laradale\\" and Seth Ferry= Between 9 March 1918 and 1 February 1919 The Herald ran a weekly feature, instalments 1‚Äì35 bylined \\"Laradale\\" (William W. Goddard), based on interviews with, and unpublished memoirs of, Seth \\"The Master\\" Ferry, a major figure of the Adelaide turf scene for some 50 years. Chapters from #36 were not attributed, and may have been written by Ferry himself, and the series ended peremptorily at #46 with no explanation. Goddard successfully sued the Co-operative Printing and Publishing Company, publishers of The Daily Herald for withholding part of his wages. Goddard's accounts of details of his contract were refuted by The Herald. Printing =The Weekly Herald= Though some preliminary arrangements may have been made with C. W. Chandler, printing was first contracted out to Webb & Son of 28 Grenfell Street. In January 1896 the contract was changed to Scrymgour & Sons of King William Street. A fortnight later Ralph William Webb and Henry Arthur Webb petitioned for the winding up of the Co-operative Printing and Publishing Company, producers of The Herald, on the grounds of unpaid debts. From June 1896, Trades Hall had its own printing facilities. =The Daily Herald= Having decided to publish daily, it was necessary to upgrade the printing machinery. A rotary press would have been ideal, but the lead time for manufacture and shipping to Adelaide was too great, so they settled on a secondhand \\"Victory\\" web printing press, ex- Melbourne. A \\"state of the art\\" stereotyping plant and five Mergenthaler linotype compositing machines (four Model No. 1 duplex single-letter machines and one Model No. 4 machine) were sent out from the Broadheath, Greater Manchester factory, and were received eight weeks from placing the order. =Other work= From November 1913 printing of The Southern Cross went from Scrymgour & Son to the Co-operative Printing and Publishing Company.
