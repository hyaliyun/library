Biography Tunbridge was born in Dover, Kent, to bricklayer John Nicholas Tunbridge and Anne, n√©e Denne. Educated at Eythorne, he migrated to Australia in 1884 and established himself as an architect in Townsville, where he would eventually establish the civil engineering, architecture and surveying firm Tunbridge & Tunbridge. In February 1889 he was commissioned in the Mounted Infantry of the Queensland Land Forces, and in December was promoted lieutenant. He and his unit were sent to keep order at the 1891 shearers' strike, and in June 1892 Tunbridge was promoted captain. In November 1898 he was promoted major and transferred to the Queensland Artillery Garrison Battery, serving in South Africa from 1900 and commanding the 3rd Mounted Infantry Contingent. He saw action at Elands River and Rhenoster Kop. He served with distinction and was mentioned in despatches, appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath, awarded the Queen's South Africa Medal with five clasps and promoted brevet lieutenant- colonel. He returned to Australia in 1902 and served as aide-de-camp to the Governor-General. On 7 April 1904 Tunbridge married Leila Emily Brown in Brisbane, and later extended his firm to include a Melbourne branch, where he based himself until 1914. Appointed censor for the 3rd Military District in August 1914, he was swiftly promoted to deputy chief censor and before the month was out returned to the military as a lieutenant-colonel in the Australian Imperial Force. Given command of the 1st Australian Division Ammunition Park (Mechanical Transport), Tunbridge and his units arrived in England in February 1915, where they were incorporated into the British Army as the 300th and 301st Mechanical Transport Companies and sent to France in July. Influential in various reorganisations of the mechanical transport units, Tunbridge was appointed to command the 1 Anzac Corps Ammunition Park on 25 April 1916 and following a reorganisation in January 1917 became senior mechanical operator of the 1 Anzac Corps. During the Third Battle of Ypres his responsibilities covered the entire AIF contingent in France. In June 1918 Tunbridge was promoted colonel; he retired in January 1920 and was formally retired from the AIF in June. He had been mentioned in despatches five times during the war and was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1917, Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1919 and brevet colonel of the Australian Military Forces. He returned to architecture until his retirement in the 1930s. Tunbridge died at Hawthorn in 1943 and was survived by his wife and three children.

The road continues eastward across northern Tate County and ends at MS 305 near Independence. MS 306 was designated in 1952, and it was constructed in 1953 from US 51 to MS 305. The route was paved in asphalt by 1956, and an interchange was built at I-55 by 1967. Route description All of the route is located inside northern Tate County. MS 306 is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and all of it is maintained by the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT), as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. MS 306 starts at the intersection of US 51, MS 304 Scenic, and Ilene Saunders Street in Coldwater.

One project was MS 306, which included grading, drainage and culverts, and gravel surfacing. By 1953, the gravel road opened, connecting from US 51 to MS 305. Another project was announced in 1954, with asphalt surfacing and more drainage and culverts. By 1956, all of the route was paved, and MS 305 was extended past MS 306. In 1960, I-55 was proposed to intersect MS 306, and construction began by 1962. In 1967, an interchange was built at I-55, and no significant changes have been made to the route since.

The youngest of the direct monastic disciples, he was affectionately known by his brother monks, whose leader was Swami Vivekananda, as \\"Khoka\\" (Bengali for little boy). He played a pioneering role in establishing the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission. He was one of the first group of trustees of the Belur Math appointed by Vivekananda in 1901, and was afterwards elected treasurer of the Ramakrishna MissionRamakrishna Mission Institute of Culture, Swami Subodhananda Biography =Early years= Subodh Chandra Ghosh was born in Calcutta on 8 November 1867 to the family of Shankar Ghosh, who was also the founder of a famous landmark in Calcutta, the Kali temple in Thanthania in the north. He was thus born in a well to do family in a religious environment conducive to the enquiry beyond material realm.The disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, published by Advaita Ashrama, Mayawati, 1943. As per the prevailing customs he was supposed to get married after passing his class examinations. However, apparently because of a disinclination to marry, he failed in the examination.Budhhistlibrary.com Swami Subodhananda Subodh was at first a student of the Hare School and was then admitted into the school founded by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, a notable social reformer and educationist of Bengal in the 19th century. While studying there he came across a Bengali book called The Teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, by Suresh Chandra Datta. He was impressed and decided to meet Ramakrishna who resided in Dakshineswar temple. He was received very cordially by the saint who asked him to visit him on Tuesdays and Saturdays. Subodh came to him despite obstacles raised by his parents. As part of his practices there under the tutelage of Ramakrishna, he was helped into deep meditation by the latter, which benefited him in his spiritual pursuits.RKM Chennai, Swami Subodhananda Subodhananda, when asked by Ramakrishna what he thought of him, replied that, \\"Many persons say many things about you, I would not believe them unless I myself find proof.\\" Ramakrishna advised him to visit Mahendranath Gupta, also known as \\"M\\", who later became famous as the author of Ramakrishna Kathamrita, the original Bengali version of The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. =Life of a monk= After the death of Ramakrishna in 1886, Subodh left his home and joined the monastery in Baranagar, started by Narendranath Dutta, who later became known as Vivekananda. Subodh's monastic name was Swami Subodhananda, but he was more popularly called \\"Khoka\\" or the child, being the youngest among the brother disciples. Towards the end of 1889, along with Brahmananda, Subodhananda went to Benaras where he practised austerities. In 1890 they together went for a pilgrimage to the Western and Central India including Omkar, Girnar, Bombay, Dwarka and to Vrindaban where they stayed for sometime. He also went to the Himalayas for spiritual quest, went as far as Kedarnath and Badrinath. He also travelled to South India as far as Cape Comorin or Kanya Kumari. After Vivekananda returned from the West, he exhorted the brother disciples to work for the welfare of the humanity, Subodhananda pledged his service and was put under various capacities for the cause of the newly founded Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. He was initially placed in charge of the management of the monastery in 1899. When the great plague broke out in Calcutta, Subodhananda worked hard for arranging relief and rehabilitation along with Sadananda and Sister Nivedita. During the famine of 1908 in the Chilka islands of Orissa he worked alongside fellow monks of the Ramakrishna Mission to provide relief to the affected people. In his later years, even though he was not able to get engaged in active work, he would inspire people to work for the cause of welfare. During the last years he made extensive tours of Bengal and Bihar to spread the message of Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. He initiated a large number of people including children. In making disciples he made no distinction in terms of social position, caste, sex or age. Subodhananda was one of the first group of trustees of the Belur Math appointed by Vivekananda, and was later appointed as the treasurer. =Character and legacy= One of the hallmarks of Subodhananda's character was frankness. When Ramakrishna had asked him to interact with \\"M\\", he responded that the latter being a householder would not be able to teach him about God. When young Subodh went to meet \\"M\\" he narrated this conversation verbatim to \\"M\\" who appreciated his openness. He also would be found near sick beds nursing people, often at risk to his own health. One of such instances was his nursing of a young student who was suffering from a contagious and malignant type of smallpox. He would beg money from others to help poor patients with diet and medicine. He helped many poor families with the money donated by devotees for his personal needs. He was self-reliant and did not accept personal service from others, even during his illness. He had very few things as personal belongings. In personal conduct as well as in conversation he put much emphasis on self-surrender to God as the means of salvation. One of his famous lectures was in Madras in 1897 to an audience belonging to the Young Men's Hindu Association, where he talked on Sannyasa (renunciation) and Brahmacharya (celibacy).Swami Subodhananda's lecture in Madras =Relationship with monks and brother disciples= Subodhananda was an ardent follower of Vivekananda and the latter loved him as well. He was childlike in his simplicity and unassuming in his behaviour. For this reason was loved and respected by his brother disciples. On an occasion in 1897 he was persuaded by Vivekananda to deliver a lecture in the Alambazar monastery, despite his inhibitions with public speaking. When he rose to speak tremors were felt on account of an earthquake. Vivekananda then quipped that \\"Khoka's was an earth-shattering speech\\" and everybody enjoyed at his expense. Subodhananda was addicted lifelong to his morning cup of tea and when Ramakrishna was ill in his Cossipore garden house, the young Subodh prescribed tea as a remedy for his sore throat. However it was rejected by the attending doctor. The young ascetics and monks of the Ramakrishna Math found him to be a source of great help as he would enquire about their troubles and difficulties, would be their mouthpiece to the seniors, would mediate for them and shield them when they inadvertently committed something wrong. He would also guide and mentor them in performing their day to activities and in other spiritual matters.

The protest took place in 14 August 2011. Background On 8 August, typhoon Muifa struck Dalian city, breaching one of the factory's protective dykes. The breach highlighted the risk of a future storm or natural event causing a breach in the factory's storage tanks, flooding the town with the highly toxic chemical. The factory, a joint venture between the city and the private company Fujia began operating in 2007. In early August, prior to the typhoon, a film crew from China Central Television (CCTV), filming a story on the factory, were denied entry to the factory and then beaten by factory workers. A trailer advertising the story was broadcast on CCTV, but the segment was withdrawn by the station, triggering speculation on blogs and Twitter that the factory was being protected from scrutiny by someone in authority. 14 August 2011  Residents of Dalian organised a \\"stroll\\" (used as a euphemism for \\"protest\\" in China to avoid censorship) in People's Square through Weibo, Twitter, blogs and Internet forums to spread the message. On 14 August, tens of thousands of people gathered in the Square to protest, demanding the factory be immediately shut down and relocated, and that investigation into the factory be made public. The news agency Reuters reported that Chinese authorities had blocked searches for the terms \\"PX\\", \\"Dalian\\" and \\"Dalian protests\\" on Weibo microblogs. Compromise On the afternoon of 14 August, the Dalian city government agreed to move the factory out of city, although the new location of the factory and the date of its move were not announced. The proposed new location was later announced to be an industrial park on Xizhong Island. In early December 2011, a leaked document posted online suggested that the plant had passed safety checks and would soon resume production. Shortly afterwards, local residents reported that smoke was billowing from the plant's chimney and workers were arriving at the plant. City officials refused to confirm that the plant was active, and said that the planned move to Xizhong Island would proceed but would take some time.

It is the result of the reunification of the Federalist Party of France and the Europe United Party which had a presence in several countries of the European Union. It is one of the first European-oriented political parties that openly defends European federalism and is not a coalition of pre-existing national parties. In 2016, the office was composed of President Pietro De Matteis, Vice President Geogios Kostakos, Secretary General Emmanuel Rodary, Treasurer Mariarosaria Marziali, John Retetagos, Marco Marazzi and Michel Caillouet. Following the general assembly of December 6, 2016, the office of the European Federalist Party merges with the citizen movements Stand-up for the United States of Europe and USE Now to create Stand Up For Europe. The European Federalist Party is made up of members from 12 European countries, from civil society, who face their professional life and political commitment.  Political strategy The European Federalist Party, like the federalist model, leaves a great deal of autonomy to its national sections, which have a certain freedom of adaptation of the European program to the local culture. On the other hand, the European program whose primary goal is to build a European federation is common. The PFE thus seeks to differentiate itself from the current official formations of the European Parliament by proposing a real cohesion on the European level. The announced goal is to create a mass popular movement around the party and the idea of a federal Europe to respond to the current crisis. The European Federalist Party has participated in numerous elections, including the French presidential election and the European elections.  Political project  The goal of the European Federalist Party is to create a European Federation of voluntary member states of the European Union. It aims to present candidates at all elections across Europe. He was initially supported by prominent European personalities, such as Marco Pannella (former MEP, deputy, Italian senator and Altiero Spinelli collaborator), who was a member. The members of the PFE campaign for the creation of a supranational European State with limited sovereign powers and political institutions: government, assembly, federal Senate representing the Member States. = Main proposals = As the name suggests, the party's goal is to make the European Union a true federal state. This project can be carried out possibly from a nucleus of volunteer countries members of the eurozone.

It is played on an uncheckered 12√ó12 gameboard with one king and eight rooks per side, where rooks are able to promote to queens. The inventor's aim was \\"to create a game of tactical and strategical depth that was both simple and elegant to express the concept of mate‚Äîthe 'pure' chess game\\". The game was played for many years at the Fanaat games club in the Netherlands and was featured in the periodical The Gamer 6 in May‚ÄìJune 1982. Game rules Each player owns a castle consisting of 3√ó3 squares surrounded by a wall of 12 squares. A king may not leave its 3√ó3 castle, but the rooks are free to move unimpeded by castles or walls. * The king can move and capture like a chess king or a chess knight. It can only capture pieces inside the 3x3 castle, and cannot capture pieces on the wall. * A rook moves like a rook in chess, and is unimpeded by castles or walls. If its move ends on a square in the enemy castle, automatically promotes to a queen. * A queen moves like a queen in chess, and is unimpeded by castles or walls. * Captures are limited. A capture can happen between rooks and queens only when one player's rook or queen is on the enemy's wall and the other player's rook or queen is in its own castle. Then either player having the turn to move may capture. **In other situations rooks and queens cannot capture, and simply block one another's movement. For example, a queen inside an enemy castle is capturable only by the king. * Check occurs to a king whenever the king is in the path of an enemy rook or queen. Castle walls do not block checks. As in chess, White moves first, a capturing piece replaces the piece captured, and checkmate wins the game.

In a career that lasted from October 1958 to July 1960 he ran twelve times, winning six races, four of which are now Group races. His most notable success came in the 1959 Epsom Derby. He went on to have a successful stud career in Great Britain and Japan. Background Parthia was a bay horse bred in England by his owner Sir Humphrey de Trafford. He was trained throughout his career by the veteran Captain (later Sir) Cecil Boyd-Rochfort at his Freemason Lodge Stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Parthia‚Äôs sire Persian Gulf won the Coronation Cup in 1944 and went on to be a successful sire. Apart from Parthia, his most notable offspring was the 1000 Guineas winner Zabara. His dam, Lightning won one race and was a half sister of Alcide. Alcide, who ran for the same owner and trainer as Parthia, had been the ante-post favourite for the 1958 Derby but was withdrawn from the race after being ‚Äúgot at‚Äù (deliberately injured) in his stable. Racing career =1958: two-year-old season= Parthia was slow to mature and did not appear on the racecourse until the October of his two-year- old season. He finished sixth on his debut in a race at Hurst Park, but then showed considerable improvement to run third in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. =1959: three-year-old season= At three, Parthia was targeted at the Derby from early in the season and was entered in recognised trial races for the Epsom Classic. He began by winning the White Rose Stakes at Hurst Park in April and was then sent to Chester where he won the Dee Stakes in May. His preparation for the Derby was completed by a victory in the Lingfield Derby Trial. Although he had won his first three starts he had not been particularly impressive, running in a \\"lazy\\" fashion and doing just enough to win in each case. In the Derby he started at odds of 10/1 in a field of twenty on an unusually hot day in front of a crowd which included the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Ridden by Harry Carr he was always prominent and challenged the leader Fidalgo (ridden by Carr's son-in-law Joe Mercer) in the straight. He pulled ahead in the final furlong to win by one and a half lengths from Fidalgo, with the French-trained favourite Shantung third. Shantung was considered an unlucky loser: he had been virtually pulled-up by his jockey who feared he was injured, and finished strongly after being tailed-off in last place entering the straight. Parthia suffered from a respiratory infection and began coughing after the Derby. He was off the racecourse for three months before returning in the St Leger. He started 8/13 favourite, but finished fourth behind the filly Cantelo sustaining an injury which ended his season. =1960: four-year-old season= Parthia returned with two wins in the spring of 1960. He won the Jockey Club Cup (then run over one and a half miles) at Newmarket and the Paradise Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Hurst Park. At Epsom he finished second to the outstanding filly Petite Etoile in the Coronation Cup and was then sent to Royal Ascot for the Hardwicke Stakes. He was expected to win but finished second, failing to concede six pounds to Aggressor after being forced to make much of the running. On his final start he ran unplaced behind Aggressor and Petite Etoile in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. Assessment Timeform awarded Parthia a rating of 132 in 1959. A rating of 130 is considered the mark of an above average European Group One winner In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Parthia an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù Derby winner. Stud career Parthia stood as a stallion in England until he was exported to Japan in 1968. The most notable of his European offspring was the filly Sleeping Partner who won The Oaks in 1969. In Japan he sired Fujino Parthia, winner of the Tenno Sho in autumn 1975 and the Takarazuka Kinen in 1976. Parthia died in Japan in 1982.

Background Since the 1944 signing of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, international aviation was based on bilateral air transport agreements, in which government would negotiate the rights of one or more flag carriers to operate routes between the countries. The negotiations focused on retaining each country's flag carrier's market share and also effectively hindered any airline from not being domestically owned‚Äîeither by the government or by private investors.Havel (2009): 9 In 1992, the United States started negotiating open skies agreements with the European Union (EU), which would allow any European airline to fly from any airport in their home country to any airport in the US, and similarly any US airline to fly from any US airport to any European airport.Havel (2009): 13 In the 1980s, SAS, Swissair, Austrian Airlines, and Finnair had attempted to establish European Quality Alliance (EQA).Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 34 In addition to codesharing and joint marketing,Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 52 the alliance was largely based around technical issues and using the EQA brand as a \\"seal of quality\\".Kleymann and Serist√∂: 26 These had largely stranded because Finnair felt that SAS goal was to use Finnair as a feeder airline to SAS' hub at Copenhagen Airport. There had also been previous discussions between SAS and Swissair, and SAS and KLM for mergers, without success.Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 49 In 1992, Swissair and Austrian Airlines had established the common frequent flyer program Qualiflyer. In 1988, SAS had bought 18.4 percent of Texas Air Corporation, the holding company which owned Continental Airlines. The two airlines had started a strategic cooperation, such as SAS moving its New York City services from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport. KLM was cooperating with British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, and Sabena. In addition, they had a strong tie with Northwest Airlines. In 1989, KLM bought 20 percent of the then ailing Northwest. In 1992, KLM had made a bailout purchase of Northwest, securing a 25 percent ownership of the airline, which is the maximum a foreign airline is allowed to own in a US airline. Swissair cooperated with Delta Air Lines and Singapore Airlines in a triangular cooperation, which was highly valued by the company's management. Delta was significantly larger than the other two US partner airlines, and had a base in New York City, rather than Northwest's hubs in Detroit and Minneapolis. Austrian Airlines lacked a US partner.Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 55 In Europe, the European Commission was working on plans to deregulate the aviation market, similar to the US Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. The Commission received support from the Netherlands and United Kingdom, while most other countries and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) were opposed to deregulation. In 1991, the Gulf War broke out. The price of petroleum escalated, while the demand for business travel diminished.Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 37 After a 1992 Swiss referendum rejected Swiss membership in the European Economic Area, Swissair was concerned they would not be able to have access to the European market. With its small home market, it was dependent on international partners to feed its hub. Proceedings and issues Jan Carlzon, the then-CEO of SAS, took the initiative for the merger process. He believed that a deregulated European airline market would result in five large airline conglomerates, and launched the strategy \\"one of five in 95\\" whereby the SAS Group would be one of five large players in the European market by 1995. At the time, SAS was the fourth-largest airline in Europe, behind Lufthansa, British Airways, and Air France. Carlzon envisaged that the smaller flag carriers should merge to create a large company. The plan was to allow the smaller airlines increased economy of scale, particularly on intercontinental flights.Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 35 For instance, Lufthansa had 20 percent lower unit costs than SAS on international routes.Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 50 SAS proposed that the new airline be organized as a consortium, in the same way SAS had been organized since 1946. This involved six national companies each owning a share of the new airline. However, SAS' then structure violated EU regulations, and would therefore have to gain permission from the supranational organization, which was largely controlled by the owners of SAS' main competitors.Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 54 The airlines agreed to attempt as many point-to-point transit flights as possible, although they would still have to operate some flights via a hub-and-spoke network. Specifically, SAS would degrade Stockholm-Arlanda Airport and Oslo Airport, Fornebu from hub status, and instead focus its traffic in Copenhagen, which would become the main hub for flights to China and Japan. Swissair's hub at Z√ºrich Airport would become the main hub for flights to Africa and South-East Asia and KLM's hub at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport would become the main hub for flights to South America, while Austrian's hub at Vienna International Airport would become the main hub for flights to Eastern Europe. The airlines operated three different long-haul aircraft: SAS used Boeing 767s, Swissair McDonnell Douglas MD-11s, while KLM operated Boeing 747 aircraft. Other non-conformities between the airlines included SAS using Amadeus and KLM using Galileo as their computer reservations system. To resolve issues with the labour unions, the airlines decided to organize the company with each of the airlines retaining their own aircraft and hiring their own flight crew and technical crew, with the merged company being a virtual airline. The last issues discussed during the merger talks was the location of the head office, the main hub, choice of US partner, the CEO and chair positions, and the ownership. The negotiations took a pause in July and August, and resumed in September.Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 56 By then the project was meeting opposition from SAS' Danish labour unions, who were concerned about the new airline's position in Copenhagen, as KLM's main hub in Amsterdam was considered too close to Copenhagen.Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 57 Swissair had a 70 percent higher labour cost level than KLM. The airlines agreed to an ownership structure of 30 percent for SAS, KLM, and Swissair, and 10 percent for Austrian. Swissair had higher profits and more share capital than the other airlines, and was nearly debt-free and owned almost all their aircraft. Because of this, the airline was to receive compensation from the other airlines. SAS agreed to sell its share in and terminate its cooperation with Continental Airlines. However, neither Swissair nor KLM were willing to abandon their American partners. However, SAS demanded that the head office be located in Copenhagen. After negotiations, KLM agreed to terminate their cooperation with Northwest, and Jan Carlzon was proposed as CEO. With the business operations division being headquartered in Vienna, KLM demanded and got acceptance for the head office to be located in Amsterdam. The new company was to be named Symphony.Bj√∂rnelid (2011): 58 On 21 November 1993, KLM announced that they would not participate in the merger, stranding the deal. The airline had not succeeded at gaining support amongst key stakeholders, such as Dutch banks, aircraft manufacturers, and labour unions at Northwest. Aftermath Immediately following the end of the negotiations, all four airlines stated that they would continue to look for new merger partners. Carlzon was dismissed as CEO of SAS on 28 September. Rainer Gut was forced to leave Swissair in April 1995. Swissair chose to stay outside the large alliances, instead creating SAirGroup and purchasing minority stakes a number of smaller airlines in Europe, creating the Qualiflyer Group in 1999. Swissair also lost its connections with Delta following the latter's alliance with Air France. By 2001, Swissair was bankrupt. SAS joined forces with Lufthansa, who along with United Airlines, Air Canada, and Thai Airways International founded Star Alliance in 1997. KLM continued to integrate its operations with Northwest. In 1998, KLM attempted a full-fledged merger with Alitalia, but the agreement was abandoned by KLM.Kleymann and Serist√∂: 27 KLM was bought by Air France in 2004 to create Air France-KLM, in which both airlines are considered separate brands.

It lies near the southern bank of the Firth of Clyde, beside the village of Langbank, in the west central Lowlands of Scotland. Finlaystone was a property of the Dennistoun family, and passed to the Cunninghams in the 15th century. It was the seat of the Earl of Glencairn until 1796, and is now the property of the Chief of Clan MacMillan. The house is protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History In the late 14th century, King Robert II confirmed a grant of the lands of Finlaystone to Sir John de Danyelstoun (Dennistoun). He was succeeded by his son, Sir Robert, who was keeper of Dumbarton Castle. When he died in 1399 his estates were divided between his daughters. Elizabeth inherited Newark Castle, while Margaret inherited Finlaystone. In 1405 Margaret married Sir William Cunningham, whose family held the estate as the seat of Clan Cunningham until the 19th century. William's grandson Alexander Lord Kilmaurs (1426‚Äì1488) was created Earl of Glencairn in 1488. The family were supporters of the Scottish Reformation, hosting the world's first Protestant Reformed communion service by the preacher John Knox in 1556. The architect John Douglas was commissioned to design a new house in 1746, but building works were not carried out until 1764. The new house incorporated part of the 15th-century castle. In 1796, the 15th Earl of Glencairn Lord Kilmaurs, Chief of Clan Cunningham, died without issue, and Finlaystone passed to a cousin, Robert Graham of Gartmore, whose family took the name Cunninghame Graham. The Cunninghame Grahams sold Finlaystone in 1862 to Sir David Carrick-Buchanan, who in turn sold it in 1882 to George Jardine Kidston. Kidston commissioned the architect John James Burnet to carry out a Scots Baronial style remodelling of the house, completed in 1903. The grounds of the house were extended and planted during the early 20th century. Kidston's granddaughter Marian married General Sir Gordon MacMillan, Chieftain of the Clan MacMillan. Their son George Gordon MacMillan is the current chief and owner of Finlaystone. The estate is operated as a visitor attraction, with walks and play areas in the gardens.

Sensorimotor integration is not a static process. For a given stimulus, there is no one single motor command. \\"Neural responses at almost every stage of a sensorimotor pathway are modified at short and long timescales by biophysical and synaptic processes, recurrent and feedback connections, and learning, as well as many other internal and external variables\\".  Overview  The integration of the sensory and motor systems allows an animal to take sensory information and use it to make useful motor actions. Additionally, outputs from the motor system can be used to modify the sensory system's response to future stimuli. To be useful it is necessary that sensory-motor integration be a flexible process because the properties of the world and ourselves change over time. Flexible sensorimotor integration would allow an animal the ability to correct for errors and be useful in multiple situations. To produce the desired flexibility it's probable that nervous systems employ the use of internal models and efference copies. = Transform sensory coordinates to motor coordinates = Prior to movement, an animal's current sensory state is used to generate a motor command. To generate a motor command, first, the current sensory state is compared to the desired or target state. Then, the nervous system transforms the sensory coordinates into the motor system's coordinates, and the motor system generates the necessary commands to move the muscles so that the target state is reached. = Efference copy = An important aspect of sensorimotor integration is the efference copy. The efference copy is a copy of a motor command that is used in internal models to predict what the new sensory state will be after the motor command has been completed. The efference copy can be used by the nervous system to distinguish self-generated environmental changes, compare an expected response to what actually occurs in the environment, and to increase the rate at which a command can be issued by predicting an organism's state prior to receiving sensory input. = Internal model= An internal model is a theoretical model used by a nervous system to predict the environmental changes that result from a motor action. The assumption is that the nervous system has an internal representation of how a motor apparatus, the part of the body that will be moved, behaves in an environment. Internal models can be classified as either a forward model or an inverse model.  Forward model  This figure depicts an example of combination of a forward model and an inverse model. Here the reference input is the target sensory state that controller (inverse model) will use to compute a motor command. The plant (motor unit) acts out the motor command which results in a new sensory state. This new sensory state can be compared to the state predicted by the forward model to obtain an error signal. This error signal can be used to correct the internal model or the current movement. A forward model is a model used by the nervous system to predict the new state of the motor apparatus and the sensory stimuli that result from a motion. The forward model takes the efference copy as an input and outputs the expected sensory changes. Forward models offer several advantages to an organism. Advantages: * The estimated future state can be used to coordinate movement before sensory feedback is returned. * The output of a forward model can be used to differentiate between self-generated stimuli and non-self-generated stimuli. * The estimated sensory feedback can be used to alter an animal's perception related to self-generated motion. * The difference between the expected sensory state and sensory feedback can be used to correct errors in movement and the model. *  Inverse model An inverse model behaves oppositely of a forward model. Inverse models are used by nervous systems to estimate either the motor command that caused a change in sensory information or to determine the motor command that will reach the target state.  Examples  = Gaze stabilization = During flight, it is important for a fly to maintain a level gaze; however, it is possible for a fly to rotate. The rotation is detected visually as a rotation of the environment termed optical flow. The input of the optical flow is then converted into a motor command to the fly's neck muscles so that the fly will maintain a level gaze. This reflex is diminished in a stationary fly compared to when it is flying or walking. = Singing crickets = Male crickets sing by rubbing their forewings together. The sounds produced are loud enough to reduce the cricket's auditory system's response to other sounds. This desensitization is caused by the hyperpolarization of the Omega 1 neuron (ON1), an auditory interneuron, due to activation by auditory stimulation. To reduce self-desensitization, the cricket's thoracic central pattern generator sends a corollary discharge, an efference copy that is used to inhibit an organism's response to self-generated stimuli, to the auditory system. The corollary discharge is used to inhibit the auditory system's response to the cricket's own song and prevent desensitization. This inhibition allows the cricket to remain responsive to external sounds such as a competing male's song. = Speech = Sensorimotor integration is involved in the development, production, and perception of speech. Speech development Two key elements of speech development are babbling and audition. The linking of a motor action to a heard sound is thought to be learned. One reason for this is that deaf infants do not canonically babble. Another is that an infant's perception is known to be affected by his babbling. One model of speech development proposes that the sounds produced by babbling are compared to the sounds produced in the language used around the infant and that association of a motor command to a sound is learned.  Speech production  Audition plays a critical role in the production and maintenance of speech. As an example, people who experience adult-onset deafness become less able to produce accurate speech. This decline is because they lack auditory feedback. Another example is acquisition of a new accent as a result of living in an area with a different accent. These changes can be explained through the use of a forward model. In this forward model, the motor cortex sends a motor command to the vocal tract and an efference copy to the internal model of the vocal tract. The internal model predicts what sounds will be produced. This prediction is used to check that the motor command will produce the goal sound so that corrections may be made. The internal model's estimate is also compared to the produced sound to generate an error estimate. The error estimate is used to correct the internal model. The updated internal model will then be used to generate future motor commands.  Speech perception  Sensorimotor integration is not critical to the perception of speech; however, it does perform a modulatory function. This is supported by the fact that people who either have impaired speech production or lack the ability to speak are still capable of perceiving speech. Furthermore, experiments in which motor areas related to speech were stimulated altered but did not prevent the perception of speech. = Patient R.W. = Patient R.W. was a man who suffered damage in his parietal and occipital lobes, areas of the brain related to processing visual information, due to a stroke. As a result of his stroke, he experienced vertigo when he tried to track a moving object with his eyes. The vertigo was caused by his brain interpreting the world as moving. In normal people, the world is not perceived as in moving when tracking an object despite the fact that the image of the world is moved across the retina as the eye moves. The reason for this is that the brain predicts the movement of the world across the retina as a consequence of moving the eyes. R.W., however, was unable to make this prediction.  Disorders  = Parkinson's = Patients with Parkinson's disease often show symptoms of bradykinesia and hypometria. These patients are more dependent on external cues rather than proprioception and kinesthesia when compared to healthy people. In fact, studies using external vibrations to create proprioceptive errors in movement show that Parkinson's patients perform better than healthy people. Patients have also been shown to underestimate the movement of limb when it was moved by researchers. Additionally, studies on somatosensory evoked potentials have evidenced that the motor problems are likely related to an inability to properly process the sensory information and not in the generation of the information. = Huntington's = Huntington's patients often have trouble with motor control. In both quinolinic models and patients, it has been shown that people with Huntington's have abnormal sensory input. Additionally, patients have been shown to have a decrease in the inhibition of the startle reflex. This decrease indicates a problem with proper sensorimotor integration. The \\" various problems in integrating sensory information explain why patients with HD are unable to control voluntary movements accurately.\\" = Dystonia = Dystonia is another motor disorder that presents sensorimotor integration abnormalities. There are multiple pieces of evidence that indicate focal dystonia is related to improper linking or processing of afferent sensory information in the motor regions of the brain. For example, dystonia can be partially relieved through the use of a sensory trick. A sensory trick is the application of a stimulus to an area near to the location affected by dystonia that provides relief. Positron emission tomography studies have shown that the activity in both the supplementary motor area and primary motor cortex are reduced by the sensory trick. More research is necessary on sensorimotor integration dysfunction as it relates to non-focal dystonia. = Restless leg syndrome = Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder. People with RLS are plagued with feelings of discomfort and the urge to move in the legs. These symptoms occur most frequently at rest. Research has shown that the motor cortex has increased excitability in RLS patients compared to healthy people. Somatosensory evoked potentials from the stimulation of both posterior nerve and median nerve are normal. The normal SEPs indicate that the RLS is related to abnormal sensorimotor integration. In 2010, Vincenzo Rizzo et al. provided evidence that RLS sufferers have lower than normal short latency afferent inhibition (SAI), inhibition of the motor cortex by afferent sensory signals. The decrease of SAI indicates the presence of abnormal sensory-motor integration in RLS patients.

It is sometimes said to be the same as 'Yellow Transparent', but 'Yellow Transparent' is sometimes described differently, with fine rather than coarse flesh, and a sub-acid rather than acid flavour.  Local names  Half ripe transparent apples.    * History Yellow transparent apples. White Transparent is a chance seedling which was found in the Wagner nursery in Riga around 1850. The cultivar was widely grown during the 19th century in Europe. It was introduced to France in 1852. It was introduced to North America in 1870 where it was grown commercially as an early dual purpose variety and picked up the name 'Yellow Transparent'. The specimen is still widely grown in Poland, Russia and Sweden where it is sometimes referred to as the Baltic Sea apple. The cultivar was significant because it was an early-season apple in most places. Because of its harsh flavour and hard texture, the apples were often baked in ashes. Description The tree is very hardy and the fruit has a good resistance to scabs, but is at risk of developing canker caused by the Nectria fungi and fireblight. The tree is known to be a good and regular cropper of a medium- sized fruit, which has a very pale green skin which turns to pale yellow with ripening. It is usually harvested while still greenish, since it tends to deteriorate fast while yellow.Apple Cultivars for Indiana It is named \\"transparent\\" because it is almost luminescent in colour and has a white flesh, that is very juicy and has a sharp, refreshing taste.Keepers Nursery (2011) \\"Apple - Malus domestica White Transparent\\", http://www.keepers- nursery.co.uk/product.aspx?id=WHITRA&v;=3 Cooking The fruit is good for cooking into a cream colored puree and is usually harvested for this purpose.

Born in Weimar, Duchess Anna Dorothea was the daughter of John Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Princess Christine Elisabeth of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg. Her father decided she should pursue an ecclesiastical career when she was still a child. From 1681 until 1684, Anna Dorothea was provost of the Quedlinburg monasteries. Upon the death of Princess-Abbess Anna Sophia II, Anna Dorothea was chosen to succeed her, though not without difficulties that required the intervention of the abbey- principality's guardian and fellow Wettin, John George III, Elector of Saxony. The Elector consented to her election on 4 September 1684 and Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I confirmed it on 29 January 1685. In 1698, Frederick Augustus I, who had succeeded to the Electorate of Saxony in 1694 and had been elected King of Poland in 1697, found himself in need of money as the election had cost him a fortune. The King of Poland therefore decided to sell his rights of guardianship of the abbey-principality to Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg. The change was not welcomed by the citizens of Quedlinburg nor by the Princess-Abbess, as it led to diminishing of her power and loss of many of the abbey-principality's possessions. The Princess-Abbess protested against the sale and refused to recognise the Elector of Brandenburg as the abbey- principality's new guardian until military occupation the same year forced her to do so. As many of her predecessors, she often came into conflicts with the Council of the City of Quedlinburg and her guardian. Anna Dorothea suffered poor health in 1703 and went to Carlsbad to recover, but without success. She died the next year. She is buried in Weimar.

According to the Xugao Sengzhuan, written by a monk called Daoxuan during the Tang dynasty, the emperor Yang of Sui held a meeting involving thousands of monks in Yangzhou. During the meeting the founder of Tiantai Buddhism passed by and decided to build a temple in Rugao. He took apart many houses nearby and built the temple. An accompanying pagoda was built at the same time.http://www.rugao.gov.cn/nantongrg/zfxxgk/showinfo.aspx?infoid=2924a1a4-c71d-4189-a2da-818f47929ff7 Brief introduction Dinghui Temple was seriously damaged due to a series of wars during the Song dynasty. At the time of the reign of the Jiajing emperor during the Ming Dynasty, the Yangzhou government donated 46,410 taels to the city of Rugao in order to repair the entire city since they were the victims of frequent raids by wokou (\\"Japanese\\" pirates). During the reign of the Wanli emperor, Dinghui Temple was totally rebuilt and a scripture library was added. In November 1983, the People's Government of Jiangsu Province decided to open the temple to the public. By that time, most of its heritage was ruined and its Buddha statues were heavily damaged. But by the Rugao Government's efforts, Dinghui Temple was restored to its original and many tourists now visit the temple every year.http://www.veryeast.cn/cms/Html/travel/104/2007-3/13/0731321061668940.htm Temple layout Dinghui Temple covers an area of 16 mu and the whole layout presents a shape like the Chinese character ‚ÄúÂõû‚Äù. House churches are outer ring and temples are inside. The gate of the temple faces north, which is rare in China. Daxiong Palace and Scripture Library are both at south facing north.

(2011) Cache-Aware Lock- Free Concurrent Hash Tries. Technical Report, 2011.Prokopec, A., Bronson N., Bagwell P., Odersky M. (2012) Concurrent Tries with Efficient Non-Blocking Snapshots is a concurrent thread-safe lock-free implementation of a hash array mapped trie. It is used to implement the concurrent map abstraction. It has particularly scalable concurrent insert and remove operations and is memory- efficient.Prokopec, A. et al. (2011) Lock-Free Resizeable Concurrent Tries. The 24th International Workshop on Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing, 2011. It is the first known concurrent data-structure that supports O(1), atomic, lock-free snapshots.Prokopec, A. JVM implementation on GitHub  Operation  The Ctrie data structure is a non-blocking concurrent hash array mapped trie based on single-word compare-and-swap instructions in a shared- memory system. It supports concurrent lookup, insert and remove operations. Just like the hash array mapped trie, it uses the entire 32-bit space for hash values thus having low risk of hashcode collisions. Each node may branch to up to 32 sub tries. To conserve memory, each node contains a 32 bits bitmap where each bit indicates the presence of a branch followed by an array of length equal to the Hamming weight of the bitmap. Keys are inserted by doing an atomic compare-and-swap operation on the node which needs to be modified. To ensure that updates are done independently and in a proper order, a special indirection node (an I-node) is inserted between each regular node and its subtries. Ctrie insert operation The figure above illustrates the Ctrie insert operation. Trie A is empty - an atomic CAS instruction is used to swap the old node C1 with the new version of C1 which has the new key k1. If the CAS is not successful, the operation is restarted. If the CAS is successful, we obtain the trie B. This procedure is repeated when a new key k2 is added (trie C). If two hashcodes of the keys in the Ctrie collide as is the case with k2 and k3, the Ctrie must be extended with at least one more level - trie D has a new indirection node I2 with a new node C2 which holds both colliding keys. Further CAS instructions are done on the contents of the indirection nodes I1 and I2 - such CAS instructions can be done independently of each other, thus enabling concurrent updates with less contention. The Ctrie is defined by the pointer to the root indirection node (or a root I-node). The following types of nodes are defined for the Ctrie: structure INode { main: CNode } structure CNode { bmp: integer array: Branch[2^W] } Branch: INode  SNode structure SNode { k: KeyType v: ValueType } A C-node is a branching node. It typically contains up to 32 branches, so W above is 5. Each branch may either be a key- value pair (represented with an S-node) or another I-node. To avoid wasting 32 entries in the branching array when some branches may be empty, an integer bitmap is used to denote which bits are full and which are empty. The helper method flagpos is used to inspect the relevant hashcode bits for a given level and extract the value of the bit in the bitmap to see if its set or not - denoting whether there is a branch at that position or not. If there is a bit, it also computes its position in the branch array. The formula used to do this is: bit = bmp & (1 << ((hashcode >> level) & 0x1F)) pos = bitcount((bit - 1) & bmp) Note that the operations treat only the I-nodes as mutable nodes - all other nodes are never changed after being created and added to the Ctrie. Below is an illustration of the pseudocode of the insert operation: def insert(k, v) r = READ(root) if iinsert(r, k, v, 0, null) = RESTART insert(k, v) def iinsert(i, k, v, lev, parent) cn = READ(i.main) flag, pos = flagpos(k.hc, lev, cn.bmp) if cn.bmp & flag = 0 { ncn = cn.inserted(pos, flag, SNode(k, v)) if CAS(i.main, cn, ncn) return OK else return RESTART } cn.array(pos) match { case sin: INode => { return iinsert(sin, k, v, lev + W, i) case sn: SNode => if sn.k ‚â† k { nsn = SNode(k, v) nin = INode(CNode(sn, nsn, lev + W)) ncn = cn.updated(pos, nin) if CAS(i.main, cn, ncn) return OK else return RESTART } else { ncn = cn.updated(pos, SNode(k, v)) if CAS(i.main, cn, ncn) return OK else return RESTART } } The inserted and updated methods on nodes return new versions of the C-node with a value inserted or updated at the specified position, respectively. Note that the insert operation above is tail-recursive, so it can be rewritten as a while loop. Other operations are described in more detail in the original paper on Ctries.https://axel22.github.io/resources/docs/lcpc-ctries.ppt The data- structure has been proven to be correct \\\\- Ctrie operations have been shown to have the atomicity, linearizability and lock-freedom properties. The lookup operation can be modified to guarantee wait-freedom.  Advantages of Ctries  Ctries have been shown to be comparable in performance with concurrent skip lists, concurrent hash tables and similar data structures in terms of the lookup operation, being slightly slower than hash tables and faster than skip lists due to the lower level of indirections. However, they are far more scalable than most concurrent hash tables where the insertions are concerned. Most concurrent hash tables are bad at conserving memory - when the keys are removed from the hash table, the underlying array is not shrunk. Ctries have the property that the allocated memory is always a function of only the current number of keys in the data-structure. Ctries have logarithmic complexity bounds of the basic operations, albeit with a low constant factor due to the high branching level (usually 32). Ctries support a lock-free, linearizable, constant-time snapshot operation, based on the insight obtained from persistent data structures. This is a breakthrough in concurrent data- structure design, since existing concurrent data-structures do not support snapshots. The snapshot operation allows implementing lock-free, linearizable iterator, size and clear operations - existing concurrent data-structures have implementations which either use global locks or are correct only given that there are no concurrent modifications to the data-structure. In particular, Ctries have an O(1) iterator creation operation, O(1) clear operation, O(1) duplicate operation and an amortized O(logn) size retrieval operation.  Problems with Ctries  Most concurrent data structures require dynamic memory allocation, and lock-free concurrent data structures rely on garbage collection on most platforms. The current implementation of the Ctrie is written for the JVM, where garbage collection is provided by the platform itself. While it's possible to keep a concurrent memory pool for the nodes shared by all instances of Ctries in an application or use reference counting to properly deallocate nodes, the only implementation so far to deal with manual memory management of nodes used in Ctries is the common-lisp implementation cl-ctrie, which implements several stop-and-copy and mark-and- sweep garbage collection techniques for persistent, memory-mapped storage. Hazard pointers are another possible solution for a correct manual management of removed nodes. Such a technique may be viable for managed environments as well, since it could lower the pressure on the GC. A Ctrie implementation in Rust makes use of hazard pointers for this purpose.Rust Ctrie implementation at GitHub  Implementations  A Ctrie implementation for Scala 2.9.x is available on GitHub.

To quote the author: Ctrie is a non-blocking concurrent shared-memory hash trie based on single- word compare-and-swap instructions. Insert, lookup and remove operations modifying different parts of the hash trie can be run independent of each other and do not contend. Remove operations ensure that the unneeded memory is freed and that the trie is kept compact. In 2012, a revised version of the Ctrie data structure was published, simplifying the data structure and introducing an optional constant-time, lock-free, atomic snapshot operation.

This species and the blue-capped motmot, Lesson's motmot, whooping motmot, Amazonian motmot, and Andean motmot were all considered conspecific. Though found on both islands, this bird is more abundant in Tobago than it is in Trinidad. The central crown is black and surrounded by a blue band. There is a black eyemask. The call is a low owl-like ooo-doot. These birds often sit still, and in their dense forest habitat can be difficult to see, despite their size. They eat small prey such as insects and lizards, and will also regularly take fruit. They are known to eat small tree snails, and to use forest floor rocks as 'anvils' to crack open the hard shells of these prey items to access the soft edible bodies within. Like most of the Coraciiformes, motmots nest in tunnels in banks, laying about three or four white eggs.

Career Born in Austria to German parents, Grube returned to Germany in 1933. He attended the Schiller Gymnasium in Berlin. In 1955 Grube obtained a doctorate from the Freie Universit√§t Berlin. He obtained a position in the Arts Library of the Staatliche Museen in Berlin, subsequently becoming assistant to Ernst K√ºhnel, curator of the Islamic collection and one of the first to rank Islamic art on an equal basis with classical and Western art. Under K√ºhnel, Grube's interest in Medieval art broadened to encompass Islamic art, which occupied him for the rest of his life during which he became recognized as one of the leading world authorities. In 1958 Grube obtained a one-year fellowship at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, directed at that time by James J. Rorimer. He remained there until 1969, with an official appointment in 1962 in the Islamic department, of which he became the first curator in 1965 and where he was encouraged to build the collection. Grube held a simultaneous teaching appointment as Adjunct Professor of Islamic Art at Columbia University, In 1968 he was appointed Professor of Islamic and Far Eastern art at Hunter College in the City University of New York, In 1959 Grube married Alberta Fabris in Verona, Italy. In 1972 he moved to Italy, first teaching in Padua and Naples, before being appointed as Professor of Islamic art at the University of Venice where he remained from 1977 to 1988. From 1972 to 1978 he served as a member of the Italian Archaeological Mission to Iran. On his retirement in 1988, he moved to London with his second wife, the art historian Eleanor Sims, an expert on Persian painting. In London he continued to publish extensively on Islamic art, acting also as editor of a journal he cofounded with Sims.

This bird can be also found in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the west area of Costa Rica.  Distribution  The Andean motmot is resident in the Andes from Colombia south to Bolivia. In Colombia, occurs in all three major cordilleras, but in Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia found only along the eastern side of the Andes. The southernmost reported records are in the department of La Paz, northwestern Bolivia. The elevational distribution is 1500‚Äì3100 m in Colombia, 1000‚Äì2100 m in Ecuador, 1000‚Äì2400 m in Peru and 1600‚Äì1900 m in Bolivia.  Habitat  The Andean Motmot primarily occurs in humid montane forest, often near steams; it also occurs at forest edge and in second-growth forest. These birds often sit still, and in their dense forest habitat can be difficult to see, despite their size. Like most of the Coraciiformes, motmots nest in tunnels in banks, laying about three or four white eggs.  Appearance  The Andean Motmot is a typical motmot in general aspect: a large bird with a stout, black bill, and a long tail with a \\"racquet\\" tip. The body plumage over generally is green, with the distal portion of the upper surface of the tail blue. The center of the crown and a broad line (\\"mask\\") through the eye are black; there also is a broad blue line bordering the crown, which is light blue on the fore part of the head but that becomes dark blue across the rear of the crown. There also is a short black streak on the center of the breast. = Similar Species = The Andean Motmot is the only species of motmot found in humid montane forests of the Andes, and so usually it is separated by elevation and habitat from other species of motmots. Otherwise it is closely similar to the Amazonian Motmot (Momotus momota), but the Andean Motmot is larger; has purer green underparts, with very little or no tawny tones; has a blue vertical stripe or bar across the rear portion of the black \\"mask;\\" and the upper surface of the racquets usually are solid blue, with no green tones and with no black or dusky tip.

Besides punk rock the music has been stylized as pop punk, power pop, or melodic hardcore.  History  Sweet Empire was formed June 2008 by Rowald van Baardwijk, Rick Diemeer, Jort van de Ven, and Lionn van der Horst. The members knew each other from their local music scene. The band's first performance was in October 2008. In 2009 the band won a local band competition and performed on the main stage of the Beeckestijn Pop festival. Two month later the band toured the United Kingdom for the first time and the first recordings were made. Later that year Van Der Horst decided to leave the band and was replaced on drums by Koen Fakkeldij. In 2010 Van Der Horst started a new band called Wanderlust. In 2010 the band released its first 7\\" and compact cassette EP entitled \\"The Flood\\" via Black Death. Furthermore the band played more shows throughout the UK, Belgium, and Germany. Early 2011 the band released a split-cd with Oliver John Ward. In May the band recorded their first full length album. \\"This Season Needs Torches\\" was released on September 1, 2011 via Shield Recordings in the Benelux. The album was released on 12\\" vinyl and cd. After the release the band toured intensively throughout Europe. In 2012 and 2013 the band continued to uphold a heavy touring schedule. In 2013 the band also released a split 7\\" with Fighting Fiction from the UK. Again Shield Recordings released this 7\\" in the Benelux, but Lockjaw Records (UK), and LaserLife Records (AT) released the vinyl as well. Late 2013 Trilob Records released a cassette, entitled 'Cause Vinyl Is For Hipsters, containing all ep's and 7\\"s the band released to that date. 2014 was the year the band recorded and released their second full length, \\"Old Ideas Keep Fighting Us\\", containing 13 new songs. The record was released on September 1 on CD and 12-inch vinyl via Shield Recordings (BeNeLux), Gunner Records (DE), and LaserLife Records (AT). As with all previous releases the album was recorded with Nico van Montfort of XPZ Sound. After the release the band took on their regular touring schedule again and toured throughout Europe. Until 2019 the band toured on the release of \\"Old Ideas Keep Fighting Us\\". Playing shows all around Europe, including Manchester Punk Festival in 2017. During 2018 the band started recording their third full length, \\"A New Cycle\\", with Perimeter Audio. The album was released on April 1st 2019.

The block device created with zram can then be used for swap or as general-purpose RAM disk. The two most common uses for zram are for the storage of temporary files () and as a swap device. Initially, zram had only the latter function, hence the original name \\"compcache\\" (\\"compressed cache\\"). Linux kernel module After four years in Linux's driver staging area, zram was introduced into the mainline Linux kernel in version 3.14, released on March 30, 2014. From Linux kernel version 3.15 onwards (released on June 8, 2014), zram supports multiple compression streams and multiple compression algorithms. Compression algorithms include DEFLATE (\`DEFLATE\`), LZ4 (\`LZ4\`, and \`LZ4HC\` \\"high compression\\"), LZO (\`LZO-RLE\` \\"run-length encoding\\"), Zstandard (\`ZSTD\`), 842 (\`842\`). From kernel 5.1, the default is \`LZO-RLE\`, which has a balance of speed and ratio. Like most other system parameters, the compression algorithm can be selected via sysfs. When used as a compressed swap space, zram is similar to zswap, which is not a general-purpose RAM disk, but rather an in-kernel compressed cache for swap pages. Until the introduction of \`CONFIG_ZRAM_WRITEBACK\` in kernel version 4.14, unlike zswap, zram could not use a hard disk as a backing store, so it cannot move less- frequently used pages to disk. However, zswap requires a backing store, but zram does not. When used for swap, zram (like zswap) allows Linux to make more efficient use of RAM, since the operating system can then hold more pages of memory in the compressed swap than if the same amount of RAM had been used as application memory or disk cache. This is particularly effective on machines that do not have much memory. In 2012, Ubuntu briefly considered enabling zram by default on computers with small amounts of installed RAM. A compressed swap space with zram and zswap also offers advantages for low-end hardware devices such as embedded devices and netbooks. Such devices usually use flash-based storage, which has limited lifespan due to write amplification, and also use it to provide swap space. The reduction in swap usage as a result of using zram effectively reduces the amount of wear placed on such flash-based storage, resulting in prolonging its usable life. Also, using zram results in a significantly reduced I/O for Linux systems that require swapping. Google's Chrome OS uses zram by default since 2013. Android includes zram since version 4.4.Google, Android KitKat  Android Developers. Lubuntu also started using zram in its version 13.10.

Early career Buck's 1911 sheet music cover for \\"Everybody's Doin' It Now\\" by Irving Berlin. Buck was born in Detroit, growing up in Corktown. He studied at Detroit Art Academy, which had been founded by Joseph Gies and Francis P. Paulus. He illustrated for music publishers Ted Snyder, Edward H. Pfeiffer, and Jerome H. Remick. His cover illustrations had a personal touch and showed art deco and art nouveau elements. Dean Cornwell called him \\"the first artist I ever copied\\". By 1910 Buck was writing lyrics for composer Dave Stamper; his first hit was \\"Daddy has a Sweetheart, and Mother is her Name\\". He wrote about 500 songs, including \\"In the Cool of the Evening\\", \\"No Foolin'\\", \\"Garden of My Dreams\\", \\"Someone, Someday, Somewhere\\", and \\"Hello, 'Frisco\\". After 1914 he gave up illustration due to his failing eyesight.

In the August 1915 Frolic he gave Will Rogers a break, permitting him to introduce topical humour into his act despite Ziegfeld's misgivings. He also discovered Ed Wynn. In 1919, he persuaded Joseph Urban to design the sets for the Follies. In 1926, Rogers dubbed Buck \\"the Frank W. Stearns of the Ziegfeld Administration\\".Rogers 2010, p.141 Later career Buck became wealthy and had a luxurious lifestyle. He was a neighbor of F. Scott Fitzgerald at Great Neck, and may have inspired elements of The Great Gatsby. Ring Lardner, who collaborated with Buck on several plays, called Buck's living room \\"the Yale Bowl ‚Äî with lamps\\". Buck was also a friend of O. O. McIntyre. and acquaintance of Louisiana Senator Huey P. Long (Huey Long, T. Harry Williams, 1969). In 1927 Buck bought the Waldorf Theatre, renaming it the Gene Buck Waldorf, and producing and directing his own musical Take the Air there. He collaborated with Mischa Elman and Augustus Thomas on an operetta. ASCAP Buck was president of ASCAP from 1925 to 1942, an era in which the growing popularity of radio was hitting songwriters' previously primary market for sheet music. His tenure also coincided with several anti-trust investigations by the US government, and the 1941 ASCAP boycott when radio stations demanded reduced performance royalties. The relative failure of the boycott precipitated his being voted out as president. In 1940, he served as Master of Ceremonies for the popular song portion of a \\"Carousel of American Music\\", a famous concert series held in San Francisco on September 24. The concert had Irving Berlin, George M. Cohan, Jerome Kern, Hoagy Carmichael, WC Handy, Johnny Mercer - and many more of America's top songwriting talents performing their own compositions. The recording was added to the National Recording Registry in 2016. Before this, Buck appointed an ASCAP committee which in 1943 produced a revised schedule of songwriter payment levels; the schedule was dubbed the \\"Ahlert Plan\\" after Buck's successor as ASCAP president. He became president of the Catholic Actors' Guild of America in 1944. Personal life Buck married actress Helen Falconer (d.1968) in a Catholic ceremony in New York City on 2 October 1919. He died after emergency surgery at North Shore Hospital, Manhasset. At his death, he was president of the Catholic Actors Guild.

The initiative is funded by the EPSRC, with more than ten million pounds of funding awarded between 2006 and 2013. Background The initial motivation for the establishment of a research programme in large-scale complex IT systems was the publication of a 2004 report by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the British Computer Society. This report examined the causes of failure of a number of large software projects and made several recommendations for research to address some of these problems. A second report, authored by Seth Bullock & Dave Cliff and also published in 2004, was commissioned by the UK Government's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) Office of Science and Technology and carried the title Complexity and Emergent Behaviour in ICT Systems The main conclusions of this report were that the primary challenges needing to be addressed in the UK are institutional and cultural obstacles to appropriate interdisciplinary research and that there was an urgent need to address omissions in UK undergraduate computer science education. In October 2005, Dave Cliff was appointed Director of the LSCITS initiative by the EPSRCEPSRC Annual Report 2006-7 p. 10/11 and was asked to consult extensively with industry on their problems in this area and, on the basis of this consultation, to form a consortium to tackle these problems. The results of the consultation were that the key concerns of industry were socio- technical issues arising from the interactions between organisations, people and systems and in high-integrity systems engineering. On the basis of this, a consortium was formed with two partners (York, Oxford) focusing on formal methods and high-integrity systems and two partners (Leeds, St Andrews) focusing on socio-technical systems. Subsequently, a further project focusing on cloud computing was approved with Bristol, St Andrews and Aston Universities as partners. The five-year research project started in October 2007 with the associated EngD program starting in October 2009.  Partners  * University of Bristol. Department of Computer Science (Prof Dave Cliff) * University of Leeds. Institute of Health Sciences (Prof Justin Keen).

Department of Computer Science (Prof John McDermid, Prof Tim Kelly, Prof Richard Paige, Dr Radu Calinescu)  Research  The aim of the LSCITS research project is: :\\"to improve existing technical approaches to complex systems engineering and to develop new socio-technical approaches that help us understand the complex interactions between organisations, processes and systems\\". The LSCITS stack (Figure 1) shows the research areas that are particularly relevant to LSCITS. File:LSCITS-stack.jpg The focus of the work of the project was initially in the following areas: * Complexity in organisations (led by University of Leeds) * Socio-technical systems engineering (led by University of St Andrews). * Predictable software systems(led by University of Oxford) * High-integrity systems (led by University of York) Work on mathematical foundations was not included as these were funded in a separate research programme by the EPSRC with complexity science research centres at the University of Bristol and the University of Warwick. A further centre on complex systems simulation was funded later at the University of Southampton. The work on novel computational approaches was superseded by work on cloud computing as the significance of this area emerged during the project. The Key Publications below describe the work of the project in more detail. The LSCITS EngD programme The LSCITS EngD programme is an Engineering Doctorate scheme, coordinated by the University of York that focuses on training and research in complex IT systems. Students on the programme take a range of core and optional taught modules and carry out research in conjunction with an industrial sponsor. The key difference between this programme and a conventional PhD is that students spend the majority of their time working with the industrial sponsor and may submit a portfolio thesis, describing several related research projects on a common theme, rather than a single topic. Core modules on the scheme include * Empirical Methods for LSCITS * High-Integrity Systems Engineering * Predictable Software Systems * Socio-Technical Systems * Systems Engineering for LSCITS * Technology Innovation Students take a number of optional modules in addition to these core topics from computer science, mathematics and management. Overall, the core and optional modules are intended to provide EngD students with breadth as well as depth in LSCITS topics. In parallel with the taught part of the programme, students carry out research; research projects span LSCITS topics, including socio-technical systems, high- performance computing, cloud computing, systems and software engineering, safety critical systems, interactive and accessible systems, and advanced decision making. EngD industrial sponsors include leading multi-national corporations, through to small-to-medium-sized enterprises who wish to build research capability and capacity. Management and governance  Operational management of the entire LSCITS Initiative is the responsibility of the Director (Dave Cliff), and the two Initiative Co-Directors (Ian Sommerville and John McDermid). Ian Sommerville manages integration across the various LSCITS work-packages and activities. John McDermid works with Richard Paige, the LSCITS EngD Centre Director, to manage the York-based LSCITS Engineering Doctorate programme. The Director reports to the chair of the LSCITS International Scientific Advisory Board, and to the chair of the LSCITS National Stakeholder Board. These two boards provide their guidance and advice on the LSCITS research and training programmes.

Effects ¬£6285 2s. 5d.\\" Is best known as an ornithological painter and printmaker, and Professor of Fine Art at the University of Reading. He was the author of several art books for students, and also wrote and illustrated books for children. Life Allen W. Seaby was a student at Reading School of Art under Frank Morley Fletcher, where he developed a lifelong passion for colour woodblock printing in the Japanese style. Published on a range of subjects, including art history and technique as well as children‚Äôs literature, Seaby taught fine art at the University of Reading for many years, eventually becoming a professor and head of department. Among his students were Kathleen Hale, the creator of Orlando the Marmalade Cat: A Camping Holiday (1938) and its sequels, and C.H. Chapman, who went on to take over the drawing of Billy Bunter. Seaby‚Äôs illustrations are well-known to post-war British children through his watercolours for two Ladybird books on British birds by Brian Vesey-Fitzgerald: British Birds and their Nests (1953) and A Second Book of British Birds and their Nests (1954). Allen W. Seaby was the grandfather of noted wildlife illustrator and printmaker, Robert Gillmor. Pony stories Seaby was an early exponent of the pony story for children, as Alison Haymonds points out: : Seaby‚Äôs pony books were published between 1923 and 1949, and like many other interwar writers on equine themes, he produced both fiction and factual material. Seaby‚Äôs pony books typically depict the life stories of native ponies, and are frequently episodic, with incidents such as the round up, or time in the circus being typical scenarios between the foal‚Äôs birth on a mountain or moorland and old age. Where Seaby differs from most interwar pony story writers is in his perspective as a naturalist, observing the ponies‚Äô behaviour, as compared to the more usual point of view which has the ponies being brought on as children‚Äôs riding ponies. As Seaby comments, in the foreword to British Ponies: Running Wild and Ridden (1936): Seaby wrote and illustrated six fiction titles about native ponies in their habitats between 1923 and 1948. Skewbald: The New Forest Pony (1923) and Sons of Skewbald (1937) are set in the New Forest. First published in 1928, Exmoor Lass contains six short stories exploring the lives of five of Britain‚Äôs native pony breeds: the Exmoor, the Shetland, the New Forest, the Dartmoor and the Welsh. Dinah: The Dartmoor Pony (1935) is perhaps the most similar of Seaby‚Äôs novels to the typical formulaic pony story: separated from her dam as a foal, Dinah finds her way onto a farm where twelve-year-old Dolly looks after her, eventually breaking her in, before winning two red rosettes in a local gymkhana. Sheltie: The Story of a Shetland Pony (1939) describes a young riding school owner's attempt to ride home from the Highlands to the South of England, leading Sheltie. Mona: The Welsh Pony (1948), set along the Mawddach estuary near Abermaw (Barmouth) and in the hills to the north, tells Mona‚Äôs story from her birth on her native moorland, through her breaking-in and usage, and into older age. Non-fiction pony books Two non-fiction titles were published in 1936 and 1949. The first, British Ponies: Running Wild and Ridden (1936), is a large format hardback book of drawings, and the second a paperback Puffin picture book, entitled Our Ponies (1949). Historical fiction for children In addition to bird illustrations and pony books, Seaby also produced a number of historical books for children, which all demonstrate an underlying interest in archaeology, art history and landscape, as well as ponies. Omrig and Nerla (1934), for example, is set in the Bronze Age, and the novel opens with what is for Seaby quite familiar territory: herd behaviour, a challenge from a lone stallion and the birth of a foal. Art history and technique For students, Seaby produced a series on art history, and practical technique books relating to the art of the woodcut, for which he is most well-known. Reviewing the first in Seaby‚Äôs series of books for art students, Art in the Life of Mankind (1928 onwards), in The Art Bulletin, Marguerite Wencelius noted a synthesis of ‚Äòboth idealistic feeling and scientific qualities of objectivity, clearness and precision‚Äô (1929: 222). Seaby's Japanese-style woodblock print of Stonehenge is particularly striking. Reputation Seaby‚Äôs obituary in The Times (30 July 1953: 8) paid tribute above all to his ability to synthesise art and nature: his \\"studies of wildlife\\", the writer noted, are significant for the way in which \\"naturalistic truth is combined with decorative disposition\\", and \\"nobody could fail to be impressed by the illustrations in such books as Skewbald: The New Forest Pony; British Ponies; and The White Buck\\". Cathy Sloan concludes in an article for Nature in Art that Seaby's work bridges ‚Äòthe gap between fine art and so called \\"wildlife art\\"‚Äô (1995: 10). Pierre Gusman admired his woodcuts in the Japanese style, and compared him with John Dickson Batten, William Giles and Sydney Lee in that field.

Early life and civil war Corput was born near Brussels in Belgium. His exact date of birth is unknown, and has variously been put between 1824 and 1826. In 1848 he belonged to a group of Belgians who emigrated to the United States after the incorporation of Belgium into the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, which caused dissatisfaction among the French-speaking Belgian elite.George Magruder Battey, A History of Rome and Floyd County, pp.355-6 The group, that included several family members like Corputs younger brother Felix, traveled via New York and Charleston. As the Cherokee Indians had recently been dispossessed of Northwest Georgia, freeing the land for further settlement, the Corputs settled as farmers in the area at Cave Spring. When the Civil War started in 1861 Corput joined the Confederate States Army. He was commissioned as a Third Lieutenant (1861)George Magruder Battey, A History of Rome and Floyd County, p.365 in the Cherokee Artillery battery; a unit recruited from the Floyd and Cherokee counties. Several of his relatives joined the unit, too, his brother Felix being the Quartermaster Sergeant. The unit was surrendered during the Siege of Vicksburg, but quickly returned to the field afterwards. By 1864 Corput had been promoted to captain and commanded the battery.

Zulu, who became the first Zambian to publicly acknowledge his HIV status in 1990, was considered one of the world's leading HIV and AIDS activists. At the time, people diagnosed with HIV/AIDS faced widespread discrimination in Zambia. Zulu was born in Lusaka, Zambia, in 1964. He was the sixth of his parents' thirteen children. In 1990, Zulu made headlines by becoming the first person to announce his HIV status in the country. He became one of the first Africans to become involved in the AIDS crisis on a worldwide level. Zulu was further diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1997. Zulu lost four of his brothers to tuberculosis during his lifetime due to little access to anti-TB drugs, widely available in other countries. The deaths of his brothers and his own diagnosis led Zulu to focus his advocacy on behalf of tuberculosis patients and efforts to curb the disease. He explained in the late 1990s, \\"TB treatment gives patients more time. If my brothers had survived TB they might have lived long enough to access HIV drugs like me. They shouldn‚Äôt have died.\\" Zulu noted the link between HIV/AIDS status of patients and a diagnosis with tuberculosis. From 1997 to 2011, Zulu called for increased financial investments to fight the spread of tuberculosis, as well as TB cases directly related to HIV and AIDS. Former South African President Nelson Mandela spoke of Zulu saying, \\"There have been so few TB survivors who have stepped forward to share their stories. We need more advocates like Winstone to tell the world about TB and the effect it has on so many millions of people.\\" Zulu was taken to University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka on October 11, 2011. He died from complications of AIDS at the hospital during the early morning hours of October 12, 2011.

Released on December 5, 2010, it is part of Amazon.com's cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The name is a reference to TCP or UDP port 53, where DNS server requests are addressed, and a reference to U.S. Route 66. In addition to being able to route users to various AWS services, including EC2 instances, Route 53 also enables AWS customers to route users to non-AWS infrastructure and to monitor the health of their application and its endpoints. Route 53's servers are distributed throughout the world. Amazon Route 53 supports full, end-to-end DNS resolution over IPv6. Recursive DNS resolvers on IPv6 networks can use either IPv4 or IPv6 transport to send DNS queries to Amazon Route 53. Customers create \\"hosted zones\\" that act as a container for four name servers. The name servers are spread across four different TLDs. Customers are able to add, delete, and change any DNS records in their hosted zones. Amazon also offers domain registration services to AWS customers through Route 53. Amazon provides an SLA of the service always being available at all times (100% available). One of the key features of Route 53 is programmatic access to the service that allows customers to modify DNS records via web service calls. Combined with other features in AWS, this allows a developer to programmatically bring up a machine and point to components that have been created via other service calls such as those to create new S3 buckets or EC2 instances. Supported DNS record types * A * AAAA * CAA * CNAME * MX * NAPTR * NS * PTR * SOA * SPF * SRV * TXT Additionally, there is a Route 53-specific virtual record type called \\"Alias\\". Alias records act similarly to CNAME records but are resolved on the server side and appear to clients as an A record. They can be used to create transparent references to other AWS resources that only provide DNS names and not IP addresses, such as an Elastic Load Balancer or a CloudFront distribution. Because alias records are resolved on the server-side and return A records to clients they can be used in domain apex records in a similar way to a CNAME record, where CNAME records are disallowed for this use by RFC 2181 See also * List of managed DNS providers * Pennsylvania Route 53, a road in Pennsylvania that connects rural communities References External links * Amazon Route 53 main page * Amazon Route 53 API Reference Route 53 Category:Domain Name System ","title":"Amazon Route 53"},{"id":"33677136","text":"Marcel Jovine (1921 - January 20, 2003), was an Italian-born American sculptor who was best known as the creator of the toys \\"The Visible Man\\" and \\"The Visible Woman\\".

It existed from 1903 until 1985, when it merged with First Union (which was subsequently acquired by Wachovia and then Wells Fargo.) The company constructed two significant buildings in Downtown Jacksonville: 121 Atlantic Place (formerly the Atlantic National Bank Building) and the Schultz Building (formerly the Atlantic National Bank Annex). History Founded in 1903 by Edward W. Lane, railroad magnate Thomas P. Denham, and Fred W. Hoyt, Atlantic National Bank was one of the most significant locally based banking institutions of its era. As time passed the bank went national, and developed correspondent relationships with banks in other regions of the country, including Wells Fargo in San Francisco. The bank was initially located in the Dyal-Upchurch Building in Downtown Jacksonville, but built its own building, the Atlantic National Bank Building (now 121 Atlantic Place) between 1908 and 1909. The building narrowly lost out in a race to become Jacksonville's first skyscraper, but at in height, it was slightly taller than its competition, making it the tallest building in Florida at the time. By 1926 the bank had grown so much that it opened the Atlantic National Bank Annex (now the Schultz Building) directly behind the main building. Both buildings are among the most historically significant in Jacksonville. In 1961 Edward Lane, Jr., son of founder Edward Lane, was named president. In 1976 he became chairman of the holding company, and the bank grew to include assets of $3.9 billion. In 1985 Lane negotiated the merger of Atlantic National Bank with First Union of Charlotte, North Carolina. First Union was subsequently absorbed by Wachovia and then Wells Fargo.

Later they were joined by J.J. Vallejo on drums and Juan Francisco Cueto as bassist, completing the original lineup. The band incorporates elements of thrash metal, death metal, groove metal and hardcore. They later moved to Colchester, England. The band received international attention with their second studio album, Dead Soul, released in 1997. Their next release, Sicario, established them as a known band in Europe and received good reviews. Criminal has released seven studio albums, two live albums, and two demos. They will release their eighth album, entitled Fear Itself, on 11 March 2016.  History  In late 1991 Reisenegger Anton joined Rodrigo Contreras to start a new thrash metal band: Criminal. Anton was already known in the local underground scene, and had received recognition by bands like Napalm Death and Dismember. The latter band had played with Rodrigo Contreras before. Their debut show was in April 1992, opening for Kreator. That same year they released two demos that got wide distribution in the local scene. Their second demo, Forked received good reviews by international heavy metal magazines like Metal Hammer in Holanda. In 1994 they recorded their first album, Victimized, independently and sold 1000 copies in three weeks of its release. The album got the attention of the major BMG label. The album was distributed in countries like Mexico, Argentina and Japan. The videos of Self Destruction and Disorder were frequently broadcast on MTV Latin America on the Head Bangers show, rapidly gaining reputation internationally. After that they made their first appearance outside their country, in Buenos Aires, Argentina and Montevideo. In 1995, they played at the Festival of Latin American Metal in Guadalajara, Mexico. After this show J.J. Vallejo was replaced by Jimmy Ponce, drummer of Slavery. In 1996 the group opened shows for Bruce Dickinson and Mot√∂rhead, also releasing the EP Live Disorder. In 1997 they released Dead Soul, which is held in high regard by fans and critics alike. The album was released in the United States and Europe. They collaborated with Exodus and Napalm Death for the release-show of the album. In late 1998 they released the compilation album Live Slave Master which has both studio and live performances, and the demo songs from Forked. In early 2000 Reisenegger and Contreras began producing the third album, Cancer. The album was heavily criticized by fans as they had a shift in their music style, the album being labeled as a commercial record and far from the aggressive style of their early albums. However, the album was well received in Europe. The 2001, Reisenegger moved to England and met the lead singer of Extreme Noise Terror, which he would join as a guitarist for their tour the following year. It was here that here would get to know a member of that band, Zac O'Neil (drums), who would lead him to undertake other musical directions. Anton showed him Criminal material to convince the drummer to continue the project. Zac already had planned to form a band with bassist Robin Eaglestone (ex Cradle of Filth) and keyboardist Mark Royce (from Entwined). Both immediately accepted the Chilean's idea, meaning that Jimmy Ponce and Juan Francisco Cueto were no longer in the band. Regarding the internationalization of the band and their settlement in England, Anton said the following in an interview in Chile: > I honestly think that if we had been in Chile we would no longer exist. If > you don't see results and you begin to start doing the same thing, people > get bored of you too. It makes no sense. That was our situation, but I think > that anyone, if he gets into a certain routine, in the end he gets > frustrated and has no motivation.\\" With these new members he started a tour in Europe, one of the highlights was a performance at the Wacken Open Air festival in Germany. Due to internal problems, Anton Reisenegger & Robin Eaglestone suffered personal differences before \\"No Gods No Masters\\" was completed, Robin was ejected from the band. No Gods No Masters was released in Europe on 23 February 2004 in Springvale Studios in Suffolk, United Kingdom. The name was inspired by one of the anarchist movements. The bass parts were improvised by the guitarists of the band. In subsequent tours they were rejoined by band's original bassist and founder: Juan Francisco Cueto. With this began a new tour, including a mini tour of Chile. Soon the band began work on a new album which was released in 2005 under the name Minion. This was recorded at Stage One Studios in Borgentreich, Germany and was voted one of the ten best albums of 2005 by Terrorizer magazine. The sound of the album returned to the simplicity and power of their riffs. The graphic design on the album cover was provided by Claudio Bergamin, who had participated in the design of No Gods No Masters. Despite the success of the tours Criminal again made a lineup change. Cueto decided to retire, giving way to Glover Staff who had played with the band on tour with Six Feet Under. Nevertheless, due to the abrupt departure of Glover it was Dan Biggin who played with the band on the final shows of the tour. In 2006 and 2007, the band continued to promote the new album. Criminal opened for Megadeth in their tour through Chile in 2008.. In an early 2009 the band ventured on the acclaimed White Hell Tour where they were promoting their latest album called White Hell. On 26 January 2010 the band opened for Metallica at the Santiago Equestrian Club.. Despite the stability that had the group among its members, during a European tour fans noticed the absence of a signature member of the quartet, Rodrigo Contreras. His replacement was Olmo Cascallar who hails from the Basque band Gamora. In respect, Anton Reisenegger issued the following statement on his website: > I know that a lot of you are a little confused by the absence of Rodrigo > during these concerts, so I think that it would be better to tell you what > the situation is.

From the 1960s, she did much to enhance Denmark's reputation for modern furniture design with her clear, comfortable lines. She also edited the Danish magazine Mobilia and compiled a four-volume work on Danish furniture. Early life Jalk was born in Copenhagen. After graduating from high school in modern languages and philosophy, she studied at the Design School for Women (1940‚Äì43) under cabinetmaker Karen Margrethe Conradsen. She completed her studies at the Danish Design School in 1946, while receiving additional instruction from Kaare Klint at the Royal Academy's Furniture School. While consolidating contacts with numerous furniture designers, she took part in the annual competitions of the Design Museum and the Design School's furniture department where she also taught from 1950 to 1960.S√∏ren Sass, \\"Grete Jalk (1920 - 2006)\\", Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon. Retrieved 8 November 2011. Furniture design Grete Jalk: plywood GJ Chair In 1953, Jalk opened her own design studio. Inspired by Alvar Aalto's laminated bent-plywood furniture and Charles Eames' moulded plywood designs, she began to develop her own boldly curved models. General interest in her unconventional models grew only slowly although they were sought after for exhibitions and collections. In 1963, the English newspaper Daily Mail launched a competition for a chair for a man and a chair for a woman. Despite the fact that Jalk won first prize with two different laminated armchairs, the He Chair and the She Chair, they never really came into production. Her associate, cabinetmaker and furniture manufacturer Poul Jeppesen, had made some prototypes but they were burnt in a fire, bringing the project to an end. In 2008, however, Lange Production began industrial production of the She Chair.Signe Brogaard, \\"Grete Jalk\\", Bo Bedre. Retrieved 8 November 2011. This was not Jalk‚Äôs last collaboration with Jeppesen, she built upon her work in laminated plywood furniture with the creation of the side chair of 1962. Side by side with these rather advanced experiments, Jalk developed many simple sets of furniture for manufacturers, including a high desk and stool, a set of shelves in Oregon pine and a series of chairs with upholstered seats and backs on a curved steel base. Her industrially produced furniture has clear, comfortable lines. The pieces are especially well suited for quick, straightforward production schedules. Economic in their use of materials, they soon became competitive, increasing Denmark's international reputation for furniture design. Firms in the United States and Finland have manufactured some of her lines. The designs she developed for modern homes included a wall-mounted storage system (1961), a living-room set with a coffee table (1962), a \\"Watch and Listen\\" unit (1963) with compartments for a home entertainment system to house a stero system, TV, records, tapes and speakers.\\"Grete Jalk\\", Great Dane. Retrieved 8 November 2011. A 1960s rosewood three-piece suite made EUR 6,500 and Renato Zevi‚Äôs chrome rocking chair went for EUR 1,100, double its upper estimate. Best known for her furniture design, including laminated plywood furniture for manufacturer Jeppesen, such as the side chair of 1962, and tubular steel furniture for manufacturer Fritz Henses, such as the easy chair of 1964. In 1963, Jalk designed a moulded teak chair that used two pieces of plywood bent into almost impossible forms. The chair was manufactured for Poul Jeppesen, a company that would help Scandinavia become renowned for fine modern furniture. Jalk also designed wallpaper and upholstery, for example for Unika V√¶v, and silverware for Georg Jensen. Exhibition design Jalk also applied her creative talents to designing exhibitions, one of the best examples being the travelling show she arranged for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1974 which was taken to 25 destinations around the world. The project consisted of a series of cube-shaped, corrigated-cardboard packaging boxes with silkscreen texts and logos. When unpacked, the boxes could be used as stands and wall displays. Supplemented with support rods, they could quickly serve as showcases and light fixtures. Another notable event was her Designs by Danish Women exhibition in Copenhagen's Bella Center in connection with the UN Conference on Women in 1980. Literature Jalk contributed enthusiastically to literature on Danish furniture. Together with Gunnar Bratvold she edited the furniture and interior design magazine Mobilia from 1956 to 1962 and again after Fratvold's death from 1968 to 1974.

Last but not least, the current is gentle too. Above all, the sand deposits constantly in the bed. In history, the region was hit by floods frequently, so people built levees for the purpose of governing the flood. As a result, the water level increased continuously year by year.

The logo of the Canadian Manoeuvre Training Centre. = History = CMTC was established in 2004 and delivered its first exercise, Ex MAPLE GUARDIAN in 2006, but assisted in running the Brigade Training Event (BTE) in 2005. In 2006, the primary focus of CMTC was to train Task Forces deploying to Afghanistan. Since the end of the Canadian combat mission in Afghanistan, CMTC continues to design and deliver collective training exercises to maintain the warfighting capabilities of the CA's brigades and battlegroups.  Formation Structure  CMTC manages exercise design, delivery, and execution through leveraging its sub-components = CMTC Headquarters (HQ) = CMTC HQ is the unit responsible for exercise design and planning. The HQ conducts planning conferences, writing boards, and site recces with exercise participants in order to design exercises that will best fit their training aims. During in- house exercises, CMTC HQ leads the exercise control (EXCON). CMTC HQ is also responsible for maintaining connections with Allied training centres and industry partners to incorporate best practices across a wide network. = CMTC Operations Group (Ops Grp) = CMTC Ops Grp is the unit responsible for the execution of exercises. This is done through the employment of its sub- units, which provide a rich training environment, facilitate learning, and inform EXCON. Ops Grp consists of:  Observer Controller Trainers (OCT)  OCTs are experienced officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned members who coach and mentor the training audience, by leveraging their experience, knowledge of doctrine, and interpretation of discrete and aggregate data. CMTC's OCTs support all CMTC-led exercises, and often support other excises for the Canadian Army and Allies. They also provide courses for Canadians and Allies on how to be an OCT, and how to conduct an After-Action Review.  Contemporary Operating Environment Force (COEFOR)  COEFOR provides unconventional, para-military, and host-nation forces and key personalities to role-play in exercises. They cover any gaps the spectrum of personalities in the battlespace, between the Opposing Force (OPFOR), training audience, and the population base. The employment of COEFOR causes soldiers to consider each and every person in the battlespace, and forces them to remain aware throughout the entire exercise. CMTC's COEFOR also supports Allied exercises around the world.  Support Group (Sp Grp)  CMTC has an integral administration and network support capability that provides admin services to its own members and the exercises it leads. = Formation Training Group (Fmn Trg Grp) = Fmn Trg Grp provides training to the Canadian Army at the formation level. This includes the design and delivery of Ex UNIFIED RESOLVE and the provision of the Canadian Army Exercise Planning and Execution Course (CAEPAC) and the Civilian - Military Interagency Planning Seminar (CMIPS). = Army Collective Training (Army CT) = Army CT is a responsible for upholding CMTC's duties as the FCoE for CT doctrine. CMTC's exercises are designed around the achievement of Battle Task Standards (BTS), which are derived from operational needs and implemented in doctrine. Army CT ensures that doctrine is updated as the operational environment shifts, to ensure exercises are relevant to the needs of training audiences.  Exercises  = Ex MAPLE RESOLVE (Ex MR) = Ex MR is the Canadian Army's cornerstone exercise for proving brigades, battlegroups, and their soldiers in the contemporary operating environment. During the exercise, soldiers test their ability to integrate with Allies and other government departments as they hone their warfighting skills within a realistic, complex and demanding environment. The exercise challenges soldiers with fourteen days of force-on-force exercise in an environment that closely models modern conflict, complete with simulated villages populated with professional actors who maintain a pattern of life and interact on a simulated social media environment. There are approximately 5,000 personnel involved in each serial of Ex MR. = Ex UNIFIED RESOLVE (Ex UR) = Ex UR is the Canadian Army's largest and most complex computer- assisted training exercise. The training plays a key role in confirming the operational readiness of the Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group command and control elements and tests their ability to plan and conduct missions, as directed by the Government of Canada, anywhere in the world. During the six day simulation, participants react to computer-generated scenarios to conduct deliberate attacks, mobile defence and humanitarian assistance which simulate an army response to a realistic situation. = Integrated Capstone Exercise (ICE) = CMTC conducts the ICE as part of the CAF's contribution as the Framework Nation for the enhance Forward Presence Battlegroup (eFP BG) Latvia. ICE confirms that the eFP meets the Supreme Allied Commander Europe's (SACEUR) requirements, and that the eight Sending Nations and Framework Nation are effectively integrated into one multinational battlegroup. = Canadian Patrol Concentration (CPC) = CMTC plans and executes the CPC at the request of the Canadian Army. Each team consists of eight soldiers, who cover over 40 km throughout a 72 hour patrol window. Teams must respond to operational challenges in a contested environment with a persistent enemy threat. The scenario includes events such as obstacle crossings, reconnaissance tasks, and responding to enemy actions. CPC is attended by sections from both the Regular and Reserve Force, from Canada and around the world.  Exercise Features  = Weapons Effects Simulation (WES) = The WES system is a live simulation system that represents people, vehicles, and equipment in combat situations. The system includes both vehicle and person-worn systems with laser detectors and projectors, linked to a GPS system that allows each individual soldier's actions and fate on the battlefield to be centrally tracked. The system is provided by CUBIC. = Civilians in the Battlespace (CIBs) = CMTC contracts a population of CIBs who populate several villages and an urban area with approximately 200 actors, the contract is currently held by Allied Container Systems (ACS). Contracted actors speak a language other than English or French ‚Äì training soldiers to integrate interpreters and operate in an environment where the population can communicate without them understanding, and does not always understand them. The CIBs have an integral make-up and production team that coordinates and executes the representation of casualties with realistic injuries. = Exercise Network (EXNET) = CMTC has the capability to run a simulated social media network on top of an isolated network. This allows everyone in the battlespace to interact in a public forum. Access to the network is granted through internet cafes and cellphones in each community. This network reinforces to training audiences that actions in the physical domain impact the information domain, and vice versa. = After-Action Reviews (AARs) = CMTC builds after-action reviews into the various stages of its exercises. CMTC AARs are informed by feedback from OCTs who observe the battle in person and from command nodes, data as shown by WES, and the OPFOR and COEFOR. CMTC's OCTs coordinate all of the available inputs for Commander's to conduct their own AARs. = Multinational training environment = CMTC seeks and accommodates allied partners for all major exercises. CAF members deployed on operations can almost always expect to be working in a multinational context. The regular inclusion of Allies into training opportunities better prepares our soldiers for the realities of integrating people, capabilities, and equipment from other nations.

At the young age of 16 was involved in the gestation of a new musical movement within Chile, Heavy Metal. He began to play with friends to form one of the main bands of the underground world: Pentagram Chile.  Career  = Pentagram (1985-1992, 2007-present) = Pentagram was the first band in which Reisenegger performed as voice, guitar, and frontman. The group debuted on December 28, 1985, with the following lineup: Reisenegger (vocals and lead guitar), Juan Pablo Uribe (guitar), and Eduardo Topelberg (drums). By 1987 the band recorded a demo (Demo I) in which Reisenegger improvised on bass guitar. Due to limited media coverage of the genre at the time, it was left for the fans to spread the albums of different bands. This was primarily accomplished by simply exchanging cassettes among fans and followers. This marketing method made Demo I quite popular within the extreme metal underground scene. In September of that year, Pentagram released their second demo, called Demo II, which was well received. Thanks to internal distribution, the band was able to record a single in Switzerland, through the Chainsaw Murder Records label. The loss of motivation of the group came from the national and international labels' disinterest in their music, which led to decreases in the quality and ingenuity of the music. All this, plus the immaturity of the members, led to the separation of the group. Pentagram said goodbye to their public in 1988 at the Plaza Manuel Rodr√≠guez before a crowd of 2,000 people. On May 27, 2001, a packed Caupolic√°n theater witnessed the return of Pentagram to the stage, this time with both old and new fans. = Fallout (1989) = Fallout was a fairly short-lived project, Reisenegger only lasted a year in the group and then withdrew. The style was more influenced by thrash and power metal, unlike his previous band that was clearly death metal. They released two demos, which did not seem to gain much support. Yet despite the limited success of the project, this was the beginnings of what would be his most ambitious and well-known product: Criminal. = Lock Up (2006-present) = On July 23, 2006, Reisenegger was introduced as the new guitarist of the deathgrind project with Shane Embury, Nicholas Barker, and Tomas Lindberg, Lock Up. = Criminal (1991-present) = Criminal has been seen as the project in which the best of Reisenegger's ideas have been channeled and in which his musical journey has flourished.http://www.criminal1.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=1%3Aanton- reisenegger&catid;=1%3Athe-band&Itemid;=2‚ü®=en Criminal began in 1991 under the command of Reisenegger and Rodrigo Contreras, who were later joined by JJ Vallejo and Francisco \\"Cato\\" Cueto. In 2000, due to many of the same difficulties that led to the breakdown of Pentagram, Reisenegger relocated to England. There he met the vocalist for Extreme Noise Terror, who offered the Chilean a position as the replacement for an absent guitarist for a tour. In this way, Reisenegger met Zac O'Neil, the drummer for Extreme Noise Terror, who manifested his willingness to explore other musical directions, including the possibility of working with Reisenegger. The latter did not hesitate to show O'neil his work from Criminal, which only served to further convince the drummer. The Chilean joined O'neil on a projected already being planned (Cradle of Filth) with Rob Eaglestone and Mark Rogue of Entwined. The style was Thrash Metal with industrial trends, a combination which served to motivated Reisenegger's return to Criminal. He reached out to Rodrigo Contreras and began recording Cancer, first international project and with a new lineup. Since then, Criminal has been based between England and Spain. The band has been very well received by the public, and has performed in various concerts. Tours of Europe and sporadic visits to Chile have been the trend in recent years, each year gaining more followers and establishing notoriety. = United Forces (2012-present) = On December 24, 2012, it was announced that Reisenegger would become the guitarist of the United States-based heavy metal band United Forces, which features two former members of Stormtroopers of Death, vocalist Billy Milano and bassist Dan Lilker, and Nick Barker on drums.

The project includes a plant to concentrate the ore from the Ruashi and Etoile mines, and a modern solvent extraction electrowinning (SX-EW) processing plant. As of 2008, annual capacity was estimated to be 10,000 tonnes of copper and 1,000 tonnes of Cobalt. Location The Ruashi mine is located at an elevation of about above sea level. The climate is sub-tropical, with annual rainfall of about falling mostly in the October to March period. Average temperatures are between and , with no marked difference between summer and winter. The region lies in a zone that would naturally be covered by Miombo Woodland, deciduous tropical woodlands. Lying on the edge of Lubumbashi, much of the woodland has been cleared. Tanganyika Concessions Ltd dug pits and trenches in the area in 1907. Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga (UMHK) discovered the Etoile ore body in 1911, and the Ruashi ore body in 1919. For the next half century both properties were quarried intermittently for their high-grade copper ore. UMHK was nationalized in 1967. Control of all copper and cobalt exploration and production was given to G√©camines, established as the state mining company. Ownership The Ruashi mining project is operated by Ruashi Mining, which was originally 80% owned by Metorex of South Africa and 20% by the DRC state-owned G√©camines. Ruashi Mining is now 75% owned by Metorex. Development 1,269 drillholes have been sunk on the Ruashi property over the years, and further drilling was conducted in 2003 and in 2005 to confirm asset size estimates. The project was developed in two phases. In the $31 million first phase, a concentrator was built at Ruashi using idle plant from O'okiep. This was to initially process existing oxide stockpiles. The Sable processing plant in Zambia was then used to extract copper metal and cobalt salt from the concentrate. Annual production capacity was estimated as 10,000 tonnes of copper cathode and 1,000 tonnes of cobalt carbonate. Phase two involved expanding the concentrator and building a new acid-leaching and SX-EW plant to produce copper and cobalt metal on site. In this phase, which used higher-grade copper ore from the Ruashi mine, capacity increased to 45,000 tonnes of copper cathode and about 3,500 tonnes of cobalt carbonate or metal. Capital costs of phase two were estimated at $335 million. Meterox, with debt of $2 billion in 2009, was forced to sell other assets in order to fund the phase two expansion. Production Initial production began in June 2006, processing material from 56 dumps and tailings dams at Ruashi and Etoile. There were delays in ramp-up, mainly caused by a shortage of water. The mine had been taking water from open cast pits. Ruashi had to install pipelines to access water from deeper in the pits, and had to drill boreholes to gain a predictable supply. In the year ended 30 June 2008, Ruashi produced 10,767 tonnes of copper. Production of copper and cobalt from tailings near the Ruashi Mine continued until December 2008. The second phase, mining the Ruashi ore body, started in the second half of 2008, with refining at the new SX/EW plant. 21,371 tonnes of refined copper were produced in 2009. Planned production levels from 2010 to 2013 were 36,000 tonnes per year of refined copper and 4,500 tonnes per year of contained cobalt. As of 2010 the mine had access to about 13.3 million tons of ore, graded at 2.9% copper and 0.43% cobalt. On this basis, the project had a life of about ten years.

It is analogous to stray light in other optical systems; scattered light reaches the retina but does not contribute to forming a correct image. One can observe the effect of straylight by looking at a distant bright light source against a dark background. If the source is small, it would look like a small bright spot if the eye imaged it perfectly. Scattering in the eye makes the source appear spread out, surrounded by glare. The disability glare caused by such a situation has been found to correspond precisely to the effect of true light.Vos JJ. \\"Disability glare - a state of the art report\\". Commission International de l'Eclairage Journal. 1984;3/2:39-53 As a consequence, disability glare was subsequently defined by this true light, called \\"straylight\\".  Individual differences  Straylight can differ considerably between individuals. Aging of the crystalline lens of the human eye causes straylight to become worse.Van den Berg TJTP et al. \\"Straylight effects with aging and lens extraction\\". Am J Ophthalmol. 2007;144:358-363 Lens extraction and artificial lens implantation is an effective treatment.

It begins in the Precolumbian age of the indigenous peoples of Argentina, with the arrival of the first Spanish conqueror. European exploration Discovery of the R√≠o de la Plata by Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s. He would be attacked and killed by charr√∫as after it. When Spain and Portugal realized that the Americas were not the Indies but a new and unknown continent, they settled the portions with the Treaty of Tordesillas, dividing an eastern section of South America for Portugal and the rest for Spain. However, most of the geography of the Americas was still unknown, and many navigators sought a passage to the East Indies rather than exploring the Americas. The voyage of Ferdinand Magellan continued towards the south, passed the Strait of Magellan and eventually completed the first circumnavigation of the world. The first navigators of the Americas through unexplored territories, navigated into the wide R√≠o de la Plata expecting to find a passage to the west and reach Asia, new navigations were fostered by the rumors of silver sources (such rumors are one of the early reasons of the name of Argentina). There were land expeditions coming from the north as well, from Lima. However, the lack of precious metals in the area, and the absence of local empires like the Aztecs in Mexico or the Incas in Peru, did not allow a notable growth of the Spanish populations in the area. =Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s= The first European to disembark in what is now Argentina was Juan D√≠az de Sol√≠s, who discovered the R√≠o de la Plata. Sol√≠s was killed by Charr√∫as, along with other sailors, and his fleet returned to Spain. The sailor Francisco del Puerto, part of Sol√≠s' voyage, was spared by the Charruas because of his young age, and stayed on the Americas for some years. =Sebastian Cabot= Francisco del Puerto was rescued by the Venetian Sebastian Cabot, and told him about myths of sources of silver in the area. This promoted further explorations in the area. There was no silver, nor any other precious metal, but those initial myths influenced the modern name of Argentina. The voyage of Cabot, expecting to conquer the lands of the inexistent \\"White King\\", established the fortification of Sancti Spiritu, next to the Paran√° River. The voyage was a complete failure: they did not get any metals, Sancti Spiritu was destroyed by the native people, and the remaining Europeans returned to Europe. Colonization The Argentine area was within the Spanish colonial entities of: * Governorate of New Andalusia (1524‚àí1542) * Governorate of the R√≠o de la Plata (1549‚Äì1776), under the supervision of the Real Audiencia of Lima in the Viceroyalty of Peru (1541‚àí1661), then the first Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires (1661‚àí1671). * (1776‚Äì1814), under the governing supervision of the second Royal Audiencia of Buenos Aires (1783‚àí1810) in the south, and Real Audiencia of Charcas in the north, until the Independence of Argentina. The new ideas of the Age of Enlightenment and the events of the Peninsular War started the Argentine Wars of Independence, a theater of the greater Spanish American wars of independence.

A unit of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), led by Brendan McFarlane, launched a bombing and shooting attack on a pub on Aberdeen Street, in the loyalist Shankill area. IRA members claimed the pub was targeted because it was frequented by members of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). Four Protestant civilians and one UVF member were killed, while more than fifty were injured. According to journalists Alan Murray and Peter Taylor, it was retaliation for the Miami Showband massacre almost a fortnight earlier, when the popular Dublin-based band were shot dead by the UVF at a fake military checkpoint. McFarlane and two other IRA volunteers, Peter \\"Skeet\\" Hamilton and Seamus Clarke, were sentenced to life imprisonment for perpetrating the Bayardo attack. Background By the year 1975, the conflict in Northern Ireland, known as \\"the Troubles\\", was more than six years old. On 10 February 1975, the Provisional IRA and British government entered into a truce and restarted negotiations. The IRA agreed to halt attacks on the British security forces, and the security forces mostly ended its raids and searches.Extracts from The Longest War: Northern Ireland and the IRA by Kevin J. Kelley. Zed Books Ltd, 1988. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN) However, there were dissenters on both sides. Some Provisionals wanted no part of the truce, while British commanders resented being told to stop their operations against the IRA just when they claimed to have the IRA on the run. The security forces boosted their intelligence offensive during the truce and thoroughly infiltrated the IRA. There was a rise in sectarian killings during the truce, which 'officially' lasted until early 1976. Ulster loyalists, fearing they were about to be forsaken by the British government and forced into a united Ireland,Taylor, Peter (1999). Loyalists. London: Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. p.142 increased their attacks on Irish Catholics/nationalists. They hoped to force the IRA to retaliate and thus end the truce.Taylor, Peter. Brits: The War Against the IRA. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001. p.182 Under orders not to engage the security forces, some IRA units concentrated on tackling the loyalists. The fall-off of regular operations had caused unruliness within the IRA and some members, with or without permission from higher up, engaged in tit-for-tat killings. In the early hours of 31 July 1975 the popular Miami Showband were driving back to Dublin following a gig in Banbridge. At Buskhill (outside Newry) they were stopped at a checkpoint by Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) gunmen wearing British Army uniforms. Some of the gunmen were Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldiers. The gunmen ordered the group to line-up facing a ditch. As one gunman took the names and addresses of the band members, two others hid a bomb under the driver's seat of their minibus. However, the bomb detonated prematurely, and the two men were blown to pieces. The surviving gunmen then opened fire on the five band members, killing three and wounding two.Taylor, pp.147‚Äì149 According to journalists Peter Taylor and Alan Murray, the attack on the Bayardo was retaliation for the massacre.Taylor, p.149\\"Bayardo murders lost in rubble of McGurk's\\". Belfast Telegraph. Alan Murray. 10 March 2011 Retrieved 8 November 2011 The attack The Bayardo Bar was crowded with people of all ages on Wednesday 13 August 1975. Shortly before closing time a stolen green Audi car, containing a three- man unit of the IRA's Belfast Brigade, pulled up outside. It was driven by the unit's leader Brendan \\"Bik\\" McFarlane, a 24-year-old volunteer from Ardoyne.\\"McFarlane ‚Äì The Inside Story\\". Magill magazine. Derek Dunne. April 1986. In an unsigned statement which was read at his trial, McFarlane admitted he had driven the car used in the Bayardo attack.Bishop, Patrick Joseph & Mallie, Eamonn (1987). The Provisional IRA.

Lost Lives. UK: Mainstream. p.560 The other volunteer then entered the pub, where patrons were drinking and singing, and at the entrance he dropped a duffel bag containing a ten-pound bomb. Both men made their getaway back to the waiting car.O'Malley, Padraig (1990). Biting the Grave: the Irish hunger strikes and the politics of despair. Boston: Beacon Press. p.68 As panicked customers ran to the toilets for safety, the bomb exploded and brought down a section of the old brick-and-plaster building upon them. The bodies of civilian Joanne McDowell (29) and UVF member Hugh Harris (21) were later found beneath the rubble of fallen masonry. Seventeen-year-old civilian Linda Boyle was pulled out alive, but died of her injuries in hospital on 21 August.CAIN Web Service Sutton Index of Deaths ‚Äì 1975 Retrieved 8 November 2011. CAIN gives Linda Boyle's age as 19. Over 50 people were injured in the attack. A Belfast Telegraph article later claimed that, as the IRA unit drove away down Agnes Street (an arterial road linking the Shankill to the Crumlin Road), they fired into a crowd of women and children queuing at a taxi rank; there were no fatalities. Within 20 minutes of the blast, the IRA unit were arrested after their car was stopped at a roadblock. The Armalite that had been used to kill William Gracey and Samuel Gunning was found inside the car along with spent bullet cases and fingerprints belonging to the three IRA men. The IRA did not initially claim responsibility, However, IRA members later stated that the Bayardo was attacked because it was a pub where UVF members met and planned terrorist assaults against nationalists. The pub was in the UVF-dominated middle Shankill Road area, and the Ulster Banner was displayed from its upper windows. Martin Dillon said that the Bayardo was frequented by the UVF and that Lenny Murphy, head of the Shankill Butchers gang, was a regular customer.Dillon, Martin (1989). The Shankill Butchers: the real story of cold- blooded mass murder. New York: Routledge. p.7 Steve Bruce also maintained that in the early 1970s, the UVF's Brigade Staff (Belfast leadership) would often be found drinking in the pub, which was just around the corner from their headquarters above \\"The Eagle\\" chip shop on the Shankill Road.Bruce, Steve (1992). The Red Hand: Protestant paramilitaries in Northern Ireland. Oxford University Press. p.190 A former IRA prisoner claimed that fellow inmate Lenny Murphy told him he had left the Bayardo ten minutes before the attack and that the Brigade Staff had just finished holding a meeting there.Stevenson, Jonathan (1996). We Wrecked the Place: contemplating an end to the Northern Irish troubles. Free Press. p.54 Retaliation Loyalists, especially the UVF, responded with another wave of sectarian attacks against Catholics. Two days after, a loyalist car bomb exploded without warning on the Falls Road, injuring 35 people.Brian Hanley & Scott Millar. The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party. Chapter 8: Brothers Fighting Brothers. Penguin UK, 2010 On 22 August, the UVF launched a gun and bomb attack on McGleenan's Bar in Armagh. The attack was strikingly similar to that at Bayardo. One gunman opened fire while another planted the bomb; the explosion causing the building to collapse. Three Catholic civilians were killed (one of whom died on 28 August) and several more were wounded.McKittrick, David. Lost Lives. p.565 That same night, another bomb wrecked a Catholic-owned pub in nearby Blackwatertown, although there were no injuries.\\"Northern Ireland expects violence\\". Rome News Tribune. 24 August 1975 These loyalist attacks were responded to in kind by the IRA (sometimes using the cover name \\"Republican Action Force\\"), with the months that followed the Bayardo attack being characterised as a bloody game of tit-for-tat. This was met with disillusionment by imprisoned republicans such as Gerry Adams and Brendan Hughes, with the latter claiming that sectarianism was \\"destroying the whole struggle\\".Taylor, Peter (1998). Provos: The IRA and Sinn F√©in. London: Bloomsbury. p. 195 Convictions In May 1976, Brendan McFarlane, Seamus Clarke, and Peter Hamilton were convicted in a non-jury Diplock Court and sentenced to life imprisonment inside the Maze Prison for carrying out the Bayardo murders. Inside the Maze, McFarlane rose to become Officer Commanding IRA prisoners and in 1983 he led the Maze Prison escape, which was the mass break-out of 38 republican prisoners, including Clarke and Hamilton. McFarlane and Clarke then went on the run, although Hamilton was immediately recaptured outside the prison's main perimeter gate. McFarlane has never spoken about the killings, and the IRA leadership has never encouraged him to do so, considering the attack was viewed as having been \\"purely sectarian\\". Sinn F√©in president Gerry Adams, however, told journalist Alan Murray that McFarlane \\"hadn't a single, sectarian bone in his body\\". Peter \\"Skeet\\" Hamilton died of cancer in Dundalk on 25 February 2011 at the age of 57. The Bayardo Somme Association has described the Bayardo attack as \\"a forgotten atrocity\\". The association erected a memorial to the victims on the site where the Bayardo Bar stood before its demolition. The large steel monument was incorporated into the remaining section of the original structure; it bears the names and photographs of the five people who were killed plus photos of the pub taken before and after the bombing.CAIN Bayardo Bomb memorial See also *Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970-1979) References Category:Explosions in 1975 Category:1975 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:1975 in Northern Ireland Category:Provisional Irish Republican Army actions Category:The Troubles in Belfast Category:Mass murder in 1975 Category:Massacres in Northern Ireland Category:Deaths by firearm in Northern Ireland Category:Improvised explosive device bombings in Northern Ireland Category:History of Belfast Category:August 1975 events in the United Kingdom Category:Attacks on bars in the United Kingdom Category:Building bombings in the United Kingdom ","title":"Bayardo Bar attack"},{"id":"33677699","text":"P.Ramachandrapuram is a panchayat Village in Virudhunagar district in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

The family must then learn to adjust to the community for the weekend, until they are able to fix their car at a mechanic. However, when Meg falls in love with an Amish boy named Eli, and his father forbids the two from ever seeing each other again, a Romeo and Juliet family conflict arises between the two families. This results in a battle between the families, with the victor determining Meg and Eli's ultimate fate. The episode was written by Mark Hentemann and directed by John Holmquist.

When Peter is barred from riding The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen roller coasters because he is too overweight, he becomes disappointed. Peter's friends Joe and Quagmire then convince him to go on a diet in order to be able to ride the coaster. He is unable to lose any weight and decides to wear a girdle instead. The family then travels to Ohio in order to ride a new roller coaster called The Holocaust. This time Peter is allowed to ride the roller coaster, but it is unable to make it up the first hill, and collapses under his weight where a kid was killed from the resulting crash. The family decides to return home with Lois stating to Peter that they will have to send the family of the deceased some money.

The family approaches a group of Amish workers, asking if they can stay in the workers' village for the weekend. When Meg begins complaining about the lack of electricity and other modern conveniences, a local Amish boy named Eli decides to take her on a tour of the village. The pair then begin to exchange kisses, but the boy's overprotective, abusive, and strict father Ezekiel interrupts them, and instructs the two never to see each other again over fears that Meg may corrupt his son. Meg approaches her father about talking to Ezekiel. Peter tries to introduce Ezekiel to rock music with the song \\"Highway to Hell\\", but unintentionally turns the Amish community against him, prompting them to demand that the Griffin family leave. The Griffins explain that they cannot leave until their car is fixed, but the Amish then reveal that they have attached two horses to pull the car back to their home. Eli decides to follow Meg, and the group then returns to Quahog. Later that day, the Amish follow the family to Quahog and vandalize the Griffins' home ‚Äì painting \\"Ye Suck\\" and doing all of the outside chores ‚Äì prompting Peter to declare war against the group. A battle ensues, with both sides equally matched. Peter and Ezekiel then have a fist fight in order to settle the matter on their own, but Eli stops his father and tells him that he is truly in love with Meg.

The episode was written by executive producer and showrunner Mark Hentemann, who joined the show as a writer in its third season, writing the episode \\"The Kiss Seen Around the World\\". This was also Hentemann's second episode of the season, after first writing the Brian and Stewie adventure episode \\"Back to the Pilot\\". Series regulars Peter Shin and James Purdum served as supervising directors, with Andrew Goldberg, Alex Carter, Spencer Porter, and Elaine Ko serving as staff writers for the episode. Composer Ron Jones, who has worked on the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for \\"Amish Guy\\". \\"Amish Guy\\" was first announced at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International on July 23, 2011 by series showrunners and executive producers Steve Callaghan and Hentemann.

Recurring guest voice actors Alexandra Breckenridge, writer Chris Sheridan, writer Danny Smith, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances throughout the episode. Reception \\"Amish Guy\\" was broadcast on November 27, 2011, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by The Simpsons and Allen Gregory, and followed by Family Guy creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's second show, American Dad!.

The episode's ratings decreased significantly from the previous week's episode, \\"Thanksgiving\\". The episode received mostly positive reviews. Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club wrote of the episode, \\"The main plot actually did quite a good job of mirroring the usual Simpsons trope of starting in one place, going to another, and then taking a left turn into the actual central plot of the episode.\\" He also compared it to a comic strip, noting, \\"If I didn't think the funnies lived up to their nickname, I did what everyone does with a newspaper. I threw it away. Then I read the strip again the next day, as if the previous one hadn't existed. That's how I tried to watch this episode, paying some attention to the Griffins in Amish country, but mostly isolating each joke setup, figuring out what I liked, and then moving on to the next one.\\" He concluded his review of the episode by giving it a grade of B-. Terren R. Moore of Ology praised Peter's role in the episode, writing, \\"even though the arguments and evidence that this show is past its prime grow increasingly larger, Peter manages‚Äîfor me, anyway‚Äîto still be hilarious in nearly everything he does as he becomes more and more outlandish in the various situations the show puts him in.\\" He concluded his review, however, by stating, \\"for the most part, I arrive at the same point I do at the end of nearly every episode this season: there's just nothing new happening here.\\" Moore gave the episode a rating of 7.5 out of ten.

The episode originally aired on Fox in the United States on December 11, 2011. The episode follows Griffin family patriarch Lois Griffin's father, Carter Pewterschmidt, after he accidentally falls asleep while driving in a snowstorm. Concerned for his safety, Lois then decides to admit him to a nursing home in Florida, in an attempt to help him adjust to life as an older man. Carter is reluctant to live in the retirement community, however, but eventually comes to enjoy the various activities at the home. Six months later, Carter suddenly becomes grumpy, and even more elderly, causing Peter to take him back to his old business and bring him back to normal. The episode was written by Dave Ihlenfeld and David Wright, and directed by John Holmquist. It received mostly mixed reviews from critics for its storyline, and many cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 6.10 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by Adam Carolla, Jack Carter, D. C. Douglas, R. Lee Ermey, Christine Lakin, Joel David Moore, Linda Porter, Floyd Van Buskirk, Mae Whitman and Wally Wingert, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. Plot A snowstorm has invaded Quahog, Rhode Island, with Stewie set to visit his grandparents, Carter and Barbara Pewterschmidt at their mansion. While on the drive there, Carter falls asleep at the wheel and crashes his car into a tree. The three then go to the hospital, where Griffin family neighbor Joe Swanson alerts Carter that his driver's license has to be revoked because of Carter's old age. Barbara then suggests that the two retire. Carter is reluctant at first, since he does not want to leave a $6 billion company, but he eventually agrees to do so, admitting that he never had time to play polo or sit on a chair to moisten his mouth. Later that day, the retired Carter decides to visit his son-in-law Peter along with his friends Joe and Quagmire at the local bar to learn about their discussions of their lives at home, much to their chagrin. Carter also decides to live with the Griffin family and attempts to find someone to hang out with, including Quagmire. Peter voices his distaste of the situation, and he suggests that they put Carter and Barbara in a retirement home in Florida. The family is then able to drive to Florida and check out a retirement community. Impressed at first, Carter then refuses to live in the community, fearing that the people living there are just waiting to die, and he's even able to shout at some of them by stating \\"I'm not one of you, and I never will be!\\" Peter decides to talk to Carter on his own in an attempt to convince him to live in the home, and promises to show him how great it is to be retired. The two then perform various tasks, including playing bingo and trying out the thermostat in their room, and Carter then eventually agrees to live there. Six months later, Barbara calls the Griffin family, alerting him that something is wrong with Carter. When they arrive, they discover that he has become grumpy while also acting more tired and elderly than before. Attempting to fix him, Peter, Lois, and Barbara take him back to his old business in Quahog. Peter is able to make some proposals to Carter's secretary over the intercom by making the business more humane and having the elevator operator wear white gloves, which angers Carter so much and causing him to return to his old self. Carter then warns his wife, Peter, and Lois to never put him in a retirement home ever again, stating that he will continue running his business until the day he dies. Just then, Peter's mother Thelma calls from the nursing home on Peter's phone where she complains about her nursing home. Peter remains non-committal while also stating that nobody is touching her in her sleep and vows to visit on Thanksgiving. When Peter gets off the phone, Lois reminds him that Thelma has to stay in the home. Cultural references The title of the episode is a reference to the movie Grumpy Old Men. The scene where the drill sergeant with Alzheimer's disease is repeatedly cursing at a man he calls a \\"joker\\" is a reference to the Vietnam War movie Full Metal Jacket, which starred R. Lee Ermey. The scene where Mayor West seems to wake up from a dream, only to find that he is in another dream may be a reference to the movie Inception about false awakening. Joe Swanson's Fiona Apple tribute video is a parody of her 1997 song \\"Criminal\\". When Peter talks about him and Lois having \\"phone sax\\", a cutaway shows them playing songs on the saxophone via the phone. Peter plays \\"Baker Street\\" by Gerry Rafferty while Lois plays \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" by Paul Simon. The cut away scene where the man who was late for work, and as a result wasn't killed on 9/11, is possibly a reference to Seth MacFarlane himself. He would have been onboard one of the flights that struck the World Trade Center, had he not been late for check in. Production and development The episode was directed by series regular John Holmquist, shortly after the conclusion of the ninth production season, in his second episode of the season, the first being \\"Amish Guy\\".

He also worked on projects involving the Italian interconnecting 230 and 150 kV electricity lines, as well as making other contributions to the development of the electro-technical field.  Biography  In 1932 he planned and supervised the construction of the post office and telecommunications building in Vicenza, Italy. Soon thereafter, he focused his attention on the building of the scholastic Noventa Vicentina monument in Vicenza. In 1936, as director of the technical office of UMET in Rome, part of the Superior Council for Public Works, he developed plans for the Italian 230 and 150 kV interconnection lines with 400 MW of transferable electric power, with their respective transformation and regulation substations. Just before the outbreak of World War II, he installed the first 20,000 kVA steam-turbo generators, with automatic boilers, in Rome's thermal power station - the first of their kind. As chief engineer for energy distribution at AGEA, the Italian state electricity and water company, in 1933 he planned the construction and usage of high- and low-tension electricity lines in central and southern Italy, designed to supply electricity to the so-called \\"Agro Romano\\". Immediately after the war he was hired by the Argentine government to construct the modern thermal \\"Dean Funes\\" power station in C√≥rdoba, Argentina, which had two 2,500 kW steam-turbo generators. In 1950, as chief engineer, he planned and built the \\"9 July\\" thermal power station in Mar del Plata, the only one of its kind with a power capacity of 20,000 kW. A pipeline connecting to the YPF and subterranean water refrigeration tunnels connected to the sea complete the generator which continues to supply this seaside town today.

He supported the Parliamentary cause in the English Civil War. Elvines was possibly the son of William Elvines, a baker of Worcester, who left money for the poor of the town by his will of 2 April 1612. On the outbreak of the Civil War, Elvines took the parliamentary side but had to flee the county for opposing the commissioners of Array in 1642. He tried to recruit men to the parliamentary cause when the Earl of Essex went to Worcester but had to flee again when Sir William Russell took the city for the Royalists. He was away for four years while his whole estate was exposed to the enemy and he had to live on credit. When Worcester fell to Parliament in 1646, he became an alderman of the city and a member of the Parliamentary Committee for Worcestershire. He was persuaded to become mayor, as there was no one else they would confide in, on a faithful promise of reimbursement of all costs. However, Col. Rainsborough was called away and the Committee was dissolved so he did not receive recompense. He was added to the Committee for Sequestrations in Worcestershire on 29 July 1648, and was appointed a sub- commissioner of sequestrations for Worcestershire on 25 February 1650. W R Williams Parliamentary History of the County of Worcester When the Scottish army arrived at Worcester in 1651, Elvines had to flee for the third time, but returned with the parliamentary army. He was persuaded to become mayor again, which he described as \\"to the hazard of his life among the sick Scots\\". On 2 March 1652 the Council of State recommended the House of Commons to appoint John Coucher and Elvines, aldermen of Worcester, to be J.P.s for the city. He was appointed one of the three Sequestration Commissioners for Worcestershire on 14 December 1653, and another order of 10 January 1654 made the appointment void. In 1654, Elvines was elected Member of Parliament for Worcester in the First Protectorate Parliament. On 2 May 1654 he petitioned the Oliver Cromwell \\" to consider his great expenses and sufferings for the public, and give him an estate to live upon in his old age .. as he was now unable to serve, having hardly a subsistence.\\" The petition was referred to the Committee who reported that ¬£600 should be paid him from delinquents' estates and an ordinance was made by the Protector and his Council in September 1654 \\" for payment of ¬£6oo for his fidelity when Mayor in 1646 and when Governor in 1651, for his losses by the burning of his house, the plundering of his goods, and his expense in money.\\" References Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:English MPs 1654‚Äì1655 Category:Politicians from Worcestershire Category:People from Worcester, England Category:Mayors of places in Worcestershire Category:Place of birth unknown Category:Roundheads ","title":"Edward Elvines"},{"id":"33678021","text":"Eliseo Reyes Rodr√≠guez (1940‚Äì1967) was a Cuban guerrillero.

His grandfather Antoni (born Jeziorka, near Warsaw 1806 - died France 1857) was awarded the gold medal of the Caveliers, the Virtuti Militari for his valor during the November Uprising in 1831. Antoni studied road and bridge engineering in France, and had joined the Foreign Legion to participate during the pacification of Algeria. In 1839, Antoni Kulczewski was awarded permanent residency in France for service to his chosen homeland. Kulczewski's father, Boleslao Eugenio Kulczewski y Lester, was born in 1849 in Algeria, a French colony. He studied civil engineering and mining in Paris and came to Chile in 1872 to work as a coal mining engineer in Lota. He later became the co-founder of the Administration of Public Works. Kulczewski's mother was Luisa Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez who was born in Concepcion.  Education  Kulczewski attended at Instituto Nacional General Jos√© Miguel Carrera, a prestigious public high school of Santiago, where his Spanish teacher was Pedro Aguirre Cerda, former President of Chile from 1938 to 1941. From 1913 to 1919, Kulczewski studied architecture at the University of Chile.\\"Edificios Colectivos de la Caja del Seguro Obrero Obligatorio de Tocopilla.\\" Retru√©canos Ediciones , 2011 p132 , 9789563457285.

In this period he received three golden medals for his projects, which were exhibited at the Museo de Bellas Artes in Santiago, and in 1916, completed his first work, a house at 1854 Augustinas Avenue, Santiago.  Architectural style  Kulczewski's architectural style stems from Gothic Revival architecture, Art Nouveau, and later in his career from the emerging Modern movement. After 1939, Social consciousness became an element of his work.  Political activism  In 1931, Kulczewski and another architect, Arturo Bianchi Guandian (1897 - ), formed the Orden Socialista (the Socialist Order). On 19 April 1933, the Socialist Order attended the Chilean Socialist Convention and merged with other parties to form the Partido Socialista.Bizzarro S. \\"Historical Dictionary of Chile.\\" Scarecrow Press, 2005 p525. , 9780810865426.

Other common names for cigarette receptacle include: ash urn, ash pan, cigarette butt receptacles, butt bins, butt holders, snuffers, smokers poles, cigarette waste receptacles, smokers waste receptacles, and ash/trash combination. Originally provided as a courtesy to smokers in public places, cigarette receptacles are now commonplace as smoking bans and designated smoking areas require proper disposal methods. A typical receptacle can hold hundreds - even thousands - of disposed cigarette butts.High Volume Infinity Receptacle belson.com Retrieved 11-08-11 While the United States congress has not attempted to pass a nationwide smoking ban, many states and local governments have enacted their own statutes addressing smoking in public places.WP: U.S. Smoking Bans Cigarette litter problem Proper disposal of cigarette butts is promoted as both an environmental and health issue. It is estimated 4.5 trillion cigarette butts become litter every year. While cigarette smoking in the United States has decreased, cigarette butt litter remains the most littered item in the United States and globally. The overall littering rate for cigarette butts is 65%, and in all, tobacco products make up 38% of all roadway litter in the United States. Depending on composition, a cigarette butt can take as short as one month, and up to three years and longer to biodegrade. Cigarette filters made of cellulose acetate do eventually biodegrade, while some environmental groups claim filters containing plastic never fully biodegrade. Cigarette butts contain toxic chemicals including nicotine, cadmium and benzene.For litter estimates, see preventcigarettelitter.org and WP: Cigarette. Types Cigarette receptacles for use in public and private establishments can be wall-mounted or free-standing, for indoor and outdoor use. Construction materials include metal (steel, stainless steel, aluminum), concrete, stone/epoxy aggregate, various plastics (polyethylene, recycled plastic), and fiberglass, with receptacles made of one material or a combination of several. =Ash urns= Concrete cigarette ash urn Ash urns are usually mounted on a pedestal, and present a media such as sand or gravel for a smoker to snuff cigarette butts. This type of cigarette receptacle is also common in ash/trash combination units, with the urn placed on top of a trash bin below. =Wall mounted cigarette receptacles= Wall mounted cigarette receptacles are manufactured in a variety of shapes, sizes and butt disposal methods. Units with all-metal construction allow disposing of cigarette butts into a container with no other extinguishing media required. Some receptacles utilize a separate butt container for clean-out, while one-piece models simply dump used butts. =Tube cigarette receptacles= Tubular cigarette receptacles can be wall-mounted or free standing, of various lengths and diameters. Their simple design allows butts to be deposited directly into the tube, and to extinguish on their own. Usually constructed of metal, no other media, such as sand or water, is required. One and two-piece construction is common. =Free standing cigarette receptacles= Free standing plastic cigarette receptacle Made in a variety of configurations and construction materials, free standing cigarette receptacles come in heavy pre-cast concrete, lighter weight stone/epoxy aggregate and lighter still materials such as polyethylene, recycled plastic and fiberglass. Many free standing cigarette receptacles utilize an oxygen restricting design that extinguishes still burning butts. These style receptacles are usually made of molded plastic, polyethylene and fiberglass, with metal inner liners and metal pails to gather disposed butts.Ultra SomkeStop receptacle belson.com, Retrieved 11-10-11. Due to their oxygen depriving design, no additional extinguishing media is generally required. Cigarette butts are deposited through a small opening and drop down a long neck into the collection chamber. The collection chamber typically houses the removable pail. Free standing concrete cigarette receptacle Other free standing receptacles, such as those made of pre-cast concrete and stone aggregate materials, rely on water, sand or gravel placed in the collection bin to assist in extinguishing disposed butts. Butt removal and clean-out is accomplished through a door in the receptacle's base, or, the base and top separate to allow access to disposed butts. Free standing plastic cigarette receptacle Cigarette tree Enhanced design features Some cigarette receptacles contain unique design features at the butt entry point. These include: *limited entry designs, to discourage unwanted trash *covered openings to eliminate rainwater overflow *large snuffer plates for better hygiene and an easier target *recessed snuffer screens to prevent ashes from falling to the ground. Theme cigarette receptacles Cigarette receptacles made of molded materials are often designed to match their surroundings. Sports themes such as receptacles decorated with golf balls and baseballs are common; other examples include nautical receptacles designed to look like buoys, receptacles resembling trees, and receptacles mimicking an architectural style. Accessories Various size metal pails provide easy butt collection and removal. For receptacles with collection pails, odor- absorbing and fire suppressing filters, placed inside the pails, use baking soda for odor control and also release CO2 for fire suppression. Weighted bases assist free standing receptacles to remain steady in inclement weather. In areas where security is a concern, tie-downs, security cables and locks keep the cigarette receptacle safe from theft and vandalism.

The day of Purnima is the day (Tithi) in each month when the full moon occurs, and marks the division in each month between the two lunar fortnights (paksha), and the Moon is aligned exactly in a straight line, called a syzygy, with the Sun and Earth. Full moon is considered the third of the four primary phases of the Moon; the other three phases are new moon, first quarter moon, and third quarter moon. The full moon shows 100% illumination, causes high tides, and can concur with lunar eclipses. Festivals The following festivals occur on Purnima. * Kartik Poornima, is celebrated on the full moon day of Kartik. It is also called Tripura Purnima. * Shravan Poornima, is the full moon day in Shravan. This day has a number of different names. Hayagriva Jayanti is also celebrated on Shravana Purnima. It is also known as Narali Purnima * Vat Purnima is celebrated on the full moon day of the month of Jyeshta. Women pray for their husbands by tying threads around a banyan tree (Vat) on this day. It honors Savitri, the legendary wife of Satyavan who escaped death for her husband's life. It is the chosen day for worshipping Yama deva * Guru Purnima, devotees offer puja (worship) to their Guru, on the full moon day of Ashadha.

He was a fellow member of the Academy of Arts of Mexico, of the National Seminary of Mexican Culture and the music director of the National Institute of Fine Arts. Life Enr√≠quez was born in Ocotl√°n, Jalisco, and studied composition with Miguel Bernal Jim√©nez in Mexico. A scholarship from the Instituto Mexico-Norteamericano of Guadalajara enabled him to continue his education at the Juilliard School in New York, where he studied violin with Ivan Galamian, chamber music with Louis Persinger, and composition with Peter Mennin and Stefan Wolpe, from whom he learned about serial techniques. From the 1960s through the 1980s he had a meteoric career as a violinist, composer, and music administrator. Starting in the 1960s he was most prominent representative of the avant-garde in Mexico (; ). In 1954 Enr√≠quez debuted as a soloist in his own Concerto No. 1 for violin and orchestra, performed in Teatro Degollado in Guadalajara under the direction of Eisenberg. Continuing his studies at the Mexican-American Institute of Guadalajara, he received a scholarship to transfer to New York (1955). By the end of 1958 he traveled to Mexico City became a violinist and assistant director of chorus of Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Nacional de M√©xico. Compositional style Enr√≠quez's early works, starting with the Suite for Violin and Piano in 1949 through the First String Quartet (1959) were in the nationalist neoclassism widespread in Mexico at that time, featuring folk-like tunes in dissonant harmonies and with propulsive rhythms including frequent syncopation and hemiola. In the early 1960s he adopted a loose form of twelve-tone technique, combined with minimalist designs. Characteristic examples are his Second Symphony (1962) and Pentam√∫sica for wind quintet (1963). In later works, such as Transici√≥n for orchestra (1965), the Second String Quartet and Ambivalencia for violin and cello (both 1967), and D√≠ptico I for flute and piano (1969) he began to experiment with aleatory procedures and graphic notation. Aleatory, contrapuntal, and soloistic passages alternating with long timbral blocks are characteristic of his music though the 1960s and 70s, while his last works returned to strong, lyrical melodies, as in the Fourth String Quartet (1983), and finally to a recasting of his earlier nationalist style within freer, contrasting structures, as in his Fifth String Quartet (1988) .

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Antennaria parvifolia generally grows a few centimeters high but it may reach 15 centimeters. The grayish, woolly-haired leaves are up to 3.5 centimeters long, the upper ones shorter and narrower than the basal. The inflorescence contains 2 to 7 flower heads. The plant may be gynoecious, containing only female flowers, or dioecious, with some female plants and some male in a given population. Dioecious plants are most common in Colorado and New Mexico, and can reproduce sexually, though male plants are much less common than female. Plants in most other areas are mostly gynoecious, reproducing asexually via apomixis. The plant forms mats by spreading stolons and sprouting new stems. The flower heads are lined with an outer layer of phyllaries which are variable in color from white to red, green, or brown. The fruit is an achene with a pappus that helps it disperse on the wind. In Colorado Antennaria parvifoliais an indicator of overgrazing and increases in frequency on heavily grazed land. It grows in disturbed habitat and a wide variety of ecosystems and soil types.

It is located next to and conjoined with the Metro San L√°zaro station, in the Venustiano Carranza borough in the eastern part of Mexico City. Designed by architect Juan Jos√© Diaz Infante N√∫√±ez, it is marked by its very large dome covering the structure. The outer rim of the circular interior contains ticket counters and boarding areas for bus lines. The center contains a food court and other businesses. The terminal serves travelers to fourteen states in the country, primarily to the east and south of Mexico City, such as to Puebla, Veracruz, Oaxaca and the Yucatan Peninsula. There are nine bus companies that operate from here with the four main companies being Estrella Roja, Autotransportes Texcoco, Autobuses de Oriente (ADO) and Grupo Texcoco. There over four hundred busses operating seventeen routes, with carry an average of 10,000 passengers per day. The terminal gets crowded during vacation periods and long holiday weekends. During these weekends, traveler totals are ten percent or more above normal. The busiest times are the Christmas and Holy Week periods, which can see anywhere from 180,000 to 220,000 passengers go through the terminal. The terminal was built in 1978 by the federal government under Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo. In 2003, there were renovations including the pedestrian bridges, a tunnel for taxis, restructuring the main local bus stop, installation of street lighting and the banning of vendors. Crime has been an issue at the terminal. One reason for the problems is the rise in crime in the surrounding neighborhoods in general. Another has been the operation of unlicensed taxis although much of this has been relieved by the construction of an underground station for legal taxis. One particular problem at least since the 2000s has been the prostitution of children. Girls and young women as young as ten years old from poor parts of the country are targeted as they arrive to Mexico City. The terminal has over 2,000 security workers during peak times with twenty security cameras. In 2011, some of government efforts to encourage reading were centered on the terminal.

As reported by a recent experiment, \\"resemblance to the subject's own face raised the incidence of trusting a partner\\". When similarities in appearance are distinguished, trust tends to be established. Experiment The facial resemblance experiment utilized digital morphing technology to manipulate and combine the faces of persons unknown to the subject with either the subject's own face or another stranger's face. These faces were used in a \\"trust game\\" during which the subject would initially determine how much he or she trusts another individual by the face displayed on a screen, and then give some of the money allotted to him or her by the experimenters to the person on the screen. The subjects were told that the money given to the partner would be tripled, and then the receiving partner would decide how much money to return (though in reality no second partner existed). Subjects were shown the computer generated faces, which were described as \\"playing partners from different universities\\", and they were asked to give some of their money to the faces shown to them. How much money a subject offers determines his or her trust in the face presented: more money given means more trust in the partner, while less money given means less trust in the partner. The subjects were asked to act as the receiver of money for several rounds to ensure realism. Prosocial behavior Facial resemblance does not only enhance trustworthiness, but also increases the chance of prosocial behavior. One theory is that this prosocial behavior occurs because facial resemblance is a potential cue of kinship. If someone identifies similarities of him/herself in another individual, the tendency to trust is higher. Attractiveness  Because of the correlation between facial recognition and trustworthiness, further experiments have been conducted to determine if facial resemblance also applies to other social interactions outside of fidelity. One experiment measured the relationship between facial resemblance and attractiveness. The results conclude, \\"Though an individual may be viewed as more trustworthy, the effects of resemblance on attractiveness are lower.\\" Facial resemblance had no effect on the attractiveness for a long-term relationship with a person. It did however, affect attractiveness for a short-term relationship.

The firm started trading in 1927 and operated independently until being bought by Ekco in 1955. The rights to the Dynatron name are currently held by Roberts Radio. Dynatron was also a successful business with making record players; most of them were made in the sixties and seventies. Priced in the pro-sumer market sector, the average household would have had to save the equivalent of three weeks salary to buy one. Early history The Hacker brothers, Ron (born 1908) and Arthur (born 1910), shared a strong interest in radio, and started a company producing high quality radiograms and wireless receivers at the ages of just 19 and 17 respectively. As they were too young to become directors of a company, the firm was set up using their father's name, Harry Hacker, in 1927. The firm began in a room above the family grocery shop on Maidenhead High Street, and the first product emerged in 1928 - the Dynatron U53 radiogram. A factory was built in the large rear garden of the family house \\"Little Gables\\" in Ray Lea Road in Maidenhead, measuring just 50 by 25 feet initially, but extended several times. In 1936, the company name was changed to Dynatron Radio Ltd. The Hacker brothers always pursued the highest possible technical quality, and released designs incorporating many valves at a time when their competitors concentrated on reducing the number of valves in their products. For many years, they persisted with TRF principle, only adopting superhet designs after some 10 years of development. World War II During the Second World War, Dynatron contributed to the war effort on a not for profit basis, expanding the work force from around 70 employees to 160. The operation continued from the family home and expanded into a requisitioned factory, amounting to around 15,000 square feet of space. They produced airborne guidance systems such as Gee for the RAF, and after the war, Ron Hacker was awarded the M.B.E., though this was accepted with some reluctance as he felt that his brother also deserved the recognition. Post war period After the war, austerity measures and component shortages caused the company significant difficulties. The Dynatron range had always been aimed at the top of the market, but achieving this in post-war times was always going to be problematic. In 1954, an offer from Ekco was accepted, and control was handed over in 1955. At the time, there were 150 employees, and a new factory in St. Peter's Road had just been built. The Hacker brothers were retained as joint Managing Directors, and the company was successful; by 1959 there were 250 employees. However, the brothers decided to leave the group in September 1959 to start Hacker Radio Ltd. Shortly afterwards in 1960, Ekco merged with Pye, and then Pye was bought by Philips in 1967. During this time, Dynatron was moved from Maidenhead to King's Lynn. In 1981, Philips sold Dynatron to Roberts Radio. During the 1980s, Roberts, a company already marketing portable radios at the premium end of the market sector, used the Dynatron brand for lower-end portable radios and clock- radios. This tactic was needed in order to prevent Dynatron and Roberts products from competing against each other in the same market sector, but unfortunately it also very much cheapened the image of the brand. Roberts manufactured the last Dynatron-branded radios in the late 1980s. Since then the brand has been in a state of permanent hiatus.

Common names include red fruit bearberry, alpine bearberry, arctic bearberry, red manzanita, and ravenberry. It is native to Eurasia and northern North America from Alaska through most of Canada to Greenland.Fryer, Janet L. (2008). Arctostaphylos rubra. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory. Retrieved 11-11-2011. There is also one population in the contiguous United States, located in the Absaroka Mountains of Wyoming.Arctostaphylos rubra. The Nature Conservancy. Retrieved 11-11-2011.  Description  This plant is a low, spreading shrub growing up to tall. The leaves are long and marcescent, remaining on the shrub as they die. The inflorescence is a hairy, glandular raceme of up to 6 flowers, each about half a centimeter long. The fruit is a drupe. The plant reproduces by seed and by sprouting from stolons and underground rhizomes.  Distribution and habitat  This shrub is a member of many plant communities in Arctic and alpine climates. It occurs in subalpine forests and tundra. It is a common member of forest ecosystems dominated by spruces such as white spruce and black spruce. It may be a dominant species in several types of habitat, including balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera ssp. balsamifera) floodplains and tundra shrublands in Alaska. It is dominant or co-dominant with Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii) and cup lichen (Cladonia cariosa and C. pyxidata) in Jasper National Park; white spruce and mountain alder (Alnus viridis ssp. crispa) in the Mackenzie Delta; and white spruce along the Alaska Highway in Yukon. In the lower latitudes the plant grows at higher elevations, especially near the timberline. Its maximum latitude and elevation is thought to be increasing due to climate change. This shrub grows on low-nutrient soils in cold regions, often soils that overlie permafrost. It is most common in moist areas, such as the shores of lakes and bays, riverbanks, bogs, and wet forest floors. It is often a pioneer species in the primary phase of ecological succession, taking hold in areas cleared of vegetation such as floodplains, bare tundra, cleared spots on taiga, and newly formed dunes. It grows along the scoured edges of receding glaciers and in old bulldozer tracks. Clearing events such as floods, oil spills, and wildfire may increase the abundance of the species.  Ecology  Many animals feed on the fruits, including mammals such as polar bears and other bears, meadow voles, red-backed voles, western heather voles, Dall's sheep, and sometimes caribou and hoary marmots. It is food for birds such as Ravens. It is a good plant to use for revegetation efforts on wet, disturbed habitat in subalpine and boreal regions.  Uses  The fruit is edible for humans but is not a favored food. It has been utilized by the Gwich'in people and the Inuit.Arctostaphylos rubra. Ethnobotany, University of Michigan.

It was founded by the Yuan prince Gunashiri, a descendant of Chagatai Khan, in the late 14th century (c.1389), and ruled by the Chagatayids thereafter until 1463. From 1380, it began to tribute to Ming dynasty. From 1406, it was governed by Ming under the Kara Del Guard (), however sometimes it was still under the influence of Northern Yuan, and the ruler was called the Obedient King () under the Jimi system. It was destroyed as a result of the wars between Ming China and Oirat Mongols and dynastic succession struggles in 1513. Kara Del means \\"Black chest\\" in the Mongolian language. History In 1389, the Buddhist Chagataid prince Gunashiri broke away from the Northern Yuan dynasty, which had fallen under the reign of Jorightu Khan Yes√ºder, an Arig-Bokid prince. He established himself in Hami by 1390 and ruled over a Uyghur population.Ed. Reuven Amitai-Preiss, Reuven Amitai, David Morgan-The Mongol empire and its legacy, p.294 In 1404, Gunashiri's successor Engke Temiir accepted the establishment of a Ming guard and became Hami Prefecture. However the Ming did not directly govern Hami or collect taxes. Engke Temiir was granted the title Zhongshunwang (meaning the obedient prince) by the Ming court.Kim 2008, p. 68. During the 1430s, Kara Del submitted to the Oirats. The Uyghurs of Hami came into regular contact with Mongols in southwestern Inner Mongolia. Several Uyghur chiefs became major leaders of the western Mongols, leading to the spread of Uyghurjin as a clan name in the Ordos area. In 1463 the khan was overthrown by a pro-Mongol faction and a serious succession crisis ensued. From 1467, the Ming emperors repeatedly reinstalled members of Gunashiri's house but the situation in Hami never stabilized. Hami was conquered by Mansur Khan, the ruler of Moghulistan in 1513. Kara Del officially converted to Islam in 1513. It was reported that between Khitay and Khotan the Sarigh Uyghur tribes who were \\"impious\\" resided, and they were targeted for ghazat (holy war) by Mansur Khan following 1516. After the islamization of Kara Del, Uyghur fell into disuse until the 20th century, except as a local term for Muslim Turks in Hami and Turpan. In 1923, Uyghur was revived again as a general designation for Xinjiang's Tarim Basin oasis dwellers. Culture Buddhism survived in Uyghurstan (Turfan and Qocho) during the Ming dynasty.

Bloomsbury Institute is a for-profit higher education provider in central London. offering undergraduate and postgraduate degree courses in business management, accountancy, and law, validated by the University of Northampton. The institute was founded in 2002 as the London School of Business and Management and adopted its current name in 2018. In July 2019, in a decision later overturned by the courts, the Bloomsbury Institute became the first institution to be refused permission by the Office for Students (OfS) to be included on the register of providers. The Office for Students claimed Bloomsbury did not meet the requirements for quality (specifically the continuation rate from first to second year and the rate of progression to graduate employment) or for management and governance (specifically the student outcome data and \\"a lack of credibility in its student and financial forecasts\\"). Following an initial judicial review, the OfS's decision was ruled lawful in March 2020, but in August 2020 the Court of Appeal overturned the initial decision and ordered the Office for Students to reconsider Bloomsbury's application for registration. In 2019 Bloomsbury Institute partnered with Unlock to join the 'Ban the Box' campaign, becoming the first higher education provider in the UK to no longer ask anyone wishing to study or work at the institute to disclose past criminal convictions. Prior to 2016, Bloomsbury Institute concentrated an delivering HND programmes, awarded by Pearson Education, after which it shifted to primarily offering degrees validated by the University of Northampton. The last recruitment onto HND courses was in September 2015 and the first recruitment onto the new BA courses was in January 2016. Bloomsbury Institute is regularly reviewed by the Quality Assurance Agency. The last full review, in October 2015, noted that there had been a change of validator for degree programmes from the University of South Wales and Cardiff Metropolitan University to the University of Northampton. The review found that the institute met UK expectations for the maintenance of academics standards, for the quality of student learning opportunities and for the quality of information about learning opportunities, and commended the institute for its enhancement of student learning opportunities. A monitoring visit in 2016 find that all recommendations of the 2015 report had been implemented in full. It also noted that the new admissions policy in place from February 2016 was \\"underpinned by a commitment to fair access\\", and that 65% of students were from black and ethnic minorities background and 20% declared a disability.

She is portrayed by Madeleine Stowe.Victoria Grayson Played by Madeleine Stowe Stowe's portrayal of the character has received critical praise. She has been nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress ‚Äì Television Series Drama. Personality Victoria Grayson, considered by many Hamptonites as \\"the Queen of the Hamptons,\\" with a net worth of $1 billion, is the glamorous and powerful matriarch of the Grayson family. Beneath her glamorous public face, however, she is a cold, ruthless manipulator and murderer who will stop at nothing to protect her social status, and who will eliminate anyone who gets in her way. Early Life Victoria was born to wealthy parents Maxwell and Marion Harper. Maxwell walked out on his family, leaving Marion to raise their child alone and penniless. Marion killed her subsequent boyfriend Thomas, and manipulated the 15-year-old Victoria into taking the blame, claiming self-defense. Victoria then spent the next several months in a mental hospital. Upon getting out, Victoria unknowingly reconnected with her father, who she believed to be another one of her mother's boyfriends, and was manipulated by him into an incestuous relationship. When she tried to end it, he sexually assaulted her. Marion blamed her for her own rape, and threw her out of the house. To stay off the street, Victoria became friends with a man named Jimmy Brennan, who eventually raped her and got her pregnant. She gave birth to a son, Patrick, whom she gave up for adoption when she was accepted into a prestigious school in Paris. There, she began a relationship with a man named Pascal LeMarchal, who ended up cheating on her. Upon returning to the U.S., she ran an art forgery scam with her boyfriend Dominik, yet soon abandoned him to seduce the wealthy Conrad Grayson. Conrad was married to his wife Stevie at the time, who was struggling with alcoholism. While Stevie was in rehab, Victoria faked a pregnancy to pressure Conrad into divorcing his wife and marrying her. Although she succeeded in obtaining a life of wealth and status, Victoria's marriage to Conrad was a loveless one. However in spite of this, their son Daniel was the highlight of Victoria's life. She fell in love with her neighbor David Clarke, who worked for Conrad's company Grayson Global and had a daughter of his own named Amanda. Fearing that Conrad would find out about her affair with David and leave her with nothing, Victoria framed David for money laundering in connection with a terrorist attack that brought down Flight 197, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of passengers. David was sentenced to life in prison, while Amanda was sent to the foster care system. Victoria, all the while, payed off her and Conrad's conspirators to ensure Amanda would remain locked up until the age of 21. Shortly after, Victoria realized she was pregnant with David's child, so she lured Conrad into bed to make him believe that the child was his. She named the baby girl Charlotte after David's favorite aunt. Years later, Amanda dedicates herself to avenging her family; to that end, she reinvents herself as Emily Thorne and embarks upon an intricate scheme to ruin Victoria's life. Overview Conrad Grayson, Victoria's husband, hints that she comes from a working-class background. She faked her pregnancy to get the wealthy Conrad to marry her. Several flashbacks and conversations reveal that she had an affair with David Clarke, the man that she and her husband framed for a plane crash. After David Clarke was convicted, Victoria went to prosecutor Kingsley to admit her role in his framing. Conrad stopped her. He promised Kingsley unbridled political support. Another flashback reveals that she was responsible for having Amanda Clarke institutionalized by promising the court-appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Michelle Banks, her own private practice with a steady stream of wealthy clients. =Season 1= In the episode \\"Pilot\\" Victoria learns of Conrad's affair with her best friend, Lydia Davis. Emily Thorne tampers with Conrad's room service meal at the South Fork Inn, where Conrad and Lydia secretly chose to meet. After having a sexual affair with Lydia and eating soup, Conrad has stomach pains and is in need of emergency medical attention. Victoria rushes to the hospital thinking that Conrad is in a serious condition. Victoria then notices a South Fork Inn robe in the hospital bed and fiercely says, \\"Don't do it again\\" to her husband. Emily mentions seeing Lydia outside the South Fork Inn and helps Victoria realize that Lydia is sleeping with Conrad. Victoria makes a beautiful speech and tells the crowd that Lydia has won the art auction. However, Victoria sends Lydia home with the Van Gogh \\"as a reminder of the friendship they shared.\\" In the episode \\"Trust\\" Victoria begins to suspect that Emily is not who she says she is. Victoria asks Frank Stevens to find information about Emily's past, in order to protect her son Daniel. In the episode \\"Betrayal\\" the Grayson family goes to Senator Tom Kingsley. Victoria remembers when she was in love with David Clarke and the fact that he would be convicted. She revealed evidence to Kingsley exonerating David, however, Kingsley had ignored it when Conrad offered to support his political ambitions. In the present, during dinner with Victoria, Conrad, his wife, and a staffer, Kingsley receives two video e-mails showing him with his now-former mistress, Erin, whom he had given money for an abortion. Victoria throws a fundraiser for him and a still-pregnant Erin, appears smiling happily. The political speech on his computer tablet becomes an announcement of his retirement from public life. In the episode \\"Duplicity\\" Emily's next victim is Dr. Michelle Banks, a psychologist who kept her at a mental hospital.

In the episode \\"Guilt\\" Victoria gets upset when she learns that Conrad is helping Lydia. Lydia returns to the Hamptons hoping to expose Emily and get her life back. Later Victoria is seated next to a woman who lost her family in the plane crash. She learns that Lydia's introduction speech will expose the Graysons' involvement in the plane crash. To prevent this from happening, Victoria comes to Lydia and says nice things so Lydia won't do it and she doesn't expose any of Victoria's crimes.

Huntley has some conditions for his new client, such as financial transparency and Victoria's full support to do whatever is necessary to take Conrad down.

She then finds out that Conrad took Lydia away. In the episode \\"Duress\\" Victoria is upset that Daniel wants something small for his birthday. During the divorce settlement meeting, Victoria's lawyer points out that because she was pregnant when she signed the pre-nup, Victoria had the right to take 50 percent of Conrad's earnings.

Emily sees an interview where her father stated that Victoria's then-newborn daughter, Charlotte, may be his, as a result of their affair, and her half-sister. In the episode \\"Infamy\\" Emily sends an anonymous tape of David to Conrad that reveals Charlotte as David's daughter. Realizing she's cornered, Victoria invites Amanda over to confirm she was the one who sent the tape and to get proof that she is who she claims to be. She later sends somebody to get the rest of the tapes from Amanda's bedroom that Emily had planted there. Victoria is shocked and upset when Daniel proposes to Emily and she accepts, but decides to be supportive, so Daniel will be able to gain access to his trust fund and control of Grayson Global. When Huntley makes it clear he is unsure if he can trust her anymore, Victoria fires him. She also tells Daniel the truth about Charlotte but insinuates the pregnancy was forced by David Clarke.

The episode revolves around the relationship between Kevin Arnold and his math teacher, Mr. Collins, who pushes him to succeed in math. Kevin becomes antagonistic towards Mr. Collins, only to become regretful when tragedy befalls the teacher. The episode was well received by the critical community at the time. It has been retrospectively considered a classic episode of the series. Bob Brush won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for his work on scripting this episode. Michael Dinner won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series, becoming one of the few episodes to accomplish the directing/writing double. Plot Kevin Arnold (Fred Savage) is averaging a \\"respectable\\" C in Mr. Collins' math class. Despite his best efforts, Kevin can only muster average 'C' grades. Kevin is mostly content with this, particularly after he does pull off a 'B' on a recent test, reasoning to himself that he is trying his best. However, Kevin becomes curious when he sees that Paul received a note from Mr. Collins on his math paper which read, \\"Good job, Paul.\\" Kevin stops to talk with Mr. Collins regarding his progress in the class, expecting Collins to be impressed with his grades. When Mr. Collins doesn't reciprocate Kevin's enthusiasm for his grades, Kevin begins to wonder why. Kevin stops Mr. Collins in the courtyard and the teacher explains that he does not believe Kevin is achieving his potential in the class, and could achieve an 'A' on his upcoming midterm, if he really tried. Mr. Collins begins to personally tutor Kevin, and the two develop a unique bond in the class. After many tutoring sessions in preparation for the midterm, one afternoon, Mr. Collins suddenly tells Kevin that he would not be able to help Kevin with his math for the rest of the week because he would be away, but would be back for the midterm at the end of the week. Kevin does not take this well, saying, \\"I thought you were my friend,\\" to which Collins replies \\"I am not your friend Mr. Arnold - I am your teacher\\". Mr. Collins, after being away a few days does show up for the midterm and Kevin, feeling betrayed, purposefully flunks the midterm examination, writing \\"who cares\\" and \\"???\\" in response to the questions, which disturbed Mr. Collins greatly. Kevin drops his test off and rushes out of the class, while Mr. Collins, looking over the paper, calls out \\"Kevin!\\", which Kevin ignores. Although Kevin is proud of himself that evening, as the weekend progresses, Kevin regrets his decision to flunk the test. Kevin returns on Monday, and asks to see Mr. Collins in the teachers' lounge to apologize for his behavior. Mr. DiPerna surprises Kevin at the door and pulls him aside, explaining that Mr. Collins had died over the weekend from a heart condition, something he was suffering from for a long time. Mr. DiPerna apologizes for telling Kevin this news prior to a school-wide announcement, and informs Kevin that he will be taking over the class for now until a teacher could be found. Kevin is distraught at this news, and sincerely regrets his decision to scorn Mr. Collins in such a way. Later, Kevin and Paul are eating lunch in the cafeteria when one of Kevin's friends pokes fun at Kevin and Paul over a score that Paul received on a math quiz in an advanced math class, which was taught by a female teacher. Kevin flicks Jell-O on the friend but is caught by Mr. DiPerna, who asks to see Kevin after school. After school, Mr. DiPerna informs Kevin that Mr. Collins had \\"lost\\" his exam and asks if Kevin has any ideas what to do about it. Kevin says he doesn't have any ideas, to which Mr. DiPerna responds, \\"Well, Mr. Collins did,\\" and reveals a blank test paper that Collins wrote 'Kevin Arnold' at the top of it. Kevin realizes that Mr. Collins had posthumously given him a second chance to prove himself, and sees this as his opportunity to make amends with him. Kevin proceeds to ace the exam, telling DiPerna, \\"You don't have to grade it, it's an A.\\" As Kevin leaves the classroom, he looks back at Mr. Collins' old desk, and sees a vision of his late former teacher in the chair with a look of approval on his face, and says out loud, \\"Good job, Mr. Collins.\\" The camera dims as Kevin walks out of the building and a black and white photo of Mr. Collins in the yearbook with the words 'IN MEMORIAM Arthur A. Collins 1919-1970' are shown as the closing music plays. Production Showrunner and writer Bob Brush said, \\"When we first came up with the idea of doing the math teacher, there was the premise of a three part arc from the beginning that I wanted to do. I loved the episode, because I thought the whole arc was very poignantly about becoming a man and accepting the keys and responsibility to manhood from the teacher and the master. It was really a rite of manhood, so it was a personal story.\\" Brush also praised the performances of Fred Savage and Steven Gilborn, saying, \\"I was as pleased as I'll ever get with that episode. It certainly meant a lot for me. It had to do with a lot of parts of my own life. The thing that I was probably proudest of about the episode was that in the long run, it was not specifically a weeper, which I never wanted it to be. I thought there was a strength in it. I thought at the end of the episode, where Kevin Arnold walks down the hallway, there was a manliness to him, which I had wanted to accomplish. I wanted an episode where he accepted being a man.\\" Director Michael Dinner said the episode dealt with death, but was about \\"growing up and realizing his own failings.\\" Reception =Critical reception= The Los Angeles Times named it the fifth greatest comedy episode about death. =Accolades= Michael Dinner won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series and Bob Brush won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series at the 42nd Primetime Emmy Awards. The episode also earned Brush a Humanitas Prize at the 17th annual awards in the category of 30 Minute Network or Syndicated Television and a nomination for the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Screenplay - Episodic Comedy at the 1990 Writers Guild of America Awards. The episode also earned an Emmy nomination in the category of Outstanding Editing for a Series - Single Camera Production for Michael Vejar and an American Cinema Editors Eddie Award nomination in the category of Best Edited Episode from a Television Series for Dennis C. Vejar. Fred Savage was nominated for his second consecutive Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series for this episode.

It is likely that the first house on the site was built in wood, and later replaced in stone. It is possible the house built in 1314 for Robert de Holland was on this site. The oldest fabric in the present house dates from the 1550s: In the entrance hall is a massive stone fireplace of that date. =Current building= The building was constructed around 1625, re-using structural timbers and possibly on an earlier foundation. By 1639 the house was owned by Thomas Covell, Mayor of Lancaster, and Keeper of Lancaster Castle. That building has been called the \\"Old Hall\\" of Lancaster. p.436 For many years the house was used as lodgings by visiting judges attending the Assizes court at Lancaster Castle. There is evidence that the house was used for this purpose as early as 1635. Lancaster was severely damaged by Royalist forces in 1643 during the Civil War. Around 1662 the property was bought by Thomas Cole, Deputy Lieutenant of Lancashire. The building was extended and altered in 1675, and the new building was called \\"New Hall\\". The house was sold in 1826 to the county magistrates. Following this an extension was added to the side of the building, and other alterations were made. Use of the house by visiting judges ended in 1975, and the building was converted into a museum. This includes a Museum of Childhood, and a collection of furniture made by the Lancaster firm of Gillows (later Waring & Gillow). =Closure in 2016= Due to cuts to local council budgets by the Cameron government, in November 2015 Lancashire County CouncilLCC Press release PR15/0516 proposed withdrawing all funding for five museums across Lancashire: the Judges' Lodgings, Fleetwood Museum, Helmshore Mills Textile Museum, Museum of Lancashire and Queen Street Mill. The leader of the council spoke of \\"the financial challenges facing the county council as we deal with relentless cuts to central government funding combined with rising demand for our services\\". Despite letters of protest and an on-line petition the council confirmed their decision at a meetingLCC documents in February 2016 and the Judges' Lodgings was told it would close its doors for the last time on 31 March. A group of concerned citizens formed a \\"Friends of the Judges' Lodgings\\"Friends of the Judges' Lodgings in the hopes of finding a way to allow the museum to continue. In March 2016 the closure of all five museums was deferred until September 2016.Jordison, Sam. The museum closed on 30 September 2016, along with the other four Lancashire museums mentioned above, except for pre-booked school groups. Lancashire County Council's website states that \\"Negotiations are underway with a potential new operator and it is hoped they will be finalised in Autumn 2017.\\" In April 2018 Lancashire County Council announced it would be reopening the museum, alongside Queen Street Mill and Helmshore Textile Mills, to the general public for three days a week over the summers of 2018 and 2019 while talks continued about their futures.http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/news/details/?Id=PR18/0180 =2019 and 2020= Inhttp://www.lancasterjudgeslodgings.org.uk March 2019 Lancaster Judges' Lodgings reopened staffed by a mixture of paid staff and volunteers. The first season after the reopening saw many visitors both coming from out of town and local residents keen to see the museum open once again. There was a busy programme of events put on by the museum and the Friends which ensured that Judges' Lodgings had a very successful reopening season. However, many of the events planned for 2020 were put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the opening was delayed until the end of August 2020. It was announced that the Judges' Lodgings would re-open on 28 August 2020, for pre-booked visits only. Architecture The building is constructed in sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings and slate roofs. It has a U-shaped plan. The entrance front faces west, is symmetrical, has three storeys and a basement, and is in seven bays. The architectural style is Georgian. The doorcase has Tuscan columns supporting blocks carved with lions' heads, a triglyph frieze containing flowers, and an open segmental pediment containing a painting of the arms of Lancashire. Collections =Gillows Furniture collection= Regency English billiards table by Gillows at Judges' Lodgings. The building houses an extensive collection of Gillows furniture, which is partly displayed in the context of a museum of the firm and partly in rooms furnished in period style. Robert Gillow (1704-1772) started making furniture around 1727, predating Thomas Chippendale by twenty years. He made furniture for the upper middle classes and landed gentry. Robert was succeeded by his sons: Richard managed the Lancaster production, and Robert set up a London operation. As a provincial he was unique in having a London showroom. It was a family business until 1813, when the Gillow family sold the firm to three partners, Redmayne, Whiteside, and Ferguson, who retained the name Gillow & Co. Gillows furniture is referred to by Jane Austen, Thackeray and the first Lord Lytton, and in one of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas. Much of the furniture in the Judges' Lodging was commissioned by specific clients. The firm's Estimate Sketch Books are preserved in Westminster City Archives. They constructed furniture to their own design and nurtured their own designers but equally they would construct furniture for designers without production capacity. They did work for Chippendale, Sheraton and Hepplewhite. In the 1760s Gillows began producing billiard tables. Accessed via JSTOR (subscription required) They have even been credited with inventing the billiard table, Accessed via JSTOR (subscription required) although billiards had been played for a long time before the 1760s. They are also credited with patenting the \\"telescopic\\" (extendable) dining table and building the first Davenport desk. By 1900, the firm was producing a complete interior decoration service but this strained the company's finances - and it was taken over by Waring of Liverpool in 1903. Waring & Gillow continued but never achieved the same reputation for quality. They folded in 1962, and the Lancaster workshops closed. In war time, they built wings and propellors for the de Havilland DH9 and parts of the Mosquito. Bruce James Talbert During the 1860s and 70s, Gillows employed the Gothic Revivalist designer Bruce James Talbert (1838‚Äì81). The firm produced many items of furniture to Talbert's designs, including two sideboards from around 1872, on display at the Judges' Lodgings.A History of Gillow of Lancaster, (Lancashire County Council, 1984) In 1867, Talbert wrote Gothic Forms Applied to Furniture, Metal Work and Decoration for Domestic Purposes, this work proved to be influential on the commercial production of furniture. Talbert recommended framed construction, decorative inlay and low-relief carving. Another recommendation was the use of large, flat metal hinges.(Payne, p136) Talbert's work was displayed at numerous international exhibitions, including the International Exhibition of 1873,(Payne, p137) and his designs in the Medieval and Jacobean styles were produced by many cabinet making firms. His designs tended to be highly detailed, including bold geometric inlaid patterns, intricately carved squares of boxwood and rows of small turned spindles. Some pieces included a carved verse with a moral message. In the sideboards at the Judges' Lodgings, one of which is known as the Dundee Cabinet, produced by Gillows to Talbert's designs, his characteristic carved squares, geometric designs and rows of spindles are clearly evident. The Dundee Cabinet is made of stained baywood with inlaid panels of thuya and boxwood. The item is stamped Gillows of Lancaster. An identical piece to this cabinet is illustrated in an entry dated 8 March 1872 in Gillows' Estimate Sketch Book. The drawing is annotated Inlaid bird panel as before, therefore it appears that a similar cabinet had been made previously. An elaborated version of the cabinet appeared in Talbert's Examples of Ancient and Modern Furniture, published in 1876.Display panel, the Judges' Lodgings, Lancaster The sideboard displayed in the butler's pantry is made of oak with panels of boxwood. =Paintings= English Paintings On display in the museum are some notable works by George Romney. Romney, who was born in the Furness district of what was then Lancashire, relocated to London in the 1760s but remained in contact with Lancashire, painting the local gentry and buying picture frames from Gillows.Stuart, Susan E., ‚ÄòPart 2: Picture Frames‚Äô, in Gillows of Lancaster and London, 1730-1840: Cabinetmakers and International Merchants: A Furniture and Business History, vol. 2, Woodbridge, 2008, pp.34-45. A portrait of Abraham Rawlinson, MP for Lancaster in the 1780s, hangs in the entrance hall: it was acquired in 2006. There are also portraits by Joseph Wright of Derby and Sir Thomas Lawrence. French paintings The Creuse at Genetin, Armand Guillaumin There is a collection of six French paintings, the Lionel Hewlett bequest. This includes two landscapes by the impressionist Armand Guillaumin, one of the river Creuse and another of the √éle de R√©, showing the influence of the artist's friend Van Gogh. =Museum of childhood= Classroom The displays include a nursery with spectacular 3 seater rocking horse and a reconstructed classroom. The center of the collection is the Brian Elder collection of dolls purchased for the museum in 1976. It includes examples of peg dolls, pressed felt dolls by Lenci, poured wax dolls, bisque porcelain dolls and composition dolls by Armand Marseille, Simon & Halbig and S.F.B.J..Interpretive Board, at the Judges' Lodgings museum In the display cabinets are doll's houses, Lego, Meccano and some Hornby railway trains.

Spain completely abolished capital punishment for all offenses, including during wartime conditions, in October 1995. The last executions were carried out on September 27, 1975 when five members of ETA and Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front (FRAP) were executed by firing squad for murder following a much-publicised trial in which a number of the convicted (including a pregnant woman) were given clemency by General Francisco Franco, and the sentences of the remaining five, due to the unavailability of executioners versed in the use of the garrote, were carried out by shooting. Strangulation by garotte had been portrayed as a draconian act by the publicity after its last use in 1974, when Salvador Puig Antich was executed in Barcelona and Heinz Chez in Tarragona. History Capital punishment was common in the Spanish kingdom, and methods used included decapitation (especially for nobility). In 1820 Ferdinand VII replaced all other methods with the garrote, which was used mainly since then, including for the liberal freedom fighter Mariana de Pineda Mu√±oz and the assassin of six-time Prime Minister of Spain Antonio C√°novas del Castillo. According to a pamphlet published anonymously by Crown Prince Oscar Bernadotte, Spain was the most frequent executioner of the Western world in the early 1800s, followed by his native Sweden.Oscar Bernadotte, Om Straff och Straffanstalter (1840), unknown page The penalty was abolished by the Second Spanish Republic in 1932 but restored two years later in the midst of social and political turmoil for a few major offences, not including murder. Issue of Le Progres depicting the executions of anarchists in Xeres in 1892 by use of the garrote. =Francoist Spain= Capital punishment in Francoist Spain was restored fully on decree in 1938. From 1940 to 1975, 165 judicial executions are reported to have been carried out, although precise numbers from the years following the Spanish Civil War are vague. Among the most relevant executed from this period there is Llu√≠s Companys, President of the Generalitat of Catalonia. As Franco's regime was consolidated, use of the death penalty became more scarce; between 1950 and 1959 some 58 Spaniards (including two women) were executed by garrote and nine by firing squad. In the 1960s, the total number of executions dropped to six; two in 1960, two in 1963 and two in 1966 (less than in neighbouring France, although several of the convictions were considered political). Due to criticism, a six-year stay followed, broken when Pedro Mart√≠nez Exposito was shot in 1972 for homicide and robbery. The next executions, of Salvador Puig Antich and Heinz Chez in 1974, were allegedly held on the same day to deliberately confuse public sentiments and equalize the execution of a political opponent - both were convicted of killing Guardia Civil members - with that of a common murderer.List of persons executed in Spain since 1812: http://www.capitalpunishmentuk.org/garottel.html The last five death sentences were carried out simultaneously in Madrid, Barcelona and Burgos on September 27, 1975, prompting Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme - amongst other harsh condemnations - to denounce the regime as \\"devilish murderers\\" the following day. The imposition of the death penalty for terrorism followed its own logic during Franco's dictatorship. Sometimes it was not swiftly carried out, such as in the case of Andr√©s Ruiz M√°rquez (Coronel Montenegro),FIJLE: Boletin de Informacion - El \\"Caso Montenegro\\" a member of a Spanish National Liberation Front (FELN) commando who had set up a string of small bombs in Madrid.

It provided for the trial and punishment of lunatics for high treason. The reason given for passing the Act was given by the Act itself, which stated \\"it is a thing almost impossible certainly to judge\\" whether a defendant's madness was real or feigned. Provisions of the Act Section I of the Act provided for the trial of a person who committed treason \\"when they were in good, whole and perfect memory, and after their accusation, examination and confession thereof before any [of] the King's majesty's council, shall happen to fall to madness or lunacy\\". If it appeared to at least four of the council that the defendant was sane at the time of their offence and at their \\"accusation, examination and confession,\\" then a commission was to investigate the treason, swear in a jury, and try the defendant in his absence in the same manner as they would if he were sane and present. The section specifically provided that evidence would be admissible for the defence as well as for the prosecution. If convicted, the defendant would receive the same penalty as a sane defendant (death). The same procedure applied to a peer of the realm, except that they would be tried by their peers before the Lord High Steward instead of by a jury and a normal judge. Section II said that if the defendant had already been tried and convicted before he turned insane, then he was still to be executed in the normal manner. The Act was retrospective and applied to treasons committed before as well as after it was passed. Its effect was reversed by the Treason Act 1554 (1&2 Ph.&M.; c.10). Other treason legislation in 1542 Another Act, 33 Hen.8 c.23, abolished peremptory challenge in trials for treason and misprision of treason. This Act was repealed by the Treason Act 1554 (1&2 Ph. & M. c.10, sec.7). The Royal Assent by Commission Act 1541 (c.21) created various new kinds of high treason (which were abolished in 1547).

He is the subject of the song \\"Twice Tried, Twice Hung, Twice Buried\\" by John Raven and a book. Several geographical features in Birmingham, near his former home, carry his name.  Early life  Booth was born at Hall End Farm near Beaudesert, Warwickshire and was baptised at the church there on 21 February 1776.Warwickshire, England, Church of England Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1535-1812 William Booth, son of John and Mary Booth, Baptised 21 Feb 1776 in Beaudesert, Warwickshire, England He was one of eight children of a farmer and church warden, John Booth, and his wife Mary. On 28 February 1799, Booth signed a 25-year lease for what became known (by 1821 if not earlier) as \\"Booth's Farm\\", including a farmhouse and 200 acres of land, part of the Perry Hall estate. The farm was then in Perry Barr, Staffordshire; that part of Perry Barr is now known as Great Barr, and is in the city of Birmingham. Booth was accused of murdering his brother John while revisiting Wall End on 19 February 1808, but was acquitted for lack of evidence.  Criminal activity  After the Napoleonic Wars caused the government of William Pitt the Younger to order the Bank of England to restrict gold supply - the so called \\"Restriction Period\\" - and to issue new, low-denomination, and easily-reproducible, bank notes, Booth converted the top floor of the farmhouse into a fortified workshop where he produced forgeries of those banknotes, as well as promissory notes, coins, tokens and other material of monetary value. Once his activities came to light, a raiding party was convened on 16 March 1812, led by a constable from Birmingham, John Linwood, and comprising ten special constables and seven dragoons. Booth was arrested, tried at Stafford Assizes before Simon Le Blanc. George III, 5 shilling coin, or dollar, of the type forged by Booth He was charged with five counts: # \\"forging a 1 note, purporting to be a promissory note of the Bank of England\\" # \\"for making paper, and having in [his] possession and using a mould for making paper, with words 'Bank of England' therein\\" # \\"for using plates for making promissory notes in imitation of Bank of England notes, and for having blank bank notes in their possession without a written authority from the Governor and Company of the Bank of England, against Statute of 45th Geo.

Within two hours, he was hanged again and died. He is buried in the churchyard of St Mary's, Handsworth. The inscription on his gravestone reads: He was survived by his father, wife, sister, and two daughters, aged about fourteen, and three. Following a change of county boundary, his body was disinterred and reburied. A public outcry at the harshness of his sentence and others resulted in the death penalty in England and Wales being reserved for capital crimes. Booth also minted genuine tokens as a cover for his forging activities. Several of his tokens, forgeries and printing plates are in the collection of Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery. One token is in the British Museum.  Co-conspirators  Booth's accomplices were tried alongside him and those convicted were sentenced to transportation to Australia. Elizabeth Chidlow (or Chedlow) was sentenced to 14 years, departing in August 1813 on the . Prior to the voyage, she wrote, from the ship, at Deptford, on 8 July 1813, to the Bank of England: and received ¬£5 from them as it was their charitable custom to support women sentenced to transportation for forgery. She arrived at Port Jackson (now Sydney), New South Wales on 9 January 1814. George Scot and John Yates Snr., were each sentenced to be transported for seven years. All the other defendants were acquitted. Booth's wife, who witnesses said was active in the process of making forgeries, was not charged, as wives were considered to be under the control of their husbands.  Booth's Farm  Booth's Farm farmhouse ruins, seen in July 2020. The part nearest to the camera was the entrance porch. The farmhouse was demolished in 1974, much of the farm - still known as Booth's Farm - having been sold off for housing. An archaeological excavation was conducted at that time. As late as 1956, coins forged by Booth were found in a local garden. What remained of the farm became a sand and gravel quarry (the site is on Bunter Pebble Beds), and later a landfill site and eventually a nature reserve, with additional housing built in the 2010s. During the latter period, the buried foundations of the farmhouse were re-exposed and an information board placed alongside them.

In the 21st century, Forgers Walk, the pedestrian tunnel under the motorway, and later Booths Farm Walk, Booths Farm Close Forger Lane, and Token Rise, nearby, were so named.

Once a famous New York City landmark, the second version stood atop the tower of Madison Square Garden from 1893 to 1925. Since 1932, it has been in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The statue represents the goddess Diana. First version (1891‚Äì92) Diana was commissioned by architect Stanford White as a weather vane for the tower of Madison Square Garden, a theater-and-dining complex at 26th Street and Madison Avenue in Manhattan. He talked his friend Saint-Gaudens into creating it at no charge, and picked up the cost of materials.\\"The Architect of Desire: Beauty and Danger in the Stanford White Family,\\" Suzanna Lessard Model Julia \\"Dudie\\" Baird posed for the body of the statue. Its face is that of Davida Johnson Clark, Saint-Gaudens's long-time model and mother of his illegitimate son Louis.Davida Johnson Clark, from Metropolitan Museum of Art. The first version ‚Äì built by the W. H. Mullins Manufacturing Company in Salem, Ohio ‚Äì was tall and weighed . Saint-Gaudens's design specified that the figure appear to delicately balance on its left toe atop a ball. However, the Ohio metal shop was unable to pass the rotating rod through the toe, so the design was altered and the figure instead was poised (less-gracefully) on its heel. Diana was unveiled atop Madison Square Garden's tower on September 29, 1891. The 304-foot (92.66 m) building had been completed a year earlier, and was the second-tallest in New York City. But the addition of the statue made it the city's tallest, by 13 feet (3.96 m). Joseph J. Korum, The American Skyscraper, 1850‚Äì1940 (2008) The figure's billowing copper foulard (scarf) was intended to catch the wind, but the statue did not rotate smoothly because of its weight. Dianas nudity offended moral crusader Anthony Comstock and his New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. To placate Comstock and to increase the likelihood of its catching the wind, Saint-Gaudens draped the figure in cloth, but the cloth blew away.Federal Writers' Project. New York City Guide. New York: Random House, 1939 (Reprinted by Scholarly Press, 1976; often referred to as WPA Guide to New York City), pp.330‚Äì333 Soon after installation, both White and Saint-Gaudens concluded that the figure was too large for the building, and decided to create a smaller, lighter replacement. Following less than a year atop the tower, the statue was removed and shipped to Chicago to be exhibited at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition. New Yorker W. T. Henderson wrote a tongue-in-cheek poetic tribute ‚Äì \\"Diana Off the Tower\\" ‚Äì a play on both the statue's name and situation.W. T. Henderson, \\"Diana Off the Tower\\" (PDF), The New York Times, September 18, 1892. Saint-Gaudens served as head of the Chicago exposition's sculpture committee. His initial plan had been to place Diana atop the Women's Pavilion, but the city's Women's Christian Temperance Union protested and insisted that the controversial nude figure be clothed. Instead, it was placed atop the Agricultural Building. The original Diana does not survive. In June 1894, eight months after the exposition's closing, a major fire tore through its buildings. The lower half of the statue was destroyed; the upper half survived the fire, but was later lost or discarded.

Second version (1893‚Äìpresent) Second version of Diana with her copper foulard. Diana was completely redesigned by Saint-Gaudens ‚Äì with a more elegant pose, a different thrust to the body, a thinner figure, smaller breasts and a more graceful angle to the leg. To better fit the proportions of Madison Square Garden's tower, the statue's height was scaled down to 14.5 feet (4.4 m).The Philadelphia Museum of Art's website lists the height of the figure as 13 ft 1 in (398.8 cm), and the height of the ball as 17 in (43 cm). The second version was made of hollowed copper, and weighed 700 lb (318 kg) ‚Äì more than 60% less than the first version ‚Äì light enough to rotate with the wind. As Saint- Gaudens originally envisioned, the figure was balanced on its left toe atop a ball. The statue was hoisted to the top of the tower on November 18, 1893. During the day, the gilded figure caught the sun and could be seen from all over the city and as far away as New Jersey. Electric lights, then a novelty, illuminated it at night; it was the first statue in history to be lit by electricity. Madison Square Garden was slated to be demolished in 1925, to make way for construction of the New York Life Building. Prior to the building's demolition, Diana was removed and put in storage. The intention was for the statue to remain in New York City, however a seven year search to find a place to display it proved futile. In 1932, the New York Life Insurance Company presented Diana to the Philadelphia Museum of Art as a gift. It remains there today, displayed on the balcony of the museum's Great Stair Hall.Object record in the Philadelphia Museum of Art's online collection. =Restoration= Second version of Diana (restored, 2013‚Äì14), Philadelphia Museum of Art. When Diana was removed from Madison Square Garden in 1925, much of its gilded exterior was gone, having eroded away over three decades of exposure to the elements. The Philadelphia Museum of Art cleaned and repaired the statue in 1932, but the gold leaf was not replaced. In 2013, scaffolding was constructed around the statue in the museum's Great Stair Hall for a year- long restoration. Conservators carefully cleaned its copper surface with chemicals and steam, removing nearly a century of dirt and grime. Samples of the small patches of remaining gold leaf on the statue were taken in an effort to match the carat, weight and color with its replacement. The statue's surface was then repaired and regilded with 180 square feet of gold leaf. Because it was known from contemporary sources that Saint-Gaudens did not like the look of bright gold at eye level, the conservators matted the gilding to reduce the glare and museum lighting designers adjusted the display lights for the interior display. On July 14, 2014, the restored statue was unveiled and rededicated. =Cultural references= In the popular 1975 novel Ragtime, author E.L. Doctorow suggests in a single line that showgirl Evelyn Nesbitt had posed for the second version of the Diana statue. Having grown up poor in the streets of a Pennsylvania coal town, Nesbitt had risen up to become ‚Äúthe Gaudens statue Stanny White had put at the top of the tower of Madison Square Garden, a glorious bronze nude Diana, her bow drawn, her face in the skies.‚Äù The 1981 film version of Ragtime expanded upon this incident as the cause of a major conflict between Stanford White and Nesbitt's millionaire husband Harry K. Thaw. In the film, Thaw demands that the statue be taken down from the top of the Garden as it is an embarrassment to him. The character is seen glaring angrily at the statue before shooting White to death at the Rooftop Theatre at Madison Square Garden on June 25, 1906. Both situations are completely fictional. The second version of Diana was placed atop the tower in 1893, when Nesbitt was only about nine years old, and eight years before she was introduced to White. Other versions =Half-sized statues= Half-sized Diana (1928), Metropolitan Museum of Art. Stanford White was so pleased with the 1893 second version that he asked Saint-Gaudens to create a half-sized copy in cement. This was installed in 1894 in the garden of White's Long Island estate, Box Hill, where it stood for many years. For the half-sized copy, Saint-Gaudens poised the figure on a half-ball. White's cement statue later was used to produce two bronze casts in 1928, and six bronze casts in 1987.John H. Dryfhout, The Works of Augustus Saint-Gaudens (UPNE, 2008), cat. 154, p. 207.

Tehuacan Valley Sequence The Tehuacan Valley Sequence was a project directed by Richard MacNeish which involved an archaeological survey of the Tehuacan Valley and excavations at various archaeological sites in the region - six excavated sites and seven surface sites. The findings of the project allowed the entirety of the occupation of the Tehuacan Valley to be understood. This sequence provided the first broad perspective of the transition from a foraging society to a village farming society in Mesoamerica. Dates established for the El Riego phase are based on sixteen radiocarbon assays. Social organization The social organization of the El Riego phase is characteristic of the Early Archaic period in Mesoamerica; hunter gatherer societies with established seasonal camps. The two types of camps being used in the Tehuacan Valley at this time were dry season micro-band camps used by small bands often consisting of a single family, and wet season macro-band camps used by numerous bands or families. The hunter gatherer peoples traveled between the camps to follow the migration of the wild animals they hunted. Subsistence practices Subsistence during the El Riego phase was reliant on wild animals and plants. In the earlier part of the phase the people were most likely seasonal nomads, moving from small hunting camps and temporary villages.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2008). \\"El Riego Phase\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Inc. Retrieved Oct. 15, 2011. Throughout the El Riego phase plants grew increasingly important to the peoples, and towards the end of the phase there may have been experimental domestication and planting of native plant species such as squash, chili, and avocado. Material culture and spirituality Through the archaeological excavations done on important sites such as Tecorral, Coxcatl√°n, Purron, and Abejas, material culture from the El Riego phase has been discovered and consists largely of stone tools, evidence of weaving through the discovery of blankets and baskets, and woodworking through the findings of dart shafts and animal traps. Numerous scraper planes and food-grinding stones dating to the El Riego phase were discovered at Coxcatl√°n Cave, as well as projectile points with greater form diversity than seen previously. The first evidence of deliberate burials has been found to date to the El Riego phase, as well as potential evidence of the first instances of human sacrifice.

It was the central feature of the now-closed St. Gregory's University (also known as St. Gregory's Abbey and College), housing its administration, library and most of its classes. Designed by St. Louis architect Victor Klutho, the facility opened in the fall of 1915. St. Gregory's College grew from the Sacred Heart Mission in Sacred Heart, Oklahoma. Established in 1876 in what was then called Indian Territory, the mission school considered moving to a more populated area in the 1890s. After a 1901 fire that destroyed much of what was then called the \\"Catholic University of Oklahoma\\", the decision was made to move the high school and college to Shawnee, to the north. Viktor Klutho was hired to design the new facility. A specialist in Tudor revival architecture, Klutho designed a massive five-story brick building to combine church, school and abbey in a single edifice, opening to 40 boys in the fall term of 1915. This served until the 1940s when a new church was built nearby, and in the 1950s the abbey moved to a new campus adjoining the school. In the 1960s the school discontinued high school education and admitted women to the college. Description The college required a fireproof structure, so the new school was built of reinforced concrete, and surplus railroad rails from the Rock Island Railroad used in the foundation. The concrete walls were faced with brick, with stone accents. The building is a solid rectangle with a footprint of by . The central portion of the building is expressed as a battlemented tower, four stories high over a raised basement, with slender corner turrets. From the main mass on either side extend four-story wings on raised basements, accented by projecting three-story oriel bays. The top of the wing is accentuated by a segmental balustrade. The main level contained administrative offices and the main entry. The second floor was occupied by the library. The third floor was classroom space and the fourth floor was reserved for science laboratories and classrooms. The large space within the fifth floor tower was originally a gymnasium, now a lecture hall. The basement housed support facilities. In 1967, a proposal to demolish the building was rejected due to the potential costs to raze such a solid structure. It was renovated, adding a T-section concrete stair tower to the exterior of the west side. The building housed most of what became St. Gregory University's classes. 2011 Oklahoma earthquake Benedictine Hall was damaged by the 2011 Oklahoma earthquake. One turret collapsed immediately following the quake. In the days that followed the earthquake, one of the turrets had to be pushed down, and the other two were removed brick by brick. More than 3,400 donors from around the world contributed roughly $2.5 million to help the school reconstruct the turrets. Timberlake Construction and Advanced Masonry, both of Oklahoma City, were charged with the task of rebuilding the turrets ‚Äì this time with steel \\"bones\\" that could withstand an earthquake. The decorative aspects of the towers were faithfully recreated. The brick was matched to the rest of the building, and the grotesques and shields that were part of the original gothic architecture, were molded in the exact image of their predecessors. The new turrets were officially blessed during Homecoming on November 9, 2013. Sale of the building In December of 2018 the sale to Hobby Lobby of the Shawnee campus of St. Gregory's University, including Benedictine Hall, was approved by the bankruptcy court. The campus was leased to Oklahoma Baptist University, a private Christian liberal arts university in Shawnee. In May of 2019, OBU renamed the tract as the OBU Green Campus, both in honor of the Green family, owners of Hobby Lobby, and because the color green is one of OBU‚Äôs official university colors. In December of 2019, Hobby Lobby and the Green family donated the campus to OBU.

The band consists of Fredua Boakye (vocals), Sheel Dav√© (drums), Salim Akram (guitar), Graham Masser (bass), and Santiago Araujo (guitar). All five members of the band originally played in the Boston-based band The Eclectic Collective, which in 2007 they reworked and renamed Bad Rabbits. The band released a demo in 2008 entitled The Bad EP which was followed up by their debut EP, Stick Up Kids, in December 2009. Their first album American Love was released on May 14, 2013, and on July 19, 2014, Bad Rabbits released Dusted ‚Äì an acoustic EP. They have won four Boston Music Awards, including Pop/R&B; Live Artist of the Year in 2014. Bad Rabbits also won the 2010 Phoenix Music Poll Award for Most Downloaded Band. From 2007 to 2010, they performed as the backing band for rapper Slick Rick. They have been a part of five national tours, including the 2011 and 2014 Vans Warped Tour, the 2013 Don Broco Priorities UK tour, the 2014 Allen Stone US Tour and their own UK tour in 2014. Early history The five members of Bad Rabbits first came together in 2002 while attending Northeastern University and Audio Institute in Boston, MA. Boakye and Akram were performing as a duo, Dav√© was a member of experimental metal band Irepress, and Araujo was playing in a jam/rock band with Masser. A mutual friend introduced Masser and Araujo to Dav√© at the YMCA dormitory on Northeastern's campus. The group performed their first show as The Eclectic Collective on January 16, 2003, at All Asia in Cambridge. There were various lineup changes which primarily included Akram, Boakye, Dav√©, Araujo, Masser, RP Thompson (keys), Geoff ‚ÄúDJ Special Blend‚Äù Ford, as well as singer Noni Kai on vocals, trumpet player and rapper Peter ‚ÄúAfrodzak‚Äù Shungu, and saxophonist Robert Oswald. After two independent album releases and a tour in the Fall of 2007 with artist Gavin Castleton, the group decided to call it quits. Not happy with the direction The Eclectic Collective had taken, the band decided to change its name and overall direction. Bad Rabbits takes its name from one of Gavin Castleton‚Äôs songs, which the group performed while on tour with him. Career In the fall of 2008, the band self-released a four-song demo titled The Bad EP. The EP contains the song ‚ÄúThe Bad‚Äù, which became the song now known as ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Bad‚Äù. In spring 2009, the band entered the studio with producer Jayson Michael Dezuzio to record their debut EP, Stick Up Kids. The album was completed in fall 2009 and released independently that December. The band also entered into a relationship with Boston-based online retailer Karmaloop.com, who distributed and promoted the album through their website. A remix compilation of the Stick Up Kids EP was released in the fall; it included remixes from Clinton Sparks, Crookers, Roxy Cottontail, Hot Pink Delorean, and Alex Suarez. Tracks on this release include \\"Booties\\", \\"Neverland\\", \\"Stick Up Kids\\", \\"Girl I'm Like Damn!\\" (featuring Travie McCoy of Gym Class Heroes), \\"She's Bad\\", \\"Advantage Me\\" and \\"Can't Back Down\\". On May 14, 2013, the album American Love was released. It reached #1 on the iTunes R&B; album chart and #35 iTunes album chart. The album also reached #10 on the Billboard Heatseeker Chart, #12 Billboard R&B; Albums and #29 on the Billboard Hip-Hop/R&B; Album Chart. The first single from American Love, \\"We Can Roll\\", is a one-sided 7\\" vinyl single, with the iconic \\"BR\\" logo hand- printed onto the blank B-side. Each copy came housed in a jacket that was hand screen printed with a 3D spot glitter and each record was individually numbered. The band released three more albums; an acoustic album titled Dusted (July 9, 2014) and the albums American Nightmare (November 21, 2016) and Mimi (August 9, 2018). In 2020, the band will celebrate the 10 year anniversary of Stick Up Kids with shows in Boston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

It is a marine demersal fish, and occurs at depths down to about . It was named in honour of Dr R. P. Dollfus who led an expedition to Egypt in 1928‚Äì1929 and who brought back some specimens of this fish which he mistakenly identified as Uranoscopus affinis. These were new to science and became the type specimens of the new species U. dollfusi, with the Gulf of Suez being the type locality. Description Dollfus' stargazer grows to a maximum length of about . The body is somewhat elongate and tapers towards the tail. The head is bony and somewhat flattened, with and eyes set near the top and an upturned mouth, fringed with papillae. A ribbon-like tentacle projects from inside the lower jaw. There is a large, upward-pointing venomous humeral spine, further spines above the wide gill openings and three downward-pointing blunt spines in front of the eye. The dorsal fin is divided into two parts and has four spines and twelve to fourteen soft rays. The anal fin has thirteen to fourteen soft rays and the caudal fin is slightly rounded. The lateral line is high on the body and there are no scales on the head, nape or abdomen apart from a few embedded ones above the front of the lateral line. The colour of this fish is greyish-brown with paler underparts. There are reddish bony ridges on the head and the spinous dorsal fin is black with a white base. The caudal fin has a white margin. Biology Dollfus' stargazer is an ambush predator. It lies on the seabed submerged in the sediment with just its eyes and fringed mouth projecting. The tentacle on its lower jaw can be waved around to act as a lure, and it then snaps at any small fish that come close enough.

Governments at all levels (national, regional and local) need to raise revenue from a variety of sources to finance public-sector expenditures. Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations (1776) wrote: : \\"Such things as defending the country and maintaining the institutions of good government are of general benefit to the public. Thus, it is reasonable that the population as a whole should contribute to the tax costs. It is also reasonable to demand certain other things of a tax system ‚Äì for example, that the amounts of tax individuals pay should bear some relationship to their abilities to pay‚Ä¶ Good taxes meet four major criteria. They are (1) proportionate to incomes or abilities to pay (2) certain rather than arbitrary (3) payable at times and in ways convenient to the taxpayers and (4) cheap to administer and collect.\\" Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations: A Translation into Modern English, ISR/Google Books, 2015. Book 5 (Government Finances: Public Expenditure, Taxation and Borrowing), pages 423, 429. Ebook In modern public-finance literature, there have been two main issues: who can pay and who can benefit (Benefit principle). Influential theories have been the ability theory presented by Arthur Cecil Pigou and the benefit theory developed by Erik Lindahl. There is a later version of the benefit theory known as the \\"voluntary exchange\\" theory. Under the benefit theory, tax levels are automatically determined, because taxpayers pay proportionately for the government benefits they receive. In other words, the individuals who benefit the most from public services pay the most taxes. Here, two models adopting the benefit approach are discussed: the Lindahl model and the Bowen model. Lindahl's model alt=Graph with curved, multicolored lines Lindahl tries to solve three problems: *Extent of state activity *Allocation of the total expenditure among various goods and services *Allocation of tax burden In the Lindahl model, if SS is the supply curve of state services it is assumed that production of social goods is linear and homogenous. DDa is the demand curve of taxpayer A, and DDb is the demand curve of taxpayer B. The Horizontal summation of the two demand curves results in the community‚Äôs total demand schedule for state services. A and B pay different proportions of the cost of the services which is vertically measured. When ON is the amount of state services produced, A contributes NE and B contributes NF; the cost of supply is NG. Since the state is non-profit, it increases its supply to OM. At this level, A contributes MJ and B contributes MR (the total cost of supply). Equilibrium is reached at point P on a voluntary-exchange basis. The Lindahl equilibrium proposes that individuals pay for the provision of a public good according to their marginal benefits in order to determine the efficient level of provision for public goods. In the equilibrium state, all individuals consume the same quantity of public goods but may face different prices because some people may value a particular good more than others. The Lindahl equilibrium price is the resulting amount paid by an individual for his or her share of the public goods. Bowen's model alt=Graph with multicolored lines Bowen‚Äôs model has more operational significance, since it demonstrates that when social goods are produced under conditions of increasing costs, the opportunity cost of private goods is foregone. For example, if there is one social good and two taxpayers (A and B), their demand for social goods is represented by a and b; therefore, a+b is the total demand for social goods. The supply curve is shown by a'+b', indicating that goods are produced under conditions of increasing cost. The production cost of social goods is the value of foregone private goods; this means that a'+b' is also the demand curve of private goods. The intersection of the cost and demand curves at B determines how a given national income should (according to taxpayers' desires) be divided between social and private goods; hence, there should be OE social goods and EX private goods. Simultaneously, the tax shares of A and B are determined by their individual demand schedules. The total tax requirement is the area (ABEO) out of which A is willing to pay GCEO and B is willing to pay FDEO. =Advantages and limitations= The advantage of the benefit theory is the direct correlation between revenue and expenditure in a budget. It approximates market behaviour in the allocation procedures of the public sector. Although simple in its application, the benefit theory has difficulties: *It limits the scope of government activities *Government can neither support the poor nor take steps to stabilize the economy *Applicable only when beneficiaries can be observed directly (impossible for most public services) *Taxation in accord with the benefit principle would leave distribution of real incomes unchanged =Ability-to-pay approach= The ability-to-pay approach treats government revenue and expenditures separately. Taxes are based on taxpayers‚Äô ability to pay; there is no quid pro quo. Taxes paid are seen as a sacrifice by taxpayers, which raises the issues of what the sacrifice of each taxpayer should be and how it should be measured: *Equal sacrifice: The total loss of utility as a result of taxation should be equal for all taxpayers (the rich will be taxed more heavily than the poor) *Equal proportional sacrifice: The proportional loss of utility as a result of taxation should be equal for all taxpayers *Equal marginal sacrifice: The instantaneous loss of utility (as measured by the derivative of the utility function) as a result of taxation should be equal for all taxpayers. This therefore will entail the least aggregate sacrifice (the total sacrifice will be the least). Mathematically, the conditions are as follows: *Equal absolute sacrifice=U(Y)-U(Y-T), where y=income and t=tax amount *Equal proportional sacrifice=(U(Y)-U(Y-T))/U(Y), where U(Y)=total utility from y *Equal marginal sacrifice=(dU(Y-T))/(d(Y-T)) References ","title":"Theories of taxation"},{"id":"33679438","title":"1903 Bulgarian parliamentary election"},{"id":"33679449","text":"Whitemargin stargazer (Uranoscopus sulphureus) is a fish of family Uranoscopidae, widespread in the Indopacific: Red Sea, Indonesia, Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga.Uranoscopus sulphureus at FishBase Marine reef-associated fish, up to 45.0 cm maximal length.

E. S.\\" or \\"Gi\\" Stephens (November 4, 1900 ‚Äì June 9, 1973), was a Virginia lawyer and Democratic Party politician who served in both houses of the Virginia General Assembly and as the 27th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia from 1952 to 1962.A. E. S. Stephens entry at The Political Graveyard His state political career ended with a loss in the Democratic primary for Governor in 1961, after he and Governor James Lindsay Almond Jr. broke with the Byrd Organization, which wanted to continue its policy of Massive Resistance to desegregation of Virginia's schools after both the Virginia Supreme Court and a 3-judge federal panel ruled most elements unconstitutional in 1959. Early and family life Born on November 4, 1900, in Wicomico Church, Virginia, Gi was the fourth son of J.W.G. Stephens (a former cowboy turned general merchandise store owner) and Allie Tyson Beane Stephens. He attended local public schools in Northumberland County through high school. Beginning in 1919, Stevens attended the College of William and Mary where he was a star baseball pitcher. There he gained the nickname \\"Gi\\" meaning \\"giraffe\\" for his lanky physique. He continued on to graduate with both an undergraduate and a law degree in 1923, declining an offer to play for the Washington Senators farm system. He married Anna Spratley Delk (1903‚Äì2001) of Smithfield in 1928, and they had three children (and many grandchildren) who survived their parents. Career Upon admission to the Virginia bar, Stephens began a private legal practice in Isle of Wight County, Virginia. He declined to run against the local commonwealth's attorney in 1927, having witnessed that man successfully transport an accused African- American prisoner to the Petersburg jail rather than accede to a local lynch mob. Stephens did, however, become active in politics, and later the Byrd Organization. He was elected the Isle of Wight's delegate to the Virginia House of Delegates in 1929 and served for 12 years in that part-time position. In 1940, Stephens successfully ran for Senate District 5, then encompassing Nansemond, Suffolk, Southampton, and Isle of Wight. His main legislative accomplishments included establishing the Hampton Roads Sanitation Commission, the Denny Commission (which improved public education) and assisting the local seafood industry. After the unexpected death of lieutenant governor Lewis Preston Collins II, Stephens ran in the 3-candidate Democratic primary and won in the special election as well. He took office on December 2, 1952, and won reelection in 1953 and 1957. During the Massive Resistance crisis, after both the Virginia Supreme Court and a 3-judge federal panel held most elements of the Stanley Plan unconstitutional, Stephens and Governor James Lindsay Almond Jr. realized further active resistance was futile, and hurt Virginia businesses as well as citizens. In April 1959, Stephens presided over the State Senate during a parliamentary maneuver that helped State Senators Mosby Perrow Jr., Armistead Boothe and Stuart B. Carter (among others) narrowly secure passage of bills which allowed localities to determine whether to desegregate their schools.Robert Heinemann, Harry Byrd of Virginia (Charlottesville, University of Virginia Press, 1996) pp. 350‚Äì351 Stephens resigned in December 1960 to run for governor (following Almond's early declaration example). However, the Byrd Organization slated Albertis Harrison (the attorney general who had supported segregation and litigation against the NAACP) as their candidate. Stephens lost in the 1961 Democratic primary (199,519 to 152,639), and Byrd loyalists Mills Godwin defeated moderate Armistead Boothe for lieutenant Governor and Robert Young Button defeated professor T. Munford Boyd for attorney general. However, the machine's vote totals were lower than previously. Harrison defeated Republican H. Clyde Pearson in November, as the Byrd slate won one of its last victories as Virginia's demographics changed.Heinemann pp. 407‚Äì409\\\\Frank B. Atkinson, The Dynamic Dominion (Rowman & Littlefield, 2006) pp 129‚Äì132 Stanley never again ran for statewide office, though he served as the town attorney for Smithfield until December, 1971, and remained active in the town's Christ Episcopal Church. He retained political influence in Virginia, even as the Byrd organization declined. Stephens helped restore and preserve the commonwealth's oldest Episcopal church, St. Luke's Church, and was a member of Old Dominion University's Board of Visitors until 1972. Death and legacy Stephens died after a short illness at Riverside Hospital in Newport News, Virginia. He and Anna are buried in the cemetery of the historic St. Luke's Church at Smithfield that they helped preserve. Old Dominion University has his papers from 1949‚Äì1961.

In 1906, Bandera, led an army of insurgents toward Havana, and was killed near Punta Brava, a village close to Havana. Biography Bandera was a hero of the Cuban War of Independence, \\"noted for his fearlessness and bravery,\\"; also cited in during which he had distinguished himself by breaking through the Spanish line which separated Pinar del R√≠o Province from Havana Province. He fought alongside General Calixto Garc√≠a, and alongside M√°ximo G√≥mez with his ragged band of \\"Orientales.\\" In 1899, he was considered a leader of the Afro-Cuban population of Santiago de Cuba Province. He had become popular with black population of the island as a whole, thousands of whom had welcomed him to Havana in 1900 and had carried him through the city's streets for hours, and was known for delivering fiery speeches about how the new republic did not reward its black citizens. In 1906, insurrection broke out against the presidency of Tom√°s Estrada Palma, Cuba's first president after independence. Minor protests had already taken place the year before, but in August 1906 a band led by Pino Guerra started a more serious uprising in Pinar del R√≠o Province. One general suspected of participating was Jos√© Miguel G√≥mez, later president of Cuba, who was quickly arrested and jailed. During that time, General Bandera, \\"that sexagenarian hero of all the blacks in the island,\\" moved at the head of a group of a thousand black insurgents toward Havana and occupied a railroad station. Bandera had lost his office and broke into the Cuban senate, but instead of being made chief of police, as he demanded, he was appointed \\"parliamentary doorkeeper.\\" He consequently took up arms. Colon Cemetery At the Silveira farm near Punta Brava, Bandera made his last stand with twenty of his followers. He was surrounded by troops led by General Freyre Andrade, and a group of Rural Guards stormed the farm. Most of the insurgents managed to slip away, leaving only Bandera and two of his comrades: shot multiple times, according to reports, he continued \\"wielding his machete until the foe had cut him to pieces.\\" The three bodies were \\"horribly mutilated by machete cuts\\" and moved to Havana to be put on display. Bandera's death put a momentary stop to the 1906 insurrection; he was approximately seventy two years when he died.

Its body is suited for living on the sea floor, and is one of few fish capable of bioelectrogenesis, or the ability to generate an electric charge. Distribution and habitat It is widespread along the Atlantic coast of Europe and Africa, is very common in the Mediterranean and Black Sea, and somewhat rare in the Bay of Biscay.Uranoscopus scaber at FishBase It is a demersal fish, which lives in sandy or muddy sand sediments along the upper slope of the continental shelf, between depths of 14‚Äì400 meters. It is not an economically important fish, primarily caught as by- catch, but is ecologically important. Description Typical of stargazers, its body is somewhat dorso-ventrally flattened, lacks a swimbladder, and has been found as large as 35.0 centimeters in length, but is usually between 20‚Äì30 cm. Its head and jaws are rotated upward, and has very large eyes and mouth. Its body is brown in color and can have numerous small light spots, with a lighter belly. It lives to about 5 or 6 years, and females are larger in size than males. Biology =Feeding= Like other stargazers, it is an ambush predator which lies buried under sand with only its eyes showing. It has a large mouth, with a small strip of skin protruding from its lower jaw, which it moves in and out rapidly to act as a lure for prey. When a prey item comes near, the fish lunges toward the prey using a specially adapted vertebral column to generate the force by bending 60¬∞, which takes less than 30 milliseconds to engulf the prey. It feeds primarily on fish larvae and smaller fishes, such as gobies, picarels, and small crustaceans, but has also been known to eat molluscs, echinoderms, annelids, algae and plant material. =Reproduction= They can spawn between April and September, depending on the region, and produce pelagic eggs, about 2 millimeters in diameter. After hatching, the larvae, post-larvae, and juveniles remain pelagic. Males are slightly more common than females, but this can vary within local populations. =Electric organ= All species within the genus Uranoscopus, along with those in Astroscopus, have evolved electric organs, but lack receptor organs. These were both independently evolved, and are the only two genera within the order Perciformes to produce electric organ discharges (EODs). The Atlantic stargazer, like other bioelectrogenic stargazers, produces pulse-type EODs while feeding and when it is disturbed. The Atlantic stargazer produces EODs with the electric organ, derived from sonic muscles. In other fishes, sonic muscles are used to produce sound by agitating the swim bladder.

Chemaf (Chemical of Africa) owns the license. Chemaf is 95% owned by Shalina Resources and 5% by the DRC government. Location The Etoile mine is located at an elevation of about above sea level. The climate is sub-tropical, with annual rainfall of about falling mostly in the October to March period. Average temperatures are between and , with no marked difference between summer and winter. The region lies in a zone that would naturally be covered by Miombo Woodland, deciduous tropical woodlands. Lying on the edge of Lubumbashi, much of the woodland has been cleared. The Etoile orebody lies within the copperbelt that stretches from Luanshya in Zambia to Kolwezi in the DRC. As with many of the deposits in southern Katanga, it is a stratiform copper-cobalt deposit. An enlarged oxide cap about overlays an inclined stratiform sulphide deposit. Early production Tanganyika Concessions Ltd dug pits and trenches in the area in 1907. Union Mini√®re du Haut Katanga (UMHK) discovered the Etoile ore body in 1911, and the Ruashi ore body in 1919. For the next half century both properties were quarried intermittently for their high-grade copper ore. Originally named the Kalukuluku mine, the Belgians later renamed it L'Etoile du Congo Mine (Star of the Congo Mine). copper smelting of 'Etoile du Congo' Katanga, 1912-1914 UMHK was nationalized in 1967. Control of all copper and cobalt exploration and production was given to G√©camines, established as the state mining company. G√©camines operated the Ruashi and Etoile mines until the end of the 1960s. Artisanal miners then worked the two mines until 2000, when they were put up for sale separately. Recent operations Chemaf gained the rights to Etoile in 2003. The mine opened in 2005, and Chemaf started production of refined copper in 2007. In 2008, copper cathode production was 11,353 tonnes. Chemaf was planning to commission a new SX/EW plant in 2009 with 6,000 tonnes/year capacity to produce refined cobalt. A 2008 assessment confirmed that there was 13.5 million tonnes of ore in the pit, graded 3.3% copper and 0.55% cobalt. The unusually high grade of cobalt means that this contributes over half the revenue. The mine produced 1,071,516 tonnes of ore in 2009.

Background and takeover of Lulong Circuit  It is not known when Li Kuangchou was born, but it is known that his family was from Lulong Circuit's capital Fanyang.Old Book of Tang, vol. 180. His father Li Quanzhong had overthrown then-military governor of Lulong, Li Keju, in 885 and taken over as military governor; after Li Quanzhong's death in 886, Li Kuangchou's older brother Li Kuangwei took over the circuitZizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. and was then made military governor.New Book of Tang, vol. 212. Not much is known about Li Kuangchou's activities during Li Kuangwei's governance, but it is known that he married a Lady Zhang, who was said to be of extremely rare beauty. In 893, as Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi) was attacking Li Kuangwei's ally Wang Rong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (ÊàêÂæ∑, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), Li Kuangwei prepared to lead his army to aid Wang. At a feast that family members held for him to send him off, Li Kuangwei, while drunk, raped Lady Zhang, causing resentment by Li Kuangchou. As Li Kuangwei's army was returning from Chengde after being successful in forcing Li Keyong's withdrawal, Li Kuangchou took over the circuit headquarters, claimed the title of acting military governor, and issued orders for soldiers to report back to the headquarters. Li Kuangwei's soldiers largely abandoned him and fled to Li Kuangchou, allowing Li Kuangchou to take over without further military action by Li Kuangwei. (Li Kuangwei then remarked that Li Kuangchou lacked talent and, while he was not mourning because the control of the circuit remained in the family, he would be surprised if Li Kuangchou could hold on to the circuit for even two years.) Subsequently, Wang welcomed Li Kuangwei to Chengde Circuit and, out of gratitude, honored him like a father (as Wang was himself only 19 years oldZizhi Tongjian, vol. 255.), but Li Kuangwei then tried to seize the circuit from Wang, and was killed by soldiers loyal to Wang. Hearing of Li Kuangwei's death, Li Kuangchou submitted a petition to then-reigning Emperor Zhaozong, requesting permission to attack Chengde to avenge Li Kuangwei; Emperor Zhaozong refused to grant such permission. Meanwhile, the officer Liu Rengong, whose soldiers had long been stationed at Wei Prefecture (ËîöÂ∑û, in modern Zhangjiakou, Hebei) and who had wanted to return to You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, i.e., Fanyang), led his soldiers to attack Li Kuangchou. Li Kuangchou's army, however, defeated Liu's at Juyong Pass, and Liu fled to Li Keyong's Hedong Circuit. Later in the year, even without Emperor Zhaozong's authorization, Li Kuangchou attacked Chengde cities Leshou (Ê®ÇÂ£Ω, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei) and Wuqiang (Ê≠¶Âº∑, in modern Hengshui, Hebei), ostensibly to avenge Li Kuangwei. In spring 894, Emperor Zhaozong officially commissioned him as military governor.  Defeat and death  After Liu Rengong's arrival in Hedong, he was treated kindly by Li Keyong. Liu then, through Li Keyong's chief strategist Gai Yu, submitted a request for Li Keyong to give him 10,000 men so that he could capture Lulong. Li Keyong agreed with the plan, but initially only had a few thousand men to give Liu. The initial attacks therefore failed. This led to Li Kuangchou's misjudging of the situation and believing that he could defeat Hedong forces, so he made frequent incursions into Hedong territory. In anger, Li Keyong himself commanded a major attack against Lulong in winter 894. He quickly captured Wu Prefecture (Ê≠¶Â∑û, in modern Zhangjiakou) and put Xin Prefecture (Êñ∞Ê¥≤, in modern Zhangjiakou as well) under siege. After a relief force Li Kuangchou sent was defeated by Li Keyong at nearby Duanzhuang (), Xin Prefecture surrendered to Li Keyong. Another army of Li Kuangchou's was then defeated by Li Keyong and his adoptive son Li Cunshen. Li Kuangchou took his family members and fled to Cang Prefecture (ÊªÑÂ∑û, in modern Cangzhou), the capital of neighboring Yichang Circuit (). Yichang's military governor Lu Yanwei, however, was enticed by the wealth and concubines that Li Kuangchou was bringing with him, so he sent an army to ambush Li Kuangchou, killing him and taking the others in his party captive. You Prefecture then surrendered to Li Keyong, who gave control of the circuit to Liu Rengong. (Lady Zhang, who was then nursing an infant, was unable to flee. Liu captured her and gave her to Li Keyong, who took her as a concubine; she later became his favorite.)

It dates back to 1897. From 1962 until 2010 it was named Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hannover (University of Music and Drama Hanover), short: Musikhochschule Hannover. Since 2010, the president is Susanne Rode-Breymann. As of 2013, the university has approximately 1,443 students, taught by 361 teachers in 33 courses for musicians, actors, music teachers, musicologists and media scholars. History The university traces its history back to 1897, when a private \\"Conservatorium f√ºr Musik\\" (conservatory of music) began its operation. It was made the Konservatorium of the city in 1911. In 1943 the institution was named Landesmusikschule (State music school). The building was destroyed. In 1950, the Landesmusikschule was united with a private \\"Hannoversche Schauspielschule\\" (Hanover drama school) to form the Akademie f√ºr Musik und Theater (Academy of Music and Theatre). In 1958 the school achieved the status of Hochschule and was organized as \\"Nieders√§chsische Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater\\" and \\"Nieders√§chsische Musikschule Hannover\\". In 1962 the two were united as the \\"Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater\\" (HMTH, State University of Music and Drama Hanover). Above the entrance of the 1973 main building Between 1970 and 1973 the present main building was built at the Emmichplatz, bordering the park Eilenriede. In 1973 the state Lower Saxony is responsible for the organisation of the Hochschule. In 1978 it received the status of an artistic-scientific university. The European Centre for Jewish Music was established by Andor Izs√°k in the Villa Seligmann in 1988, which since 1992 has been an institute of HMTH. It deals with the documentation and reconstruction of Jewish liturgical music. Since 2001 the university runs an institute for the early training of highly gifted students, the 'Institut zur Fr√ºh-F√∂rderung Hochbegabter' (IFF, Institute for the Advancement of Young Musicians). In 2010 the 'Institute of Chamber Music' and the 'Institute for Early Music' was founded. The name was extended by \\"Media\\". Architecture Main building, Emmichplatz Villa Seligmann Main building The main building of the university is a structure in the shape of an ear, which is reflected in the logo. It was then one of the most modern buildings designed especially for the purpose of an artistic institution. In addition to the main site at the Emmichplatz, it has sites at Schiffgraben, Bismarckstra√üe and the Expo Plaza, the site of the Expo 2000 (Acting course, Institute of Journalism and Communication Research). The , formerly the home of director of Continental AG in the Hohenzollernstra√üe, was acquired in 2006 for the European Centre for Jewish Music and opened in 2012 after restoration.  Courses  The HMTMH offers all of the standard classical courses of a university of music. The emphasis is on the areas of music education, artistic education, solo training, and theatre training. It also teaches jazz, rock, pop as part of a popular music program, with an emphasis on jazz. The study programs in the areas of piano, orchestra and chamber music are particularly pronounced, especially in the artistic education and music education. The drama and opera departments are in close cooperation with the Staatsoper Hannover, the Staatstheater Hannover and the NDR Radiophilharmonie. The university stages about two annual opera productions, including premieres, and about three orchestral concerts. The university also maintains artistic and scientific relations with several national and international music colleges and universities, including Switzerland, Eastern Europe and East Asia.  Organ  The HMTMH owns an organ, used for teaching and concerts, installed at the Neust√§dter Kirche. Called the Spanish organ, it was installed on the north balcony 1998‚Äì2001 by Patrick Collon (Belgium). It reflects principles of Spanish Baroque organ building without copying a specific instrument.

Although animal welfare has been of great concern for many thousands of years in religion and culture, the investigation of animal welfare using rigorous scientific methods is a relatively recent development. The world's first Professor of Animal Welfare Science, Donald Broom, was appointed by Cambridge University (UK) in 1986. Historical legislation and guidelines Early legislation which formed the impetus for assessing animal welfare and the subsequent development of animal welfare science include the Ireland Parliament (Thomas Wentworth) \\"An Act against Plowing by the Tayle, and pulling the Wooll off living Sheep\\", 1635, and the Massachusetts Colony (Nathaniel Ward) \\"Off the Bruite Creatures\\" Liberty 92 and 93 in the \\"Massachusetts Body of Liberties\\" of 1641. Richard Martin's act, the \\"Cruel Treatment of Cattle Act 1822\\" is often considered to be the precursor of modern relevant legislation. One of the first national laws to protect animals was the UK \\"Cruelty to Animals Act 1835\\" followed by the \\"Protection of Animals Act 1911\\". In the US it was many years until there was a National law to protect animals‚Äîthe \\"Animal Welfare Act of 1966\\"‚Äîalthough there were a number of states that passed anti-cruelty laws between 1828 and 1898. In India, animals are protected by the \\"Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960\\". In the UK, the \\"Animal Welfare Act 2006\\" consolidated many different forms of animal welfare legislation. Animal welfare science can be considered as the assessment of welfare. The first publication to include the term \\"assessment\\" appears to be a 1965 appendix by William Homan Thorpe entitled The assessment of pain and distress in animals.Thorpe, W.H., (1965). The assessment of pain and distress in animals. Appendix III in the report of the technical committee to enquire into the welfare of animals kept under intensive husbandry conditions, F.W.R. Brambell (chairman). H.M.S.O., London This was followed 20 years later by a highly influential paper on assessing pain and distress in laboratory animals by Morton and Griffiths. Methods of assessment Animal welfare science uses a variety of behavioural or physiological measures or indicators. Integrated approaches to assess animal welfare include risk analysis and semantic modelling of animal welfare. =Animal behaviour= *Occurrence of abnormal behaviours (e.g. stereotypies, feather pecking, tail-biting, facial expressions) *Departure from ethogram of ancestral precursors *Intra-specific variations in behavioural welfare indices *Behaviour of captive animals upon release in a natural environment *Preference studies *Motivation studies *Cognitive bias in animals studies *Self selection of anxiolytics *Effects of frustration =Animal physiology= *Heart rate *Heart rate variability *Corticosteroids in plasma, saliva, urine, faeces, hair, feathers and eggs *Immune function *NeuorobiologyLewis M.H., Presti M.F., Lewis J.B. and Turner, C.A. (2006). The neurobiology of stereotypy I: Environmental complexity. In Stereotypic Animal Behaviour: Fundamentals and Applications to Welfare, G. Mason and J. Rushen (Editors). CABI pp. 190-226. *Eggshell quality *Thermography including eye surface temperature Organisations Organisations interested in animal welfare science were set up before the subject became recognised as a science. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) was founded in 1824 by a group of twenty-two reformers led by Richard Martin MP (who would thereby earn the nickname Humanity Dick), William Wilberforce MP and the Reverend Arthur Broome. The Universities Federation for Animal Welfare (UFAW) history can be traced to the founding in 1926 of the University of London Animal Welfare Society (ULAWS) by Major Charles Hume. The name was changed to the Universities Federation for Animal Welfare in 1938, reflecting the increasingly wide range of people and institutions involved. More recent organisations involved in animal welfare science include the Scientists Center for Animal Welfare (SCAW) and university departments specialising in this branch of science including the Animal Welfare and Anthrozoology Center at Cambridge University, the Animal Welfare Science Centre at The University of Melbourne in Australia and the Animal Welfare Science and Bioethics Centre at Massey University in New Zealand. Although not limited to animal welfare science, many members of the International Society for Applied Ethology work and publish research in this subject. Journals, articles and books Veterinary journals carrying articles on animal welfare have been published for many years, for example, the Veterinary Record has been published weekly since 1888. Peer-reviewed scientific journals have been launched more recently, e.g. Applied Animal Behaviour Science in 1974, Animal Welfare in 1992, the Journal of Applied Animal Welfare Science in 1998, and Frontiers in Veterinary Science‚ÄîAnimal Behavior and Welfare in 2014. Many books on animal welfare science have been written, for example those by Professor Marian Stamp Dawkins,Dawkins, M.S., (1980). Animal Suffering: The Science of Animal Welfare.

UFAW/Wiley-Blackwell Teaching In 2011 in an article on the history of animal welfare science, Donald Broom wrote \\"The numbers of animal welfare scientists is increasing rapidly. The subject is now being taught in all European countries and the number of university courses on animal welfare in Brazil has increased from one to over 60 in 15 years. The diversity of animal welfare science is increasing and the expansion is likely to continue. The decision by the American Veterinary Medical Association to promote the teaching of the subject in all American veterinary schools will have a substantial effect.\\" See also * Animal welfare * Animal consciousness * Fish welfare at slaughter * Pain in amphibians * Pain in animals * Pain in crustaceans * Pain in fish * Pain in invertebrates * Welfare biology * Wild animal suffering References Further references * Broom, D.M.

Held due to the death of Antonio Abaya, Giorgidi Aggabao won the special election, beating Abaya's widow Asuncion, to succeed him in the House of Representatives. Campaign Representative Antonio Abaya, who had represented the Isabela's 4th legislative district from 1987 to 1998, and since 2001, died on February 26, 2003. Abaya, who was term-limited in 1998, ran for mayor of Santiago but was beaten. He ran again for the seat (that includes Santiago) in 2001 and won. As the Isabela Provincial Board passed the resolution urging the special election to be held, three people had been brought up as potential candidates. However, only Santiago mayor Jose Miranda (PDP‚ÄìLaban) had declared his intention to run, relying on the support of Santiago and three other towns. Other potential candidates were former board member Giorgidi Aggabao, who had been beaten by Abaya in 2001 and was backed by Isabela governor Faustino Dy, Jr., and Asuncion Abaya, the late representative's widow, who is a medical doctor. Later on, Miranda withdrew in favor of Dr. Abaya, who was considered to be the \\"sentimental favorite\\". Miranda's city of Santiago, the largest of the seven local government units in the district with about 60,000 votes, was expected to be the strongest source of votes for her. The mayors of the other towns all supported Aggabao, along with the Dy clan headed by the provincial governor. Result On election day, people handling Miranda's security were shot by unidentified men riding in motorcycles. The incident was described by the city election officer as \\"election-related.\\" Other disturbances included the confrontation of Cordon Mayor Amado Vallejo, Jr. of two lawyers of the Abaya campaign who allegedly harassed poll watchers. According to unofficial counts, the towns of Echague, Cordon and Ramon all went to Aggabao, while Santiago went for Abaya, with Aggabao possessing a large overall margin. On May 14, 2003, Aggabao was declared winner by the Commission on Elections (COMELEC). While the votes were being canvassed, Abaya's lawyers protested the process by walking out of the canvassing room. They alleged that some ballot boxes were switched on the trip from the polling places to the provincial capital of Ilagan. The Abayas held their own canvassing at the People's Coliseum in Santiago, with Edwin Uy, the 2nd district representative, attending. The official results had Aggabao winning at Cordon, San Isidro, Jones, San Agustin, Ramon and Echague. Abaya won at Santiago by around 5,000 votes and at Dinapigue by 62 votes. Aggabao was sworn into office by Governor Dy right after his proclamation. The tally of the Parish Pastoral Council for Responsible Voting (PPCRV), a COMELEC-accredited watchdog, and Abaya's camp had Abaya winning by 4,969 votes. Abaya had 46,072 votes while Aggabao had 41,103 votes. Aggabao brushed off the accusations, saying that he did not raise a fuss when he was beaten in 1991 and 2001. Aftermath Ilagan Bishop Sergio Utleg later issued a pastoral letter alleging the special election was the province's \\"most fraudulent\\". The pastoral letter was condemned by the isabela Provincial Board to the \\"strongest terms\\" and demanded that the bishop reconsider it. The bishop said, \\"My pastoral letter, contrary to the claim of the provincial board members, was based on verified facts and testimonies of people involved in the special elections,\\" and reiterated for the nullification of the election results. Election officers of San Isidro and San Agustin claimed that Abaya won in their towns, with San Isidro's vote count for Aggabao surpassing the number of votes cast. COMELEC Chairmen Benjamin Abalos had formed a task force to investigate the alleged irregularities of the vote. By 2013, Aggabao was in his third term in Congress, after losing to Miranda's brother Anthony in 2004; he won in 2007, and successfully defended his seat on the 2010 and 2013 election. Term-limited in 2016, his wife ran and won, defending the seat. Isabela was redistricted in time for the 2019 election, and Aggabao himself was defeated by newcomer Alyssa Sheena Tan.

The type species, C. paulistanus, was named in 2011. A second species, C. montealtensis, was referred to Caipirasuchus in 2013 after having been named in 2008 as a species of Sphagesaurus. A third species, C. stenognathus, was described in 2014. A fourth species, C. minerius, was described in 2018. Discovery and naming Mandibular symphysis of the first three named species Caipirasuchus was first named by Fabiano V. Iori and Ismar S. Carvalho in 2011 and the type species is C. paulistanus. The generic name is derived from Portuguese word Caipira which refers to the rural inhabitants of the Brazilian states, covering almost all of the Bauru Basin, and Greek souchus meaning \\"crocodile\\". The specific name is derived from \\"paulista\\", the designation for the residents of S√£o Paulo State, where the holotype was found. C. paulistanus is known only from the holotype specimen MPMA 67-0001/00, an almost complete and undeformed skull and mandible with teeth (only three teeth are missing) and partial postcranium from a single individual. It was found on the S√£o Francisco Farm, in Homem de Mello, the rural area of Monte Alto County of northern S√£o Paulo. It was collected from the Adamantina Formation of the Bauru Basin, which dates to the Turonian and Santonian stages of the Late Cretaceous. A second species, C. montealtensis, was named by Marco Brandalise de Andrade and Reinaldo J. Bertini in 2008 as a species of the closely related notosuchian genus Sphagesaurus, on the basis of MPMA 15-001/90, a nearly complete skull and mandible preserved in occlusion. It was collected from the Bairro Cachoeira locality at the base of the Serra da √Ågua Limpa, about 8 km northwest of Monte Alto, from the Adamantina Formation. In 2013, this specimen was reassigned to Caipirasuchus on the basis of a newly discovered specimen referrable to it. MPMA 68-0003/12 consists of a nearly complete cranium and mandible, and a posterior portion of the post-cranium. It was discovered in the municipality of Catanduva, northern S√£o Paulo, from the Adamantina Formation. At least five synapomorphies unite the species, and a phylogenetic analysis found them to be sister taxa. Description Mandible of C. stenognathus C. paulistanus has about ten autapomorphies or unique characteristics. The external naris (the nostril opening in the skull) is bordered only by the premaxillae bones. Each premaxilla has four teeth set into it. There is a gap called a diastema in the premaxillary tooth row, and a diastema in between the premaxillary and maxillary teeth. The dentary bone of the lower jaw has ten teeth on either side, with two diastemata separating them. The forward-most teeth are suited for capturing food, while the back teeth are adapted for food processing. The palatine bone in the roof of the mouth connects to the maxilla bone of the snout by a region of bone called the cuneiform process. Caipirasuchus also has large pterygoid and ectopterygoid bones and a well-developed hole in front of the eye sockets called the antorbital fenestra.

Taxonomy The holotype MSNTUP I-15459 of Aegyptocetus tarfa Aegyptocetus is known from the articulated holotype MSNTUP I-15459, an almost complete cranium, lower jaws (with teeth) and a partial postcranial skeleton (cervical and thoracic vertebrae and ribs). The specimen was recovered when marbleized limestone was imported commercially to Italy. It was collected in the Khashm el-Raqaba limestone quarry (, paleocoordinates ) from the Gebel Hof Formation on the northern flank of Wadi Tarfa in the Eastern Desert of Egypt, dating to the late Mokattamian age of the middle Eocene, about . Its cause of death may have been an attack by a large shark as pattern of shark tooth marks preserved on the ribs. Aegyptocetus was first named by Giovanni Bianucci and Philip D. Gingerich in 2011 and the type species is Aegyptocetus tarfa. The generic name is derived from Aegyptus, Latin for Egypt, and cetus, Latin for whale. The specific name refers to Wadi Tarfa, the desert valley where the holotype was found. Description Restoration of Aegyptocetus and a shark Aegyptocetus had features in its cranium and dentaries adapted for hearing in water. Its thoracic vertebrae (T1‚ÄìT8), however, had long neural spines which is a characteristic of the weight-bearing system of land-living mammals retained in protocetids, such as Rodhocetus and Qaisracetus, but absent in the more derived basilosaurids, such as Dorudon. This suggests that Aegyptocetus, like other protocetids, was able to support its body on land and probably was semi-aquatic.

Early life Iris ter Schiphorst was born in Hamburg into a middle-class family, her father a Dutch technician and her mother a German pianist. She describes music as her \\"second mother tongue\\" (\\"zweite Muttersprache\\").Iris ter Schiphorst und Helmut Oehring: Dokumentation der Zusammenarbeit ‚Äì Biografien, Werke, Presse, Projekte (Berlin: Boosey & Hawkes, 2002), p. 1. She began taking piano lessons, initially from her mother, after her early hopes of becoming a dancer were thwarted by injury. She continued her piano studies at the Bremen Musikhochschule from 1973 to 1978, and embarked on a busy schedule of concert performances. She then spent two years (1978‚Äì1980) travelling in Europe and Africa, an experience that transformed her social and musical outlook. On returning to Germany she began playing in rock bands, including Bremen's all- female Seven Kick the Can. She remained active in rock music from 1980 to 1986, as keyboardist, bassist, drummer, and sound engineer. ter Schiphorst moved to Berlin in 1984 and from 1986 studied humanities (theatre studies, cultural studies, and philosophy) at the Freie Universit√§t Berlin, later transferring to Humboldt-Universit√§t. She also attended seminars with composers Dieter Schnebel and Luigi Nono and musicologist Helga de la Motte- Haber, but is otherwise self-taught in composition. Composing career Iris ter Schiphorst ter Schiphorst's experience as a practising musician has been an important influence on her approach to composition. Her music is also informed by her abiding interest in dance.London Sinfonietta and Iris ter Schiphorst , video interview first screened at the United Kingdom premiere of Zerst√∂ren (2005/2006) by the London Sinfonietta, Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 5 November 2011; web version accessed 16 December 2011. She began experimenting with classical composition in the 1980s while still playing in rock bands. Early works include Terrible (1982) and Postludium aus Vergessenem (1985). Later in the decade she co-founded the zeit-Musik collective of composers and musicologists, and concentrated on music exploring the relationship between text and sound. Works from this period include the radio pieces Inside-outside II (1989) and Und was, wenn die Schlange ein Schwein gewesen w√§re? (1989). Her interest in electronic music and sampling techniques led her to form the electro-acoustic ensemble Intrors in 1990, with whom she won the Blaue Br√ºcke composition competition in 1997 for Silence Moves (1997; with Helmut Oehring) and made two recordings, Liebesgeschw√ºre im Schneckenhaus (1992) and Silence Moves und Anna's Wake (1999). She performed with Intrors on keyboards, synthesiser, and sampler through the 1990s, as well as continuing to give piano concerts. At the same time, ter Schiphorst was developing an interest in writing for stage and multimedia performance. 1055, die Welt ist noch in Ordnung (1984) is an early example, but it was only in the nineties that this became a large part of her output, beginning with Strings (1991), Anna's Wake, and Z.B. Herz (both 1992). In 1996 she formed a composing partnership with her sometime companion Helmut Oehring,See also Helmut Oehring's website (in English and German), accessed 1 December 2011. which lasted until 2001: \\"Their joint creative activities were inaugurated in 1996 when Oehring asked to use melodic material by Schiphorst in his dance-opera The D‚ÄôAmato System, premiered at the Munich Biennale. They then experimented with wholesale co-composition in the highly successful Polaroids, which was given its first performance by Ensemble Modern the same year.\\"\\"Requiem in Tandem\\" (February 1999), reproduced at ter Schiphorst's website, accessed 8 November 2011. ter Schiphorst wrote little music under her own name during this period as she focused on collaborative composition and caring for her son. If frequency of performance is any guide, Live: aus Androgyn (1997) is proving to be the most durable of the couple's collaborations.The Boosey & Hawkes Performance Database lists twenty-eight complete performances between April 1997 and January 2012; accessed 24 December 2011. The piece has also been recorded twice; see Discography. One work ter Schiphorst did produce independently in the late 1990s, and a significant milestone, was her first composition for full orchestra, Hundert Komma Null (1999). It was commissioned by Musica Viva M√ºnchen and shortlisted for the 2001 Prix Italia. This was followed by Gestures (2001), and a succession of compositions that demonstrate her increasing assurance and maturity. Recent works such as Die G√§nsemagd (2009), Klangr√§tsel (2010), Gr√ºffelo (2011), and S.O.S. Odysseus (2012‚Äì2013; with Uros Rojko) reflect ter Schiphorst's interest in bringing the language of contemporary music to young performers and listeners.

Historically speaking, many of these Chinatowns were formed in the 1800s Chinese diaspora and have served as ethnic Chinese enclaves. History Chinatowns in the United States have historically been located in the \\"big cities\\" such as New York City, San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Chicago and existed initially as enclaves that ease transition into the American culture. The earliest Chinatowns tended to be on the west coast while the newer ones are being built in lesser profile cities as opportunities shift. As the migration trends toward returning to China, many Chinatowns, especially smaller ones like the one in Washington DC, begin to lose their initial mission. Today, many urban Chinatowns in the United States are becoming visitor centers rather than serving as the ethnic enclaves they once were, although the rapidly growing satellite New York City Chinatowns in the boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn on Long Island represent a stark exception to this trend in North America, fueled by continuing robust levels of large- scale immigration from mainland China specifically directed toward New York. The significant timeline is as follows: * 1840s‚Äì1860s ‚Äì Many initial Chinatowns developed in the west spurred by the California Gold Rush and the Transcontinental railroad, such as San Francisco's Chinatown. * 1863 ‚Äì Emancipation Proclamation opens up new opportunities for Chinese in the Southern United States * 1860s, 1870s, 1880s ‚Äì racial tensions, labor tensions, leads to incidents such as the Rock Springs Massacre * 1882‚Äì1943 ‚Äì Chinese Exclusion Act was in effect, banning Chinese immigration into the United States. * 1943 ‚Äì Repeal of Chinese Exclusion Act, Chinatown populations start to rise again. * 1970s ‚Äì end of Vietnam War * 2010s ‚Äì Downturn of US. economy, China economy rises, causes reverse migration, and decay of Chinatowns Demographics Historically, most Chinatowns started as enclaves of ethnic Chinese people. Many of these Chinatowns have experienced gentrification as the demographics shifted. While some Chinatowns have retained their status as the ethnic Chinese enclave, many of them have lost that status. The cities with the ten highest Chinese American populations, with New York City comprising over half of the combined total, according to the 2015 American Community Survey, were as follows: # New York City (549,181) # San Francisco (179,644) # Los Angeles (77,284) #* San Gabriel Valley core cities and CDPs (additional 225,543) #** Alhambra, Arcadia, Diamond Bar, El Monte, Hacienda Heights, Monterey Park, Rosemead, Rowland Heights, San Gabriel, Temple City, Walnut, West Covina # San Jose (72,141) # Honolulu (53,119) # Chicago (51,809) # San Diego (40,033) # Philadelphia (35,732) # Oakland (33,818) # Houston (32,968) Arizona =Phoenix= Phoenix, Arizona once had a Chinatown that was started in the 1870s and lasted until the 1940s with the general population scattering throughout the city thereafter. Sources from a research project indicated that more than one Chinatown existed in the city of Phoenix, with one around First Street and Madison and a second at First and Adams Street in the present location of the Talking Stick Resort Arena. California Given its relative proximity to East Asia and Southeast Asia, California has the largest number of Chinese among the American states, including the well-known Chinatown in San Francisco, an all-Chinese town of Locke built by Chinese immigrants, and Chinatowns in various cities throughout the state. =Eureka= There was a Chinatown in Eureka, which was established around the 1880s. The district spanned one block at Fourth and E streets. =Fresno= Fresno still has a neighborhood officially called Chinatown, near downtown. However, most of its Chinese businesses and architecture are gone. The neighborhood had a vibrant Chinese community in the early 1900s. =Greater Los Angeles Area= The entrance arch at the Los Angeles's Chinatown Hilton Square in San Gabriel, California Atlantic Times Square in Monterey Park, California Los Angeles In the city of Los Angeles proper, the old inner-city Chinatown was built during the late 1930s‚Äìthe second Chinatown to be constructed in Los Angeles. Formerly a \\"Little Italy,\\" it is presently located along Hill Street, Broadway and Spring Street near Dodger Stadium in downtown Los Angeles with restaurants, grocers, and tourist- oriented shops and plazas. A sculpture of dueling gold dragons spans Broadway and marks the entrance to Chinatown with a statue honoring the Kuomintang founder Dr. Sun Yat-sen adorning the northeast section. The enclave contains Buddhist temples, Chinese Christian church (with services conducted in Cantonese), and a temple devoted to the Chinese Goddess of the Sea. Chinatown is home to family and regional associations and general service organizations for long time immigrants (called in Cantonese: ; Jyutping: lou5 waa4 kiu4) as well as ones founded by and for a second wave of Indochina-born immigrants after the Vietnam War ended. San Gabriel Valley The San Gabriel Valley in the eastern suburbs of Los Angeles is home to the U.S.'s first suburban Chinatown (in Monterey Park, California) according to the Los Angeles Times and is now one of the Chinese enclaves in the San Gabriel Valley.Reckard, E. Scott and Khouri, Andrew (March 24, 2014) \\"Wealthy Chinese home buyers boost suburban L.A. housing markets\\" Los Angeles Times According to the same source, starting in 1977, Frederic Hsieh bought up multiple properties in an effort to create what he described would be a \\"mecca for Chinese\\". Timothy Fong wrote an entire book that documents the history in the transforming of Monterey Park from an ordinary suburb to a Chinatown. Samuel Ho further documents that Monterey Park falls into the \\"new Chinatown\\" category with Houston specifically cited as an example from which it follows. There is now approximately 15 local cities and communities with Chinese plurality: Alhambra, Arcadia, Diamond Bar, East San Gabriel, Hacienda Heights, Mayflower Village, Monterey Park, North El Monte, Rosemead, Rowland Heights, San Gabriel, San Marino, South San Gabriel, Temple City, Walnut. Irvine Irvine is a growing suburban Chinatown in Orange County as more Chinese are expanding out of the San Gabriel Valley. Many Chinese business establishments situated in the El Camino Real and Walnut neighborhoods. Ventura Ventura had a flourishing Chinese settlement in the early 1880s. The largest concentration of activity, known as China Alley, was just across Main Street from the Mission San Buenaventura. China Alley was parallel with Main Street and extended easterly off Figueroa Street between Main and Santa Clara Streets.Landmark #91: China Alley Historic Area accessed 26 March 2014 from link on City Map with Historic Landmarks The city council has designated the China Alley Historic Area a Point of Interest in the downtown business district.Resolution 99-3 of the City Council adopted and passed January 11, 1999 =Locke= The Sacramento River delta town of Locke was built in 1915 as a distinct rural Chinese enclave. A thriving agricultural community in the early 20th century, it is now largely uninhabited by Chinese-Americans. A historic district of 50 wood-frame buildings along Main Street, Key Street and River Road was designated a historic district in 1990. =Sacramento= Paifang at Sacramento's Chinatown Mall Throughout the early 1840s and 1850s, China was at war with Great Britain and France in the First and Second Opium Wars. The wars, along with endemic poverty in China, helped drive many Chinese immigrants to America. Many first came to San Francisco, which was then the largest city in California, which was known as \\"Dai Fow\\" (The Big City) and some came eventually to Sacramento (then the second-largest city in California), which is known as \\"Yee Fow\\" (Second City). Many of these immigrants came in hopes for a better life as well as the possibility of finding gold in the foothills east of Sacramento. Sacramento's Chinatown was located on \\"I\\" Street from Second to Sixth Streets. At the time this area of \\"I\\" Street was considered a health hazard as, lying within a levee zone it was lower than other parts of the city which were situated on higher land. Throughout Sacramento's Chinatown history there were fires, acts of discrimination, and prejudicial legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act that was not repealed until 1943. The mysterious fires were thought to be set off by those who did not take a liking to the Chinese working class. Ordinances on what was viable building material were set into place to try to get the Chinese to move out. Newspapers such as The Sacramento Union, at the time, wrote stories that portrayed the Chinese in an unfavorable light to inspire ethnic discrimination and drive the Chinese away. As the years passed, a railroad was created over parts of the Chinatown and further politics and laws would make it even harder for Chinese workers to sustain a living in Sacramento. While the east side of the country fought for higher wages and fewer working hours, many cities in the western United States wanted the Chinese out because of the belief that they were stealing jobs from the white working class. =Salinas= In the 1880s, farm labor in Salinas was done by many Chinese immigrants. Salinas boasted the second largest Chinatown in the state, slightly smaller than San Francisco.\\"10,000 Years on the Salinas Plain\\" by Gary S. Breschini, Mona Gudgel, & Trudy Haversat =San Diego= San Diego's Chinatown was founded in the 1870s around Market Street and Third Avenue, but faded quickly after World War Two. In 1987, due to its historic and cultural value, the city council of San Diego sought to preserve the area and officially designated it the Asian Pacific Thematic Historic District, which partially overlaps the burgeoning and gentrified Gaslamp Quarter Historic District (the center of the San Diego's trendy nightlife scene). The annual San Diego Chinese New Year Food and Cultural Faire is presented in this particular district, and the San Diego Chinese Heritage Museum is located here. =San Francisco Bay Area= San Francisco Distinctive Chinese- style architecture characterizes the streets of San Francisco's historic Chinatown, one of the oldest and largest in the United States. Arch at San Francisco's Chinatown The first, and one of the largest, most prominent and highly visited Chinatowns in the Americas is San Francisco's Chinatown. Founded in 1848, Chinatown was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and was later rebuilt and re-realized, using a Chinese-style architecture that has been criticized as garish and touristy. For many years a center of tong wars and later gang activism, Chinatown is now much safer than it was in years past. Chinatown receives millions of tourists annually, making the community, along with Alcatraz and Golden Gate Bridge, one of the prime attractions and highlights of the city of San Francisco, as well as the centerpiece of Chinese-American history. Besides the main thoroughfare of Grant Avenue and various side streets, Chinatown has several side alleys, including Ross Alley. Contained within this alley is a mix of touristy stores, tiny barber shop, as well as a fortune cookie factory. Ross Alley used to have brothels, but they no longer exist. Also within the confines of Chinatown is the Woh Hei Yuen Recreation Center and Park on Powell Street. The San Francisco Chinatown hosts the largest Chinese New Year parade in the Americas, with corporate sponsors such as the Bank of America and the award-winning and widely praised dragon dance team from the San Francisco Police Department, composed solely of Chinese-American SFPD officers (the only such team in existence in the United States). In its founding, it received the grant from the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, otherwise known as the Chinese Six Companies. As Chinatown and many Chinese-Americans in the San Francisco Bay Area have historical or current roots in province of Guangdong, China (particularly Taishan County) and in Hong Kong, these dances mostly are performed in the southern Chinese style. San Francisco's Chinatown is also the birthplace of chop suey and many other dishes of American Chinese cuisine. With its Chinatown as the landmark, the city of San Francisco itself has one of the largest and predominant concentrations of Chinese-American population centers, representing 20% of total population as of the 2000 Census, Though Chinatown remains the cultural and symbolic anchor of the Bay Area Chinese community, increasing numbers of Chinese-Americans do not live there, instead residing in Chinese enclaves in the Richmond and Sunset districts, or elsewhere in the Bay Area. Oakland Chinatown, Oakland Oakland's Chinatown is frequently referred to as \\"Oakland Chinatown\\" in order to distinguish it from nearby San Francisco's Chinatown. Originally formed in the 1860s, the Chinatown of Oakland ‚Äì centering upon 8th Street and Webster Street ‚Äì shares a long history as its counterpart in the city of San Francisco as Oakland's community remains one of the focal point of Chinese American heritage in the San Francisco Bay Area. However, the major difference with San Francisco's Chinatown is that Oakland's version is not as touristy, as its local economy tends not to rely on tourism as much. But the local government of Oakland has since promoted it as such as it is considered one of the top sources of sales tax revenue for the city. The Chinatown does not have an ornamental entrance arch (paifang) but the streets of the community are adorned with road signs in English with Chinese rendering. Today, while it remains a Cantonese-speaking enclave, it is not exclusively Chinese anymore, but more of a pan-Asian neighborhood which reflects Oakland's diversity of Asian communities, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Filipinos, Japanese, Cambodian, Laotian, Mien, Thai, and others. In addition to the standard Chinese New Year festivities, the Oakland Chinatown Streetfest (held by the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce) is also held yearly in August and it features Chinese lion dances, parades, music, cooking demonstrations and contests, a food festival, and various activities. Napa Napa had a Chinatown that was established in the mid-1800s, located on First Street. It had 300 residents, and many of its residents provided manual labor in the area. San Jose San Jose was home to five Chinatowns that existed until the 1930s. The initial Chinatowns in San Jose were frequently burned down by arson, with artifacts from May 1887 recently discovered around the San Jose Institute of Contemporary Art, which is located at 560 South 1st Street. Another Chinatown was excavated during an urban renewal project to build the Fairmont Hotel and Silicon Valley Financial Center on Market and San Fernando Streets. According to another article, this Chinatown was also known as the \\"Plaza Street Chinatown\\", which grew rapidly from the 1860s to the 1870s and was home to \\"... several hundred Chinese.\\" According to this article, the area at the time was subject to controversy as many whites often complained to the city council about the area as \\"bothersome\\". By 1870, the area was burned to the ground with many Chinese evicted from the area as the anti-Chinese public sentiment grew. Later in history, John Heinlen, a farmer and businessman, planned a six block Chinatown with brick structures with water and pipes in the area of Sixth Street and Cleveland Street in 1887, to the dismay of the non-Chinese public and caused public outrage. The area was then known as \\"Heinlenville\\" and contained a variety of merchants, barbers, traditional doctors, and Chinese herbal medicine. and the Ng Shing Gung temple. The area was surrounded by Little Italy and co-existed harmoniously, but then dwindled in the 1920s as the younger generations sought careers outside the area and with a lack of new Chinese coming in due to the Chinese Exclusion Act, the area lost almost all of its Chinese population. Some artifacts from this Chinatown are now located in Kelley Park. At the time, an existing Japantown nearby was evacuated due to the war, but was repopulated after the internment of the Japanese-Americans. Santa Rosa There was a Chinatown in Santa Rosa, present in the early 1900s, and was removed afterward. It was located on Second and Third Streets, near Santa Rosa Avenue, in downtown Santa Rosa. The district had around 200 residents. =Stockton= Stockton, California is home to a small Chinatown on Chung Wah Lane, East Market Street and East Washington Street. In 1906, Stockton's Chinatown \\"... had the largest Chinatown in California with over 5,000 inhabitants...\\" due in large part to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake that caused a \\"... swelling [of] the Chinese population in Stockton.\\" On Lock Sam, the city's oldest restaurant was founded in 1898. The community was once quite large but, after development in the 1950s and 1960s and the construction of the Crosstown freeway, businesses moved, buildings were demolished, new buildings were built, and the community changed forever. There is still a Chinese New Year Parade merged with the Vietnamese New Year celebrations. Colorado =Denver= Chinatown in Denver, Colorado, was a neighborhood on Wazee Street in what is now the \\"LoDo section of the city....\\" The first recorded Chinese person was of a man from southern China named \\"John\\" dated June 29, 1869, as documented by the Colorado Tribune. It was also referred to as \\"Hop Alley\\" and it was torn apart by riots in the 1880s. A St. Louis newspaper dated November 1, 1880 documented the complete destruction of the neighborhood as \\"Chinatown Gutted by Murderous Scoundrels\\". Connecticut =Norwich and Montville= The development of the Mohegan Sun casino has caused major demographic changes to the surrounding communities of Montville and Norwich. After the attacks of 9/11 led to a loss of garment and service jobs in Manhattan Chinatown, many residents relocated to work in the then-new Connecticut casino and developed an \\"unexpected\\" Chinatown in the vicinity, though the area is not officially labeled as such. Some neighborhoods have transformed from low density \\"suburban\\" to higher density occupancy, with underused rooms and spaces in single-family houses converted to house as many as 12 people. Also, many of Chinese descent grow vegetables in the front yard, a practice considered unacceptable to some pre-existing demographics, with some incidents sparking racial tensions. District of Columbia Chinatown in Washington, D.C. is a small, historical neighborhood east of downtown consisting of about 20 ethnic Chinese and other Asian restaurants and small businesses along H and I Streets between 5th and 8th Streets, Northwest. It is known for its annual Chinese New Year festival and parade and the Friendship Arch, a Chinese gate built over H Street at 7th Street. Other nearby prominent landmarks include the Verizon Center, a sports and entertainment arena, and the Old Patent Office Building, which houses two of the Smithsonian museums (the National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum). The neighborhood is served by the Gallery Place-Chinatown station of the Washington Metro.\\"History of Washington DC -Chinatown\\" Chinatown Community Cultural Center Retrieved 12 December 2014 Hawaii =Honolulu= The Wo Fat Building in the Chinatown district of Honolulu. The official historical and present Chinatown of Honolulu, on North Hotel Street and Maunakea Street, contains traditional ethnic Chinese businesses. Unlike Chinatowns in the continental United States which were largely pioneered and dominated by Taishan immigrants, Honolulu's Chinatown was started by early settlers from Zhongshan, Guangdong Province in the 1890s. They migrated to Hawaii for work in the island's cane sugar plantations as well as rice fields and then as they became successful eventually relocating to the city of Honolulu. As with other Chinatowns in the United States, it was noted for its unsanitary conditions. In the 1940s, it degenerated into a red-light district. Today, it is also diverse with Pan-Asian and Pacific Islander businesses and the ethnic Chinese from Vietnam are largely demographically represented in Honolulu's Chinatown. Businesses include markets, bakeries, a Chinese porcelain shop, and shops specializing with ginseng herbal remedies. In Chinatown, there are also bazaars and street peddlers in the Kekaulike Mall (located on Kekaulike Street) bringing it unique bustling ambiance to the community. The variety of restaurants serving Hong Kong-style dim sum and others in Vietnamese beef noodle soup are frequent in Chinatown. The history of Chinese revolutionary Sun Yat-sen ‚Äì from the Zhongshan region of Guangdong province of China ‚Äì is tied to Hawaii, having receiving his Western education there. Chinatown, Honolulu was once served as the base of operations in a series of crusades against ruling Qing Dynasty in China that culminate in the Revolution of 1911. There is a monument in his honor in Honolulu's Chinatown. Recent development and planning has dramatically transformed the once decaying and unsafe neighborhood to an upscale Asian inspired arts district blended with the traditional Chinese bazaars and family owned stores. Illinois =Chicago= Chicago's Chinatown The Chinatown in Chicago is a traditional urban ethnic enclave, occupying a large portion of the Armour Square region on the city's near south side. The intersection of Wentworth Avenue at Cermak Road is the neighborhood's historic epicenter. Chinatown has historically been dominated by Chinese-American commercial interests, though in recent years, large-scale construction of residential developments, particularly east of Canal Streets and the area adjacent Ping Tom Park south of W.18th Street, have exponentially increased the number of residents in the area. While it is a cultural tourist attraction for visitors, Chinatown also attracts Chinese emigrants hailing from China as a gateway neighborhood. The annual Chinese New Year and Chinese Double Ten Day Parade are both held in Chinatown. Louisiana =New Orleans= Former On Leong Merchant Association Building, 530 Bourbon Street, New Orleans, Louisiana New Orleans was once home to one of the largest Chinatowns in the Southern United States. The first significant migration of Chinese to Louisiana took place during Reconstruction after the American Civil War, between 1867 and 1871, when local planters imported hundreds of Cantonese contract laborers from Cuba, California, and directly from China as a low-cost replacement for slave labor. By the mid-1870s, nearly all of these laborers had abandoned the plantations and migrated to the cities of the South, especially New Orleans, in search of higher pay and better working conditions. They were followed by Chinese merchants from California and other states, who supplied the laborers, imported tea and other luxury goods to the Port of Orleans, and exported cotton and dried shrimp to China. By the 1880s, these merchants had developed a small Chinatown on the 1100 block of Tulane Avenue, between Elk Place and South Rampart Street, near the modern Tulane stop on the North Rampart Streetcar line. Though much smaller than the Chinatowns of the West Coast or the industrial cities of the north, New Orleans Chinatown was the site of several dry goods groceries, import/export companies, apothecaries, restaurants, laundries, and the meeting halls of several Chinese associations. Chinatown continued to exist for six decades, until its destruction by WPA re-development in 1937, during the Great Depression. Several office towers stand on the site of the former Tulane Avenue Chinatown. A few Chinese businesses attempted to build a second Chinatown on the 500-block of Bourbon Street, but this smaller Chinatown also died out over the next thirty years. Today, only the former meeting hall of the On Leong Merchants Association still remains on 530 Bourbon Street. Maine =Portland= Chinatown in the U.S. city of Portland, Maine once existed around Monument Square and traversed mostly on Congress Street. The first Chinese person arrived in 1858 with the Chinatown forming around 1916 until around 1953. The last vestiges of Chinatown lingered until 1997 when the last Chinese laundry closed and all buildings demolished by then through urban renewal. Portland's Chinatown existed modestly with most Chinese being isolated due to discriminate and the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. By 1895, there were enough Chinese people that a Chinese community began to form, though mostly with men whose wives were prohibited from migration by the newly created law. The community celebrated their first Chinese New Year that year (1895). By 1920, around 30 Chinese laundries existed in the city. In 1903, a union formed to fix prices for laundromats and consisted of around 100 people who owned the laundries. By around the 1950s, the Chinese community had shrunk to the point that Chinatown almost ceased to exist. By 1997, the last laundry was demolished wiping out the last remaining vestige of Chinatown. Most Chinese men who lived in Chinatown attended a Chinese American church with some going to China as missionaries. Maryland =Baltimore= The On Leong Building in Baltimore's Chinatown Baltimore, Maryland was home to a small Chinatown. Historically, Baltimore had at least two districts that were called \\"Chinatown\\" where the first one existed on the 200 block of Marion Street ring the 1880s. A second and current location is at the 300 block of Park Ave., which was dominated by laundries and restaurants. The initial Chinese population came because of the transcontinental railroad, however, the Chinese population never exceeded 400 as of 1941. During segregation, Chinese children were classified as \\"white\\" and went to the white schools. Chinatown was largely gone by the First World War due to urban renewal. Though Chinatown was largely spared from the riots of the 1960s, most of the Chinese residents moved to the suburbs. As of 2009, the area still shows signs of blight and does not have a Chinese arch. =Rockville, Potomac, and North Potomac= Rockville, in addition to North Potomac with a 27.59% Asian population and Potomac with close to 15%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Rockville is home to one of the largest Chinese communities in Maryland According to the U.S. Census conducted in 2000, 14.5% of North Potomac's residents identified themselves as being of Chinese ancestry, making North Potomac the area with the highest percentage of Chinese ancestry in any place besides California and Hawaii. According to the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) enrollment demographic statistics, the two high schools in Montgomery County with the highest reported Asian ancestry are Thomas S. Wootton High School in Rockville, MD with a 32.1% Asian population and caters to the communities in North Potomac, Rockville, and Potomac, MD, and Winston Churchill High School in Potomac, MD with a 23.0% Asian population. Although North Potomac and Potomac have the highest concentration of Asian population in Maryland, the areas are largely residential and consist of suburban subdivisions. Thus, the more commercially favorable Rockville has become the center for Chinese/Taiwanese businesses since it is the county seat of Montgomery County and has large economic activity along Rockville Pike/Wisconsin Avenue (MD Route 355) in addition to having its own middle class and upscale residential areas. Rockville is widely considered to be a \\"Little Taipei\\" due to the area's high concentration of Taiwanese immigrants. Although it is considered a satellite of the Washington, D.C., Chinatown, Phuong Ly wrote in the Washington Post that the Montgomery County Chinatown is the \\"real Chinatown\\". According to the article, Rockville's Chinatown spans along Rockville Pike from Halpine Road to East Jefferson Street, along E Jefferson Street and then along North Washington Street. Close to 30,000 people of Chinese descent live in Montgomery County, most of whom were drawn to the \\"good schools\\" and is home to at least three Chinese newspapers. Cynthia Hacinli states that \\"fans of authentic Chinese food\\" come here instead of the downtown Chinatown on H Street. After the riots of 1968, many Chinese sought refuge in the suburbs of Maryland and Virginia, thus starting the decline of the H Street Chinatown. According to another article, the largest concentrations of Chinese in the Washington, DC, area are in Montgomery County, Maryland at around 3%, while concentrations in Fairfax and Arlington counties in Virginia are around 2 to 3%, which dwarfs that of Washington's Chinatown at around 3%. As the shift continues, the role that the urban Chinatown once played is now replaced by the \\"satellites\\" in the suburbs. It turns out that the \\"best food is no longer in Chinatown\\" and \\"... the closest Chinese grocery retailer is in Falls Church, Virginia.\\" The Chinese New Year parade is held in the Rockville Town Square. Massachusetts =Boston= Paifang gate to Chinatown, Boston, one of the largest Chinatowns in the United States. The sole established Chinatown of New England is in Boston, on Beach Street and Washington Street near South Station between Downtown Crossing and Tufts Medical Center. There are many Chinese, Japanese, Cambodian, and Vietnamese restaurants and markets in one of the largest Chinatowns in the United States. In the pre-Chinatown era, the area was settled in succession by Irish, Jewish, Italian, and Syrian immigrants as each group replaced another. Syrians were later succeeded by Chinese immigrants, and Chinatown was established in 1890. From the 1960s to the 1980s, Boston's Chinatown was located in the Combat Zone, which served as Boston's red light district, but sandwiched between the dual expansions of Chinatown from the East and Emerson College from the West, the Combat Zone, while still in existence, has shrunk to almost nothing. Currently, Boston's Chinatown is experiencing gentrification. High-rise luxury residential towers are built in and surrounding the area that was overwhelmingly three, four, and five-story small apartment buildings intermixed with retail and light- industrial spaces. Michigan =Detroit= Detroit's Chinatown was originally located at Third Avenue, Porter St and Bagley St, now the permanent site of the MGM Grand Casino.Chinatown, Burton collection, Detroit Public Library In the 1960s, urban renewal efforts, as well as the opportunity for the Chinese business community to purchase property led to a relocation centered at Cass Avenue and Peterboro.Detroit News, Feb 19, 1960 However, Detroit's urban decline and escalating street violence, primarily the killing of restaurateur Tommie Lee, led to the new location's demise, with the last remaining Chinese food restaurant in Chinatown finally shut its doors in the early 2000s. Although there is still a road marker indicating \\"Chinatown\\" and a mural commemorating the struggle for justice in the Vincent Chin case, only one Chinese American establishment still operates within the borders of the City of Detroit. The Association of Chinese Americans Detroit Outreach Center,Association of Chinese Americans Detroit Outreach Center a small community center, serves a handful of new Chinese immigrants who still reside in the Cass Corridor. Missouri =St. Louis= Chinatown in St. Louis, Missouri, was a Chinatown near Downtown St. Louis that existed from 1869 until its demolition for Busch Memorial Stadium in 1966.Ling, 16. Also called Hop Alley, it was bounded by Seventh, Tenth, Walnut and Chestnut streets.Virtual St. Louis: Chinatown Web site The first Chinese immigrant to St. Louis was Alla Lee, born in Ningbo near Shanghai, who arrived in the city in 1857. Lee remained the only Chinese immigrant until 1869, when a group of about 250 immigrants (mostly men) arrived seeking factory work.Ling, 26. In January 1870, another group of Chinese immigrants arrived, including some women.Ling, 27. By 1900, the immigrant population of St. Louis Chinatown had settled at between 300 and 400.Ling, 30. Chinatown established itself as the home to Chinese hand laundries, which in turn represented more than half of the city's laundry facilities.Ling, 36. Other businesses included groceries, restaurants, tea shops, barber shops, and opium dens.Ling, 43. Between 1958 and the mid-1960s, Chinatown was condemned and demolished for urban renewal and to make space for Busch Memorial Stadium. Montana Mai Wah Society Building in Butte, Montana The history of Chinese in Montana closely ties with the building of the Northern Pacific Railroad in the 1860s in many cities and towns including Butte, Big Timber, and other places. An archaeological find uncovered remnants of laundromats and other architectures relating to the Chinese culture. According to another article, of the 20,000 residents of Montana in the 1870s, as many as 1,949 were Chinese. Today, one of the few reminders of Chinese society in Montana is the Chinese New Year parade that is held at the Mai Wah Museum in Butte. =Big Timber= At the end of the 19th century, many Chinese people called Big Timber, Montana home. According to the Billings Gazette, Chinese artifacts dating from the late 1800s to the 1930s were found. The artifacts showed that \\"... Chinese restaurants, laundries and even a house of prostitution did business in the southcentral Montana town.\\" Justin Moschelle, a Master's student at the University of Montana took up an archaeological investigation in the summer of 2008 and uncovered bits and fragments of the once existent Chinatown. Built in the 1880s, \\"... the city block bounded by Anderson, First, Mcleod, and Front streets became the unofficial Chinatown of Big Timber.\\" The article further clarifies that the Chinese history within this Montana town was nearly wiped out with vandals destroying graves and any remaining relics of this community. It wasn't until 2008 that the discovery was made where the town of Big Timber and the U.S. state of Montana nearly lost all traces of any presence of Chinese society. According to the findings, the last Chinese left during the 1930s, \\"... presumably to larger Chinese settlements in California or even back to China. All that remains of the Chinese presence in Big Timber, is a handful of artifacts and stories of Chinese tunnels and the opium trade.\\" =Butte= The Chinatown and the history of the Chinese migrants in Butte is documented in the Mai Wah Museum. Due to the mining boom in Butte, many Chinese workers moved in and set up businesses that led to the creation of a Chinatown. There was anti-Chinese sentiment in the 1870s and onwards due to racism on the part of the white settlers, exacerbated by economic depression, and in 1895, the chamber of commerce and labor unions started a boycott of Chinese owned businesses. The business owners fought back by suing the unions and winning. The decline of Butte's Chinatown that started in 1895 and continued until only 92 Chinese people remained by 1940 in the entire city. After that, the influence the Chinese had on the area was largely gone as they moved out one by one. =Cedar Creek= Cedar Creek, Montana (location referenced in the Battle of Cedar Creek, Montana Territory) was also home to a Chinatown. During an excavation project in 1995 to prove the presence of Chinese in the area, the initial findings did not show much. However, a 2007 finding uncovered \\"...fascinating information about the Cedar Creek Chinese population\\" and the University of Montana and the United States Forest Service have planned to do additional work to trace back to a potentially lost part of Montana's Chinese history. =Helena= Helena, Montana was at one time home to a Chinatown at Reeder's Alley according to the Helena's Ghost Walk tourist attraction. According to another source, Reeder's Alley, as the area was referred to, bordered a \\"... thriving Chinatown\\" which completely vanished by the 1970s. Due to some efforts to preserve the historical aspects of the buildings, the area was spared from complete demolishment, and is fixed up as part of the museum. According to the 1880 US Census, Helena's Chinatown had a Chinese population of 1,765, of which 359 of them were living in the metropolitan area. At that time, this Chinatown was the largest in the state of Montana. Nebraska =Omaha= A sketch entitled \\"Chinese Coolies Crossing the Missouri River,\\" by journalist, artist and later attorney Leavitt Burnham. These scene shows Omaha in the 1880s in the background. The Chinese community in Omaha was originally established in the 1860s by the Union Pacific Railroad and other western industrial concerns as the railroad swept west starting in Omaha. In 1870, Harper's Weekly claimed 250 Chinese laborers passed through Omaha to build a railroad in Texas.\\"Chinese railroad workers crossing the icy Missouri River,\\" Harper's Magazine, 1870. The city's first noted burial of a Chinese person occurred at Prospect Hill Cemetery in July 1874, and an Omaha newspaper noted the local Chinese population was 12 men and one woman. In 1890, there were Omaha has 91 Chinese residents. The Omaha City Directory in 1895 listed at least 21 Chinese-owned laundries. After the Omaha World-Herald reported that 438 men, women, and children were brought to Omaha from China to help with the Chinese village at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition in Omaha, the US Census found 93 Chinese people lived in Omaha in 1900.Meigs, D., Chin, B., and Chen, B. (March 18, 2018) \\"A Timeline of Chinese in Omaha,\\" Omaha Magazine. Retrieved May 13, 2019.

Retrieved May 15, 2019. Nevada =Carson City, Reno, and Virginia City= The city of Carson City, Nevada was once home to a Chinese community of 789 residents. The Chinatown was located near the State Capitol buildings on Third Street between 1855 until 1908 when Chinatown burned to the ground. In 1880, one in five people living in Carson City was Chinese, but by 1950, that number was close to zero. Another source claims that Carson City had the most number of Chinese in 1880 with close to 5,000, other cities in Nevada such as Virginia City, and Reno also had well established Chinatowns. Reno's Chinatown was burned down in 1878 by the Reno Workingmans Party. New Jersey =Newark= Newark's Chinatown was an unincorporated community and neighborhood within the city of Newark in Essex County, New Jersey, United States. It was an ethnic enclave with a large percentage of Chinese immigrants, centered along Market Street from 1875 and remaining on some scale for nearly one hundred years. The center of the neighborhood was directly east of the Government Center neighborhood. The first Chinese businesses appeared in Newark in the second half of the 19th century and in the early part of the 20th century. By the 1920s, the small area had a Chinese population of over 3000. In 1910, a small lane with housing and shopping was built called Mulberry Arcade, connecting Mulberry Street and Columbia Street between Lafayette and Green Streets. In the 1920s, recurring federal opium raids163 CHINESE SEIZED IN 16 OPIUM RAIDS; \\"50 Imported Federal Agents Ply Axes and Pikes in Drive on Newark's Chinatown. GET $50,000 NARCOTIC GEAR Use Fire Trucks and Spotlights to Surprise Quarry in Alleged Centre of Contraband Traffic.\\" disrupted the community, causing many to move to more peaceful places. Despite an attempt to revive the neighborhood decades later, the Mulberry Arcade (the center of Chinatown) was removed in the 1950s. New York =New York City= An intersection in Manhattan Chinatown The New York metropolitan area contains the largest ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia, comprising an estimated 893,697 uniracial individuals as of 2017, including at least 12 Chinatowns - six (or nine, including the emerging Chinatowns in Corona and Whitestone, Queens, and East Harlem, Manhattan) in New York City proper, and one each in Nassau County, Long Island; Edison, New Jersey; and Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, not to mention fledgling ethnic Chinese enclaves emerging throughout the New York City metropolitan area. Chinese Americans, as a whole, have had a (relatively) long tenure in New York City. The first Chinese immigrants came to Lower Manhattan around 1870, looking for the \\"golden\\" opportunities America had to offer. By 1880, the enclave around Five Points was estimated to have from 200 to as many as 1,100 members. However, the Chinese Exclusion Act, which went into effect in 1882, caused an abrupt decline in the number of Chinese who immigrated to New York and the rest of the United States. Later, in 1943, the Chinese were given a small quota, and the community's population gradually increased until 1968, when the quota was lifted and the Chinese American population skyrocketed. In the past few years, the Cantonese dialect that has dominated Chinatown for decades is being rapidly swept aside by Mandarin Chinese, the national language of China and the lingua franca of most of the latest Chinese immigrants. Manhattan Manhattan Chinatown The Manhattan Chinatown (simplified Chinese: Á∫ΩÁ∫¶ÂçéÂü† ; traditional Chinese: Á¥êÁ¥ÑËèØÂü†; pinyin: Ni≈≠yuƒì Hu√° B√π), home to the largest enclave of Chinese people in the Western Hemisphere, is located in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. Within Manhattan's expanding Chinatown lies a Little Fuzhou on East Broadway and surrounding streets, occupied predominantly by immigrants from the Fujian Province of Mainland China. Areas surrounding the \\"Little Fuzhou\\" consist mostly of Cantonese immigrants from Guangdong Province, the earlier Chinese settlers, and in some areas moderately of Cantonese immigrants. In the past few years, however, the Cantonese dialect that has dominated Chinatown for decades is being rapidly swept aside by Mandarin, the national language of China and the lingua franca of most of the latest Chinese immigrants. The energy and population of Manhattan's Chinatown are fueled by relentless, massive immigration from Mainland China, both legal and illegal in origin, propagated in large part by New York's high density, extensive mass transit system, and huge economic marketplace. The early settlers of Manhattan's Chinatown were mostly from Taishan and Hong Kong of the Guangdong Province of China, which are the Cantonese speakers and also from Shanghai. They formed most of the Chinese population of the area surrounded by Mott and Canal Streets. The later settlers, from Fuzhou, Fujian, form the Chinese population of the area bounded by East Broadway. Chinatown's modern borders are roughly Grand Street on the north, Broadway on the west, Chrystie Street on the east, and East Broadway to the south. After 9/11, approximately 23% of these residents have relocated to the surrounding communities of the Mohegan Sun casinos, mainly in Norwich, Connecticut, and creating a new Chinatown there. Queens Elmhurst Chinatown (Âîê‰∫∫Ë°ó, ËâæÂßÜËµ´ÊñØÁâπ) on Broadway, a satellite of Flushing Chinatown. The Flushing Chinatown, in the Flushing area of the borough of Queens in New York City, is one of the largest and fastest growing ethnic Chinese enclaves outside of Asia, as well as within New York City itself. Main Street and the area to its west, particularly along Roosevelt Avenue, have become the primary nexus of Flushing Chinatown. However, Chinatown continues to expand southeastward along Kissena Boulevard and northward beyond Northern Boulevard. In the 1970s, a Chinese community established a foothold in the neighborhood of Flushing, whose demographic constituency had been predominantly non- Hispanic white and Japanese. Taiwanese began the surge of immigration, followed by other groups of Chinese. By 1990, Asians constituted 41% of the population of the core area of Flushing, with Chinese in turn representing 41% of the Asian population. Conversely, the Flushing Chinatown has also become the epicenter of organized prostitution in the United States. However, ethnic Chinese are constituting an increasingly dominant proportion of the Asian population as well as of the overall population in Flushing and its Chinatown. A 1986 estimate by the Flushing Chinese Business Association approximated 60,000 Chinese in Flushing alone. Mandarin Chinese (including Northeastern Mandarin), Fuzhou dialect, Min Nan Fujianese, Wu Chinese, Beijing dialect, Wenzhounese, Shanghainese, Cantonese, Taiwanese, and English are all prevalently spoken in Flushing Chinatown. The popular styles of Chinese cuisine are ubiquitously accessible in Flushing, including Hakka, Taiwanese, Shanghainese, Hunanese, Szechuan, Cantonese, Fujianese, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, and Korean Chinese cuisine. Even the relatively obscure Dongbei style of cuisine indigenous to Northeast China is now available in Flushing, as well as Mongolian cuisine and Uyghur cuisine. Given its rapidly growing status, the Flushing Chinatown may surpass in size and population the original New York City Chinatown in the borough of Manhattan within a few years, and it is debatable whether this has already happened. Elmhurst, another neighborhood in the borough of Queens, also has a large and growing Chinese community. Previously a small area with Chinese shops on Broadway between 81st Street and Cornish Avenue, this newly evolved second Chinatown in Queens has now expanded to 45th Avenue and Whitney Avenue. Newer Chinatowns are emerging in Corona and Whitestone, Queens. Brooklyn Chinatowns in Brooklyn (Â∏ÉÈ≠ØÂÖãÊûóËèØÂü†) By 1988, 90% of the storefronts on Eighth Avenue in the Sunset Park, in southern Brooklyn, had been abandoned. Chinese immigrants then moved into this area, not only new arrivals from China, but also members of Manhattan's Chinatown, seeking refuge from high rents, who fled to the cheap property costs and rents of Sunset Park and formed what the website of the local branch of the Chinese Benevolent Association has called \\"the Brooklyn Chinatown\\", which now extends for 20 blocks along 8th Avenue, from 42nd to 62nd Streets. This relatively new but rapidly growing Chinatown located in Sunset Park, Brooklyn was originally settled by Cantonese immigrants like Manhattan's Chinatown in the past. However, in the recent decade, an influx of Fuzhou immigrants has been pouring into Brooklyn's Chinatown and supplanting the Cantonese at a significantly higher rate than in Manhattan's Chinatown, and Brooklyn Chinatown is now home to mostly Fuzhou immigrants. In the past, during the 1980s and 1990s, the majority of newly arriving Fuzhou immigrants were settling within Manhattan's Chinatown, and the first Little Fuzhou community emerged in New York City within Manhattan's Chinatown; by the 2000s, however, the epicenter of the massive Fuzhou influx had shifted to Brooklyn Chinatown, which is now home to the fastest growing and perhaps largest Fuzhou population in New York City. Unlike the Little Fuzhou in the Manhattan Chinatown, which remains surrounded by areas which continue to house significant populations of Cantonese, all of Brooklyn's Chinatown is swiftly consolidating into New York City's new Little Fuzhou. However, a growing community of Wenzhounese immigrants from China's Zhejiang Province is now also arriving in Brooklyn Chinatown. Also in contrast to Manhattan's Chinatown, which still successfully continues to carry a large Cantonese population and retain the large Cantonese community established decades ago in the western section of Manhattan's Chinatown, where Cantonese residents have a communal gathering venue to shop, work, and socialize, Brooklyn Chinatown is very quickly losing its Cantonese community identity. Within Brooklyn, newer satellite Chinatowns are emerging around Avenue U and Bensonhurst, as well as in Bay Ridge, Borough Park, Coney Island, Dyker Heights, Gravesend, and Marine Park. While the foreign-born Chinese population in New York City jumped 35 percent between 2000 and 2013, to 353,000 from about 262,000, the foreign-born Chinese population in Brooklyn increased 49 percent during the same period, to 128,000 from 86,000, according to The New York Times. Ohio =Cleveland= Cleveland, Ohio's Chinatown is an ethnic neighborhood established in the late nineteenth century. A majority of Chinese Ohioans lived in northeastern Ohio, where they worked in factories or established their own businesses to provide their fellow Chinese Americans with traditional Chinese products. For most of the second half of the nineteenth century, Cleveland, which had the largest Chinese-American population in Ohio, had fewer than one hundred Chinese residents. By World War II, the city's Chinese population had increased to almost nine hundred. With the communist takeover of China in the late 1940s, an increase in Chinese immigration occurred to the United States, including to Ohio. Most of these new migrants came from Hong Kong or Taiwan. At the start of the twenty-first century, a small number of Chinese people continued to come to Ohio each year. By 1980, six thousand Cleveland residents claimed Chinese ancestry. The first Chinese people to come to Cleveland arrived in the mid nineteenth century. They settled along Ontario Street, where they established Chinatown. For most of its history, Cleveland's Chinatown consisted of only one city block and contained several Chinese restaurants, laundries, and specialty stores. Initially, most Chinese in Cleveland lived in Chinatown to surround themselves with people of similar cultural beliefs and also to escape the animosity of Cleveland's other residents. Over time, especially by the 1960s, many Chinese Clevelanders began to move into new neighborhoods, as Cleveland's other residents became more tolerant of the Chinese. Oklahoma =Oklahoma City= Oklahoma City once had a historic Chinatown in its downtown area, located at the current location of the Cox Convention Center. Oregon =Portland= Old Town Chinatown is the official Chinatown of the Northwest section of Portland, Oregon. The Willamette River forms its eastern boundary, separating it from the Lloyd District and the Kerns and Buckman neighborhoods. It includes the Portland Skidmore/Old Town Historic District and the Portland New Chinatown/Japantown Historic District, which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In the Northwest section, NW Broadway forms the western boundary, separating the neighborhood from the Pearl District, and W Burnside St. forms the southern boundary, separating it from Downtown Portland. In the Southwest section, the neighborhood extends from SW 3rd Avenue east to the Willamette River and from SW Stark Sreet north to W Burnside Street, with the exception of areas south of SW Pine Street and west of SW 2nd Avenue, and south of SW Oak Street and west of SW 1st Avenue, which are parts of Downtown. =Salem= Downtown Salem had a Chinatown during the mid-to-late-1800s, which vanished in the 1920s. Ships from Hong Kong started arriving in Portland in 1868, and some Chinese immigrants settled in Salem in the next two decades. Salem's Chinatown spanned Commercial, Ferry and Trade streets, and had markets, laundromats, and medicine shops. The local Chinese population reached a peak of 367 in 1890, although it decreased to 72 residents in 1920. Pennsylvania Paifang gate in Chinatown, Philadelphia Built in 1922, Pittsburgh =Philadelphia= There is a Chinatown centered on 10th and Race Streets in Philadelphia. Over the years, several blocks were lost to the Pennsylvania Convention Center, and the Vine Street Expressway. For the past few years, city officials have restricted redevelopment in Chinatown, particularly as a result of efforts by a coalition of grassroots groups (pan-ethnic, labor groups) working together to preserve Chinatown. Today the lost blocks have been regained by the expansion of Chinatown to Arch Street and north of Vine Street. Asian restaurants, funeral homes, and grocery stores are common sights. Philadelphia's Chinatown residents are mostly of Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, and Cambodian descent. Korean, Japanese, and Filipinos are also residents. Chinatown contains a mixture of businesses and organizations owned by the pan-Chinese diaspora, as Mainland Chinese, Vietnamese Chinese, Hong Kong Chinese, and Malaysian Chinese residing in the Philadelphia area call Chinatown home. =Pittsburgh= Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was home to a \\"small, but busy\\" Chinatown, located at the intersection of Grant Street and Boulevard of the Allies where only two Chinese restaurants remain. The On Leong Society was located there. According to the article, \\"... the first Chinese community in Pittsburgh developed around Wylie Avenue above Court Place,\\" according to a 1942 newsletter of the American Service Institute of Allegheny County. The Chinatown spread to Grant Street, and then \\"... to Water Street and then spread out to Second and Third avenues.\\" By the 1950s, the Chinese community had exited the neighborhood, leaving this Chinatown extinct today. Rhode Island =Providence= Providence, Rhode Island was once home to at least two Chinatowns, with the first on Burrill Street in the 1890s until 1901 and then around Empire Street around the late 1890s in the southern section of the city. According to another source, the Burrill Street Chinatown was burned to the ground in 1901 by a \\"mysterious fire\\" caused by a kerosene stove. The Empire Street Chinatown was considered one of the \\"last of the old Chinatowns\\" in a grouping that included Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore. The extension of Empire Street, proposed in 1914 (according to the Providence Sunday Journal) and completed around 1951 doomed the Chinatown, and all of the buildings were demolished including the former headquarters of local Chinese societies. The enclave was once located next to the Empire Theatre and the Central Baptist Church. South Dakota =Deadwood= A Chinatown once existed in Deadwood, South Dakota around the mid 1880s. The Chinese community consisted mainly of gold mine workers who were often classified as \\"rugged\\". Texas =Houston= The U.S. city of Houston has two locations that have been recognized as Chinatown. The older neighborhood is in East Downtown Houston and the newer community is located in Southwest Houston. The first businesses of the East Downtown Chinatown were opened by Cantonese Chinese immigrants in the 1930s. It continued to grow in subsequent decades until many of its businesses relocated to Houston's new Chinatown. There have been attempts by business leaders to reverse the decline of Chinatown in East Downtown, but many new residents have sought to rebrand the area to reflect the current cultural shift. The new Houston Chinatown in Southwest Houston can trace its beginnings to several businesses that opened in 1983. The new Chinatown began to expand in the 1990s when many Houston-area Asian American entrepreneurs moved their businesses from older neighborhoods in a search for more inexpensive properties and lower crime rates (at the time). Houston's new Chinatown is about 12 miles (19 km) southwest of Downtown Houston. It is over 6 square miles (16 km2), making it among the largest automobile-centric Chinatowns in the United States.Gray, Lisa. \\"Branding Chinatown: Neighborhood transforms.\\" Houston Chronicle. January 8, 2008. Retrieved on August 11, 2011. Some local officials have tried to change the name of the new Chinatown to \\"Asia Town\\" due to many different ethnic groups having a presence there. =Richardson and Plano= The D-FW China Town shopping center is located in Richardson because of the large Asian population.Light, Nanette. \\"Three decades later, Dallas Chinese Community Center still heart of Asian culture\\" (Archive). The Dallas Morning News. February 21, 2014. Retrieved on September 22, 2014. Esther Wu, a former editor of the Dallas Morning News, stated that Chinese immigration began in Richardson in 1975. Since then the Chinese community has expanded to the north.Brenner, Leslie. \\"Best in DFW: Chinese restaurants\\" (Archive). The Dallas Morning News. March 9, 2011. Updated February 10, 2013. Retrieved on September 22, 2014. In the mid-1980s the majority of ethnic Chinese K-12 students in the DFW area resided in Richardson.Kripke, Pamela Gwyn. \\"Why 30,000 Chinese People Call Plano Home\\" (Archive). D Magazine. June 2012. Retrieved on September 27, 2014. As of 2012 North Texas has over 60 Chinese cultural organizations and most of them are headquartered in Richardson and Plano. The Dallas Chinese Community Center (DCCC; ) is in the D-FW Chinatown. It includes English as a second language (ESL) classes and 20,000 books written in Traditional Chinese; the center imported some books from Taiwan. As of 2011 the Chinese restaurants catering to ethnic Chinese in DFW are mainly in Richardson and Plano. The University of Texas at Dallas in Richardson, as of 2012, has almost 1,000 Chinese students. The university has a program to recruit students of Chinese origin. Utah =Salt Lake City= Historically, Salt Lake City, Utah had a Chinatown that was located in a section called \\"Plum Alley\\" that contained a Chinese population that worked in the mining camps and the transcontinental railroad. The first Chinese peoples came in the 1860s and had formed a historical Chinatown in a section called \\"Plum Alley\\" on Second South Street which lasted until 1952. The area had a network of laundromats, restaurants and oriental specialty shops. Washington =Seattle= Seattle's current Chinese neighborhood came into being around 1910 when much of the former Chinatown along Washington Street was condemned for street construction. The Chinese population began rebuilding along King Street, south of Seattle's Nihonmachi. Chinese investors pooled their resources to build several substantial buildings to house businesses, organizations and residences, such as the East Kong Yick Building. In the 1950s Seattle officials designated Chinatown as part of the International District (I.D.) due to the diverse Asian population that, by then, included Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, and Koreans. By the late 1970s, Vietnamese immigrants also formed a Little Saigon next to Chinatown, within the ID. There has been some controversy over the name \\"International District.\\" Some local Chinese Americans reject the term, preferring the historic designation \\"Chinatown\\" for the area as a source of pride. Others, especially American born generations of Asians, accept the ID designation as more appropriate due to their embrace of a more \\"pan-Asian\\" identity. Subsequently, the city redesignated the area the Chinatown-International District. =Spokane= A fair sized Chinatown existed in Spokane for years that started when the railroad came through in 1883. It consisted of a network of alleys between Front Avenue (today's Spokane Falls Boulevard) and Main Avenue that stretched east from Howard Avenue to Bernard Street about four blocks. The Chinese population gradually thinned out until the alley became abandoned by the 1940s. All the remains of Chinatown were demolished for parking for Spokane's Expo '74. In the 1880s, Spokane had a \\"bustling Chinatown\\" which was as big as three to four blocks \\"... stretching from Howard Street to Bernard Street ...\\" along Spokane Falls Blvd. It earned the nickname \\"Japanese Alley\\" or \\"Trent Alley\\". More sources said that the Chinatown swelled even more during the Franklin Delano Roosevelt era with the internment of Asian peoples due to the war against Japan. An old newspaper article shows that an annual convention for the Chinese Hip Sing organization was held in 1924. =Tacoma= Tacoma, Washington was once home to a significant historic Chinatown in Downtown Tacoma near Railroad Street. In November 1885 disgruntled whites drove out the Chinese population and burned down Chinatown. According to a historical account, many who were driven out fled to Portland, Oregon or Canada. Two days after the Chinese were driven out, Tacoma's Chinatown was burned to the ground. According to another source, as many as six hundred Chinese were dragged out to the street in a raid and escorted to the train station. The Chinese Reconciliation Park was designed to be an historical monument and to commemorate the historic tragedy of the 1885 Chinese expulsion as part of a reconciliation process.Tacoma plans a Chinese-style garden to help bind century-old wounds =Walla Walla= Walla Walla, Washington was once home to a small Chinatown. Wyoming Rock Springs Massacre The state of Wyoming had three Chinatowns between 1880 and 1927. In 1927, all three Chinatowns had vanished due to the Chinese Exclusion Act. =Almy, Evanston, and Rock Springs= The Almy, Wyoming was the smallest of the three Chinatowns in Wyoming. This community was located seven miles north of Evanston's Chinatown. The Evanston, Wyoming was the most diverse of the three Chinatowns in Wyoming. The Rock Springs, Wyoming was the largest of the three Chinatowns in Wyoming. This community was also located seven miles north of Evanston's Chinatown. It was the site of the infamous Rock Springs Massacre, in which many Chinese died.

History =Founding= The Library was founded on February 23, 1921, by the Algonquin Women's Club, who sought and gained approval from the Village of Algonquin to install shelves in the council room of the Algonquin Village Hall for a public library. Three years later, on April 15, 1924, Algonquin residents voted to support the library with tax dollars. The Algonquin Public Library functioned as a village supported library until 1962, when voters approved a referendum for the library to reorganize as the Algonquin Area Public Library District.History of the Algonquin Area Public Library, Algonquin, Ill.,1973. =Expansion= The Algonquin Area Public Library continued to house its collection within the Algonquin Village Hall until a new library building was built on Eastgate Drive. The land for the library building was purchased in April 1974 for $37,000.History of the Algonquin Area Public Library, Algonquin, Ill.,1973. The next year, voters approved the sale of bonds to build a new 16,000 sq. ft. library for $595,000. Thirteen months after breaking ground, the Board of Trustees held an open house at the new library on Eastgate drive on March 27, 1977. In November 1998, a $7.8 million bond issue was passed for the construction of another library facility on the west side of town to meet the demands of a growing population. The new library building on Harnish Drive, also known as the Main Library, opened to the public on October 15, 2001.

By August 2000, a total of eight Rocket eBook Readers were in circulation. As the e-book market matured and consumer devices became more affordable, the Library shifted its model of e-book service from circulating devices to providing downloadable e-book content. The Rocket eBook Readers were eventually retired. One of the Readers was donated to the Algonquin Historic Commission, while the others were sold by the Friends of the Algonquin Area Public Library District in their Spring Book Sale. =Radio- frequency Identification= The Algonquin Area Public Library District was also an early adopter of Radio-frequency identification (RFID).http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/stories/2003/06/23/daily3.html When the Harnish Drive facility opened in October 2001, the Library installed the Checkpoint Intelligent Library System (ILS), an RFID-based materials handling and security system.

It was discovered that the San Francisco & San Joaquin Coal Company's Tesla coal mines in Corral Hollow contained a rich deposit of clay. Fueled by California's rapid population growth and the subsequent demand for building materials mine owners James and John Treadwell of the Treadwell gold mine formed the Carnegie Brick and Pottery Company in 1902. The Treadwells named the company after philanthropist Andrew Carnegie. In 1904 the plant to make brick and architectural terra cotta was built near the Alameda and San Joaquin Railroad line, four miles east of the coal mining town of Tesla. A town was in place with over 300 inhabitants (mainly Italian artisans) and the town's brick factory was producing upwards of 100,000 bricks per day. In 1904, the Pottery sewer pipe plant was built between Carnegie and Tesla. In 1911 a flood destroyed bridges, roads, and buildings which the company could not afford to rebuild. The towns of Carnegie and Tesla were abandoned. The rail line from Carbona was abandoned by the Western Pacific Railroad in January 1916. Dan L. Mosier, Brief History of the Tesla Area In 1916 the company was sold to Gladding, McBean of Lincoln, California. The new owners, in an effort to reduce competition, sold off the factory's equipment and destroyed what remained of the town's buildings. On May 27, 1917 the tall smokestacks at the plant were dynamited. Today only the foundation of the brick works can be seen within the Carnegie State Vehicular Recreation Area. Materials from Carnegie Brick and Pottery were used to build the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, the Oakland Hotel, and the Carnegie libraries in Livermore and Lodi, California. The site of the former town is registered as a California Historical Landmark.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Wigan, the archdeaconry of Wigan & West Lancashire, and the diocese of Liverpool. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History St Matthew's was built between 1892 and 1894, and designed by the Lancaster firm of architects, Paley, Austin and Paley. It was paid for by Colonel Henry Blundell- Hollinshead-Blundell, owner of the Pemberton Colliery, in memory of his wife, Beatrice who had died in 1884. The church cost over ¬£10,000 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). The nave and the south aisle were extended to the west in 1909‚Äì10 by Austin and Paley. In 1917 a stone reredos, designed by Harry Paley, was installed as a memorial to Colonel Blundell. Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in Runcorn red sandstone, with a red tiled roof. Its architectural style is Early English. The plan consists of a five-bay nave, a two-bay north aisle, a north porch, a five-bay south aisle, north and south transepts, and a single-bay chancel. Above the crossing is tower with a spire. Around the church are pilasters, and all the windows are lancets. The tower has two unequal stages and a northeast stair turret. Between the stages is a string course, and the upper stage contains two louvred bell openings on each side. The parapet is stepped at the corners, and the tower is surmounted by an octagonal spire with lucarnes. =Interior= Inside the church are a two-bay north arcade and a five-bay south arcade. The north transept contains a Lady chapel, and in the south transept is the organ loft. On the south side of the chancel is a sedilia. The furnishings were designed by the architects, including the reredos of 1917, the font, and the pulpit. The stained glass in the east window (from 1917), and in the north aisle and transept (from the 1920s) is by Hardmans. Also in the church are three windows designed by Harold Harvey, dating between 1976 and 1992.

He focused his research and his product development projects on critical facilities that are needed to remain functional during and in the aftermath of a major tremor such as fire command centers, hospitals, and transportation facilities. Chalhoub applied advanced structural dynamics to projects such as TITAN IV Solid Motor, Disney theme parks, and offshore docking cells. Chalhoub became well known for his work on fluid-structure interaction as researchers, to-date, use his work as a historic reference on structures and fluids in some of the most seismically active countries such as Japan, Turkey, and Iran.International Journal of Civil Engineering 2009.\\"Numerical Accuracy of Mass-Spring Models of Cylindrical Tanks under Seismic Excitation\\". He was awarded the Graduate Student Instructor Award at the University of California in 1988, and the Engineer of the Year Award at the Parsons Corporation in Pasadena in 1990 for pioneering work in applied dynamics to solve environmental problems. His works in 1991 on wave motion and the effect of currents on ocean floor structures was adopted for the design of the Point Loma Outfall extension project in 1992 and 1993, a facility which became known as one of the longest and deepest in the world.City of San Diego, Point Loma Outfall A few years earlier, he had completed the design of docking cells subjected to wave and ice loading in Prudhoe Bay Alaska. His projects include The Typhoon Lagoon in Disney World, Florida. He performed the study of this theme park featuring a wave generator made of a twelve-cell prestressed concrete structure discharging in an artificial lagoon. The water is released through steel gates, one at the bottom of each funnel-shaped cell, forming gravity waves that propagate across the lagoon and break on its shore. A few years later, the idea was applied in Japan. While at Parsons, Chalhoub chaired the committee on base isolation at the Structural Engineers Association of California (SEAOC) and developed the simplified design code on seismic design using shock absorbers which was introduced for the first time in the Uniform Building Code in 1990. Simplified code formulas help engineers worldwide adopt and apply engineering concepts in their daily practice, providing effective design, yet without having to burden themselves with complex research derivations.Journal of Structural Engineering. \\"Comparison of SEAONC Base Isolation Tentative Code to Shake Table Tests - JSE 1990\\".

The applicant was a woman married in terms of Muslim rites, whose husband had died intestate. The court noted that Muslim marriages were not recognised in South African law. It concluded that this violated section 9 of the Constitution. Accordingly, it was held that the applicant could inherit. The ambit of this judgment was restricted to de facto monogamous Muslim marriages; it was extended to polygamous Muslim marriages in Hassam v Jacobs. In this Context the word \\"spouses\\" was questioned  Facts  An application was made for confirmation of an order of the Cape High Court which declared invalid and unconstitutional certain provisions of the Maintenance ActAct 27 of 1990. and the Intestate Succession ActAct 81 of 1987. for their failure to recognise as \\"spouses\\" persons married according to Muslim rites, and therefore to allow partners in Muslim marriages to benefit from their protections, which include the provision of relief to widows to ensure that they receive at least a child's share of their husbands' estates. The Muslim wife in this case was going to lose a house she owned which was registered in her deceased husband‚Äôs name. In terms of the Maintenance of Surviving Spouses Act, certain benefits are conferred on ‚Äúspouses,‚Äù a term which did not include spouses in a de facto monogamous Muslim marriage. It is important to note that the question before the court was not whether Muslim marriage is lawful under the Marriage Act.Act 25 of 1961. Muslim marriages have not yet been expressly recognised in South African law, although there is a Draft Muslim Marriages Bill.  Judgment  Sachs J held that the word \\"spouse,\\" in its ordinary meaning, should include parties to a Muslim marriage, because this corresponds to the way the word is generally understood and used, and because it would be far more awkward from a linguistic point of view to exclude Muslim partners than to include them. The historic exclusion in South Africa flowed not from the courts' giving the word its ordinary meaning but from a linguistically- strained usage and from cultural and racial prejudices. Both the intent and the impact of the restrictive interpretation were discriminatory.Para 19. The words \\"spouse\\" and \\"survivor\\" as used in the Acts would henceforth apply to partners to monogamous Muslim marriages. The court intentionally did not deal with the question of polygamous Muslim marriages.

Yale University, 1996), pp. 2-6, 33-38. The manuscript contains three Latin-Old English glossaries. The First Cleopatra Glossary (folios 5r-75v) is alphabeticised by first letter, drawing on a wide range of sources, including a glossary more or less identical to the Third Cleopatra Glossary, material related to the Corpus Glossary, and a glossed text of Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae.Phillip Pulsiano, ‚ÄòPrayers, Glosses and Glossaries‚Äô, in A Companion to Anglo-Saxon Literature, ed. by Phillip Pulsiano and Elaine Treharne (Oxford, 2001), p. 218; Patrizia Lendinara, ‚ÄòAnglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries: An Introduction‚Äô, in Anglo-Saxon Glosses and Glossaries (Aldershot, 1999), pp. 1‚Äì26 (pp. 22-26); Wolfgang Kittlick, 'Die Glossen der Hs.

Some of these sources are among the earliest glosses in English, but the Cleopatra reviser (or his source) often revised them. The glossary only gets as far as P: the compilation or copying seems never to have been completed. The Second Cleopatra Glossary (folios 76r-91v) contains a shorter glossary, organised by subject. A closely related glossary is found in the first three subject lists of the Brussels Glossary (Brussels, Royal Library, 1928-30). The Third Cleopatra Glossary (folios 92r-117v) contains glosses to Aldhelm's Prosa de virginitate and Carmen de virginitate, with the lemmata in the same order as they appear in the text. It was presumably, therefore, based on a copy of Aldhelm's texts which had interlinear glosses.See for more detail Mechthild Gretsch, The Intellectual Foundations of the English Benedictine Reform, Cambridge Studies in Anglo-Saxon England, 25 (Cambridge, 1999), pp. 139-41.

Kittlick's linguistic investigation showed that some, at least, of the glosses in the Third Cleopatra Glossary are in the Anglian dialect of Old English, with later overlays from West Saxon and Kentish (probably in that order). The glossary-- though not necessarily all its entries--must have originated in the eighth century.Wolfgang Kittlick, 'Die Glossen der Hs. British Library, Cotton Cleopatra A.

The aircraft, which was carrying 29 students home to England, had been chartered by the National Union of Students to conduct regular weekly flights between Gatwick and Barcelona. It was the first accident suffered by a Transair aircraft following the airline's formation in 1947. Accident The aircraft, registered G-AMZD, had arrived early on the day of the accident at Barcelona from Gatwick with a party of students on board, and was scheduled to return to London with another group of students who were returning home from a holiday in Majorca. The flight was conducted under visual flight rules (VFR); however, 19 minutes after departure from Barcelona, while climbing to its cruising altitude, the Dakota entered cloud and struck Tur√≥ de l'Home, a mountain north east of Barcelona. At the time of the accident the aircraft was away from its intended flight path. Locals reported that at the time of the crash it was misty in the area. An official at a nearby weather station raised the alarm upon observing the crash. Upon arrival, the Spanish Civil Guard found the wreckage of the aircraft had been burnt out by a post-impact fire. All 29 passengers and three crew were killed. Probable cause Following an investigation of the accident, a report from the Spanish Director-General of Civil Aviation stated: The Director-General also stated that the evidence did not indicate that Spanish Air Traffic Control personnel were responsible for the crash through their actions in any way. In addition, there was no evidence found that any defects in aids to navigation contributed to the accident. Accordingly, the British Air Ministry, also investigating the crash, resolved to close the case without allocating responsibility. It was concluded that the pilot should not have entered cloud without advising air traffic control that he required an instrument flight clearance; it was presumed that the pilot was unaware that Tur√≥ de l'Home, in height, was in the path of the aircraft at the time the Dakota entered the clouds.

The company's products include energy, weight management, nutrition, personal care, home care and fashion accessories on an e-commerce platform. It operates legally in some countries, but has been charged with Ponzi scheme and multi level marketing in countries such as India. The government of India and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India banned the site in India after a protest spread in Bangalore. Qnet's operations tend to be franchised out to local companies, thus allowing the head office to earn while relieving it of liability and responsibility from local and national cases of fraud.  History  Global Support Centre of Qi group (The Qi Tower) in Petaling JayaQnet was founded in 1998 in Hong Kong by Malaysian businessman Vijay Eswaran. Though born and brought up in Malaysia, Eswaran undertook his higher education in the United Kingdom where he learned how multi level marketing schemes work. He subsequently worked in the Philippines in a multi level marketing company. The company was first known as GoldQuest and then QuestNet. It made custom-commissioned commemorative coins and later began selling jewellery and watches. In 1999, Qnet expanded its operations to Malaysia and Singapore and began a partnership with B.H. Mayer's Mint, a German-based mint coin facility. In 2000, Qnet was the official distributor of the Sydney Olympic Games commemorative coins and was also a distributor at the 2004 Athens Olympic Games and 2008 Beijing Olympic Games. The company expanded its operations to Dubai, India, Indonesia and Thailand in 2001. Qnet started to diversify its products in 2002 into travel and vacations by partnering with QVI Club brand holidays. During this time, the company also announced that it was the official coin distributor for the 2002 FIFA World Cup and an expansion into Europe, Australia and Sri Lanka. In 2005, Qnet acquired QI Comm, a British telecommunications company. The company announced that it had more than 1 million independent distributors during the introduction of aspIRe Magazine. In 2006, Qnet began marketing energy, health and nutritional products. That same year, Qnet acquired Prana Resorts and Spa, a vegetarian holiday resort in Koh Samui. Qnet also acquired the Swiss watchmaker, Cimier. In 2007, the QI Group acquired Down To Earth (DTE), a vegetarian organic health store chain in Hawaii. The company announced its sponsorship of Team Meritus, a Malaysian motor racing team, and became a sponsor for the Commonwealth Heads Of Government Meeting Business Forum in 2007. From 2007 and 2012, Qnet's direct sales increased by 70%. From 2009 to 2012, Qnet was an official sponsor of the Asian Football Confederation during the AFC Champions League. In 2010, the company partnered with Virgin Racing. Qnet received the TRUSTe Privacy Certification in late 2012. In 2013, Qnet announced its intention to shift its manufacturing operations to India and to open an office in Russia. The company's QI Tower in Malaysia received the 2013 Building and Construction Authority (BCA) Green Mark Gold Award. In 2014, Qnet started a three-year partnership with Manchester City football club to become the club's official direct selling partner. Qnet changed its name repeatedly and launched at least 76 companies (as per the Bombay High court order of May 2016), often to sell lesser known products manufactured by smaller companies using a multi- level marketing/direct sales model. Common people (IR in Qnet parlance) were taught to sell these products (often through workshops). Sellers earned commissions for each new seller / buyer brought into the fold. Since it opened in 1998, Qnet (Questnet at the time) promoted gold and silver coins. The coin collection business was outlawed in some countries. Though registered in Hong Kong, the company has never operated there or in China. Its majority customer base remains in India and a few African countries. A few years later Questnet changed its name to Qnet and offered additional products via the MLM system. It promotes its products using claims \\"that would not pass official muster in much of the world.\\" Despite claiming to be an e-commerce based business, an ordinary retail customer can purchase a product only if they have a referrer ID of an independent Qnet representative. Qnet used websites such as www.Qnetindia.in, www.Qnetindia.net, www.Qnet.net and www.questnet.net to conduct its business. These were blocked by Indian Computer emergency response team (CERT) following a court order. Other websites like portal.Qnetindia.net, are under investigation. Despite complaints, the company continues to operate in countries including India, and sells its products using a multi-level marketing model, whereby independent representatives refer the products to consumers and receive compensation based on the sales volume of their referrals and the sales volume of other independent representatives in their teams. The company has operations in more than 30 countries with offices in Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Philippines, United Arab Emirates, Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Rwanda with franchise companies in India. Singapore and Turkey. It was sued by Egypt, Rwanda, and Sri Lanka for allegedly operating a product-based pyramid scheme. The company and its franchise Vihaan are under investigation in India. The Bombay High Court denied the anticipatory bail plea of the directors of Vihaan Direct Selling Pvt Ltd., a franchise of Qnet, which included world amateur billiards champion Michael Ferreira after it was earlier rejected by Sessions Court. They were facing charges of cheating and forgery The court observed that \\"the deceit and fraud is camouflaged under the name of e-marketing and business\\". The Delhi High Court also called it a multi-victim scam and refused to quash FIR against the directors of Indian franchise of Qnet, Vihaan Direct Selling Private Limited. The Serious Fraud Investigation Office, in its report on GoldQuest and QuestNet India has called multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes run by overseas operators as \\"a potential threat to national security\\". The Government of India ordered the Serious Fraud Investigation Office to file prosecution against GoldQuest International and QuestNet Enterprise under the Companies Act and Indian Penal Code. A brief executive summary of the SFIO report is now available in the public domain. The company has denied the allegations.  Business model  MLM binary tree structure. The blue individual will receive compensation from the sales of the downline red members. The company employs a multi-level marketing model whereby a group of independent representatives refer its products to consumers and receive compensation based on the sales volume of their referrals and the sales volume of other independent representatives on their teams. Customers can choose to become \\"independent representatives\\" (IRs) of the company by paying $10 for a starter kit and an online office. IRs receive $250 commission after they introduce the products to six people, placing three people on their left and three people on their right, described as two 'legs'. When an IR introduces a new customer who then becomes an IR themselves, the original IR benefits (by receiving bonus points) from the success of their recruit. These bonus points build up on only one of the IR's legs. The IR must then find recruits for the other leg in order to receive commissions. Many government entities described Qnet's business model as a pyramid scheme: early entrants earn money, and as the number of Independent Representatives (IRs) increases, finding more IRs to join becomes difficult or impossible; IRs that join late do not earn enough to cover their first outlay and the model collapses. As per an official spokesperson, even though sign-up fees are not charged, a purchase might be required. This may be in the form of the sale of a qualifying product to a retail customer or by the new representative making a qualifying purchase.  Products  The company markets many unbranded products including air purifiers, cosmetics, soaps and detergents and commemorative coins. Initially the company sold gold commemorative coins. Qnet expanded its products to include travel in 2002. By 2006, Qnet had transitioned to marketing and selling \\"aspirational products\\", which claim to boost energy, health and nutrition. According to Eswaran, these types of products account for 30% of Qnet's sales. The company introduced \\"life-enhancing products\\" such as a portable water filtration system and an air purifier, which Qnet claims can fix pollution issues in homes. Some of its products fall under a \\"wellness\\" brand, such as the Amezcua Bio Disc (also spelled BioDisc and BioDisk). According to Quest Net's advertisement, the disc creates a 'water-impacting' energy field that 'helps to reduce stress, improve sleep'. The company claims that it was invented by Dr Ian Lyons, but his antecedents and research publication are not known. Schott AG is the only industrial glass manufacturer that certifies production of Biodisc, but does not reflect Qnet's advertising that it is 'creating an impact energy field'. The Amezcua Bio Disc has been evaluated by research facilities in Germany, India and Japan. The product has received scrutiny from various scientists, media commentators and watchdogs.  Controversies  Qnet has faced controversies since soon after its founding. It has faced litigation in many countries and hundreds of IRs working for it and/or its many subsidiaries have been arrested. = Gold coins = GoldQuest marketed a gold coin at a 100% premium over similar coins.

The applicant was a party to a polygamous Muslim marriage, whose husband had died intestate. The Constitutional Court held that precluding the applicant from inheriting unfairly discriminated on the grounds of religion, marital status and gender, and was therefore inconsistent with section 9 of the Constitution. Accordingly, it was held that the applicant could inherit. The ambit of this judgment extended the ruling in Daniels v Campbell to polygamous Muslim marriages.  Facts  The question was whether or not the benefits provided by the Intestate Succession ActAct 81 of 1987.) and the Maintenance ActAct 27 of 1990. accrue to surviving spouses of polygynous Muslim marriages. The objective of the legislation is to ensure that widows receive at least a child's share of their spouse's estates instead of being left precariously dependent on family benevolence. The Cape High Court found the Intestate Succession Act,s 1(4)(f). in discriminating on grounds of gender and religion and marital status, to be inconsistent with the Constitution. The word \\"spouse\\" in the Act should be interpreted henceforth to include partners in polygynous Muslim marriages, while \\"survivor\\" in the Maintenance Act should be read to include surviving partners of polygynous Muslim marriages.  Judgment  In the Constitutional Court, however, \\"spouse\\" was found not to be reasonably capable of being understood to include more than one partner in the context of a polygynous Muslim marriage. The words \\"or spouses,\\" therefore, are henceforth to be readj in after each use of the word \\"spouse\\" in the Act.

Hills  The highest point in the karst landscape ‚àí which is dotted with sinkholes ‚àí is the Buchholzer Berg (350.1 m), west of Buchholz. ‚Üí Other hills in the range may be found in the Harz section of the article on \\"List of mountains and hills of Thuringia\\"  History  A Landwehr regiment was stationed in R√ºdigsdorf Switzerland during the First World War. During the 20th century around a third of the natural landscape was destroyed by gypsum quarrying. In early 2005, quarrying was due to restart, but was prevented by protest from the local population. Nevertheless, there is still interest in the area from the gypsum industry.  Hiking  R√ºdigsdorf Switzerland is crossed by the Karst Trail, a thematic long-distance path which links places of natural interest in the landscape. At the top of the village of R√ºdigsdorf used to be checkpoint no. 100 in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network. It has since been moved elsewhere.

He held the offices of Constable of Dublin Castle and Master of the Rolls in Ireland; to obtain the latter office was a notable achievement for a man who began his career as a cloth-maker and had no legal qualifications which would fit him for judicial office. He also sat in the Irish House of Commons in the Parliament of 1560. As a politician he was noted for leading the opposition to the Earl of Sussex, the Lord Deputy of Ireland.  Background and business career  He was a native of Tenterden in Kent, where he was in business as a cloth-maker in the 1530s.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221‚Äì1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.1 p.205 Later in the same decade he joined the household of Arthur Plantagenet, 1st Viscount Lisle, the Governor of Calais. Throughout his career, even while acting as a public servant, he pursued his own business interests, first as a ship-owner and then as a maker of hats and tapestries. For the latter trade he obtained a royal licence to import dyed wool.Ball pp. 140‚Äì141 He seems to have been a sincere religious reformer, although like many reformers he personally did very well out of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. He received Selskar Abbey in Wexford, Rosbercon Abbey in Kilkenny (although he apparently never lived there, and let it decay into a ruin), Holmpatrick Abbey near Skerries, Dublin and Tircroghan in Westmeath.Ball pp.205‚Äì206 In his last years he was attempting to purchase Kilcormac Abbey in County Offaly. Despite his apparent wealth Parker, like so many notable figures of the Tudor era, died in debt. Selskar Abbey, which Parker acquired after the Dissolution of the Monasteries  Political and judicial career  He is first recorded in Ireland about 1540 as secretary to the Lord Deputy, Sir Anthony St. Leger.Ball p.205 He became Constable of Dublin Castle in 1543 and organised the defence of Carrickfergus in 1551. He entered the Irish House of Commons as MP for Trim in 1560, and was a Royal Commissioner in Munster in 1562. Although he held a number of quasi- judicial posts, such as Marshal of the Dublin Courts, these seem to have been sinecures. His appointment as Master of the Rolls in 1552 is more surprising; while not as important a judicial office as it later became, it was nonetheless one which called for a qualified lawyer, and Parker, as far as is known, had no legal training.Ball p.140  Dispute with the Earl of Sussex  Thomas Radclyffe, Earl of Sussex: Parker became his chief enemy in Irish politics Parker's later years were overshadowed by his bitter quarrel with the Lord Deputy, Thomas Radcliffe, 3rd Earl of Sussex. Initial relations between the two men seem to have been friendly enough: Parker entertained Sussex at Holmpatrick Abbey soon after the latter's arrival in Ireland, and they went together on an expedition against Shane O'Neill the next year.Ball p.206 By 1562 however their mutual hostility was a major factor in Irish politics. Sussex's policies, particularly his levying of taxes, had aroused much opposition in the Pale (i.e. the four eastern counties which were under secure English rule). Parker, despite being English himself, emerged as one of the leaders of \\"the gentlemen of the Pale\\" and used his judicial authority to declare that Sussex had exceeded his legal powers. Sussex in turn accused Parker of disloyalty to the Queen and of being the author of a scurrilous book vilifying him. Another source of contention was religion: Sussex, who had originally been appointed Lord Deputy by the devoutly Catholic Queen Mary I, was a very lukewarm Protestant: his first royal commission from Mary had included an injunction to suppress all Irish heretics and Lollards, and Parker, as an extreme Protestant reformer, had been obliged to seek a royal pardon for his recusancy.Ball p.206 After the accession of Elizabeth I, with the Protestant reformers once more dominant, Parker in turn accused Sussex of a lack of religious zeal. Parker's complaints against Sussex eventually caused the Queen to set up a Commission of Inquiry; the Commissioners were Sir Thomas Wroth and Sir Nicholas Arnold. Both of the Commissioners were like Parker strong Protestants, but unlike Parker they were not entirely unsympathetic to Sussex. The result of the inquiry was Sussex' recall to England, which he had been pressing for himself. Sussex developed a deep grievance against Arnold and later tried to impeach him, but without success. The Commissioners praised Parker for his religious zeal: whether this might have led to further career advancement is unknown, since he died the same year.Ball p.206  Family  Parker made an advantageous marriage to the twice widowed Marian St Lawrence, daughter of Nicholas St Lawrence, 4th Baron Howth, and mother through her first husband of Richard Nugent, 5th Baron Delvin, and of Nicholas Nugent, Chief Justice of the Irish Common Pleas. He had a son and a daughter. The noted Jacobite conspirator Colonel John Parker (c.1651-c.1719) and his son General Gervais Parker (1695-1750) were descended from him.  Character  Elrington Ball describes Parker as an extraordinary individual who from his modest beginning as a merchant in a small English town,despite having no legal training, rose to become a senior Irish statesman and judge,Ball, p.140 powerful enough to challenge the Earl of Sussex and able to win the respect of other leading figures in the Irish administration, such as Sussex's successor Nicholas Arnold.

Robinson is also the Chair of the Berkeley Center for Health Technology, which supports research and professional education projects related to coverage, management, and payment methods for innovative technologies including biopharmaceuticals, medical devices, and diagnostics. James Robinson's professional activities include his roles as Senior Director for Medical Technology at the Integrated Healthcare Association, Contributing Editor for Health Affairs journal, and as keynote speaker for conferences, policy roundtables, and board meetings.

He has published three books and over 120 papers in scientific and policy journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, and Health Affairs. ;Work regarding the Future of Commercial Insurance Profitability Robinson‚Äôs 2006 article, ‚ÄúThe Commercial Health Insurance Industry In An Era Of Eroding Employer Coverage‚Äù, discussed employment based coverage, once a mainstay of attracting employees, has declined. From a peak of covering approximately 164 million people in 2000, employers by 2004 covered approximately 159 million people. The insurance companies that employers utilized for health coverage felt the impact of the changing employer environment. Insurance companies, to maintain their profitability, turned to diversification of coverage, servicing private and public programs.http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/25/6/1475.full.html Can insurance companies maintain profitability in the years to come? Insurance companies still rely on the employer based book of business which is in constant flux with the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, some insurance companies need to reduce premiums due to regulatory pressures on excess revenue, the market place itself is changing from insured to self- insured, from comprehensive to high-deductible plan design. Insurance Industry profits have increased due to the result of increasing privatization of Medicaid and Medicare programs. A 2012 Bloomberg Government Study examined the financial performance of the five largest publicly traded health insurers by market capitalization. Quarterly revenue for Medicare business, of the insurers who reported, increased by almost one-third, from $12.55 billion to $16.39 billion with Medicaid revenue doubling from $2 billion to $4.11 billion in a period from fourth quarter 2008 through third quarter 2011. Government business now accounts for more than 40 percent with commercial business accounting for less than half of the total revenue.http://media.bloomberg.com/bb/avfile/r5leWxypfaX4 Drivers of change continue to include the changing role of employers and health coverage, where defined contribution is replacing traditional insurance benefits; increase enrollment in government sponsored health plans, where increases in Medicare Advantage plans and Part D Drug Discount Program enrollments are growing; implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), where 27 million additional people will be insured,http://dupress.com/articles/the-future-of-health-care- insurance-whats-ahead/ and consolidation. In 2011, there were 20 mergers and acquisitions within the managed care, totaling almost $8 billion, and after enactment of the ACA more consolidation took place than in each of the three previous years. Ultimately it will depend on whether the insurance industry can fulfill its value proposition of managing health costs without compromising safety and outcomes. Has privatization of the public health plans ensured success from a cost standpoint? A study conducted in 2013http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/IJHS- Medicare_Overpayments-5.10.13.pdf examined payments to private plans from the time of 1985 to 2013 and found that Medicare had overpaid private insurers by $282.6 billion, with an overpayment of $34.1 billion in 2012 alone. Private insurers utilize four strategies in dealing with Medicare beneficiaries: 1) cherry-picking healthier beneficiaries, through advertising, office location as examples, who cost less. Although all seniors who choose to enroll are accepted private plans induce sicker beneficiaries to disenroll by making expensive care inconvenient; 2) recruiting mild to sometimes serious beneficiaries which trigger higher premiums but don‚Äôt have expensive care; 3) enroll patients who receive majority of their care free through the Veterans Administration; and 4) lobby Congress to raise reimbursement. ;Work Regarding the Evolution of the Insurance Industry from Private to Public Coverage In his 2006 article, ‚ÄúThe Commercial Health Insurance Industry In An Era Of Eroding Employer Coverage‚Äù, Robinson discussed the dynamics of the insurance industry transforming from a largely private only venture to one that has a great deal of Publicly funded health care. Robinson argues that the majority of health insurance in the U.S. is now provided by large firms that cover individuals with private and publicly funded plans. Traditionally, health insurance was provided by an employer as a benefit to their employees. This system provided the majority of health insurance for the majority of the 20th century and peaked in the year 2000 with 164.4 million being covered by employer based plans. However, this figure then dropped by nearly 5 million in the next four years.Gould, E. (2013). Employer-sponsored health insurance coverage continues to decline in a new decade. International Journal of Health Services, 43(4), 603-638. The reduction in employer based coverage caused the insurance industry to adjust in order to stay profitable. Many smaller or less profitable firms merged with larger, more profitable firms to be able to offset some of the losses from employer based plans.Hyman, D. A., & Hall, M. (2013). Two Cheers For Employment-Based Health Insurance. Yale Journal of Health Policy, Law, and Ethics, 2(1), 2. The other major change has been the commercial sector embracing and moving into Medicaid and Medicare coverage to stay viable. This expansion into public programs has allowed the private insurance industry to grow despite the erosion of employment based coverage. Part of this success is due to state level budgetary constraints that have made them willing to transfer Financial risk and outsource the management requirements to a commercial carrier.Landon, B. E., Tobias, C., & Epstein, A. M. (1998). Quality management by state Medicaid agencies converting to managed care: Plans and current practice. JAMA, 279(3), 211-216. Retrieved from http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=187161 This relationship will ensure that the profitability of the commercial health insurance industry will be linked to the budgetary cycles and political fluctuations of state and federal governments. However, these budgetary pressures are not expected to affect Medicare for another half decade. ;Work Regarding the Recent Trends in Commercial Health Insurance One of Robinson‚Äôs research areas is related to the economics of health insurance. In the United States, the term health insurance is used to describe any program that helps patients pay for medical expenses. However, in contrast to other countries around the world, health insurance in the United States is available through multiple different programs including but not limited to privately purchased insurance, social insurance (Medicare) or a social welfare program (Medicaid) funded in joint by the state and federal government. The majority of Americans have private health insurance with a very large proportion of the private health insurance offered as part of an employee compensation packaged administered through the workplace. For example, in 2009, 169.7 million (87%) of the 194.5 million people with private coverage were getting their coverage from their employers.Folland, S., Goodman, A., & Stano, M. (2013). The economics of health and healthcare. (7th ed.). Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education. P.221 In a 2006 article published in Health Affairs , Robinson describes the landscape of the commercial insurance market and some of its potential barriers to growth and sustainability due to increasing external pressure.James C. Robinson. The Commercial Health Insurance Industry in an Era of Eroding Employer Coverage. Health Affairs, 25, no.6 (2006): 1475-1486 Some of these barriers to growth include its high dependency on employer-based insurance, inability to use pricing power due to cash rich non-profit Blues plans and the market trend towards consumer driven health benefit designs (also known as high deductible health plans) which transfer risk and reward between the consumer and the plan. What is equally concerning is that during the years 2001 through 2010, the rate of employment-based insurance coverage decreased due to rising health care costs placed on plans and employers. With an inability to strengthen their foothold in the now-decreasing employer based market, Robinson suggests that the commercial insurances‚Äô will use historical trends, perspective and economic principles of healthcare finance to overcome these challenges and sustain their growth in earnings. He also predicts the future earnings and profitability of the commercial health insurance industry to be dependent on their ability to anticipate and work through the political agenda and fiscal policies at both the state and federal levels. Under the provisions of the Affordable Care Act(ACA) the commercial health insurance industry has been granted important opportunities through the privately managed healthcare insurance exchanges and the expansion of the Medicaid program in many states.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, H.R. 3590, 111th Cong. (2010) There is also a growing desire of the public purchaser of health to outsource the difficult task of managing increasingly complicated patient care to the private sector which may be more efficient due to greater competitive pressures. However, the fate of the employer-based coverage market due to provisions in the ACA remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that the erosion of the employer-based health insurance may not continue as employers may be more incentivized to continue healthcare; the cost of coverage was $8,483 versus the actual cost of dropping active employee health benefits at $17,269.Congressional Budget Office. An Analysis of Health Insurance Premiums Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, p.28, table 2, November 30, 2009.Truven Health Analytics, July 2012 While additional year-end evidence is needed, the ACA does appear to increase the opportunities of expanded growth for the private sector in the individual, Medicaid, and Medicare markets.

Sia (born Calvin Chia Jung Sia, June 3, 1927 - August 19, 2020) was a primary care pediatrician from Hawaii who developed innovative programs to improve the quality of medical care for children in the United States and Asia. Two particular programs have been implemented throughout America: the Medical Home concept for primary care that has been promoted by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the federal Emergency Medical Services for Children program administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services‚Äô Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau. His Medical Home model for pediatric care and early childhood development began to take root in several Asian countries in 2003. Sia is also creator of Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program to prevent child abuse and neglect and co-founder of Hawaii's Zero to Three program and Healthy and Ready to Learn Center. The Hawaii Healthy Start program, which targets expecting and new parents who may be at risk of abusing or neglecting their children, became the model for the Healthy Families America home visiting program that the United States Department of Justice's Office of Justice Programs identified in 2010 as a \\"promising\\" approach to child abuse prevention. The Healthy and Ready to Learn Center was a three-year pilot project to initiate training and health delivery services in an integrated system of care, with pediatric residents and graduate students in social work and early childhood education working as a team. In addition, Sia spearheaded the creation of the Variety School for learning disabled children, a Honolulu- based educational institution for children ages 5 through 13. Sia retired from his Honolulu-based medical practice in 1996, after almost 40 years of treating patients, but continues to promote Medical Home and community pediatrics as professor of Pediatrics at the University of Hawaii John A. Burns School of Medicine. Although he retired as chairman of the American Medical Association Section Council on Pediatrics in 2007, a post he assumed in 1983, Sia continued to play a national role as an emeritus member of the executive committee of the National Center for Medical Home Implementation Project Advisory Committee, an organization he formerly served as chairman, for many years. He died at his Nuuanu home in Honolulu on Aug. 19, 2020. Education Sia is a 1945 graduate of Punahou School in Honolulu and a graduate of Dartmouth College in 1950. He received his medical degree at Western Reserve University School of Medicine in 1955 and did a general rotating internship as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army Medical Corps at William Beaumont Army Hospital in El Paso, Texas from 1955-1956. Sia then served his pediatric residency under Dr. Irvine McQuarrie at Kauikeolani Children's Hospital in Honolulu, and obtained his license to practice medicine in Hawaii in 1958. He was certified by the American Board of Pediatrics in 1960 and recertified in 1987. The University of Hawaii awarded Sia an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree in 1992. Public service =Early years= As a young practicing pediatrician, Sia joined the early cadre of American Academy of Pediatrics consultants for Head Start and Parent Child Centers in Hawaii in the 1960s and developed a strong interest in prenatal, neonatal, and postnatal causes of physical and mental disabilities in children. In a paper he presented in 1964 to the Hawaii Academy of Sciences on advances in neonatology, Sia cited progress in the care of premature babies but also noted that \\"completeness\\" of the first physical exam and the education of nurses to be on the alert for early signs of disabilities were possible ways to save newborns with previously lethal birth defects. He concluded by observing, \\"One of the basic problems will be in solving the causes and prevention of prematurity.\\" Inspired by one of his mentors, Dr. Robert E. Cooke, the Johns Hopkins pediatrician behind the creation of the Hopkins hospital's Kennedy Institute for Handicapped Children, Sia helped establish Hawaii's Variety School for Learning Disabilities in 1967 and served as chairman of its board of directors for many years. Sia broadened the scope of his community work to address all children with special health care needs. In the early 1970s, he invited Dr. C. Henry Kempe, founder of the Denver-based National Center for the Prevention and Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect, and Dr. Ray E. Helfer of Michigan‚Äîtwo pioneers in the identification and treatment of child abuse‚Äîto help him and a small group of child advocates develop a plan to prevent and treat child abuse and neglect in the islands. That effort netted one of the first 12 demonstration grant awards by the newly created National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect in 1975, with $1 million going to establish the first Hawaii Family Stress Center. The center, later renamed the Hawaii Family Support Center, established several child abuse and neglect programs on Oahu, including a home-visiting program based on Kempe's effective use of \\"lay therapists.\\" These were home visitors from the community, properly trained and supervised by public health nurses and social workers who could earn the trust of at-risk families and focus on family strengths to reduce environmental risk and prevent child abuse and neglect. The center's goal was to identify vulnerable families before their day-to-day stresses, isolation, and lack of parenting knowledge and good role models gave rise to abusive and neglectful behavior. The center's operations coincided with an effort launched by Dr. Vince L. Hutchins and Dr. Merle McPherson of the Maternal and Child Health Bureau in 1977 to revise and update the mission of the federal agency's Title V and companion \\"crippled children's\\" programs to address child development and the prevention of developmental, behavioral and psychosocial problems. McPherson took note of Sia's call for a continuous system of care originating with the primary care pediatrician. The AAP collaborated in this effort by asking each state's AAP chapter to develop a Child Health Plan that set priorities for using MCHB block grants. Sia spearheaded the Hawaii planning effort, bringing together representatives from the Hawaii AAP Chapter, the UH medical school, the Hawaii Medical Association, and Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children. Armed with anecdotal evidence showing home visitors were able to promote effective parenting and ultimately improve outcomes, the group wrote a plan that incorporated a coordinated system of care that emphasized wellness and prevention for children, especially those with special needs. This was the birth of the Medical Home concept for primary care, to which Sia attached the slogan, ‚ÄúEvery Child Deserves a Medical Home.‚Äù [https://jabsom.hawaii.edu/another-national-honor-for-pediatrics-visionary- calvin-sia-md/title=Another National Honor for Pediatrics Visionary Calvin Sia, MDpublisher=Amchp.orgaccessdate=20 February 2020}}}} Under this idea, which the American Academy of Pediatrics adopted as a policy statement in 1992, the medical care of all infants, children and adolescents should be accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-centered, coordinated, compassionate, and culturally effective. It should be delivered or directed by well-trained physicians who provide primary care and help to manage and facilitate essentially all aspects of pediatric care. The physician should be known to the child and family and should be able to develop a partnership of mutual responsibility and trust with them. As Sia and his co-authors of a 2006 monograph on the Medical Home noted, this new model broadens the traditional focus on acute care to include prevention and well care at one end of the continuum and chronic care management of children with special health care needs at the other. One expert observed, for example, that for a child born with spina bifida, Sia's Medical Home model would have the family and its health care provider compose a list of specialists and therapists who would be caring for the child and a timeline of anticipated surgeries and interventions. The aim would be to have as few emergencies and unanticipated events as possible. As the lead author of an often-cited article published by the journal Pediatrics in May 2004, Sia traced the development of the Medical Home concept. =Pilot programs= By 1984, Sia had begun to implement the Medical Home concept in Hawaii. As chairman of an ad hoc state legislative task force on child abuse, he persuaded Hawaii lawmakers to authorize the Hawaii Healthy Start Home Visiting Program for the prevention of child abuse and neglect. This state-funded pilot program, carried out by Hawaii Family Support Center in collaboration with the Hawaii Department of Health, focused on a neighborhood in the Ewa community on Oahu, a community with relatively high rates of child abuse and neglect. A year later, he spearheaded the Hawaii Medical Association's effort to obtain a grant from the U.S. Maternal and Child Health Bureau, under the Special Projects of Regional and National Significance (SPRANS) initiative, to train primary care physicians to provide a \\"Medical Home\\" for all children with special health care needs. The demonstration project‚Äîwhich sought to help first-time families give their newborn children the best start in life‚Äîwas so successful it was expanded from a small part of Oahu to other areas of Hawaii, and as word of the demonstrated positive outcomes spread, Hawaii's Healthy Start became a model for parenting education programs nationwide. In the early 1990s, Healthy Families America and the National Healthy Start Association began to standardize and credential programs to ensure effectiveness and research-based practices. Across the United States, according to the MCHB, the home visiting program has shown that it can reduce child maltreatment and increase children's readiness for school. Meanwhile, Sia launched the Hawaii Early Intervention Program for infants and toddlers in 1986 and also became actively involved with Hawaii's Early Intervention Coordinating Council for Zero to Three, placing this under Hawaii's Department of Health instead of the Department of Education. The focus of this effort was to support the Medical Home system of care with prevention and early intervention programs. =Implementation= At a June 1987 conference called by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and sponsored by the AAP and MCHB to address children with special needs, Sia and his delegation from Hawaii made a presentation of the Medical Home concept. Koop appeared to embrace it by issuing a report that endorsed a system of family-centered, community-based, coordinated care for children with special needs. This was followed in 1989 by the first National Medical Home Conference, which drew 26 AAP state chapters to Hawaii for presentations organized by Sia and MCHB officials on how to train pediatricians in the Medical Home system of care. This led to consultations to introduce the Medical Home training program to interdisciplinary teams of pediatricians, families, and other health care‚Äìrelated professionals in Florida, Minnesota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Washington and other states. The pace of activity prompted Sia to close his private medical practice in 1996 so he could devote his time as principal investigator on various early childhood grant projects promoting the Medical Home and its integrated system of care. He launched several initiatives with a MCHB Health Education Collaboration grant in support of interprofessional training in early childhood, a Carnegie Corporation of New York Starting Points planning grant in early childhood, and Consuelo Foundation of Hawaii's Healthy and Ready to Learn grant‚Äìall with the emphasis on integrating the continuum of care of the Medical Home with other health, family, and community services from a holistic approach. The MCHB funding enabled him to travel across the country to promote the Medical Home concept to various communities, state AAP chapters, family advocacy groups and state Title V maternal and child health officers. A three-year pilot project creating a Healthy and Ready to Learn Center in Hawaii began in 1992 and helped gauge the effectiveness of Sia's family-centered interprofessional collaboration approach. Lessons learned from this project were subsequently adopted by the Office of Children and Youth of the Governor's Office of Hawaii with Sia as Co-Principal Investigator. The Carnegie Corp. Starting Points grant then was assumed by the Good Beginnings Alliance in Hawaii. Sia, serving as chairman of the American Medical Association's Section Council on Pediatrics and other AMA- and AAP- related posts, used those platforms and his network of contacts with other groups to help introduce the Medical Home concept into the care of adults as well as children, although his primary focus has remained on pediatric care. In 2007, the AAP, American Academy of Family Physicians, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Physicians and the American Osteopathic Association adopted the Joint Principles of the Patient-Centered Medical Home that set a standard definition of a Medical Home. A year later, the AMA adopted the principles, which have since received support from over 700 member organizations of the Patient Centered Primary Care Collaborative, including primary care and specialty care societies, all major health plans and consumer organizations. In addition, the term Medical Home now regularly shows up in the literature of parent groups such as Family Voices, in family practice journals and on the websites of state public health and medical agencies. =Focus on Asia= Beginning in 2000, Sia expanded his efforts related to early child development and the Medical Home to Asia. In 2003, he created the Asia-US Partnership, a think tank based at the University of Hawaii medical school whose mission is to improve child health in Asia and the United States through cross-cultural exchanges with leaders in pediatrics. That same year, Sia initiated and chaired the first of several AUSP Early Child Development and Primary Care conferences, bringing together pediatric and early childhood development experts from Asia and the United States to translate the science of early child development into policy and action. Participants have come from China (Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong), the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand and the United States. According to conference reports, these international exchanges have stimulated translation of the science on early child development and primary care into action programs in the broad areas of advocacy, service delivery, research, and training among the Asian early childhood professionals leadership. Sia has continued to serve as co-chairman of these events, including the sixth international conference, held in the Philippines capital of Manila, in May 2011. After hosting the earliest AUSP conferences in Hawaii, Sia decided to move the 2009 event to Shanghai and tapped a team of Chinese doctors to serve as conference host, signaling what he called a new phase of activity aimed at developing greater shared leadership and stronger \\"country teams.\\" =Pediatric emergency medicine= While planting the seeds of the Medical Home concept in Hawaii, Sia embarked on a related advocacy campaign focused on emergency care for children. In 1979, as president of the Hawaii Medical Association, Sia urged members of the American Academy of Pediatrics to develop multifaceted Emergency Medical Services programs designed to decrease disability and death in children. By January 1981, AAP's Executive Board had approved formation of a Section on Emergency Medicine, with Sia as one of its seven charter members. He along with Jos√© B. Lee then-executive officer of the Hawaii Medical Association Emergency Medical Services Program began working closely with Senator Daniel Inouye, whom he happened to meet on a flight to Washington, D.C., to create a National Emergency Medical Services for Children System (EMSC) demonstration grant program to address acute injuries, illnesses and other childhood crises. The program was launched after the October 1984 enactment of EMSC legislation (Public Law 98-555), a bipartisan measure sponsored by Inouye and Republican Senators Orrin Hatch of Utah and Lowell Weicker of Connecticut and endorsed by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. States receiving these demonstration grants established an emergency medical care service system for children that upgraded training and equipment for first responders and emergency departments to treat children. Hawaii ultimately received a grant to initiate its own emergency care system for children, which improved care coordination with the primary care physician. EMSC is now an established statewide system of care for children in all 50 states and territories. Honors and awards Several national and state organizations have recognized Sia for developing innovative and responsive family-centered grassroots services. Among the awards he has received are these: * 2015 Barbara Starfield Primary Care Leadership Award from the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative, acknowledging \\"his legendary work leading and promoting the medical home movement across the pediatric community and beyond.\\" * 2012 University of Hawaii Serving Heart Award. * 2010 U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration 75th Anniversary Director's Award to Champions In The Field Of Maternal And Child Health In The States And Jurisdictions. * 2009 Punahou School's Samuel Chapman Award recognizing an individual who has made outstanding contributions in the fields of public service, humanitarian or charitable efforts, arts, letters or sciences, which have gained the awardee significant national or international recognition. * 2005 Establishment of the Calvin C.J.

Brunswick Library: early history On April 13, 1883 a group of citizens gathered in Skating Rink Hall at Maine and Elm streets to form the Brunswick Library Association.Library journal, Volume 10, p. 353 By December of that year, a room had been located in the Storer Block downtown, $1,200 was in hand, and Mr. Lyman E. Smith, the treasurer of the Library Association, had been hired as the librarian at a weekly salary of $4.Maine register or state year-book and legislative manual, p. 279 On February 4, 1884, with about 1,300 books on its shelves, the Brunswick Library opened. A life membership cost $3, and for an annual fee of $1 members could take books out of the library. Any resident could use the library at no cost if books were not taken out. In March 1884 the town voted to give the library a room in the new Town Hall, rent free, and to provide it with furniture, heat and lighting.A history of the public library in Brunswick, Maine by Louise R. Helmreich. A more significant form of assistance came in 1886, after the State Legislature agreed to allow the Town of Brunswick to grant the library an annual subsidy. The legislative act also stated that the library could not be controlled by the town, thereby making the library‚Äôs management free of political influence. The library has thus received continuous, and increasing, financial support from the town since 1886 and for many years depended on that support of the bulk of its revenue. Carnegie and Curtis In 1902, having despaired of a local donor, the president of the Library Association, Professor Franklin Robinson, wrote a letter to Andrew Carnegie. Carnegie agreed to give the Town of Brunswick $12,000, and Samuel G. Davis, whose generosity later provided the town with the Davis Fund, agreed to donate a lot on School Street. William J. Curtis, a Brunswick native, Bowdoin College graduate and successful New York City lawyer, was among the many people who read of Carnegie‚Äôs gift, and when he did, he immediately wrote Carnegie and asked him to withdraw his offer. Carnegie agreed to withdraw. Curtis provided $15,000 and a lot on Pleasant and Middle Streets. Although the library would belong to the town, its ‚Äúcare, custody, and management‚Äù would be given to the directors of the Brunswick Public Library Association. Ground was broken in August 1903, and 16 months later, on December 8, 1904, the Curtis Memorial Library was dedicated and opened to the public. 1973 expansion By the late 1960s, the small-town library that had been largely sustained since its beginnings by volunteers and private gifts had metamorphosed into a modern, professionally staffed library, supported primarily by town appropriations. The building that had been erected for a population of 6,800 now served 18,000. A municipal bond issue for the library addition was approved by referendum in April 1971, and ground was broken on May 30, 1972. The $500,000 addition opened November 12, 1973. 1997 expansion In December 1996, a town-appointed building committee selected the Boston firm Amsler, Woodhouse and MacLean to design a new library. The library was temporarily relocated to the old Brunswick High School in June 1997, and within a few weeks construction and renovation were underway at Pleasant Street.http://www.brunswickme.org/council/minutes/Minutes/1996-1998/97feb18.pdf References External links * Official website * Town of Brunswick Category:Library buildings completed in 1904 Category:Public libraries in Maine Category:Libraries in Cumberland County, Maine Category:Buildings and structures in Brunswick, Maine Category:Education in Brunswick, Maine Category:Tourist attractions in Brunswick, Maine ","title":"Curtis Memorial Library (Brunswick, Maine)"},{"id":"33681118","title":"Daisurami Bonne"},{"id":"33681126","text":"Gandhi delivering a speech on World Intellectual property Day 2018 Sanjai Gandhi is an attorney at law specializing at intellectual property rights.The right path, The Hindu, 5 September 2010 Gandhi had been instrumental in getting protection under Geographical Indication (protection & Registration) Act, 1999 for 10 Geographical indications (GI) for the state of Tamil Nadu, India.IPR attorney helps get 10 products GI status, The Times of India The products for which IPR attorney Sanjai Gandhi has obtained GI protection are: Kancheepuram Silk Sarees, Bhavani Jamukkalam (bedsheet), Madurai Sungudi Saree, Salem White Silk, Kovai Kora Cotton, Arni Silk, Thanjavur Paintings, Thanjavur Dancing Doll, Ethomozhi Tall Coconut of Kanyakumari district and Tangalia Shawl of Gujarat.

In a career which lasted from July 1926 to June 1927, he ran seven times winning four races. His most notable success came in the 1927 Epsom Derby, which he won in record time. Partly because of the death of his owner, Call Boy never ran again after his win at Epsom. Background Call Boy, a chestnut horse with a white blaze and two white socks, was bred by his owner, the actor and theatre manager Frank Curzon at his Primrose Cottage Stud. He was sired by the unbeaten champion, Hurry On, making him a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Apart from Call Boy, Hurry On sired the winners of seven Classics including the Derby winners Captain Cuttle and Coronach. Call Boy's dam, Comedienne, a daughter of the Irish Derby winner Bachelor's Double, had been bought by Curzon for 130gns. In addition to Call Boy, she produced the Great Yorkshire Stakes winner Comedy King. Curzon sent Call Boy to be trained by Jack Watts at his Lansdowne House Stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career =1926: two-year-old season= Call Boy made his racecourse debut in the prestigious July Stakes at Newmarket in which he finished third to The Satrap and Sickle. In the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster he produced a strong finish to reverse the form with Sickle but narrowly failed to catch Damon. At Newmarket in October he recorded his first win in the Linton Stakes and then returned to the same course later in the month for the Middle Park Stakes, one of the most important two-year-old races of the season. Call Boy established himself as one of the year's leading juveniles by winning by a head from Sickle. In the Free Handicap, an annual rating of the best British two-year- olds, Call Boy was ranked fifth. =1927: three-year-old season= Frank Curzon, Call Boy's owner and breeder c. 1900 On his three-year-old debut Call Boy started favourite for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, despite the fact that he was \\"evidently backward in condition\\", but was beaten a short head by Adam's Apple. In the days before the photo finish was introduced results were decided solely by the judge, and on this occasion there were some who felt that Call Boy had been unlucky not to have been given at least a share of the prize. On his next start, Call Boy was an impressive four length winner of the Newmarket Stakes, over ten furlongs. Although the opposition was moderate, his performance suggested that he would be well suited by longer distances. At Epsom, Call Boy started the 4/1 favourite, despite a slight injury scare, and was ridden by Charlie Elliott. The race took place on a wet and \\"dismal\\" day in front of a crowd which included the King and Queen as well as the aviator Charles Lindbergh. Call Boy led from the start but was strongly challenged in the straight by Hot Night. After being briefly headed inside the final furlong, Call Boy rallied to retake the lead and pulled away to win by two lengths from Hot Night, with the pair eight lengths clear of the third-placed Shian Mor. His winning time of 2:34.4 broke the race record set five years earlier by Captain Cuttle. Curzon who attended the race against doctor's advice, was obviously unwell (\\"pale and trembling\\"), but managed to lead the colt in and accepted the winner's trophy. Frank Curzon died shortly after the Derby. Under the rules of racing at the time, this meant that all of his entries for the rest of the season were void. Call Boy was bought by Curzon's brother, Sir Henry Mallaby-Deeley for ¬£60,000, but no new entries were made and Call Boy was retired to stud. . Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Call Boy an \\"average\\" Derby winner and the one hundred and fifty-second best British racehorse of the 20th Century . Stud career Call Boy's stud career was a complete failure. He had serious fertility problems and sired only a handful of foals, none of whom showed any real ability. In 1932, for example, he managed to get only four mares \\"in foal\\". His only notable descendant was the 1000 Guineas and Oaks winner Sweet Solera. Call Boy died on 4 October 1939.

Lydia agrees to raise the baby with him, naming her Faith and keeping her existence a secret from Jennifer, and quickly bonds with the child. She notices how great Skip is with the care of Faith, and once she tells Jennifer the truth, she criticizes her for giving Skip a bad treatment. Slowly, the baby brings spirit to the lives of Lydia and Skip. Then one night, Skip's friends from the past break in, only to be caught by Skip, who has alarmed the police. Chris, among the two friends, feels betrayed by Skip and claims that Skip was in on the crime when the police arrive. Not only is Skip arrested, but the baby is taken in as well. In jail, he finds out that the baby's mother wants her child back, upsetting Skip for feeling that he is now her father. Jennifer, who now takes a liking in Skip, bails him out and decides to help him demand custody of Faith. Skip, however, fears that he will lose the battle, and decides to give up, both disappointing Jennifer and Lydia. Throughout the film, in flashbacks, the viewer learns that Lydia (Janaya Stephens) made mistakes in the past as well as Skip. She was once a lustful young woman with many men in her lives, including the married father of one of her friends. She then married a family friend, Benny (Diego Klattenhoff) when she got into trouble, and gave birth to his daughter Meredith at age 19. Sometime later, Benny was killed in action, leaving Lydia heartbroken at home, while her brother Sunny (Marcus Hutchings) committed suicide after revealing to Lydia that he had lost his true love. Back in the present, Lydia processes Skip's rejection and finds through a letter that Sunny was a closeted homosexual man in love with Benny. Skip hands over the baby to the true mother in the presence of Lydia, who in a speech announces that the young lady does not deserve to be her mother. The next morning, she dies in her chair while thinking about her past with Sunny and Benny. Skip inherits the garage including its contents, such as a Cadillac and boxes filled with $70,000.

CBS News, February 11, 2009. In an interview with CBS, Moore expressed her interest: \\"Without even thinking that I would be playing that. I mean, you know, for my age, mid-60s to..., 82 it is a stretch. But I thought I could handle it, especially after doing The Gin Game with Dick Van Dyke where I played a woman in her early 80s. I was just so challenged and fascinated by this script, which takes you through some emotional things and some funny things. But primarily it doesn't tie up every little frayed ending into a neat little bow and it leaves you gasping.\\" The film was shot in Nova Scotia in the summer of 2003.

The mineral rights are owned by the South African miner Metorex. Resource The Musoshi ore body is the northern extension into the DRC of the Zambian Konkola North ore body. It is located to the north west of Kasumbalesa. It is a typical \\"Ore Shale\\" deposit, hosted in a fine-grained siltstone / argillaceous sandstone. The ore body dips steeply in the upper levels. It thins to the east and west to widths of to . Early operations A Japanese consortium operated the mine from 1968 to 1983. They developed a vertical mine shaft as well as underground workings and ground- level infrastructure. A surface-level concentrator had a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes per year. At its peak, in 1976 the mine produced 1.67 million tonnes of ore graded at 2.5% copper, equivalent to 38,000 tonnes of finished copper. The concentrator was also used to process ore from the Kinsenda Mine, away. The mine was closed and the concentrator placed on care-and-maintenance in the early 1990s due to low copper prices and lack of accessible resources. After strike action by the labor union the concentrator was mothballed and the mine allowed to flood. Musoshi has an inferred resource below the lowest working level of 24 million tons at 2.4% copper, or 576,000 tons of contained copper. Recent activity In 2007, Metorex acquired 38.7% of Copper Resources Corporation from the Forrest Group, as well as 5% of Miniere de Mushoshi et Kinsenda (MMK). After completing the acquisition and reopening Musoshi mine, it was expected to produce up to 12,000 tonnes annually. Due to a Title Revisitation Process initiated by the DRC government, in February 2009, it was confirmed that the Musoshi mine would be returned to the state- owned Sodimico. In October 2010 a South Korean consortium of Taejoo Synthesis Steel, Samsung, Hyundai and Daewoo said it was willing to revive the Mushoshi mine.

On 24 September 1959, the aircraft crashed during its departure from Bordeaux‚ÄìM√©rignac Airport, France when it flew into trees. All of the flight crew and 45 of the 56 passengers on board were killed; the other 11 passengers were seriously injured. Accident The DC-7C arrived at Bordeaux from Paris, making a scheduled stop on its route to West Africa. Following a two-hour stopover, departure from Bordeaux took place at 22:33 GMT. Weather at the time of departure was a wind and light drizzle that did not significantly restrict visibility. Following takeoff, the aircraft reached an altitude of , and failed to climb further before flying into a pine forest located from the end of the runway. The aircraft cut a swath through the forest; some of the passengers were thrown clear of the wreckage as the fuselage broke up, before being destroyed in a post-crash fire. Because of the darkness and a lack of roads in the accident area, rescue workers had difficulty reaching the scene of the crash; their vehicles were unable to approach closer than to the impact site. Twelve survivors were taken to a hospital in Bordeaux; one later died despite medical care, bringing the total number of deaths caused by the crash to 54. Aircraft The aircraft involved in the accident, registered F-BIAP, was a Douglas DC-7C airliner powered by four Wright R-3350-30W radial piston engines. Delivered new to Transports A√©riens Intercontinentaux on 9 November 1957, it carried manufacturer's serial number 45366. Probable cause The Investigation Board appointed to determine the cause of the crash reported that the accident was most likely caused by a combination of factors. Evidence from a reconstructed flight showed that with an increase in speed for a few seconds, the rate of climb of the aircraft will decrease; with a lack of visual references \\"a pilot may follow a line of flight that will bring the aircraft back near the ground if, during this period, optimum climbing speed is not maintained and the altimeter is not carefully watched\\".

The building probably dates from the 15th century, with some alterations. It contains a 12th-century carved stone font and a 13th-century decorated coffin lid. The bell is inscribed with the year of its casting, 1582. The historian Henry Rowlands was vicar of St Mary's in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Maurice Wilks, who invented the Land Rover, is buried in the churchyard. Although at one time during the 19th century St Mary's was too dilapidated to permit services to be held, repairs were carried out in the 19th century. The church is used for worship by the Church in Wales, one of five in a combined parish. Services are held once per month between April and September. St Mary's is a Grade II* listed building, a national designation given to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\", in particular because it is regarded as \\"a good example of a simple, substantially unaltered, late Medieval church\\". It is also said to be \\"an important survival\\" because many of the older churches in Anglesey were extensively rebuilt or repaired during the 19th century, and the alterations at St Mary's were less extensive. History and location St Mary's Church is located in a churchyard about from the road in the countryside near the village of Dwyran, in Anglesey, north Wales. The church is about from the county town of Llangefni, and just under 1 mile (1.5 km) from the neighbouring church of St Ceinwen's, Llangeinwen. Llanfair-yn-y- Cwmwd takes its name in part from the church: the Welsh word originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", and \\"‚Äëfair\\" is a modified form of the patron saint's name (Mair being the Welsh for \\"Mary\\", here referring to St Mary, the mother of Jesus). Cwmwd means \\"commote\\" (a type of Welsh land division), so the full name of the parish means \\"St Mary's Church in the commote\\". The date of construction of the church is uncertain, but it is a medieval building, probably from the 15th century. The 19th-century clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones thought that the church was probably 16th-century in date, but might have been built using material from an older structure. The historian Antony Carr has suggested that Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd was the church dedicated to St Mary that was sacked by Normans in 1157. St Mary's was formerly one of the chapels of ease to St Nidan's, Llanidan, along with St Deiniol's, Llanddaniel Fab and St Edwen's, Llanedwen. St Nidan's and its chapels were owned by the Augustinian priory at Beddgelert, Gwynedd; the date of transfer is uncertain, since not all the records have survived, but St Nidan's is mentioned as belonging to the priory in a charter of 1360. Carr has written that \\"we shall never know\\" how the \\"distant community\\" in Beddgelert came to possess the four Anglesey churches, but thought that it might be significant that the priory also controlled two churches on the mainland, on the other side of the Menai Strait. During the 16th century, the windows of the nave had mullions (stonework supporting the window structure) added, and the roof trusses date from later in the same century (or early in the following century). In her 1833 history of Anglesey, the antiquarian Angharad Llwyd said that the church had been \\"for years in a state of such dilapidation as to preclude the performance of divine service\\", but she noted that it was being rebuilt at that time. However, compared to other churches in Anglesey, the 19th-century changes were not substantial. Repairs were undertaken in 1936 under the supervision of the architects Harold Hughes and William G. Williams. St Mary's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales. A service of Holy Communion (in Welsh) is held on one Sunday afternoon per month between April and September; no services are held during the rest of the year. It is one of five churches in the combined benefice (parishes combined under one priest) of Newborough with Llanidan with Llangeinwen and Llanfair-yn-y-Cymwd. St Mary's is within the deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2012, the priest in charge of the group of parishes is E. Roberts. People associated with the church include Henry Rowlands, a clergyman and antiquarian. He was the incumbent priest of St Nidan's and its chapels of ease from 1696 until his death in 1723, and wrote a history of Anglesey, Mona Antiqua Restaurata. Maurice Wilks, who invented the Land Rover, is buried in the churchyard. He had a farm nearby in Newborough and some prototype testing of the Land Rover was carried out in Anglesey. Architecture and fittings The church is built from rubble masonry, dressed with sandstone, and measures . The entrance is at the west end of the north wall. The roof, which is made from slate, has a bellcote with one bell at the west end. The inscription on the bell states that it was cast in 1582, and the bell is also marked with a fleur-de-lys and the thrice-repeated initials \\"AMN\\". Inside, although there is no structural division between the nave and the chancel, there is a 19th-century wooden screen with wrought-iron gates between them, and a step up into the chancel. The sanctuary is marked with a further step, as is the base of the altar; both steps are decorated with encaustic tiles. The internal woodwork of the roof, which has seven bays (or sections), is exposed. Coffin lid on N wall of chancel. Drawn by Harry Longueville Jones, Archaeologia Cambrensis, 1846 pg 394 The window in the centre north wall has two lights (sections of window separated by a mullion); there are two pairs of two-light windows in the south wall. The window at the east end had a pair of lights, topped by trefoils (a stonework pattern of three overlapping circles). The roughly oval gritsone font at the west end of the nave, which is from the 12th century, has a zig-zag pattern, and three sides decorated with a cross. The base of the font, which is rectangular with rounded corners, has misshapen carved human heads at the corners and in the middle of one side, and a snake on two of the sides. A \\"P\\"-shaped sign on the east side of the font may have been added later. St Mary's has a coffin lid dating from the middle of the 13th century, displayed upside down on the north wall of the chancel. It is decorated with a carved cross and a foliage design. One 19th-century visitor noted another three old plain coffin lids on the church floor, with another in the churchyard near the east window. As well as an 18th-century slate plaque on the south wall of the nave, there are also various memorials from the 19th and 20th centuries. Assessment The gravestone of Maurice Wilks at the east end of the church The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II* listed building ‚Äì the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". It was given this status on 30 January 1968, and has been listed because it is regarded as \\"a good example of a simple, substantially unaltered, late Medieval church.\\" Cadw (the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that many old churches in Anglesey were rebuilt or restored during the 19th century, and that St Mary's \\"can be considered an important survival.\\" Writing in 1846, Harry Longueville Jones said that St Mary's was \\"one of the smallest buildings of its class in the island\\" and had \\"no feature of any architectural value.\\" He noted the \\"elaborate\\" coffin lid, and said that the font (a \\"rude production of the twelfth century\\") was \\"one of the most remarkable in the collection of Anglesey monuments\\". The historian and clergyman Edmund Tyrrell Green, writing a survey of Anglesey church architecture and contents in 1929, referred to the coffin lid as one of the county's \\"outstanding examples\\" of sepulchral memorials. A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey describes St Mary's as \\"a good example of a small unspoilt country church.\\" It notes the \\"simple\\" rood screen and the \\"well- maintained\\" churchyard. A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region refers to the church as a \\"small unicameral church of undeterminable date\\" and says that the font, on its \\"strangely carved rectangular base\\", is \\"inconsistent\\" with the Romanesque fonts found elsewhere in Anglesey References External links *Parish website *Photographs of the church Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd, St Mary Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd, St Mary Category:15th-century church buildings in Wales Category:Rhosyr ","title":"St Mary's Church, Llanfair-yn-y-Cwmwd"},{"id":"33681616","text":"Richard Mwanza (5 May 1959 ‚àí 27 April 1993) was a Zambian footballer and member of the national team.

Mwitwa was part of the Kabwe Warriors team that won their first Zambian Super league championship in 15 years in the 1987 soccer season but got demoted the following year. The club also won the Champion of Champions Cup the same season under coach Bizwell Phiri. Mwitwa featured for the Kabwe Warriors squad that participated in the African Cup of Champions Clubs in 1988, where they were knocked out in the second round by Al Hilal of Sudan. Mwitwa was sent off early on in the first half of the second leg tie in Omdurman, with Warriors going on to lose 1 - 3, having held Al Hilal 0 - 0 in the first leg in Kabwe. Warriors played in the lower first division in the 1988 season, losing only one game to Monze Swallows and were promoted right back to the Super Division the following year. Most soccer pundits expected Warriors to lose most of their star players (including Mwitwa, goal keeper Richard Mwanza, defenders Whiteson Changwe, Samuel Chomba and James Chitalu among others) but the club managed to hold on to all their players, a feat that is attributed to their promotion at first attempt.

The first station was located some distance from the town, on the Dingwall and Skye Railway line, and was opened in 1870. Seasonal visitors to Strathpeffer increased considerably in numbers, and a branch line to Strathpeffer itself was opened in 1885; the earlier station was renamed Achterneed. Tourism increased considerably, but the First World War interrupted the leisure development, and it never recovered after the war. In 1946 the second Strathpeffer station was closed to passengers. The earlier station, now called Achterneed, continued in use, being located on a through line, but it closed in 1964. First station Strathpeffer station from 1870On 5 July 1865 the Dingwall and Skye Railway was authorised by Act of Parliament; it was an ambitious scheme to build westwards from Dingwall on the Inverness and Ross-shire Railway to Kyle of Lochalsh on the west coast opposite the Isle of Skye. The part of the route at the eastern end was planned to follow relatively easy terrain, passing through Strathpeffer to Contin, then turning north through the valley of the Black Water to pass Loch Garve.H A Vallance, C R Clinker, Anthony J Lambert, The Highland Railway, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1985, Sir William MacKenzie of Coul House had opposed the railway on the grounds of loss of privacy at his residence, but Parliament had not upheld his objections. He was implacably opposed to the construction of the railway nearby, and demanded that the line should be built in tunnel throughout the crossing of his lands, an arrangement that the promoters of the line thought impracticable and unaffordable. MacKenzie continued his opposition in such a way that construction could not proceed, and at length the Dingwall and Skye company obtained a second Act, on 5 July 1865,Date from Ross; Vallance et al say 29 May 1868. authorising an alternative route. As the proposed line approached Strathpeffer it turned sharply northwards, at the location that later became Fodderty Junction, climbing at 1 in 50 to a local summit at the Raven's Rock (458 feet), there continuing west to meet the originally intended route. These arrangements increased the cost of construction of the line, and made operation more difficult.Mark Higginson, Rails to Strathpeffer, in Railway Magazine, March 1980 Strathpeffer was the largest community on the line of route, with a population of 2,247 in 1861.John Thomas and David Turnock, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: Volume 15: North of Scotland, David & Charles (Publishers), Newton Abbot, 1989, Notwithstanding the deviation, it was given a station, although this was about two miles north of the town at the top of a steep hill. The line opened to goods traffic on 5 August 1870 and to passengers on 19 August 1870, and this Strathpeffer station opened at the same time. The line was worked by the Highland Railway. Sir William MacKenzie died before the line opened, and his heir was friendly towards railways.David Ross, The Highland Railway, Tempus Publishing Limited, Stroud, 2005, When the second \\"Strathpeffer\\" station opened, this first station was renamed Achterneed. It closed on 7 December 1964, outliving the second Strathpeffer station.M E Quick, Railway Passenger Stations in England Scotland and Wales‚ÄîA Chronology, The Railway and Canal Historical Society, 2002 Achterneed station is said to have re-opened as a private unstaffed halt on 8 February 1965, and closed again in 1968.David McConnell, Rails to Kyle of Lochalsh: Story of the Dingwall and Skye Railway Including the Strathpeffer Branch, Oakwood Press, Usk, 1997, Ewan Crawford, The Kyle of Lochalsh Line, Amberley Publishing, Stroud, 2014, Second station The second station at Strathpeffer from 1885Strathpeffer had numerous chalybeate mineral water springs, as well as the strongest sulphur springs in the country; these were considered to be an important health aid, and the spa facilities developed in connection with taking the waters attracted considerable numbers of visitors. The inconvenient location of the station was a considerable disadvantage, and the Highland Railway were approached to build a line to the town itself. They agreed to do this, and obtained Parliamentary authority in a New Lines Act of 28 July 1884,; they constructed a branch line from Fodderty, where a junction was made with the Skye line, continuing west to the margin of Strathpeffer along the route originally intended for that part of the Dingwall and Skye line. The branch opened on 3 June 1885;John Thomas, Forgotten Railways: Scotland, David and Charles (Publishers) Limited, Newton Abbot, 1976, it was a single line. The earlier Strathpeffer station remained open, but was renamed Achterneed.Higginson says that the first station was renamed to Achterneed two days before the opening of the new station. A 2-2-2 locomotive dating from 1865 was allocated to work the branch; it was given a second-hand boiler to replace its own. It was formerly named Breadalbane it was renamed Strathpeffer. For the remainder of the nineteenth century the passenger rolling stock was ancient Highland Railway four-wheelers. The new Stathpeffer station was elaborately designed. Higginson describes it: > A gabled canopy, supported on cast iron columns, extended its full length > while inside extensive offices and waiting rooms were to be found. A bow > fronted gable, embellished with intricate bargeboards, served to relieve the > otherwise plain frontage which faced onto a wide and sweeping approach. A standard goods shed was provided, and there was a stone house for the station master. A new bay platform for the Strathpeffer trains was provided at Dingwall. The twentieth century The Highland Railway belatedly set about building its own hotel in the town, but that did not open until 1911. Strathpeffer experienced a remarkable increase in seasonal visitors, and with the Highland Railway hotel there were more than 500 hotel bedrooms in the town, more than anywhere else on the Highland Railway system except Inverness and Pitlochry. The town was named The Harrogate of the North by the Weekly Scotsman newspaper. In 1908 - 1909 a through sleeping carriage service from London to Strathpeffer had been run, going forward from Inverness on the 9:50 am Wick train, which detached a portion for Strathpeffer at Dingwall. With the opening of the Highland Railway hotel, the Company started running a Tuesdays- only train in summer, the Strathpeffer Spa Express. It ran northbound only, from Aviemore and stopped only at Dingwall, using the Rose Street spur at Inverness to avoid the station there. This train ran from 1911 until it was suspended during World War I in 1915. It left Aviemore at 2:15 pm, connecting out of a Perth to Inverness via Forres express train, and it arrived in Strathpeffer at 4:15 pm. Remains of station 1956. After the Armistice in 1918, the town never resumed its former importance as a tourist centre, and the passenger train service treated the line as a simple branch line. With the development of reliable road transport, the usage of the passenger service declined steeply in the 1930s, and on 26 March 1946Ross says 2 March 1946 on page 88, but this must be a mistake. the passenger service was withdrawn. A limited goods service continued, but that too succumbed to road competition, and the branch closed completely on 26 March 1951.Hurst, 1991, page 5 although closure was not made official until 12 August 1951.Butt, 1995, page 222 Train services 1899 map showing the line to Strathpeffer from Fodderty Junction, and Achterneed stationThe passenger train service to Strathpeffer was designed to connect at Dingwall with trains between Inverness and the far north, and Kyle of Lochalsh. In December 1895, there were seven passenger trains each way over the five-mile long route from Dingwall. The journey time was ten minutes, with no intermediate stops. The first train reached Strathpeffer at 7.50 a.m. and the last at 5.42 p.m. The first departure for Dingwall was at 8.40 a.m. and the last at 8.10 p.m.Bradshaw, 1895, p. 586 In July 1922, six passenger trains were operated each way. The first train left Dingwall for Strathpeffer at 8.20 a.m. and the last at 6.15 p.m. In the other direction, the first train left Strathpeffer for Dingwall at 9.00 a.m. and the last at 6.35 p.m.Bradshaw, 1922, page 868 The Highland Railway was a constituent of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMSR) from 1 January 1923, under the Railways Act 1921. The frequency of the branch line passenger train service was reduced by the LMSR during World War II, and in October 1942 four trains were operated in each direction. The first Strathpeffer train left Dingwall at 7.53 a.m. and the last at 4.00 p.m. The first train to Dingwall left Strathpeffer at 8.30 a.m. and the last left at 4.30 p.m. In 1922 and 1942, no trains were operated on Sundays.Bradshaw, 1942, page 751 Locomotives The first locomotive, Strathpeffer, was a 2-2-2 and was underpowered even for the easy gradients of the branch. In 1890 the Highland Railway locomotive engineer David Jones designed an 0-4-4 saddle tank design; the new Strathpeffer was given a second-hand boiler from another 2-2-2, and in 1901 it was altered to a side-tank configuration. In 1903 it was transferred to work the Wick and Lybster Light Railway. That engine was replaced by a third Strathpeffer, a similar 0-4-4 tank design built at Inverness. Numerous other visiting engines appeared on the branch, including the elegant \\"Loch\\" class 4-4-0s designed by David Jones, which worked the Strathpeffer expresses. A Sentinel steam railcar was allocated to the branch for a period; it was no 4349, built in 1927 and scrapped in 1939, but it is not known to have been on the branch throughout that time span. Highland Museum of Childhood The old railway station building currently performs an important role in the town's tourist trade and cultural activities. It houses the Highland Museum of Childhood, several retail shops and a cafe. When it opened in 1992, this became the fourth museum of childhood in Britain. Initially, the museum was based on the doll and toy collection of former Strathpeffer resident, Mrs Angela Kellie but subsequently expanded to tell the story of childhood in the Scottish Highlands. It rented space in Strathpeffer's restored Victorian railway station building and by 2007 had an average of 8,500 visitors a year. In 2009 a board of trustees purchased the station building from Highland Council. The museum is independent and fully accredited via Museums Galleries Scotland; it operates as a company limited by guarantee with charitable status. It became a registered charity from 1 January 1992. The museum tells the story of childhood in the Highlands of Scotland, using photographic collections, interpretive displays and artefacts. The collections include dolls, toys, games, children's costumes and childhood furniture. Themes include Birth and Baptism, Homelife, Health and Nutrition, Leisure, Child Labour and Education. There is an award-winning oral-history film, \\"A Century of Highland Childhood\\"; Railway restoration project A locally based group has outlined plans for restoration of steam train services to Strathpeffer, starting with an initial one-mile length of track. It later hopes to extend the track to reach the existing main line.Strathpeffer Village Website: Victorian railway station References Notes Other references  * * Category:Former Highland Railway stations Category:Disused railway stations in Ross and Cromarty Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1885 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1946 Category:Listed railway stations in Scotland Category:Category B listed buildings in Highland (council area) ","title":"Strathpeffer railway station"},{"id":"33681641","text":"Robert Watiyakeni (died April 27, 1993) was a Zambian footballer and member of the national team.

It is considered to be part of the post-cubism movement. \\"Fronte Nuovo delle Arti\\" was founded in September-October 1946 with the name Nuova Secessione Artistica Italiana (New Italian Artistic Secession). The first manifesto was published on 1 October 1946 in Venice. It was written by Giuseppe Marchiori and signed by Emilio Vedova, Renato Birolli, Ennio Morlotti, Armando Pizzinato, Giuseppe Santomaso, Alberto Viani, Bruno Cassinari, Renato Guttuso, Leoncillo Leonardi and Carlo Levi. Later on, Guttuso proposed to change the name of the movement to Fronte Nuovo delle Arti. The reasoning for this group of artists and critics to develop the ideas leading to the formation of the Fronte was to go beyond the positions of the movement Novecento italiano, who were deemed as outdated in light of the most recent artistic developments in Europe. Fronte Nuovo delle Arti had a number of exhibitions in Italy but it disbanded after an intense internal debate about abstraction and realism. Pizzinato and Guttuso rejected abstractionism and announced their decision to quit. The movement was officially dissolved on 3 September 1950 in Venice.  Bibliography  *Adrian R.

Working with Lord Conwallis, governor-general of India, Law formulated a major policy known as the Permanent Settlement, which served as the basis for land tenure and taxation policy for natives during subsequent decades of British rule. He returned to England for his health in 1791, and emigrated to the United States in 1794. He settled in Washington, D.C., where he became a major investor in property and a prominent civic leader in the developing new capital. A widely read intellectual, he had grand visions for bringing Enlightenment ideas to bear in reshaping both colonial British India and the early American republic. When he left India, Law took his three illegitimate sons, borne of his Indian mistress, to England. He eventually brought his sons to the US. The eldest, George, died in 1796. John attended Harvard and Edmund attended Yale. In 1796 Law married Elizabeth Parke Custis, the eldest granddaughter of Martha Custis Washington. They had one daughter, Eliza Custis Law, who married Nicholas Rogers of Baltimore. Life Thomas Law was born on October 23, 1756 in Cambridge, England, as the youngest son of a clerical British family. He was raised in the Anglican Church as his father was Edmund Law, Bishop of Carlisle; At Google Books. his brothers were John Law, Bishop of Clonfert and Kilmacduagh in Ireland; At Google Books; Ewan Law MP; Edward Law, 1st Baron Ellenborough, Lord Chief Justice; and George Henry Law, Bishop of Bath and Wells.George Henry Law, National Portrait Gallery (London) Thomas Law went to India in the service of the East India Company in 1773, as a \\"writer\\" or clerk, the entry-level position. He rose through the Company ranks. He became a revenue collector and judge in the province of Bihar, which had a population of two million, but resigned the position as judge. As collector, in addition to fiscal duties he had responsibilities that combined a judicial and executive nature of a chief magistrate. During this period, like many of his countrymen, Law formed a long-term relationship with an Indian woman and had three sons by her. According to East India Company records, his sons George (1784-1796), John (1787?-1822), and Edmund Law (1790-1829) were baptized at St. John's Church in Calcutta.Anupama Arora and Rajender Kaur. India in the American Imaginary, 1780s‚Äì1880s, Springer, 2017, pp. 78-81 Also like many ranking EIC officials, Law made a small fortune in trading in the course of his career. Unlike many of his colleagues, however, Law was also something of an intellectual. As a policy-maker he helped devise the so-called \\"Permanent Settlement\\", which transformed the basis of taxation and land tenure for the natives of India, while attempting to establish a secure revenue base for the Company.Ranajit Guha, A Rule of Property for Bengal: An Essay On the Idea of Permanent Settlement (Durham, N.C., 1996) It was so successful that the Board adopted it across the country. When Law returned to England in 1791 because of declining health, he had ¬£50,000. (Accounts of this vary; other sources say ¬£100,000 or higher.) He had placed bonds with a bank in Calcutta to provide support of his Indian consort. He brought his three Anglo-Indian, mixed-race \\"natural\\" sons with him in order to provide them with education. Once returned, Law encountered some personal and professional setbacks, getting into disagreements with company superiors and having difficulties because of the East India Company refused to pay him money that was owed. He also fell out of favor because of his opposition to the projected war with France. =Emigration to the United States= Law decided to leave England and go to the United States. In 1794, he emigrated to the United States, taking his eldest sons, George and John, with him He left his youngest son Edmund, then four, with an aunt for a few years until he got settled and the boy was older. Law first went to New York, where he met James Greenleaf who told him of speculative and development opportunities in Washington, DC, which had been designated as the national capital in 1790. Law invested large portions of his fortune in buying land there and helping develop the new capital. There was much speculation in real estate. He invested in property with the Greenleaf Syndicate, which went bankrupt in 1797. Law continued to care for his sons and arranged for their education. Following a trip to England about 1802-1803, he returned to the United States with Edmund. John attended Harvard College [Class of 1804] and Edmund attended Yale College. =Marriage and family= Elizabeth Parke Custis, portait by Gilbert Stuart In 1796 Law married Elizabeth Parke Custis (d. 1832), the eldest granddaughter of Martha Washington and step-granddaughter of George Washington. Soon after their marriage, Law and Elizabeth moved temporarily into a new house built on 6th Street SW as part of development in that area. The Federal-style house became known as \\"Honeymoon House\\"; the Laws lived there from about March through August 1796. They next moved to the house they had built for them. Due to differences, Law and his wife separated in 1804, and they were divorced on 18 January 1811. The couple had one daughter who survived infancy, Elizabeth Law (19 January 1797 ‚Äì 9 August 1822). She married Nicholas Lloyd Rogers (known as Lloyd N. Rogers) of Druid Hill, Baltimore on 5 April 1817.Thomas Jefferson, ed. J. Jefferson Looney, The Papers of Thomas Jefferson When Law and his wife, known as Eliza P. C. Law, separated, he made a deed of certain real estate as jointure, to provide an annuity to her during her life of $1,500, for her own separate use and benefit. At her death, the said real estate was to be reconveyed to Thomas Law and his heirs, clear of encumbrances by the annuity administrators.Adams v. Law, 58 U.S. 417 (1854), Justia - US Supreme Court cases; accessed 5 February 2018 Eliza P. C. Law acquired a residence in Alexandria, Virginia, and continued to be active in Washington, DC society. Their daughter Elizabeth Law (19 January 1797 ‚Äì 9 August 1822) had three children with her husband Lloyd N. Rogers: Edmund Law (1816-1865), Eliza, and Eleanor Rogers. Elizabeth Law Rogers was survived by her husband and children, and both her parents, who at her death had been divorced for more than a decade. =Career in Washington, DC= Law built several buildings in DC, including a hotel and other properties along New Jersey Avenue, SE, and invested in others. He bought land down to Buzzard's Point, an area along the East Branch of the Potomac, and established some commercial businesses there, including a sugar mill. Because of his commercial background, he thought that area along the waterfront would rapidly develop. But early development in the city was concentrated around the White House and Capitol, the center of its political life. Over time, Law assumed a prominent role in the city's social, political, and economic life, becoming known as an energetic, if somewhat eccentric, promoter of his adopted country. He published poetry, and moral philosophy. He helped found the first theater in the nation's capital, a dancing society, and a learned society called the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences. After the War of 1812, in which Washington had suffered burning by the British, Law led an effort to retain the national capital there. He directed construction of a temporary Capitol, so Congress would have a place to meet. He continued to invest in real estate holdings in the Southwest and Southeast parts of the city. His son John Law served with United States forces in the War of 1812; he had become a lawyer. John Law also served as a local legislator. Both sons became involved in business affairs with their father. John Law also went out to the Illinois Territory to work for a period, scouting for land and development opportunities. The senior Law also worked tirelessly to gather support to build a canal through the city to facilitate trade. He publicly advocated the creation of a national paper currency to improve the country's economic development. In 1817 he bought a plantation, known as the Retreat or Tusculum, in Prince George's County, Maryland, from which he could see the East Branch of the Potomac and the city. He was elected as president of the county agricultural society. While he did use it as a retreat, he also entertained large parties, reportedly including President Monroe and top- ranking officials. Privately Law supported the abolition of slavery, as well as the colonization of free blacks outside the bounds of the United States. The American Colonization Society was active in this period in supporting relocation of free blacks to the colony of Liberia (originally separate settlements were established by state colonization societies, including one in Maryland). At the time of his death in 1834, Law had earned the support and friendship of such important national figures as presidents Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, John C. Calhoun, and Henry Clay, as well as the esteem of many ordinary citizens. Law's life and career provide a concrete link between Britain's Second Empire in India and its First Empire in North America.Allen C. Clark, Greenleaf and Law in the Federal City (Washington, D.C.: Press of W.F. Roberts, 1901), full text onlineGeorge Alfred Townsend, ‚ÄúThomas Law, Washington‚Äôs First Rich Man‚Äù, Records of the Columbia Historical Society 4 (Washington, D.C., 1901), 222-45; via JSTOR; accessed 5 February 2018 Law had invested most of his fortune in property in Washington, DC, at a time of speculation as the capital was being moved to this new city. He bought some property from the Greenleaf Syndicate, which at one time owned one-third of the saleable property, and went bankrupt in 1797. Law was repeatedly on the verge of bankruptcy. Property values fell, for instance, after the 1814 invasion and destruction by the British during the War of 1812. Estate and settlement In 1832 Thomas Law executed a will, in which he bequeathed $5,000 each to his grandsons Thomas Law and Edmund Law, the sons of the late John Law, Esq., his natural son, of Washington, DC. (Townsend said he bequeathed them $5,000 in Illinois lands to be available when they came of age.) James Adams was the executor of his will. He also bequeathed $1000 to Joseph Edmund Law, the illegitimate son of Edmund law with Mary Robinson and $1000 to Thomas Law, an illegitimate child the elder Thomas Law had later in life with his enslaved servant, Margaret Jones. By a codicil to his will, Thomas Law also bequeathed $5,000 to his legitimate grandchildren, Edmund, Eliza, and Eleanor Rogers, with a provision that the will should be null and of no effect if they should set up a claim under the marriage settlement he had made with Elizabeth P. C. Law. In late December 1832 Lloyd N. Rogers (as he was known) had gained appointment as administrator for the estate of his mother-in-law Eliza P. C. Law, who died December 31, 1831, on behalf of her grandchildren, her only survivors. He sued Thomas Law for payment of annuity and interest in arrears since 1804 on her marriage settlement. Law died in 1834. In 1838, Joseph E. Law (illegitimate son of Edmund Law), represented by his mother Mary Robinson (as \\"next friend\\" in court) filed suit to receive his $1000 bequest and pay him interest. He amended the suit seeking to have as parties Edmund and Thomas Law, and Edmund, Eliza, and Eleanor Rogers, and other heirs of Eliza P. Custis Law. The case went to the Circuit Court, which ruled that the Rogers children (grandchildren of Thomas Law) had a claim on the property he had identified as jointure in his 1804 settlement with Elizabeth P. C. Law, as did Lloyd N. Rogers for arrears of annuity and interest as administrator of Eliza P. C. Law's estate until her death. The court ordered the will to be executed and an auditor was assigned, reporting from 1848 to 1852. The trustee of the jointure and executor of the estate (Adams) appealed. The case was finally decided by the US Supreme Court in 1854 (Adams v. Law). It ruled only on the grandchildren's claim and said that the Rogers grandchildren had no \\"take\\" on the property that was subject to jointure, which Law had assigned by trust to Elizabeth P. C. Law in her lifetime via the settlement he made when they separated.Adams v. Law, 58 U.S. 417 (1854), full case, Justia - US Supreme Court By then, this property had appreciated substantially in value, making his estate one of the most valuable in DC. Only the Rogers children and Joseph E. Law survived to see their inheritance.

Inside the vehicle were three men transporting marijuana from Texas to Illinois. After Lunsford requested to search the trunk of the vehicle, the men exited the car, tackled Lunsford, beat, stabbed, and shot him after a struggle. They then drove off after killing him. Lunsford's dashboard camera in his police cruiser recorded the murder. Footage of the murder is used in law enforcement training. The date of the murder has been described as \\"one of the most infamous dates in the history of Texas law enforcement.\\" Murder On Wednesday, January 23, 1991, at approximately 1:20 a.m., Constable Darrell Lunsford spotted a suspicious vehicle, a 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with Maine license plates traveling on U.S. Highway 59 through the town of Garrison. Lunsford pulled the vehicle over and turned on his dashboard camera to record the traffic stop. He then got out of his cruiser and approached the vehicle. Inside the vehicle were three men: Baldemar Villarreal; his younger half brother, Reynaldo Villarreal; and their accomplice, Jesus Cortez Zambrano. Lunsford questioned the driver, Reynaldo, and asked whether he had any identification on him, to which Reynaldo replied no. He claimed that he had a driver's license but did not have it on him. He also said that he was helping his brother, Baldemar, drive the car. Unbeknownst to Lunsford, the three men had loaded the car with 31 pounds of marijuana, and were driving from Houston to Chicago, where they planned to sell it all. At 1:27 a.m., Lunsford asked to look in the trunk of the vehicle and the men reluctantly agreed. Lunsford and Reynaldo opened the trunk and Lunsford could immediately smell the scent of marijuana. At 1:28 a.m., Baldemar, despite being told not to, got out of the vehicle and stood with Reynaldo speaking to Lunsford. Suddenly, Baldemar grabbed Lunsford by his legs while Reynaldo grabbed him from behind, carrying out a \\"prison takedown\\" on Lunsford as they forced him down onto the ground by the side of the car. Zambrano then got out to assist his two partners in crime, and the three men proceeded to beat and kick Lunsford while he was pinned down on the ground. They rolled him over onto his stomach, kicked him in the hip three times, stabbed him repeatedly with a knife and then grabbed his own handgun. Baldemar shot Lunsford in the neck with the handgun, severing his spinal cord and killing him instantly. Moments afterwards, the suspects moved Lunsford's body into a nearby ditch. The three suspects then made a getaway in their vehicle, leaving behind Lunsford's body and his police cruiser. Victim Darrell Edward Lunsford, Sr. (October 20, 1943 ‚Äì January 23, 1991) was the Precinct 3 Constable for Nacogdoches County, Texas. Lunsford was born on October 20, 1943, in Houston. He had one brother, who died in 1956 when Lunsford was 12 years old. He married his wife, Shirley Jo Cotton, on September 29, 1962, and they had two children together. In addition to being the Precinct 3 Constable for Nacogdoches County, he also ran his own Auto Repair Shop and Parts Store in Garrison. Lunsford first joined the police force in 1983 when the people of Garrison elected him as their Constable, and continued to serve in the force until his death in 1991. He was 47 years old at the time of his death. Lunsford is survived by his wife and two children. He is buried in Cold Springs Cemetery in Garrison, Texas. Aftermath Just minutes before the murder, Sheriff's Deputy Don Welch had driven by and spotted Lunsford speaking to the men. Moments after the murder, Welch witnessed the suspects speed past him in their vehicle. Welch immediately drove back to the spot where Lunsford had been and found his dead body. Welch radioed for help, and at around 2:00 a.m., Chief Deputy Thomas Stanaland, another colleague of Lunsford, found them both. Stanaland noticed the video camera in Lunsford's cruiser. He rewound the video, watched it over and then made a copy of it. The three suspects, realizing Welch had spotted them, abandoned their vehicle less than a mile from the town of Garrison. They then fled on foot, taking the marijuana with them. Their vehicle was found later in the day. Throughout the morning, the police analyzed the videotape and were able to identify the three killers. Reynaldo Villarreal was found later in the day when a highway patrolman spotted him walking near the edge of a wooded area. He was arrested and charged with murder. Baldemar Villarreal was captured and arrested two days later and Zambrano was captured a week later. All three suspects were then tried and convicted of Lunsford's murder. The actual shooter was identified as Baldemar Sambrano Villarreal. He was sentenced to life in prison. His younger half brother, Reynaldo Sambrano Villarreal, was sentenced to 40 years in prison for his role in the murder. The third suspect, Jesus Cortez Zambrano, pleaded guilty to his role in the murder and received a 30-year prison sentence. The entire incident was captured by the dashboard camera in Lunsford's cruiser. This videotape enabled police to arrest the three killers, and is now frequently used in law enforcement training to teach officers how to handle similar situations. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Baldemar Sambrano Villarreal is due to potentially spend the remainder of his life in prison. He is incarcerated in the Federal Correctional Institution in Beaumont, Texas under registry number 03367-078. Reynaldo Sambrano Villarreal is incarcerated in the United States Penitentiary near Lewisburg, Pennsylvania under registry number 03368-078. His release date is set for January 21, 2026, meaning he will have served 35 years of his original 40-year prison sentence. Jesus Cortez Zambrano was released from prison on March 22, 2018, having served 27 years of his original 30-year prison sentence. Effects of the video Andy Lopez, Jr. was a Texas state trooper stationed in Refugio, Texas, who had watched the video of Lunsford's murder. Eight months later, around 10:08 p.m., on September 21, 1991, a Saturday night, Lopez pulled over a suspicious vehicle along U.S. Highway 77 in Refugio. Similar to the events surrounding Lunsford's murder, three Hispanic males were transporting a large amount of marijuana in the trunk of the car. While they initially allowed Lopez to inspect the trunk, one of the suspects attempted to draw a handgun. Lopez was able to react quickly to the assailant, knocking him off balance while drawing his own weapon, then firing and taking cover. The armed suspect was wounded, while the two remaining suspects fled on foot under cover of darkness. The armed suspect continued to fire on Lopez, who used strategic cover and motion while returning fire. Another trooper, then south of Lopez, responded to his call for backup. The armed suspect died from multiple gunshot wounds before help arrived. Lopez had not been severely injured, having been grazed only once. A manhunt for the other two suspects was conducted throughout the night and into the next day. When police located the two remaining suspects, who had been hiding in the woods, they were arrested without incident. The shootout between Lopez and the gunman had been videotaped by a camera in Lopez's cruiser. After the incident, Lopez told authorities that he believed the video of Lunsford's murder is what had saved his life that night. The video had helped him deal with the three suspects and he had learned not to make the same mistakes that Lunsford had made eight months earlier. For his actions, Trooper Lopez was awarded the Texas Department of Public Safety Medal of Valor, the highest award a commissioned trooper can receive.

The Black Friars' Monastery, Svartbr√∂draklostret, also called the convent of Stockholm, was a Dominican monastery on the island of Stadsholmen (City Island) in central Stockholm, founded by King Magnus IV in 1336 when he donated a plot of land located in the southern part of Stadsholmen to the Black Friars. By order of Gustav Vasa the monastery was demolished in 1547, but some of the vaults are still preserved and can be visited. Today Svartmangatan (Blackman Street), which led down to the monastery, is still reminiscent of the Black Friars' era.Friman 2008, p. 24 History =Arrival of the friars= The Black Friars or Dominicans, as they were also called, was a mendicant order founded by Saint Dominic in 1216. The name 'Black Brothers' refers to the friars style of dress, wearing black, hooded robes. In 1220, the friars came to Sweden to build convents in Sigtuna and Str√§ngn√§s. They soon sought a plot of land to construct a homeless shelter, or abbey, also in Stockholm, and found a suitable piece of land at the southern bridge between Stadsholmen and S√∂dermalm. But the king's vogt at Three Crowns Castle declared that property unlawful for them.Ohlmarks (1953), p. 358 According to another source, the friars bought a house at the southern bridge in 1289, where they lived during their trips to Stockholm. Klarissinnor och svartbr√∂der, p. 32 =Researching the Venus quarter= It was not until the year 1337 that this issue was resolved. The recently crowned King Magnus IV donated one of his crown lands, located inside the old thirteenth century city walls at today's Pr√§stgatan- √ñsterl√•nggatan, to the Black Friars. The following year he also gave a larger sum of money to the Black Friars, but the monastery could not be built until Pope Clement VI issued a permit in 1343. The reason for the delay was discord between him and the friars in Str√§ngn√§s. Toward the end of the fourteenth century the monastery had already acquired certain fame.Ohlmarks (1953), p. 359 In 1359, according to some historians, the young Swedish queen Beatrice of Bavaria and her newborn son were buried in the cloister of the monastery, Ola Kyhlberg in G√•nget ut min hand; Riddarholmskyrkans stiftargravar pp. 73 & 100 as was Queen Richardis in 1377. Lars O. Lagerqvist i Sverige och dess regenter under 1000 √•r s. 90 The monastery was completely destroyed by a severe fire that hit Stadsholmen in the year 1407, and some of the friars were even killed in the blaze. In a short period of time the monastery was rebuilt, bigger and more beautiful than before. The new monastery was Stockholm's largest and played a political role in city at that time. It was here that Charles Knutsson (the future King Charles II) was appointed Riksh√∂vitsman (Kingdom Captain) during the Engelbrekt rebellion of 1436, and Sten Sture the Elder took office as Riksf√∂rest√•ndare (Regent) in 1501.Ohlmarks (1953), p. 360 After the Siege of Tre Kronor (castle) on 9 May 1502, the defeated Queen, Christina of Saxony, was kept prisoner here by Sten Sture the Elder. Dansk biografisk Lexikon / III. Bind. Brandt - Clavus In 1929 the antiquarian and later City Curator Tord O:son Nordberg conducted a comprehensive examination and measurement of the blocks Venus and Juno. He found remains of medieval walls indicating, as he saw it, a likelihood that the monastery buildings for the most part had been in the Venus block and the church in the neighboring Juno block.Klarissinnor och svartbr√∂der, p. 33 It is assumed that the monastery basement during the late Middle Ages was leased to a wine merchant to serve as a local restaurant with direct entrance from the street, but without access to the monastery itself.Ohlmarks (1953), p. 361 =Demolition of the monastery= In 1528 Gustav Vasa had the monastery demolished, but the church and a few rows of houses remained. As first described in 1547, the building material for the monastery was used for the reconstruction of Three Crowns Castle. In Stockholm, the t√§nkebok (protocol books held at the Municipal Court in the cities during the Middle Ages and in the 1500s) of 6 June 1547 reads: (Anno Domini 1547 when the black brothers' monastery was brought to the ground and taken to the castle.) There are still two basement rooms with seven majestic brick arches at southern Benickebrinken, and four next to √ñsterl√•nggatan in Gamla stan, which originally were supposed to have been used as a shelter for wayfarers and pilgrims.

These mobsters were targets because they were less likely to approach the police and could pay the ransom. The group was a ten-man, Chicago-based group led by Theodore \\"Handsome Jack\\" Klutas.  Members  This mob-affiliated group got their name \\"College Kidnappers\\" because their leader Theodore \\"Handsome Jack\\" Klutas was an alumnus of the University of Illinois. The regular members of this group included Edward Doll aka \\"Eddie LaRue\\", Russell Hughes, Frank Souder, Gale Swoley, Ernest Rossi, Eddie Wagner, Earl McMahon, Julius \\"Babe\\" Jones, and Walter Dietrich. =\\"Handsome Jack\\" Klutas= Theodore Klutas was the son of William and Ida E. Klutas. Handsome Jack was portrayed to be large in stature and very handsome, hence the name \\"Handsome Jack\\". Klutas had connections with John Dillinger and with the Chicago crime world. He came from a respectable family who attempted to give him a college education. He attended University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign in 1923 but did not finish with a degree. He lived a short life, died at the age of 34, and is now buried next to his mother Ida E. Klutas in Whiteside county, Illinois A new case came out questioning if it was at all possible to change one's fingerprints or facial structure to try to trick the arms justice when they went to identify the subject; Handsome Jack was one of the first to try this tactic. Kidnappings and ransoms They did some bank jobs, but their main source of income was ransom payments from gamblers, bootleggers, and quite wealthy mobsters. Most of the victims snatched by The College Kidnappers were a part of the Al Capone mob. The College Kidnappers gained over half a million dollars in ransom. The troubles started for this mob group when they all started going off and freelancing. Klutas and Dietrich stole a car in 1930, and after driving for 30 miles they were spotted by police. Upon the mobsters noticing, a gunfight erupted, leaving both officers dead,Sherriff W. Sweet and Marshal Aaron Bailey and the outlaws escaped June 25, 1930. Half a year later, Dietrich joined another gang in order to rob a bank and ended up getting caught and booked to Indiana State Prison. Dietrich escaped three years later along with 10 other inmates with the help of John Dillinger. The College Kidnappers kidnapped a manufacturer but had to later release him because he was proved unable to pay the $50,000 ransom. They realized that their original targets were more dependable as far as coming up with the ransom they demanded. One mobster, James Hackett, was captured twice and the second time he was captured Hackett ended up becoming bankrupt. Hackett's first ransom was paid by his wife for a total of $75,000, and a year later The College Kidnappers demanded a second ransom for double of the first one. After him becoming bankrupt, he was put out of business, which was a big time goal of the Capone syndicates. In 1933, the Capone gangsters cornered Babe Jones, a member of The College Kidnappers, telling him to pass along the message of a payoff to stop kidnapping other Capone gangsters. Klutas indicated that he liked the deal but later ordered Jones to be killed because he was viewed as a weak individual and could possibly betray Klutas' gang. The two gunmen who were sent to kill Jones were careless. Jones knew the tactics of The College Kidnappers; he saw the two men who were waiting for his arrival, and fled the scene. In order to save his life, he went to the police and told them of several hideouts.

On November 8, the National Weather Service (NWS) began issuing severe weather warnings, saying that this was a near-record (or record) storm in the Bering Sea. It rapidly deepened from to in just 24 hours before bottoming out at 943 mbar (hPa; 27.85 inHg), roughly comparable to a Category 3 or 4 hurricane. The storm had been deemed life-threatening by many people. The storm had a forward speed of at least before it had reached Alaska. The storm began affecting Alaska in the late hours of November 8, 2011. The highest gust recorded was on Little Diomede Island. One person was reported missing after being swept into the Bering Sea, and he was later pronounced dead. Meteorological synopsis In early November 2011, an extratropical cyclone developed over the western Pacific Ocean. Gradually intensifying, the system moved rapidly northeastward at and reached the southern Aleutian Islands by November 8, with a barometric pressure estimated at 960 mbar (hPa; 28.35 inHg). Though still intensifying, winds associated with the storm were already estimated in excess of hurricane- force. By 9:00 p.m. AKST, the system had attained a pressure of around 943 mbar (hPa; 27.85 inHg) while it was near the Gulf of Anadyr. This made it one of the most powerful storms on record in the region, comparable to the November 1974 storm in Nome, Alaska, which was regarded as \\"the most severe in Nome in 113 years of record keeping.\\" According to the National Weather Service (NWS), the system was forecast to have sustained winds of over an area the size of Colorado. After weakening somewhat, the storm crossed the Chukotsk Peninsula around 9:00 a.m. AKST on November 9 before moving over the Chukchi Sea later that day. Once back over water, the extratropical cyclone turned towards the northwest and was last noted as a 975 mbar (hPa; 28.80 inHg) low on November 10, about north of Wrangel Island, before dissipating on the next day.  Preparations  On November 7 and 8, the NWS issued hurricane wind warnings, flood warnings and blizzard warnings for most of Western Alaska. The storm came after almost 7,000 people in the Kenai Peninsula lost power in a previous storm the week before. An Alaskan village called Kivalina built a wall to protect waves from flooding the village. The storm was expected to test the walls sturdiness. In case the wall fell down, people who live in Kivalina would be evacuated. Storm surges were expected to be up to 8‚Äì10 feet. The U.S. Coast Guard staged helicopters around the western coast of Alaska in case of any emergencies. People in Unalakleet, Alaska began to board up their windows on November 8. The Alaskan Homeland Security helped villages prepare for the storm.  Impact  From November 8, temperatures around Alaska began decreasing. In Anchorage, temperatures the previous day were , but temperatures began decreasing to during the afternoon. In Nome, AK, tides had risen up to , with waters moving up to bases of people's homes. Windchill temperatures south of Kivalina were with winds gusting to . Many low-lying areas experienced flooding, including Nome. Across much of western Alaska's coastline, the storm caused widespread erosion and coastal flooding from a combination of storm surge and waves estimated between . The most significant effects were felt in and around Nome where sea levels rose above normal, flooding low-lying areas. The Cape Nome Jetty sustained approximately $500,000 in damage. Although the surge did not over-top the seawall, water from breaking waves washed over and inundated a sewer and water treatment plant. The pumps at the facility were overwhelmed and 165,000 gallons of raw wastewater was discharged into a small harbor. Several other buildings in the area had basement flooding but no significant losses took place. A significant portion of the Nome-Council road was washed out or severely damaged by the storm, and damage was estimated at $24 million. Coastal damage throughout the city of Nome was estimated at $80,000. The storm caused widespread damage to approximately 37 communities on the Western Alaskan coast. Damage included coastal erosion caused by storm surge, roof and other structural damage to homes and businesses, and loss of heat and electricity. A fishing vessel was lost in the severe weather after the crew was ordered to abandon ship. The crew was rescued by the United States Coast Guard.  Aftermath  Forecasters at the NWS predicted a second strong storm; however, the forecasted storm was not expected to cause as much damage. Other low-pressure areas spawned by this storm were expected to bring heavy rain to British Columbia and the West Coast of the United States. On November 11, 2011, the National Weather Service issued hurricane-force wind warnings and storm warnings for Western Alaska with coastal flood warnings for the Alaska Peninsula. The second storm attained a minimum central pressure of on November 12, 2011. On December 22, President Barack Obama issued a disaster declaration due to the large amount of destruction caused by the storm. Other notable storms in the Bering Sea Storms analysed below by the National Weather Service occur on average 5 times per year in the Bering Sea area, where one or two per year see their central pressure drop below . 2011 also saw a low pressure reach on April 6, however this storm was less damaging as the wind-field was strongest out to sea. *November 2014: An extratropical cyclone that absorbed the remnants of Typhoon Nuri intensified to a minimum central pressure of 920 millibars (mbar), while meteorologists in the United States estimated its minimum pressure to be 924 millibars. *September 2005 and October 2004: Two powerful extratropical storms brought high storm surges to the Alaskan coast. *October 25‚Äì26, 1977: Saw what has been described as the most powerful storm in Alaska in modern times, until it was eclipsed by the November 2014 Bering Sea bomb cyclone. A minimum pressure of was recorded on the island of Unalaska, with winds in the Aleutian islands gusting at . The storm had its origins as a West Pacific Typhoon. *November 1974: A storm brought the highest storm surge to Nome above normal. *February 25, 1951: Recorded Alaska's highest sustained one-minute wind speed of at Kotzebue. *December 7, 1950: Saw the strongest wind gust ever recorded in Alaska, with a maximum gust of measured at Attu in the far west Aleutian Islands. Strong Bering Sea storms affecting Alaska typically form as East Asian-northwest Pacific storms, as cold, dry air masses from Siberia meet with mild and moist sub-tropical air masses off the coast of Japan where they can rapidly deepen above the Kuroshio Current, before heading towards Alaska. These storms develop in a similar manner to the formation of extratropical cyclones in the North Atlantic, although they tend not to reach the absolute low pressures recorded there, such as during the Braer Storm of January 1993.

The Eagle 215B has a standard empty weight of . It features a cable-braced high-wing, canard, a single-seat, open cockpit, tricycle landing gear and a single engine in pusher configuration. The aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with the flying surfaces covered in 4 oz Dacron sailcloth. Its span wing cable bracing from a single kingpost. The wing incorporates downwards pointing wing tip rudders and a trailing edge that was defined only by the sailcloth edge. This latter feature caused a number of fatal accidents due to sailcloth UV deterioration. Heavier weight sailcloth was substituted and finally a steel cable was used at the trailing edge. A fore and aft boom that acts as the wing keel also supports the canard surface. Different Eagle models used different control systems, gradually becoming more conventional over time. Assembly time from the kit is 75 hours. The Eagle was built in several models and in very large numbers. A two-seat version, the Double Eagle was produced and used by the Monterey Park, California Police Department in 1981. The accidents from the trailing edge design resulted in a number of lawsuits that eventually drove the company out of business. Variants ;Eagle 215B :First model, introduced in 1975. It has an unconventional control system, with pitch controlled by the canard surface, which is actuated by pilot weight shift fore and aft in the sling seat. A side stick deflects the wing tip rudders to create drag which causes yaw; the wing's dihedral effect then produces roll.

Territorial size is directly related to the density of hunting perches. Installing more artificial perches causes the fiscal to reduce its territory size and allow more birds in the affected range. Habitat The northern fiscal lives in a wide range of habitats from grassland with fences for perching to acacia thornveld or even woodland, but avoids very dense habitats where its hunting would be impaired.

After limited military service on the Parliamentarian side in the Third English Civil War, he represented Shropshire in the House of Commons from 1656 to 1659 during the Second and Third Protectorate Parliaments. Background and early life Thomas Mackworth was the eldest son of :*Humphrey Mackworth of Betton Strange, just south of Shrewsbury. The Mackworths' origins lay in Mackworth, near Derby,Blakeway, p. 390. and were related to the Mackworth baronets, originally of Mackworth Castle although they moved to Normanton, Rutland in the 17th century. Humphrey's junior branch of the family had held Betton Strange, a manor a few miles south of the town, since 1544Blakeway, p. 391. and were deeply involved in the politics and commerce of Shrewsbury. :*Anne Waller, Mackworth's first wife, who had married him by May 1624. She was the daughter of Thomas Waller of Beaconsfield, who seems to have been the owner of the estate known as Gregory's Manor or Butler's Court in the early 17th century.Victoria County History: Buckinghamshire: Beaconsfield parish Gregory's Manor alias Butler's Court She was related to the poet Edmund Waller, who belonged to another branch of the family in Beaconsfield. However, the Waller's originated in KentVictorian County History: Buckinghamshire: Beaconsfield parish Manors so the Parliamentarian general William Waller was a very distant kinsman. It is unlikely that Thomas Mackworth was born at Betton Strange. St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, was the parish church which covered the areaRegister of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, volume 1, p. v. and his christening is not included in its parish register. His year of birth is generally given as 1627,Blakeway, p. 393. although ODNB raises a very slight doubt by giving it as c.1628. Owen and Blakeway's 1825 History of Shrewsbury includes an abstract from an earlier manuscript listing monuments in the old churchyard: important, as the church fell down in 1788 and was replaced by a building on a new site. The monument to Thomas Mackworth and his wife apparently recorded that he was in his 70th year when he died in 1696,Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 241. tending to validate 1627 as his birth year. His brother, Humphrey Mackworth, was born in 1631Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, volume 1, p. 77. and the first of three sisters, Anne, in 1632Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, volume 1, p. 86. Their mother died in 1636 and was buried at St Chad's on 26 May. Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, volume 1, p. 109. Humphrey Mackworth subsequently married and had further children by Mary Venables, the daughter of Thomas Venables of Kinderton in Cheshire. Thomas Mackworth's childhood and youth were shaped throughout by his father's developing career and commitments. At the time of Thomas's birth, Humphrey Mackworth was a young Gray's Inn lawyer, working in London, although he moved back and began to represent the town of Shrewsbury as his family grew, attaining the rank of alderman in 1633. The family was by this time noted as Puritan: in autumn of the same year Humphrey Mackworth was one of twenty family heads who were denounced during a canonical visitation as \\"wilful refusers to communicate for the gestures sake.\\"Coulton, p. 85. because they persistently refused to bow at the name of Jesus or to kneel at the altar rail. Education Thomas Mackworth's education shadowed his father's: Shrewsbury School, the University of Cambridge and Gray's Inn. He was admitted to Shrewsbury School, then a noted centre of Calvinist and humanistic education, in 1638. He matriculated as a pensioner or fee-paying student at St Catharine's College, Cambridge at Michaelmas 1642. He was admitted at Gray's Inn, on 6 February 1645Foster, Register of Admissions to Gray's Inn, p. 239, folio 1007. and was awarded BA at Cambridge in 1646. The Civil War and Commonwealth Mackworth's further education coincided with the early and, for his family, critical phases of the English Civil War. Humphrey Mackworth was a Parliamentarian from the outset. However, Shrewsbury and most of its county fell into royalist hands and Charles I occupied Shrewsbury with his field army from 20 September 1642.Coulton, p. 91-2. At Bridgnorth on 14 October the king issued a royal proclamation threatening with prosecution for high treason Shropshire gentry who had criticised his government: Humphrey Mackworth was one of only three who were named.Coulton, p. 94. Thomas must have moved to university in safely-Parliamentarian Cambridge very soon after the family's flight and the sequestration of their home and estates by the royalists. The records of Thomas's admission to Cambridge and to Gray's Inn both describe him as the son of Humphrey Mackworth of Coventry, where Mackworth senior was employed by the city corporation as steward, so it is likely that this was the family home during these years. It was from Coventry that Parliament's reconquest of the West Midlands was launched, with a series of county committees slowly establishing themselves and federating to provide the framework for a provisional government: the Shropshire committee gained an initial foothold at Wem in the autumn of 1643.Coulton, p. 95-6. By the time Thomas Mackworth was entering Gray's Inn in February 1645, his father and the committee were already involved in plans for the taking of Shrewsbury, an aim they achieved on 21 February 1645.Coulton, p. 102-3. Humphrey Mackworth was acclaimed governor by his committee colleagues, in preference to Thomas Mytton, the successful commander who had been governor of Wem.Coulton, p. 105. Thomas seems to given his father some assistance during the years of his governorship. When Shrewsbury was fortified against the army of Charles II of Scotland in August 1651, Thomas was in charge of a detachment of soldiers in the garrison.Coulton, p. 115. He is also known to have helped during 1650-52 in the appointment of Francis Tallents as minister at Mary's church in Shrewsbury, pressing for ¬£50 in London to supplement the ¬£150 salary available in Shrewsbury.Coulton, p. 117-8. This suggests that up to this point he was still fairly closely engaged and well connected in the capital. The situation must have changed, as it had with his father, with marriage and the growth of his family. He married Anne Bulkeley, from a Shropshire gentry family, and their first son, named Bulkeley after his mother's family, was born on 14 December 1653 and baptised at Chad's church a fortnight later.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, volume 1, p. 243. From this point he was closely involved in the government of his native county. The Protectorate =Local government and justice= Thomas Mackworth's first recorded appearance as a justice of the peace in Shropshire, alongside his father, was at the quarter sessions of 10 January 1654.Wakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 9-12. The cases considered were fairly typical of the time and included local government matters as well as poor relief, the administration of justice and moral policing. It is possible his debut indicated that Humphrey Mackworth knew that he was to be nominated a member of the Protector's Council the following. Mackworth senior was heavily committed in London from that point and perhaps relied on Thomas to represent him. Thomas appeared on the bench at the next sessions, on 4 April Wakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 12-14. He was not listed as present for the sessions of 11 July. Nevertheless, the magistrates referred to him and Robert Corbet the case of a widow requesting poor relief and appointed him a commissioner of the house of correction, so he was now regarded as an active local justice of the peace. He heads the list of justices at the 3 October 1654 sessions, traditionally linked with Michaelmas but in the record for this year, apparently wrongly, with St. Martin's Day.Wakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 16-17. It was at this session that the justices decided to take a firm line over money owed for the rebuilding of Stokesay parish church, resulting in the construction of one of the very few parish churches in the country dating from the Commonwealth or Protectorate periods. Mackworth missed the Epiphany sessions of 1655,Wakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 18. which were held soon after his father's funeral in Westminster Abbey. Humphrey Mackworth senior's death must have been unexpected and he died intestate, probably preoccupying Thomas Mackworth, the heir, in administrative complications and family difficulties. However, for the remaining three quarter sessions of the year both Thomas and his younger brother Humphrey appeared on the bench. Both seem to have remained active even when unable to attend. For example, Thomas was not on the bench at Easter 1657 but those present acted on an order he had issued under the Poor Law.Wakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 42-3. =Member of Parliament= In 1656, Mackworth was elected Member of Parliament for Shropshire for the Second Protectorate Parliament.Notitia Parliamentaria, p. 277. at Internet Archive. This was elected under the Instrument of Government, like the First Protectorate Parliament of 1654-5, and was similarly intended to legitimise the rule of Oliver Cromwell. The election results were more favourable to the government on the second attempt, as senior military figures worked hard to vet candidates and to encourage sympathetic electors.Roots, p. 217-8. As before, this was a unicameral legislature in which all representatives had to meet a ¬£200 property qualification, and the seats were redistributed according to a system that removed some of the small borough seats and gave four, instead of two, to the counties.Roots, p. 201-2. Thomas's brother, Humphrey, now addressed as Colonel, represented Shrewsbury in the same parliament and it is not always easy to distinguish them in the parliamentary record. Neither was very prominent. However, it was Mr Mackworth who was appointed to an important committee on an Act for the Security of the Protector's Person on 26 September.House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 26 September 1656 It may have been his experience of intestacy, as well as his legal training, that obtained him a place on a committee to discuss an Act for the Probate of Wills a month later.House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 27 October 1656 In November he was deputed to help consider the case of John Cole,House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 22 November 1656 a case concerning contract and debt that had simmered since 1640 and was to consume a considerable amount of parliamentary time in future. Not until June 1658 did he appear again in the record, as one appointed to a committee on a bill concerning recusants.House of Commons Journal Volume 7:1 June 1657 He seems to have become gradually more involved in the parliamentary process, acting as teller in a number of divisions of the House. One of these was in relation to a Bill for Preventing Multiplicity of Buildings, which was intended to tackle a serious shortage of housing by preventing wealthy householders annexing neighbouring properties to their own.House of Commons Journal Volume 7:20 June 1657 He was re-elected MP for Shropshire in 1659 for the Third Protectorate Parliament,Notitia Parliamentaria, p. 291. at Internet Archive. once again accompanying his brother to Westminster. This went back to the old, unreformed distribution of seats and had a small upper chamber. Richard Cromwell delivered its opening address on 27 January.Roots, p. 258-9 The following day a Mr Mackworth, probably Thomas, was appointed to its important Privileges committee.House of Commons Journal Volume 7:28 January 1659 However, the parliament was short- lived and Thomas Mackworth played little further part in its proceedings before Cromwell dissolved the parliament on 22 April, fearing that Charles Fleetwood, was about to launch a coup.Roots, p. 262-3 Restoration By now the Protectorate regime was itself dissolving. Mackworth's last recorded appearance at the Shropshire quarter sessions before the restoration of the monarchy was on 12 July 1659.Wakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 65. Thomas Mackworth's identification with the Cromwellian regime had not been as complete as his brother Humphrey's. While Humphrey disappeared as Charles II appeared, Thomas seems to have been largely content to settle into private life. By 1668 he was sufficiently rehabilitated to be selected as Sheriff of the county for the following year. However, it took the Glorious Revolution to bring him back to the bench. He appeared at the quarter sessions of July 1689Lloyd Kenyon (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 121. Thereafter he was a regular and active member of the bench until October 1696,Lloyd Kenyon (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 164. a month before his death. Marriage and family Mackworth twice and had issue by both wives. Anne Bulkeley, daughter of Richard Bulkeley of Buntingsdale, Shropshire, was Mackworth's first wife. The children of this marriage included: :*Bulkeley Mackworth (1653-1731), an important Shropshire landowner. :*Anne Mackworth (born 1656), who married Edward Minshull of Stoke, Cheshire. :*Sir Humphrey Mackworth (1657-1727), industrialist in Wales, Tory MP, fraudster and constitutional writer. Anne died in 1666 and was buried at St Chad's on 27 April.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, volume 1, p. 330. Sarah Mytton, daughter of General Thomas Mytton was Mackworth's second wife. They married at St Chad's on 29 September 1674.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, volume 1, p. 415. This marriage produced a daughter: :*Dorothy (born 1677), who married William Taylor of Rodington, Shropshire. Sarah Mackworth outlived her husband, died on 28 August 1698 and was buried at St Chad's on 3 September.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, volume 2, p. 811. Death Thomas Mackworth died on 12 November 1696 and was buried at St Chad's on 19 November.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, volume 2, p. 804.

He was the Parliamentarian military governor of Shrewsbury in the later phases of the war and under The Protectorate. He occupied several important legal and judicial posts in Chester and North Wales, presiding over the major trials that followed the Charles Stuart's invasion in 1651. In the last year of his life, he attained national prominence as a member of Oliver Cromwell's Council and as a Member of the House of Commons for Shropshire in the First Protectorate Parliament. Origins and background alt=ruined building in reddish sandstone Humphrey Mackworth was born on 27 January 1603. He was the eldest child and only son of *Richard Mackworth of Betton Strange, Shropshire. The Mackworths were a minor gentry family, settled just to the south of Shrewsbury, but with other property in the county. Their name comes from Mackworth, a village in Derbyshire, where Mackworth Castle was at that time home to the Mackworth baronets, although they later relocated to Rutland. Richard's great-great-grandfather, Thomas Mackworth, founded the Shropshire branch of the family, acquiring Meole Brace, just south of Shrewsbury, through marriage to a cousin of Lord Zouche.Blakeway, p. 390. One of his younger sons, John Mackworth, made his way up through the commerce and politics of Shrewsbury, buying Betton in 1544.Blakeway, p. 391. *Dorothy Cranage, daughter of Lawrence Cranage of Keele, near Newcastle-under-Lyme, in the neighbouring county of Staffordshire. Humphrey Mackworth had two younger sisters: Margaret, who married William Juckes, and Agnes, who married William Crowne, proprietor of Nova Scotia. Richard Mackworth was buried at St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury on 22 May 1617Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 3. and his wife Dorothy secured control of his estates. She then married Adam Ottley of London, son of Richard Ottley of Pitchford Hall, Shropshire, by whom she had another son,Foljambe, p. 364. and, after his death, she married John Gorton.Blakeway, p. 392.Phillips (ed.), 1895, Ottley Papers, p. 303, note 1.

Woodcut, artist unknown. All three of the educational institutions attended by Mackworth were noted as centres of Calvinist learning. He studied at Shrewsbury School from January 1614. The school had been founded in the reign of Elizabeth I, providing a distinctly Protestant and humanist education, and numbering among its alumni Philip Sidney,Coulton, p. 53. as well as sons of the Protestant gentry, like Robert Corbet (died 1583). Mackworth matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge at Easter 1619 as a Fellow Commoner, a privileged position requiring considerable wealth. At the time the college was popular among some Shropshire gentry circles because of the presence of the puritan preacher John Preston,Coulton, p. 78-9. who was active throughout Mackworth's period of study, leaving to become Master of Emmanuel College in 1622. Mackworth was admitted for legal training at Gray's Inn on 24 October 1621Foster, Register of Admissions to Gray's Inn, p. 164, folio 785. and was called to the bar about a decade later. Throughout his period of study the preacher at Gray's Inn was Richard Sibbes, a close associate of Preston. Both promoted a fairly open and inclusive interpretation of Calvinism, which was nevertheless at odds with royal tastes. However, the Inn proved fertile ground and the chapel had to be enlarged to accommodate the audience for Sibbes's sermons in 1624.Coulton, p. 81. Mackworth was to achieve eminence in his profession but was clearly not an academic lawyer or jurisprudent and only figures twice in the Pension Book, the records of the presiding council of his Inn of Court: in both cases, he was promoted to a new level of seniority, but only after achieving great offices in the worlds of law and politics. On 24 November 1645 he was called to be an Ancient, a member of the Grand Company of the Inn.Fletcher (ed), Pension Book of Gray's Inn, p. 354. On 10 February 1650 the Pension \\"ordered that Mr. Humphrey Mackworth deputy Cheife Justice of Chester and Vice-Chamberlayne of Chester bee called to the Bench and read in his course before Mr. Fell.\\"Fletcher (ed), Pension Book of Gray's Inn, p. 380. Legal practice and prelude to civil war Mackworth came into his estates, aged 21, in 1624. He married for the first time, around the same time, to Anne Waller: a son was baptised on 10 September 1629.Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 67. His family lived at Betton Strange while he practised as a lawyer, dividing his time between Shropshire and London. From 1626 to 1631 he collected reports on cases in the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of King's Bench. In the 1630s he was a lawyer for the town of Shrewsbury itself. In 1633 he was made an alderman of the town, although the position was unconfirmed as the town was awaiting confirmation of its royal charter. During this period of absolute monarchy, known as Thorough, most of the normal political channels for debate and contest were unavailable and both conformity and dissent were vented through ecclesiastical politics. Betton Strange was in the parish of St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury,Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. v. then the largest of the town's parishes.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 209. There had been a tradition of learned and radically Protestant preaching at St Chad's for some decades.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 212-4. However, Peter Studley, the incumbent (then termed curate) appointed in 1622,Coulton, p. 80. Cf. Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 214. and editor's introduction to Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. xviii., which both give 1628, although Studley's own statement of his term of service makes this very unlikely. although a local man was of the High Church and Arminian persuasion then becoming increasingly influential at Court. Conflict between himself and the congregation escalated as he steadily imposed his views and practices. An episcopal visitation in 1626 found that some parishioners, particularly in St Julian's parish, which Studley also served, objected to his failure to preach and pointed out that, under the Act of Uniformity 1558, they had to attend his services and were not able to hear the preaching provided in neighbouring churches at the same time. Some had begun to gather on Sunday evenings in private houses to hear sermons read: Studley questioned whether these assemblies counted as conventicles.Coulton, p. 82. Seven women, including Katherine Chidley, refused to undergo the churching of women: she was later to write polemics in support of Independency and her son Samuel was to become a leading Leveller. However Mackworth's puritan leanings only slowly brought him notoriety. It was during an autumn 1633 visitation by Robert Wright, the Bishop of Lichfield and a close associate of William Laud, that Studley denounced Mackworth among the heads of twenty families. They refused to bow at the name of Jesus or to kneel at the altar rail ‚Äì a refusal which meant they were \\"wilful refusers to communicate for the gestures sake.\\"Coulton, p. 85. Studley went on to write a bitter polemic against puritanism: The Looking- Glasse of Schisme, published in London in 1634.Coulton, p. 86. This focussed on the sensational murder by a young farmer, Enoch ap-Evans of Clun, of his own mother and brother, which Studley claimed was a symptom of his known puritan beliefs.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 214-5. He pointedly referred to what must have been a solid and growing opposition in his own parish, and at the same time conflated puritanism with opposition to monarchy: :Know, good reader, that this towne of Shrewsbury, the place of my birth and residence is greatly troubled with a sect of men and women, with whom I have had much intercourse of concernment, not by way of intimate familiarity approving their ways, but of vexation and trouble of minde, that I could not, in thirteene yeares painfull ministry among them, reclaime them from their wandring fancies, and reduce them to obedience to Supreme majestie, in the persons of two most illustrious and royal kings.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 215, note 1. alt=Portrait of William Laud in clerical garb. Richard More, a puritan member of the congregation refuted Studley's allegations in A true relation of the Murders committed in the Parish of Clunne, but could not obtain a licence to publish it until 1641. In the following year Laud initiated a visitation of all the dioceses in the Province of Canterbury, which was overseen in Staffordshire and Shropshire by Nathaniel Brent.Coulton, p. 87-8. This led to a widespread imposition of \\"Catholic\\" features, including altars and images. St Chad's was decorated with religious pictures, illustrating Biblical narratives. Studley, in his moment of triumph, was presented with the opportunity to leave the scene by appointment to a living at Pontesbury. Mackworth was closely involved in the issue of his replacement, as the right of appointment was claimed by the town. The bailiffs duly appointed Richard Poole on 29 March 1637.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 215. Close enquiry proved this to be unfounded. There was an old tradition, long since discounted, that St Chad's was a royal chapel,Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 186-9. giving the Crown an opportunity to claim it as a royal peculiar. Laud challenged the appointment by a successful quo warranto action, and the living was taken back into royal hands. The issue was then subsumed into the town's renegotiation of its charter, in which Mackworth acted for the corporation. In 1638, a compromise engineered by Sir Richard Newport finally renewed the charter and left Poole in place, expanding the council and giving both the \\"religious party\\" of Mackworth and their opponents representation. Mackworth's position as an alderman of Shrewsbury was confirmed. In July of that year he married Mary Venables, his first wife having died in 1636. Charles I was compelled to call the Short Parliament in 1640, allowing protest to resume political channels. However, Convocation continued in session after the parliament was prorogued, approving a series of canons that included the notorious Etcetera oath, approving a church polity under \\"archbishops, bishops, deans, and archdeacons &.\\"Coulton, p. 89. Mackworth was prominent in organising a protest by Shropshire clergy against the oath. This was part of a wider movement that produced the Root and Branch petition against episcopacy, debated by the Long Parliament. The Civil War =Royalist conquest of Shropshire= alt=Print of a rather generic Cavalier, with long moustache and pointed beard. William Pierrepont of alt=Half-length portrait in a cartouche of slightly rotund man, with slight moustache, in deep red velvet robe with white collar. As the crisis in relations between King and Parliament escalated towards war, during the summer of 1642, both sides took steps to mobilise forces. Parliament deputed Sir John Corbet, 1st Baronet, of Stoke upon Tern, Richard More and William Pierrepont to take charge in ShropshireHouse of Commons Journal Volume 2: 22 July 1642 but they were forestalled by a more rapid royalist response, initiated primarily by Francis Ottley of Pitchford Hall,Coulton, p. 91. At his instigation, the king led the main royalist field army from its initial rallying point at Nottingham to Shrewsbury, which it occupied on 20 September 1642.Sherwood, p. 4-5. He knighted Ottley and gave him control of the town, although formal appointment as governor did not come until late January 1643. Ottley was, by the standards of the time, a cousin of Mackworth, as his uncle had married Mackworth's widowed mother: moreover, Ottley's paternal grandmother was Catherine Mackworth of Betton Strange, so they were also second cousins. Despite this and other close relationships with royalist families, Mackworth sided with Parliament from the outset: his name appears, second only to Thomas Mytton, on a list of \\"the names of the delinquents within the towne and liberties of Shrewsbury\\", apparently prepared for Ottley in the early days of the royalist military occupation.Phillips (ed.), 1895, Ottley Papers, p. 251. The royalist army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, heading for London on a campaign that would culminate in the inconclusive Battle of Edgehill.Sherwood, p. 13. Its first halt was at Bridgnorth, where the king issued a proclamation \\"for the better peace of our County of Salop,\\" ordering the arrest of \\"some persons of good quality,\\" accused of spreading sedition and libel, whom Charles intended to put on trial for high treason. Only three of these were named: Thomas Nichols, Humphrey Mackworth and Thomas Hunt.Phillips (ed.), 1895, Ottley Papers, p. 252. All three were among those suspended by Shrewsbury Corporation, acting on a letter from the king, from attending further meetings unless and until they could clear their names. Mackworth's lands were sequestered by the royalists, apparently under Ottley's control, to provide funds for their own war effort. Evidently the sequestration was very thorough, but not thought through. The royalist William Browne had acquired an interest in Mackworth's estates through an indenture of mortgage, in return for a loan of ¬£300 to Mackworth. Sequestration deprived him of a substantial income. Early in 1643 Ottley was compelled to issue an order allowing Browne to draw ¬£70 a year from Mackworth's estates.Phillips (ed.), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.298-9. On 31 March Mackworth's mother, Dorothy Gorton, the widow of Ottley's uncle, wrote to Ottley from Sutton Coldfield seeking to recover the rents of part of the sequestered Mackworth estates that she claimed as jointure property. She asked that he \\"not let me suffer for my sonns esteemed fault.\\"Phillips (ed), 1895, Ottley Papers, p.302-3. =Parliamentarian recovery= By this time Mackworth's \\"esteemed fault\\" had gone well beyond speaking out of turn. He was appointed to a series of committees and associations, covering Shropshire and neighbouring counties, as Parliament sought to establish a provisional government of the areas captured by the royalists, pending their recapture. On 2 February 1643 the House of Commons of England appointed him to the associated committees covering not Shropshire but Staffordshire and Warwickshire,House of Commons Journal Volume 2: 2 February 1643 New Style which included Coventry, where Mackworth held a stewardship. On 24 February, however, it was to a Shropshire committee set up to raise ¬£375 per week for the war effortActs and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642‚Äì1660: February 1643: An Ordinance for the speedy raising and levying of Money. ‚Äì a vast sum that was clearly out of the question at this stage, with the county almost entirely in royalist hands. On 27 March he was made a member of the Shropshire parliamentarian sequestration committee.Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642‚Äì1660: March 1643: An Ordinance for sequestring notorious Delinquents Estates. 10 April brought formal recognition of a general parliamentary committee for Shropshire, albeit as part of an Act ordering it to federate with Warwickshire and StaffordshireActs and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642‚Äì1660: April 1643: An Ordinance for raising Forces for the defence of the County of Warwick, etc.. This act listed the committee members explicitly: the original trio of Corbet, More and Pierrepont were joined by Mackworth, Mytton, Nichols, Andrew Lloyd, Robert Corbet of Stanwardine and other parliamentarian gentry. Sir William Brereton, Parliament's commander in Cheshire and a valuable ally of the Shropshire committee. Arthur Capel, 1st Baron Capel, who commanded the royalist armies in the region. Progress in actually fighting the Shropshire royalists was initially slow ‚Äì not least because the regional parliamentarian commander, Basil Feilding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh was the object of accusations of disloyalty which he shook off only with difficulty. However, with the help of Sir William Brereton of Cheshire the Shropshire committee seized a foothold in the county at the unfortified market town of Wem, around the end of August 1643.Sherwood, p. 64. Some of the committee took up residence there, taking with them as temporary chaplain the puritan minister Richard Baxter, who was recruited by Mackworth and Thomas Hunt at Coventry: although Mytton was the military governor at Wem, Baxter referred to the parliamentarian garrison as \\"Colonel Mackworth's troop.\\"Coulton, p. 97. In October the small garrison, with trenches still only partly dug, drove off a full-scale royalist attack, under Lord Capel. An uprising of the townspeople, including women armed with pans, was credited with turning the tide and a popular rhyme declared: :The women of Wem, and a few musketeers, :Beat the Lord Capel, and all his Cavaliers. Mackworth was present during the royalist assault and seems to have taken part in the fighting.Phillips, Memoirs of the Civil War in Wales and the Marches, p. 123. Etching by Wenceslaus Hollar of Laud's trial, which forced Mackworth to go to London in 1644. The Wem outpost remained under constant threat and only some of the committee risked their own lives by remaining there. Sir John Corbet was mostly in London. Mackworth seems to have been active in the area, as a commissioned captain in the parliamentary army, but was sometimes in Coventry or in London. In December Mackworth, Mytton and others sent a letter from the committee at Wem to the Commons,House of Commons Journal Volume 3: 2 December 1643 suggesting that both were present at what was a dangerous time. A damaged letter from the same month, preserved in the state papers and complaining about depredations of the Parliamentarians around Hodnet, name Mackworth, Mytton, Lloyd and Thomas Hunt as \\"the chief men with us of the Committee.\\"Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1641‚Äì1643, 7 December 1643, p. 503. Later in the month Mackworth went to London, where he was due to make depositions against Laud before a House of Lords committee in January 1644. These particularly related to Laud's interference with the town's charter, in a dispute between the town and William Beale, Master of St. John's College, Cambridge, and in the appointment of the head of Shrewsbury School.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1644, 10 January 1644, p. 2. Meanwhile, the situation in Shropshire became desperate as numerous experienced royalist soldiers, redeployed during a lull in the Irish Confederate Wars, entered the country via Chester.Phillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.214-5. Robert Corbet and Andrew Lloyd, committee members who remained at Wem, wrote to Mackworth, asking him to \\"represent our forlorne condition to the Parliament, for whom we have desperately engaged our estates and lives.\\"Coulton, p.98 Mytton counter-attacked against the royalists: on 12 January he captured a large royalist ammunition convoy at Ellesmere, Shropshire, along with its commanders.Phillips, Memoirs of the Civil War in Wales and the Marches, p. 123-4. On 18 February Prince Rupert arrived in Shrewsbury, shook up the garrisonPhillips (ed), 1896, Ottley Papers, p.224-5. and then launched a brutal campaign, defeating a force under Mytton at Market DraytonSherwood, p. 89. He left on 14 March to relieve Newark. On 27 March Mackworth wrote to Denbigh from Coventry, bemoaning the \\"bleedinge condition\\" of Shropshire:Sherwood, p. 91. unless relief came soon, he averred, he would have to recommend withdrawal to Nantwich or Stafford. =Rise to power= Wenceslas Hollar's portrait of Basil Fielding, 2nd Earl of Denbigh, Parliament's commander in the Midlands, who considered himself socially superior to the gentry county committee men. Despite a further campaign by Rupert, the garrison at Wem clung on. However divisions began to emerge between the military and the civilians, setting Mytton against the rest of the county committee, which seems to have resented his being in London during this further onslaught: he returned on 24 MayCoulton, p. 100. ‚Äì just after Rupert moved away to the relief of York and a shattering defeat at the Battle of Marston Moor. The divisions seem to have worsened even as Mytton and his forces helped win important successes ‚Äì not least at Oswestry, which he helped Denbigh to take in JuneSherwood, p. 106-7. and where he also became governor. Even in the aftermath of the victory at Oswestry, the committee wrote in July that \\"For twelve months they have been fed only with fair promises\\" ‚Äì a direct attack on Denbigh's management of the campaign. Tempers flared and Denbigh directly confronted Mackworth at the Coventry committee, which had also written a letter critical of him to the House of Commons. Mackworth had accused Denbigh of panic in the face of a charge by a much weaker enemy force. Denbigh threatened to run him through with his sword or have him cudgelled to death.Johnstone, p. 269-70. He asserted that he would never again come to Shropshire until Mackworth and other hostile members were removed from the committee. Mackworth was subject to implicit criticism from Parliament: on 11 September the Committee of Both Kingdoms resolved to tell him that he should prioritise his work in Shropshire over his responsibilities at CoventryCalendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1644, 10 January 1644, p. 493. and on 17th despatched a letter to this effect via Pierrepont.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1644, 10 January 1644, p. 514. However complaints from many quarters against Denbigh were mounting and the issues were referred to Parliament. Although the House of Lords cleared him on 8 November, the Commons came to a split decision on 20 November. It found that he had violated an agreement made with the Coventry Committee and \\"The Question being put, Whether this House doth concur with the Lords, in sending down the Earl of Denbigh to his Command in his Association: It passed with the Negative.\\"House of Commons Journal Volume 3: 20 November 1644 However, Denbigh was allowed to serve on a parliamentary delegation for peace talks with the royalists. The issues between Mackworth and Denbigh were to be rehearsed again in 1649Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1649‚Äì1650, 19 December 1649, p. 444-7. as Parliament moved to put the king on trial. Denbigh's arrogance toward several of the West Midlands committees was recounted in detail and his threats to have Mackworth murdered said to have been made to William Crowne, Mackworth's brother-in-law. Mackworth had by then amassed a considerable amount of evidence that Denbigh and his associates had considered the creation of a \\"third party\\" during 1643‚Äì4 and this seems to have helped discredit his opposition to the trial and execution of the king. alt=Sketch map of infantry, cavalry and shock force attacks on Sahrewsbury, 21 February 1645 Mytton was apparently seen by the committee as sharing Denbigh's brusqueness and arrogance. In January 1645 committee members Robert Clive, Andrew Lloyd, Thomas Hunt and Robert Charlton wrote to William Brereton to solicit help for their plan to retake Shrewsbury. They said that Mytton \\"carries himself crossly towards us on all matters,\\" and proposed not to inform him of the plan, but to pretend they were making an attempt on the nearby village of AtchamCoulton, p. 102. ‚Äì a plausible target, as it commanded important bridges where Watling Street crossed the River Severn and River Tern. In the event, Mytton was in charge of one of the cavalry units that occupied the town on 21 February. However, the crucial first entry to the town was made by a tiny shock force under William Reinking, a Dutch professional soldier employed by the Wem committee, which was admitted into the town by a sympathiser.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 449-53. Mytton seems to have expected the governorship of the town.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 459. However, on 27 February, immediately after news of the town's capture arrived in London, the Commons voted ¬£4000 for Shrewsbury's defence and resolved: :That it be referred to the Committee at Shrewesbury, or the major Part of them, to nominate a Governor for the Town of Shrewesbury; and to present it to the House: And that, in the mean time, the Committee take care of the Preservation of the Town.House of Commons Journal Volume 4: 27 February 1645 On 26 March the committee replied that \\"Wee have upon serious consideration made choyce of Colonell Humfrey Mackworth.\\"Coulton, p. 105. Mytton pointedly was the only committee member not to endorse the decision. On 19 March it was rumoured that Mytton had been appointed governor and ten days later he was received at the bar of the House of Commons and warmly thanked for his efforts.House of Commons Journal Volume 4: 29 March 1645 However, when the committee formed an infantry force of 150 on 2 April it was significantly named \\"Humphrey Mackworth his regiment.\\"Johnstone, p. 270. Mytton accepted the command of parliamentarian forces in North Wales, temporarily leaving the scene. Mackwood's appointment was not immediately confirmed by Parliament and initially he had no official rank beyond committee member. On 2 JuneThus Coulton, p.105. Owen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 459. gives 2 June. he was reinstated to the town's council, along with the other suspended members. He was appointed Recorder of the town in November, a judicial post in the gift of the council that went some way to recognising his power. Only much later, on 2 June 1646, did the Commons formally appoint Mackworth governor,House of Commons Journal Volume 4: 2 June 1646 with the House of Lords agreeing three days later.House of Commons Journal Volume 4: 5 June 1646 He had been present with John Birch at the siege of Ludlow, the last royalist garrison in Shropshire, and the appointment was a direct response to their report of the town's fall. On 6 June the Derby House Committee agreed to grant Mackworth a commission to be governor of the castle and garrison,Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1645‚Äì1647, 6 June 1646, p. 441. simultaneously appointing Samuel More governor at Ludlow. Thereafter Mackworth was appointed to every parliamentary committee in Shropshire, strengthening his influence across the county. =Puritan revolution= The conquest of power by Mackworth and the committee allowed them to carry out a thorough purge, reversing the expulsions of puritan clergy of the late 1630s and of 1642. The incumbents at Holy Cross (the parish church on the site of Shrewsbury Abbey, St Mary's and St Chad's, and the head of Shrewsbury school, were all expelled and replaced by reliable puritans.Auden (1907), p. 262. Julines Herring, who had previously been public preacher in the town, was invited to return from his exile in Amsterdam but was already dying. The purge was extended into the rural areas, with Studley being expelled from his living at Pontesbury. St Chad's elected its own minister:Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 216. Thomas Paget, a committed Presbyterian who had submitted a book defending this form of church government to Parliament in 1641.Coulton, p. 106. He probably played a leading role in drawing up plans for the Presbyterian organisation of the Church of England in Shropshire and Mackworth must have at least approved them, as he was by far the strongest voice in the government of the county, as well as a leading member of Paget's congregation. In June 1646, in fulfilment of the Solemn League and Covenant that had secured its alliance with the Scottish Covenanters, Parliament required each county to plan and secure approval for a Presbyterian polity. Only eight counties both drew up a plan and tried to implement it, Shropshire being one of them.Coulton, p. 107. The structure is summarised in a document dated 29 April 1647 and entitled: The Severall Divisions and Person for Classicall Presbyteries in the County of Salop.Auden (1907), p. 263. Shrewsbury formed the centre of its first classis and Mackworth was named as one of its ruling elders.Auden (1907), p. 264. As the title \\"Saint\\" was now restricted to the Apostles, St Chad's was now referred to as Chad's (although rendered Cedds), and St Mary's and St Alkmund's also lost their titles: village churches were referred to simply by the name of the parish, not the dedication. Other committee members were distributed as elders throughout the other classes, with Robert Corbet and Andrew Lloyd, as well as Thomas Mytton in the second. It seems that much of the structure was a dead letter and that only the fourth classis, based on Wem and Whitchurch functioned fully. A substantial proportion of the classis ministers signed a protest against toleration of Independency or Congregationalism in 1648. However, the Scottish Covenanters' invasion of England in an attempt to restore the king discredited Presbyterianism in the eyes of the New Model Army which began to gain the upper hand politically, favouring Independency and the execution of the king. Mackworth increasingly supported this radical tendency. Owen and Blakeway assumed he had always been an Independent,Owen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 462. but the Presbyterian blueprint for the county, revealed in Auden's much later sketch for an ecclesiastical history of the county, suggests an evolution. Defending Shrewsbury From 1647 Mackworth's power was consolidated in Shropshire and expanded in Wales and the Welsh marches to become regional in scope. His governorship was recognised again by Parliament on 24 March 1647, specifying Shrewsbury Castle as its seat.House of Commons Journal Volume 5: 24 March 1647 The difficulties of governing were similar to those experienced not only by other parliamentarian governors, like Colonel Hutchinson at NottinghamJohnstone, p. 271. but also by Ottley and the other royalist governors of Shrewsbury. Financial pressures were enormous and continuous. In June Mackworth was nominated by the Commons as one of the commissioners to raise the vast and strangely precise sum of ¬£5531 19s. 9¬æd. monthly from Shropshire to finance Fairfax's army and military operations in Ireland.June 1647: An Ordinance for raising of Moneyes to be imployed towards the maintenance of Forces within this Kingdome... There were the problems of dealing with the royalist gentry who had been defeated, as well as with continued royalist activity. There were also significant divisions in the parliamentarian ranks. All of these problems had to confronted while retaining a fair measure of support from the population of the town and the county. =A posture of defence= Mackworth began to tighten up security in the summer of 1647. The impetus came not from royalist threats but from the uncertainty caused by the abduction of the king from parliamentary custody at Holdenby House by George Joyce on 3 June. The uncertainty caused Mackworth to write urgently to members of the county committee on 5 June: :Gentlemen, :I heare, how true I know not, that the King, with the commissioners at Holmby, are fetcht away by a 1000 horse to the army. What thinges may come to, God onely knowes. Wherfore, I propose to you whether it may stand with your likeinge, 1st, That I speedily put this towne into a posture, and have a maine guard in the towne at least every night, if not some in the day: which, if you assent, I shall doe speedily. 2. That all the troope bee sent to Ludlow forthwith, to convey the ordinaunce and magazin away with as much speede as may bee hither : and some of the troope to lodge constantly in the Castle here, at least till all artillery and magazin bee brought away. 3. That all the armes in all places of the county bee speedily seised, and brought hither and kept, to bee delivered to the owners when the danger cease; and that none in the county be permitted to sell armes or powder without an order from the Committee. 4. That all the delinquents that have not compounded bee presently seized. To these, or what else you thinke needfull, I desire your subscriptions and this letter returned. What you advise I shall see immediately executed...Owen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 463. However, there were already rumours that the ruling group moved more slowly than the situation demanded because they secretly favoured the army. The discontinuation of the plans for classical presbyteries during the year suggests the same: the functioning fourth classis was dominated by Sir John Corbet,Auden (1907), p. 267. who was part of the moderate Presbyterian group in Parliament. A row within parliamentarian ranks in January 1648 brought Mackworth's true feelings to the surface.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1648‚Äì1649, January 1648, p. 11. An ensign called Hill had made an accusation of disloyalty against Mackworth's second- in-command, John Downs. Although Mackworth investigated and dismissed the matter, Hill went further and got a commission from Fairfax to restart the investigation. Mackworth sent the commission back to Fairfax, making clear that Downs was a trusted aide whom he had used to \\"beget a right understanding amongst my officers and soldiers concerning your excellency's and the army's proceedings.\\" As they were mainly preoccupied with internal politics, the Shrewsbury parliamentarians seem to have done little to reinforce the defences until well into 1648, when a credible royalist threat emerged. alt=Head and shoulders colour portrait of haughty Cavalier, wearing yellow, with breastplate, lace collar and elaborate black cockade. Gatehouse to Madeley Court, one of the probable targets of the June rebellion. Shropshire became involved in the Second English Civil War largely because, in February 1648, John Byron, 1st Baron Byron, the former royalist regional commander and governor of Chester, was sent from Paris to foment royalist uprisings.Auden (1910), p. 90. This resulted in royalist plot to seize Shrewsbury, which Mackworth detected and frustrated in April: those arrested were imprisoned in Ludlow Castle. Attempts to start a general uprising in Wales in May were confused and easily suppressed.Auden (1910), p. 91. However, a wide-ranging plot involving royalist gentry in Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire that was uncovered and suppressed in early June caused consternation.Auden (1910), p. 94-5. About 200 royalists were surprised at Boscobel and their leaders, including Dud Dudley arrested. The plan had involved seizing a house known as Dawley Castle and the nearby house of Sir Basil Brooke, presumably Madeley Court. It was the Worcester committee that took credit by reporting this to the Commons on 11 July and the Shropshire parliamentarians were instructed to demolish Dawley Castle.House of Commons Journal Volume 5: 11 July 1648 An attempt to seize Chester Castle on 16 June came to nothing. The Shropshire committee had formed a safety committee and this at last acted on Mackworth's urgings of the previous year, ordering on 25 June that \\"the towne of Shrewsbury bee forthwith put into a posture of defence,\\" that additional forces be raised and the walls speedily repaired. However, Robert Clive, an opinionated member of the committee, wrote in July to Speaker Lenthall complaining about the lack of action.Auden (1910), p. 98. The Derby House Committee wrote to the Shropshire committee on 17 July that it should \\"keep a careful eye on that Castle, that it not be surprised by Malignants.\\"Auden (1910), p. 99. slighted to prevent its reuse.alt=Grey stone ruins, with tall upstanding remains of tower, on a grassy hill, pictured against blue sky. On 2 August there was a further attempted uprising in Shropshire, allegedly led by Byron himself. Mackworth learnt through an informer that several troops of royalist cavalry would meet at various locations across the north of the county, close to the Welsh border, including Wattlesborough, before proceeding to a general rendezvous at Prees Heath. The aim was to storm Shrewsbury itself: no infantry or artillery are mentioned, so the scheme must have involved a desperate dash, hoping to catch the garrison completely unprepared. Mackworth used the advantages of good intelligence and short, secure supply lines to the full, quietly concentrating forces at Wem. They moved towards Prees Heath under cover of darkness and surprised several parties of royalists before the full assembly could take place, causing the rest to disperse in panic.Auden (1910), p. 100-103. Mackworth reported to this on 5 August to William Pierrepont, a member of the Derby House Committee, which oversaw the war effort, requesting extra funds to reinforce Shrewsbury's defences.Auden (1910), p. 99-100. He wanted 250 more men for the garrison, so that he could have rotating daily shifts on guard overnight. He also needed ¬£200 to repair and resupply the castle itself. The events seem to have made a great impression. Derby House gave Mackworth exactly what he asked and on 8 August the House of Lords approved the grants and received and recorded the report and the accompanying letter from Mackworth.House of Lords Journal Volume 10: 8 August 1648 Meanwhile, the Committee entrusted Mackworth with the task of securing Montgomery Castle, imperilled by the impending death of Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Cherbury (although the Committee thought he was already dead):Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1648‚Äì1649, January 1648, p. 232. Samuel More was appointed governorCalendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1648‚Äì1649, January 1648, p. 235-6. and the castle secured. On 24 August the Shropshire committee were able to release a large quantity of arms and ammunition to the mayor and corporation to equip a citizen guard for the town.Auden (1910), p. 103. e =Division and disaster= Although, this was the last significant royalist attempt in Shropshire, although the county's royalists continued to support outbreaks in Wales in Herefordshire. The scale and scope of the year's warfare beyond Shropshire will have become clear as large numbers of Scottish prisoners, mainly captured after the defeat of James Hamilton, 1st Duke of Hamilton by Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Preston, were kept in the county on their way to enslavement.Auden (1910), p. 108-9. The events of the summer seem to have stiffened Mackworth's support for the radicals in the army. His response to Pride's Purge of parliament was entirely positive and a letter from Mackworth and his officers to Fairfax was read on 26 December in the House of Commons, asking that \\"his Excellency would endeavour that justice may done upon the Authors of our troubles and bloodshed in the three Kingdoms in some exemplary way.\\"Auden (1910), p. 110. This was the day that the Rump Parliament ordered its committee on bringing the king to justice to prepare ordinances for his trial.House of Commons Journal Volume 6: 26 December 1648 The execution of the king was followed by considerable royalist agitation but no rising in Shropshire.Auden (1910), p. 112-3. However, there was a serious incident of internal dissent in August, when a cavalry troop heading for Ireland were attacked by a mob led by Robert Clive, disarmed and robbed of their horse ‚Äì a protest against continuing militarisation.Coulton, p. 112. Sir Robert Harley, a distant relative of Mackworth, who was refused permission to settle in Shrewsbury. In 1650 the Oath of Engagement, which partly contradicted the Solemn League and Covenant, divided puritan ranks. Paget, Mackworth's minister at Chad's, preached in favour, but many of the other ministers were opposed. In May disagreements over the Engagement forced Mackworth to reject a request from a distant relative, Sir Robert Harley to take up residence in Shrewsbury: Harley a moderate Presbyterian and parliamentarian from Herefordshire, settled instead at Ludlow, just inside Shropshire.Coulton, p. 114. Mackworth's correspondence with Sir Robert was vetted by the English Council of State.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1650, 2 April 1650, p. 75. The issue was overlaid by an outbreak of bubonic plague, which spread rapidly from its first appearance at Frankwell in June.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 465. Mackworth quarantined affected soldiers and the administration was conducted from Atcham.Phillips and Auden (eds), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.261. The quarter sessions brought in a local levy for relief of the infected and the poor.Phillips and Auden (eds), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.263-5. Mackworth was ordered to eject the Presbyterian ministers who refused the Engagement in August, including Samuel Fisher at Mary's and Thomas Blake of Alkmund's,Auden (1907), p. 282. although both were active in pastoral care during the plague.Coulton, p. 115. The Council of State wrote on 10 August expressing security concerns, as it feared the garrison might be depleted. Mackworth was told to close the schools in the town and to evacuate any infected houses close to the castle or gates. By November the plague was dying way, although it continued to kill until January 1651.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 466. The poor were worst affected and about half the victims died in the pest houses, to which the sick were taken. The total numbers are unknown but Chad's parish alone buried 251 plague victims between June 1650 and January 1651. Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. iii. The end of the plague allowed vacant posts to be filled. Richard Heath was appointed to Alkmund's on 23 June. He was recommended for the post by Mackworth and by his teacher and patron, John Milton, and he went on to help in the preparation of the London Polyglot Bible, partly financed by the Commonwealth.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 280. The threat of military operations in the vicinity and other problems delayed an appointment at Mary's and Francis Tallents did not take up the post formally until early 1653.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 2, p. 378-80. =Royalist remnants= Mackworth headed the county sequestration committee, which confiscated and leased out the estates of royalist landowners, pending their reaching a settlement with the Committee for Compounding with Delinquents, based at Goldsmiths' Hall. Mackworth's dealings with the Ottley family are fairly well known from their point of view, as their correspondence is preserved. The county committee began felling Francis Ottley's trees in retribution for his burning of houses while governor or Sheriff.Phillips and Auden (eds), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.241-2. This was quickly forbidden by the Committee for Compounding but it seems that Mackworth and the county committee were slow to comply. In April 1647, a letter from Lucy Ottley, the wife of Sir Francis, to Richard Ottley, their eldest son, mentioned moves by Mackworth and others to prosecute Sir Francis,Phillips and Auden (eds), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.236-7. but the details are unknown and nothing seems to have come of it. Mackworth's name heads the signatories on the document releasing Ottley's lands from sequestration in March 1648, although the financial details were far from settled. Ottley was accused of involvement in the attempted royalist uprising of that summerAuden (1910), p. 94. but apparently never apprehended. There were legal proceedings between Mackworth and Ottley in February 1649, but their nature is not known, although there was apparently difficulty in securing legal officials not related to either party.Phillips and Auden (eds), 1911, Ottley Papers, p.252. Sir Francis completed his business with the compounding Committee in the summer and died later in the year. The crisis of 1651 English satirical view of Charles Stuart's relationship to his Scottish supporters. Charles Stuart, the eldest son of Charles I, was crowned at Scone, Scotland on 1 January 1651. On 15 March the Council of State wrote to Mackworth at Welshpool, warning of the possibility of regional risings in Wales, possibly supported by royalist forces from the Isle of Man.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 15 March 1651, p. 89. As the English parliamentarian army was drawn into fighting the Covenanters in eastern Scotland, tensions rose and early in August, and the Council wrote to Robert Duckenfield, Mackworth and Thomas Birch, ordering them to recruit a thousand new soldiers from the militia companies: part to free experienced troops from garrison duty and the other part to march with the veterans to Scotland.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 1‚Äì2 August 1651, p. 302. Charles was able to slip over the border with a large army on 6 August, heading south as quickly as possible. Thomas Harrison sent urgent messages to Mackworth and the governors of other towns, including Stafford and Chester, to warn them that the Scottish army might pass their way. Thomas Mackworth, Humphrey eldest son, was one of the officers with the garrison and it was reported the town was in \\"good posture\\" on 16 August. Approaching through Cheshire, Charles and his largely Scottish army camped at Tong Norton on 20 August.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 467. There were a few defectors, including John Benbowe, a hero of the capture of the town in 1645. Charles the wrote to Mackworth requesting him to surrender the town and the castle: :I cannot but persuade my self you will do it, when I consider you a gentleman of an ancient house, and of very different principles, as I am informed, from those with whom your employment ranks you at present. Mackworth's reply took no notice of Charles's claim to kingship but was addressed: \\"For the Commander-in-Chief of the Scottish Army.\\" He flatly rejected all attempts to win him over and declared: :I resolve to be found unremoveable the faithful servant of The Commonwealth of England: and if you believe me to be a gentleman, you may believe I will be faithful to my trust. What principles I am judged to be of, I know not: but I hope they are such as shall ever declare me honest; and no way differing from those engaged in the same employment with me, ‚Äî unless they should desert that cause they are imbarqued in. On 27 August both letters were read in the House of Commons, which voted to send Mackworth a medal attached to a gold chain valued at ¬£100, \\"as a Mark of the Parliament's Favour, and good Acceptance of his Fidelity.\\"House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 27 August 1651 The business was duly passed on to Alderman Francis Allen, a regicide and goldsmith.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 27 August 1651, p. 374. As before when in favour, Mackworth seems to have used the opportunity to extract more money for his hard-pressed garrison: the Council of State assured him it would honour a ¬£100 bill for contingent expenses.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 28 August 1651, p. 382. Mackworth was quick to spend the money and it was ordered paid on 19 September.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 28 August 1651, p. 439. The Scots had moved on and were soundly defeated on 3 September by Oliver Cromwell at the Battle of Worcester. Legal and judicial appointments In September 1647 Mackworth added the recordership of Wenlock to that of Shrewsbury and, at some stage, he also became recorder of Bridgnorth, although this is not attested before December 1653, when he was ordered to consider a petition concerning compensation for the burning of the town more than seven years earlier.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1653‚Äì1654, 2 Feb 1654, p. 281. In March 1648 he was appointed Attorney General for North Wales, alongside his Gray's Inn colleague Thomas Fell.House of Commons Journal Volume 5: 6 March 1648 In June Mackworth was granted a commission of oyer and terminer to sit with Peter Warburton and Robert Duckenfield to try conspirators arrested by William Brereton in connection with a royalist plot to seize Chester Castle.House of Commons Journal Volume 5: 29 June 1648 In the same year he became Vice Chamberlain of the Palatine County of Chester. This involved preparing cases to be decided by the Chamberlain, who headed the county's judiciaryYates (ed), Rights and Jurisdiction of the County of Chester, p. 6. and administration, as well as deputising for him on the numerous occasions he was absent. A manuscript thought to date from around the time of Mackworth's birthYates (ed), Rights and Jurisdiction of the County of Chester, p. 12. seeks to define the preconditions for the success of the distinct local judicial system of Cheshire: :Fyrste that there bee a good Vice Chamberlaine appointed to governe the Courte well and to please and content the Countrey, who must bee no comon Lawyer, such being men more fitt to bee imploied in Courtes of Learninge then in cases of Conscience, for yf those shall bee corrupted with affection (as all men of flesh and bloud may bee) they have a farre greater scope to do amysse than other men, inclyninge sometimes on the one side with the Lawe...It will be good therefore in this Office, to appointe an honest reasonable gentleman to be Vice Chamberlayne, such a one as feareth God, regardeth the honor of him under whom hee serveth, and respecteth his own credytte.'Yates (ed), Rights and Jurisdiction of the County of Chester, p. 25-6. Mackworth seems to have done his best to \\"please and content the country\\" promising to exercise circumspection in issuing writs relating to the City of Chester, where there were jurisdictional conflicts dating back at least a century.Lewis and Thacker, Early modern Chester 1550‚Äì1762: The civil war and interregnum, 1642‚Äì60 In 1649 Mackworth was appointed deputy chief justice of the Chester circuit. On 20 July 1649 he was consequently removed from his post as attorney general,House of Commons Journal Volume 6: 20 July 1649 as was Fell, who was moved to join him at the Chester circuit, taking the post of Puisne Justice of Chester: fittingly they were called to the bench of their Inn together in the following year. The Earl of Derby, executed after Mackworth presided over his trial. James Nayler, a Quaker leader, being pilloried and whipped, in stark contrast to Harrison's treatment by Mackworth and Fell. Mackworth was active in trials resulting from the royalist uprisings and invasion of 1651. By May there were numbers of suspects in custody at Chester and Liverpool and the Council of State recruited Mackworth to help with investigations.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 10 May 1651, p. 192. In June he was seconded as a commissioner, along with Mytton and others, to the court dealing with a rebellion in Cardiganshire.House of Commons Journal Volume 6: 25 June 1651 A week after the Battle of Worcester, the Council of State resolved that James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby, and a number of other key figures in the invasion and the supporting rebellions should face a show trial before a \\"council of war\\" in Chester, specifying Mackworth first and foremost to take part in the reckoning.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 10 September 1651, p. 422. The trials were held under a specific act of 12 August, prohibiting communication with Charles Stuart.August 1651: An Act prohibiting Correspondence with Charles Stuart or his Party. Among the others tried before Mackworth in October were Sir Timothy Fetherstonhaugh, and John Benbow. Derby had led the incursion from the Isle of Man and Fetherstonhaugh had joined the ensuing Lancashire rebellion, defeated at the Battle of Wigan Lane. Although he was acting as judge, not prosecutor, the Council briefed Mackworth on how best to present witnesses and evidence against the defendants,Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 25 September 1651, p. 447-8.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 27 September 1651, p. 452. as well as supplying him with its own papers to be introduced into the proceedings as he saw fit.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 30 September 1651, p. 454. They were subsequently found guilty and beheaded. The defector Benbow was discovered hiding in ShrewsburyCoulton, p. 116. and was named as one of the \\"fit persons to be brought to trial, and made examples of justice,\\" grouped with Derby and Fetherstonhaugh as a prime example.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 11 September 1651, p. 423-4. The Council of State singled him out in a letter to Mackworth as requiring to be tried \\"speedily and effectually.\\"Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1651, 30 September 1651, p. 457-8. After his trial he was returned to Shrewsbury and executed by firing squad in a cabbage patch, from which he had taken part in the storming of the town six years previously.Owen and Blakeway, Volume 1, p. 468. All the executions took place on 15 October: Benbow was buried in Chad's churchyard the following day. Register of St Chad's, Shrewsbury, p. 228. At the assizes of April 1652 Mackworth and Fell presided over the case of a Quaker or Ranter named Harrison,Coulton, p. 118. who had proclaimed a radically interior interpretation of Christianity, denying the reality of the afterlife. Presumably considering the matter insufficiently serious for their court, they remitted it to the magistrates, who expressed distaste for Harrison's views but resolved to \\"hear no more of the business.\\" It was after this that Fell returned home to Swarthmoor Hall to find his wife had opened the house to a Quaker community. Mackworth appears to have retained his interest in the humbler levels of law and justice even after his preferments. Extant orders of the Shropshire quarter sessions, which begin at Michaelmas 1652, show him attending as a justice of the peace. He appeared at the head of the list of justices (which was not always recorded), for Epiphany,Wakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 2. TrinityWakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 5. and Michaelmas 1653,Wakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 7. and Epiphany 1654,Wakeman (ed), Orders of the Quarter Sessions, p. 9. so it is likely he attended regularly when available. The magistrates were mainly members of the county committee and included on occasions Thomas Mytton. National prominence For just under a year, before his untimely death, Mackworth was at the centre of national affairs in the newly created Protectorate =Protector's Council= John Lilburne. Mackworth was one of the committee that recommended his internment on Jersey. Oliver Cromwell in 1656 by Samuel Cooper. The Protector's Council nominated Mackworth as a new member to Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector, on 2 February 1654Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1653‚Äì1654, 2 Feb 1654, p. 382. and he swore the oath and took his seat for the first time five days later.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1653‚Äì1654, 7 Feb 1654, p. 391. He was immediately given legal work as part of a committee on a testamentary issue. As early as 9 February he was deputed with three other members to prepare a report on the complex financial legacy of Sir Peter Temple, 2nd Baronet, whose widow Christian n√©e Leveson, had Shropshire connections.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1653‚Äì1654, 9 Feb 1654, p. 396. The following day he was appointed to a committee with plenary powers to investigate and propose improvements to the entire system of government finance.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1653‚Äì1654, 10 Feb 1654, p. 398. On 21 February it was a committee to investigate speedily ways of improving debt proceedings for traders in the City of London. Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1653‚Äì1654, 21 Feb 1654, p. 411. This set the tone for his involvement, which was active and regular, employing both his legal and his political skills. However, the range of duties was very wide and sometimes tedious: in March alone Mackworth was put on a rota to dine with ambassadors from the Dutch RepublicCalendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 2 March 1654, p. 3. and from France.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 28 March 1654, p. 54. As he now needed to spend most of his time in London, he was given a government mews house, previously inhabited by John Hewson.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 9 March 1654, p. 17. It was a busy year, with the Council meeting most days. Mackworth attended 159 meetings out of a possible 176.Calculated by Johnstone, p. 272., based on attendance tables in Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1653‚Äì1654, p. xxxix. and Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, p. xliv. In a number of cases, Mackworth was closely involved in moves to move aside opponents of the r√©gime, who came from diverse standpoints and were treated in often very different ways. On 8 March he was one of a committee of three deputed to examine the case of the Levellers' leader John Lilburne,Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 9 March 1654, p. 16. detained by the government the previous year, although acquitted of all charges. Eight days later they recommended he be sent to Mount Orgueil Castle on Jersey.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 16 March 1654, p. 33-4. On 23 March he was put on a committee to investigate the dispute between Elizabeth, Countess Dirletoun, and a group of improvers concerned in the construction of the River Wey Navigation, headed by James Pitson.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 23 March 1654, p. 49. Lady Elizabeth was the widow of William Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Hamilton, who was killed at the Battle of Worcester. She had refused the compensation offered by the developers for building on her land and had been breaking down the banks of the river, finally demolishing a building that had been in use as a government powder magazine, claiming that she feared for the lives of her family. As the scheme had been approved by Parliament and was clearly in the interests of trade, there was little chance that objectors would prevail, but the committee's recommendations were moderate. Pitson was granted an order protecting his investment and requesting the county authorities take more care to keep the peace. However, as Lady Dirlestoun would not accept ¬£200, he was to pay her ¬£10 10s. a year and then buy the land off her heirs.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 23 March 1654, p. 52. More generally, Mackworth was deputed to a number of committees dealing with censorship. In relation to perceived social evils of the day, Mackworth reported on the Protector's response to draft legislation to end cockfightingCalendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 31 March 1654, p. 67. and was appointed to the committee preparing legislation to suppress duelling:Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 25 April 1654, p. 115. apparently a direct response to a brawl between John James, a Worcestershire veteran of the Civil War, and the irascible Charles Rich. Sometimes he was deputed to deal with regional matters in which he had specialist knowledge, as when a law had to be passed allowing Sir George Warburton, the High Sheriff of Cheshire, to move his court to Nantwich because of a plague outbreak in Chester.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, 28 April 1654, p. 131. =The First Protectorate Parliament= In 1654, Mackworth was one of the four elected members of parliament for Shropshire in the First Protectorate Parliament: a single chamber parliament, established under the Instrument of Government, with a ¬£200 property qualification.Roots, p.201. His fellow MPs were Philip Young, his son-in-law,Coulton, p.123. Mytton and Robert Corbet. His son, the younger Humphrey Mackworth, was returned as an MP for Shrewsbury and his brother-in-law, William Crowne was MP for Bridgnorth. Parliament assembled on 3 September. The majority of the members elected were Presbyterian in inclinationRoots, p.204. and many were there primarily to dismantle the new political dispensation,Roots, p.205. which was prohibited by Clause 12 of the Instrument of Government itself. On Monday 5 September, the first day of business, Mackworth was appointed to the important Committee of Privileges, which dealt with the freedoms and obligations of members and was given just three weeks to consider objections to any returns.House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 5 September 1654 Other committees tended to reflect his established interests. On 15 September he was appointed to a committee to examine the proceedings of the judges at Salters' Hall:House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 15 September 1654 the very great powers of the livery company, which was able to regulate many aspects of the daily life as well as the work of its members, seem to have become controversial and Mackworth had considerable experience in dealing with City institutions. Three days later he was added to a deputation to take to the Protector a resolution declaring a fast day:House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 18 September 1654 for puritans a period devoted to public prayer and repentance rather than of specific dietary restriction. On 22 September he was appointed to a committee on \\"abuses in printing\\", charged not only with investigating the boom in dissident publication but also with preventing meanwhile the publication of books and journals as it saw fit.House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 22 September 1654 On 25 September he was appointed to two committees in a single sitting.House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 25 September 1654 The first was to consider a bill prescribing a Recognition of Government: an oath recognising the Protectorate, using the words of Clause 12 of the Instrument, that had been accepted in principle a week earlier. The second was to on a bill for the dismissal of inadequate clergy and schoolmasters. The ordinance itself appointed him a commissioner for Shropshire, Cheshire and the counties of North Wales.August 1654: An Ordinance for ejecting Scandalous, Ignorant and insufficient Ministers and Schoolmasters. An ordinance of September nominatedMackworth a Visitor of the University of Oxford.September 1654: An Ordinance for appointing Visitors for the Universities. Further committees were on Scotland,House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 29 September 1654 the Court of Chancery,House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 5 October 1654 a petition from William Killigrew (1606‚Äì1695) over problems developing the Lincolnshire Fens,House of Commons Journal Volume 7: 31 October 1654 and another from Lord CravenHouse of Commons Journal Volume 7: 3 November 1654 an immensely wealthy royalist who was seeking the return of his property. During November the parliament began to discuss plans to reduce the size of the army and the strength of garrisons. However, Cromwell listed Shrewsbury as one of those requiring further consideration, probably influenced by Mackworth's evaluation of its strategic importance. The parliament was to prove entirely fruitless, dismissed on 22 January 1655, with no legislation enacted, and with a final harangue from an exasperated Protector.Roots, p. 208-9. However, Mackworth was dead and buried by this time. Death Memorial to the exhumed and reburied Parliamentarians at St Margaret's, Westminster. Mackworth died in London some time in December 1654, perhaps suddenly, as he died intestate. However, he last attended Council on 5 December, missing meetings on the 12th, 16th and 19th of the month,Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, p. xliv. which makes a short illness possible. The last mention of him in action has him presenting to the Council the papers of \\"Emanuel Martyns Dorindo, alias David Abrabanell, a Hebrew,\\"Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1654, p. 407. about a year before the tacit acceptance of the resettlement of Jews in England. He was given a state funeralJohnstone, p. 273. in the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey, as 'Colonel,' at night on 26 December. Mackworth's widow, Mary, was in some difficulty because of his intestacy. On 14 March 1655 her mews home was assigned to Major-General Philip Skippon, pending her vacating the premises.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1655, p. 76. Edmund King, who acted as an assistant to Mackworth in his work for the State, also seems to have suffered financially and was given ¬£30 by the Council in June 1655, with the recommendation that Cromwell find him a suitable post, possibly in the customs service.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1655, p. 204. Johnstone says Mrs Mackworth was allowed ¬£300 for funeral expenses, and Coulton follows, stating that \\"his burial was paid for by the state at a cost of ¬£300.\\" The State Papers seem to show that only in March 1657 did the Protector's Council did give his widow ¬£300 towards the funeral costs. Moreover, this was not a grant but part of Mackworth's pay arrears,Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1656‚Äì1657 p. 313. which appear to have been considerable, as a further ¬£300 was paid to his son and executor at the same time, using Walter Strickland as intermediary. In May 1658 Mackworth's daughter Anne petitioned the Council: :My father served in civil and military offices all through the wars to his death, and died 3 years ago intestate, without providing for me, on which you have several times promised to settle something on me. I implore you to order your good intentions to be executed.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1658‚Äì1659 p. 35. This was sent for favourable consideration to the Privy Council, again via Strickland, and a committee set up to consult with the younger Humphrey Mackworth on what to offer. In December of the same year, three months after Oliver Cromwell's death, a pension of ¬£160 was at last settled on Mrs Mackworth.Calendar of State Papers, Domestic Series, 1658‚Äì1659 p. 224. After the Restoration (1660) Mackworth was regarded as attainted and as a regicide, although he was never named in an act of attainder and was not one of the judges at the trial of Charles I. His body was disinterred in September 1661, with other servants of the Commonwealth buried in Westminster Abbey,Cf. Memorial plaque. and buried in an unmarked pit in the churchyard of St Margaret's, Westminster. Marriages and family The Mackworth pedigree,Blakeway, p. 390-6. including Humphrey's family, was explored by John Brickdale Blakeway in an article covering Betton Strange, published in 1889 but written about 80 years earlier. Humphrey Mackworth married twice and both marriages produced children. Anne Waller was Mackworth's first wife. They were married by May 1624. She was the daughter of Thomas Waller of Beaconsfield, and distantly related to the poet Edmund Waller, who was also born in Beaconsfield. She was buried at St Chad's on 26 May 1636.

These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean, north of the equator and west of the international date line in Oceania and East Asia.

Plot The movie is based on the true story of the gang war that lasted between two groups in the 80s and 90s in Ghaziabad, India. In the town of Ghaziabad, Brahmapal Choudhary (Paresh Rawal) is a corrupt chairman, and has connections with the gangster Fauji (Arshad Warsi), who is willing to do anything to make a quick buck. When Brahmapal refuses to pay up to 2 million for Fauji's sisters wedding, Fauji breaks their ties and leaves him. At the same time, Brahmapal befriends a polite teacher named Satbir (Vivek Oberoi) who also happens to be in a relationship with Brahmapal's daughter Suman (Charmy Kaur). Thinking that Brahmapal has replaced him with Satbir, Fauji becomes furious and joins forces with Rashid (Ravi Kishan), a politician and Brahampal's enemy. Rashid deliberately turns Fauji against Satbir, making him think that he wants him dead. When Fauji tries to attack Satbir, an elderly village spokesman is shot, leading Satbir to fight back against him. But before Satbir is able to do anything about it, Satbir's older brother Karamvir (Chandrachur Singh) is kidnapped, and soon killed by Fauji. Seeking revenge, Satbir turns to the crime world to finish off his brother's murderer. With riots taking place all over, the police department shifts a crazy, tough, feared and solid officer, Thakur Pritam Singh (Sanjay Dutt) to enter the city bring a stop to this gang- war. However, Pritam Singh ends up making it all worse. Pritam Singh initially visits Fauji and Rashid and later on, invites Satbir to the Police Station. Having gauged their attitudes, Pritam Singh decides to side with Satbir in the war against Fauji and Rashid. With elections approaching, both parties eventually decide to contest with Rashid and Satbir's brother contesting. Rashid wins the election seeing which Fauji goes on a killing spree beginning his attack starting from Satbir's house and accidentally ends up killing Satbir's now wife Suman. Enraged at this act of Fauji, Satbir's brother kidnaps his girlfriend ‚Äì an act that is looked down upon by Satbir. Before she could be returned safely, Fauji invades the place and kills Satbir's brother prompting a furious Satbir to go on a revenge spree. In the meanwhile, a tape is discovered which not only reveals that Rashid and Faqira have secretly made a deal with Pritam Singh to murder Fauji, thereby betraying him, but also shows Faqira confessing to having ordered the attack on Fauji's house at the start of the movie which is what triggered the whole gang-war in the first place. Furious at this betrayal, Fauji kills Faqira and then heads out to kill Rashid. Pritam Singh also joins in, apparently fulfilling his promise to kill Fauji for Rashid but ends up killing Rashid instead. This results in an action-packed finale that sees Satbir killing Fauji and being arrested by Pritam Singh. His fate then is left unknown.

It has become a standard of the Latin music repertoire, with notable performances by artists such as Cuarteto Mach√≠n, Daniel Santos, Noro Morales and Ibrahim Ferrer. This bolero should not be confused with the omelenk√≥ of the same name composed by Elsa Angulo Mac√≠as and recorded by Celia Cruz with La Sonora Matancera in 1953. Recordings =Buena Vista Social Club= Recorded by various artists in the world of Hispanic music, it came to wider prominence when it was included in the Oscar- nominated soundtrack of the 1999 documentary film Buena Vista Social Club, set in Cuba and directed by Wim Wenders.Details on the Buena Vista Social Club film at IMDb The song was sung by well-known singers Ibrahim Ferrer and Omara Portuondo, and conducted by Juan de Marcos Gonz√°lez, featuring Ry Cooder on guitar. The scene from the film in which the song is performed is particularly poignant because the age of the performers (72 and 69, respectively; the oldest bandmember was 91 and several others were over 80 years old) is contrasted by the freshness and emotional intensity of the performance, in which she is moved to tears that he tenderly brushes away. The song was not included in the Buena Vista Social Club eponymous album, but rather in Ferrer's Buena Vista Social Club Presents Ibrahim Ferrer, released in 1999 by World Circuit. =Other versions= At the height of his career (the late 1950s until his death in 1964), the Puerto Rican pianist and bandleader Noro Morales released a series of recordings of ballroom rumba pieces arranged for his sextet, without vocals and with (an innovation) the piano playing both melody and rhythm. Several of his successes were composed by Hern√°ndez, among them \\"Silencio\\". The 1969 Mexican film \\"El jibarito Rafael\\", set in Puerto Rico, has a scene where a tuxedo-clad singer (Felipe Pirela) sings the song as he wanders around the nightclub where the protagonist couple are sitting, to end up facing the girl directly as he begins the phrase \\"Silencio ...\\" Details on El jibarito Rafael at IMDB Lyrics The first two lines of the song, \\"Duermen en mi jard√≠n / Las blancas azucenas\\", translates as Sleeping in my garden / The white lilies. The order of these lines is reversed in some versions. The third line, Los nardos y las rosas or The tuberoses and the roses, is omitted entirely from some versions. Further lines of the song talk about a tormented soul: And my soul, very sad and heavy, Wants to hide from the flowers, Its bitter pain. The singer hides their true feelings: I don't want the flowers to know, The torments life sends me, If they knew what I suffer. With my pains, they too would cry. The point is reiterated: Silence; let them sleep, The nards and the lilies. I don't want them to know my sadness. The final line, repeated three times, translates as Because, if they see me crying, they‚Äôll die. All the flowers mentioned are heavily scented, and hence have a palpable and evocative presence, even at night, in the dark, when they are \\"sleeping\\". This attribute leads to the conceit that the flowers are as sensitive to human emotions, just as humans are to their scents.

The defining feature of the peasants are that they are typically seen to be only partly integrated into the market economy - an economy which, in societies with a significant peasant population, is typically found to have many imperfect, incomplete or missing markets. Peasant economics treats peasants as something different from other farmers as they are not assumed to be simply small profit maximizing farmers; by contrast, peasant economics covers a wide range of different theories of peasant household behavior. These include various assumptions about the maximization of profits, risk aversion, drudgery aversion, and sharecropping. The assumptions, logic, and predictions of these theories are examined and the impact of subsistence is typically found to have important implications in terms of producers decisions about supply, consumption and price. Chayanov was an early proponent of the importance of understanding peasant behaviour arguing that peasants would work as hard as they needed in order to meet their subsistence needs, but had no incentive beyond those needs and therefore would slow and stop working once they were met. This principle, the consumption- labour-balance principle, implies that the peasant household will increase its work until it meets (balances) the needs (consumption) of the household. A possible implication of this view of peasant societies is that they will not develop without some external, added factor. Peasant economics has been seen as being an important area of study by some development economists, agricultural sociologists, and anthropologists.Ellis, Frank (1988) Peasant Economics: Farm Households and Agrarian Development.

Authorship  The chronicle has no identifiable author, was probably composed by multiple authors and editors from a variety of sources, and frequently revised over a period of several centuries. The chronicle was, however, probably written by someone with an intimate knowledge of the geography the B≈çs≈ç region from the time of the chronicle into the Edo period.  Composition  The chronicle is a regional example of a \\"gunki monogatari\\" (ËªçË®òÁâ©Ë™û), or war tale written primarily in the Kamakura and Muromachi periods that focus on wars and conflicts. It consists of one volume, and is arranged in chronological order by event. Its exact time of authorship is also unknown. The B≈çs≈ç Chiran-Ki is traditionally dated to the beginning of the Edo period, and was probably started between 1596 and finished as late as the 1660s. The chronicle is generally thought of to be an accurate account of regional conflicts in Kazusa Province, but the veracity of many parts of the account are uncertain. In spite of its many flaws, the document is one of the most important existing document concerning local history of a large part of Chiba Prefecture prior to the Meiji period. The earliest manuscript of the B≈çs≈ç Chiran-Ki dates to 1668 and is now held by the National Archives of Japan. A modern printing of the chronicle was released as part of a long series of source documents of the B≈çs≈ç region by the B≈çs≈ç S≈çsho Kank≈çkai in 1940.B≈çs≈ç S≈çsho Kank≈çkai. B≈çs≈ç s≈çsho. Chiba: B≈çs≈ç S≈çsho Kank≈çkai, 1912-1940.  Contents  The B≈çs≈ç Chiran-Ki primarily details the circumstances surrounding local conflicts and the hostilities between regional commanders. It notably records the division, from approximately 1587, of traditional ‚Äúfudai‚Äù fiefdoms from local leaders by the Tokugawa clan, the inevitable demise of the fiefdoms by Hideyoshi Toyotomi after the Siege of Odawara in 1590. The chronicle especially richly details the conflict between the castle lords of Kazusa Province, specifically: *Yoritada Masaki, Awa Masaki clan, lord of Katsuura Castle in present-day Katsuura City, *Yoriharu Toki, Toki clan, lord of Mangi Castle in present-day Isumi City,* *Toyonobu Takeda, Takeda clan, lord of Ch≈çnan Castle in present-day Chonan,* *Yoshiyasu Satomi, Satomi clan, lord of ≈åtaki Castle in the present-day town of ≈åtaki.* The chronicle also describes the devastating Kazusa earthquake of 1601. It ends with an account of Rodrigo de Vivero. Rodrigo, a Spanish noble and governor-elect to the Philippines, was shipwrecked off the Pacific Ocean coast of the B≈çs≈ç Peninsula in present-day Onjuku in 1609, visited ≈åtaki Castle and the capitol Edo.

He is a member of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan for the riding of Rosthern-Shellbrook. He served in the executive council of Brad Wall from 2014‚Äì2017, twice as Minister of Environment and as Minister of Advanced Education, after which he resigned to launch his campaign for the leadership of the Saskatchewan Party.  Early life  Moe was born in Prince Albert and raised on a farm near Shellbrook. He graduated from the University of Saskatchewan with a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture. He later worked in various community initiatives in and near Shellbrook, including the Economic Development Corporation, and the Shellbrook and District Physician Recruitment committee, which seeks to attract general practitioners to rural areas of the province without convenient access to local medical facilities. In the mid-1990s, while still attending university, Moe and his wife established a farming business, buying equipment and renting land. By the early 2000s, he had filed for bankruptcy with $208,500 in assets and $320,900 in liabilities.\\"Premier Scott Moe filed for bankruptcy after family farm business became insolvent\\".

Saskatoon Star Phoenix, March 14, 2016. In 1994, Moe, was again charged with impaired driving as well as leaving the scene of an accident. This was not disclosed until the 2020 Saskatchewan provincial election, when questions of his previous driving record and impaired driving charges were raised.[https://twitter.com/AHiddyCBC/status/1313882786944622592 On May 29 1997, Moe was in an accident in which a 39-year-old woman, Joanne Balog, lost her life. Her 18-year old son, the only other passenger, survived with a broken rib. The RCMP determined he attempted to cross the highway when it was unsafe and gave Moe a ticket for driving without due care and attention, as there was no malicious intent determined. While Moe stated alcohol was not a factor, he also claimed he couldn't recall the incident happening, which is likely due to shock from being in a collision. \\"Scott Moe says 1997 collision that left 1 person dead has shaped his life, career\\". CBC News, September 8, 2017.  Political career  Moe was first elected to the Legislative Assembly in the 2011 election, and re-elected in the 2016 election\\"First time MLA Scott Moe not taking win for granted\\". Prince Albert Now, November 8, 2011. as a Saskatchewan Party MLA. Scott served as a member of the legislature‚Äôs Standing Committee on Crown and Central Agencies and was deputy chair of the legislature‚Äôs Standing Committee on Public Accounts. Moe entered Cabinet on June 5, 2014 as Minister of Environment and Minister responsible for SaskWater and the Water Security Agency. On May 21, 2015, he was appointed as Minister of Advanced Education. On August 23, 2016, Moe returned to his former role as Minister of Environment and Minister responsible for SaskWater and the Water Security Agency. = Environment Minister = On October 3, 2016, while provincial Environment Ministers were meeting with Federal Environment Minister Catherine McKenna to work on an agreement to reduce emissions as a collective nation, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau rose in the House of Commons to announce the federal government's plan to introduce a carbon tax for provinces that did not have one. Moe and two other Ministers walk out of the meeting with the Federal Environment Minister, describing the federal government's actions a reminiscent of a 'national energy program 2.0.' Observers and pundits in the province have called the carbon tax \\"his issue from the beginning\\", pointing out the Premier is largely on-side with public opinion in Saskatchewan, where polls have placed opposition against the tax as high as 88%. While he was Minister of the Environment and responsible for the Water Security Agency, Moe met with a fellow Saskatchewan Party Member of the Legislative Assembly, Bill Boyd, regarding Boyd's personal irrigation projects. The projects were reviewed by Moe, and later found to have illegally cultivated protected grasslands and involved building irrigation infrastructure into a river without obtaining the proper licensing permits. Regarding the process, Moe commented that he did not discuss the matter with Boyd after he was made aware that the project was in contravention of the Wildlife Habitat Protection Act, but that \\"There was a failure in following the law.\\" When asked about specifics of the meeting with Boyd, such as where it was, when it was, who all attended, if there was a record of the meeting, or how it came about, Moe said he could not recall or did not know. Boyd was fined a total of $35,000 in relation to two charges laid in 2017 and ordered to remediate the shoreline violation. He was also removed from the Saskatchewan Party caucus by then-premier Brad Wall over the matter, and eventually resigned his position as a Member of the Legislative Assembly. = Saskatchewan Party Leadership Campaign = On September 1, Moe formally launched his campaign for the leadership of the Saskatchewan Party with the backing of 21 cabinet and caucus members, primarily from rural Saskatchewan. Moe's campaign promises focused on restoring $30 million in education funding to Saskatchewan schools, as well as the PST on health, life, and accident insurance products, and a renewed focus on trade and exports Saskatchewan undertakes with customers around the world. During his campaign to replace outgoing premier Brad Wall, Moe stated that he does not personally support abortion, and that he would support a discussion of parental notification and parental consent for women to have an abortion. In an interview with the anti- abortion group Right Now, Moe suggested he would be open to legislation to limit the time frame in which a woman could have an abortion. On January 27, 2018, he was elected the new leader of the Saskatchewan Party, beating Alanna Koch with 54%, or 8075 of 14,989 votes, on the fifth ballot. He was sworn in as premier and appointed his first Cabinet on February 2, 2018. = Priorities as Premier = Moe with Andrew Scheer in November 2019. 100 days after being sworn-in as Premier, Moe restored $30 million in education funding to classrooms, as well as the PST exemption on life, health, and accident insurance products. Moe has also followed former Premier Brad Wall in opposing a federal carbon tax, citing Saskatchewan's environmental policies in sectors such as agriculture. Moe has also been an advocate for getting pipelines built. He supported legislation to \\"turn off the taps\\" for oil to British Columbia for their opposition to pipeline construction, and has also publicly called on the federal government to restrict infrastructure funding to provinces that oppose federally-approved and regulated pipelines that cross provincial borders. Moe has made trade with other nations a focus of his government, replacing the Ministry of the Economy with the Ministry of Trade and Export Development, and has undertaken a number of international trade missions. Those missions include travel to Saskatchewan's largest trading partner, the United States, to meet with Senators, Congressmen, and members of President Donald Trump's cabinet, a mission to China, Saskatchewan's second- largest trading partner, a mission to India, Saskatchewan's third-largest trade market, and a mission in October 2019 to Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong.

The term ALGF/√ñLSF stands for both an annual meeting of activists and an umbrella association of important LGBT organisations in Austria. In 1999, the Austrian Lesbian and Gay Forum concluded its activity.  Annual meetings  The √ñLSF conferences took place in seven of nine Austrian provinces and were organized mainly by local groups and associations. These meetings furthered the development of a proud and self-confident identity of Austria's LGBT community: * 1991 Linz * 1992 Innsbruck * 1993 Graz * 1994 Wien: Alpengl√ºhen [ Glow of the Alps] with Avantgarde Festival UP-artIn German, the term Abart or abartig stands for abnormal, deformed, deviant or kinky. It was used heavily by Nazi oppressors against homosexuals and against any kind of sexual deviation. The english term UP-art sounds alike - with a whole different meaning. * 1995 Linz: Donauwellen [Waves of the Danube] * 1996 Dornbirn: L(i)eben gegen den Strom [Loving and living against the stream] * 1997 St. P√∂lten: Lebenswelten - Menschenrechte [Living environments - Human rights] * 1998 Klagenfurt The conferences emphasised on political and cultural discourse, but also included hedonistic workshops and events - like Tinkering dildos, Darkrooms for Lesbians, a lecture by Hermes Phettberg in a public toilet, midnight readings and dance interludes. The plenary with representatives from all over Austria always took place on the last day of the conference, it discussed in length all resolutions brought forward and voted on them. Among the most important forum papers agreed upon were the Law Resolution of 1994 and the Transgender Resolution of 1996. In 1994, the controversial proposal of a Resolution for the Abolition of Genders was not adopted.  Umbrella association  In 1994, the plenary of the forum in Vienna decided to institutionalise the forum as association recognized by the law. The founders took some risks, due to ¬ß 221 of the Austrian Penal Code.At the time of the foundation of the forum, in 1995, two paragraphs of the Austrian penal code still threatened every public endeavour of the LGBT community. ¬ß220 penalized the \\"Advertising for same-sex fornication and the fornication with animals\\" with up to six months of prison, ¬ß221 penalized the \\"Forming of associations benefiting same-sex fornication\\" with also up to six months of prison. Therefore all top-level functionaries of the √ñLSF could have legally been brought to court and jailed. Nevertheless, the foundation of the association took place in Graz, on February 4, 1995. Hedwig Pepelnik-Gr√ºndler and Christian Michelides were elected as presidents, Waltraud Riegler from HOSI Wien and Gernot Wartner from HOSI Linz as vice presidents. During the following two years the new institution developed a multitude of activities and was constantly present in the public arena. In June 1995 the founders of the Forum organized the International Human Rights Tribunal against the Republic of Austria. The tribunal was chaired by environmental and human rights activist Freda Meissner-Blau and by Gerhard Oberschlick, editor of FORVM, and was dedicated to the persecution of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender persons in Austria from 1945 to 1995. The Forum was the first Austrian LGBT organisation that successfully invited Austrian politicians to appear and to speak at its public events, like the Appeal to Reason at the Palais Auersperg.At the Tribunal, MP Johannes Jarolim (Social Democratic Party, SP√ñ) spoke as amicus curiae, MP Terezija Stoisits (The Greens) took part in the International Committee, and both MP Volker Kier (Liberal Forum) and Vienna City politician Friedrun Huemer (The Greens) acted as members of the Senate. - At the Appeal to Reason three leading ladies of Austrian politics were speaking: the Federal Minister for Women Affairs, Helga Konrad (SP√ñ), the chairwoman of the Liberal Forum, Heide Schmidt, and the spokeswomen for justiciary of the Green Party, Terezija Stoisits. The debate was moderated by Ulrike Lunacek who decided to become a politician herself during that event. - Key note speakers at the Forum 1996 in Dornbirn were MP Peter Kostelka (chairman of the socialdemocrats in parliament), MP Madeleine Petrovic (chairwoman of the green parliamentary group) and MP Heide Schmidt (chairwoman of the liberal parliamentary group). - In addition there was also an exchange of opinions in Parliament between √ñLSF representatives and conservative MPs Gertrude Brinek and Franz Morak, both from the Austrian People's Party. In 1996 succeeded in founding Austria's first CSD parade, called Rainbow Parade, in supporting the first public blessing of a lesbian couple in an Austrian church and in staging the Dornbirn Forum - against heavy opposition of the local mayor, the catholic Vicar general and large parts of the population of Vorarlberg. Nine title pages and more than 300 letters to the editors of the local newspapers resonated the public outrage. A public reading of selected letters to the editors, held in Vienna by eight prominent personalities and organized by the √ñLSF, infuriated the local opposition even more. In late summer of 1996 the √ñLSF - due to demands from many same sex couples - installed a Blessing Hotline, that promised them to find a priest of their confession. In late fall of 1996 two of the three discriminating paragraphs of the Austrian Penal Code were abolished,¬ß¬ß 220, 221 StGB and this success was widely seen as a result of the intense lobbying work of √ñLSF and its member organisations, like the Human chain for human rights around the parliament on October 10, 1995 during a critical meeting of a parliamentary committee. While hundreds of √ñLSF members demonstrated outside the parliament building, inside two representatives of the associationChristian Michelides and Waltraud Riegler answered the questions of the MPs. At the general assembly in January 1997 the leading team was voted off, which was seen as a coup d'√©tat by most member associations, as the individual members had the same voting powers as the associations. HOSI Wien, the most important pillar of the Forum, left the association. The assertiveness of √ñLSF expired. Although the Forum St. P√∂lten again made headlines - due to the resistance of local bishop Kurt Krenn, ultra catholic publicists and the Israelite Community, the vigor of the rebels slackened. In 1999, √ñLSF was closed down.

Methods for retaining the best talent include maintaining a ‚Äúrelatively jerk-free culture‚Äù and emphasizing the importance of work-life balance, or what Moran called the ‚Äúlife on a tightrope approach.‚Äù Culture of caring gives Plante Moran workers their mission Some of Plante Moran‚Äôs most- emphasized values include their ‚ÄúWe care‚Äù philosophy and the Golden Rule. Their culture has earned them several awards over the years, including FORTUNE‚Äôs Best Places to Work for Millennials, Best Places to Work for Parents, Best Places to Work for Women, and the 100 Best Companies to Work For, as well as several industry-based and geography-based awards.

Often regarded as the first industrialised city, ‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¢ Manchester was a city built by the Industrial Revolution and had little pre-medieval history to speak of. Manchester had a population of 10,000 in 1717, but by 1911 it had burgeoned to 2.3 million.Manchester (England, United Kingdom). Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. As its population and influence burgeoned, Manchester became a centre for new discoveries, scientific breakthroughs and technological developments in engineering. A famous but unattributed quote linked to Manchester is: \\"What Manchester does today, the rest of the world does tomorrow\\". Pioneering breakthroughs such as the first 'true' canal which spawned 'Canal Mania', the first intercity railway station which led to 'railway mania' and the first stored-program computer. The city has achieved great success in the field of physics, with the electron (J. J. Thomson, 1897), proton (Rutherford, 1917), neutron (James Chadwick, 1934) all being discovered by scientists educated (Chadwick and Rutherford) or born (Thomson) in Manchester. Famous scientists to have studied in Manchester include John Dalton, James Prescott Joule, J. J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, James Chadwick and Alan Turing. A creative and often seen as a bohemian city, Manchester also had the highest number of patent applications per head of population in the United Kingdom in 2003. The city is served by the University of Manchester, previously UMIST and the Victoria University of Manchester pre-2004. The university has a total of 25 Nobel Laureates; only the Oxbridge universities have more Nobel laureates. The city is also served by the Museum of Science and Industry celebrating Mancunian, as well as national achievements in both fields. 17th century A romanticised version of William Crabtree observing the transit of Venus by Madox Brown. In 1630, astronomer William Crabtree observed the transit of Venus. Crabtree was born in the hamlet of \\"Broughton Spout\\" which was on the east bank of the River Irwell, near the area now known as \\"The Priory\\" in BroughtonBroughton and Cheetham Hill in Victorian times by Monty Dobkin pages 48&52 and was educated at The Manchester Grammar School.journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=303461 Retrieved 2007-11-13 He married into a wealthy family and worked as a merchant in Manchester. However, in his spare time, his great interest was astronomy. He carefully measured the movements of the planets and undertook precise astronomical calculations. With improved accuracy, he rewrote the existing Rudolphine Tables of Planetary Positions. Crabtree corresponded with Jeremiah Horrocks (who sometimes spelt his name in the Latised form as Horrox), another enthusiastic amateur astronomer, from 1636. A group of astronomers from the north of England, which included William Gascoigne, formed around them and were Britain's first followers of the astronomy of Johannes Kepler. \\"Nos Keplari\\" as the group called themselves, were distinguished as being the first people to gain a realistic notion of the solar system's size.http://www.ucl.ac.uk/sts/nk/birth.htm Retrieved 2007-11-13 Crabtree and Horrocks were the only astronomers to observe, plot, and record the transit of the planet Venus across the Sun, as predicted by Horrocks, on 24 November 1639 (Julian calendar, or 4 December in the Gregorian calendar). They also predicted the next occurrence on 8 June 2004. The two correspondents both recorded the event in their own homes and it is not known whether they ever met in person, but Crabtree's calculations were crucial in allowing Horrocks to estimate the size of Venus and the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Unfortunately Horrocks died early in 1641 the day before he was due to meet Crabtree. Crabtree made his will on 19 July 1644, and was buried within the precincts of the Manchester Collegiate Church on 1 August 1644, close to where he had received his education. 18th century =The creation of the first economically successful canal= The pioneering Bridgewater Canal, an economically successful canal which spawned 'Canal Mania'. The Bridgewater Canal, opening in 1761 is generally regarded as the earliest successful canals. The Bridgewater Canal connects Runcorn, Manchester and Leigh, in North West England. It was commissioned by Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater, to transport coal from his mines in Worsley to Manchester. It was opened in 1761 from Worsley to Manchester, and later extended from Manchester to Runcorn, and then from Worsley to Leigh. The Duke invested a large sum of money in the scheme. From Worsley to Manchester its construction cost ¬£168,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ), but its advantages over land and river transport meant that within a year of its opening in 1761, the price of coal in Manchester fell by about half. This success helped inspire a period of intense canal building, known as Canal Mania. Along with its stone aqueduct at Barton-upon- Irwell, the Bridgewater Canal was considered a major engineering achievement. One commentator wrote that when finished, \\"[the canal] will be the most extraordinary thing in the Kingdom, if not in Europe. The boats in some places are to go underground, and in other places over a navigable river, without communicating with its waters ...\\".Boughey, Joseph. (1998) Hadfield's British Canals, Sutton Publishing Ltd, 19th century A painting by Madox Brown depicting John Dalton collecting marsh gas to help ascertain Dalton's atomic theory Various atoms and molecules as depicted in John Dalton's A New System of Chemical Philosophy (1808). John Dalton, was born in Cumberland in 1766, a promising young scientist he moved to Manchester in 1793. He hypothesised the idea of \\"colour blindness\\", a theory which was alien to all as it had not been formally talked about before. Dalton hypothesised the idea from his own experience, as he suffered from discoloured eyesight himself. Dalton would go on to propose the Dalton atomic theory in which he hypothesised that elements were made of small particles called atoms. The Manchester Liverpool Road railway station, the world's first intercity railway station Manchester Liverpool Road is a former railway station on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in Manchester, which opened on 15 September 1830. The L&MR; station was the terminus of the world's first inter-city passenger railway in which all services were hauled by timetabled steam locomotives. It is now the world's oldest surviving terminal railway station. The station closed to passenger services on 4 May 1844 when the line was extended to join the Manchester and Leeds Railway at Hunt's Bank. Liverpool Road was superseded by Manchester Victoria railway station. Since Liverpool Road ceased operation, the oldest railway station still in use is Earlestown railway station which also opened on 15 September 1830. However the station is still preserved by the Museum of Science and Industry. Robert Angus Smith, a Scottish chemist visited Manchester in the 1840s. In his research in Manchester, Smith discovered the existence of acid rain, a by product of the industrial revolution. Smith consequently pushed for greater environmental awareness and helped to found the Noxious Vapours Abatement Society in Manchester, which raised awareness of the consequences of poor air. A drawing portrait of Sir Joseph Whitworth. =Joseph Whitworth= Joseph Whitworth was an engineer and inventor who hailed from Stockport, Cheshire (now Greater Manchester). A talented mechanic amongst various other engineering roles, for long periods of his life, he worked in factories in Manchester. Whitworth would ultimately devise a standard screw thread system, the first of its kind in the world.Gilbert, K. R., & Galloway, D. F., 1978, Machine Tools. In C. Singer, et al., (Eds.), A history of technology. Oxford, Clarendon Press & Lee, S., (Ed.), 1900, Dictionary of national biography, Vol LXI. Smith Elder, London The system he created in 1841 would become known as the British Standard Whitworth. Whitworth also invented the Whitworth rifle, which was a giant leap in the development of the rifle, delivering a shooting range which far exceeded any firearm available at the time. In the American Civil War Confederate troops equipped with barrel-length three power scopes mounted on the exceptionally accurate Whitworth rifle had been known to kill Union officers at ranges of about 800 yards (731.5m), an unheard-of distance at that time.Snipers in HistoryWhitworth Rifle No. C529 Whitworth Sharpshooter Rifle Consequently, the Whitworth rifle is considered one of the earliest examples of a sniper rifle, if not the first.Artillery of the Civil War In recognition of his achievements, a number of buildings in Manchester are named after him as is Whitworth Street. As part of his bequest, the Whitworth Art Gallery was created in his honour. =John Frederick Bateman and water supply= The Manchester Ship Canal, the world's longest ship canal upon opening in 1894 By the 1850s, Manchester had grown into an industrial city, but the alacrity of such development had placed great strain on the city's infrastructure. Engineering developments such as water supplies, sewers and transport links (typically via canals) would provide Manchester with the necessary supplies to move forward. In the 1840s, the Manchester Corporation Water Works recommended that to the city corporation that an infrastructure to increase water supplies to cope with demand must be built. The obvious choice for this supply would come from areas of high rainfall and there were three choices which were close enough to Manchester. The Lake District, Peak District and Snowdonia are traditionally rainy areas with its numerous valleys, ideal for a large reservoir. This was rejected in favour of John Frederick Bateman's proposal to build a supply chain of six reservoirs in the Longdendale Valley to the east of Manchester. Further feats of engineering were required to cope with Manchester's increasing demand for water. From 1890 to 1925, the Thirlmere Aqueduct was constructed from Thirlmere to Heaton Park Reservoir. At 96 miles long, it remains the longest tunnel in the world. =Manchester Ship Canal= In the 1880s, plans for a new Manchester Ship Canal were proposed. The idea was championed by Manchester manufacturer Daniel Adamson, who arranged a meeting at his home, The Towers in Didsbury, on 27 June 1882. He invited the representatives of several Lancashire towns, local businessmen and politicians, and two civil engineers: Hamilton Fulton and Edward Leader Williams. Fulton's design was for a tidal canal, with no locks and a deepened channel into Manchester. With the city about above sea level, the docks and quays would have been well below the surrounding surface. Williams' plan was to dredge a channel between a set of retaining walls, and build a series of locks and sluices to lift incoming vessels up to Manchester. Both engineers were invited to submit their proposals, and Williams' plans were selected to form the basis of a bill to be submitted to Parliament later that year. The Manchester Ship Canal briefly became the longest ship canal in the world upon opening and at its peak in the 1960s, it was the third busiest port in Britain. =Trafford Park= The Ford Model T, the first production factory outside America for the Model T was at Trafford Park in Manchester, bolstered by it logistic benefits of the Manchester Ship Canal. As the ship canal was opened in 1894, plans were afoot for a new industrial estate, the first of its kind in the world. Two years after the opening of the ship canal, financier Ernest Terah Hooley bought the country estate belonging to Sir Humphrey Francis de Trafford for ¬£360,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Hooley intended to develop the site, which was close to Manchester and at the end of the canal, as an exclusive housing estate, screened by woods from industrial units constructed along the frontage onto the canal. With the predicted traffic for the canal slow to materialise, Hooley and Marshall Stevens (the general manager of the Ship Canal Company) came to see the benefits that the industrial development of Trafford Park could offer to both the ship canal and the estate. In January 1897 Stevens became the managing director of Trafford Park Estates, where he remained until 1930, latterly as its joint chairman and managing director. Within five years Trafford Park, Europe's largest industrial estate, was home to forty firms. The earliest structures on the canal side were grain silos; the grain was used for flour and as ballast for ships carrying raw cotton. The wooden silo built opposite No.9 Dock in 1898 (destroyed in the Manchester Blitz in 1940) was Europe's largest grain elevator. The CWS bought land on Trafford Wharf in 1903, where it opened a bacon factory and a flour mill. In 1906 it bought the Sun Mill, which it extended in 1913 to create the UK's largest flour mill, with its own wharf, elevators and silos. Inland from the canal the British Westinghouse Electric Company bought 11 per cent of the estate. Westinghouse's American architect Charles Heathcote was responsible for much of the planning and design of their factory, which built steam turbines and turbo generators. By 1899 Heathcote had also designed fifteen warehouses for the Manchester Ship Canal Company. Engineering companies such as Ford and Metropolitan-Vickers had a large presence at Trafford Park alongside non-engineering companies such Kellogg's who remain to this day. Trafford Park was also home to the first Ford production plant for their revolutionary Model T car outside of the United States. The Rolls-Royce Merlin engine, produced en masse during World War II at Ford's Trafford Park plant. During World War II, Trafford Park became an important centre for the manufacture and development in engineering in the aim of giving Britain a technological advantage over its enemies. Having an abandoned factory in Trafford Park, Ford of Britain was approached about the possibility of converting it into an aircraft engine production unit by Herbert Austin, who was in charge of the shadow factory plan. Building work on a new factory was started in May 1940 on a site, while Ford engineers went on a fact finding mission to Derby. Their chief engineer commented to Sir Stanley Hooker that the tolerances used were far too wide for them, and so the 20,000 drawings would need to be redrawn to Ford tolerance levels, which took over a year. Ford's factory was built with two distinct sections to minimise potential bomb damage, it was completed in May 1941 and bombed in the same month. At first, the factory had difficulty in attracting suitable labour, and large numbers of women, youths and untrained men had to be taken on. Despite this, the first Merlin engine came off the production line one month laterNicholls 1996, p. 103. and it was building the engine at a rate of 200 per week by 1943, at which point the joint factories were producing 18,000 Merlins per year. Ford‚Äôs investment in machinery and the redesign resulted in the 10,000 man-hours needed to produce a Merlin dropping to 2,727 in three years, while unit cost fell from ¬£6,540 in June 1941 to ¬£1,180 by the war‚Äôs end. In his autobiography Not much of an Engineer, Sir Stanley Hooker states: \\"... once the great Ford factory at Manchester started production, Merlins came out like shelling peas. The percentage of engines rejected by the Air Ministry was zero. Not one engine of the 30,400 produced was rejected ...\\".Hooker 1984, pp. 58‚Äì59. Some 17,316 people worked at the Trafford Park plant, including 7,260 women and two resident doctors and nurses. Merlin production started to run down in August 1945, and finally ceased on 23 March 1946.Nicholls 1996, p. 105. The Ship Canal is now past its heyday, but still sits at Europe's largest industrial estate, Trafford Park and there are plans to increase shipping. Its importance highlighted by the engineering achievement that was the Manchester Ship Canal, the only ship canal in Britain and growth of the first industrial estate in the world in Trafford Park. 20th century =The 'Nuclear Family'= J. J. Thomson, Manchester-born physicist who is credited with the discovery of the electron and isotopes In the late 19th and early 20th century, Manchester gained a pioneering reputation for a city at the centre of physics, namely in the field of nuclear physics. The 'Nuclear Family' was the alias given to a group of scientists who studied nuclear physics in Manchester. 'Family' highlights the consistent development through the generations in nuclear physics, beginning with Thomson in the late 18th century and ending with James Chadwick in the 1930s who discovered the neutron. Ernest Rutherford is often described as the 'father of nuclear physics', equally the same could be said of J. J. Thomson who discovered the electron and isotopes, and ultimately taught Rutherford who later go on to split the atom. Scientists who were part of the 'nuclear family' in Manchester included J. J. Thomson, Ernest Rutherford, Niels Bohr, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden, John Cockcroft and James Chadwick. J. J. Thomson, a Manchester-born physicist hailing from Cheetham Hill, who enrolled to Owens College as a 14-year-old.Davis & Falconer, J.J. Thomson and the Discovery of the Electron Thomson would go on to discover the electron in 1897 and isotope, as well as inventing the mass spectrometer. All of which, contributed to his award of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1906. Thomson also proposed the plum pudding model, which was later confirmed as scientifically incorrect by Rutherford. In 1907, Ernest Rutherford, a scientist who had been taught by Thomson at the University of Cambridge, moved to Manchester to become chair of physics at the Victoria University of Manchester. Rutherford hypothesised the Rutherford model, which was later improved on by Niels Bohr who proposed the Bohr model. Rutherford would later have a great influence on students such as Niels Bohr, Hans Geiger, Ernest Marsden and James Chadwick. Rutherford's main work would come in 1917 when he would 'split the atom'. =Aviation= Arthur Whitten Brown and Manchester-born John Alcock in 1919. From the advent of aviation at the beginning of the 20th century, Manchester has been home to a number of famous aviation companies, most notably Avro. In 1910, French aviator Louis Paulhan flew from London to Manchester in approximately 12 hours. Paulhan won the first Daily Mail aviation prizes who offered the prize in 1906. Jack Alcock was born on 5 November 1892 at Seymour Grove, Old Trafford, Stretford, England. He attended St Thomas's primary school in Heaton Chapel, Stockport. He first became interested in flying at the age of seventeen. In 1910 he became an assistant to Works Manager Charles Fletcher, an early Manchester aviatorScholefield p.212 and Norman Crossland, a motor engineer and founder of Manchester Aero Club. It was during this period that Alcock met the Frenchman Maurice Ducrocq who was both a demonstration pilot and UK sales representative for aero engines made by Spirito Mario Viale in Italy. Ducrocq took Alcock on as a mechanic at the Brooklands aerodrome, Surrey, where he learned to fly at Ducrocq's flying school, gaining his pilot's licence there in November 1912. By summer 1914 he was proficient enough to compete in a Hendon-Birmingham-Manchester and return air race, flying a Farman biplane. He landed at Trafford Park Aerodrome and flew back to Hendon the same day. Alcock became an experienced military pilot and instructor during World War I with the Royal Naval Air Service, although he was shot down during a bombing raid and taken prisoner in Turkey. After the war, Alcock wanted to continue his flying career and took up the challenge of attempting to be the first to fly directly across the Atlantic. Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown took off from St John's, Newfoundland, at 1:45 pm local time on 14 June 1919, and landed in Derrygimla bog near Clifden, Ireland, 16 hours and 12 minutes later on 15 June 1919 after flying 1,980 miles (3,186 km). The flight had been much affected by bad weather, making accurate navigation difficult; the intrepid duo also had to cope with turbulence, instrument failure and ice on the wings. The flight was made in a modified Vickers Vimy bomber, and won a ¬£10,000 prize offered by London's Daily Mail newspaper for the first non-stop flight across the Atlantic. His grave in Southern Cemetery, Manchester is marked by a large stone memorial alongside other famous Mancunian figures.Scholefield (2004) p.218 He is buried in grave space \\"Church of England, Section G, Grave Number 966\\", alongside 4 other individuals: John Alcock, Mary Alcock, Edward Samson Alcock and Elsie Moseley. In 1910, Eccles-born Alliott Verdon Roe founded Avro on at Brownsfield Mill on Great Ancoats Street in Manchester city centre. Alongside, Farnworth-born aircraft designer Roy Chadwick, Avro would go on to design some recognisable British aircraft of the 20th century. The Avro Lancaster bomber, devised for World War II was a redeveloped version of the Avro Manchester and subsequently became the most important British aircraft of the war alongside the Supermarine Spitfire. =Astronomy= The Lovell Telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory. In the 1930s, Bernard Lovell, an astronomer moved to Manchester to become a research fellow on the cosmic ray research team at the Victoria University of Manchester. He spent war time years working on developing radar systems and the like to assist in the war effort. After the war, he continued his studies in cosmic rays, but background radiation and light in the large Manchester impeded his work. He decided to push for funding for a large radio telescope which would be based away from the city on the Cheshire Plain south of Manchester at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. Funding was granted from the Nuffield Foundation with some contribution from the government, and soon an 89-metre height structure, which was the largest telescope in the world at the time of construction, was operational in 1957. The telescope became operational in October 1957, which was just before the launch of Sputnik 1, the world's first artificial satellite. Only the Soviet hierarchy were aware of Sputnik and it was the Lovell Telescope which tracked the satellite. While the transmissions from Sputnik itself could easily be picked up by a household radio, the Lovell Telescope was the only telescope capable of tracking Sputnik's booster rocket by radar; it first located it just before midnight on 12 October 1957.Lovell, Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 196Lovell, Astronomer by Chance, p. 262 It also located Sputnik 2's carrier rocket at just after midnight on 16 November 1957.Lovell, Story of Jodrell Bank, p. 197 Jodrell Bank continued tracking new artificial satellites in the following years, and also doubled up as a long range ballistic missile radar system, a beneficial trait which helped the telescope gain funding from the British government. The Jodrell Bank Observatory is currently operated by the University of Manchester and was nominated for UNESCO World Heritage Status in 2011. =Computing= Replica of the Manchester Baby, the world's first electronic stored-program computer In December 1946, Stockport-born Frederic Calland Williams returned to Manchester to head the Electrical Engineering department at the Victoria University of Manchester. Williams also recruited Tom Kilburn, with whom he worked with at the Telecommunications Research Establishment during World War II. Both worked on perfecting the cathode ray tube which Kilburn worked on. They eventually came up with the Williams tube, which allowed the storage of binary data. Consequently both worked on the Manchester Baby and on the 21 June 1948, the machine was switched on. Despite its low performance by modern standards ‚Äì the Baby only had a 32-bit word length and a memory of 32 words ‚Äì it was the first computer capable of storing data in the world and was breakthrough in the computer science world. The Baby had provided a feasible design and development began on a more, usable and practical computer in the Manchester Mark 1. Joined by Alan Turing, the university continued development and by October 1949, the Mark 1 was finished. The computer ran successfully, error-free, on the 16 and 17 June 1949. Thirty-five patents resulted from the computer and the successful implementation of an index register. =First test-tube baby= In 1978, after a decade of research by Manchester-born Robert G. Edwards and his colleague, Patrick Steptoe, Louise Brown, the world's first baby conceived by in vitro fertilisation. Louise Brown, was born at on 1978 at the Oldham General Hospital and made medical history: in vitro fertilization meant a new way to help infertile couples who formerly had no possibility of having a baby. Refinements in technology have increased pregnancy rates and it is estimated that in 2010 about children have been born by IVF with approximately 170,000 coming from donated oocyte and embryos In 2010, Robert G. Edwards was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \\"for the development of in vitro fertilization\\". 21st century =Graphene= In 2010, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov, physicists at the University of Manchester won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their work on graphene. Successfully isolated in 2004, research and development continues on the 'miracle material' today to find practical, everyday uses for the material. The following year in 2011, the British government announced ¬£50 million of funding to allow further development of graphene in the United Kingdom.

Geography It is located at about 24 km to the north of Kavaratti, 37 km to the east of Agatti and 42.5 km to the SSW of Amini Island. The island is low and arid and, lacking adequate anchorage points, of difficult accessibility. There is another island with the same name in Lakshadweep which is part of the Kalpeni Atoll. The Island is 300 x 200 m in size and devoid of vegetation. There is a dark rock on the eastern side and several stone cairns. Ecology Pakshipitti is an important nesting place for pelagic birds such as the sooty tern (Sterna fuliginosa), the greater crested tern (Sterna bergii) and the brown noddy (Anous stolidus). The birds nest side by side, but not intermixed, on the dry coral rubble. There is a seasonal pattern in the breeding period of the birds. Since it has no protecting reef surrounding it, the islet is periodically rinsed by wave action and there is no accumulation of guano on it. Paksipitti Bank Is located at the southern end of Pakshipitti Bank, a largely submerged atoll, on the same bank as Amini Island. The Bank, also oriented along a northeast-southwest axis, is 49 km long, in the northern part from 2 to 7 km wide and in the southern part up to 18 km wide. The 11th parallel north passes across the bank. Pitti Bank may be considered a largely submerged and sunken atoll, with an estimated lagoon area of , with just the two islands Amini and Paksipitti remaining at its opposite ends. Administration The island belongs to the township of Kavaratti Island of Kavaratti Tehsil.

An AOTU provides the co-ordination of the urban public transport network within its area, known as the ' (PTU; urban transport perimeter). To do so it receives funds raised via a transport tax on local businesses called the versement transport (VT). There are several types of legal structure which these organisations by which AOTUs may be governed Traditionally, urban public transport was organised by the French communes, especially in the south of France. In 1999, commune-based organisations represented over 30% of all AOTUs. Since the 1970s, however, AOTs have tended to combine across communes, with the creation of numerous ' (SIVUs; inter-commune single-purpose syndicates) with a remit only for the direction of urban transport. Between the end of the 1970s and 1999, 20% to 30% of AOTUs were SIVUs. In 2004, some years after the adoption of the 1999 ' (law for the improvement and simplification of inter-communal cooperation), usually known as the ', the most common structure for AOTUs were as ' (agglomeration communities), at 43% of the total, with ' (communities of communes) making up 12% and (urban communities) making up 5% of all AOTUs. Additionally, mixed syndicates represented 12% of the total in 2004, when SIVUs (8%) and ' (SIVOMs; inter-commune multi-purpose syndicates) (1%) were being phased out. By 2004, 18% of all AOTUs were communes. An AOTU can run the transport service itself (a ') or contract it out to another transport operator. Contractual relations between the AOTU and the contractor can also take many different forms: for example as a ' or a '.

Malko, im Auftrag des Pentagon) is a French-German film adaptation of G√©rard de Villiers' novel of the same name. The film was directed by Raoul Coutard. It starred Miles O'Keeffe as Son Altesse S√©r√©nissime Malko, the debonair polyglot hero of a long-lived (1965-2013) series of altogether 200 spy novels. Plot Like in the books Malko is a nobleman whose family bequeathed him a huge castle and an aristocratic appearance but no sufficient means to sustain the inherited premises or to keep up the appropriate life style. This time it is the castle's roof that requires work and forces Malko to accept another CIA mission. The secret service is worried about rumours which endanger the US- American reputation. It was brought to the CIA's notice that a former collaborator named Enrique Chacon (Raimund Harmstorff) allegedly went rogue in San Salvador. Malko is supposed to investigate Chacon over the atrocities of death squads and then do whatever seems fit against the background of his findings. So he travels to San Salvador and goes about it. Soon he becomes a witness to the crimes of the death squads and eventually he has to realise how Chacon is indeed the driving force for all that. That leaves him no other choice than to render Chacon harmless for good before he can return to his castle and his fianc√©e, Countess Alexandra (Sybil Danning). Background In 1983 spy films were so popular that there were two James Bond films released the very same year ‚Äì Never Say Never Again (starring Sean Connery) and Octopussy (starring Roger Moore) ‚Äì while George Lazenby played \\"J.B.\\" in Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E. made for television movie. Neither Bond film was convincingly realistic or absolutely true to author Ian Fleming who had once created this hero. The lasting success of novels about Malko showed there was a market for adventures of a newer and younger gentleman spy who refrained from spectacular gadgets. Moreover, Malko's creator G√©rard de Villiers would ostentatiously write the script and be one of the producers for all to see that this film was in accordance with his novels. Despite all good intentions S.A.S. √† San Salvador didn't establish a new series of spy films but the series of novels lived on all the same, and one-time \\"Malko\\" Miles O'Keeffe starred the very next year with Sean Connery in Sword of the Valiant.

An early owner of the house, and possibly its builder, was the Welsh Quaker settler, Edward Morgan, the maternal grandfather of Daniel Boone. Despite Morgan's Welsh heritage, the house is built in a medieval Germanic style. It is located at 850 Weikel Rd. in Towamencin Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. History Six- hundred acres, including the house site, was granted by the Commissioners of William Penn to Griffith Jones, a merchant, on February 12, 1702. Edward Morgan bought 309 acres of that land on February 26, 1708. An unspecified \\"dwelling house\\" was part of the purchase, though Morgan appears to have been the first settler to live on the property. Morgan came to Pennsylvania in 1698 and settled north of the area's main Welsh settlement in Gwynedd. In 1720 his daughter Sarah married Squire Boone, and ten years later, the couple moved to Berks County, where Daniel Boone was born in 1734. Other descendants of Edward Morgan include Daniel Morgan, Lowell Thomas, and Walter L. Morgan. In 1723, Edward Morgan deeded 104 acres, including the house, to his son John Morgan, who sold the property to Evan David in 1741. John Yeakel, a Schwenkfelder, bought the property in 1770 and then sold 82 acres to Yellis Cassel, a Mennonite, in 1774. The property stayed in the Cassel family for 99 years until Frederick Bower bought the house along with 62 acres. After several other owners, William Nash bought the house and 17 acres in 1965, and planned to develop and subdivide the land. The house was condemned in 1967, but was recognized as a historic structure the same year and an organization was formed to save it from demolition. Towamencin Township bought the house along with 1.7 acres in 1970. The Welsh Valley Preservation Society now operates tours of the Morgan Log House. Architecture The house has two-and-a-half stories, with a center chimney. It was constructed of white oak logs with notched corners and chinked with diagonally placed stones. A pent roof runs around three sides of the house, and the gable ends were covered in vertical sheathing. The original interior is well preserved, including original hand wrought hardware and a large central fireplace.Mary E.

In 1954, these formations were dissolved to create a single 90-place band attached to the second 3rd Legion, which had a long history until 1989, when it disappeared, becoming the band of the Military Government of Ceuta.https://www.defensa.gob.es/portaldecultura/cultural/musica/andalucia/musica_182.html Commanders *Colonel Pedro Mar√≠a Andreu Gallardo (15 October 1995 ‚Äì 15 October 1997) *Colonel Manuel Juli√°n Garc√≠a Moreno (15 October 1997 ‚Äì 15 October 1999) *Colonel Francisco Manuel Morala Albadalejo (15 October 1999 ‚Äì 19 December 2001) *Colonel Vicente Bataller Alventosa 19 December 2001 ‚Äì 20 December 2003) *Colonel Adolfo Orozco L√≥pez (20 December 2003 ‚Äì 19 December 2005) *Colonel Jos√© Antonio Alonso Miranda (20 December 2006-December 2007) *Colonel Pedro Perez Garcia (December 2007-December 2009) *Colonel Jose Rodr√≠guez Garc√≠a (December 2009 ‚Äì Present) Gallery File:Coat of Arms of the Spanish Legion Band.svgCoat of Arms of the Spanish Legion Band.

It was created by and named for Ana T. Forrest in 1982. It is known for \\"its long holding of positions, emphasis on abdominal core work, and standing series that can go on for 20 poses on each side\\". Reputed for its intensity, the style emphasizes connecting to one's feelings in order to work through physical and emotional trauma. Description Ana Forrest derived her practice from some aspects of Sivananda yoga, along with attention to alignment and use of props found in Iyengar yoga, and the heat and flowing sequences of Ashtanga vinyasa yoga. As the style evolved, she created a number of additional poses and sequences adapted to modern society, such as wrist stretches to prevent and relieve carpal tunnel syndrome. She also created shoulder shrugs to relieve tension and loosen the upper back, abdominal exercises to tone internal organs and strengthen the lower back, and some poses using a folded over and rolled up yoga mat. Forrest personally practices aspects of Hatha yoga not widely taught in modern yoga as exercise; her skill at the shatkarma nauli is featured on the Nauli.org site. Forrest Yoga classes are conducted in a warm room () and begin with pranayama, then move through seated poses and abdominal muscle exercises before arriving at the \\"hot part\\" of the class that might involve sun salutations, standing poses, inversions, backbends and other asanas that build up to the more challenging \\"apex\\" poses. The poses are sustained, intensively and contemplatively, sometimes for 10 deep breaths, sometimes for several minutes. Philosophy Forrest Yoga's vision and mission, inspired by the life of Black Elk, a healer and Medicine Man of the Oglala Lakota Sioux, is \\"to mend the rainbow hoop of the people\\". Smith, Eva Norlyk, \\"Creating Embodiment: An Interview with Ana Forrest\\", Huffington Post, February 12, 2015, In this style, healing is meant to extend to the emotional body, directing the breath into affected parts of the body to release emotions.Steffensen, Sharon, \\"Ana Forrest: Mending the Hoop of the People\\", Yoga Chicago, November/December 2003, p. 12 Forrest was certified as a yoga teacher when aged 18. She is trained in Native American medicine, reiki, and regression therapy. She has studied alternative healing techniques including homeopathy, naturopathy, reflexology, shiatsu, and chiropractic, all of which, she states, inform her work. The style claims to be founded on four principles, or \\"pillars\\": # Breath, to help connect in feeling with one's body and ignite passion for living # Strength, via intense core sequences and long holds of poses that generate heat and heighten the senses # Integrity, in working with the edges of one's practice, particularly around physical and emotional injuries, developing tools to deal with fear and struggle # Spirit, to create a sense of freedom and \\"courage to walk as your Spirit dictates\\" Basic Moves Forrest Yoga's physical practice uses some \\"basic moves\\" in every pose up until Savasana.\\"Yoga for Healing,\\" by Melissa B.Williams, Fit Yoga, February, 2006, p.22 Many of these moves resemble those practiced in other yoga styles, such as Ujjayi breath and tucking the tailbone, while others are unique to this style, particularly the practice of relaxing the neck and wrapping the shoulders. Overall emphasis is on breath work and core strengthening. # Active Hands and Feet, spreading the hand bones wide and extending the fingers fully, and pressing through heels and balls of feet and lifting the toesAna Forrest, \\"Choosing Healing is the Ultimate Warrior Action\\", Origin Magazine, December/January 2012, pp. 22‚Äì23 # Tuck Tailbone, to lengthen tailbone downward and relieve pressure on the lower back # Telescope Ribs, placing hands on lower part of rib cage and inhaling to lift ribcage away from belly # Expand Ribs # Wrap Shoulders # Relax Neck # Deep breathing\\"Healing PTSD Through a New Kind of Yoga\\", by Ana Forrest, Huffington Post, May 15, 2011 Another part of Forrest Yoga practice is development of feeling connections between one part of the body and another.

International Unemployment Day (March 6, 1930) was a coordinated international campaign of marches and demonstrations, marked by hundreds of thousands of people in major cities around the world taking to the streets to protest mass unemployment associated with the Great Depression. The Unemployment Day marches, organized by the Communist International and coordinated by its various member parties, resulted in two deaths of protestors in Berlin, injuries at events in Vienna and the Basque city of Bilbao, and less violent outcomes in London and Sydney. In the United States, full-scale riots erupted in New York City and Detroit when thousands of baton-wielding police attacked tens of thousands of marchers. A total of 30 American cities in all saw mass demonstrations as part of the March 6 campaign, including Boston, Milwaukee, Baltimore, Cleveland, Washington, DC, San Francisco, and Seattle. History =Conception of the event= By 1930, the economic boom of the 1920s was a mere memory, replaced by a stock market crash and severe contraction of the interlocked capitalist economies of the world. Unemployment became a mass phenomenon, and social services for those affected were minimal. The Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) in Moscow was preoccupied with the worsening economic crisis from its outset, and identified escalating unemployment as capitalism's potentially most inflammatory flaw.E.H. Carr, Twilight of the Comintern, 1930‚Äì1935. New York: Pantheon Books, 1982; pg. 9. A proposal was made in ECCI to establish March 6, 1930, as an \\"international day\\" of protest against unemployment, a decision taken at ECCI's session of January 16. The campaign was further developed by a conference of representatives of Communist parties held in Berlin on January 31, held under the auspices of the West European Bureau of the Comintern. The coordinated events were initially scheduled for February 26, 1930. It was soon deemed that this early date did not allow sufficient time for preparation, however, and on or about February 17 it was announced in the Communist press around the world that the Executive Committee of the Comintern had postponed International Unemployment Day ‚Äî moving the event back eight days to March 6.\\"World Unemployment Day Advanced to March 6,\\" Daily Worker [New York], vol. 6, no. 296 (Feb. 17, 1930), pg. 1. This change of date was not without its lasting embarrassments, however, as in the United States the Communist Party's monthly theoretical magazine had been put into the mail with an incorrect date on the cover. In Moscow, Comintern head Dmitry Manuilsky reiterated the need for the member parties of the Communist International to exert themselves in conjunction with the International Unemployment Day campaign. In his main report to the \\"Enlarged Presidium\\" of ECCI in February, in which he declared that the forthcoming March 6 demonstrations would enable workers to protest against the ruling class's efforts to \\"shuffle off all the consequences of the ripening world economic crisis on their shoulders\\".Quoted in Carr, Twilight of the Comintern, pg. 9. Manuilsky's report identified the United States as the center of the world economic crisis and pegged American unemployment at 6 million.Carr, Twilight of the Comintern, pg. 10. Germany, said to be \\"only beginning\\" to be swept up in the economic cataclysm, was said to have 3.5 million unemployed workers, joined by 2 million more in Great Britain. In all, the Comintern estimated that there were 17 million unemployed workers in the primary capitalist countries, with 60 million (including family members) severely impacted. This it believed to be tinder with which a blaze could be alighted. =Events in North America= The Communist Party USA (CPUSA) prepared for the March 6 actions with agitational meetings and leaflets, over 1 million of which were circulated in anticipation of the event.William Z. Foster, History of the Communist Party of the United States. New York: International Publishers, 1952; pg. 281. The party made use of two primary mobilizing slogans to motivate participation and to generate enthusiasm for the event: \\"Work or Wages!\\" and \\"Don't Starve ‚Äî Fight!\\"Foster, History of the Communist Party of the United States, pg. 282. The demonstrations were to be conducted under the auspices of the party's trade union adjunct, the Trade Union Unity League (TUUL). New York City Three top leaders of the American Communist Party were arrested and served six-month jail terms in conjunction with the New York events:William Z. Foster, Robert Minor, and Israel Amter. In the estimation of historian Harvey Klehr, the March 6 demonstrations in the United States surpassed every expectation held for them by the CPUSAHarvey Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade. New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 33. In New York City, the Communists later asserted that 110,000 turned out, although the staid New York Times claimed the much lower figure of 35,000 instead. A huge throng assembled in Union Square to be addressed by Sam Darcy, a primary organizer of the New York event. During hasty negotiations with CPUSA leader William Z. Foster, New York City Police Commissioner Grover Whalen refused to allow a procession of the Union Square gathering to city hall on the grounds that no parade permit had been obtained. Foster took to the rostrum to inform the crowd that the right to march was being denied and demanded of the gathering, \\"Will you take that for an answer?\\"Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pp. 33‚Äì34. The crowd vehemently responded in the negative, and Foster immediately began leading an impromptu march down Broadway to City Hall.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 34. That was taken by police as a provocation, and 1,000 officers launched into the procession, touching off 15 min of bitter street fighting. The New York Times said of the scene: > Hundreds of policemen and detectives, swinging nightsticks, blackjacks, and > bare fists, rushed into the crowd, hitting out at all with whom they came > into contract, chasing many across the street and into adjacent > thoroughfares and pushing hundreds off their feet. From all parts of the > scene of battle came the screams of women and cries of men with bloody heads > and faces. Firemen turned hoses onto the crowd and a police truck equipped with tear gas, submachine guns, and riot guns was driven to the scene. Foster was arrested together with Communist Party leaders Robert Minor, and Israel Amter on the steps of City Hall. The group ultimately received sentences and served six months in jail for their participation in the suppressed march. Detroit New York was not the only American city to see International Unemployment Day violence. In Detroit, more than 100,000 turned out, according to the Communist Party.\\"Over 100,000 Detroit Workers Struggle With Police; 2 Hours: Police Cannot Disperse Biggest Demonstration in History of Detroit,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 6, no. 312 (March 7, 1930), pp. 1, 3. A peaceful demonstration gave way to a pitched two-hour battle between 25,000 demonstrators and 3,000 police wielding clubs, some of whom trampled the crowd with horses, according to the official Communist account. Twenty-six people were hospitalized as a result of the violence, including one policeman, and more than two dozen protestors were arrested. This depiction of events was challenged by others. William Miller of the rival Communist Party (Majority Group), headed by Jay Lovestone, asserted that about 30,000 workers had answered the call to demonstrate on March 6, joined for a brief time by about 45,000 downtown employees off during lunch hour.William Miller, \\"March 6 in Detroit,\\" Revolutionary Age [New York], vol. 1, no. 12 (April 21, 1930), pg. 10. While the gathering had been \\"splendid\\" as a spontaneous protest of unemployed workers, \\"as an organized demonstration it was a fiasco,\\" Miller asserted, noting that the space where the gathering was scheduled was inadequate and that no platform had been constructed so that party leaders were unable to address the assembled crowd. Moreover, Miller notes, CPUSA District Organizer Jack Stachel had gone into hiding two days before the event and did not even witness the purported incidents about which he so breathlessly wired the Daily Worker. Chicago In Chicago some 50,000 turned out to cap 10 days of radical protests and police repression.\\"Two Mile Long Chicago March: 50,000, Undaunted by Terror, Demonstrate,\\" Daily Worker,\\" vol. 6, no. 313 (March 8, 1930), pg. 1. Over 150 arrests had already been made by Chicago police during the first week of March, the headquarters of the Communist Party was raided and wrecked not once but twice, as were offices of the International Labor Defense, the Trade Union Unity League, Workers International Relief, the Communist Lithuanian-language newspaper Vilnis, and a Russian cooperative store. Despite the climate of fear, an estimated 50,000 turned out for the International Unemployment Day protest, marching through the streets 12 abreast for about four hours. The demonstration concluded with a large open air meeting at the Chicago stockyards, addressed by CPUSA district organizer Clarence Hathaway, TUUL organizer Nels Kjar, and representatives of the Young Communist League and black workers. Other cities The cover of the February 1930 issue of the CPUSA's theoretical magazine ran with a cancelled earlier date for the International Unemployment Day demonstrations. Less tumultuous demonstrations were held Boston, with the CPUSA claiming that as many as 50,000 turning out, and Milwaukee, which was said to have included 40,000. Additionally, 50,000 demonstrators were claimed for the event in Pittsburgh, 30,000 in Philadelphia, 25,000 in Cleveland, and about 20,000 in Youngstown. According to the CPUSA press an additional 15,000 assembled at LaFayette Square in Buffalo, New York,\\"15,000 Strong in Buffalo Meet,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 6, no. 312 (March 7, 1930), pg. 1. a like number in Canton, Ohio,\\"15,000 Out at Canton, Ohio,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 6, no. 312 (March 7, 1930), pg. 1. while 10,000 marched in Washington, DC.\\"10,000 March in Washington, DC,\\" Daily Worker, vol. 6, no. 312 (March 7, 1930), pg. 1. Substantial demonstrations were also held in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Denver, Baltimore, and other large cities. All told, more than 30 American cities were the site of protests and marches on March 6.Vivian McGuckin Raineri, The Red Angel: The Life and Times of Elaine Black Yoneda. New York: International Publishers, 1991; pg. 23. In all the CPUSA claimed that more than 1.25 million workers \\"demonstrated on the streets in face of the police terror and poisonous propaganda of the American Federation of Labor and Socialist Party\\".Alexander Bittelman, \\"Notes of the Month,\\" The Communist [New York], vol. 9, no. 4 (April 1930), pg. 291. The Communists claimed the event was a success in raising awareness of the problem of mass unemployment in America as well as placing themselves in a position of authority among those so affected: > Only two days prior to March 6, American capitalism refused to recognize > that there is unemployment in the United States; but the determination of > the masses to struggle under the political leadership of the Communist Party > and the revolutionary trade unions force the Hoover administration and > Secretary of Labor Davis to recognize that there are at least three million > unemployed workers in the United States. ... While the unemployed workers > were mobilized on economic demands to fight for work or wages, yet the > Communist Party and the revolutionary trade unions did not fail to point out > that unemployment cannot be abolished under capitalism and only the > destruction of capitalist state and the abolition of capitalism can solve > the unemployment problem. It is precisely this political turn of the > unemployment movement that American capitalism fears. The press of the rival Communist Party (Majority Group) charged that the CPUSA's attendance estimates were substantially inflated. The CPMG offered that rather than 50,000 participants in Chicago, an estimate of 5,000 was closer to the truth, while in New York City instead of 110,000 demonstrators there were more like 50,000, of which \\"the greatest number were bystanders, not participants.\\"\\"The March 6 Demonstrations,\\" Revolutionary Age [New York], vol. 1, no. 11 (April 7, 1930), pg. 10. Even more serious exaggeration was said to have applied in the case of Philadelphia, in which \\"less than 300 by careful count\\" actually marched to CP headquarters. Events in Wilkes-Barre (29 participants, of whom 6 were arrested) and New Bedford (150 in attendance, 50 actually marching) were held up as examples of CPUSA organizational failure. Excluding those arrested on in events leading up to the March 6 demonstrations, a total of about 250 people were arrested in the various International Unemployment Day demonstrations in the United States.J. Louis Engdahl, \\"Defeat This 'Vengeance,'\\" Labor Defender [New York], vol. 5, no. 4 (April 1930), pp. 63‚Äì64. These included 60 arrests in Los Angeles, 45 in Detroit, 36 in Milwaukee, 30 in New York City, 15 in Pittsburgh, 13 in Washington, DC, and 12 in Buffalo. While demonstrations were largest and arrests most numerous in the Northeastern United States and Upper Midwest region, other demonstrations and arrests took place in the country's more conservative Southern region, including 7 arrests in Chattanooga, 3 in New Orleans, and 2 in Atlanta. =Events in Europe= The coordinated demonstrations of March 6 were urged on with banner headlines in the Communist press. In Europe, the largest and most violent International Unemployment Day demonstrations took place in Germany, home to the largest Communist Party outside of the Soviet Union. In Berlin a decree was issued banning all street demonstrations, which was widely ignored.\\"World Jobless Demonstrations in All Capitalist Lands Fight for Demands, Against Bosses: Workers, Jobless Clash in Berlin, London, Dublin, Manchester, Vienna, Halle, Hamburg, Munich, Bucharest, and Elsewhere,\\" Daily Worker [New York], vol. 6, no. 312 (March 7, 1930), pp. 1, 3. Police violently dispersed these gatherings as they developed, making uses of clubs and gunfire. Battles between police and strikers raged into the evening, with law enforcement authorities making use of trucks with searchlights. Other significant German clashes between demonstrators and police took place in the cities of Halle, Hamburg, and Munich. Press reports on the day of the event indicated that two marchers were killed in the Halle protest. In Vienna, about 2500 marchers fought in the streets with police and young members of the fascist movement. A number of people were injured, and seven arrests made as a result of the violence. In London, four processions of marchers converged on Tower Hill to hear speeches by Tom Mann and Jack Gallagher. One group of demonstrators who attempted to march on the Mansion House against police instructions met with police resistance, with several marchers and one policeman injured in the battle which followed. The London demonstration lasted for well over four hours. A major demonstration also took place in the industrial city of Manchester, in which thousands of workers marched on the city's labor exchange. Turnout in Paris was modest, with demonstrations banned, and only about 2500 protestors willing to challenge the large force of police and soldiers positioned to keep order. French authorities made use of clubs on a group of marchers attempting to push through a police line. Several thousand marchers, primarily building trades workers, turned out in the Spanish city of Seville. = Aftermath = The Executive Committee of the Communist International was not impressed by the International Unemployment Day demonstrations, claiming that a \\"comparatively small number of the unemployed\\" had actually taken part and that united front efforts to build political bridges between workers and the unemployed as well as between the various political organizations had been inadequate.Carr, Twilight of the Comintern, pp. 38‚Äì39. The CPUSA was singled out for special criticism at the 11th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI in March 1931, with Osip Piatnitsky mocking the slogans used by the American Party, declaring of the slogan \\"Work or Wages\\" that \\"if I were unemployed and in America, I should not have understood this slogan.\\" It similarly expressed disdain for the slogan \\"Don't Starve ‚Äî Fight!\\" as ineffective.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 54. The CPUSA was much more upbeat in their assessment of the events, claiming that the March 6 demonstrations was an impetus to thousands of new members joining the organization, with an article in the group's monthly theoretical magazine claiming that a total of 6,167 new recruits had entered party ranks between March 6 and May Day, 1930.Moissaye J. Olgin, \\"From March Sixth to May First.\\" The Communist [New York], vol. 9, no. 5 (May 1930), pg. 419. It also helped boost the Communist Party into the public consciousness as \\"a recognized power, a major American political factor,\\" the party proudly proclaimed. The International Unemployment Day march in New York City led to the cashiering of one of the CPUSA's enemies, Police Commissioner Whalen, who came under fire for the brutal police handling of the otherwise peaceful demonstration and was forced to resign. Still, the gains of International Unemployment Day for the American Communists proved ephemeral, as follow up demonstrations on May Day and August 1, 1930 proved much smaller.Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pp. 34‚Äì35. Historian Harvey Klehr has noted that already by the end of April \\"there were rueful admissions that the March 6 success was due less to Communist capture of the masses than to the spontaneous outpouring of hundreds of thousands of workers with no other outlet for expressing their feelings.\\"Klehr, The Heyday of American Communism, pg. 35. Moreover, there was also a reaction. At 10:00 am on June 9, 1930, a new \\"Special Committee to Investigate Communist Activities in the United States\\" was called to order by the U.S. House of Representatives for the first time.Investigation of Communist Propaganda: Hearings before a Special Committee to Investigate Communist Activities in the United States of the House of Representatives, Seventy-First Congress, Second Session, Pursuant to H. Res. 220 Providing for an Investigation of Communist Propaganda in the United States. Part 1 ‚Äî Volume No. 1: June 9 and 13, 1930. Washington: US Government Printing Office, 1930; pg. 1. This committee, remembered to history as the Fish Committee in recognition of its chairman, Hamilton Fish III of New York, was established by Congress on May 22, just eleven weeks after the mass demonstrations of March 6. The Fish Committee would eventually call scores of witnesses and publish hundreds of pages of testimony in its ongoing mission \\"to investigate Communist propaganda in the United States\\" and the activities and membership of the Communist Party and the place of the Communist International in America. The 1930 Fish Committee would prove to be the institutional forerunner of the House Un-American Activities Committee, established in 1938.

The museum is dedicated to the oeuvre of the sculptor Rudolph Tegner (1873‚Äì1950). The museum exhibits some 250 of Tegner's sculptures as well as models in plaster, clay, bronze and marble. The surrounding terrain features 14 of his statues. History Rudolph Tegner acquired the central portion of the area in 1916. He initially mounted the group sculpture King Oedipus and Antigone and later, in 1924, followed the group sculpture The Enigma of Lone and then several others. The museum building was built to Tegner's own design with the assistance of the architect Mogens Lassen (1901-1987). Construction began in 1937 and it was inaugurated in 1938. A renovation was completed in 2003. Architecture Peeking through the entrance to the museum The museum is built in concrete to an unusual bunker-like Modernist design. The building needed large dimensions to embrace Tegner's works many of which are of very large proportions. The core of the museum is a large octagonal gallery with ceilings 11 metres high. The original intention was to build lower galleries on all of its sides but for economic reasons only two of these galleries were built, leaving three out of eight of the core sides unbound. The museum has been built without picture windows to avoid distracting the visitor with views of the scenic surroundings. Except for a small window in the gable, all natural light comes from skylights. Concrete as a material was chosen for reasons of fire safety. The difference in scale between the entrance section and the main gallery is designed to create an overwhelming experience for those entering the museum and to enhance its character of a treasury. The facade bears reference to Antique architecture. Sculpture park Sculpture park with the museum building in the background The Rudolph Tegner Museum and Statue Park is run and is owned by a private grant founded by Rudolph and Elna Tegner. The site which Tegner later ceded to the Danish State originally covered some 17 hectares of land in the core of an area known as Rusland, the Danish name for Russia. It consists of undulating heath with scattered trees and juniper vegetation.

Taxonomy Over fifty species worldwide have been placed in (sub)genus Megastomia Monterosato, 1884 by a number of authors (e.g. Saurin, 1959, 1962; Pe√±as & Rol√°n, 1999; Giannuzzi-Savelli et al. (2014). On the basis of 16s mtDNA sequence data, Schander et al. (2003) distinguished, and placed in Megastomia, two species (M. conoidea (Brocchi, 1814) and M. corimbensis (Schander, 1994)), which clustered separately from other species placed in Odostomia Fleming, 1813. However H√∏is√¶ter (2014: 34) correctly pointed out that the type species Odostomia conspicua Alder, 1850 \\"is a typical Odostomia s.s. and has few traits in common with O. conoidea\\". Considering the large number of species involved, and considering that for most of these species Odostomia is probably not more appropriate, the published combinations with Megastomia are nevertheless retained by the database WoRMS as \\"accepted\\" until more data become available.

The organization was founded in 2011 by Linux kernel developer and open source advocate Valerie Aurora and open source developer and advocate Mary Gardiner (the founder of AussieChix, the largest organization for women in open source in Australia). It was named after Ada Lovelace, who is often celebrated as the world's first computer programmer, as is the Ada programming language. In August 2015, the Ada Initiative board announced that the organization would shut down in October 2015. According to the announcement, the Initiative's executive leadership decided to step down, and the organization was unable to find acceptable replacement leaders.Announcing the shutdown of the Ada Initiative August 2015 History Ada Lovelace, a woodcut graphic by Colin Adams based on the original watercolor by Alfred Edward Chalon Valerie Aurora, already an activist for women in open source, joined Mary Gardiner and members of Geek Feminism to develop anti-harassment policies for conferences after Noirin Shirley was sexually assaulted at ApacheCon 2010. Aurora quit her job as a Linux kernel developer at Red Hat and, with Gardiner, founded the Ada Initiative in February 2011. In 2014, Valerie Aurora announced her intent to step down as executive director of the Ada Initiative, and an executive search committee was formed to find her replacement. Mary Gardiner, deputy executive director, chose not to be a candidate. The committee, headed by Sumana Harihareswara and Mary Gardiner, announced in March 2015 that the Ada Initiative had hired Crystal Huff as the new executive director.Welcoming Crystal Huff as the new Executive Director of the Ada Initiative March 2015, Ada Initiative, Adainitiative.org Huff, formerly of Luminoso in Boston, continued to work from Massachusetts in her new role. In August 2015, the Ada Initiative announced that the organization would close in mid-October, 2015. The announcement described the leadership challenge facing the Initiative: neither co-founder intended to continue as Executive Director. According to the post on the Ada Initiative website: > \\"We felt the likelihood of finding a new ED who could effectively fit into > Valerie‚Äôs shoes was low. We also considered several other options for > continuing the organization, including changing its programs, or becoming > volunteer-only. After much deliberation, the board decided to do an orderly > shutdown of the Ada Initiative, in which the organization would open source > all of our remaining knowledge and expertise in freely reusable and > modifiable form. We don‚Äôt feel like non-profits need to exist forever. The > Ada Initiative did a lot of great work, and we are happy about it.\\" The previous hire of Crystal Huff, announced several months earlier, was not mentioned other than to note \\"that hire didn't work out.\\" Administration All services provided by the Ada Initiative were pro bono, and the organization was supported by member donations. In the summer of 2011, the Ada Initiative launched a campaign to raise start-up funds with a goal of contributions from 100 funders. The campaign wrapped up six days before its planned deadline. The organization's first major sponsor was Linux Australia, who provided support alongside Puppet Labs, DreamHost, The Mail Archive and Google. Aurora and Gardiner were the only staff members, serving full-time roles in the organization. =Board and advisory board= The Ada Initiative was governed by a seven-person board of directors, who oversaw its management. The board included co-founder Mary Gardiner, Sue Gardner, Amelia Greenhall, Rachel Chalmers, Alicia Gibb, Andrea Horbinski and Marina Zhurakhinskaya.List of directors adainitiative.org, August 2015 An advisory board of about 30 members provided input about ideas and projects. Initiatives Logo of AdaCamp, the unconference for women in open stuff In collaboration with members of LinuxChix, Geek Feminism and other groups, the Ada Initiative developed anti-harassment policies for conferences. The Ada Initiative also worked with open source conference organizers to adopt, create and communicate policies to make conferences safer and more inviting for all attendees, particularly women. Conferences such as Ubuntu Developer Summits and all Linux Foundation events, including LinuxCon, have adopted policies based on the Ada Initiative's work. The Ada Initiative developed policy framework for creating a Women in Open Source Scholarship and programming guides for outreach projects and events. The organization also hosted workshops and training. These workshops and programs consisted of Allies Workshops for male and institutional supporters and \\"First Patch Week\\" programs, which encourages women's participation in Free and open source software (FOSS) through mentoring. The workshop framework is freely available, although the Ada Initiative also offered facilitators to conduct the workshops in person. By encouraging women's participation in open source culture, the Ada Initiative encouraged women to engage in open source professionally and full-time- not just as volunteers. The organization also researched women's roles and experiences in open source, focusing on bringing research up to date; the last survey done of the gender balance in open source had been completed in 2006. Research methodology and a new survey were produced in 2011. A repeat of the survey took place in 2013, with hopes to provide a standard resource for the industry. The 2011 survey invited participants of any gender and inquired about subjects regarding open source and free software, hardware, open mapping, and other related open source areas, as well as free culture such as Creative Commons, online activism, mashup, maker, hacker spaces and related communities. The Ada Initiative was the organizer of AdaCamp, an unconference \\"dedicated to increasing women‚Äôs participation in open technology and culture.\\" Seven AdaCamps were held between 2012 and 2015. Violet Blue's security presentation In February 2013, the organizers of the Security B-Sides San Francisco conference canceled speaker Violet Blue's talk, sex +/- drugs: known vulns and exploits. due to concerns raised by the Ada Initiative that it contained rape triggers, as well as the Ada Initiative's consideration of the subject as off-topic for a security conference. The abrupt cancellation provoked intense discussion in the information security industry. Since the event at B-Sides SF, lead organizer Ian Fung has outlined his account of the interactions between Blue, Aurora, and the Ada Initiative on the B-Sides SF front page, contradicting some of the claims made by both the Ada Initiative and Blue.
