The company was owned by Allen R. Glick, a San Diego real estate investor. The name Argent came from the three initials of his name, combined with the first three letters of the word \\"Enterprises\\". Over a few years, federal, state and local gaming officials in Nevada confirmed that these casinos were controlled by organized crime families in the Mid-West and that a huge skimming operation was conducted within the casinos. Argent Corp. purchased the Hacienda in 1974 and obtained a Nevada gaming license. Argent then purchased the Recrion Corporation, which owned the Stardust and Fremont. The purchase was financed by a loan from the Teamsters Central States Pension Fund. After Argent purchased the Stardust, Frank Rosenthal was installed as a manager, although he did not have a Nevada gaming license. The Nevada Gaming Commission refused to license Rosenthal because of his past criminal convictions, and Rosenthal began changing job titles to positions that did not require state licensing. Rosenthal's story was fictionalized in the movie, Casino, where he is played by Robert De Niro. During the time that Argent owned the four casinos, between $7 million and $15 million is estimated to have been skimmed from the casinos and sent to organized crime members in Chicago, Milwaukee and Kansas City. Argent was forced out of the casino industry in the late 1970s. Glick denied any wrongdoing and was never charged with a crime. He became a cooperating witness, immunized from prosecution in a criminal case in 1983 against 15 individuals charged in the skimming operation. The 15 individuals indicted included many people in the top echelon of organized crime: Joseph Aiuppa, Jackie Cerone, Joseph Lombardo and Anthony Spilotro from the Chicago Outfit; Frank Balistrieri and his two sons from the Milwaukee crime family; and Carl Civella from the Kansas City crime family.Skimming the Las Vegas Casinos – Part I by Dennis GriffinSkimming the Las Vegas Casinos – Part II by Dennis Griffin In 1975, two people with business connections to Allen Glick were shot and killed. Tamara Rand lent $500,000 to Glick to help fund his purchase of the Recrion Corporation. She later claimed that this entitled her to a 5% ownership share in Argent Corp.

Biography  Born to Tuscan parents, Fausto Cercignani studied in Milan, where he graduated in foreign languages and literatures with a dissertation dealing with English at Shakespeare’s time. His career as a university professor was at first characterized by philological investigations in the fields of English studies and Germanic studies. In 1983, after teaching at the Universities of Bergamo (1971-1974), Parma (1974-1975), and Pisa (1975-1983), he returned to Milan and carried on his activity at the University of Milan, where he intensified his researches on German literature, a field that he had been cultivating for years. Cercignani was awarded the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class in 1996.  The student of English  Cercignani’s philological interests have been mainly directed towards the history of the English language, with especial regard to the Elizabethan period. His articles on English pronunciation at Shakespeare’s time (published in “Studia Neophilologica”, “English Studies” and other specialized journals) anticipate his major work Shakespeare's Works and Elizabethan Pronunciation (Oxford, 1981), which has been cited as «the best work available» on the subject.[Andrew Gurr, University of Reading, http://extra.shu.ac.uk/emls/07-1/gurrothe.htm] As «the foremost authority» on Elizabethan pronunciation,[David Kathman, http://shakespeareauthorship.com/name1.html] Cercignani is often cited on puns, rhymes, and spellings in the more recent editions of Shakespeare's works,[See, e.g., William Shakespeare, Henry V, edited by Gary Taylor, Oxford, University Press, 1998, p. 5 et passim, https://www.amazon.com/Henry-V-Oxford- Worlds-Classics/dp/0192834231#reader_0192834231] in most reference works on Shakespeare,[See, e.g., The New Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare, Cambridge, University Press, 2001] and in various publications dealing with linguistic and literary questions from a historical point of view.[See, e.g., Garrett Stewart, Reading Voices: Literature and the Phonotext, Berkeley, University of California Press, 1990, Ch. I, n. 20. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft3r29n8sp/]  The student of Germanic  Cercignani's philological interests have also been directed towards the historical phonology of the Germanic languages and other aspects of historical linguistics. Specialized journals like “Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung”, “Indogermanische Forschungen”, “Journal of English and Germanic Philology”, “Language”, “Beiträge zur Geschichte der deutschen Sprache und Literatur”, and “The Journal of Indo-European Studies” have published his articles on Proto-Germanic, Gothic, English and German. Some of these studies – e.g. Early 'umlaut' phenomena in the Germanic languages, in “Language”, 56/1, 1980 – are frequently cited for alternative views on early linguistic changes (e.g. Germanic a-mutation). Cercignani's notable work on The Consonants of German: Synchrony and Diachrony (Milan, 1979) «offers both an original contribution to German phonology and a first-rate account of the state of the art».[Anatoly Liberman, in “Die Unterrichtspraxis / Teaching German”, 13/2 (1980), p. 262.]  The student of German  Cercignani's literary interests have at first been directed towards the poetry of Karl Krolow, with essays published in “Germanisch-Romanische Monatsschrift”, “Literaturwissenschaftliches Jahrbuch”, and other journals (1984–1986). His study of Christa Wolf’s earlier novels (Existenz und Heldentum bei Christa Wolf. «Der geteilte Himmel» and «Kassandra», Würzburg, 1988) and subsequent essays on her later works have contributed to promote an awareness of the true essence of the narrative production of the East German writer, irrespective of her political and personal ups and downs. The emphasis placed by Cercignani on Christa Wolf’s heroism has opened the way to subsequent studies in this direction.[See, e.g., John Greenfield,: Die heilige Rita des Waggonbauwerks. Altgermanistische Überlegungen zu Christa Wolfs «Der geteilte Himmel», in “Neophilologus”, 81/3 (1997), p. 419, n. 4] The numerous other writers whose works Cercignani has subsequently studied include Jens Peter Jacobsen, Georg Trakl, Georg Büchner, Arthur Schnitzler, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Rainer Maria Rilke, Alban Berg, E.T.A. Hoffmann, Robert Musil, Novalis, Joseph Roth, Richard Beer-Hofmann, Karl Kraus, Franz Kafka, Thomas Mann, August Stramm, Gerhart Hauptmann, Reinhard Jirgl, Friedrich Schiller. Since 1992 Cercignani has been editor of the international periodical “Studia austriaca” (), a publication devoted to the culture and to the literature of Austria, past and present. This yearbook is published in collaboration with the Austrian Cultural Forum in Milan (Österreichisches Kulturforum Mailand). Since 1994 he has been editor also of “Studia theodisca” (), a periodical that accepts international essays on the literature of German-speaking countries.  The poet  Cercignani’s poetry is collected in seven booklets and includes also poems published in the “Almanacco dello Specchio”, “Anterem”, and other periodicals. Discussing his production, one critic speaks of orphic poetry, but «hard and shiny like steel»[Giorgio Bárberi Squarotti, preface to Fisicità svanite (Vanished Physicalities), p. 8.] and another remarks that Cercignani’s poems «achieve a maximum of concentration thanks to an acceleration of the thought or feeling which reconstructs physicality by means of abstraction».[Carlo Alessandro Landini, La poesia milanese e lombarda. Realtà e prospettive (Milanese and Lombard Poetry. Reality and Prospects), in “Hellas” 11/15 (1991), pp. 43-44.] Fausto Cercignani has also experimented with the self-translation of his poems.[See, for example, http://sites.unimi.it/austheod/adagio3l.pdf, where the author has translated his short poem Adagio into German, English and French.] = An adagio = ::::::::::::Adagio (2004)[Translated by the poet from: Adagio // Se parli con le ombre, / almeno sai chi sono / e le parole, tutte quante, / si dispiegano lente / sui muri pasticciati, / all’imbrunire. // Non dicono di cieli smisurati, / di amori come nuvole d’argento, / ma di meste città sgomitolate / su brughiere di musica sommessa. // E se parli con loro, ti ritrovi / cullato in quelle note, / come se la città fosse davvero / una grande brughiera di spartiti. // Che frusciano, / col tocco della brezza, / nel flusso pigreggiante dell’adagio.] ::::::::::::If you talk to the shadows, ::::::::::::at least you know them well ::::::::::::and the words, all of them, ::::::::::::unfold themselves with ease ::::::::::::on muddled walls and streets, ::::::::::::when dusk comes on. ::::::::::::They do not speak of boundless skies, ::::::::::::of passing loves like silver clouds. ::::::::::::They speak of cheerless towns, unwound: ::::::::::::on hazy moors of muffled music. ::::::::::::And if you talk to them, ::::::::::::you’ll find yourself ::::::::::::rocked in a stream of notes, ::::::::::::as if the town were truly ::::::::::::a shrubby land of music sheets. ::::::::::::Which rustle, ::::::::::::while fingered by the breeze, ::::::::::::in the sluggish progression of the adagio.

Brief review of Wings of Creation Critical response to The Silver Ship and the Sea was generally positive. Writing in Analog, Richard Foss criticized the pacing of the next book, \\"Reading the Wind\\". The book is about six genetically altered children who have been left on the planet Fremont after a war. Book review of The Silver Ship and the Sea. Book review of The Silver Ship and the Sea. Brief review of The Silver Ship and the Sea They were often mistreated because they descended from the altered who fought against the humans. These altered were stronger and faster, with better reflexes and sharper senses than the normal humans of Fremont. Synopsis In The Silver Ship and the Sea, there are six altered children: Chelo Lee, her brother Joseph, Kayleen, Bryan, Alicia, and Liam. Fremont had a single town, Artistos, where most of the people lived. There were also two bands of \\"Roamers\\": the east band and the west band. These travel around studying plants and animals. Chelo and Joseph lived with Artistos' leaders while Kayleen and Bryan lived with other families in the town. Liam went to the West Band, while Alicia was sent with the East Band. The book starts with Chelo narrating, telling how her brother Joseph, and her friend Kayleen, could hold \\"data streams\\" and could fix data networks. Joseph, especially, could use the data networks to sense people and predators in remote places, and see events such as crashing meteors. Chelo and Joseph's adoptive parents were out hunting with others when they were killed by an earthquake. The earthquake also caused much damage to Artistos. After this experience, Joseph was weak and shaken, and unable to do what he used to. Soon the East and West bands met in Artistos. Liam was treated better than anyone else, but Alicia had been accused of murder by Ruth, the East Band's leader. Judgment was reserved, and while Liam left with his adoptive father (and band's leader) Akashi, Alicia stayed. Bryan, who possessed enormous strength, was kept in Artistos. Tom and Paloma (2 people in Artistos sympathetic to the altered) took Joseph, Chelo, Kayleen and Alicia out of Artistos in an attempt to heal Joseph. Jenna, an altered adult who was left on Fremont, showed the four children around the battle headquarters of the altered. Joseph was completely healed with a help of \\"reading thread\\", and much more powerful than before. Jenna revealed to them their genemods (what they were altered to specialize in). Liam and Akashi soon joined them. They learned that Bryan had been severely hurt in a fight at Artistos, and was locked up. Joseph (who had learned that he could fly a ship) along with Jenna, Alicia, and Bryan (who was returned after Alicia threatened the people of Artistos with altered weaponry) left on the silver spaceship the New Making, while Chelo, Liam and Kayleen stayed behind. Chelo joined Liam in the West Band, and Kayleen remained with Paloma in Artistos. Development and Themes The Silver Ship and the Sea is Cooper's second novel. Cooper began writing the novel shortly after the September 11 attacks upon the United States. The beginning of the second Iraq War, which the author did not support, was a major influence in the development of the novel. The author Larry Niven also had a direct impact on Cooper's work. Largely concerned with ethics, major thematic elements of the novel are war and new technology, such as genetic engineering, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence. Characters The following are major characters within the series: *Chelo Lee: 17-year-old altered girl with genetic modifications (genemods) as a caretaker, planner, and strategist. *Joseph Lee: 14-year-old altered boy with genemods to hold \\"data streams\\" and a spaceship flyer. *Kayleen: 15-year-old altered girl with genemods to hold \\"data streams\\", and an exceptional runner. *Bryan: 15-year-old altered boy with genemods as a warrior/fighter, with enormous strength. *Liam: 16-year-old altered boy with genemods as a leader and strategist, and a quick learner. *Alicia: 16-year-old altered girl with genemods as a risk-taker and (in a way) a fighter. *Jenna: a crippled (but agile and strong) altered adult left behind on Fremont, who trained the children. *Akashi: West Band leader, adoptive father of Liam, kind to altered. *Paloma: Artistos resident, adoptive mother of Kayleen, kind to altered. *Tom: Artistos resident, caretaker of Chelo and Joseph after the earthquake, kind to altered. *Nava: Leader of Artistos after the earthquake, unkind to altered. *Ruth: Leader of the East Band, extremely dislikes altered. Other books in the series There are currently two other books in the series, Reading the Wind and Wings of Creation. A fourth book The Making War was projected. According to an interview by MilSciFi.com, the author did not originally plan to make the first book into a series. =Reading the Wind= Kayleen takes Liam and Chelo to the other continent Islandia, where they discover the mercenaries that have been hired to wipe out Fremont. Meanwhile, Joseph (who was an extremely powerful wind reader) and the others reach Silver's Home, and he is trained by someone called Marcus. When they find out about the mercenaries, they return to help battle them. =Wings of Creation= This book was released in November 2009.

He was the lead designer of the strategy game Civilization V, developed by Firaxis. Currently, Shafer is the president of Conifer Games, a video games development company he founded in 2012. The studio's first title is Jon Shafer's At The Gates, a 4X strategy game similar to Civilization in which players command a barbarian kingdom with the goal of defeating both rival tribes and the waning Roman Empire. The budget for developing At the Gates is primarily made up of funds raised through a Kickstarter campaign held in February 2013. Life and career Shafer was born and grew up in Aurora, Colorado. He learned to program when he was 8 years old from his father, and as a child also cultivated a passion for history. These interests led Shafer to Sid Meier's Civilization series. He developed fan mods for Civilization III while in high school, and became a beta tester for the Civilization III expansion pack, Conquests, and Civilization IV. Early in Civilization IV's development he wrote an extensive guide explaining how to utilize its Python scripting language, and this led to him joining Firaxis for a programming internship in February 2005. Shafer was later hired full-time, and served as a designer and programmer on the two Civilization IV expansions, Warlords and Beyond the Sword. Following the completion of Beyond the Sword, Shafer was named the lead designer and principal gameplay programmer for Civilization V, the next full title in the series. While in this role, Shafer drew from his past modding experience and from computer games he had played as a child, most notably Panzer General. In January 2011, Shafer joined Stardock to lead an unannounced game project and assist with development on the Elemental series. In February 2013, he announced that he had left Stardock and founded Conifer Games, and was now developing a new 4X title, At the Gates. In June 2017, Shafer joined Paradox Development Studio as a game director on an unannounced project, only to part ways in November of the same year, citing creative differences. Shafer attended Colorado State University from 2002–2005, studying history and computer science. After acquiring a position at Firaxis he left Colorado State but later completed his undergraduate study at Towson University in 2006 with a BS in History.

It was the first Security Council resolution adopted in 2003. The Security Council urged all states to implement Resolution 1373 and reaffirmed the need to combat threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts. It condemned Al-Qaeda and other associated groups for ongoing terrorist attacks, and attacks referred to in resolutions 1368 (2001), 1438 (2002), 1440 (2002) and 1450 (2002). Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council decided to improve the implementation of the measures, with a view to further improving them in 12 months if required. The measures included a freezing of funds and financial resources, an arms embargo and travel ban. The need for improved exchange of information between Committees established in resolutions 1268 and 1373 was stressed. All states were called upon to report within 90 days on steps they had taken to implement the sanctions against the Taliban, Al-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, including related investigations and enforcement, unless such investigations would be compromised. The Secretary-General Kofi Annan was requested to reappoint five experts to monitor the implementation of the sanctions over a period of 12 months and to pursue leads relating to incomplete implementation of measures. The Secretary-General also had to ensure that the Committee and Monitoring Group of experts had sufficient access to resources and expertise, and to provide reports and oral assessments to the Council on their findings, with a focus on better co-ordination.

Monelle wrote three books, dozens of articles on music, and many music criticism reviews in newspapers, mainly for Opera and The Independent His main field of research was Music Signification or, as it is also known, Music Semiotics. Towards the end of his life he wrote a novel, yet to be published, entitled Bird in the Apple Tree, about the adolescence of the composer Alban Berg. Education Monelle received a Master of Arts degree in modern history from the University of Oxford and Bachelor of Music degree from the University of London. A member of the Royal Musical Association at least since 1968, he completed his Ph.D. at the University of Edinburgh with a doctoral thesis on \\"Opera seria as drama: the musical dramas of Hasse and Metastasio\\", which he wrote under the supervision of David Kimbell. Scholarship Monelle was renowned for his research in the field of music signification (the semiotics of music). His three books, many articles and countless lectures, presented in various venues all over Europe, North America and Israel, had an immense impact on the international music scholarship scene. In 1988 he joined the Music Signification Project, founded by Eero Tarasti two years earlier, and became one of the project's leaders, acting as keynote speaker and editor of proceedings in all the International Congresses of Music Signification that followed. His publications touch a wide variety of subjects and musical styles, but focus mainly on two subjects: the analysis of music as text and The Musical Topic. In the first subject, Monelle was strongly influenced by Derrida's writings on deconstruction. On the second subject, he presented a research into the topics of the military. Toward the end of his life, he began studying the subject of The Musical Sublime, inspired by the writings of Slavoj Žižek. Teaching activities Monelle joined the Faculty of Music at the University of Edinburgh in 1969 serving throughout the 1970s as conductor of the university society choir and opera club, and teaching History, Counterpoint, Harmony, Analysis, and the Semiotics of Music. Most famous classes were his \\"Wagner Project Weeks\\" in which he took students for a week away from Edinburgh to Holy Island, off the coast of Northumberland, for a week of listening and study of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. He was granted the title of a Reader in 1992(?) and full professorship in 2002(?) the year in which he retired from the university of Edinburgh. After his retirement he continued to teach theory and counterpoint at Napier University in Edinburgh. Composition and performance Monelle composed several works: among them works for piano and for organ, choir arrangements of Christmas Carols and a Mass setting for choir and orchestra, which he later adapted for choir and organ for the choir of Old St Paul's, Edinburgh.. He did some conducting, mainly of choral and opera productions, and was particularly known for his skilled jazz piano playing. He also nurtured the careers of two of Scotland's most notable living musicians, Donald Runnicles and James MacMillan.

History Malchower Fussballclub and the worker's sports club Arbeitersportverein Kloster-Malchow were established in 1911. Worker's clubs were regarded as politically undesirable under the Third Reich and these two sides were merged in 1938 to form the ideologically palatable club Verein für Leibesübungen Malchow. Following World War II, organizations across the country, including football and sports clubs, were disbanded by occupying Allied authorities as part of the postwar de-Nazification program. Sportgemeinde Malchow was formed in 1946 out of the memberships of the pre-war clubs. On 6 August 1949, SG was split into two clubs: SG Malchow and BSG Tufama. Just a year later the football sides of these two clubs were reunited as BSG Fortschritt Malchow. The city was located in the Soviet occupation zone and the football club was part of the separate football competition that emerged in East Germany. SV was a lower tier local side throughout its history in East German competition. With the reunification of the country in 1990, the membership of Fortschritt organized themselves as Malchower Sportverein and became part of the single national competition in the Landesliga Mecklenburg- Vorpommern (VI) out of the Bezirksliga Neubrandenburg. The Landesliga became the Verbandsliga Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in 1996. SV was relegated for a single season in 1996 with their best result coming as a second-place finish in 2007 and 2009.

In the [Portuguese] right wing, the forces of Cardinal [Mendoza] and Duke of Alba and the nobles do the same. But in the [Portuguese] left Wing, in front of the Asturians and Galician, the reinforcement army of the Prince heir of Portugal, well provided with artillery, could leave the battlefield with its head high. The battle resulted this way, inconclusive. But its global result stays after that decided by the withdrawal of the Portugal's King [not as its direct consequence since this only happened three months and a half later, on 13 June 1476, after several military operations], the surrender of the Zamora's fortress on Mars 19, and the multiple adhesions of the nobles to the young princes.\\" However, it was a major political victory for the Catholic Monarchs by assuring to Isabella the throne of Castile: The remnants of the nobles loyal to Juana de Trastámara adhered to Isabella. With great political vision, Isabella took advantage of the moment and summoned the 'Cortes' at Madrigal- Segovia (April–October 1476).Lunenfeld, p. 27: \\"In 1476, immediately after the indecisive battle of Peleagonzalo, Ferdinand and Isabella hailed the result as a great victory and called the 'Cortes' at Madrigal.

There her daughter was proclaimed sworn heiress of the Castile's crown, which was equivalent to legitimizing her own throne. As noted by Spanish academic António Serrano: \\"From all of this it can be deduced that the battle [of Toro] was inconclusive, but Isabella and Ferdinand made it fly with wings of victory. (...) Actually, since this battle transformed in victory; since 1 March 1476, Isabella and Ferdinand started to rule in the Spain's throne. (...) The inconclusive wings of the battle became the secure and powerful wings of San Juan's eagle [the commemorative temple of the battle of Toro] \\".Serrano, pp. 55–70. The war continued until the peace of Alcáçovas (1479), and the official propaganda transformed the Battle of Toro into a victory which avenged Aljubarrota.Torres p. 303: \\"...later... were those [attempts] of Alfonso V to the Castilian crown [that] also finished by tiredness and not by the indecisive battle of Toro, which was transformed by the Spanish in another Aljubarrota...\\"Lozoya, p. 85: \\"This famous Franciscan convent [San Juan de los Reyes] intended to be a replica of the Batalha [the Portuguese monastery built after Aljubarrota], and was built to commemorate the indecisive battle of Toro.\\"Spanish historian Beretta, p. 56: \\"His moment is the inconclusive Battle of Toro.(...) both sides attributed themselves the victory (...) The letters written by the King [Ferdinand] to the main cities (...) are a model of skill. (...) what a powerful description of the battle! The nebulous transforms into light, the doubtful acquires the profile of a certain triumph. The politic [Ferdinand] achieved the fruits of a discussed victory.\\"Palenzuela: \\"That is the battle of Toro. The Portuguese army had not been exactly defeated, however, the sensation was that D. Juana's cause had completely sunk. It made sense that for the Castilians Toro was considered as the divine retribution, the compensation desired by God to compensate the terrible disaster of Aljubarrota, still alive in the Castilian memory\\". (Electronic version). Overview Spanish historians Luis Suárez Fernández, Juan de Mata Carriazo and Manuel Fernández Álvarez : Precedents =Background= The death of Henry IV of Castile, in 1474, led to a succession crisis and the formation of two rival parties: Isabella, the King's half sister, received the support of the majority of the noblemen, clerks and people, whereas Juana de Trastámara, the King's daughter, was supported by some powerful nobles.Palenzuela. This rivalry degenerated in civil war and the Portuguese King Afonso V intervened in the defence of his niece Juana's rights, to whom he married. He tried to unify the crowns of Castile and Portugal as an alternative to the union of Castile with Aragon, personified in the marriage of Isabella to Ferdinand, the heir of Aragon's throne. Ferdinand II of Aragon, married with Isabella. He conquered two peninsular kingdoms (Navarra and Granada), launching the foundations of Modern Spain. He also defeated the French in Italy. =The Burgos expedition: turning point of the war= After some skirmishes, Afonso V's army marched for the rescue of the besieged castle inside Burgos. On the way, at Baltanás, it defeated and imprisoned a force of 400 spearmen of the Count of Benavente (18 – XI – 1475)Pina, 3rd book, chapter CLXXX. and also took Cantalapiedra, reaching the distance of only 60 km from Burgos.Fernández, p. 139. The Castilian allies pressed Afonso V to advance south towards Madrid, where they assured him many supporters. The King, who did not want to stretch his communication lines with Portugal, didn't listen to them and withdrew leaving Burgos to its fate. The city surrendered on 28 January 1476, and Afonso's prestige sank. It is the turning point of the war: Ocaña and other places changed side, the Estuñiga family defected, the mighty Marquis of Villena, Diego López Pacheco, denied his military support and the Juanista band began its dissolution. =Zamora: prelude to the Battle of Toro= Afonso V preferred to secure its line of cities and strongholds along the Duero River, but on 4 December 1475, a part of the Zamora's garrisona key Juanista cityrebelled and besieged the inner fortress, where the Portuguese took refuge. Ferdinand II of Aragon entered the city next day. At the end of January 1476, Afonso V received the reinforcement troops led by his own son, the Perfect Prince,Title awarded to him by Lope de Vega in his piece The Perfect Prince, part I. and in the middle of February 1476, the combined Portuguese forces besieged Ferdinand's Army (locked inside the city of Zamora), putting him in the curious situation of besieger being besieged. After two cold and rainy weeks, the besiegers decided to leave and rest in the city of Toro. Ferdinand pursued and reached them near Toro, where both armies decided to engage in battle. Disposition of the forces =Isabelist army of D. Ferdinand= * Centre: Commanded by Ferdinand, it included the royal guard and forces of several hidalgos, like Count of Lemos and the mayordomo mayor Enrique Enriquez. It was formed mainly by popular militias of several cities like Zamora, Ciudad Rodrigo or Valladolid.Pulgar, chapter XLV. *Right wing: it had 6 divisions (\\"batallas\\" or \\"battles\\") of light cavalry or jennets,Góis, chapters LXXVII and LXXVIII (description of both armies). Sometimes Góis mentions 6 divisions in the Castilian right and other times 2 big divisions, because the Castilian right wing was divided in two parts: 5 advanced battles and a rear one (as a reserve). commanded by their captains: Álvaro de Mendoza (the main captain), the Bishop of Ávila and Alfonso de Fonseca (these two men shared the command of one battle), Pedro de Guzmán, Bernal Francés, Vasco de Vivero and Pedro de Velasco. This wing is sometimes called vanguard as some of his men closely followed the Portuguese from Zamora to Toro. It was divided in two lines: five battles at the forefront and one in the rear. *Left wing: here were many knights with heavy armour, divided in 3 corps: the left one, near the Portuguese, commanded by Admiral Enríquéz; the centre one, led by Cardinal Mendoza, and on the right, the force headed by the Duke of Alba. It was the most powerful. *Reserve forces: the men of Enrique Enríquez, Count of Alba de Aliste (King Ferdinand's uncle and Galicia's governor, who would be taken prisoner by the Portuguese); and the horsemen from the marquis of Astorga. The foot soldiers were in the middle of all those battles. In practical terms, the Isabelist army fought on two separate fronts: right wing and left-centre or Royal Battle (due to the presence of Ferdinand). =Portuguese-Castilian army of Afonso V / The Perfect Prince= *Centre: commanded by Afonso V, it was formed by the knights of several noblemen from his House and the Castilian knights loyal to D. Juana led by Rui Pereira. It also had 4 bodies of footmen with their backs turned to the Duero River. *Right wing: troops of some Portuguese nobles and the Castilians of the Toledo's Archbishop, Alfonso Carrillo. *Left wing: here were the elite troops of the kingdom (chevaliers) together with the army's artillery (arquebusiers) and the javelin throwers. It was commanded by the Perfect Prince, who had as his main captain the Bishop of Évora. It included a rear guard battle under Pedro de Meneses.Góis, chapters LXXVII and LXXVIII. Because of the split of leadership between the King and Prince, the Portuguese army also fought divided into two parts which didn't help each other:Mattoso, p. 382. left wing or Prince's battle and right-centre or Royal Battle. Battle =The Perfect Prince defeats the right wing of Ferdinand's army= The forces of Prince John and of the Bishop of Évora, formed by arquebusiers, javelin throwers, and by the Portuguese elite knights, screaming \\"St. George! St. George!\\", invested the six bodies or battles in the right wing of the Castilian army. The Prince attacked the five advanced battles while the battle of Pedro de Meneses attacked the other one.Góis, chapter LXXVIII. The Castilian forces (which were very select) withdrew in disorder, after suffering heavy losses. Chronicler Hernando del Pulgar (Castilian): \\"promptly, those 6 Castilian captains, which we already told were at the right side of the royal battle, and were invested by the prince of Portugal and the bishop of Évora, turned their backs and put themselves on the run\\". Chronicler Garcia de Resende (Portuguese): \\"and being the battles of both sides ordered that way and prepared to attack by nearly sunshine, the King ordered the prince to attack the enemy with his and God's blessing, which he obeyed (...). (...) and after the sound of the trumpets and screaming all for S. George invested so bravely the enemy battles, and in spite of their enormous size, they could not stand the hard fight and were rapidly beaten and put on the run with great losses.\\" Resende, chapter XIII. Chronicler Pedro de Medina (Castilian): \\"In the Portuguese left wing, where the people of the Prince of Portugal and from the Bishop of Évora were, a very cruel battle began in which the Castilians were defeated: due to the large artillery and shotgun's bullets from the enemy, a huge number of Castilians promptly fell dead and was necessary to remove another crowd of wounded men. As for the remaining, they found a great resistance in the Portuguese since this was their strongest army's side, as already told, and were forced to withdraw (...). Having been so easily defeated the right battle of the Castilian army; the other two attacked their respective counterparts in order to avenge the affront and losses.\\" Medina, pp. 218–219. Chronicler Juan de Mariana (Castilian): \\" ... the [Castilian] horsemen ... moved forward(...).They were received by prince D. John... whose charge... they couldn't stand but were instead defeated and ran away.\\"Mariana, book XXIV, chapter X, p. 299,300. Chronicler Damião de Góis (Portuguese): \\"... these Castilians who were on the right of the Castilian Royal battle, received [the charge of] the Prince's men as brave knights invoking Santiago but they couldn't resist them and began to flee, and [so] our men killed and arrested many of them, and among those who escaped some took refuge ... in their Royal battle which was on the left of these six [Castilian] divisions.\\". Chronicler Garibay (Spanish): \\" ... D. Alfonso de Fonseca first and then Álvaro de Mendoza ... and other [captains] begged the King [Ferdinand] permission to be the first to attack the Prince's squad ... which was the strength of the Portuguese army, and the King authorized them, provided that the six battles named above remained together (...). And facing the Prince's squads ... they were defeated, many of them dying due to artillery and javelin throwers ... and this way, the victory in the beginning was for the Portuguese ...\\"Garibay, book 18, chapter VII, p. 597. Chevaliers and footmen in combat (battle of Grandson, 2 March 1476). The Prince's men pursued the fugitives along the land. The Prince, in order to avoid the dispersion of his troops, decided to make a halt: \\"and the prince, as a wise captain, seeing the great victory God had given to him and the good fate of that hour, chose to secure the honour of victory than follow the chase.\\"( Garcia de Resende) But some of his men went too far (Rui de Pina says during a league, 5 km)Pina, 3rd book, chapter CXCI. and paid the price: \\"and some of the important people and others ... in the heat of victory chased [the fugitives] so deeply that they were killed or captured.\\" According to Rui de Pina, this happened because some of these fugitives, after a hard chase, gathered with one of Ferdinand's battles on the rear and faced the most temerarious pursuers. Pulgar confirms this post chase episode: \\"Many of those who were on those 6 Castilian battles defeated by the Prince of Portugal at the beginning, seeing the victory of the other king's battles on their respective side [left wing and centre], assembled with the people of the King and fought again\\" (3 hours after the beginning of the battle, according to him). Pulgar justifies the defeat of the Isabelistas with the fact that the Prince's battle attacked as a block, while the Castilians were divided into six battles. So, each of them was successively beaten off without benefiting from the help of the others. Another factor cited by the same chronicler was \\"the great loss\\" suffered by the Castilians as a result of the fire from the many arquebusiers in the Prince's battle. Zurita adds that the Prince successfully attacked with such \\"impetus\\" that the remaining men of the Castilian army became \\"disturbed\\". These events had important consequences. The Portuguese chroniclers unanimously stated what Rui de Pina synthesized this way: \\" ... king D. Ferdinand ... as soon as he saw defeated his first and big battles [on the right], and believing the same fate would happen to his own battles at the hands of King Afonso's battles, was counselled to withdraw as he did to Zamora\\". Among the Castilians, Pulgar – the official chronicler of the Catholic Monarchs – says that Ferdinand withdrew from the battlefield for other reasons. Its justification: \\"the King promptly returned to the city of Zamora [\\"volvió luego\\"] because he was told that people from the King of Portugal, located in the city of Toro on the other side of the river, could attack the \\"estanzas\\" he left besieging the Zamora's fortress. And the cardinal and the duke of Alba stayed on the battlefield (...).\\" Not only Pulgar reveals that Ferdinand left the battlefield before Cardinal Mendoza and the duke of Alba, but the expression \\"promptly returned\\" seems to indicate that the King stayed a small time on the battlefield, delegating the leadership on these two main commanders.Garibay also says that Ferdinand left the battlefield before Cardinal Mendoza, the Duke of Alba and the Portuguese: book 18, chapter VII, p. 597. On the other hand, it was highly improbable that Ferdinand risked helping Zamora in a Royal battle which was deciding the destiny of the entire kingdom of Castile. This city wasn't at risk since it was inconceivable that the small Portuguese garrison of Toro dared to attack in a very dark and rainy night the powerful and distant city of Zamora (29,2 km in straight way, but farther through the mountains), instead of helping the forces of his King and Prince which were fighting with difficulties practically at its gates. The victorious Prince's forces (which included the best Portuguese troops) were still on the field and were continuously raising their numbers with dispersed men converging to them from every corner of the field.Góis, chapter LXXIX.\\"...the Prince of Portugal stayed with a big battle... on top of a hill... gathering many...\\" in Bernaldez, chapter XXIII, p. 61. According to the chivalry codes of that time, to withdraw from the battlefield under these circumstances instead of confronting this new threat and not remaining 3 days on the battlefield -as a sign of victory- Chivalry tradition of remaining three days on the battlefield after the end of the battle -as a sign of victory and to give the enemy the opportunity of contesting the result- based on the German custom of Sessio triduana, which determined that the buyer of an immobile should stay on it in the three subsequent days after the purchase to consummate the appropriation, which became by this way indisputable, in Mattoso, p. 244. would be the proof that he had not won. Indeed, it is much more probable that Ferdinand had retreated to Zamora in the beginning of the battle as a consequence of the defeat of the right side of his army (things could get worse).Góis, chapter LXXVIII, p. 303 adds that before leaving the battlefield, Ferdinand sent word to the Duke of Alba and Cardinal Mendoza to assume command and to do their best. When Ferdinand and those with him reached Zamora very late that night, they didn't know \\"if they were winners or defeated\\". However, there's a sharp contrast between the prudent but orderly retreat of Ferdinand to Zamora and the precipitated escape of Afonso V to avoid imprisonment. =The Royal Battle of Ferdinand defeats the Royal Battle of Afonso V= In the meantime, the other Castilian troops were fighting a fierce combat with their direct opponents. The Castilian centre charged the Portuguese centre while the Castilian left wing, superiorly commanded by Cardinal Mendoza and Duke of Alba, attacked the Portuguese right wing: \\"...those from the battle of the King [Castilian centre] as well as those...from the left wing, charged [respectively] against the battle of the King of Portugal...and against the other Portuguese of their right wing.\\" Cardinal Mendoza among other cardinals. Both a brilliant military leader and a very respected voice by the Catholic Monarchs. Sensing the hesitation of his forces because of the Portuguese attack on the other end of the battlefield, the cardinal rode forward and shouted, \\"here is the cardinal, traitors!\\". He would be wounded but kept fighting with bravery. The Portuguese started to break. The struggle around the Portuguese royal standard was ferocious: having the flag carrier's (the ensign Duarte de Almeida) hand cut off, he transferred the standard to the remaining hand which was also cut off. So he sustained the standard on the air with his teeth until he fainted under the wounds inflicted by the enemies which surrounded and captured him. Afonso V, seeing his standard lost and supposing he had equally beaten his son's forces (which were smaller than his) sought death in combat, but was prevented from doing so by those around him. They took him to Castronuño where he was welcomed by the alcalde. By then, the Portuguese disbanded in all directions and many of them drowned in the Duero River because of the darkness and confusion. The Castilians captured 8 flags and sacked the Portuguese camp. Bernaldez painted a grandiose picture of the loot mentioning many horses, prisoners, gold, silver and clothes, which was doubtful given the dark and rainy night described by the chroniclers. In fact, Pulgar recognizes that the product of the loot was modest: \\"and the people who participated on the battle during the previous day divided the captured spoils: which were in small quantity because it was a very dark night\\".Pulgar, chapter XLVII. Pulgar: \\"At last the portuguese couldn't stand the mighty force of the castilians and were defeated, and they ran seeking refuge in the city of Toro.(...) [the] Portugal's King seeing the defeat of his men, gave up of going to Toro to avoid being molested by the men of the King [Ferdinand], and with three or four men of all those who were responsible for his security went to Castronuño that night. (...) consequently many Portuguese were killed or taken prisoners...\\" Pulgar wrote that a large number of both Castilians and Portuguese died in the battle, but while the Castilians died fighting, the Portuguese drowned while trying to escape by swimming across the river Duero. Rui de Pina justifies the Portuguese Royal Battle's defeat with the fact that the best Portuguese troops were with the Prince and were missed by the King, and also because there were many arquebusiers in the Castilian Royal Battle whose fire scared the Portuguese horses. Afonso V, the \\"African\\". With the darkness of the night and the intense rain, chaos reigned. There were dispersed men from all sides: fugitives from the Castilian right wing, Portuguese pursuers, fugitive soldiers from the Portuguese King, the Cardinal Mendoza's men and the Duke of Alba's men were divided between pursuing the Portuguese and sacking their spoils and still; the Prince's men returned in the meantime.The battlefield became a very dangerous place where the minimal error could lead to death or imprisonment. As an example and according to Pulgar, some Portuguese shouted \\"Ferdinand, Ferdinand!\\" to lure their pursuers making them think they were Castilians. As a consequence of this triumph, Ferdinand promptly sent a letter to the cities of Castile claiming victory,Manchado, pp. 195, 196. but without mentioning neither the defeat of part of his forces nor the retreat of his remaining troops when faced with the forces of Prince John, who possessed the camp and also claimed victory. Later, the Perfect Prince also sent a letter to the main cities of Portugal, Lisbon and Porto, ordering the commemoration of his triumph on the battle of Toro (but not mentioning his father's defeat) with a solemn procession on each anniversary of the battle.Duro, p. 250: \\"...For those who ignore the background of these circumstances it will certainly seem strange that while the Catholic Monarchs raised a temple in Toledo in honour of the victory that God grant them on that occasion, the same fact [the Battle of Toro] was festively celebrated with solemn processions on its anniversary in Portugal\\". Isabella immediately ordered a thanks giving procession at Tordesillas, and in many other cities feasts and religious ceremonies were organized to celebrate the great \\"victory God has given to the King and to her people.\\"Pulgar, chapter XLVI. She would also build a magnificent commemorative Gothic temple at Toledo, the Monastery of S. Juan de los Reyes, to dissipate any doubts and perpetuate her victory. As the Historian Justo Gonzalez summarizes: \\"Both armies faced each other at the camps of Toro resulting in an undecided battle. But while the Portuguese King reorganized his troops, Ferdinand sent news to all the cities of Castile and to several foreign kingdoms informing them about a huge victory where the Portuguese were crushed. Faced with these news, the party of \\"la Beltraneja\\" [Juana] was dissolved and the Portuguese were forced to return to their kingdom.\\"González, p. 68. The key of the war was the Castilian public opinion, not the Portuguese. =The Perfect Prince becomes master of the battlefield= Meanwhile Prince John returned after a brief chase, defeating one of the Castilian battles where the men were dispersed looting the spoils of the defeated Portuguese. However, faced with other enemy battles, he abstained from attacking and put his men in a defensive position on a hill. He lighted big fires and played the trumpets to guide all the Portuguese spread throughout the camp towards him and to defy the enemy. He acted this way because, according to the chronicler Álvaro Chaves, the Prince's forces were under-numbered as most of his men had gone in pursuit of the adversaries: \\"(...) [the Prince] turned against the battles of king D. Ferdinand, but because the people from his battles spread in the pursue of the defeated, the enemy's battle outnumbered the few men that remained with him, but in spite of that he attacked and defeated it and he went on until he faced other enemy battles, and then he stopped his battle to recover some of his dispersed men (...) because the enemy had the triple of his people.\\"Chaves in Duro, p. 254-257. Pulgar: \\"And because the people of his father and King were defeated and dispersed, the Prince of Portugal went up to a hill and played the trumpets and lighted fires in order to recover some of the fugitives and stood on with his battle...\\" praised by his adversary Ferdinand. This happened when some nobles pressed King Ferdinand to force his royal chronicler Pulgar to change what he wrote about Prince John during that battle.Those nobles should plausibly be relatives or proximal to the seven captains who led the Castilian army's right wing on the battle of Toro and that were defeated and chased by the Prince's men. In Resende, chapter CLIV. Indeed, the Castilian chronicles reveal that the Perfect Prince was the only leader who fulfilled all the premises of a winner: he defeated a part of the enemy, he stood \\"without suffering defeat\\" (Juan de Mariana), and finally he mastered the battlefield (Bernaldez, and Juan de Mariana). Ferdinand summed up the battle of Toro in a private letter to Isabella: \\"if it had not been for the chicken [Prince John], the old cock [Afonso V] would have been taken.\\"Since, as stated by Garibay himself (book 18, chapter VII), Prince John did not come to the aid of Afonso V throughout the battle of Toro – both were always too far from each other – this Ferdinand's sentence only makes sense with a victorious and permanently threatening Prince on the battlefield. Ferdinand's letter reported by Spanish chronicler Garibay, book 18, chapter VIII. The Prince's men took some prisoners, among them King Ferdinand's uncle, D. Enrique, Count of Alba de Liste, and for his great joy, they retook his father's royal standard as well as the Castilian noble who carried it, Souto Mayor (according to the chroniclers Rui de Pina, Garcia de Resende Damião de Góis). With the Prince's forces increasing continuously, no military leader could be considered winner without defeating this new threat, which included the Portuguese elite troops who had defeated the Castilian right wing. Zurita: \\"This could have been a very costly victory if the Prince of Portugal, who always had his forces in good order, and was very near the river banks, had attacked our men who were dispersed and without order\\". The Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba began to join their dispersed men to remove the new threat: \\"against who [Prince John] the Spain's cardinal as well as the Duke of Alba intended to go with some men that they were able to collect from those returned from the chase and from those who were spread around the camp capturing horses and prisoners...\\" ( Pulgar). Two great heterogeneous battles (a Portuguese and a Castilian one) formed this way, standing face to face and playing musical instruments to intimidate each other: \\"(...) so close were the men from one part and the other, that some knights went out of the battles to invest with the spears [individual combats]\\" (Álvaro Lopes). But the Cardinal and the Duke of Alba couldn't convince their men to move and attack the Prince's forces: \\"(...) and they couldn't join and move the men\\". That's corroborated by the Portuguese chronicler Garcia de Resende: \\"being very close to him [the Prince] so many men of King D. Ferdinand, they didn't dare to attack him because they had seen his men fighting so bravely and observed the security and order of his forces (...)\\" Pulgar felt the necessity to justify the fact that the Castilians, which assumed the victory, didn't attack the victorious Prince and have instead retreated to Zamora: \\"(...) because the night was so dark they [the Castilians] couldn't neither see nor recognize each other and because the men were so tired and haven't eaten all day as they left Zamora by morning (...) and turned back to the city of Zamora.\\" These circumstances, which applied to the enemy as well, don't explain the Castilian behaviour: the chronicles of both sides show that the Prince's battle kept increasing (making a \\"gross battle\\"), because towards it moved many defeated and fugitives from the Royal Battle and also the Prince's men coming back from the enemy's chase, and even contingents of soldiers from Toro, which crossed the battlefield to reinforce the Prince. Thus, if all these men could reach the Prince, the Castilians could do it too, especially because the two battles (the Portuguese and the Castilian) were so proximal that the men could listen to each other: \\"(...) being so close to each other [the Portuguese and the Castilians] that they could hear what they talked about (...)\\" (Garcia de Resende). At last the Castilians withdrew in disorder to Zamora. Rui de Pina: \\"And being the two enemy battles face to face, the Castilian battle was deeply agitated and showing clear signs of defeat if attacked as it was without King and dubious of the outcome.(...) And without discipline and with great disorder they went to Zamora. So being the Prince alone on the field without suffering defeat but inflicting it on the adversary he became heir and master of his own victory\\". Damião de Góis: \\"being the night so advanced (...) the Castilians left the camp in small groups (...) and neither the Cardinal of Castile nor the duke of Alba could impose them order; they also went to Zamora with the men who remained with them in the most silent way possible as all the people had fled (...) and the Prince realizing their retreat didn't pursue them (...) because he feared [that the Castilian retreat was] a war trap, but that wasn't the intention of the Castilians because by morning not a soul was seen on the field(...), resulting in a victorious Prince with all his people in order(...)\\" Álvaro de Chaves: \\"They abruptly left the camp towards Zamora as defeated men\\" Garcia de Resende: \\"And after the Prince had been most of the night on the battlefield, and seeing that the enemy had fled leaving no soul behind, and having nothing more to do, he decided to stand on the camp for three days (...)\\". He would be convinced by the Toledo's Archbishop to stay there only 3 hours as a symbol of the 3 days. After defeating their direct opponents and because of the dark and rainy night, Prince John's tactical choice had been to prevent the dissemination of his forces during the subsequent chase, slowly gathering the scattered men from all proveniences, in order to recover his lost operational power and attack the Castilians early the next day. The Prince made a triumphal march towards Toro, carrying his Castilian prisoners, and \\"with his flags draping and at the sound of trumpets.\\" But very soon the sadness dominated him because nobody knew where his father, the King, was. Besides that, the city of Toro was chaotic, with its gates closed because the Portuguese mistrusted their Castilian allies who they accused of treason and blamed for the defeat of their King. The Prince ordered the gates to be opened, restored the order and on the next day he sent a force to Castronuño, which brought back the King. He also \\"sent some of his captains to the battlefield to bury the dead and to redact a victory act, which was entirely made without contradiction\\". The fact that the Portuguese remained masters of the battlefield is documented in contemporary sources from both sides:In Medieval battles – especially when both kings left the battlefield – it was particularly important to keep the battlefield (Medieval war historian João Monteiro quoted in Nova História Militar de Portugal, 1st book, 2003, p.384). Even Juan de Mariana recognized the importance of dominating the battlefield of Toro: \\"...The Portuguese kept their position during more time, which was some relief to the setback...\\" Ironically, although Mariana attributed the victory to the Castilians, his description of the battle furiously points towards a draw: Mariana, book XXIV, chapter X, p.300. Pulgar first states that King Ferdinand withdrew from the battlefield to Zamora before Cardinal Mendoza and the Duke of Alba, and then he declares that his army (now under command of the Cardinal and Duke) also withdrew from the battlefield to Zamora – after an attempt to attack Prince John, who was thus left in possession of the battlefield. And Bernaldez explicitly wrote that the Prince only returned to Toro after the withdrawal of Ferdinand's army: \\"The people of King D. Ferdinand, both horsemen and peons, plundered the camp and all the spoils they found in front of the Prince of Portugal, who during that night never moved from top of a hill, until (...) King D. Ferdinand left to Zamora with his people plus the spoils. Then, the Prince of Portugal left to Toro.\\" Juan de Mariana corroborates him: \\"(...) the enemy led by prince D. John of Portugal, who without suffering defeat, stood on a hill with his forces in good order until very late (...). Thus, both forces [Castilians and Portuguese] remained face to face for some hours; and the Portuguese kept their position during more time (...)\\" Balance Complete medieval armour The Portuguese chronicles agree with the Castilian official chronicler Pulgar in most of the essential facts about the battle of Toro. Both show that the strongest part of each army (the Castilian and Portuguese left wings, respectively led by Cardinal Mendoza and Prince John) never fought each other: only at the end, says Pulgar, there was an unsuccessful attempt of Cardinal Mendoza and Duke of Alba to attack the forces of the Prince, quickly followed by a withdrawal of the Castilian army to Zamora. This was probably decisive for the final outcome of the battle, because each one of the armies won where it was stronger. Naturally the Castilian and Portuguese chroniclers focused their attention on their respective victory. * Each side had a part of its army defeated and one part winner (the Castilian army had its right wing defeated and its left-centre winner. The Portuguese army had its right-centre defeated and its left wing victorious); * Both Kings left the battlefield: Ferdinand to Zamora in an orderly way (probably after the victorious attack of the Prince) and Afonso V fled after the defeat of his Royal Battle by the Castilian left-centre; * The battlefield stood in possession of the Prince's forces increased by many combatants spread throughout the camp which converged to him (tactical victory); * The Portuguese royal standard was retaken by the Prince's men; * The losses were large in both armies (in relative terms) but small in absolute value; * Both sides proclaimed victory; * The battle represented a victory for the aspirations of Isabella to the throne of Castile, regardless its uncertain military outcome.Miller, p. 270: \\"But, if the outcome of [the battle of] Toro, militarily, is debatable, there is no doubt whatsoever as to its enormous psychological and political effects\\". As the Spanish historian Ana Isabel Carrasco Manchado puts it: \\"It's difficult to assess the importance of this battle from a military perspective. Indubitably, it represented a moral turning point for the party of Isabella and Ferdinand.\\" The polemic Indeed, the Battle of Toro consisted almost in two separated combats: one won by the troops of Prince John and the other by Ferdinand's forces. None of the intervenients had access to a global vision of the battle due to the geographic separation of the two engagements and also because of the darkness, fog and rain. Therefore, it is natural that separated combats with different outcomes have originated different versions among the chroniclers of both sides, and as revealed by Pulgar, between Castilians and Portuguese: \\"there held the old question about the force and bravery\\". Due to all of this, the only way to get a historical and impartial reconstitution of the Battle of Toro is by analyzing the sources of both sides. In fact, there is not an essential contradiction between the victory proclamations of both sides. As observed by the Spanish academic Luis Suárez Fernández: \\"But this document [Ferdinand's letter communicating his victory to the cities] of great importance does not contain more than the bare attribution of the victory to the Castilian arms, and doesn't contradict in any way the reality of one part of the Portuguese army, winner of one of the [Castilian] wings, staying on the camp and being able to retreat on the next day without being hindered. Neither is contradiction in the admission that being a dubious business it represented a very great political victory to Ferdinand and Isabella as it finished what still remained from the Juana' s party.\\"Fernández, p. 178 (footnote 61). The recovery of the Portuguese royal standard The Portuguese chroniclers unanimously state that the Portuguese royal standard was retaken from the enemy by Gonçalo Pires, whose nickname became Bandeira (in Portuguese it means \\"Flag\\") in memory of that deed, and so he became Gonçalo Pires Bandeira (coat of arms chart conceded on 4 July 1483 by King John II).Duro. The Castilian who carried it – Souto Mayor – was captured and the others fled. The Portuguese chronicler Rui de Pina made a hard critic to the King himself. He accuses Afonso V of ingratitude towards Gonçalo Pires, the man who served him so well and retook the lost standard: the royal rent given to him was so miserable (5,000 Reis) that he had to work in agriculture in order to survive (the manual work as a stigma to the medieval mentality). This was certainly common knowledge, because other way it would be a gratuitous slander to the King Afonso V (uncle of the monarch Manuel I to whom Rui de Pina wrote his chronicle) from which his author wouldn't benefit at all.\\"(...) not even the squire has become happy: because in spite of the honored nobility of arms given to him, he got a rent of only five thousand reis and so he was forced to take the sickle and the hoe [in order to survive], which were more secure and profitable arms, and thus he lived and died in poverty (...)\\" in Pina, 3rd book, chapter CXCI. Heroic deed of Duarte de Almeida, «o decepado» («the mutilated»), a commemorative Portuguese lithography of the battle of Toro (late 19th century). The episode of the Portuguese royal standard, first taken by the Castilians and then retaken by the Portuguese illustrates the confusion of the struggle and the uncertain outcome of the battle of Toro. Most of the Castilian chronicles also confirm the fact that the Castilians lost the Portuguese standard during the battle. However, the Castilian sources are contradictory in the details,Gutiérrez.To read the contradictions among some of the Castilian chronicles about the Portuguese standard: Manchado, pp. 196-198. and one of their chroniclers (Bernaldez) even wrote that the Portuguese ensign was killed, whereas he was captured and later returned to Portugal. In his Chronicle, Pulgar, the official chronicler of the Catholic Monarchs, made an important correction to a previous account that he had provided a few years ago in a letter sent to the city of Murcia, pretending that after the battle, the Castilians owned half of the Portuguese royal standard (after two Castilian chevaliers had divided it into two pieces, one of them lost its part). Then a reward would have been announced and some time later a man with the other half would have appeared, and the two halves formed a whole again. However, it is very implausible that the two men dared to tear apart in two halves such a precious trophy -whose care had been entrusted to them by Cardinal Mendoza himself. Indeed, a few years later, after investigating the episode and many other facts in order to write his Chronicle of the reign of the Catholic Monarchs, Pulgar reviewed this first version and eventually stated plainly that Ferdinand's men simply lost the Portuguese royal standard in the battle of Toro, thus converging his own report with that of the Portuguese chroniclers and increasing its reliability since it included an embarrassing fact: \\"And the standard of the King of Portugal was taken there by the Cardinal and by the men of arms of his guard. (...) And the Cardinal left that place and ordered two knights, Pedro de Velasco and Pero Vaca, to guard the standard, but they lost it again. And eight flags were taken to the Portuguese, which were taken to the city of Zamora. (...) And the Ensign that brought the standard of the King of Portugal was arrested and was taken to Zamora.\\" (Hernando del Pulgar, Crónica de los Reyes Católicos) However, other trophies were involved: in 1922 several academics among them Félix de Llanos y Torriglia studied a Portuguese banner hanging at the Chapel of the New Kings (Toledo's cathedral) and concluded that this banner was probably Castilian and probably from the 14th century (the Battle of Toro was fought during the 15th century).Manchado, p. 282 (footnote 76). In 1945, Orestes Ferrara also investigated the banner and concluded that it couldn't be the Standard carried by Afonso V at the Battle of Toro.Manchado, p. 196 (footnote 134). It is necessary to take into account that several Portuguese banners were captured in the battle (eight, according to Pulgar. Among them, and according to Palencia, was the minor Portuguese royal standard,Palencia, Década III, book XXV, chapter VIII. as traditionally used by the Kings of Castile, which Afonso V assumed to be -and that may have been mistaken by some Castilians as the main Portuguese royal standard.). In their writings, both chroniclers Pulgar and Palencia as well as Ferdinand himself clearly differentiate the Portuguese royal standard from the Portuguese flags. The loss of the Portuguese royal standard can also be demonstrated by its absence: writing during the last year of the war, the Isabela's partisan Bachilar Palma, describes in detail -as an eyewitness-, the triumph ceremony in the Cathedral of Toledo (2 February 1477, only 11 months after the battle), during which the most valuable throphies taken to the Portuguese were dragged to the ground and then hung over the tomb of King John I (whose memory was thus symbolically avenged, since he had lost the Castilian royal standard to the Portuguese in the battle of Aljubarrota, in 1385): only the armour of the Portuguese Alferez and several flags taken to Afonso V were there, but the Portuguese standard is not mentioned.\\"[The Castilian officers] brought with them their flags and those of the nobles ... raised in the air, and the armor of the ensign of the Portuguese adversary, who had been imprisoned in the said battle, placed on a length of spear, and the flags of the mentioned adversary and his [nobles] of Portugal, lowered into the ground … and after the prayer and answer, they offered the armor and flags of their Portuguese adversary, which they had captured in battle, and hung them over the grave of the said king, where they are today. In this way, the dishonor and defeat that King John suffered in the battle of Aljubarrota was avenged.\\" In Palma, chapter XV. Thereby Isabella conceived the remaining fallback solution: an invasion of Portugal led by herself in order to retake the Castilian royal standard lost to the Portuguese on the battle of Aljubarrota. This plan -which was considered inappropriate to her feminine condition by chronicler Palencia and which involved numerous troops from many cities (1477), was soon abandoned.Palencia, Década III, book XXIX, chapter II.Obradó. In addition to the Portuguese chronicles, three Castilian chroniclers corroborate the episode of the recapture of the Portuguese standard – which is thus supported by contemporaneous sources on both sides: Scholar Antonio de Nebrija (Castilian): \\"The Lusitanian standard is captured, which was a valuable insignia, yet by the negligence of Pedro Velasco and Pedro Vaca, to whom it was entrusted, as [already] mentioned, it is subsequently taken up by the enemy.\\"The original Nebrija's statement (in Latin) is quoted by historian Martins, page 207, footnote 34: \\"Captum est Lusitani vexillum cuius erat insigne vultus, sed Petri Veraci et Petri Vaccae ignavia quibus traditum est, ut asseverantur, ab hostribus postea est receptum\\" (Década I, book V, chapter VII). The Nebrija's chronicle is in reality, the translation into Latin (Granada, 1545–1550) of the original Castilian manuscript chronicle of Hernando del Pulgar, with very few Nebrija's addings. This way, the chronicle of Pulgar was published and erroneously attributed to Nebrija (first edition in Castilian, 1565, after the death of Nebrija and Pulgar) by his grandson, also named António de Nebrija. See Tesoros p. 329. Chronicler Garibay (Spanish): \\"The king of Portugal (...) seeing lost, one first time, his Royal standard and captured the ensign, who was taken to Zamora and stripped of his weapons which ...were exposed in the Chapel of the New Kings, Toledo's Church, (...) even though the standard, for negligence (...) was taken by the Portuguese.\\" Royal Cosmographer and Chronicler Pedro de Medina (Castilian): \\"The Castilians invested the Portugal's standard ...and took it easily due to the cowardly and soft resistance from the ensign and its guards. The ensign was captured and later taken to Zamora...but the standard was not taken because...some Portuguese chevaliers regained it after fighting with bravery.\\" Medina, p. 219. In medieval warfare, the royal standard was not a mere flag. Its loss was almost equivalent to losing the battle. The Battle of Toro in numbers =Time= All the chroniclers on both sides agree that the battle began just before sunset, which on March 1 occurs around 7:10 p.m. The fight would have taken between more than an hour (according to Damião de Góis), and far more than 3 hours. This chronicler -referring only to the struggle between both Royal battles-, wrote that \\"The indecisiveness of the outcome lasted for three hours, without victory leaning to either side .\\" But to this, we must add the time required for the prior defeat and chase of the Castilian right wing, the withdrawal of Alfonso V´men and their pursuit during the dark night into Toro −5 km away. =The size of the armies= Both armies had a similar number of men: around 8,000 soldiers. According to Bernaldez, the only chronicler who gives total numbers, the Portuguese army had 8,500 men (3,500 horsemen plus 5,000 peons) while Ferdinand's army had 7,500 men (2,500 horsemen and 5,000 peons) when they left Zamora. So, the Portuguese army had a light advantage of 1,000 horsemen. Bernaldez wrote that the Portuguese army who besieged Zamora had 8,500 men. The siege of this city started in the middle of February 1476 – fifteen daysGóis, chapter LXXV. after the union of the reinforcements brought by the Perfect Prince with the royal army of Afonso V (end of January 1476)Góis, chapter LXXIV. – and continued until the day of the battle (1 March 1476).Thus, 8,500 men is the total number for the combined Portuguese forces at the Battle of Toro since the Portuguese army who fought it was precisely the army who abandoned the Zamora's siege and withdrew to Toro, where it was reached by the former besieged Isabelist army. From this initial number of 8,500 men, it is necessary to discount the losses by desertion, disease,\\"Because.. the place [Zamora] was sickly and the people were much maltreated...\\" Resende, chapter XIII.\\"... during 15 days they [the Juanistas] suffered much rain, cold and snow from which they suffered so much loss...\\" in Góis, chapter LXXVI. and fight during the Zamora's siege, after 15 days of hard winter, putting the final figure in more than 8,000 Luso-Castilians. From the Portuguese side, this number reflects the high desertion suffered by its initial army (14,000 footmen and 5,600 chevaliers – but many of them were used as garrison of strongholds and thus did not fight in the Battle of Toro),After a muster roll in Piedrabuena (Castile) according to Pina, 3rd book, chapter CLXXVII.Góis, chapter L. due to the unpopularity of the war among them. Especially after the failure of Burgos as it is told by Rui de Pina: \\"(...) many Portuguese without the will of serving the King came back to the kingdom [Portugal]\\".Pina, 3rd book, chapter CLXXXIV. The Portuguese captains complained that while they were in Castile, their undefended lands in Portugal were set on fire and looting by the enemy.\\"... Knowing the King D. Afonso how the Castilians made countless attacks in Portugal, without any resistance, [he] agreed with his council that was necessary the return of the Prince to the Kingdom\\" in Góis, chapter LXXXIII. Other reasons were the high losses by disease,Like in Arévalo, when the Luso-Castilians were about to go over Burgos: \\"... many people died...\\" from fevers and other diseases.... Pina, 3rd book, 1902, chapter CLXXX. especially fevers from the hot and also because the Luso-Castilian army included many Castilian contingents who easily and massively changed sides after the aborted expedition to Burgos and its consequent fall on 28 January 1476. From all the great Castilian nobles who initially supported Juana, only the Archbishop of Toledo, Alfonso Carillo de Acuña was at the side of Afonso V on the day of the battle. After all, despite the reinforcement troopsZurita: \\"[Afonso V] was at Toro [waiting for the imminent reinforcements of the Prince] with so few people that they were less than 800 chevaliers\\" in volume VIII, book XIX, chapter XXXIX. brought by Prince John, when the Battle of Toro was fought, the invader army had suffered the erosion of 10 months of permanency in enemy territory. Álvaro Lopes de Chaves, the most nationalist of the Portuguese chroniclers, wrote that the Castilian army had a small advantage of 700 to 800 chevaliers over the Portuguese army. Pulgar Corroborates the similar size of both armies: \\"... there was little difference in the number of horsemen between both armies.\\" According to Zurita this difference in horsemen between both armies was 500 men.... (volume VIII, book XIX, chapter XLIV), and to Bernaldez it was 1,000 men (chapter XXIII). The high numbers involving dozens of thousands of men on each army as it is mentioned in some modern records of the Battle of Toro not only do not have documentary support but are also in direct contradiction with the Historical record: the contemporaneous chronicler Andreas Bernaldez, being a Castilian and a partisan of the Catholic Monarchs, cannot therefore be accused of pulling down the numbers of the armies present at the battlefield to reduce the triumph of his King Ferdinand at Toro. Bernaldez is also corroborated by the partial numbers of the late chronicler Zurita for the horsemen of both armies: 3,000 chevaliers to Ferdinand and 3,500 chevaliers to Afonso V. =Losses= The total number of losses (dead and prisoners) was probably similar in both armies (but larger among the Juanistas) and wouldn't have been higher than one thousand men among the Portuguese-Castilians and many hundreds for the Isabelistas. While Diego de Valera estimates 800 dead, Bernaldez mentions about 1,200 Portuguese dead (that's the version high Portuguese losses and low Castilian losses). But the version of great Portuguese losses / great Castilian losses is much more credible, not only because it is the only one supported by the sources of both sides (Pulgar and Á. Lopes de Chaves), but also because Bernaldez is contradicted by no less than six chroniclers (three Castilian and three Portuguese) who explicitly stated that the Castilian losses were high: Pulgar, Esteban de Garibay y Zamalloa,\\"(...) [The Castilians] were driven back with many dead by the artillery and javelin throwers from the Portuguese infantry (...).\\" In Garibay, book 18, chapter VII, p. 597. Pedro de Medina,Medina: \\"… a huge number of Castilians promptly fell dead and was necessary to remove another crowd of wounded men.\\" pp. 218–219. Garcia de Resende,\\"...with great loss (...).\\" In Resende, chapter XIII. A. Lopes Chaves and Damião de Góis.(\\"... [The Castilians] started running away and our men killed and imprisoned many of them, and from those who escaped...\\" in Góis, chapter LXXVIII, p. 298- 299. Pulgar states: \\"(...) and many were killed in one side and on the other side (...).\\" Álvaro Lopes de Chaves, also an eyewitness of the campaign, adds:\\"(...) and on the battle there were many dead, prisoners and wounded in one side and on the other side.\\" As for prisoners, the available numbers are even scarcer. Chronicler Palencia wrote that when Afonso V returned to the city of Toro in the days immediately after the battle, he had wasted \\"an opportunity of stabbing or drowning in the river 500 enemies both infantry and chivalry [Castilian prisoners inside Toro]\\".,Palencia, Década III, book XXV, chapter IX. which would certainly be a revenge over men who had contributed to his defeat in the battle. Like all numbers related to the battle of Toro, there are no certainties, and this number of 500 Castilian prisoners should be considered as a maximum and possibly inflated. The losses were relatively large comparing to the size of the armies in presence, but according to chronicler Juan de Mariana they were low in terms of absolute value for a battle with this political importance: \\"The killing was small compared with the victory, and even the number of captives was not large\\". Besides the chronicles, there is additional evidence pointing to low losses in the Battle of Toro: during the Lisbon courts of 1476, the procurators of Évora called the attention of Prince John to the strong contingent given by the city to his father's army. This was natural because Évora was the second most populous Portuguese city of the 15th century. Sociedade e população dos descobrimentos , Infopédia, Enciclopédia e Dicionários, Porto Editora, Oporto, 2003–2011. What is not expectable is that only 17 men from that contingent had died in the Battle of Toro,\\"... with the arms on the backs, spending our money (...) risking the life for your service in such a way that if you lord look for, you will find that from this city died on the battle seventeen men (...)\\" speech of the Evora's procurators at the courts of 1476, in Pereira, pp. 9-10. as the same procurators proudly declared. This number only makes sense if we accept that the Portuguese fatalities in battle were low. Aftermath and consequences From a military perspective the Battle of Toro was inconclusiveCusatelli, p. 267: \\"The battle of Toro between Portuguese and Castilians had an uncertain outcome; but at the end [of the war] Alfonso had to subscribe the Peace of Alcáçovas (4 September 1479).\\" but politically the outcome was the same as it would have been if the battle was a military victory for the Catholic Monarchs, because all its fruits have fallen by their side.As noted by Fernández, p. 156: \\"(...) in the situation created, Afonso V needed an evident triumph; it was not enough for him to not be defeated.\\"Zurita in Volume VIII, book XIX, chapter XLIV, wrote in a lucid way that \\"In spite of whatever happened [at the Battle of Toro] where the adversary [the Portuguese] also claimed victory, this battle ended the war (...) becoming the Sicilia's King [Ferdinand]... King of Castile.\\" Isabella convoked courts at Madrigal where her daughter was proclaimed and sworn heiress of Castile's throne (April 1476). Madonna of the Catholic Monarchs, by Fernando Gallego, c. 1490–95. After the battle, Afonso V – who wanted to avoid the renovation of the truces between France and Aragon, which would expire in July 1476Mendonça, p. 81. – became convinced that Portugal wouldn't be able to impose his niece's rights to the Castile's throne without external aid. So he departed to France seeking for help. The combined resources of Castile and Aragon had a population five times biggerIn 1499: \\"1 million souls\\" in Portugal... Rodrigues, p .21.In 1480: 4.5 million in Castile plus 840,000 in Aragon (total: 5.34 million) in Tutorformación, chapter 5, p. 93. and an area five times larger than that of Portugal. Many nobles still loyal to Juana since the Burgos episode turned sides along the next months and years – like the Portocarrero and Pacheco-Girón families plus the hesitant Marquis of Cadiz – and the majority of the undecided cities and castles would bound to the Isabella's party specially the fortress of Zamora, Madrid and other places from the Central region of Castile. It was a very slow but irreversible process. However, the bulk\\"The Prince left the King in the Holy Week [Easter of 1476: first days of April] with very few people because the most of the people... stayed with the King.\\" In Góis, chapter LXXXIII.\\"... and with him [Prince John] the count of Penela... and few more people because the majority of the men stayed at Toro with the King.\\" in Pina, 3rd book, 1902, chapter CXCII (\\"How the Prince came back to Portugal and what the King D. Afonso did during that time in Castile\\"). of the Portuguese army stayed in Castile with Afonso V and JuanaJuana, la \\"Beltraneja\\", returned to Portugal with her husband Afonso V (and not with prince John as erroneously wrote Juan de Mariana 120 years after the Battle of Toro, and thus a more distant source) just in time to celebrate the feast of the Corpus Christi at Miranda do Douro (in the frontier): Pina, 3rd book, 1902, chapter CXCIII, (\\"How was decided the King's trip to France and he came back to Portugal with the queen D. Joana\\").Góis, chapter LXXXVIII (\\"How the King D. Alfonso returned to Portugal together with his wife d.

Rui de Pina and Damião de Góis wrote that only a small fraction of the Portuguese troops returned to Portugal with the Perfect Prince – one month after the battle, first daysFernández, p. 158. of April 1476 (Easter) – to organize the resistance of the undefended Portuguese frontier from the continuous Castilian attacks. According to Juan de Mariana they were only 400 horsemen.400 horsemen: Mariana, book XXIV, chapter XI, p. 302. In spite of having been weakened by the countless defections from the Juanistas to the Isabelistas, the Portuguese troops maintained a winning attitude especially in the district of Salamanca (and later around Toro), conqueringGóis, chapter LXXXVII (\\"...and the destruction that king D.

Góis clarifies that when the Castilian siege to Cantalapiedra finally ended, Afonso V having reached its objective, returned from the lands of Salamanca to Toro. In this city he learned with regret that the Castilian forces that had recently besieged Cantalapiedra had been sent to Salamanca – because he had lost this way an opportunity to fight a battle with them. and burning many castles and villages. The Portuguese army even organized two large military expeditions to captureGóis, Chapter LXXXIV (\\"... about an ambush set up by King D. Alfonso to King D.

King Ferdinand and then Queen Isabella (April 1476). After the Battle of Toro Ferdinand's reinforced army did not attack the invading army, but with less risk besieged the Juanista strongholds (successfully even at length thanks to a clever policy of forgiveness) while negotiating with the rebel hidalgos. The Catholic Monarchs' strategy proved to be right because time and resources were on their side: the terrible military pressureMoreno, pp. 103-116. exercised over the Portuguese border lands (which defensive forces were in Castile at the service of Afonso V) together with the new front of the naval warfare (Isabella decided to attack the Portuguese at the heart of their power – the sea and the gold of Guinea)Mendonça, pp. 79, 98–99. made inevitable the return of the Portuguese army to Portugal. Diplomatic solution at Alcáçovas After the Battle of Toro the war continued, especially by sea (the Portuguese reconquest of CeutaPina, 3rd book, chapter CXCIV (Editorial error: Chapter CXCIV erroneously appears as Chapter CLXIV).Quesada, p. 98.

This victory allowed the Perfect Prince to use the Canary Islands as an \\"exchange coin\\" for the Portuguese monopoly of navigation and commerce in all the Atlantic south of those islands, in the peace treaty of Alcáçovas. and the decisive naval Battle of GuineaBattle of Guinea: Palencia, Década IV, Book XXXIII, Chapter V ( \\"Disaster among those sent to the mines of gold [Guinea]. Charges against the King...\\"), p.91-94. This was a decisive battle because after it and in spite of the Catholic Monarchs' attempts, they were unable to send new fleets to Guinea, Canary or to any part of the Portuguese empire until the end of the War. The Perfect Prince sent an order to drown any Castilian crew captured in Guinea waters. Even the Castilian navies which left to Guinea before the signature of the peace treaty had to pay the tax (\\"quinto\\") to the Portuguese crown when returned to Castile after the peace treaty. Isabella had to ask permission to Afonso V so that this tax could be paid in Castilian harbours. Naturally all this caused grudge against the Catholic Monarchs in Andalusia.), but also in Castilian and Portuguese soil. In 1477 a force of 2,000 Castilian knights commanded by the master of Santiago, Alonso de Cárdenas who invaded the Alentejo (Portugal) is defeatedBattle of Mourão: Resende, chapter XVI, \\"How the Prince conquered Alegrete and how he beat off the Master of Santiago who intended to attack Évora with 2,000 chevaliers\\".Góis, chapter XCVI, p. 361-365. near Mourão: more than 100 Castilian knights were captured and the others fled, according to the chroniclers Garcia de Resende and Damião de Góis. In 1479, the same master of Santiago defeats at AlbueraBattle of Albuera: Pulgar, chapter LXXXVII. a force of 700 or 1,000 (depending on the sources) Portuguese and allied Castilians who had invaded Extremadura (Castile) to help the rebel cities of Medellin and Mérida. According to Alfonso de Palencia the Portuguese-Castilians had 85 knights killedPalencia, Decada IV, book 34, chapter 2. and few prisoners,The prisoners were qualitatively important since all the Portuguese captains were captured: Pulgar, chapter LXXXVII, p.153. (see next footnote) but the bulk...however the number of prisoners was very low: \\" (...) -with the only exception of those killed on the fight [of Albuera]- all the others reached [Mérida]...\\" in Palencia, Decada IV, book XXXIV, chapter 3. Sometimes the clash of Albuera is presented as a \\"decisive battle\\" which would have forced Portugal to ask for peace and thus ending the war (because the peace negotiations started few days later). But it is highly unlikely that a fight so reduced in size, with so few losses, and which didn't even prevent the Portuguese from achieving their strategic objectives (reach and maintain until the war's end the allied cities of Mérida and Medellin) had forced Portugal whatsoever. After all, more important than the start of the peace negotiations is the date the war ended: more than half a year after Albuera, on September 4, 1479. of that force reached those two cities where they resisted to fierce sieges by Ferdinand's forces until the end of the conflict,\\"... [The Portuguese of Merida and Medellin] resisted during the entire summer until the peace treaty...\\" in Pina, 3rd book, chapter CCV.\\"This way was dated and signed the peace (...). And the sieges to the fortresses [Merida and Mededellin] were immediately raised\\" in Pulgar, chapter CXI, page 158. and thus increasing the bargaining power of Portugal during the peace negotiations and keeping the war's gravity centre inside Castile and out of doors. Except for those two cities on Extremadura and a few other places (Tui, Azagala, Ferrera and Montánchez),\\"...and the negotiations [Treaty of Alcáçovas] concerning the restituition of the [Castilian] fortresses of Azagala, Tuy, and Ferrera...\\" in Costa, p. 34. all the other strongholds occupied by the Portuguese in Castile ( Zamora, Toro and Cantalapiedra) as well as those occupied by their allied castiliansFernández, p. 278. (Castronuño, Sieteiglesias, Cubillas Villalonso, Portillo, Villaba) surrendered. Nevertheless, all the strongholds occupied by the Castilians in Portugal (Ouguela, Alegrete and Noudar)Resende, chapters X and XV. were retaken by Prince John. The exit from this impasse was reached through negotiations: the naval victory on the warNewitt, pp. 39, 40: \\"However, in 1478 the Portuguese surprised thirty-five Castilian ships returning from Mina [Guinea] and seized them and all their gold. Another...Castilian voyage to Mina, that of Eustache de la Fosse, was intercepted ... in 1480. (...) All things considered, it is not surprising that the Portuguese emerged victorious from this first maritime colonial war. They were far better organised than the Castilians, were able to raise money for the preparation and supply of their fleets and had clear central direction from ... [Prince] John.\\"Diffie et al., p. 152, \\"In a war in which the Castilians were victorious on land and the Portuguese at sea...\\". allowed Portugal to negotiate its acquittal to the Castilian throne at the exchangeGuerrero, p.49: \\"...[with the Peace treaty of Alcáçovas, 1479] the Catholic monarchs find themselves forced to abandon their expansion by the Atlantic...\\". It would be Columbus who would free Castile from this difficult situation of blocked overseas expansion, because his New World discovery led to a new and much more balanced sharing of the Atlantic at Tordesilhas in 1494. The orders received by Columbus in his first voyage (1492) are elucidative: \\"...[the Catholic Monarchs] have always in mind that the limits signed in the \\"share\\" of Alcáçovas should not be overcome, and thus they insist with Columbus to sail along the parallel of Canary.\\"Armas wrote that at Alcáçovas, the Catholic monarchs \\"buy the peace at an excessively expensive price...\\", p. 88. With the Alcáçovas treaty, the Portuguese reached its ultimate goal: Castile – the only nation able to compete with Portugal in the ultramarine expansion – was practically \\"out\\" of the Atlantic and also deprived from the gold of Guinea (where it occurred the battle of Guinea, 1478). of a very favourable share of the Atlantic and possessions. On the other side, months before the start of peace negotiations the Catholic Monarchs reached two great victories: The acknowledgement of Isabella as Queen of Castile by the French King (treaty of Saint-Jean-de-Luz on 9 October 1478), who broke this way the alliance with Afonso V, leaving Portugal isolated facing Castile and Aragon.Mendonça, p. 91. The Pope Sixtus IV, changing his position, revoked the former bull authorizing Juana's marriage with her uncle Afonso V. This way, the legitimacy of Afonso V as King of Castile fell by its foundations. The final balance of the war became very similar to the one of the Battle of Toro, without a conclusive victory to none of the sides: Castilian victory on the land and a Portuguese victory on the seas. In the peace Treaty of Alcáçovas, everybody won: Isabella was recognized Castile's Queen (in exchange for her acquittal to the Portuguese crown and the payment of a big war compensation to Portugal: 106.676 dobles of gold)Mendonça, pp. 102, 103. and Portugal won the exclusive domain of the navigation and commerce in all the Atlantic Ocean except for the Canary Islands (in exchange for its eventual rights over those islands which remained to Castile). Portugal also reached the exclusive conquest right over the Kingdom of Fez (Morocco). Only D. Juana, la \\"Beltraneja\\" or \\"the Excellent Lady\\", has lost a lot as she saw her rights sacrificed to the Iberian states' interests. Propaganda San Juan de los Reyes. It was a key monument of the propagandistic architecture of the Battle of Toro. The argument of victory was based on a very intuitive syllogism: If there was a battle at Toro and if Isabella was proclaimed Queen of Castile, so that implied that she had won it. The complex and polemic Battle of Toro was this way presented as a black and white picture, and the entire War reduced to its dynastic dimension ignoring its naval and colonial component. As the Spanish academic Ana Isabel Carrasco Manchado summarized: \\"The battle [of Toro] was fierce and uncertain, and because of that both sides attributed themselves the victory. (...). Both wanted to take advantage of the victory's propaganda.\\" Both sides used it. However, Isabella demonstrated a superior political intelligence and clearly won the propaganda's war around the result of the battle of Toro: during a religious ceremony at the Toledo's cathedral (2 February 1477), Isabella – who already had proclaimed herself Queen of Portugal – hung the military trophies taken from the Portuguese (flags and the armour of the ensign) at the tomb of her great grandfather Juan I, as a posthumous revenge for the terrible disaster of Aljubarrota.Manchado, pp. 279-282. Since then the chroniclers of the Catholic Monarchs followed the official version that the Battle of Toro (1476) was a victory which represented a divine retribution for the battle of Aljubarrota (1385): one of the chroniclers (Alonso Palma, in 1479) put it exactly as the title of his chronicle –\\"La Divina retribución sobre la caída de España en tiempo del noble rey Don Juan el Primero\\"Palma. (\\"Divine retribution for the defeat of Spain during the time of the noble King D. John the first\\"). After the letterManchado, p. 136. sent in 1475 by Pulgar -whose chronicle seems to have been personally reviewed by Isabella,Tesoros, p.329. Pulgar (who was dismissed from royal chronicler after being criticized by the Inquisitor Torquemada for defending the Marranos) also saw his masterpiece censured: Claros varones de Castilla. to Afonso V (invoking Aljubarrota, where \\"(...) fell that crowd of Castilians (...) killed\\"), the theme became recurrent. This is well exemplified by Palencia, who not only frequently mentions Aljubarrota but also refers to the expedition that was planned by the inner circle of Isabella to send a great Castilian force to penetrate deeply into Portugal in order to recover the Castilian royal standard taken by the Portuguese at the Battle of Aljubarrota one hundred years before. There were many volunteers –hidalgos and cities like Seville, Jerez, Carmona, Écija, Cordova, and Badajoz. All this because, according to Palencia, this standard symbolized the \\"(...) eternal shame of our people\\" for the Castilian defeat at Aljubarrota.Manchado, p. 290. This obsession with Aljubarrota clearly influenced the descriptions of the Battle of Toro in the Castilian chronicles. It is important to the modern historical critic of the Battle of Toro to differentiate the facts from the official propaganda of the 15th and 16th centuries and to confront these records with those of the enemy side: for example with the chapter \\"How the Prince won the Battle of Toro and remained in the battlefield without contradiction\\" from the chronicle \\"Life and deeds of King D. John II\\" of the Portuguese chronicler Garcia de Resende. Besides literature, architecture was also used for propaganda and was influenced by Aljubarrota. The construction of the Monastery of San Juan de los Reyes (to celebrate the battle of Toro and the birth of Prince John) was mainly a response to the Monastery of the Battle,\\"the initiative of the edification of this monastery [S. Juan de los Reyes] was one way more to overcome in a triumphal sense the parallelism with that battle of Aljubarrota, which was commemorated in Portugal with the construction of the Battle's monastery. (...) initially conceived as a royal pantheon (like the Portuguese one)...\\" in Manchado, p. 283. built by the Portuguese to commemorate Aljubarrota, and like the Portuguese one it was also conceived to be a royal pantheon. On the other side, the Portuguese chroniclers focused their attention on the victory of the Perfect Prince instead of the defeat of his King, Afonso V. And they also presented the Portuguese invasion of Castile as a just cause because it was made in the defence of the legitimate Queen against a \\"usurper\\" – Isabella. In addition to the documents, there are also important indicators in assessing the outcome of the battle of Toro, like the attitude and behaviour of both armies in the weeks immediately after the battle, the invading army's length of stay in enemy territory, and even comparisons with other similar battles. The Battle of Toro as retribution to Aljubarrota The Battle of Toro is frequently presented as a twin battle (with opposite sign) of the Battle of Aljubarrota. Politically the comparison is legitimate: both of them were Royal Battles which decided the fate of some Peninsular Kingdoms in a way that would prove to be favourable to the nationalist party. But on military terms the difference is largeBarata, pp. 3-4. It is possible to compare the list of great nobles killed in the battles of Toro and Aljubarrota: Zurita gives a list of 3 Portuguese nobles (Volume VIII, book XIX, chapter XLIV) killed at the Battle of Toro whereas Lopes presents a list of 43 great nobles from the Juan's I army killed at Aljubarrota (Cronica de D. João I (2), chapter XLIV). Besides Afonso V's defeat, Pulgar reports that a part of the Portuguese army (his left side led by the Perfect Prince) defeated during the Battle of Toro a part of the Isabelista army: its right side, and he gives a justification for that. That's corroborated by all the four Portuguese chroniclers, and also by Zurita and Mariana, who respectively added that, after this, the Prince's forces remained \\"always in good order\\", and \\"without suffering defeat\\", during the whole battle (or \\"intact\\", according to Pedro de Medina).Castilian chronicler Medina, pp. 218–219: \\"...[The men of Afonso V disbanded, in spite of] having on their [left] side their Prince intact and with good troops....\\" This chronicler even showed himself amazed that Prince John had not aided his father, which is an admission that he remained unbroken. The Portuguese- Castilians became masters of the battlefield according to all the Portuguese chroniclers and also to Pulgar, Bernaldez and Mariana who revealed that \\"the Portuguese sustained their positions during more time\\". Both Kings Ferdinand and Afonso left the battlefield of Toro (to Zamora and Castronuño respectively) in the night of the battle according to all chroniclers of both sides and the Portuguese recovered its lost royal standard. Battle of Aljubarrota, 1385: a constant shadow in the historic memory of the Catholic Monarchs chroniclers, who like all the new dynasties after a civil war, needed a \\"foundational myth\\". The Battle of Toro was the perfect choice: it reflected the God's will and was presented as a victory that avenged Aljubarrota. At the Battle of Aljubarrota all the parts of the Franco-Castilian army were defeated: vanguard,Froissart, folios 239v, 240r, 240v, 241r. royal battleFroissart, folios 241r, 241v, 242r. and right wing.Lopes, chapter XLIV. At the end of the battle, the only Castilian soldiers present at the battlefield were deadIllustrative was the answer given by the Portuguese King John I to his scouts when they returned on the next morning and informed him that there were no enemies around the Aljubarrota battlefield except of course countless Castilian corpses: \\"Of them we need not be afraid\\" in Froissart, folio 242v. or imprisoned, and the Portuguese King plus his army remained there for 3 days.\\"The [Portuguese] king stayed 3 days on the camp, as is tradition in such battles...\\" in Lopes, chapter XLV, pages 118, 119. The Castilian royal standard was taken to Lisbon and 12 hours12 hours: Lopes, chapter XLIII, tells that Juan I fled from the battlefield of Aljubarrota towards Santarém at the sunset and then he left Santarém at dawn of the next day in a boat arriving to Lisbon where he got refuge in his fleet. He registered the arriving hour of the King: hora tertia which corresponds roughly to the third hour of the day after dawn. The timing for hora tertia depended on the latitude and day of year. At Rome's latitude (practically the same of Aljubarrota) hora tertia was, at the summer solstice, 06:58 to 08:13. after the battle Juan I left Portuguese soil taking refuge in his mighty armada which was besieging Lisbon (3 daysLopes, chapter XLIII. later he sailed towards Castile) – while his entire army fled to Castile in the hours immediatelyLopes, chapter XLIX.Ayala, 7th year, chapter XV.The French- Aragonese army led by the heir prince of Navarre, Charles – who was advancing at top speed to help Juan I in the battle of Aljubarrota – fled from Portugal to Castile as soon as he heard the news about the disaster. Ayala, 7th year, chapter XVI. after the battle. The Portuguese army invaded Castile and defeated a large Castilian army in the Battle of Valverde (mid October 1385).Lopes, chapters LIV, LV, LVI and LVII.Ayala, 7th year, chapter XVIII. After the Battle of Toro, the Afonso's V army stayed in Castile months where it launched several offensives especially in the Salamanca's district and later around Toro. For that he was criticized by chronicler Damião de Góis: \\"[Afonso V] never stopped to make raids and horse attacks along the land, acting more like a frontier's captain than like a King as it was convenient to his royal person.\\" Shortly after the Battle of Toro (April 1476), the Portuguese army organized two large military operations to capture first King Ferdinand himself (during the siege to Cantalapiedra) and then Queen Isabella (among Madrigal and Medina del Campo). As noted by historian L. Miguel Duarte,Mattoso, pp. 390-391. this is not the behaviour of a defeated army. On the other side, the Castilian army during those 3 months after the Battle of Toro, in spite of its numerical advantage – with the massive transferences from the Juanistas to the Isabelistas plus the departure of some troops back to Portugal with Prince John – and despite of being impelled in his own territory, it neither offered a second battle nor attacked the invading army. This behaviour and attitude is an elucidative indicator of the outcome of the Battle of Toro. There is also a number gap. In the Battle of Toro the proportion of both armies was practically 1:1, according to Bernaldez (7,500 Juanistas to 8,500 Isabelistas), Álvaro L Chaves and Pulgar, whereas at Aljubarrota that proportion was 5:1 according to Fernão Lopes (31,000 Franco- Castilians to 6,500 Anglo-Portuguese)Lopes, chapters XXXVI and XXXVII. The army brought from Castile was enlarged on its way towards Aljubarrota with the forces from the many cities and fortresses loyal to Juan I, commanded by their respective alcaldes plus a large contingent from the Castilian armada which was besieging Lisbon reaching: 6,000 men at arms plus 15,000 peons plus 2,000 jennets and 8,000 javelin throwers. or \\"at least 4:1\\"Froissart, folio 237r. according to Jean Froissart. Elucidative is the attitude of the Castilian chronicler Pero López de Ayala, who besides being a military expert and a royal counsellor, participated on the Battle of Aljubarrota: he described minuciously the disposition and the numbers of the Anglo-Portuguese army but understandably he didn't say a word about the soldiers' number of his own army.Ayala, 7th year: chapters XIII and XIV. Ayala was captured after the battle. In the Battle of Toro the casualties (dead and prisoners) were similar in both armies according to Pulgar and Álvaro L. Chaves and were low to J. Mariana. According to Diego de Valera the Portuguese suffered 800 dead while Bernaldez, who doesn't quantify the Castilian losses, gives a total of 1,200 dead to the Portuguese. At Aljubarrota, Fernão Lopes reveals that the Castilians lost 2,500 men at arms Plus a \\"huge crowd\\" of \\"little people\\", men without a (noble) name (foot men, javelin throwers, jennets) and in the subsequent 24 hours the fugitives suffered a terrible bloodbath in the neighbouring villages at the hands of the local.Lopes, chapters XLIV and XLV. The so-called \\"monk of Westminster\\", who wrote near 1390 possibly recording the testimony of English participants in the battle of Aljubarrota, puts the total losses (common people and men at arms) at more than 7,500 dead.WestministerRussel, p. 431. (to Froissart they were 7 to 8 thousand dead500 knights and 500 squids killed plus \\"... six or seven thousand other men\\" killed, in Froissart, folio 242r.). As for the prisoners, Ximenes de Sandoval, the great Aljubarrota Spanish expert, estimated in his classic workSandoval. the grand total for the Franco-Castilian losses: 10,000 men: 3,000 dead on the battlefield plus 3,000 dead on the near villages and 4,000 prisoners. Only losses of this magnitude could justify the national mourning decreed by Juan I –which lasted two yearsThe national mourning started in the Valladolid Courts (1385 December) until the Briviesca Courts (December 1387) in Russel, pp. 433, 439,440 and 533–535. – and also the prohibition to participate in any public and private feast during that time:All public and private diversions forbidden in Russel, p. 433. \\"Nowadays, our kingdom has suffered such great loss of so many and so important Knights like those who died on the present war [with Portugal] and also because in this time came such great dishonour and ruin to everyone of our kingdom that it is great the pain and shame residing in our heart.\\"Cortes, p. 331.Russel, p. 439. (Juan I at the Valladolid courts −1385, December). Ten daysSpeech of Cardinal Mendoza: \\"... It would be deshuman... 10 days after the battle...\\" in Pulgar, chapter XLVII, page 91. after the Battle of Toro, a few Portuguese desertersDeserters, not fugitives: Martins, p. 224. were imprisoned when they tried to reach Portugal through Sayago, on the frontier, and some of them were killed or castrated. Desertion among the Portuguese was very high before the Battle of Toro, especially after the Burgos episode, and after this battle the number increased: \\"And many of the Portuguese that left the battle returned to Portugal whether on foot or by horse.\\", wrote Pulgar. When some Portuguese proposed to buy a free transit document (one silver royal for each man) to avoid fighting, the Cardinal Mendoza counselled Ferdinand to send an order to spare any prisoner and to not offer resistance to those Portuguese who tried to cross the frontier, because other way, they would have no alternative except to fight and thereby prolonging the war and destruction inside Castile: \\"when this was known to the King, it was debated in his council if they should permit the returning of the Portuguese to Portugal in security. Some chevaliers and other men from the King's army whose sons and brothers and relatives were killed and wounded on the battle (...) worked to provoke the King (...). And brought into the King's memory the injuries and the cruel deaths inflicted by the Portuguese to the Castilians in the battle of Aljubarrota (...).The cardinal of Spain said: (...) Pero Gonzalez de Mendoza my great grandfather, lord of Aleva, was killed on that so called battle of Aljubarrota (...) and in the same way perished some of my relatives and many of Castile's important personalities. (...) do not think in revenge (...). It is sure that if the passage was made impossible for those [Portuguese] who go, they will be forced to stay in your kingdoms, making war and bad things (...). After hearing the cardinal's reasons, the King sent an order to not preclude the passage of the Portuguese, and to not cause them harm in any way.\\" (Pulgar). It was a variant of the principle attributed to Sun Tzu: \\"when enemy soldiers leave your country cover them with gold\\", except that in this case it was the enemy soldiers who left silver in Castilian territory in exchange for their free transit. This situation of the Portuguese deserters trying to cross the frontier by their own risk, several days after the Battle of Toro, is not comparable to the bloodbath suffered by the Castilian fugitives at the hands of the population in the 24 hours after the Battle of Aljubarrota. After all, those Portuguese deserters had some capability to make war and antagonize the Castilians who might try to capture them (as Cardinal Mendoza himself admitted), whereas near the Aljubarrota battlefield the Castilian soldiers' thought was to survive the carnage. Their bargaining power and silver were useless. In the Portuguese historiography and imaginary, the Battle of Toro wasn't considered a defeat but an inconclusive engagement or even a victory – and not just exclusively in Portugal,Thomas p. 1279: \\"JOHN (JOÃO) II, King of Portugal, surnamed THE PERFECT (...), five years later gained the battle of Toro over the Castilians\\".Richebourg p. 198: \\"(...) though the Portuguese had undoubtedly won [the battle of Toro], King Ferdinand got all the advantages. (...) there are victories that are disadvantageous to the winners, and defeats that are useful to the defeated.\\"Blake: \\"JOHN II, King of Portugal (...). He subsequently defeated the Castilians at the battle of Toro, in 1476\\", p. 661. especially for those of the 15th to the 18th centuries. In Castile the Battle of Aljubarrota was considered a national tragedy: Castilian chronicler Álvaro Garcia de Santa María reports that during the peace negotiations at 1431 (as late as nearly half a century after Aljubarrota) the members of the Castilian royal council didn't want to sign the peace treaty and offered a hard resistance because many of them \\"have lost their grandfathers, or fathers or uncles or relatives in the battle of Aljubarrota and wanted to avenge the great loss they had suffered on that occasion\\"Álvar Garcia de Santa Maria- Crónica de Juan II, 1431, Biblioteca de Autores Españoles 68, chapters 4, 16 and 25. The peace treaty with Portugal was signed at last at Medina del Campo (1431), but without neither the payment of war compensation nor the obligation of military assistance, as demanded by Castile. \\"Revenge\\" would finally come two centuries after Aljubarrota at the Battle of Alcântara (1580) when a Spanish army defeated the Portuguese supporters of António, Prior of Crato and incorporated Portugal into the Iberian Union. A royal letter contradicted by the chroniclers The letter written and sent by Ferdinand to the cities of Castile in the day after the battle of Toro (claiming victory), although contradicted by his own chroniclers in many ways, is a masterpiece of political propaganda, and it is in line with his practical concept of truth, later disclosed by himself in another event: \\"The King of France complains that I have twice deceived him. He lies, the fool; I have deceived him ten times and more.\\"\\"... such deception and avarice was a fact of life in fifteenth-century Europe. Ferdinand V worked overtime in the practice of falsity. (…) Indeed, Ferdinand relished in his effective use of deceit and mendacity to gain the upper hand over his foes …This was a befitting attribute …\\" in Malveaux, p. 550. examples where his account is contradicted not only by Portuguese chroniclers but also by his own chroniclers are the death of the Portuguese standard-bearer Duarte de Almeida; the complete omissions of Prince John´s victory over his right wing, the retreat of his remaining forces when faced by prince John in the battlefield (Pulgar, Bernandez, and Juan de Mariana ), and the recovery of the royal standard by the Portuguese (Nebrija,\\"The Lusitanian standard is captured, which was a valuable insignia, yet by the negligence of Pedro Velasco and Pedro Vaca, to whom it was entrusted, as [already] mentioned, it is subsequently taken up by the enemy.\\" Pedro de Medina,\\"The Castilians invested the Portugal's standard ...and took it easily due to the cowardly and soft resistance from the ensign and its guards. The ensign was captured and later taken to Zamora...but the standard was not taken because...some Portuguese chevaliers regained it after fighting with bravery.\\" In Medina, p. 219. and Garibay \\"The king of Portugal (...) seeing lost, one first time, his Royal standard and captured the ensign, who was taken to Zamora and stripped of his weapons which ...were exposed in the Chapel of the New Kings, Toledo's Church, (...) even though the standard, for negligence (...) was taken by the Portuguese.\\" In Garibay, book 18, chapter VIII). Niccolò Machiavelli nello studio, Stefano Ussi, 1894. Machiavelli was a great admirer of Ferdinand's methods, whom he praised as \\"the foremost king in Christendom\\" \\"Machiavelly carefully studied Ferdinand's career, relished his cunning, praised his 'deeds … all great and some extraordinary', and called him 'the foremost king in Christendom.'\\" in Durant, p. 206. He also omitted his personal withdrawal from the battlefield before his own army (Pulgar), and pretended that after the battle he remained on the ground ruling the field for three or four hours, which is impossible, given the timing provided by the Castilian chroniclers: according to Pulgar's timing, the battle must have ended around 11:00 p.m. (all chroniclers of both sides agree that it started at sunset –around 7:00 p.m.- and to the 3 hours of indecisive fight between both royal battles, as reported by Pulgar, we must add the time required for the prior defeat and chase of the Castilian right wing, the withdrawal of Alfonso V´men, their pursuit during the dark night into Toro −5 km away– and the looting of the field). Thus, if Ferdinand had remained on the field for 3 or 4 hours after the end of the battle, it implies that he would have started the journey back to Zamora between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m., –a length journey of more than 22 km across the mountains in the middle of a very dark and rainny night, after an exhausting battle of many hours and carrying spoils– which would have taken several hours to complete. Since Ferdinand stated that he reached Zamora at 1:00 a.m., it is impossible that he remained on the battlefield as long as he wrote (his arrival could not have occurred before his departure). Besides this, the Castilian royal chronicler Pulgar explicitly states that Ferdinand promptly withdraw into Zamora (before cardinal Mendoza, the duke of Alba and his men), and attempted to justify this by implying that the night was dark enough to prevent the Castilians of attacking Prince John -who was in front of them on the battlefield, but not dark enough to avoid an attack from the Portuguese garrison of Toro to the distant city of Zamora (29,2 km in straight way, but farther through the mountains)–which was the reason he gave for explaining the abrupt Ferdinand's retreat from the battlefield,\\"... against who [Prince John] the Spain's cardinal as well as the Duke of Alba intended to go with some men that they were able to collect from those returned from the chase and from those who were spread around the camp … and they couldn´t move them, because the night was so dark that they [the Castilians] couldn't neither see nor recognize each other and because the men were so tired and haven't eaten all day as they left Zamora by morning. The King [Ferdinand] promptly returned to the city of Zamora [\\"volvió luego\\"] because he was told that people from the King of Portugal, located in the city of Toro on the other side of the river, could attack the \\"estanzas\\" he left besieging the Zamora's fortress. And the cardinal and the duke of Alba stayed on the battlefield gathering the men and returned with them to the city of Zamora. \\" In Pulgar, chapter XLV. against all chivalric custom of the time (Sessio Triduana). Also, the report of the Castilian chronicler Palencia shows that Ferdinand can't have been so long on the camp, after the battle, since he wrote that Ferdinand left the battlefield at 9:00 p.m.Palencia, II, book XXV, chapter IX, p. 272. –at a time when the battle, according to the timing given by Pulgar, was still undecided (his departure before the end of the battle is also supported by the Portuguese chroniclers). Indeed, if Ferdinand had remained 3 or 4 hours on the battlefield after the end of the battle and departed at 9:00 p.m., this would imply that the battle (which lasted several hours) had finished between 5:00 p.m. and 6.00 p.m., –but all chroniclers of both sides agree that the battle began very late, at the sunset (7:00 p.m.) of that day. The battle could not have ended before it began. Moreover, Fedinand is contradicted even by the timing of the Castilian chronicler Bernáldez (whose battle's account is the closest to the King's letter), because this chronicler -who stated that Prince John remained on the battlefield after the Castilian withdrawal \\"with a great force of knights\\"-, estimated that the king (with his army) left the battlefield around midnight, while Ferdinand himself stated that he arrived in Zamora at 1:00 a.m. It is impossible that Ferdinand's army had made such a long journey from Peleagonzalo to Zamora in just an hour: 22 km in straight way, but much farther through the mountains, under the rain of a very dark night, after several hours of exhausting battle preceded by a chase of many hours, and carrying spoils. In addition to this, the timing given by Zurita in his Anales de la Corona de Aragon, strongly supports the conclusion that Ferdinand left the battlefield soon after the beginning of the battle: this chronicler states that Alfonso's army took three hours to complete half the distance between Zamora and Toro, and thus the Portuguese army took a little less than six hours to travel from Zamora to the battlefield, since it is located very near the city of Toro (just one league west of Toro, about 5 km, according to Ferdinand). Indeed, when Ferdinand's army reached the rearguard of the Portuguese army, in a point between Toro and Peleagonzalo, its vanguard (and most of its infantrymen) had already entered the city of Toro and were called back to face the enemy.Chaves in Duro, p. 255-256. But while the Portuguese were physically fresh and traveled in daylight through ground in good condition, Ferdinand returned to Zamora (making the same journey in reverse) walking and riding at night in complete darkness (worsened by intense rain and fog), the trail requesting a lot of attention due to the danger of falls on a wet and slippery ground caused by heavy rainfall; and finally men and horses were exhausted by the march and the pursuit of the enemy from Zamora to the battlefield near Toro, performing -literally- twice the distance traveled by the Portuguese. Thus, Ferdinand necessarily took more time for his Toro-Zamora march than the nearly six hours taken by the Portuguese to complete their journey Zamora-Toro. Since Ferdinand arrived in Zamora at 1:00 a.m. (according to himself) and since he took more than 6 hours in the journey, it is possible to calculate the hour Ferdinand left the battlefield of Peleagonzalo: around 7:00 pm, which matches the time given by the Portuguese chronicles (in the beginning of the battle –that started a few minutes before sunset, which on March 1 occurs around 7:10 p.m.-, when Ferdinand saw its right wing defeated and the fight between both royal battles still indecisive). Garcia de Resende: \\" … King Ferdinand, who, without fighting, was on a hill in the rear with a small battle, seeing the defeat inflicted by the Prince on his first two battles [the Castilian right wing was disposed in two lines: the first had five battles while the second had one battle], which had many more men than him [Prince John] , and seeing his big battle [centre and left wing] fully agitated (…), it appearing to him that it would be defeated as well, he abandoned everything and quickly sheltered in Zamora with those who were with him. \\" Damião de Góis: \\"King Ferdinand, as already told, placed himself in the rearguard of all his army with a small division, but as soon as he knew that Prince John had defeated the first six divisions, and [seeing] the fate of his royal battle undecided because neither his nor that of Alfonso was winning, sent word to the Cardinal of Spain and the Duke of Alba to take command of the army and do whatever they thought necessary; and before the Portuguese started to disband … he went to Zamora with that small division which was in the rearguard in front of the entrance of the way through the mountains, reaching the city by night, without him or those with him knowing if they were winners or losers. \\"Góis, chapter LXXVIII, p. 302-303. However, some historians have acritically accepted Ferdinand's letter as an impartial and reliable historical source, which is a tribute to Ferdinand's persuasive and convincing power. Finally, and on the other side of the coin, Prince's John letter to the main Portuguese cities (claiming victory) also omisses the defeat of his father's troops. The Battle of Toro and modern Spain An anachronous map of the Portuguese Empire (1415–1999) The great political genius of the Catholic Monarchs was to have been capable of transformingRenouard, p. 89: \\"The inconclusive Battle of Toro (1476), that the Isabella's propaganda transformed in victory... ruined the hopes of the King of Portugal\\".Erlanger: \\"who won [the battle of Toro]? Each one declares himself winner... a genius of propaganda... Isabella knew the effectiveness of propaganda... she organized feasts, proclaimed through Spain the news of her victory so that everybody believed it even if a less evident truth came out. (...) This false move, not the success of their arms at Toro gave their kingdom to Ferdinand and Isabella.\\" ( Electronic version).Bajo, p. 36: \\"...Battle of Toro... outcome... indecisive. The Castilians, still sore with the bitter defeat of Aljubarrota, attributed the victory to themselves.\\" one inconclusive battle\\"the result of this battle was very doubtful\\" in Hénault et al, p. 694.Schoell p. 351: \\"The war ended in 1476 with the battle of Toro (..) it was indecisive, but the subsequent events (...)\\" into a great moral, political, and strategic victory, which would not only assure them the crown but also create the foundations of the Spanish nation. The academic Rafael Dominguez Casas: \\"...San Juan de los Reyes resulted from the royal will to build a monastery to commemorate the victory in a battle with an uncertain outcome but decisive, the one fought in Toro in 1476, which consolidated the union of the two most important Peninsular Kingdoms.\\"Casas, p. 364. Soon came the Granada conquest, the discovery and colonization of the New World, the Spanish hegemony in Europe, and at last the \\"Siglo de Oro\\" (Spanish Golden Age) whose zenith was reached with the incorporation of Portugal and its fabulous empire into the Iberian Union, creating a web of territories \\"where the sun never sets\\". Nowadays, the relationship between Spain and Portugal is excellent and battles like the one of Toro seem part of a remote past: some Portuguese and Spanish commonly refer to each other by the designation of \\"nuestros hermanos\\", which means \\"our brothers\\" in Spanish.

The district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History Rosedale Gardens was platted by the Shelden Land Company in the 1920s. The company modeled the development on Rosedale Park in Detroit. The first house in Rosedale Gardens was the Harsha house, built in 1925; the house was occupied in January 1926. These houses were wood structures. A total of 61 houses were builtin in 1926, and by 1929, 121 homes had been constructed. I addition, a small grocery opened in 1926, a school on 1927, and Rosedale Gardens Presbyterian Church in 1928. When the Great Depression hit, construction stopped for a time; the developer bricked over existing homes, and continued with brick construction when building resumed later in the 1930s. About 250 homes were built in 1935-41, until World War II again intervened. Another housing boom occurred after the war, and by 1948 the original part of Rosedale Gardens contained 428 houses. Additional lots were platted, and homes built, through into the 1960s. Description The Rosedale Gardens Historic District is a residential neighborhood, encompassing approximately 1/4 square miles, containing about 570 houses, primarily from between 1925 and 1960. Houses are located along eight parallel streets running north–south. The streets are narrow and without curves, and lined with a collection of mature trees. Lots lining the streets are 40 feet wide and run 120 to 145 feet deep, and houses tend to be relatively modest in size, typically in the range of 1000 to 2000 square feet and one or two stories. The neighborhood is distinctive because, unlike nearly all of the surrounding neighborhoods, pre-World War II houses predominate, with 428 of the 570 total built before the war. Many of the oldest houses are wooden, although brick- faced houses predominate in the neighborhood. Architectural styles are typically Colonials and English cottages, with some newer ranch houses intermingled. File:RosedaleGardensHD2LivoniaMI.jpgEntrance to the neighborhood at Berwick and Plymouth.

The play is generally made by outfielders robbing hitters of hits that otherwise would have been home runs, or at the very least a double. A wall climb can also be made by outfielders or other position players by climbing the wall in foul territory to make an out. Under MLB rules, the catch is ruled an out when the fielder making the out has at least one foot over legal playing territory during the catch and no feet touching the ground of an out of play area, regardless of whether his body ultimately lands in the field of play or out of play.Rules on MLB.com One of the most notorious MLB players with a reputation for wall climbing is Minnesota Twins outfielder Torii Hunter.

In the Barak Valley region, the Bengali population constitute overwhelming majority of the population. The main incident took place on 19 May 1961 at Silchar railway station in which 15 Bengalis were killed by Assam police.  Events of 1960-61  =Background= In April, 1960, a proposal was raised at the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee, to declare Assamese as the one and only official language of the state. On 10 October 1960, Bimala Prasad Chaliha, the then Chief Minister of Assam presented a bill in the Legislative Assembly that sought to legalize Assamese as the sole official language of the state. Ranendra Mohan Das, the legislator from Karimganj (North) assembly constituency and an ethnic Bengali, protested against the bill on the ground that it sought to impose the language of a third of the population over the rest two thirds. On 24 October, the bill was passed in the Assam legislative assembly thereby making Assamese as the one and only official language of the state. =Protest= On 5 February 1961, the Cachar Gana Sangram Parishad was formed to agitate against the imposition of Assamese in the Bengali-speaking Barak Valley. On 14 April, the people of Silchar, Karimganj and Hailakandi observed a Sankalpa Divas in protest against the injustice of the Assamese government. On 24 April, the Parishad flagged off a fortnight long padayatra in the Barak Valley, in the regions surrounding Silchar and Karimganj to raise awareness among the masses. The satyagrahis who took part in the padayatra walked over 200 miles and covered several villages. The procession ended on 2 May in Silchar. Later on a similar padayatra was organized in Hailakandi. After the padayatra, Rathindranath Sen, the Parishad chief declared that if Bengali was not accorded the status of official language by 13 April 1961, a complete hartal would be observed on 19 May from dawn to dusk. The Parishad also called for due recognition of the languages of other linguistic minorities. On 12 May, the soldiers of the Assam Rifles, the Madras Regiment and the Central Reserve Police staged flag march in Silchar. On 18 May, the Assam police arrested three prominent leaders of the movement, namely Nalinikanta Das, Rathindranath Sen and Bidhubhushan Chowdhury, the editor of weekly Yugashakti. = Main incident of 19 May = Assam police resort to lathicharge on the satyagrahis at the Tarapur railway station (now, Silchar railway station). On 19 May, the dawn to dusk hartal started. Picketing started in the sub-divisional towns of Silchar, Karimganj and Hailakandi from early in the morning. In Karimganj, the agitators picketed in front of government offices, courts and railway station. In Silchar, the agitators picketed in the railway station. The last train from Silchar was around 4 PM, after which the hartal would be effectively dissolved. Not a single ticket was sold for the first train at 5-40 AM. The morning passed off peacefully without any untoward incident. However, in the afternoon, the Assam Rifles arrived at the railway station. At around 2-30 PM, a Bedford truck carrying nine arrested Satyagrahis from Katigorah was passing by the Tarapur railway station (present-day Silchar railway station). Seeing the fellow activists arrested and being taken away, the Satyagrahis assembled at the railway tracks broke out in loud protests. At that point the truck driver and the policemen escorting the arrested fled the spot. Immediately after they fled, an unidentified person set fire to the truck. A fire fighting team immediately rushed to the spot to bring the fire under control. Within five minutes, at around 2-35 PM, the paramilitary forces, guarding the railway station, started beating the protesters with rifle butts and batons without any provocation from them. Then within a span of seven minutes they fired 17 rounds into the crowd. Twelve persons received bullet wounds and were carried to hospitals. Nine of them died that day. Ullaskar Dutta send nine bouquets for nine martyrs. On 20 May, the people of Silchar took out a procession with the bodies of the martyrs in protest of the killings. Two more persons died later. One person, Krishna Kanta Biswas survived for another 24 hours with bullet wound in chest. Procession in Silchar on 20 May 1961 in memory of the deceased martyrs in defiance of the curfew. = Effect = After the incident, the Assam government had to withdraw the circular and Bengali was ultimately given official status in the three districts of Barak Valley. Section 5 of Assam Act XVIII, 1961, safeguards the use of Bengali in the Cachar district. It says, “Without prejudice to the provisions contained in Section 3, the Bengali language shall be used for administrative and other official purposes up to and including district level.”  Legacy  Language Martyr's Memorial at Silchar railway station. Silchar railway station is described as Bhasa Shahid Station This massacre is compared with the massacre in Jalianwalabag or the one in Bangladesh on 21 February 1952 when students demonstrating for recognition of their language, Bengali, as one of the two national languages of the then Pakistan, were shot and killed by police in Dhaka, which is the capital of present-day Bangladesh.International Mother Language Day Every year on 19 May is celebrated as Bhasha Shahid Divas (ভাষা শহীদ দিবস) to commemorate those 11 martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of protecting Bengali language, various cultural programmes are conducted, rallies are taken out and bust of those martyrs are decorated with flower garlands. The Assam government had on November 30, 2013 issued a circular asking the deputy commissioners of all districts of the state to ensure use of Assamese as official language, which generated a lot of protests in the three Barak Valley districts – Cachar, Karimganj and Hailakandi. Section 5 of the Assam Official Language Act 1960 as amended in 1967 had specified Bengali as the official language anyway. This prompted the state government to issue a fresh circular on September 9 saying that the official language (Bengali) of Barak Valley will continue to be used for all official works.

After the liberation of Bangladesh, Chowdhury escaped from Bangladesh and took British citizenship. Chowdhury is a founder of the Islamic Forum of Europe, believed to be an extremist organizationAndrew Gilligan, Backlash at the mosque, Daily Telegraph, 13 March 2010Andrew Gilligan, \\"IFE: not harmless democrats\\", The Guardian, 4 March 2010 and a trustee and former chairman of Muslim Aid, and a director of Muslim spiritual care provision in the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS). On 3 November 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal which is set up by the government of Bangladesh to judge international crimes committed during 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, sentenced Mueen-Uddin, in absentia, to death for killing 9 teachers of Dhaka University, 6 journalists and 3 doctors in 1971. Mueen has remained in the United Kingdom since leaving Bangladesh shortly after its independence in 1971. Mueen-Uddin denies the charges. He was alleged war criminal long before creation of International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh). In 1972, The New York Times reported that he \\"has been identified as the head of a secret, commando-like organization of fanatic Moslems\\", In 1995, a documentary film made by David Bergman, named War Crimes File was aired on British television channel Channel 4 showing his involvement in 1971 Bangladesh genocide. Career In 1971, Mueen-Uddin was a journalist at the Daily Purbodesh. In 1972, The New York Times reported that he \\"has been identified as the head of a secret, commando-like organization of fanatic Moslems\\", in connection with the Bangladesh liberation war. He fled Bangladesh shortly after its independence in 1971, and went to the United Kingdom via India, Nepal and Pakistan In the United Kingdom he was able to create a new life. He was a special editor of the London-based weekly Dawat and a leader of the London-based Jamaat organisation Dawatul Islam. Mueen-Uddin is a director of Muslim Spiritual Care Provision in the United Kingdom's National Health Service (NHS), a member of Multi Faith Group for Healthcare Chaplaincy (MFGHC), and a trustee of Muslim Aid. He is currently a citizen of the UK. Since moving to the UK in the early 1970s, Mueen-Uddin has taken British citizenship and built a career as a community activist and Muslim leader. In 1989 he was a key leader of protests against Salman Rushdie's novel, The Satanic Verses. Around the same time he helped to found the extremist Islamic Forum of Europe, Jamaat-e-Islami's European wing, which believes in creating a sharia state in Europe and in 2010 was accused by a Labour minister, Jim Fitzpatrick, of infiltrating the Labour Party. Tower Hamlets' directly-elected mayor, Lutfur Rahman, was expelled from Labour for his close links with the IFE. Until 2010 Mr Mueen-Uddin was vice-chairman of the controversial East London Mosque, controlled by the IFE, in which capacity he greeted Prince Charles when the heir to the throne opened an extension to the mosque. He was also closely involved with the Muslim Council of Britain, which has been dominated by the IFE. He was chairman and remains a trustee of the IFE-linked charity, Muslim Aid, which has a budget of £20 million. He has also been closely involved in the Markfield Institute, the key institution of Islamist higher education in the UK. War crimes trial In 1995, a documentary film War Crimes File by David Bergman was aired on British television channel Channel 4 about the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. In the film, Mueen-Uddin was accused of being a member of the pro-Pakistan paramilitary force Al-Badr during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, and of being involved in war crimes. In 2012, Bangladesh law minister Shafique Ahmed stated that Mueen- Uddin would be charged for war crimes. However, the prosecution has delayed submitting charges. He is accused of being a top member of the notorious paramilitary force Al-Badr and of the fundamentalist Jamaat-e-Islami political party, which fought for the country to remain part of Pakistan. Mueen-Uddin has denied all allegations. =Arrest warrant and extradition conditions= On 2 May 2013, Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal brought war criminal charges against Mueen-Uddin and Ashrafuz Zaman Khan. The United Kingdom does not have an extradition agreement with Bangladesh, and the UK was reluctant to extradite Mueen-Uddin without assurances of a fair trial, plus assurances that there would be no death penalty in the event of a guilty verdict. Although Scotland Yard said in the 1990s that Bangladesh had primary jurisdiction for prosecuting Mueen for the 1971 killings, Britain could reconsider its decision to not prosecute. Both Mueen and Khan were charged with committing a war crime by killing 18 intellectuals who were Dhaka University Professors Ghyasuddin Ahmed, Rashidul Hasan, Anwar Pasha, Faizul Mahi, famous playwright and Professor Munier Chowdhury, Mufazzal Haider Chaudhury, Dr Abul Khair, Dr Santosh Chandra Bhattacharyya and Dr Sirajul Haque Khan, Professor of Cardiology Mohammed Fazle Rabbee, eminent eye specialist AFM Alim Chowdhury, Physician Mohammad Martuza, Novelist and Journalist Shahidullah Kaiser, Journalist and Poet Selina Parvin, Journalists Serajuddin Hossain, Syed Nazmul Haque, ANM Golam Mostafa, and Nizamuddin Ahmed, in between 10 and 15 December 1971. An arrest warrant also issued for them. Both of them was most wanted after Bangladesh liberation war. According to prob report Chowdhury Mueen- Uddin was \\"operation-in-charge of Al-Badr\\". =Allegations from the relatives of the victims= The widow of one victim, Dolly Chaudhury, claims to have identified Mr Mueen-Uddin as one of three men who abducted her husband, Mufazzal Haider Chaudhury, a prominent scholar of Bengali literature, on the night of 14 December 1971. \\"I was able to identify one [of the abductors], Mueen-Uddin,\\" she said in video testimony, seen by The Sunday Telegraph. \\"He was wearing a scarf but my husband pulled it down as he was taken away. When he was a student, he often used to go to my brother in law's house. My husband, my sister-in-law, my brother-in-law, we all recognised that man.\\" Professor Chaudhury was never seen again. The widow of another victim, claims that Mr Mueen-Uddin was in the group that abducted her husband, Sirajuddin Hussain, another journalist, from their home on the night of 10 December 1971. \\"There was no doubt that he was the person involved in my husband's abduction and killing,\\" said Noorjahan Seraji. \\"I have waited 40 years to see the trial of the war criminals,\\" said the widow, Noorjahan Seraji. \\"I have not spent a single night without suffering and I want justice.\\" One of the other members of the group, who was caught soon afterwards, allegedly gave Mr Mueen-Uddin's name in his confession. Another reporter on Purbodesh, Ghulam Mostafa, also disappeared. The vanished journalist's brother, Dulu, said he appealed to Mr Mueen-Uddin for help and was taken around the main Pakistani Army detention and torture centres by Mr Mueen-Uddin. Dulu Mostafa said that Mr Mueen-Uddin appeared to be well known at the detention centres, gained easy admission to the premises and was saluted by the Pakistani guards as he entered. Ghulam was never found. Mueen-Uddin's then editor at the paper, Atiqur Rahman, said that Mr Mueen-Uddin had been the first journalist in the country to reveal the existence of the Al-Badr Brigade and had demonstrated intimate knowledge of its activities. After his colleagues disappeared, he said, Mueen-Uddin had asked for his home address. Fearing that he too would be abducted, the editor gave a fake address. Rahman's name, complete with the fake address, appeared on an Al-Badr death list found just after the end of the war. \\"I gave that address only to Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin, and when that list appeared it was obvious that he had given that address to Al Badr,\\" Rahman said in statements given to the investigators. \\"I'm sure I gave the address to no-one else.\\" Rahman then published a front-page story and picture about Mueen-Uddin, who had by that stage left the city, naming him as involved in \\"disappearances.\\" This brought forward two further witnesses, Mushtaqur and Mahmudur Rahman, who claim they recognised the picture as somebody who had been part of an armed group looking for the BBC correspondent in Dhaka during the abductions. The group was unsuccessful because the BBC man had gone into hiding. =Verdict= On 3 November 2013, the International Crimes Tribunal – a special Bangladeshi court set up by the government – sentenced Mueen-uddin to death after the tribunal found him guilty in absentia of torture and murder of 18 intellectuals during 1971 Liberation war of Bangladesh. According to The Daily Star, lawyers called no defence witnesses, whereas the prosecution brought in 25 witnesses, due to non-co-operation from Mueen-Uddin's family. Those sentenced in absentia are not eligible to challenge the court's verdict. Chowdhury Mueen-Uddin denied the charges in an interview aired by Al Jazeera in August 2013. The tribunal also said that Mueen-Uddin sometimes carried out the murders, and sometimes instigated and encouraged them. They ruled that he and his allies had complete control over the Al Badr during the 1971 War. =Reaction of trial from defence= However, the trial was criticised by Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, the party he was served and which opposed the creation of Bangladesh and took part in committing war crime in 1971, stated that the trials were politically motivated. They also accused the current government of trying to destroy the opposition party by sentencing its leadership to death. However, the political motivation against Mueen-Uddin is unclear as he is living in the UK for more than 40 years. Mueen-Uddin's Legal Counsel described the verdict as \\"farcical\\". He further alleged \\"serious judicial and prosecutorial misconduct and the collusion of the Government with members of the judiciary and prosecution\\", and condemned the entire trial as a \\"show trial\\". John Cammegh, a barrister in chambers at 9 Bedford Row, London, which represents Mueen-Uddin, in an op-ed piece, stated that the trial \\"made mockery of that principle [of international law], and that it served as \\"a terrible warning of the way in which the ideals of universal justice and accountability can be abused\\". =Reaction from victims' relatives about verdict= Relatives of the victims voiced their satisfaction at the verdicts. Professor Rashiddudin Ahmad, whose brother Giasuddin Ahmed, a university teacher at the time was amongst those killed, said: \\"We have waited 40 years for this. It is some sort of justice, even though the sentence may never be carried out.\\" =Europe's reaction to the trial= The UK said on 22 January 2013 that it supported the war crimes trial in Bangladesh but always opposed capital punishment while Germany and France termed the trial an internal affair of the country. They gave their reactions a day after the International Crimes Tribunal-2 awarded death sentence to Abul Kalam Azad for genocide and crimes against humanity during the Liberation War. Warren Daley, spokesperson of the British high commission in Dhaka, said: “The UK has made clear its support for Bangladesh’s efforts to bring to justice those accused of atrocities committed in 1971. Along with our EU partners, we are however opposed to the application of the death penalty in all circumstances.\\" See also * Al-Badr, paramilitary wing of the West Pakistan Army during the Bangladesh Liberation War * Razakars, paramilitary force in East Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War References External links * About MFGHC.

Regular services, however, were not held until 1896, the year the parish was founded. The congregation held services in a rented room on the east side of the courthouse square until this church was opened in 1900. with The Shingle style building was designed by the Des Moines architectural firm of Proudfoot & Bird. In 1950 the basement of the church was excavated. The church building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Architecture St. Paul's Church follows a cross-shaped plan that measures . It is eclectic in style in that it combines the Shingle Style and Gothic Revival decorative elements that are expressed through different types of materials. The lowest level of the exterior is brick, above which are narrow clapboards up to the imposts of the lancet windows, and shingling above that to the eaves. Shingling is also found on the main facade. The structure is capped by a busy roofscape. The main roof is a high-pitched gable that features small triangular dormers. The transepts have hip roofs, and they too have small dormers. The narthex's gable roof sits at a right angle to the main roof. There is another hipped roof over the central bay of the narthex that houses the baptistery. Rising above the main roof is a short, square, central tower. Although clad in shingles, it suggests the Richardsonian Romanesque style and appears out of scale to the rest of the building. The tower features pinnacles on its corners and it culminates in a high-peaked roof with a finial on top. There are also finials on several other roof and dormer peaks. Lancet windows are located in the nave and transepts. There are trefoil windows in the dormers. A large, recessed rose window is located on the front facade of the nave, and a triptych window located on the opposite end of the church over the altar. Entrances into the church are located in three of the four corners. They, like the windows, employ the pointed arch, and are recessed below bargeboards. The interior features an oak hammerbeam ceiling, plaster walls, and wainscoting. The pointed arch predominates throughout.

While at Holy Cross he was awarded a Thomas J. Watson Fellowship to study water purification in Indonesia for a year. Leaving Indonesia, Martin next attended Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, Italy, on a Rotary International scholarship, earning another bachelor's degree. While in Rome, he decided to attend law school and was accepted to Saint Louis University School of Law. While at law school, Martin attended a Thanksgiving dinner with Pope John Paul II in 1997. Martin received an invitation to the dinner because he served as the sole youth representative expert of the Synod of the Bishops on the Americas. Following graduation, Martin worked first as director of the Human Rights Office for the Archdiocese of St. Louis. Legal career As an attorney in private practice, Martin specialized in differing commercial and Pro bono cases. Martin did legal work for the Institute for Justice, Human Action Network, Bryan Cave, LLP, Americans United for Life, Martin Simmonds, LLC, and formed his own law practice, Ed Martin Law Firm, LLC. In addition, Martin served as law clerk for the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit under the Honorable Pasco M. Bowman II. In 2005 while working for Americans United for Life, Martin represented two Illinois pharmacists who sought relief from an administrative rule requiring Illinois pharmacists doing public business to dispense a certain contraceptive, levonorgestrol, also known as \\"Plan B\\" or the \\"morning after pill\\", under the state's health plan. They argued that such distribution violated their religious rights of conscience. Martin appeared on Lou Dobbs to discuss the case with Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. The court sided with Martin and the plaintiffs, agreeing that the Administrative Rule violated the Rights of Conscience Act; it granted the plaintiffs a permanent injunction. In 2006 while doing pro bono work for the Institute for Justice and the Human Action Network, Martin represented a small business owner who sold caskets and funeral supplies at discounted prices. In an effort to regulate abuses in the funeral business, the State of Missouri required vendors of caskets to have a funeral director's license. Martin and other attorneys argued that the government should not prevent the businessman from selling caskets at a discount and helping people avoid inflated costs of purchasing a casket from funeral homes. Eventually, the State Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors sided with the small business owner. Political career In 2005 Governor Matt Blunt appointed Ed Martin as chairman of the St. Louis Board of Election Commissioners. He also headed the leadership team that designed and implemented the Missouri Accountability Portal, an Internet search engine developed by the Blunt administration to track state government spending in order to increase transparency.http://mapyourtaxes.mo.gov/MAP/Portal/Default.aspx In August 2006 Governor Matt Blunt appointed Martin as his Chief of Staff.https://www.lakeexpo.com/news/top_stories/blunt-s-chief-of-staff- politicized-his-office/article_6f152766-40ab-550f-9488-e1939b01895a.html While serving as Blunt's chief of staff, Martin was linked to the controversial firing of Scott Eckersley, then Deputy General Counsel for Blunt. In the summer of 2007, Martin's office had resisted providing his emails to an investigative reporter from the Springfield (MO) News-Leader, who was investigating whether Martin used his office to influence outside groups against political opponents. Martin claimed there were no emails that pertained to the issue. A Blunt spokesman said the administration did not have a policy of retaining emails, although the state Sunshine Law requiring retention for 3 years is widely known. The administration claimed it had fired Eckersley because he had violated internal policies. He filed a lawsuit against Martin and Blunt for his firing, saying he had been trying to enforce the state law for retention of emails. Several major media outlets filed suit to gain access to Martin's and other emails of the administration. Martin resigned as Chief of Staff in November 2007, followed by Blunt's General Counsel, Henry Herschel. After a year-long battle to gain access, in November 2008, the Kansas City Star and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch analyzed and reported on 60,000 pages of emails obtained from the administration. They found that Martin had used his state office in 2007 improperly to encourage opposition to Attorney General Jay Nixon among anti-abortion groups, as the Democrat Nixon was likely to oppose Blunt in the next election.\\"The e-mails that brought down a Republican Governor\\", 17 November 2008, accessed 12 September 2014 He had also pressured political appointees of state agencies to criticize Nixon's handling of some issues as AG.

On May 22, 2009, the Missouri Attorney General's office announced that Eckersley's lawsuit against Blunt and others had been settled for $500,000.

Martin was elected in the second round of balloting by the Republican State Committee, defeating Cole 34 votes to 32. Former Missouri State Senator Jane Cunningham was also a candidate for the party leadership. Noting that state Republican Party officials were often more conservative than most of their members, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorialized that Martin was an unfortunate choice for the GOP. They commented on his having cost the state \\"taxpayers about $2 million for an investigation spurred by his destruction of public records when he was chief of staff to Gov. Matt Blunt.\\" As party chairman, Martin criticized advertising in the Republican primary campaign for the United States Senate election in Mississippi, 2014, which was marked by race-based ads appearing to encourage Democrats to vote in support of candidate Thad Cochran, as well as robo-calls to African-American voters thought to be made by his opponent Chris McDaniel's campaign, which were derogatory to President Barack Obama. It was reported that Cochran and allies were \\"looking to increase voter turnout across the state, particularly among African Americans and Democrats who had not voted in the June 3 primary.\\" Martin criticized any race-based advertising by Republican candidates. \\"I don’t know how that can be allowed in the Republican party,\\" Martin says. \\"If it is, we have no credibility, we have no moral standing.\\" McDaniel lost the primary by 7,000 votes but refused to concede, marring party efforts to prepare for the general election. In addition, Martin made a motion to censure Barbour at the annual RNC August summer meeting in Chicago. This effort fizzled, but the issue was discussed in member meetings. Henry Barbour is the nephew of former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour.  Electoral history  Personal life Ed Martin is married to Carol Martin, a physician and instructor at the St. Louis University School of Medicine. Ed's younger brother James T. Martin is a career Marine officer, promoted to Lt. Colonel in 2013.\\"OFFICER PROMOTIONS FOR JUNE 2013 AND PROJECTED OFFICER PROMOTIONS FOR JULY 2013\\" , United States Marine Corps, official website, accessed 15 September 2014 He wrote The Development of Marine Corps Junior Officers during the Interwar Period and its Relevance Today.

The Unocal 76 Challenge was an award program for the NASCAR Winston Cup Series from 1989-1999 sponsored by the Unocal Corporation. Unocal posted a $7,600 cash prize if the pole position winner for each NASCAR Winston Cup event went on to win the race. If the prize was not claimed, it was rolled over to the next race until the pot was claimed. The award program proved to be popular among competitors and fans, and was considered NASCAR's version of a Skins Game. The award provided over $2 million in cash prizes to NASCAR drivers. Award details In December 1988, Unocal, the official provider of gasoline fuel for NASCAR at the time, created a cash prize incentive for drivers who win a race from the pole position. It would begin with the 1989 NASCAR season. The $7,600 amount was a gesture to Unocal's famous 76 logo. At the time, drivers had few incentives to win pole positions. As such, it was not unusual for smaller teams to put in extra effort for qualifying in order to win poles and gain exposure (but performing as an also-ran in the race itself), while top teams sometimes would forgo some effort in qualifying and concentrate on race set-ups. The Busch Pole Award was only $500, championship points are not awarded for pole positions, and the pole winner was not given the honor of the first pit stall selection until the mid-1990s. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, many NASCAR races, particularly at smaller tracks, still had relatively small purses. The Unocal 76 Challenge gave drivers the potential of significantly increasing their possible winning payouts. The award was eligible only to the driver who officially won the pole position during Busch Pole Qualifying for each points-paying NASCAR Winston Cup Series race. If the pole position winner went on to win the race, he was awarded a cash prize of $7,600. If the award was not achieved, the $7,600 was rolled over to the next race. The award would continue to roll over until it was claimed. If the award was not won during the final race of the season, it rolled over to the first race of the next season, and continued. If qualifying was rained out, and the starting field set by points, the award was not available for that race, and would roll over to the next event automatically. The Unocal 76 Challenge bonus money was awarded alongside a separate Unocal 76 Contingency Award, which was handed out at the end of the season. Award history Initially, the award did not receive much attention. The first driver eligible for the award was Ken Schrader, who won the pole position for the 1989 Daytona 500. Schrader finished second in the race, so the award rolled over to the next race. At the second race of the season, the Goodwrench 500 at North Carolina Motor Speedway, Rusty Wallace won from the pole position. He became the first driver to claim the Unocal Challenge, and collected an initial award of $15,200 which included one rollover. (At the season-ending banquet, Wallace was presented with a total check for $22,800) As the 1989 season wore on, the award was not being won, and the cash prize rolled over every subsequent week. Mid-way through the season, it was nearing $100,000. In the final race of the season at Atlanta, the award had grown to $205,200, considerably more than the $50,000 first prize. Polesitter Alan Kulwicki failed to win the race, and the award rolled over to the 1990 season. At the 1990 season opener, the Daytona 500, Ken Schrader won the pole position. The Unocal Challenge award was up to $212,800. Controversy erupted when Schrader wrecked his car during the Gatorade 125s. NASCAR deemed that Schrader, who would start the race from the rear of the field in a back-up car, was still eligible for the huge award. The controversy fizzled when Schrader dropped out early. (The car that actually started from the pole spot, Geoff Bodine, did not win either). The bonus rolled over yet again. One week later, at Goodwrench 500 at North Carolina Motor Speedway, the Unocal Challenge bonus stood at $228,000. Kyle Petty finally broke the streak, leading 433 laps (of 492) and won the race from the pole position. His bonus money (officially $228,000), along with the posted race purse, gave him total earnings of $284,450 a single-race NASCAR record at the time. =Winners= Rusty Wallace became the first driver to win the Unocal Challenge bonus. Kyle Petty won a record $228,400 Unocal Challenge bonus in 1990.

In a related move, longtime NASCAR fixture Bill Brodrick, the head of public relations for Unocal's racing division and known as \\"The Hat Man\\" in victory lane, was released from his position. At the end of the 1999 season, the Unocal 76 Challenge bonus was retired, with $136,800 in bonus money going unclaimed over the final 17 races of the season. After the 2003 season, Unocal left the sport of NASCAR. During its eleven-year history, the Unocal 76 Challenge bonus was claimed 48 times by 15 different drivers. The total bonus money awarded was $2,447,600. Jeff Gordon won the Unocal 76 Challenge bonus the most times (11) for a total of $349,600 in prize money. The driver winning the most bonus money, however, was Kyle Petty who pocketed $395,600 for his three rather large Unocal 76 Challenge bonuses. Two times during the award's tenure, Dale Earnhardt won races from the pole position (1990 TranSouth 500 & 1993 TranSouth 500) but qualifying was rained out in both cases. Those field were set by championship owners points standings, and the award was automatically rolled over to the next race without being given out in both situations.

The village is mainly inhabited by Macushi people. The village had a population of 332 inhabitants according to the 2012 census. The village got its meaning as \\"get soft\\" that dates back to historic time. The people depend on subsistence farming and use of natural resources to sustain their livelihood. The men predominately go hunting, fishing, and gather non-timber forest products for their families on a seasonal basis. Geography Wowetta is surrounded by the Pakaraima Mountains and Makarapan Mountain to the east, range of the Kanuku Mountains that divides the Rupununi savannah in half, creating the North Rupununi Savannah that is predominantly occupied by the Macushi people, and the South Rupununi Savannah that is occupied by the Wapishana people and the Wai-wai people. The village is surrounded by pristine tropical rainforest and is one of the villages that border the Iwokrama International Rainforest Protected area. The people of the North Rupununi have all rights to continue their traditional rights, such as hunting as well as gathering non-timber forest Products in the Protected area. There is a signed Community Management Agreement (CMA) between Iwokrama and a standing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to be signed with the North Rupununi District Development Board (NRDDB). Additionally, the village benefits from a 15% paid to the NRDDB as forest users’ fee that is used for the further development of the various villages that surround that area. As such Wowetta is a member of the North Rupununi District Development Board that is bisected by the Georgetown to Lethem highway. Population The people speak predominantly Macushi language as their first language, and English as their second language. Their main staple foods are cassava bread, farine and pepper pot. The men are skilled craftsmen who produce crafts that the women use to process the various by-product of the cassava. The men also practice traditional hunting, using bows and arrows, and traditional traps. The fish using line and hook, traps, and poisoning of small waterways. The homes are made of adobe wall and thatched roofs from the kokarite palm. Women engage in cotton weaving, making slings and hammocks. The people rely heavily on their agricultural products as well as their handicrafts to earn their income. The average household income that a household earns per month is about $5,000 (25 USD) per month.Xavier,B.: \\"Community Participation in the Management of the Cock-of-the-Rock as an eco-torusim initiative\\", p. 14. University of Guyana (2007) The village has a number of projects that contribute to income generation, some of which are ecotourism, farine production, a village shop, vegetable garden, and a youth joinery project. These earn a small percentage of income generated from revenues paid for the use of resources, such as non- timber forest products and timber. These projects employ about 10% of the residents and the remainder go out into the gold mines, and often seasonally migrate to Brazil. Additionally, some of the villagers practice small scale forestry to support their families. Politics Wowetta is located in the Upper Takutu-Upper Essequibo Region # 9, approximately 450 km South of the capital city, Georgetown. It is a satellite village to Annai, and is governed by a Village Council along with four other villages, Surama, Kwatamang, Rupertee, and Annai. These five villages hold one land title with a population of 1,500 people (2006 census) with a total land area of 188,000 km², and falls under the administration of the Ministry of Amerindian Affairs, Georgetown, and the Regional Democratic Council. The Village Council of Wowetta ensures that the people are adequately represented based on issues affecting individuals. The village Council is mandated to manage natural resources on communal land and to develop rules and regulations that control the use by outsiders. The village council holds its statutory meetings on a quarterly basis. At these meetings persons are given the opportunity to raise issues, as well as an update of the village operation. The issues of individual are noted and taken on board at various levels. The village council consists of seven Councillors, headed by a Toshao (Chief), and has a three term in office before they are replaced or re-elected. Additionally, the development of the Linden- Lethem road link will contribute to positive and negative development for the people, hence there is need to resolve the problem in order to prepare the people for the imminent changes that will emerge with the various developments. History Wowetta is located about 7 miles to the northeast of Annai. The local Macushi name is aweta nî pî which means \\"get soft\\", but the non-Macushi corrupted the name to Wowetta. The first people to settle here were the Payako. Almost all were all wiped out by a terrible sickness – fever, vomiting and diarrhoea – which led to the severe dehydration and death in the early 1960s. The survivors moved away to the riverain locations like Makapa, Crash Water and Rewa. From that time the place was named Aweta, since the sickness made the people's flesh ‘get soft’, putrid. After that, other Payako came from the south Pakaraima to settle in this place. They traded parrots, beads and earthen pots with the Arekuna who came from far off Roraima, receiving in exchange files, cutlasses and cloth. The Caribs came to hear of this trade and waged war on the Macushi Payako. Out of envy, the Caribs killed all the men and took away the women. The few survivors had to flee, leaving the Caribs in possession of these lands. The Payako sought help from the Arekuna of Roraima, returning to battle the Caribs. The Caribs had firearms but the Arekuna and Macushi used their clubs, taike. There was one pitched battle at Karanambo, others elsewhere. The other enemies of the Macushi were the Brazilians who also captured Macushi women and took them away. As a result of their alliances to fight the Caribs, the resulting people of the Annai area are a mixture of Arekuna and Payako Macushi. Their tactics involved setting the Caribs camps alight during the night. Over time they succeeded in chasing the Caribs north of the coast where they can be found to this day. Economy Wowetta has a number of economic activities that assist the village generate income, such as eco-tourism, agricultural processing and activities. =Tourism= Eco-tourism helps to promote the conservation of natural resources as well as help to gather information on the existence of other natural resources that can be managed by the community. Wowetta has a unique by-product that is a tourist attraction, the Guianan Cock-of-the-Rock (Rupicola rupicola). When visitors visit the site they observe the mating rituals of the male and female birds. The birds display a unique dance, where the dominant males dances in circles while the female perches about 1 meter above the ground. When the female sees a male that displays the best dance, she then falls to the ground and makes her selection and leaves the site and heads for mating. A dominant male is always protecting a cleared site where they would usually display to the females. The Cock-of-the-rock lays two eggs and when the eggs hatch, only one hatchling will survive. This is because of the competition for food, when the chicks begin to develop. =Agro- processing= Cassava has been cultivated by the Macushis and Wapishiana for centuries. They produce their staple food by processing the cassava into end products of Cassava bread, farine, casreep and tapioca. This is their main meal, with fish or meat. The women's group of Wowetta has started to process cassava into large quantities that is supplied to the Ministry of Amerindian Affairs as part of its relief program to help the problem of flood affected villages. The processing takes the effort of a number of women who are engaged in processing, such as the initial harvesting to the final stage. This project is supported by a mill that makes it somewhat less labor-intensive. The processing requires harvesting the cassava, and soaking the cassava for four days, while the women return to their farm to harvest fresh bitter cassava. When it is transported to the processing site, the women scrape the skin outside of the cassava. The peeled cassava is then washed and placed into the cassava mill.

Hill led the campaign to pass instant runoff voting in San Francisco in 2002, which was the first victory for electoral system reform in the United States since the 1950s, and was a leader in other campaigns for instant runoff voting and public financing of campaigns. He is a cofounder of FairVote and former director of the political reform program at the New America Foundation. Life Hill was born in New London, Connecticut and lived there until the age of four when his family relocated up the Thames River to Uncasville, a borough of Montville. He lived there until he went to college, attending Yale University, the University of Connecticut, and Western Washington University/Fairhaven College. In the early 1990s, he cofounded Citizens for Proportional Representation (CPR) along with Rob Richie and Matthew Cossolotto. CPR soon changed its name to the Center for Voting and Democracy, and Hill and Richie became its first two employees in the mid-1990s. The Center underwent another name change in the early 2000s, and now is known as FairVote. Work Hill has been widely known in the United States for advancing the political reforms of proportional representation, instant runoff voting, public financing of campaigns, universal voter registration, national direct election of the president and reform of the U.S. Senate. He made the argument for these reforms and others in his books 10 Steps to Repair American Democracy (2006), Fixing Elections: The Failure of America's Winner Take All Politics (2003) and Reflecting All of Us/Whose Vote Counts (2001, co-authored with Rob Richie). He also advanced these political reforms by penning numerous op-eds and articles in leading American publications such as The New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Daily News, Financial Times, The Guardian, International Herald Tribune and many others.http://www.newamerica.net/people/archives/23?type=article At the same time, Hill also wore a second hat of political reformer and campaigner.

The mosque is made of wood and structured without nails by woodworkers and calligraphers. The woodworks are arranged in geometric balance and painted with natural colors. A philanthropist in the village of Burirchar, Momin Uddin Akon, started building this mosque in 1913 by employing twenty-one artisans, and it took seven years to complete the work. In 2003, the Department of Archaeology (Bangladesh) recognized it as a national heritage and listed it under the name Momin Mosque for its care and protection. In 2008, the archaeological department started some restoration work on Momin Mosque; however, the restoration work somewhat changed its original appearance.  History  As a young man, Momin Uddin Akon dreamt of building a mosque, as he had to walk a long distance to perform his daily prayers. Momin Uddin visited many mosques in the nation and gathered lots of information about their architecture, including their design and calligraphy. In Bangladesh, most of the mosques are made of bricks or stones, specially those are built in the Mughal period. Influenced by this traditional, Momin Uddin Akon started building a mosque using bricks, manufacturing the bricks in his backyard. Soon afterwards he abandoned the idea of building it with bricks, and decided to build the mosque with wood, as most of the houses (if not all) in the village are made of wood, and the village is full of scenic views with plants, woods, fruits etc. As a matter of fact, most of the designs in the mosque are made of images of leaves, flowers and fruits such as pineapples. These images are carved on fine woods and painted with natural colors. Young Momin Uddin Akon enhanced his knowledge by learning Arabic language, Islamic cultures, Islamic calligraphy, and architectural designs which he tried to blend into his village scenery as well as architectures. Momin Uddin himself lived in a simple village house and practiced a simple life. He employed twenty two artisans mainly from the Swarupkati area in Barisal district, and collected fine woods from Chittagong and Myanmar. All of the plans, layouts, designs, colors and calligraphy were solely directed by Momin Uddin Akon. One of two inscriptions with calligraphic designs is placed over the main entrance, and the other one is fixed over the mihrab. Information about the construction period is carved into the frontal inscription in Bengali and is situated at the right hand side of the entrance. In the last two decades the mosque has suffered from extensive rain, causing water to deteriorate the color and integrity of the woodwork. To save the mosque, Mohammad Shahidullah, a grandson of the founder Momin Uddin Akon, started writing numerous articles in national daily news and archaeological journals, and then published a book (Momin Mosque - Smriti Bismritir Katha), which raised awareness about the preservation and protection of the Momin Mosque. As a result, in 2003, this mosque was recognized as a national heritage and was listed as Momin Mosque under the \\"Antiquities Act 1976\\" by the Directorate of Archaeology.  Founder's history  Momin Uddin Akon was born in 1883 in Udaytara Burirchar (the village is also known as Burirchar) in Pirojpur district. At the age of six, his father, Ibrahim Akon. His mother, Ayshon-Bibi, successfully raised Momin Uddin Akon with proper education and guidance. His father Ibrahim Akon was known as an educated person who spoke Arabic as well as Persian and Bengali. As a result, he was known as Akon Shahib in the community. Ibrahim Akon founded a well-designed home for his family in 1830. This home is known as Akon Bari and the Momin Mosque was built in the front yard. Based on interviews, it is known that Momin Uddin Akon's grand father, Mr. Idris Howlader, came from the northern part of Barisal district, also known as Jhalokati. He was a close associate of Balaki Shah, a leader of oppressed peasants, who formed a rebellious party and built a fort in the village of Sungandhiya in Jhalokathi district in 1792. This party is known as the Barisal Peasant Movement. Balaki Shah collected seven cannons, twelve ginjals, several muskets, and used two men to make gunpowder. He proclaimed to his followers that the reign of the Feringhies, also known as the Europeans, was over, and he declared independence. Later on, he was apparently apprehended by a Naib with a force of eighty-eight British policemen. After this defeat, his follower Idris Howlader (grandfather of Momin Uddin Akon) migrated in the southern part of the district, Udaytara Burirchar, which was a part of Sundarbans at that time. Akon Bari front yard. Momin Mosque(left) government elementary school(right)  Historical sketch of the land  The Greater Barisal division, previously known as the Bakarganj district, lies in the lower portion of the Ganges delta which was formed by deposits from the united waters of Ganges or Padma, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna. Barisal is an alluvial deposit, but the date of its formation is not known. It appears probable, however, that it consisted of a chain of islands separated by wide rivers in the thirteenth century. These islands gradually consolidated into the modern district, and the process is still going on. Four great rivers flow through greater Barisal area in a southerly direction: Baleswar, Bishkhali, Burishwar, and Agunmukha. Upstream of the Baleswar is the origin of the Ganges river. It started with the name of Madhumoti, and then was renamed as Katcha, and then downstream of Pirojpur it becomes the Baleswar, and finally enters the bay of Bengal under the name of Haringhatta. The village of Udaytara Burirchar is located on the bank of this great river, Baleswar. The Finance Minister to the Emperor Akbar, Todar Mal's settlement took place in 1582, when the greater part of the Barisal area appears to have been included for the first time in the ancient Zamindari or Pargana of Chandradwip, which belonged to the Sarker Bakla, also called Ismailpur. In 1658, another settlement of Bengal was made by Sultan Suja, one of the sons of Emperor Shahjehan. In this settlement, the Sundarbans were included under the name of Muradkhana or Jeradkhana. In 1722, a third settlement was made by Nawab Jaffer Khan in the reign of Muhammad Shah. A fourth settlement was made by Mir Kashim in 1763. The next settlement was the Decennial or Parmanent Settlement during the collectorship of Mr. William Douglas, who was then collector of Dhaka. The village Burirchar was a part of Thuskhali estate which is situated in the thana (Upazila) of Mathbaria under the present district of Pirojpur. It was a Sundarbans estate entirely reclaimed from forest. Tushkhali estate comprised 23 villages covering an area of about , and Udaytara Burirchar is the adjacent village housing the headquarters of Tushkhali. The estate was originally a jungle tract belonging to the Sundarbans; the Zamindar of the adjoining Pargana Saidpur encroached upon the lands and granted leases for its reclamation. This fact was discovered in March 1830 by Mr. Williama Dampier, then commissioner of the Sundarbans, and he confiscated the estate. Later on in 1840, the commissioner of the Sundarbans, Mr. F.B. Kemp, farmed out the estate to Devanath Roy, Zaminder of Taki for twenty years. At one time the oppressive Morrell got hold of the estate by way of changing hands. As a consequence the peasants of Tushkhali became rebellious and stopped paying rent. Later on, the government canceled the tenure of the Morrell and the Tushkhali estate came under the direct control of the central government. There were four markets in the estate situated in Mathbaria, Tushakhali, Bara- masua and Dhanisafa. The principal articles of export were rice, coconuts and betel nuts, and the chief imports were salt, tobacco, sugar, oil, corrugated iron, and timber. Village in a clearing Sundarbans, by Frederic Peter Layard, January 1839. Frederic sketched it on 19 January 1839 using pen and ink. The image is inscribed: 'No.3., Hindu village in the Sundarbans, FP Layard, Ferozepore'. The Sunderbans are a large area of fresh and saltwater mangrove swamps in Bangladesh and neighbouring Bengal which cover sixty to eighty miles and consist of flat marshy islands covered with dense forests, inhabited by crocodiles and forming the final retreat of the Bengal Tiger.  Architectural influence  Mosque architecture is a continuation of pre-Islamic architecture of palaces built during the Parthian and Sassanian dynasties of Parsia. For example, the idea of having an arched entrance and a central dome in mosque is clearly one borrowed from pre-Islamic, Parsian architecture. Many forms of mosques have evolved in different regions of the Islamic world including those in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Mosque architecture mainly diffused into India during the reign of the Mughal empire in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Mughals brought their own form of architecture that included pointed, onion-shaped domes, as seen in Delhi's Jama Masjid, Atiya Mosque (founded in 1609 A.D. in the district of Tangail, Bangladesh), Khawaza Shahbaz Mosque (founded in 1679 A.D. in Dhaka), Miah Bari Mosque (founded in the 18th century in Karapur, district of Barisal) etc. Mughal style became the dominant feature in many of the old mosques in Indian sub-continent. The examples of the mosques with central single dome are Jore Bangla Mosque (founded in 1397 A.D. in Barobazar, Jhenidah), Chunakhola Mosque (founded in the early 15th century in the district of Bagerhat by Khan Jahan Ali), Ronbijoypur Mosque (founded in the middle of the 15th century in Bagerhat by Khan Jahan Ali), etc. The Momin Mosque is composed with completely differently style; made of wood-work with not a single nail in the structure, and it is a four sided pitch roof or chouchala covered with corrugated iron sheet, and to have more ventilation or circulation of freash air, the middle portion of the roof raised properly. This raised apex of the roof is again surmounted by dochala or two-sided pitch roof. Momin Mosque is an oblong shaped prayer hall measuring 7.47 meter by 3.55 meter with a 15 cm thick wall made of wood, entered from east by double leaves door. Corresponding to the frontal opening, the Qibla wall has the rectangular shaped projected space used as mihrab. This mihrab is articulated by a flat wooden arch support on two posts. The prayer hall stands on a high plinth; and at present the patent stone floor is finished by neat cement. There are six five-inch square wooden posts in each longer side and three posts in each shorter side support the roof frame of the mosque. Ventilation is the major factor which was taken into special consideration by designing the wall. The peripheral wall is divided vertically into three parts. The lower and upper parts are encompassed by fixed perforated wooden screen or panels with different designs. The middle portion consists of two types of window; pivotal and swing. Both of them are operated from inside. There are four swing windows in the longer side and two swing windows in the shorter side each. The intermediate space between the windows has a fixed panel from outside and pivotal panel from inside. All structural posts, purlins and rafters are made of Loha kath or Iron wood and Burma teak are used for paneling work on which all kinds of ornamentation was done. The wooden surface was painted with different colors, but during the restoration process only yellow color has been used.

Calligraphical design  Perhaps Muslim community uses the artistic handwriting to represent God because they denied representing God with images. Calligraphy is especially revered among Islamic arts since it was the primary means for the preservation of the Quran. Islamic calligraphy is associated with geometric Islamic art on the walls and ceilings of the mosques as well as on the page. Islamic calligraphy for Muslims is a visible expression of the highest art of all, the art of spiritual world. Arabic is written from right to left, and there are 28 letters, only 18 have distinct shape. There are six major scripts used in traditional calligraphy: Farsi, Naskh, Kufi, Diwani, Req’aa and Thuluth. Farsi also called Ta'liq was developed by Persians, is an unpretentious cursive script apparently in use since the early 9th century. Naskh was one of the earliest scripts to evolve. It gained popularity after being redesigned by the famous calligrapher Ibn Muqlah in the 9th century. Naskh style displays a very rhythmic line. Naskh is usually written with short horizontal stems—and with almost equal vertical depth above and below the medial line. The curves are full and deep, the uprights straight and vertical, and the words generally well spaced. Currently, Naskh is considered the supreme script for almost all Muslims and Arabs around the world. Kufi was the dominant priestly script in early times. It was created after the establishment of the two Muslim cities of Basrah and Kufah in the second decade of the Islamic era (8th century A.D.). The script has specific proportional measurements, along with pronounced angularity and squareness. It became known as al-Khat al-Kufi (Kufi script). Kufi script had a profound effect on all Islamic calligraphy. In contrast to its low verticals, Kufi has horizontal lines that are extended and this gives it a certain dynamic momentum. Diwani script is an Ottoman development parallel to Shikasteh (broken style). The script was largely developed by the accomplished calligrapher Ibrahim Munif in the late 15th century from the Turkish/Persian Ta'liq. Diwani reached its zenith in the 17th century, and it is excessively cursive and highly structured with its letters undotted and unconventionally joined together. Diwani also developed an ornamental variety called Deewani Jali which also was known as Humayuni (Imperial). The development of Diwani Jali is credited to Hafiz Uthman. The spaces between the letters are spangled with decorative devices which do not necessarily have any orthographic value. Deewani Jali is highly favored for ornamental purposes. Notably, Mr. Momin Uddin Akon introduced Diwani Jali style in the most of the calligraphical ornaments in Momin Mosque. Re'qaa evolved from Naskh and Thuluth. Re'qaa is rounded and densely structured with short horizontal stems, and the letter alif is never written with barbed heads. Thuluth script was first formulated in the 7th century during the Umayyad caliphate, but it did not develop fully until the late 9th century. Thuluth has enjoyed enormous popularity as an ornamental script for calligraphic inscriptions, titles, headings, and colophons. It is still the most important of all the ornamental scripts. Thuluth script is characterized by curved letters written with barbed heads. The letters are linked and sometimes intersecting, thus engendering a cursive flow of ample and often complex proportions.

It was originally built in 1906, and was then automated and converted to run on acetylene in 1921, and further modernised in 1994 (since when it has run on mains electricity); in 2019 it was converted to LED operation. Berry Head is reputedly the shortest lighthouse in Great Britain, but also one of the highest, being only tall, but above mean sea level. It was also said to be the deepest because the optic was originally turned by a weight falling down a deep shaft (though an electric motor was subsequently used). Placed within a revolving third-order dioptric optic, the light had an intensity of 4,200 candela and a range of ; it gave a double white flash every 15 seconds.

It was established in January 1999 in accordance with the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA 98) to provide independent oversight of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) activities. As mandated by RRA 98, TIGTA assumed most of the responsibilities of the IRS' former Inspection Service. TIGTA provides independent oversight of Department of the Treasury matters involving IRS activities, the IRS Oversight Board, and the IRS Office of Chief Counsel. TIGTA's audits, investigations, and inspections are designed to promote the fair administration of the Federal tax system. Although TIGTA is organizationally placed within the Department of the Treasury, and reports to the Secretary of the Treasury and to Congress, TIGTA functions independently of the Department and all other Treasury offices and bureaus. TIGTA's Office of Investigations protects the integrity of the IRS and its ability to collect tax revenue. It investigates allegations related to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement concerning IRS activities, and protects the IRS against external attempts to corrupt, threaten, or interfere with its employees. This mission is accomplished through proactive and reactive investigative programs. TIGTA operates a hotline unit in Washington, DC, for the intake of allegations of wrongdoing. Examples of specific allegations that should be reported include, but are not limited to: attempts by taxpayers to bribe IRS personnel; extortion or misuse of position by IRS personnel; assaults and/or threats by taxpayers against IRS employees; schemes involving the use of computer technology or mail that impersonate the IRS or IRS personnel; misconduct by tax practitioners (falsification of qualifications, theft of IRS tax remittances and theft of IRS tax refunds). TIGTA's ability to serve the public is dependent on the diligence of IRS employees in reporting wrongdoing. Any indication of fraud, waste, mismanagement, or abuse should be reported to TIGTA directly or through the employee's supervisor. IRS managers are responsible for ensuring that all allegations they receive are promptly reported to TIGTA. Federal law prohibits reprisal or retaliation against an employee who reports wrongdoing. The Office of Investigations (OI) investigates complaints and allegations against IRS employees. Special agents will conduct all leads to prove or disprove the elements of the violation, or to show that the issue cannot be resolved. The results of investigations are submitted to IRS management without recommendation as to any action to be taken. Misconduct by TIGTA employees should be reported to the Special Inquiries and Intelligence Division (SIID). The Division is responsible for three distinct missions. SIID is responsible for conducting sensitive investigations involving TIGTA employees, IRS Oversight Board Members, IRS Senior Executives (Grade 15 and above), IRS Chief Counsel employees, IRS Criminal Investigation employees, and IRS International employees located in Washington, D.C., and U.S. embassies abroad. SIID is also responsible for investigating allegations of fraud, waste and abuse involving IRS procurements and procurement-related misconduct by IRS employees and persons outside of the agency. Third, SIID is responsible for coordinating all criminal intelligence collection and dissemination within TIGTA nationwide. J. Russell George is the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.

The highlands are covered in bright \\"snow,\\" rising 5 km above the dark lava flows of the neighboring plain. Venus snow is a brightening of the radar reflection from the surface of Venus at high elevations. The \\"snow\\" appears to be a mineral condensate of lead sulfide and bismuth sulfide precipitated from the atmosphere at altitudes above . The nature of the \\"snow\\" was initially unknown. In radar images, smooth surfaces such as lava plains generally appear dark, while rough surfaces such as impact debris appear bright. The composition of the rock also alters the radar return: conductive material, or material with a high dielectric constant, appears brighter. It was therefore initially difficult to determine whether the high-altitude areas of Venus were different from the lowlands in chemical composition or in texture. Possible explanations included loose soil, different rates of weathering at high and low elevations, and chemical deposition at high elevation. It could not be water ice, which cannot exist in the extremely hot, dry conditions of the Venusian surface. Data from the radar mapper on the Pioneer Venus orbiter suggested an explanation in terms of chemical composition. It was hypothesized that the underlying rock contained iron pyrite or other metallic inclusions that would be very reflective. At the high temperatures found on the surface of Venus, these minerals would gradually evaporate. Faster weathering at high elevation might continually expose new material, causing the highlands to appear brighter than lowlands. High-resolution radar observations by the Magellan probe by 1995 began to favor the hypothesis that metallic compounds sublimate in lower, warmer altitudes and deposit in higher, cooler areas. Candidates included tellurium, pyrite, and other metal sulfides.

It was part of the Foolish Fatherland (Patria Boba) period at the beginning of the Spanish American wars of independence. Its capital was Bogotá, the former capital of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. Following the occupation of Spain during the Napoleonic Wars, Cundinamarca was one of the states (such as United Provinces of South America (Argentina) and the First Republic of Venezuela) who replaced its viceregal government with a local junta in the name of the deposed Ferdinand VII. Following the creation of juntas all over New Granada, the provinces started establishing their own autonomous governments. Unable to unify them into a single state, the Junta Suprema in Santafé (the former vice- royal capital and the center of the Province of Cundinamarca), which had been installed on July 20, 1810, called for constitutional assembly for the province. In March, 1811, the province convened a \\"Constituent Electoral College of the State of Cundinamarca,\\" which promulgated a constitution the following mont declaring the creation of the Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca, with Jorge Tadeo Lozano as its first president. The constitution followed the model of the Constitution of the United States, and established Cundinamarca as a Catholic and constitutional monarchy, under the absent Ferdinand VII (it would only declare full independence from Spain in August 1813). Antonio Nariño, who had been appointed as Mayor of the city of Santafé on August 30, 1811, started pushing for a strong centralist position from the newspaper he created, La Bagatela (or The Triffle). Nariño became a ruthless critic of Lozano, whom he accused of indecisiveness. The aggressive criticisms by Nariño and his followers led to a riot in the city on September 19, 1811, following which president Lozano and his vice president were forced to resign. Fearful of popular rioting, the legislature elected Nariño as president and conceded to his demands that increased the influence of the executive power. The conflict between centralist and federalist ideas that characterized the following years is called the Foolish Fatherland. While Cundinamarca, including the old capital and administrative machinery, advocated the establishment of a strong centralist government, other parts of the old viceroyalty banded together as the United Provinces of New Granada to support a federal structure. Unable to unify the country in a centralist state, and fearing the loss of power that would come as a consequence of federalism, Cundinamarca under Nariño became embroiled in Civil War against other provinces, particularly Tunja, where the Federalst Congress had settled. On November 26, 1812, Nariño left with his army to conquer Tunja. On December 2, 1812, his army faced a federalist army commanded by Antonio Ricaurte and Atanasio Girardot in the Battle of Ventaquemada, and was soundly defeated, having to retreat back to Bogota. The federalist troops, however, only started pursuing more than a week later. Following the defeat, and the subsequent declaration of independence from the Province of Socorro, Nariño resigned as soon as he arrived to the city, but not finding a suitable replacement, he was reinstalled as dictator. Nariño prepared to defend the city, which was sieged on December 24. Nevertheless, on January 9, 1813, in the Battle of San Victorino, Nariño's troops proved superior and the federalist armies were completely defeated. In June 1813, he was appointed dictator for life, and the following month, the Republic of Cundinamarca finally declared independence from the Monarchy. In July 1813, and motivated by his victory over the federalists, General Nariño began an intensive military campaign against the remaining Spanish and Royalist forces in the south, intending to reach Pasto and eventually Quito. Nariño's forces, known as the Army of the South, numbering 1500 to 2000 men, managed to capture Popayán in January 1814, but were utterly defeated in Pasto in May 1814, and Nariño was arrested and then sent to the Royal prison at Cádiz via Quito. The federalists took advantage of this to attack Bogota, which allowed General Simón Bolívar of the United Provinces to force terms in December 1814. By mid-1815, however, Pablo Morillo arrived with a large Spanish force and returned the region to submission to the since-restored Ferdinand. Morillo's campaign culminated with the capture of Santafé on May 6, 1816.

It first appeared in the mid-to-late 10th century, and by the 13th century had become the most frequent term used for the Byzantine army's standing regiments, persisting until the late 14th century. Origin of the term The term means \\"rotation of duties\\",On proposals by earlier scholars on the meaning of the term, cf. and first appears in the Tactica of Leo VI the Wise in the early 10th century for a generic body of troops. In a more technical use it came into use as an alternate term for a cavalry bandon, numbering between 50 and 400 men. In the 10th and 11th centuries, provincial allagia had some 50–150 men, while those of the central imperial army were closer to the upper limit, with circa 320–400 men. Allagia in the late Byzantine era From the late 11th century, as evidenced in the writings of Michael Attaleiates, the term also began to be used in a more specific sense for the troops of the imperial bodyguard. By the late 13th century, the term had largely replaced the earlier tagma in colloquial and technical (although not entirely in literary) usage to designate any standing regiment. Each allagion was headed by an allagatōr (). The mid-14th century writer Pseudo-Kodinos also mentions a court office, that of the archōn tou allagiou (, \\"master of the allagion\\"), which apparently appeared in the 1250s under Theodore II Laskaris and in Pseudo-Kodinos's time occupied the 53rd place in the palace hierarchy. He served as the second-in-command of the imperial escort. His uniform comprised a skiadion hat decorated with gold wire, a kaftan-like kabbadion in silk \\"as it is commonly used\\", a velvet-covered skaranikon with a red tassel on top, and a baton of office of plain smooth wood. The emperor's own allagion (i.e. his military retinue) seems to have been replaced by the two divisions of the rather obscure Paramonai corps, one on foot and one on horse. These, however, were still commanded, according to Pseudo-Kodinos, by an allagatōr each, while the protallagatōr (πρωταλλαγάτωρ, \\"first allagatōr\\") probably commanded the corps as a whole. According to Pseudo-Kodinos, the protallagatōr occupied the 54th position in the palace hierarchy. He led the rear of the emperor's escort, forcing any stragglers to hurry up and maintain formation. His uniform was identical to that of his superior, the archōn tou allagiou, except that instead of a staff he bore a gilded silver mace (matzouka), whose handle was covered in red silk, with a gilded tip on top and a gilded chain in the middle. Both the archōn tou allagiou and the protallagatōr were under the supervision of the megas primmikẽrios. Very few holders of any of the offices of archōn tou allagiou, protallagatōr or allagatōr are mentioned in the sources. The allagia of the provincial army were divided into two distinct groups: the \\"imperial allagia\\" (, basilika allagia) and the \\"great allagia\\" (, megala allagia). The former were found in Byzantine Asia Minor, while the latter in the Empire's European provinces only. With the gradual fall of Asia Minor to the Turks during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the \\"imperial allagia\\" finally disappeared. The \\"great allagia\\", of which three are known by name – the Thessalonian (), that of Serres (), and that of Bizye () – are first attested in 1286 and continue to be mentioned until 1355. Almost certainly, however, they date at least from the reign of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), and perhaps even before him to the Laskarid emperors of Nicaea who conquered these lands. They too disappeared as their provinces fell to the Serbs and the Ottoman Turks. The exact role, nature and structure of the European megala allagia are not fully clear. As their jurisdiction encompassed the regions around these cities, conforming roughly to the old themata of Thessalonica, Strymon, and Thrace respectively, they may represent an attempt to centralize control over the provincial military forces, at a time when political control was increasingly devolving from the capital to the periphery. How extensive their reach was is, however, open to question. It is known that their forces comprised both frontier troops providing garrisons for fortresses, as well as cavalry pronoias. In addition, they may have included small land-holders and mercenaries. As Mark Bartusis comments on the various attempts to explain their role, \\"at the one extreme the megala allagia were the central element in the late Byzantine army; every soldier who lived in the provinces and who had a military obligation [...] was a megaloallagitēs...\\", meaning that they represented a universal military organization involved in the recruitment and maintenance of all provincial forces, from which only the imperial guards and the personal retinues of local governors must be excluded. On the other extreme, the megala allagia may have been only a partial aspect of the late Byzantine military system, confined only to some provinces and from which foreign mercenaries were probably excluded. The office of tzaousios also occurs in the early 14th century in the context of the megala allagia of the region of Thessalonica. Its exact functions, however, within these units are unknown. The size of the allagia was apparently equivalent to the old banda at circa 300–500 troops; thus the Chronicle of the Morea records that Constantine Palaiologos had a force of 18 allagia or 6,000 cavalry troops at his command in the Morea the early 1260s.

The series start during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor when Qiao Zhiyong, a young scholar, leaves for Beijing for the imperial examination. The death of his sick elder brother Qiao Zhiguang forces Zhiyong to return home without sitting for the papers. His sister-in- law, Madam Cao, compels Qiao to take on the family's business, although he is initially reluctant to do so because he prefers academic studies. But with the Qiao's family business in arrears, Qiao marries Lu Yuhan, daughter of the wealthy Shanxi merchant Lu Dake, against his will, to save his family from bankruptcy. As a result, he forgoes marrying his childhood sweetheart, maternal cousin Jiang Xueying. Under his charge, the family business becomes profitable again. Zhiyong's wife Lu Yuhan wins his heart after a series of selfless acts for his cause. Working in tandem with a former scholar, Sun Maocai, who becomes Qiao's advisor, Qiao Zhiyong opens up tea routes from the Wuyi Mountains, the heart of Chinese tea cultivation, to the Russian Empire and becomes a renowned tea merchant. Success with tea merchandising stirs Qiao's interest in banking. With his father-in-law's help Qiao becomes a famous financier, determined to achieve a dream of facilitating national trade by erecting banking posts (票號, an early form of banking institution) throughout China. His fame however lands him in serious trouble with the Qing imperial court and with Empress Dowager Cixi, who forces him to finance the government's campaign against the Taiping rebels. The series ends as an elderly Qiao achieves his goal – erecting banking houses throughout China to facilitate trade (汇通天下，货通天下) – but at the expense of spending ten years under ignominious house arrest, and with the country's wealth drained after the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-5 and the Boxer Protocol of 1901.

On August 5, 1949, it struck Ecuador's Tungurahua Province southeast of its capital Ambato and killed 5,050 people. Measuring 6.4 on the scale, it originated from a hypocenter 15 km beneath the surface. The nearby villages of Guano, Patate, Pelileo, and Pillaro were destroyed, and the city of Ambato suffered heavy damage. The earthquake flattened buildings and subsequent landslides caused damage throughout the Tungurahua, Chimborazo, and Cotopaxi Provinces. It disrupted water mains and communication lines and opened a fissure into which the small town of Libertad sank. Moderate shaking from the event extended as far away as Quito and Guayaquil. Earthquakes in Ecuador stem from two major interrelated tectonic areas: the subduction of the Nazca Plate under the South American Plate and the Andean Volcanic Belt. The 1949 Ambato earthquake initially followed an intersection of several northwest-southeast-trending faults in the Inter- Andean Valley which were created by the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge. Strata of rock cracked as the earthquake ruptured the faults, sending out powerful shock waves. Today threats exist throughout the country from both interplate and intraplate seismicity.  Background  Earthquakes are common in Ecuador. Near the Nazca subduction zone the recorded history of interplate earthquakes spans 80 years. At the time it struck the 1949 Ambato earthquake was the second-worst earthquake in Ecuador's modern history topped only by the 1797 Riobamba earthquake, and the most devastating earthquake in the Western Hemisphere since the 1944 San Juan earthquake. Several major earthquakes have occurred throughout the country since 1949, including the 1987 Ecuador earthquakes and the 1997 Ecuador earthquake. The 2007 Peru earthquake also affected the country.  Geology  The Nazca Plate is being subducted under the South American Plate, generating volcanism and extensive seismicity. Much of South American seismic activity and volcanism originates from subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate under the continental South American Plate and subduction of the Pacific's lithosphere under the South American continent. This seismicity extends for along the continent's western edge and probably stems from a region of northeast-trending faulting near the Ecuadorian Trench. The region of faulting may actually function as its own microplate. The Carnegie Ridge is sliding under Ecuadorian land, causing coastal uplift and volcanism. The ridge's movement may also have changed the type of faulting along the coast, causing strike-slip faults (faults that move horizontally past each other). Evidence of this subduction altering the course of faulting is found at the Yaquina fault, which, unlike the rest of the Panama Basin faults, trends to the west instead of north-south, indicating that the Carnegie Ridge may be colliding with the continental mass of Ecuador. This collision created northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest-trending faults in the region, and with that, caused strong earthquakes in Riobamba in 1797 and Alausi in 1961. Several of the northwest-southeast-trending faults converge in the Inter-Andean Valley where the 1949 Ambato earthquake took place. The hypocenter of the earthquake occurred beneath the surface, under a mountain from Ambato. Nearby faults ruptured, breaking rock strata and sending shock waves to the surface capable of bringing down entire buildings. Life reported that local seismologists first placed the earthquake's magnitude at 7.5, but the official measurement was later revised to 6.4 .  Damage and casualties  The ruins of homes in Pelileo after the earthquake The earthquake was preceded by a foreshock, which, although modest, was strong enough to cause chaos and force people to flee from their homes into the streets. The main shock originated southeast of Ambato. When the primary shock hit Ambato's main cathedral and military barracks collapsed, as did most of the city's buildings, scores of young girls preparing for their First Communion perished in the cathedral. The shaking ruptured water mains, disabled communication lines, opened cracks in the earth, reduced bridges to rubble, and derailed a train. The earthquake demolished buildings in rural hamlets; closer to the nearest mountains of the Andes, landslides destroyed roads and blocked rivers. The village of Libertad near Pelileo sank into a huge hole about in diameter with all of its 100 inhabitants. Shaking up to intensity IV extended as far away as Quito and Guayaquil. Initial reports (around August 7) estimated the death toll at 2,700 people. The cities of Patate and Pelileo suffered the most with 1,000 and 1,300 dead respectively. In Ambato reports of the death toll ranged from 400 to 500, and the Ecuadorean Embassy in Washington, D.C., estimated that 1,000 to more than 2,000 people were injured. The town of Pillaro, destroyed by the quake, had more than 20 dead, and in Latacunga, 11 were killed and 30 injured; 50 homes, two churches, and the local government building were also ruined. Fifteen other towns and cities were also badly affected, including Guano which was devastated. Later counts assumed around 3,200 casualties in Pelileo; the total death toll estimates were adjusted to around 4,000 people. Officials reported that many of the dead had been inside buildings as they buckled or were killed by flooding brought about by the blockage of a drainage canal. Others were crushed by landslides from nearby mountains. No homes in the city of Pelileo were left standing, many buildings were flattened, and large cracks formed in the ground. In Ambato alone 75 percent of the homes still standing had to be demolished. On August 8, an aftershock with \\"considerable strength\\" struck near Ambato. The final death toll according to the United States Geological Survey was 5,050. The earthquake severely affected some 30 communities and left approximately 100,000 people homeless.  Relief efforts  Ecuador's President Galo Plaza Lasso flew to Ambato to take personal charge of the primary relief efforts. Plaza directed rescue efforts for two days as airlifts from Quito dropped supplies. A group of Red Cross volunteers and medical supplies were sent on American aircraft. The United States Army sent two relief teams equipped with serum and blood plasma. The mayor of Miami along with seven other politicians began a fund-raising campaign for medical needs and clothing and coordinated the distribution of of Rexall drugs. Several nearby countries sent airplanes carrying medicine and food. A local fund- raising effort collected 250,000 Ecuadorian sucres (approximately US$14,815 1949) within two hours of its launch. Plaza said \\"We have not lost our courage. Neither Ambato nor Ecuador shall cry any more, but begin to work.\\" On August 7 a plane carrying 34 rescue workers from the Shell Oil Company crashed from Ambato leaving no survivors. Disease began to spread in Pelileo within days of the earthquake, which prompted a team of American soldiers, acting as relief workers, to order water purification devices and DDT airdrops to cleanse the area of airborne agents. Sick victims were quarantined and prevented from leaving the city.  Aftermath  A hospital ruined by the earthquake in Ambato; almost 75 percent of the city's remaining buildings had to be demolished. The earthquake considerably impacted a number of cities: it destroyed Guano, Patate, Pelileo, Pillaro, and one-third of Ambato. The city of Ambato was a \\"scene of anguish and pain\\" described by \\"scores of little funerals winding their way through the debris\\". The brand-new hospital had been reduced to four walls, and most of the buildings in town were demolished. In Pelileo relief workers found victims feeding buried people through holes in the ground. In the days following the earthquakes aftershocks occurred and torrential rains ensued. In an effort to help the inhabitants a festival of fruit and flowers was held on June 29, 1950. The festival was a success and became an annual event that is celebrated each year during Carnaval and is now an important tourist attraction. Ambato was completely rebuilt after the earthquake. The city's main church, the Iglesia Matriz de Ambato, was replaced by a new cathedral known as Iglesia La Catedral in 1954. Pelileo was rebuilt on a new site from its previous location.  Current situation  Ambato is frequently visited by tourists traveling on the Pan-American Highway. The city is well known for its extensive market, which sells a wide array of items, including local delicacies and flowers, and for its quintas — old estates that serve as historic parks — some of which pre-date the earthquake. Ecuador is still at risk from earthquakes: Both intraplate (such as those in March 1987) and interplate earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, as it can be much more powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.

These fertilizers mitigate some of the negative aspects of urea fertilization, such as fertilizer burn. The coatings release the urea either when penetrated by water, as with sulfur, or when broken down, as with polymers.  Overview  Urea is widely used as a nitrogen fertilizer. Its high solubility in water makes it useful for liquid application, and it has a much lower risk of causing fertilizer burn than other chemicals such as calcium cyanide or ammonium nitrate. However, the risk of fertilizer burn with urea can be unacceptably high in some situations, such as higher temperatures. The high water-solubility of urea can be disadvantageous in some cases as well. One particular technique to mitigate these disadvantages has been to encapsulate prills of urea with less-soluble chemicals. These coatings permit the gradual release of urea in a controlled fashion, allowing for less-frequent applications.  Sulfur-coated urea  Sulfur-coated urea, or SCU, fertilizers release nitrogen via water penetration through cracks and micropores in the coating. Once water penetrates through the coating, nitrogen release is rapid. The particles of fertilizer may in turn be sealed with wax to slow release further still, making microbial degradation necessary to permit water penetration. The size of fertilizer particles may also be varied in order to vary the time at which nitrogen release occurs. Sulfur-coated products typically range from 32% to 41% elemental nitrogen by weight. The sulfur coating process was originally developed by the Tennessee Valley Authority. Sulfur-coated urea products can only be applied in granular form, and thus cannot be applied via liquid fertilization methods. It is not uncommon to find empty sulfur husks in turf once the nitrogen is released. Another disadvantage has to do with the relatively large particle size of sulfur-coated urea fertilizers, which makes their use on closely mown surfaces like putting greens impractical. However, more recently, materials with smaller particle sizes have been developed, permitting the use of sulfur-coated ureas on putting greens.  Polymer-coated urea  Polymer-coated urea, also called plastic-coated urea, or PCU, fertilizers can permit a more precise rate of nitrogen release than sulfur- coated urea products. It's possible to produce polymer-coated products where the nitrogen release can be delayed for 10 months after application. The primary disadvantage of polymer-coated urea products is their relatively high cost compared to sulfur-coated urea.  Combination products  Products that use a combination of sulfur-coating and polymer-coating also exist. Typically, these products consist of urea, coated with a layer of sulfur, which is in turn coated with a layer of polymer. Each coating layer is generally less than the normal thickness for the individual processes. These products are generally used as less-expensive alternatives to purely plastic-coated products, while still providing precise nitrogen release characteristics.

Traditionally this tribe has been used as a wastebasket taxon to accommodate genera of Faboideae which exhibit actinomorphic, rather than zygomorphic floral symmetry and/or incompletely differentiated petals and free stamens. Various morphological and molecular analyses indicated that Sophoreae as traditionally circumscribed was polyphyletic. This led to a re-circumscription of Sophoreae, which resulted in the transfer of many genera to other tribes (Amburaneae, Angylocalyceae, Baphieae, Camoensieae, the Cladrastis clade, Exostyleae, Leptolobieae, Ormosieae, Podalyrieae, and the Vataireoids). This also necessitated the inclusion of two former tribes, Euchresteae and Thermopsideae, in the new definition of Sophoreae. Tribe Sophoreae, as currently circumscribed, consistently forms a monophyletic clade in molecular phylogenetic analyses. The Sophoreae arose 40.8 ± 2.4 million years ago (in the Eocene). Description of morphological synapomorphies has yet to be undertaken, but members of this tribe can be distinguished by the relatively simple flowers, unspecialized pinnate leaves, accumulation of quinolizidine alkaloids, and the presence of free stamens. The tribe does have a node-based definition: the crown clade originating from the most recent common ancestor of Bolusanthus speciosus (Bolus) Harms and Sophora davidii (Franch.) Pavol..

Baillie was the third son of Hugh Baillie of Dochfour, Inverness and his wife Emilia Fraser, the daughter of Alexander Fraser. Joseph Gaston Baillie Bulloch. A history and genealogy of the family of Baillie of Dunain, Dochfour and Lamington : with a short sketch of the family of McIntosh, Bulloch, and other families. His early life was obscure and he suffered \\"fatal neglect\\" in formal education.R. G. Thorne The House of Commons, 1790–1820, Volume 1 He entered the army in early life and served in part of the American war. He was first in the West Indies in 1759–60, serving with the 4th Foot in Martinique, as his 1835 Inverness Courier obituary makes clear. Baillie himself seems to have been a staff officer to General Howe at the Siege of Havana in the adjutant's department. He then transferred to the 19th Regiment (later the Green Howards) as a lieutenant, and retired on half-pay. He then seems to have spent most of the next 15 years in partnership with his brothers, Alexander and James, who had begun a partnership in St Kitts known as Smith and Baillies, which was eventually based in Grenada and later in St Vincent as the partnership of Garraway and Baillie. A 1779 letter from his brother James to his cousin, William Baillie of Dunain, then serving in India,(HCA (Highland Council Archives) D456/A/13) indicates that he had returned to Britain in about 1774 and settled in Bristol. A 1775 letter from John Alves in Inverness to the same William Baillie, Alves's brother-in-law confirms that he had bought at the same time, for £10,000, the estate of Kinmylies, Inverness, from the army agent, George Ross of Pitkerrie, who intended to concentrate on developing Cromarty. Alves also indicates that he was believed in 1775 to have married in the West Indies, marrying Mary Gurley of St Peter's Hope, St Vincent, in 1777. He founded what became the firm of Evan Baillie, Son & Co in Bristol, and was a common councilman for Bristol in 1785. He was sheriff of Bristol for 1786–87 but declined becoming mayor. In 1789 he was member of a committee of merchants to defend the slave trade, in all branches of which he had from time to time invested and financed. During the French Revolutionary War he raised the Bristol Volunteer Infantry in 1797 and served as their Lieutenant-Colonel (Colonel in 1798). After the short-lived Peace of Amiens he re-raised them as the Royal Bristol Volunteer Infantry.Brig H. Bullock, 'Gloucestershire Volunteers, 1795–1815', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 38, No 154 (June 1960), pp. 76–82.Col R.M.

On the death of his brother Alexander in 1798 Baillie succeeded to the family estates in Inverness-shire. He was also partner in an Inverness hemp manufacturers and other businesses. He continued to purchase more land in Scotland as a result of concerns about the effects of the war with France and effects of abolition of slavery. In 1802 Baillie became an alderman of Bristol. Also in 1802, he was elected unopposed as Member of Parliament for Bristol. He was unopposed again in 1806 and 1807. He noted how feeble were attempts in parliament to oppose slave trade abolition bill but he was not among those who made last stand against it. By 1811, he was suffering poor health and was concerned for his son Peter (by then MP for the Inverness burghs) who died in 1812. He therefore decided not to stand in the 1812 election. Baillie retired to Scotland and left the business operations to his sons. He resigned as alderman of Bristol in 1821 pleading old age, but survived to the age of 94. His wife Mary Gurley was the daughter of Peter Gurley of St. Vincent. Their sons Peter Baillie, Hugh Duncan Baillie and James Evan Baillie all became members of parliament. Baillie's brother James Baillie was also an MP and West Indies merchant.

The raid, carried out by men of the No. 8 (Guards) Commando and the Royal Australian Engineers, was a complete success. However it did not end the siege; that continued until November 1941, when the Allied advance during Operation Crusader reached the town. Background During 1941, the British Commando formation Layforce were tasked to carry out a campaign of harassment and dislocation against enemy forces in the Mediterranean.Chappell, p.15. At the time that Layforce was raised, the British were in the ascendency in the theatre, as they had largely defeated the Italians. It was felt that the Commandos could be employed in the capture of the island of Rhodes.Moreman, p.20. However, the arrival of the Afrika Korps in Cyrenaica and the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece greatly changed the strategic outlook. By the time Layforce arrived in Egypt in March the situation had become dire.Saunders, p.52. The deployment of forces to Greece meant that the Commandos became the only troops in general reserve. As the strategic situation worsened, it became increasingly difficult to employ them in the manner intended, as they were called upon as reinforcements to the rest of the army.Saunders, p.55. In May 1941 the majority of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete. Almost as soon as they landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south. They were ill-equipped for this type of operation, as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the Commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, the vast majority of the Commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war.Saunders, p.57. By the end of the operation about 600 of the 800 Commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing or wounded; only 179 Commandos managed to get off the island.Chappell, p.16. Shortly after being evacuated from Crete, a detachment of 75 men from No. 8 (Guards) Commando was sent to Tobruk to assist the Allied forces holding out against the Axis powers that had the city under siege.Mountbatten, p.39. Raid Allied trench on the Tobruk perimeter The Twin Pimples was a feature in the Axis lines surrounding Tobruk. It was a defensive strong point consisting of two hills very close together that dominated the opposing Allied lines and at the time of the raid was held by units of the Italian Army. The 18th King Edward's Own Cavalry, normally part of the 3rd Indian Motor Brigade, held the line across from the Twin Pimples when it was decided to take out the Italian position. The No. 8 Commando was selected to carry out the operation and for some days prior they conducted patrols with the Indians to get to know the lay of the land. The plan called for three officers and 40 men of No. 8 Commando and a small number of Australian Engineers (to deal with ammunition dumps and gun emplacements) to cross the Italian forward positions to the road that they used to bring up supplies and then follow the road to the rear of the Twin Pimples and engage the position from behind. The 18th Cavalry were to carry out a diversionary raid just before the commando assault to divert the defenders' attention.Mountbatten, p.40. The man chosen to lead the raid was Captain M. Keely, the second in command was Captain Dunne and the third officer was Lieutenant Lewes On the night of the raid, 17/18 July, half the Commandos were armed with Thompson submachine guns and the other half with Lee–Enfield rifles with bayonets fixed. All carried hand grenades and every third man wore a groundsheet slung bandoleer fashion to use as a stretcher. The Commandos left their own lines at 23:00 hours on 17 July and crossed the Italian forward positions and main lines undetected. Upon reaching the supply road they had to take cover and wait, as the attack was planned for 01:00 hours on 18 July. They moved closer to their objective just prior to the start of the diversionary attack by the 18th Cavalry. The diversion was a success, and Italian machine-gun fire and very lights were directed towards the Indian cavalrymen. The Commandos managed to get within on the Twin Pimples before being challenged. The challenge was answered by a frontal attack by the Commandos. So as not to confuse their own forces with the Italians in the darkness, the password Jock was used when a position had been taken. The fire fight lasted about four minutes and the Australian Engineers planted explosives on several mortars and an ammunition dump. The planners had estimated that the Commandos could spend no longer than 15 minutes on the Italian position before it was engaged by the Italian artillery. The raiders had only got about from the Twin Pimples when the Italian artillery started to come down onto their own position. Aftermath The cost of the raid to the Commandos was five wounded, one of whom later died of his wounds. The No. 8 Commando, together with the rest of Layforce, was disbanded soon after. The operational difficulties that had been exposed, combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the commando concept, had largely served to make them ineffective.Saunders, p.61.Chappell, p.17. Two members of No. 8 Commando, David Stirling and Jock Lewes, would form the Special Air Service by the end of July 1941.Molinari, p.22. Tobruk would remain under siege until relieved by Operation Crusader in November 1941.Maughan, p.442. The only soldier to be killed on this raid was Corporal John “Jackie” Edward Trestrail Maynard of the Duke of Cornwall's light Infantry and No 8 (Guards) Commando.

Rookies =Andy McNally= :Portrayed by Missy Peregrym Andrea \\"Andy\\" McNally is one of the series protagonists. She is driven by the desire to do the right thing even if it means not following procedure. Her father, Tommy McNally, was formerly a homicide detective before he burned out. As a result, McNally carries her father's baggage, trying to prove herself. Her mother, Claire, is a social services worker who abandoned them when Andy was a teenager. She studied Sociology/Psychology before becoming a cop and she was an A student. McNally was assigned to Oliver Shaw, who was mentored by her father when he was a rookie. Her first day begins disastrously; she was left to pursue two suspects on foot on her own as she had forgotten to turn her radio on and arrests them for drug possession, only to find out that one of them, Sam Swarek, was actually an undercover cop from her division and was two weeks away from a potential bust of a distribution ring – this was the premise for her love-hate relationship with him when he was assigned as her training officer. When Shaw is promoted to Acting Staff Sergeant in season 5, she volunteers to take his place as a training officer. Like her first day as a rookie, her first day as a training officer also ends disastrously when her rookie Duncan Moore contaminated the crime scene and offended a grieving widow when his cellphone started ringing while McNally was speaking with her. After meeting in the pilot episode, McNally begins a relationship with homicide detective Luke Callaghan, and the two move in together at the end of season 1, although she previously kissed and almost had sex with Swarek, her training officer, before walking out on him, something that leaves them in discomfort for several episodes. She later becomes engaged to Callaghan but breaks up with him after he slept with his ex-girlfriend, Detective Jo Rosati. She finally admits that she has feelings for Swarek, but he has already left on an undercover mission. The last three episodes of season 2 show viewers the beginning of Swarek and McNally's relationship, even though he is undercover, which leads them both to suspension for \\"conduct unbecoming\\" when they are discovered. In the beginning of season 3, McNally returns from a trip after her three months' suspension and gets her job back as well as restarting her relationship with Swarek. When her mother suddenly appears in her life due to a work case, she decides to let her back in after she asked for a second chance. After Detective Barber's death, Swarek breaks up with her, which causes a lot of pain for McNally. After a month and a half, and in a life-threatening situation when she is holding a grenade, Swarek says to her that he loves her and then he tries to get her back. Then Detective Callaghan asks her to participate in a task force, which will keep her isolated and away from 15 Division during the mission. She accepts but has to leave immediately, which leaves Swarek drinking at the Penny (the local bar) while waiting for her. In the first episode of season 4, when she returns, she finds out he has been dating Officer Marlo Cruz while she was gone. Later on, Nick confesses his feelings for McNally, and the two embark on a new relationship. When Sam gets shot in the season 4 finale, she goes in the ambulance with Sam, and then confesses that she still loves him. It is shown in season 5 that the two are together again. At the end of season 5, McNally is caught in a bomb attack at the station, but escapes unharmed. In the season 6 episode \\"Home Run\\", Swarek proposes to her on a boating trip and she happily accepts. They marry in the season finale, with her best friend Traci serving as the maid of honor. =Dov Epstein= :Portrayed by Gregory Smith Dov Epstein is one of the series protagonists. Described as the \\"dork\\" of the batch of rookies assigned to 15 Division, he was a sickly asthmatic kid (he has been seen using his inhaler a number of times in the first two seasons) who watched reruns of Starsky and Hutch. His parents were \\"hippies\\", but his grandmother paid for him to have a private education. He is often shown to be overeager to get involved in everything even when it is not necessary for him to do so, much to the chagrin of his more senior colleagues. This characteristic has gotten him into trouble many times, so much so he has been told to \\"slow it down\\". However, in season 2, Epstein's desire to be heavily involved enables him to save a man's life. He is Chris Diaz's best friend and roommate, and later Gail's roommate as well when she moves in with them. In season 2, he meets and becomes involved with Sue, a bomb technician from ETF, whom he always tries to impress, thinking he does not deserve her. They break up when he develops feelings for Crystal, the sister of the boy he shot and killed. In season 4 he has a one-night stand with Chloe Price, a woman he met in a bar and later finds out to be Frank's god-daughter as well as 15 Division's latest officer. By the middle of the season, however, the two of them have started a relationship. When Chloe is shot on the job, Epstein finds out that she is still married to an officer from her old division, Wes. He forgives her for this, but after he discovers that Wes kissed her and she hid the evidence from him, he breaks up with her, much to Chloe's dismay. They later get back together in the near end of season 6. =Gail Peck= :Portrayed by Charlotte Sullivan Gail Peck is one of the series protagonists. She spent a few years as a half-goth. Underneath her caustic exterior, Gail is vulnerable and feels lonely. Because of her connections to high-ranking officials in the police force she is often seen by others as getting preferential treatment. She comes from a family of cops; her mother is a superintendent, her father is an inspector, her brother Steve a successful narcotics detective, and her godfather is the chief of police. Because of this, she feels the need to prove to herself and others that she can do the job without help, which further isolates her. In the first season, she develops a relationship with fellow rookie Chris Diaz. However, the two break up in season 2 because Chris believes that she likes Dov. In the third season it is revealed that she was previously engaged to the new rookie, Nick Collins, with whom she begins a new relationship. Later, she was kidnapped by a cab driver after working undercover as an escort and was rescued. When she takes the fall for a shooting in the 15 Division, her job is questioned, but they give it back to her with the condition that she will be treated as a new rookie. Gail ends up isolating herself between her and her friends due to the way she treats Chloe. Due to jealousy and unresolved feelings, she claims to have cheated on Nick with a detective who worked with him and Andy during their sting operation. She and Nick broke up. Later in season 4, she ends up meeting and befriending Holly, a forensic specialist, new friend, and lesbian. The two share a brief kiss in the coat closet at Frank and Noelle's wedding and kiss again after Gail is shot at in the penultimate episode of season 4. The two begin a new, tentative relationship. At the end of season 5, Gail tells her she decided to adopt Sophie, the orphaned daughter of a woman killed in a case Gail worked on, but Holly tells her that she has accepted a job in San Francisco and wanted Gail to come with her. It is presumed that the two broken up in season 6. Following the events in \\"Ninety Degrees\\", she becomes estranged from her father after Steve confesses to his involvement in Commissioner Santana's corruption scandal to spare her from going against her conscience and lying in court. In the season 6 finale \\"74 Epiphanies\\", she hooks up with Detective Frankie Anderson at Sam and Andy's wedding. =Traci Nash= :Portrayed by Enuka Okuma Traci Nash is one of the series protagonists. The calm in the eye of the storm and the consummate confidant, Traci is the anchor for her fellow rookies. She is also practical and responsible, likely the result of having had a child, Leo, while in high school. She is a single mother trying to find the balance between her work and her family. Complications arise both at work and at home as she once dated Detective Jerry Barber until she decided to try to get back together with her son's father, Dex. She is always trying to focus on her son and do everything that is best for him. However, this sometimes gets in the way of her being a police officer. She later starts a serious relationship with Detective Barber, culminating in an engagement. In season 3, Traci becomes a detective in training. She is devastated when Detective Barber is murdered in the line of duty. In season 4, Gail's brother, Steve Peck, returns to 15 Division. He is a detective from Guns and Gangs and he develops feelings for Nash. She is wary at first to start a new relationship with him, after Jerry's death. She is also worried about her son Leo getting attached to another man. But Peck proves to her that he is serious about her and the two start dating. After she finds out about Steve's involvement in the corruption and the bombing, she gets devastated and break things off with him. Traci was first assigned to Noelle Williams as a rookie. Her dedication and empathy for young victims earns her the respect of her more senior colleagues. Of her fellow rookies from the first season, she has risen through the ranks the fastest, having become a detective. In the season 6 finale, she was announced as the newly promoted detective sergeant and head of the Guns and Gangs. =Chris Diaz= :Portrayed by Travis Milne Chris Diaz is one of the series protagonists. He is often seen as taking the \\"by the book\\" approach. He believes in the chain of command, following orders, doing the right thing and above all, he believes in defending the weak. Despite this seemingly good trait, it makes him unable to take initiative. He was brought up in a small black-and-white town. He becomes involved in a relationship with Gail Peck until he is forced to notify the authorities of corruption that Peck's brother's partner was involved in. This temporarily costs him the relationship with Peck. However, the two reconcile and are seen happily together in the beginning of season 2. Their relationship becomes strained later when he thinks that she has feelings for Dov. He accepts his role as a dad after being confronted with a baby by his previous girlfriend in the series, Denise. He considers a transfer to Timmins at the end of the third season because Denise does not want to live in the city. She thinks it is dangerous, and he does not want to be away from his kid. In the fifth episode of season 4, Chris accepted his transfer to Timmins early and leaves, only saying goodbye to Oliver. However, he reappears in the ninth episode of season 4 when he comes to visit for the long weekend with Denise and Christian. Christian is later kidnapped while under the care of Andy and Nick, and it is later to be revealed that he was kidnapped by his biological father, Gene McKenzie. In episode 10, it is revealed that Chris transferred back to 15 Division, hence implying that he and Denise were no longer together. Dov later discovers that Chris is becoming addicted to cocaine, and Diaz takes some personal time-off to recover. In season 6, he gets involved in a relationship with Inspector Jarvis's wife, Jamie. =Nick Collins= :Portrayed by Peter Mooney Nick Collins is a rookie introduced in season 3. Collins served in the Canadian Army for four years and served a tour of duty in Afghanistan. He is dedicated to his job and his friends and is extremely loyal to the point where he has risked his own life several times to save his colleagues. Collins' parents were killed in a hit and run accident when he was twelve. His brother Finn was paralyzed and they lost touch over the years. After his parents' death, he lived with an uncle but ran away and was subsequently sent to a group home when he was caught stealing a car. By coincidence, Collins runs into the driver who was responsible for the accident at a bar. He nearly kills the man but is stopped by Juliet Ward. It is said that he was engaged to Gail Peck, and they were ready to marry in Las Vegas before he enlisted. When he comes back, they start a new relationship. His military training and experience has been utilized by his colleagues, especially in cases involving firearms or a hostile situation. In the season 3 finale he is selected as the other officer to participate in Callaghan's task force, and while on the task force, he develops feelings for Andy. He eventually breaks up with Gail when he finds out that she slept with someone else. He was with Andy at the park when Chris' son, Christian, was kidnapped by his biological father in \\"What I Lost\\". He and Andy sleep together in the same episode. When Sam Swarek is shot at the end of season 4, Andy confesses to Nick that she still loves Sam. Afterwards in season 5, it is indicated that they were no longer together, although he is on friendly terms with both Andy and Sam. Sometime at the end of season 5, he meets Juliet Ward, an Internal Affairs officer undercover as a street cop placed in 15 Division, and starts to fall for her and pursues her. After Nick confronts the driver involved in the accident that killed his parents and paralyzed his brother, he sleeps with Juliet, and the two appear to be sneaking around afterwards. When she finally tells Nick that is IA, he is upset by this. On her way to the airport, he pulls her over and decides to go to Vancouver to be with Juliet. In the season 6 finale, he states his intention to transfer to the ETF. =Chloe Price= :Portrayed by Priscilla Faia Chloe Price is one of the series protagonists. She appears for the first time in season 4, when she is first introduced as a one-night stand of Dov's and then later revealed to be Frank's goddaughter and the newest rookie to be transferred to 15 Division. Dov later finds out that she was still married, but had never gotten a divorce. When her ex-husband kisses her while she is wearing a camera, Chloe attempts to hide the evidence. But when Dov discovers it, he breaks up with her. Later, Chloe tells Dov to let his anger out on her, and he gets frustrated then kisses her, implying they are back together. Price is known for her cheerful, bubbly demeanor and has a good relationship with all her colleagues. She is transparent – whatever she is feeling will be exhibited in her facial expressions and she is unable to hide anything. Old Guard =Sam Swarek= :Portrayed by Ben Bass Sam Swarek is a detective and one of the series protagonists. He is known to his superiors as a \\"rogue cop\\" because he prefers to follow his instincts instead of the book. Formerly an undercover officer working on a money laundering-cum- drug trafficking operation, his cover was exposed when McNally arrested him, believing him to be a suspect in a murder case. He returns to 15 Division as a training officer, awaiting a position to open up in Guns and Gangs. In season 4 he is promoted to detective. Swarek is known to shut down and bottle up his emotions, instead taking it out by punching inanimate objects, especially his locker. From Season 4 onwards, he begins opening up to Andy and his long-time friend Oliver Shaw, who are the only people he has confided in. He is extremely loyal to his friends and put his career on the line several times to protect them. In the season 1 episode \\"Hot and Bothered\\", Andy, upset and confused, goes to see him at night and almost sleeps with him. This makes their relationship awkward afterward, but the two talk and make amends later. Although McNally is his love interest, he insists that their relationship is strictly professional. But in season 2, there still might be hope for McNally and him because of McNally's fiance Luke Callaghan cheating on her. During the end of season's 2 \\"Best Laid Plans\\", he went back into undercover operations before he had the chance to become romantically involved with McNally. However, they meet in the following episode and finally hook up. After getting suspended, he asks Andy to have a real relationship, but she leaves town to keep her job, since one of the terms of the suspension was for Swarek and McNally to not see each other, which leaves him disoriented. In the beginning of season 3, Andy convinces him to restart the relationship, although he wants to take it slow. When Andy's mother reappears in her life, he investigates her, and we see that he doesn't like or trust Claire because he blames her for Andy's pain. When Detective Barber dies, he goes into a dark place and starts to question Andy's instincts as a cop. He then wonders how much he will sacrifice for their relationship, so he breaks up with her saying that he cannot take it anymore. Everyone tells him how foolish he is for what he's done, but he has already noticed. When he sees Andy terrified and holding a grenade, he confesses his love for her. Then he tries to convince her that breaking up was a mistake, that he will do anything to make it up to her, but she is hurt and not sure he means it. He asks her for drinks, but he is left waiting as she is already gone for the task force without talking to him. In season 4, he becomes detective and has been dating Officer Marlo Cruz. He was shot by Kevin Ford in the last episode of season 4, but recovers. In season 5, he rekindles his relationship with McNally, and later proposes to her in mid- season 6. On the first episode of season 6, Marlo confesses to him that she's pregnant, and this causes a strain in his and Andy's relationship for some time. He and Oliver Shaw begin to have suspicions about corruption within the police force during season 5 and 6, which is confirmed when Police Commissioner Santana and Steve Peck gets arrested. In the season 6 finale, Swarek marries McNally at a small church wedding with their colleagues and both their fathers present. Shaw, one of his few close friends, was his best man. Swarek owns a goldendoodle named Boo Radley, whom he bought for McNally (as he promised after they previously broken up) before they get married. For most of the first four seasons, Swarek is largely an enigma. He never spoke of his family or opens up to anyone, despite being popular with his colleagues. In \\"Big Nickel\\", he tells McNally that his sister Sarah was attacked when he was a kid, which was why he became a cop. When he was shot in the season 4 finale, it is revealed that he had no next of kin listed and it took Nick Collins several hours to track down Sarah (Robin Brûlé), who reveals that she has not spoken to or seen her brother in years. It is not until season 5 that Swarek's painful childhood is fully revealed, but only after McNally's persistent questioning. His father Jay Swarek (Nicholas Campbell) was an abusive alcoholic who was \\"in and out of prisons all our lives\\" and used to hit his wife and two children to the point where the police have been called. Sarah, whom Sam affectionately calls \\"Square\\", still visits their father in prison but Sam continuously refused to as he had lingering fears that he would one day be like his father. As a result, the siblings drifted apart over the years, only communicating sporadically through text messaging. Jay is currently imprisoned at Milburn Penitentiary. He was present at Sam's wedding, albeit uninvited, but father and son call an uneasy truce and he tells Sam to \\"thank your lucky stars you didn't end up like me\\". =Oliver Shaw= :Portrayed by Matt Gordon Oliver Shaw is one of the rookies' training officers and a 20-year veteran (as of season 6) of the police force. He was introduced in the pilot as the training officer of Andy McNally, a fresh academy graduate and daughter of his own former training officer Tommy McNally. Shaw is the kind of cop who doesn’t go looking for trouble but doesn't shy away from it when it finds him. Despite being their superior, he takes care of the rookies and genuinely cares for them. He appears too laid back and is often seen eating a burger or sandwich in his car while on patrol waiting for a call but reveals that he did it so that his rookie would have the chance to take a breather and not rush into things. During off-hours he is usually seen hanging out with his colleagues, either Swarek or one of the rookies. He is close friends with Swarek, whom he calls \\"brother\\", and would serve as best man at Swarek and McNally's wedding. In season 1, Shaw is portrayed as one of the few older police officers with a functional marriage and family, having a wife and three daughters, but it goes down the drain when his wife finds out he visited a strip club and kicked him out of the house. He and his wife had been on and off before he realizes that she was in love with someone else. He then files for divorce and moves out. He is dating a witch named Celery, played by Emily Hampshire. In season 5, he is promoted to staff sergeant after Frank Best was removed in light of Swarek's shooting and because Ford managed to elude security and enter the premises with a weapon. internal affairs needed a scapegoat and Best stepped down as a result. A self-described \\"street cop\\", he has expressed discontent on numerous occasions with remaining behind the desk during a crisis.

Tireless and exceedingly charming, he sometimes butts heads with Swarek over the latter's penchant for bending the rules during investigations. He was involved in a relationship with McNally, despite Swarek warning her that Callaghan had a reputation for dating one rookie a year, until he cheated on her with his ex-girlfriend, Jo Rosati. McNally ends the relationship, but Luke wants her back, and the fallout causes Jo Rosati to leave 15 Division. He is heartbroken but eventually accepts that Andy doesn't want him back. This is particularly seen when he discovers that Andy and Sam had been seeing each other while Sam was undercover. He is gone half of the third season due to a task force mission. He comes back after Gail's kidnapping. At the end of the season, he asks Andy and Nick to participate in the task force with him. Despite his reputation as a charming \\"ladies' man\\", he is dedicated to his work.

Career On September 11, 1859, in Lowell, Ohio, she married Harrison Gray Otis, a printer's apprentice. He was a native of Ohio, but at the time, a temporary resident of Louisville, Kentucky, to which city Mr. and Mrs. Otis removed shortly after their marriage. In 1860, she thought about the approaching Civil War and upbraided herself for not being able to help. When the war broke out, the husband entered the Union Army as a private, served honorably throughout the war, participating in many engagements, was twice wounded in battle, received seven promotions, and was twice breveted for gallant and meritorious conduct, rising to the rank of lieutenant-colonel by brevet. After the war, they resided in Marietta, Ohio, the husband editing a small newspaper there, to which Mrs. Otis contributed. In 1867, they removed to Washington, D.C., where Col. Otis was in the civil service of the government, and both he and his wife kept up their interest in literary and journalistic pursuits. In 1876, they removed to Santa Barbara, California, where Col. Otis conducted the Santa Barbara Daily Press, and in 1882 they settled permanently in Los Angeles. In 1879, he accepted the position of United States Treasury Agent in charge of the Seal Islands of Alaska, which position he resigned in 1882. Mrs. Otis spent a year with her husband in Saint Paul Island, and then they returned to Santa Barbara. Having disposed of his interest in the Press, Col. Otis purchased a share in the Los Angeles Times. Eventually, he held the controlling interest, and served as its editor-in-chief. She was the co-founder and publisher of the Los Angeles Times. Col. Otis also held the position of president and general manager of the Times Mirror Company. Eliza Otis (1910) She was the author of the book Echoes from Elf-Land (Los Angeles, 1890), a volume of verse for children, which was published in 1890. The main body of her writings, however, was in the form of regular contributions, through many years, to the columns of the Los Angeles Times. Her special departments, among the most popular of the paper, were \\"Woman and Home\\" and \\"Our Boys and Girls.\\" While she preferred writing poems, as a prose-writer, she was fluent and graceful. The diversity of her writings ranged from nature, art and religion to patriotism, love, war, sociology, and juvenile topics. These were collected, compiled and edited by her husband in 1905, and published in one large volume under the title of California, Where Sets the Sun. The volume contains an appendix entitled \\"Memorial Chimes,\\" describing the bells erected by friends and admirers in Hollywood cemetery, in honor of his wife. Personal life Otis made her home in Los Angeles. She and her husband had five children. A son, Harrison Gray, born 1861, died in infancy. There were also four daughters. Emma Marian married Harry Chandler. Ida Mabel (1871-1955) married Franklin Booth (1861-1956), who were the grandparents of Franklin Otis Booth Jr.. Otis Chandler is a great-grandson. There was also Lilian (1864-1866), and Esther, born 1876, died in infancy. She took an active interest in many lines of good work done by associated women, including the Woman's Parliament of Southern California, the Ruskin Art Club, Friday Morning Club, California State Congress of Mothers, and the Landmarks Club, all of her own city. She was a devoted member of the First Congregational Church of Los Angeles. Otis died in her home, \\"The Bivouac\\", in Westlake Village, California, November 12, 1904. She was survived by her husband and three married daughters, one of whom died later. The Eliza A. Otis Memorial Chimes in Hollywood Forever Cemetery are named in her honor.

It is endemic to New Guinea and only known from the Huon Peninsula in the Morobe Province, Papua New Guinea. The specific name rainerguentheri honours , a German herpetologist from the Natural History Museum, Berlin. Common name Huon Mawatta frog has been proposed for this species. Description Adult males measure in snout–vent length; females are unknown. The body is robust and broader than the head. The snout is truncate and rounded in lateral profile and truncate in dorsal view. The tympanum is indistinct and the supra-tympanic fold is short. The fingers and toes are unwebbed but bear discs with distinct circum-marginal grooves. The dorsum is mostly brown but bears conspicuous, dark brown lumbar ocelli; some mottling may be present too. The flanks are flesh-toned and have small whitish flecks, sometimes also small brown spots and blotches. Some specimens have a faint, flesh-toned inter-orbital bar. The legs have cross-bars. The male advertisement call is a very long series of single-note calls, lasting up to two minutes. A single call lasts about 0.1 seconds. The dominant frequency is relatively low, about 1100 Hz. Habitat and conservation Hylophorbus rainerguentheri in habits extremely wet, lower- montane rainforests at elevations of above sea level. Males have been observed calling from the ground or from logs on the forest floor, or from more elevated positions (≤ above the ground), normally from inside dense clumps of moss on tree trunks or tree branches. Threats to this species are not known. The type locality is a reasonably well-protected Wildlife Management Area, thanks to efforts to protect tree-kangaroos.

Professional career Born in Munich, Gruber initially trained as an actor before making his opera debut in his native city in 1900. From 1901 to 1902, he worked at the Thalia-Theater in Saarbrücken. By that time, he had already begun studies as a singer, partly with his father. In 1902, he made his debut in the Stadttheater Regensburg and already in 1903, he was offered a position at the Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz in Munich, where he achieved success primarily as an operetta singer. Gruber continued his singing studies, and in 1915 he was engaged at the National Theatre Munich, where he made his debut as Manrico in Verdi's Il Trovatore. On 28 March 1916, he sang in the double-bill world premiere performances of Korngold's Violanta (in the role of Alfonso) and Der Ring des Polykrates (in the role of Florian). Further roles in this theater included Hoffmann in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann, Don José in Bizet's Carmen and Pedro in Albert's Tiefland. In 1918, he sang in the world premiere performance of Paul Graener's opera Theofano. In 1921, Gruber moved to the Landestheater Dessau, where he started singing Heldentenor roles like Lohengrin, Siegmund, Siegfried, and also the Emperor in Strauss' Die Frau ohne Schatten.

It is the first part of the Century Trilogy which follows five interrelated families throughout the course of the 20th century. The first book covers notable events such as World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the struggle for women's suffrage. The sequel Winter of the World covers World War II and was published on September 18, 2012. The third book, Edge of Eternity, covers the Cold War and was published in 2014. Plot summary The novel begins with the thirteen-year-old Billy Williams, nicknamed 'Billy With Jesus', going to work his first day in the coal mine underneath the fictional Welsh town of Aberowen in 1911. Three years later, the main story begins. Edward \\"Fitz\\" Fitzherbert, Earl Fitzherbert, who maintains a country estate in Aberowen and licenses the land on which the coal mine is built, hosts a party for many powerful people around the world. His guests include: * Lady Maud Fitzherbert, Fitz's sister, who is far more liberal than her conservative brother. * Walter von Ulrich, a German nobleman and a former schoolmate of Fitz's. He and Maud begin at the party to act on the mutual attraction they have felt for years. * Graf (Count) Robert von Ulrich, Walter's Austrian homosexual cousin. * Gus Dewar, a highly educated American who is also a close adviser to President Woodrow Wilson. * Bea Fitzherbert, Fitz's wife, a Russian Princess. * King George V, King of the British Empire. * Mary of Teck, wife of King George V. Major characters introduced after the party include Grigori and Lev Peshkov, two Russian orphans who work in a locomotive factory and have personal reasons to hold a grudge against Princess Bea and the rest of the Russian royal family. Grigori and Lev's father was executed by Bea's aristocratic family for alleged improper grazing of cattle on Bea's family's land. The overall theme of the novel revolves around common people trying, and many times succeeding, in throwing off the yokes so often placed on them by a society (largely focused on Britain and Russia) dominated by the landed aristocracy. There are several key themes in this novel. Follett has done a remarkable job in linking several key facets in world history at this point. They include the causes of the First World War, the collapse of the Russian Empire, and Germany's role in the continuance of a bloody war that led to its economic collapse and the postwar rise of Hitler. Regarding Russian history, he portrays Lenin's role in the rise of the Bolsheviks as a ploy of the German intelligence service as an attempt to divide and conquer Russian resistance on the Eastern Front. He does not clearly explain the rise of Stalin as Lenin died. This may be better explained in the second volume (he does this at about page 500 of Volume 2, which seems to understate the role of Stalin in Europe and US history). Throughout the novel, several chapters are devoted to the rise of women's rights in Britain and role of the Labour Party in promoting issues affecting worker safety following a mining accident in Wales. Through these chapters, he displays the considerable differences in social status of the miners and the owners of the mines in quality of life, health and education. With tragic accuracy, Follett reviews the misery and suffering of soldiers in the trenches of the Western Front, including, poison gas, futile charges against artillery and machine gun posts etc. as the war continues, thousands are slain and the so-called leaders continue to promote it as a victorious exercise. Follett focuses on how industrial interests on both sides benefited from the war, continuing it as factory production went up and the dead were brought back to England. The book explores the background of Germany at the time, the costs of their endless efforts to \\"win\\" leading to a loss that later was cause for a forlorn corporal, Adolf Hitler, to seek his own revenge for the economic devastation of Germany under the Treaty of Versailles. The characters and their extended families find their fortunes changing for the better and for the worse due to both their interactions with each other and the effects of the First World War. In the course of the book, virtually all female characters get pregnant - with or without being married - and give birth to one or two children. These will be teenagers in the 1930s and young adults during the Second World War, and will be the main characters of the series' second book. Critical reception The book received generally positive reviews, lauding the extensive historical research that has been intertwined into the narrative.

Beauregard High School was formed in 1923 as Whatley High School with the consolidation of several rural one-room schools in the area, including Whatley, Thompson, Hopewell, Hinson, Parker's Cross Road, and Dorsey Schools. By 1927, Whatley had absorbed Barron's Cross Road, Pleasant Grove, Sand Hill, Watoola, Pierce Chapel, and Marvyn Schools. This consolidated Whatley school served grades 1-11, with students wishing to finish high school attending Auburn High School seven miles northwest in Auburn. In 1927, Whatley school added the 12th grade and was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. A teacher at the school, Kate Grimmett Parker, requested in 1928 that the school's name be changed to \\"Beauregard High School\\", after Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard. This name change was accepted, and the school quickly adopted the mascot of the hornet, after the \\"Hornet's Nest\\", a particularly vicious area of fighting of General Beauregard's troops in the Battle of Shiloh.Virginia Whatley, \\"Beauregard Community\\", Lee County and Her Forebears, (Montgomery, Ala.: Herff Jones, 1983), 110-111. Until 1936, electricity at Beauregard High was supplied by a Delco-Light gas generator, and indoor plumbing was added in 1939. During the 1970-71 school year, Beauregard integrated with nearby Sanford High School, which led to the school being reconfigured from grades 1-12 to grades 1-3 and 10-12, with grades 4 and 9 added back to the school in subsequent years. By 1992, the secondary and elementary divisions were split, and today both Beauregard High School and Beauregard Elementary School share the same campus as separate schools.

He graduated from Hamilton College, in Clinton, New York, in 1941. He enrolled in the University of Chicago Law School in the fall of 1941, but withdrew to enlist in the Navy early in 1942. After pilot training he served with distinction in the Pacific, rising in rank to lieutenant commander, commanding a squadron of aircraft, and earning two Distinguished Flying Crosses and other medals for valor.Airline Executives and Federal Regulation: Case Studies in American Enterprise from the Airmail Era to the Dawn of the Jet Age In 1945 Peach resumed law studies at Cornell University, and took a part-time pilot position with fledgling Robinson Airlines, then operating two Fairchild F-24s and two Cessna T-50s in scheduled air taxi service between Ithaca and New York. Within a few years Peach was executive vice president and general manager, Robinson had grown in route structure, acquired DC-3 aircraft to handle the increasing passenger load, and changed its name to Mohawk Airlines.Robert E Peach and Mohawk Airlines: A Study in Entrepreneurship Peach anticipated and drove the expansion of Mohawk, wrestling with the Civil Aeronautics Board, expanding routes, relocating to the Oneida County Airport near Utica, and hiring a consultant in 1953 to evaluate the need for newer, more capable aircraft, a search for which ultimately led to securing three Convair 240 aircraft via Claire Lee Chennault. He continued to drive and expand Mohawk, acquiring new routes and new aircraft, and by the early 1960s Mohawk, having begun as Robinson Airlines with a single four-seat Fairchild F-24, operated a fleet of five Convair 440s, fourteen Martin 404s acquired from Eastern Airlines when Peach took over the Colonial Airlines routes Eastern had acquired in 1956, fourteen Convair 240s, and four DC-3s.Airline Executives and Federal Regulation: Case Studies in American Enterprise from the Airmail Era to the Dawn of the Jet Age Early in the 1960s Peach advanced toward the acquisition of BAC-111 and FH-227 aircraft to serve Mohawk's routes, as well as corporate, headquarters, maintenance, and training expansions, all of which entailed the necessity of taking on considerable corporate debt for expansion. By 1966 Mohawk had 432 million passenger-miles, reduced federal subsidies from the CAB, and an operating profit of $10.6 million. Peach had led Mohawk to a leadership role amongst regional airlines, and his accomplishment was recognized – in 1964 he was invited to address the Newcomen Society in North America on the history of Mohawk, and in 1965 Syracuse University awarded him the prestigious Salzberg Memorial Medal.Robert E Peach and Mohawk Airlines: A Study in Entrepreneurship In 1968, however, an economic and financial perfect storm began to form for Mohawk and Peach: On 3 July 1968 PATCO, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers union went on a 'by- the-rule-book' slow-down strike which threw air traffic in the northeast into chaos for months, thus reducing passenger traffic while at the same time sharply increasing Mohawk's costs for fuel, labor, and overtime, and which further combined with a general economic slowdown and airline traffic slowdown for all carriers precisely at the point at which Mohawk was vulnerable from having leveraged to finance expansion and the purchase of new equipment. Financing burdens were now increasing as a percentage of operations, and Peach was eased to the side as the financial storm continued to grow. By 1970 the national economy was in a full-blown recession and the situation at Mohawk, with Peach on the sidelines, was becoming desperate, at which point, feeling threatened by the shifting of less-travelled routes to commuter airlines, Mohawk's pilots began a long and ultimately destructive strike, demanding the right to veto the shifting of routes, which management refused. Within weeks Mohawk was forced to inform creditors it was unable to meet payments, and efforts to restructure financial arrangements began. The pilots' dispute was finally settled after 154 days, with Mohawk facing losses announced 19 March 1971 of a staggering $11.9 million. Management, which had forced Peach to the sidelines, announced a merger with Allegheny Airlines.Airline Executives and Federal Regulation: Case Studies in American Enterprise from the Airmail Era to the Dawn of the Jet Age On 20 April 1971 Robert Peach was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, at his home in Clinton, New York, aged fifty- one.Robert E Peach and Mohawk Airlines: A Study in Entrepreneurship References Sources * Airline Executives and Federal Regulation: Case Studies in American Enterprise from the Airmail Era to the Dawn of the Jet Age, W David Lewis, ed. 2000, Ohio State University Press. .

He became well known for the general public thanks to his participation in ZDF-Magazin.  Family  Schenk was born into a politically active and traditionally social democratic family in Helbra. A number of his family members were persecuted by Nazis in the Third Reich. His father was a hydraulic engineer and worked for years managing a waterworks in Harz region, German Democratic Republic. When Fritz Schenk later escaped to the Federal Republic of Germany, his father was dismissed from the job and died of heart infarction on 10 November 1962 after an interrogation by the Stasi. Schenk later accused Communists throughout all of his life of having killed his father, whereas Nazis had just treated him in an unhuman mannerFritz Schenk: Letter to Angela Merkel of 12 November 2003, printed in: Schenk, Der Fall Hohmann, 2005, S. 110. Since 1951, Fritz Schenk was married to Rosemarie (maiden name Müller). They had three sons.  Positions in the GDR  Schenk joined the German Social Democratic Party after World War II. When the party was forcibly unified with the Communist Party of Germany, he became a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). Schenk had learnt to become a print worker and worked in the graphics industry. He later graduated from the East German College of Economics. He eventually worked as head of a printing house in Meißen. Since 1952 he worked for the State Planning Commission of the GDR, becoming later that year a personal assistant of its new chief Bruno Leuschner, who became in the following year also a candidate member of the Politburo and the GDR's most influential politician on economic affairs. Schenk also met SED chief Walter Ulbricht. In 1957, the Stasi began to suspect him of espionage and arrested him. Having signed a declaration of co-operation with the state security bodies, he was released. He fled immediately through West Berlin (1957), whence he moved to West Germany with the assistance of the Eastern Office of the Social Democratic Party, an institution maintaining contacts with the dissidents and fugitives from East Germany .  Career as a journalist  In West, Fritz Schenk initially worked as a freelance journalist and author. In 1960 he re-joined the Social Democratic Party. He abstained from standing as a candidate to the parliament, after he had initially considered this option. He worked for a number of institutes that dealt with East–West issues, incl. a possible German reunification. In 1972 he resigned from the SPD due to his criticism of the Ostpolitik of Willy Brandt. Since 1971, Fritz Schenk worked for the ZDF. He was the deputy of the presenter Gerhard Löwenthal of the popular „ZDF-Magazin“, that during the 1970s and 1980s raised controversy due to Conservative coverage of political events. In 1974/75, Schenk was a member of the conservative Bund Freies Deutschland.Fritz Schenk in Munzinger Online, 27. April 2006 (liable to charge) He was the Press spokesman of that organization.Jochen Maes: Bund Freies Deutschland. Sammelbecken einer neuen Rechtspartei. Peter Hammer Verlag, Wuppertal o.J.

The broadcast, however, was replaced in April 1988 with the new broadcast „Studio 1“. At the same time, Fritz Schenk became managing editor of the ZDF editorial board. He retired in early 1990s, but continued with journalistic activities, publishing numerous articles and opinion pieces in newspapers and magazines. He was often asked to hold lectures or presentations due to his experiences gathered from his career in the former German Democratic Republic. He was since December 2004 a regular contributor and columnist to the conservative weekly Junge Freiheit. In the column „Die Woche“ ('The Week'), Fritz Schenk commented on the actual political events in Germany.  Critical solidarity with Martin Hohmann  He attracted public attention with his activities connected with the Martin Hohmann affair. When a scandal erupted in October 2003, as some regarded his speech as antisemitic, a proceeding was started over expelling Hohmann from the Christian Democratic Union. Schenk, who had been a member of the CDU since 1999, accompanied with his supporters, started the initiative „Critical Solidarity with Martin Hohmann“. The signatories of their appeal explained, that they regarded Homann's speech as controversial and in some parts questionable, but not as antisemitic. Hence they supported his continuing membership in the CDU and its parliamentary party. All in all, 10,200 people signed the appeal. On 22 July 2005 Schenk resigned from his positions within the initiative, as Martin Hohmann had declared that he would take part in the 2005 parliamentary election as an independent. Thus, Schenk saw this declaration as Homann's decision to withdraw from the Christian Democratic Party.Pressemitteilung von Fritz Schenk am 22. Juli 2005, 27.

Waldron was an American writer and journalist whose primary work consisted of short stories, essays, and poetry. His writings were published in literary journals (such as The Kenyon Review, Prairie Schooner, and Story) and popular periodicals (such as Collier's, Holiday, Rolling Stone, Saturday Evening Post). From the 1950s to 1970s he contributed stories and essays to The New Yorker, and in the 1960s and 1970s, a number of his poems and experimental fiction works appeared in underground, alternative, and \\"counter-culture\\" publications, such as The Illustrated Paper, Rat Subterranean News, Underground, The Village Voice, and The Woodstock Times. Much of Waldron's fiction and non-fiction reveals a strong interest in the \\"underdog\\" and the marginalized, disenfranchised individual, as well as a belief in the possibility of triumph over (often seemingly great) adversity. Making repeated use of satire and often introducing surprise endings, Waldron consistently questioned what he perceived to be the status quo and championed those who may have been viewed as \\"outsiders\\" by people in authority or by members of society's \\"mainstream.\\" This outlook and approach may be seen vividly in such fiction pieces as \\"The Beekeeper\\" (published in Prairie Schooner in 1943) and \\"Zawicki the Chicken\\" (Cross Section 1945: A Collection of New American Writing), as well as in such non-fiction portraits as \\"The Death of Hank Williams\\" (The Reporter, 1955) and \\"The Lonely Lady of Union Square\\" (The New Yorker, 1955). Despite his literary achievement, he did not see a book published in his lifetime, nor has one appeared since. Nonetheless, his work continues to gain attention and recognition. In 2013, The Kenyon Review, published his story \\"Do Birds Like Television?\\" along with six of his drawings featuring birds. His story, \\"The Death of Hank Williams\\" (1955) was included in excerpted form in The Hank Williams Reader issued by Oxford University Press in 2014. Biography Waldron was born in 1916 in Oconto Falls, Wisc. where he grew up. He was the youngest of his parents Rose Cleveland and Jonathan Witcher Waldron's seven children. His mother was an amateur poet, and his brother Jonathan Gilbert Waldron (1910–1974) was an advertising manager and writer, whose short stories and articles were published in popular periodicals during the 1950s.\\"In Memoriam J.G. 'Gib' Waldron.\\" Memco News. Appleton, Wisc.: Miller Electric Mfg. Co., circa 1974. Waldron's first literary efforts in the early 1940s resulted in some critical praise. Author Katherine Anne Porter, for example, remarked, in 1943, that Waldron possessed \\"the spark\\" and that his work was able to reveal the \\"deeper stratum of human suffering.\\"Bayley, Isabel, selector and editor. Letters of Katherine Anne Porter. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1980. He attracted the attention of future literary agent, Donald Congdon in New York, who began representing him in 1943 on behalf of Lurton Blassingame's literary agency, and soon he was considered one of the most promising young writers in the United States. In 1945, he received a literary prize, the \\"Participation Award,\\" from the publishing firm, Simon & Schuster for the completion of a novel.Hutchens, John K. \\"People Who Read and Write,\\" New York Times, \\"Book Review,\\" March 17, 1946, p. BR13. His resulting novella, \\"The Low Dark Road\\" received strong responses of praise as well as criticism from the firm's editors, and ultimately was not published. He did not rise to the same heights of fame as such contemporaries as James Baldwin, J. D. Salinger, and Herman Wouk. Waldron moved to Charlton Street in New York City in 1947 and became part of a literary circle that included Hollis Alpert, Josephine Herbst, S. J. Perelman, and J. D. Salinger. Following the publication in July 1951, of his review of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye,Waldron, Eli. \\"'The Catcher in the Rye': J. D. Salinger's Novel of a Lonely, Confused Boy of 16 Has Qualities of Lardner and Twain.\\" \\"Milwaukee Journal,\\" \\"Books of the Week,\\" July 15, 1951, p.4. Salinger wrote his reviewer a warm note of thanks, adding: \\"I hope one day somebody writes with that much perception and feeling about a book of yours.\\"Salinger, Jerry. Letter to Eli Waldron. July 30, 1951. Eli Waldron Papers, New York. Waldron continued publishing short stories in Collier's through the early 1950s. He went on to develop his career as a magazine journalist, publishing articles and stories in Holiday, Rolling Stone, Saturday Evening Post, and The New Yorker. His last piece for a major periodical, a profile of the artist Saul Steinberg, appeared in Publishers Weekly on May 7, 1973. Despite what writers such as Howard Mitcham,Mitcham, Howard. \\"Hot Flashbacks and Cool Cookies: Reminiscences of Greenwich Village in the 40s and 50s,\\" Pulpsmith, v. 5 (1985), p. 137–146. and Richard Gehman, describe as bouts of writer's block, depression, and alcoholism, he wrote and published until his death in 1980, producing masterful works of literary fiction, striking journalism, irreverent travelogues, satirical flights of fancy, lively verse and even lyrics, as well as drawings. In his 1967 Chicago Tribune article, entitled, \\"Eli Waldron, Where Are You Now?,\\" Gehman remarked that the suddenly difficult to locate Waldron, who had been part of Gehman's own Greenwich Village literary circle in the 1940s and 1950s, was \\"one of the best, and perhaps least appreciated, writers of my time.\\"Gehman, Richard. \\"Eli Waldron, Where are You Now?,\\" Chicago Tribune, \\"Books Today,\\" Sunday, July 2, 1967, p. 3. Longtime New Yorker editor, William Shawn, echoed these words in a eulogy for Waldron on November 15, 1980, stating, \\"What [Waldron] wrote gleamed, and gleams brighter with the passage of time.\\"Shawn, William. Eulogy for Eli Waldron. Read at St. Marks Church-In-The-Bowery, November 15, 1980. Shawn also stated, quite simply, that Waldron was \\"an original, an innovator,\\" and \\"a writer of immense talent who wrote far too little, perhaps because the standards he set for himself were so high that even he could rarely reach them.\\" Marriage and family Waldron was married four times. His third marriage to painter Phyllis Floyd in 1960 produced two daughters, Zoe and Eve. Death Waldron died in a car crash on Monday, June 9, 1980, on Route 15 in Gordonsville, Virginia, while visiting novelist Christian Gehman, the son of Richard Gehman. He was 64 and had been living in Woodstock, N.Y. since 1974 with his wife Marie Waldron. Drawings Fast Nichts February 5, 1975. Eli Waldron's drawings, dating from the 1950s to 1980, were less known than his literary work, with only one published during his lifetime. Nonetheless, they represent an important part of his oeuvre. In these drawings, words and images coalesce to create a literary form of art. Many are captioned and deal with the themes of love, sex, nature, the individual, politics, power, religion, spirituality, and the cosmos with concision, wit, and humor. Motifs include trees, birds, eyes, faces, and signs. A recurrent feature in the drawings is the profile of a long-nosed man, who could be said to represent the artist, observing. The body of the works include single drawings, groups of related drawings, collections, such as \\"Varieties of Religious Experience,\\" (undated), and illustrated books, such as \\"Presto,\\" 1973, that combine drawings with prose or poetry. Some works, such as the collection \\"Ipglok,\\" ca. 1973, are \\"word art,\\" in which words themselves, in unusual spellings and arrangements, are the subject of the work. Most are in a linear style, favored by Saul Steinberg and Picasso, and are executed in Rapidograph or Flair felt tip pens in drawing pads, 12 x 18 in., 8 1/2 x 11 in. or smaller sheets of paper. He also made paintings on 12 x 16 in. canvas panels. Some of Waldron's correspondence includes his drawings.

It is less of a strict set of functions and tags, but more a standard for providing developers of web-based mobility applications a means to configure, control and retrieve information from additional input devices and features of rugged mobile computers.  History  = EMML 1.0 = EMML was first devised by James Morley-Smith in 2001, when working as a Software Developer at Symbol Technologies (now a wholly owned subsidiary of Motorola, Inc). As part of the first version of Symbol’s PocketBrowser, EMML was originally a mechanism for providing access to the barcode scanner built into many of Symbol's enterprise mobility devices. It was extended to include features such as WLAN signal indicators, power statistics and access to the communications port to allow for input from custom devices such as magnetic card readers and temperature probes. EMML 1.0 support is currently offered by commercial browsers and development tools from companies such as Naurtech, Intermec, Wavelink, and Georgia Softworks Documentation: Georgia SoftWorks GSWBrowse for Windows RF Devices Retrieved 2011-07-08 . = EMML 1.1 = In 2009 Motorola created an updated version of EMML in order to co-ordinate it with other Internet standards, most notably CSS. There was a clear focus on simplifying the standard and reducing the amount of redundant code. In doing so, the number of bytes required to be downloaded was reduced and the readability of the language was vastly improved. Previously, all parameters had to be supplied to each META function individually. This meant that each module might have several META tags, each taking up several bytes worth of data. In EMML 1.1, parameters can be supplied in a semi-colon delimited list, much like styles in a CSS style block in HTML.  Characteristics  = Usage of The META Tag = EMML utilizes the META tag from the HTML language to set properties and specify callback functions by which the browser returns information. According to the W3C the META Tag is: \\"an extensible container for use in identifying specialized document meta-information\\".W3C Hypertext Markup Language - 2.0 In EMML, the \`http-equiv\` parameter is primarily used to identify the module of functionality. The \`content\` parameter is used to set properties, methods, and associated events.  Actions  There are three main actions in the EMML language: # Setting property values # Invoking methods # Retrieving information through events = Setting Property Values = In EMML, setting properties is a case of providing the module and property to set, followed by the value.  In EMML 1.0  Example 1. The following is an example of setting the x-position in pixels of the on screen battery indicator in EMML 1.0: Example 2. This is an example of several parameters being applied to the battery module using EMML 1.0:  In EMML 1.1 The example shown in Example 2. in In EMML 1.0 can be written this way in EMML 1.1: It is immediately apparent in the example from EMML 1.1 that there is less redundant information. It may also be observed that the \`x\` and \`y\` parameters from EMML 1.0 have been substituted for the \`left\` and \`top\` parameters familiar to CSS. This is also true for the \`w\` and \`h\` EMML 1.0 parameters that have become \`width\` and \`height\` in EMML 1.1. The way in which color is described was also changed to the \`#rrggbb\` format of HTML and CSS. = Invoking Methods = Methods are written in a way similar to setting a property. Again, the module appears in the \`http-equiv\` parameter, and the action in the \`content\` parameter.  In EMML 1.0  The following would cause the on screen battery indicator to be displayed:  In EMML 1.1  The \`show\` method from EMML 1.0 was dropped in favor of the \`visibility\` parameter with the \`visible\` value, similarly \`hide\` is now the \`hidden\` value of the \`visibility\` parameter. = Retrieving Information Through Events = Retrieving information is carried out by specifying a callback function to which the EMML browser returns information. Typically, META functions which return information were named as the module name followed by the word \\"navigate\\". The callback function could be a URL, where the data is passed as named-value pairs in the query string, or a JavaScript function or variable.  In EMML 1.0  The following is how you would set all of these for the \`batterynavigate\` function in EMML 1.0 Note: all of these methods would not be included in one document, they are included here as an example. In EMML 1.0, you specify a place holder for each value you are interested in using a \`%s\`. This has the drawback of requiring the developer to supply a placeholder for inconsequential values. For example, placeholders would be required for 8 values, even if only the 1st and 8th values were of interest.  In EMML 1.1  In EMML 1.1 events have a parameter value for each event and each module can therefore support more than one event. Or In EMML 1.1, the \`s\` can be substituted for a numerical value representing the position of the value of interest. Therefore, if requesting the 1st and 8th values from the \`signalevent\` of the \`signal\` module, the tag might be written as follows:  EMML Profiles (EMMP)  Also added in EMML 1.1 were EMML Profiles. EMML Profiles are similar to CSS style sheets. An EMML Profile allows for the creation of EMML classes--a common set of EMML META tags which can be applied to a page or element. Below is an example of an EMML Profile Page: .inventoryBarcodes { scanner-alldecoders: disabled; scanner-code128redundancy: true; scanner-code128minlength: 10; scanner-code128maxlength: 16; scanner- code128: enabled; scanner-ean13: enabled; scanner-i2of5: enabled; } .inventoryBattery { battery-left: 10; battery-top: 0; battery-visibility: visible; } EMML Profiles are stored in \`.emmp\` files; these can be linked to the HTML document using the \`import\` method of the \`EMMLProfile\` module. This is an example of how an EMMP file would be linked: Note: Each META tag is parsed from left to right applying each component part in turn. Therefore, in the above example, the \`source\` parameter will be set before the \`import\` method is called. The same is true for EMML Profiles which are applied from top downwards. When a profile page is linked, the class name can simply be referenced, and with that, all the parameters in the profile can be applied with one command. As can be seen from the example above, it is possible to set any number of profiles. When doing this, however, one should be aware of conflicting parameters.

The Eva Klabin House Museum (in Portuguese, Casa Museu Eva Klabin) is an historic house museum located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It is a private institution established in 1990 by the Brazilian collector and philanthropist (1903–1991), with the purpose of preserving and displaying the art collection gathered together during her life. The collection is open to the public in the house where Klabin lived for over thirty years. It is considered one of the largest classical art collections in Brazilian museums, with over 2000 works spanning almost 5000 years, from Ancient Egypt to Impressionism. History =Eva Klabin= Eva Klabin in 1929. Eva Klabin, born in São Paulo in 1903, was the eldest daughter of the Lithuanian immigrants Fanny and Hessel Klabin. Her father was one of the founders of Klabin, one of the leading paper industries of the country. In her teenage years, she lived in Germany with her family. After the World War I erupted, they were forced to move to Switzerland, where Eva attended a school in Neuchâtel. The family returned to Brazil in 1919, but Eva went back to Germany in 1922, escorting her mother, who underwent treatments for her health. Three years after her mother's death in 1926, Eva embarked to the United States to complete her studies. There, she attended the New York School of Secretaries and did voice over for a Paramount movie called Anybody's Woman. After returning to São Paulo, she married, in 1933, the Austrian-born Brazilian lawyer and journalist Paulo Rapaport and moved with him to Rio de Janeiro. In 1952, they bought the house where both would live for the rest of their lives, one of the first houses built around the newly urbanized Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon. There, Eva started collecting artworks, sometimes relying on her husband support to acquire some objects. After Paulo's death in 1957, Eva wouldn't marry again. Childless, she devoted herself almost exclusively to the habit of collecting, making frequent travels to Europe to acquire new items. In the 1960s, with the growing of the collection, Eva decided to renovate and expand her house, while maintaining its original style. She would later become a prominent figure of Brazilian cultural and political life, as also a leading hostess in Rio de Janeiro, offering gala dinners to important guests, such as Harry Oppenheimer, Juscelino Kubitschek, David Rockefeller, Elie Wiesel, Henry Kissinger and Shimon Peres. After the fire which destroyed 70% of the collection of the Rio de Janeiro Museum of Modern Art in 1978, shocking the Brazilian artistic community, Eva started worrying about the future of her collection. She decided to hire experts to draw up an inventory of her holdings and conduct researches on individual itens. Following the steps of her sister, Ema Gordon Klabin, who had established the Ema Gordon Klabin Cultural Foundation in the same year that the fire happened, Eva started taking the legal measures required to establish her own foundation. Eva died in 1991, one year after the foundation was established. =Foundation= Idealized in the 1970s and legally in established in 1990, the Eva Klabin Foundation was officially open for public visitation by Francisco Weffort, Brazil's Minister of Culture at that time, on August 22, 1995. Besides preserving and displaying the collection, the foundation has also the mission of organizing cultural, artistic, historical and scientific activities, such as temporary exhibitions, concerts, courses and conferences. It also has an editorial department devoted to publishing works on the collection. The institution falls into the typology of \\"house-museum\\", where artworks are permanently arranged throughout the rooms according to Eva's wish and taste. The Breathing Project was created in 2004 by Marcio Doctors, who has curated it ever since. Its aim is to foster interaction between contemporary art interventions and the classical art collection at Fundação Eva Klabin. Doctors invites contemporary artists to intervene in the exhibition spaces at the house museum, creating a bridge between the established art from the past and contemporary manifestations. Ernesto Neto, Nuno Ramos, Anna Bella Geiger, Claudia Bakker and José Damasceno are just a few of the guest artists. =House= The house is located on the banks of the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, in the South Zone of Rio de Janeiro. It was built in 1931, in Norman style, which was very much in fashion at the time. In 1952, the Roman architect Gaetano Minnucci was commissioned by Eva and her husband to renovate the house, which gained palatial facades and interiors in classic spirit. The house was expanded in the 1960s to accommodate the growing collection. The items are arranged throughout nine main rooms, which were named by Eva: Main Hall, Renaissance Room, English Room, Dining Room, Chinese Room, Upper Hall, Green Room, Boudoir and Bedroom. The yard was projected by Brazilian landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx and is very representative of his taste for bright colors and appreciation of tropical plant life. The collection The Eva Klabin Foundation collection is one of the most important classic art collections in Brazilian museums. It comprises over 2000 itens from Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, spanning a time-frame of almost 5000 years. The collection features paintings, sculptures, antiquities, furniture, oriental rugs, silverware and decorative objets d’art. =Egyptian collection= The Egyptian collection consists of about fifty items, including some objects which stand out in the context of Brazilian museums, due to their quality and rarity. Since these objects are not related to official archeological excavations, their exact place of origin remains largely unknown. The collection includes a number of large pharaonic statuary, in which a head of a Pharaoh in a nemes headdress is the centerpiece. Among the funerary itens, there is a coffin mask with encrusted glass eyes dating back to the 17th Dynasty, and other pieces which reflect the importance of animals in Egyptian rituals, such as a coffin of a mummified cat from the Ptolemaic period. The collection also includes reliefs and fragments of architectural decoration, such as a prominent temple bas-relief of a goddess with the body of a woman and the head of a lioness, dating back to the 3rd Intermediate Period. =Greco-Roman collection= Among the highlights of the Greco-Roman collection is a marble head of Apollo, fragment of a larger statue coming from Magna Graecia and dating back to 3rd-1st century BC, and a woman’s torso in pentelic marble, from the classic Athenian period. The collection also includes an important group of 24 Tanagras (terracotta figurines) dating back to the 4th century BC, and an assemblage of 58 ancient glass flasks and small vases provenient from the Mediterranean Basin, under the rule of the Roman Empire. It also comprises red and black pottery vases, an Attic krater from the Classic Period and two Italiote vases from Apulia and Magna Graecia. Jacopo Tintoretto - Portrait of Nicolaus Padavinus (1589). Camille Pissarro - Snow effects in Eragny (1895) =Italian collection= The Italian collection is noted for its emphasis in the Renaissance art. Outstanding among the paintings are the panels by Piermatteo Lauro de' Manfredi da Amelia and Sano di Pietro. There are several examples of Madonnas by Sienese, Florentine and Lombardian schools, including works attributed to Sandro Botticelli, Andrea del Sarto and Antoniazzo Romano. The large Portrait of Nicolaus Padavinus by Jacopo Tintoretto is the most important canvas in the collection. There are also works by Bernardo Strozzi, Guercino and Giovanni Francesco Romanelli, epitomizing the Baroque. The Florentine school outstands among the sculptures: a Madonna by Benedetto da Maiano, with a glazed ceramic frame by Andrea della Robbia, a pair of angels by Luca della Robbia, Madonna with Swaddled Child by Donatello, another Madonna by the workshop of Lorenzo Ghiberti are the main highlights, along with Mars, a bronze sculpture attributed to Giambologna. The collection also includes decorative objects, majolica plates and several examples of Renaissance furniture. =French collection= The French collection is composed by paintings, sculptures, drawings and decorative objects ranging from Middle Ages to the beginning of the 20th century. Outstanding among the paintings are a portrait attributed to François Clouet, a mythological scene by Louis Silvestre, two small landscapes by Nicolas- Antoine Taunay, a winter landscape by Camille Pissarro and head of a woman by Marie Laurencin. From the Rococo style, there's a drawing by Honoré Fragonard, entitled Le Petit Gourmand. Among the sculptures, the museum holds a very nice example of medieval stone statuary, Head a Noblewoman. The Renaissance French statuary is represented by a number of wooden carvings by anonymous masters. Two small terracotta fauns attributed to Clodion represents the Rococo trend. The collection of decorative arts includes late Gothic furniture, an assemblage of enameled Limoges plaques by Léonard Limosin, porcelain objets, Sèvres and Limoges dinner sets, Baccarat crystal, etc. Jan Provost - Madonna and Child with two angels (16th century). Joshua Reynolds - Study for the portrait of Lady Caroline, 18th century. =Flemish and Dutch collection= The museum holds a small group of Early Netherlandish paintings, including works by Adriaen Isenbrandt (Madonna and Child in a landscape), Jan Provost (Madonna and Child with two angels) and a Madonna attributed to Mabuse.

The species is only known from the Amoman Mountain, its type locality, after which it is also named. Common name Amoman choerophryne has been suggested for it. Description Adult males measure in snout–urostyle length; females are unknown. The snout is comparatively short (18–21% of the body length) and pointed. The eyes are relatively large. The tympanum is small. All fingers and toes bear discs. The overall ground colour is yellowish, greyish, or brownish, with brown, reddish or black markings and reticulations. Most specimens have an hour-glass marking on the dorsum, and many have a broad, light-coloured dorso-lateral stripe. The male advertisement call consists of two, sometimes only one, long and rasping notes. The notes have two phases; first with low and then with high pulse repetition rate. The dominant frequency in some calls is at 4.1 kHz, while others have two dominant frequencies (at 3.5 and 4.4 kHz). Habitat and ecology At the type locality, Choerophryne amomani inhabits primary and secondary rain forest at elevations of above sea level. It was found to be locally common. Males call from on or in leaf litter, rarely slightly higher (to 0.3 m above the ground) in hollow plant stems.

Its original performing home opened in 1903. This was rebuilt in 1955 and again in 1983. It now can hold over 700 spectators. Since 2002, Christian Stückl has served as the company’s Intendant. A new larger building has started being constructed in Zenetti platz in the former Viehhof on the corner of Tumblinger and Zenettistraße and it is scheduled to open in 2021. Old building In 1903, the architects Gerstenecker and Tittrich in the Josephspitalstraße in the district Altstadt-Lehel, designed and built a reinforced concrete constructed building. It opened with Schiller's Kabale und Liebe (Intrigue and Love). It had about 1000 seats. Then actress Elise Aulinger received her first theatre engagement here. The first performance took place on 10 November 1903. The manager initially was actor Ernst Schrumpf. Administratively, Wilhelm Braun assisted him. A report in the Munich Ratsch-Kathl from November 16, 1904, it can be seen that the theater had already gained recognition in Germany a year later. At this time, the 54th play was played at the house.Die Direktoren des Münchner Volkstheaters u. Münchner Volkstheater; in: Münchener Ratsch-Kathl Nr. 92, 16. November 1904, S. 1–2. Since 1907, the actor Rolf Pinegger was engaged, who remained loyal to the Volkstheater throughout his life. After the First World War, (actor and playwright) Ernst Bach was director of the theater. On 25 December 1921, the theatre hosted a performance of Bach and Franz Arnold's farce Der keusche Lebemann (or \\"The chaste bon vivant\\"). In 1932, Ludwig Schmid-Wildy became the head of the theater, which was still privately run at that time.Werner Ebnet From 1934 to 1938, Ferdinand Dörfler worked here as an actor, tenant and director.Werner Ebnet From 1933 to 1941, Willy Rösner belonged to the ensemble of the Volkstheater.Werner Ebnet It was then destroyed by bombs during World War II. Rebuilding 1983  thumb The theater was rebuilt in Brienner Straße in 1955, originally as a multi-purpose hall in the 'Haus der Sports'. It was then rebuilt in 1983 as the current Volkstheater and now can hold 609 spectators. Much of the cost of 3.9 million marks was borne by public donations in addition to urban support. At the opening, on 24 November 1983, Ruth Drexel staged the play 'Glaube und Heimat' (\\"Belief and home\\", 1910) by Karl Schönherr. The first director was Jörg-Dieter Haas from 1983 to 1988. The ensemble consisted of a group of well-known folk actors (eg Gustl Bayrhammer, Beppo Brem, Helmut Fischer, Willy Harlander, Karl Obermayr, Enzi Fuchs, Rita Russek, Maria Singer, Peter Thom and Michael Lerchenberg). In 1989, the \\"Nachtkastl\\", a variable platform pedestal with 120 seats, was added as a further venue. From 1988 to 2002, Ruth Drexel ran the house, interrupted by a short interim period by Hanns Christian Müller from 1998 to 1999. The program included especially the classics of South German-Austrian dialect literature, as well as works by the non-German Volkstheater tradition, but also pieces by Goethe (\\"Faust\\"), Schiller, Shakespeare (\\"Romeo and Juliet\\" and \\"Midsummer Night's Dream\\"), Molière, Brecht and others. In 2002, Christian Stückl became artistic director, who became known mainly through his productions of the Oberammergau Passion Play in 1990 and 2000. With a young ensemble and up-and- coming directors, the Volkstheater was able to gain a new profile within the theater scene and at times achieved almost 90 percent seat occupancy. Since 2005, 'Radikal jung' - The Festival of Young Directors takes place once a year. Since 2006, the Munich Volkstheater publishes the magazine \\"Volksmund\\" once a year instead of a season magazine. The 2007/08 issue was described as a \\"ravishingly funny\\" (by tz ) and a new discovery with a \\"feuilletonist claim\\" (Münchner Merkur). In 2013, The Kurt Wilhelm's play \\"Brandner Kaspar and Eternal Life\\" had its 250th performance with 170,000 visitors. It had its premiere on 30 March 2005 at the Volkstheater. Then by 2019, it had 300 sold- out houses, with an ensemble cast (in 2019) of Maximilian Brückner, Markus Brandl, Susanne Brückner, Ursula Maria Burkhart, Tobias van Dieken, Alexander Duda, Peter Mitterrutzner, Stefan Murr, Hubert Schmid, Hans Schuler, Kathrin von Steinburg and Young Riederinger musicians. New construction In December 2017, the winning design for a new building was presented on a total of almost 18,000 square meters in Zenetti platz in 'Viehhof' (a former Slaughterhouse). Which is about 2000m south of the 1983 theatre, it will have a hall with 600 seats and a workroom stage, as well as a rehearsal stage. The urban jury chose the design planning office space to the company Georg Reisch from Bad Saulgau, created by the Stuttgart based architects Lederer Ragnarsdóttir Oei to an all-inclusive price of just under 131 million euros.

The site of the accident is now beneath the surface of the Tranque Puclaro, a reservoir created in 1999. Accident The train was transporting schoolchildren on a day trip from La Serena to Vicuña to visit the Gabriela Mistral museum. The journey to Vicuna had proceeded without incident. After lunch the diesel locomotive ran around the train for the return trip as the children took their places in the five-car train. The train crew were in the stationmaster's office, finalising details of the return trip when the train started to move off. Those aboard the train thought nothing was amiss but there was no-one manning the locomotive. When the rail staff realised what was happening they unsuccessfully attempted to board the train in motion but being on a slope it quickly accelerated away from the station. Eight miles down the line at Cuesta de Gualliguaica the line makes a sharp bend next to the Elqui River. At this point the train derailed plunging into the ravine. President Salvador Allende was flown to the scene of the tragedy in an Air Force plane and demanded that those responsible for the accident be punished. Causes The enquiry into the accident observed that ideally all stations should be built such that no gradient exists on the lines passing through them; but the mountainous terrain in the area had made this impossible in the case of Vicuña. It also stated that the brakes on the train were of the Westinghouse design so should be fail-safe although the locomotive had been running at idle at the time and a fault in the system may have gone unnoticed. The report also highlighted that against the regulations it had become common practice not to keep the brakes applied when trains were waiting for long periods at the station. Press reports at the time stated that a six-year boy had got into the cab of the locomotive and accidentally released the brakes.

In 2010, there were over 18.3 million households connected to the Internet in the United Kingdom, with 63% of these having a broadband connection. There are also many public Internet access points such as public libraries and Internet cafes.Internet Access 70% of households had access in 2009, National Statistics Online. In 2009, an online survey undertaken by Harris Interactive on behalf of the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) stated that of 3,442 people surveyed in the UK, 1,012 (29%) reported downloading music from peer to peer networks, giving an indication of the level of file sharing occurring in the UK.Growing Threat From Illegal Web Downloads, 18 December 2009. A survey by XTN Data in 2006 found that of the 1000 people interviewed, 28% admitted to having downloaded copyrighted material without paying for it.John Oates Thousands more file sharers sued, 4 April 2006. Legislation The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 and the Digital Economy Act 2010 are applicable to and may be breached by file sharing activity. The Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 aims to protect the intellectual property rights of the creator or copyright holder. File sharing violates this act when the copyright owner has not given permission for its material to be shared.Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The Digital Economy Act 2017 changed the penalties related to copyright infringement. The legislation is concerned more directly with copyright on the Internet than previous legislation that was more concerned with commercial abuse of copyright.Factsheet: Digital Economy Act – contents and commencement. Action to prevent illegal file sharing Institutions such as the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) sought help from the government to force Internet service providers (ISPs) to identify those users suspected of file sharing and to take action against them. With the backing of the government this was made part of the Digital Economy Act and passed into law after parliamentary debate in April 2010.Digital Economy Act 2010 becomes law, 9 April 2010. A list of domain names affected by court orders is maintained on the website ukispcourtorders.co.uk by BT plc,http://whois.domaintools.com/ukispcourtorders.co.uk a similar list is hosted by Sky.https://community.talktalk.co.uk/t5/Articles/Blocked- websites/ta-p/2204638 As a result of this pressure, the five main ISPs (BT, Virgin Media, Sky, TalkTalk, EE) became responsible for the notification of users identified by the BPI. The notification will be a cease and desist order that will threaten legal action if the behaviour continues or if a compensation payment is not made. Further steps can also be taken by ISP's, if the identified users continue to breach copyright, such as the restriction of the bandwidth available to them or even total disconnection and possible bans or suspensions from the Internet. The movie industry has also signed up to seek action against those it has determined to be persistent infringers of its copyrights.Nate Lanxon, Government wins: Major UK ISPs forced to fight piracy for BPI, 24 July 2008. However, amendments proposed in 2010 to the Digital Economy Bill by the industry regulator Ofcom, made ISPs with fewer than 400,000 subscribers exempt. Also exempt are ISPs that provide mobile broadband access due in part to the way in which this service operates. One of the main reasons for providing the exemption is the costs and time-scale required for smaller ISPs to put the monitoring in place.Tom Jowitt, Ofcom Lets Small ISPs Off Filesharing Laws, 19 May 2010. The legality of the software used by ISPs to monitor the Internet activity of suspected illegal file-sharers has itself been called into question because of concerns over the privacy issues that its use raises. Virgin Media want to use new software called Cview, which monitors activity and compares any downloaded material to a database of copyrighted material in order to determine if there has been an infringement. As of 2010 this software was being evaluated for suitability by the European Commission and Ofcom with particular attention to whether the software violates privacy or data protection directives.Dinah Greek, European Commission to monitor Virgin Media's use of CView Computeractive, 28 January 2010. The music industry in Britain is not the only industry to seek action against illegal file sharing. The computer games industry, worth an estimated £2 billion, also sought compensation for copyright infringement. Five major game companies: Atari, Codemasters, TopWare Interactive, Reality Pump and Techland, sent notices to over 25,000 UK Internet users they feel have breached their copyright by downloading or sharing games on file sharing websites. The companies demanded a payment of £300 in order to settle the matter out of court, warning that non-payment would result in legal action. In what was a landmark case in terms of file sharing, one company, Topware Interactive, took a user, Isabella Barwinska, to court over copyright infringement of its game Dream Pinball 3D, which had been illegally downloaded, uploaded, and shared with many other users. The court found in favour of Topware Interactive and imposed a penalty of £16,000. In July 2010 the music company, Ministry of Sound, also sent notices to Internet users it claimed had breached its copyright by downloading music tracks. Notices were sent to around 2,000 users via London lawyers Gallant Macmillan demanding a compensation payment of around £350 in order to avoid legal action. Many users have challenged these claims, stating either their innocence or challenging the legality of the action taken.Miles Brignall, File sharers targeted with legal action over music, The Guardian, 17 July 2010. The BPI, however, does not support mass mailing to end users, preferring to target persistent uploaders who make copyrighted material available to others and persistent downloaders. The BPI has also complained to Google about illegal downloads and the ease with which these can be located or identified using its search engine, believing that Google has a responsibility to help prevent access to such material and that links to the infringing materials should be removed. This material is not actually hosted by Google, but by sites locatable through the use of Google's services.Nicole Kobie, BPI complains to Google over music downloads, 22 June 2010. April 2012 saw the UK high court order five leading UK ISPs to block access to Swedish file sharing website The Pirate Bay.Josh Halliday, British ISPs will block The Pirate Bay.... The case was brought after the ISPs refused to block the site voluntarilyBBC, The Pirate Bay must be blocked by UK ISPs, court rules. and after one ISP was ordered to block a similar site Newzbin2 in July 2011.BBC, BT ordered to block links to Newzbin 2 website. Discussions between the Intellectual Property Office, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and search engines Google and Bing led to the announcement in February 2017 of a voluntary code of practice, under which websites associated with copyright violation would be demoted within search engine rankings. Implementation was expected to begin by the summer of that year. =Opposition= There are groups which actively oppose the actions taken by institutions like BPI and the government's copyright policy, most of these groups are opposed to either the criminalisation of file sharers or the privacy infringements from Internet monitoring. The Open Rights Group and Pirate Party UK are prominent examples. These groups are opposed to the copyright infringement provisions of the Digital Economy Act. UK ISP TalkTalk has openly stated that they will refuse to send warning letters to their customers or hand over any of their personal information, even if it became a legal requirement for them to do so. TalkTalk has stated that the \\"government's plans to punish people suspected of illegal downloading are an assault on human rights\\",TalkTalk says piracy law infringes human rights . and pledged to fight government anti-piracy laws. In 2010 TalkTalk launched a major campaign, Don't Disconnect Us, against government plans to disconnect connections suspected of repeat copyright infringement.Don't Disconnect Us. Opposition has also come from English comedian, actor, writer, and director, Stephen Fry, who has defended non-commercial \\"piracy\\", supported TalkTalk's Don't Disconnect Us campaign and admitted to using BitTorrent to download episodes of House and 24.

It is native to Eurasia, but it is known on other continents as an introduced species and sometimes a weed. In North America, it is a common weed of grain crops in the Canadian prairie provinces and in much of the United States.North American Plant Protection Organization It grows in fields and in other disturbed habitat. Description Wild Night-Flowering Catchfly in Behbahan The night-flowering catchfly is an annual herb producing a hairy, glandular stem up to about 75 or 80 centimeters in maximum height. It is sticky in texture. The hairy, widely lance-shaped leaves grow in opposite pairs and are up to 14 centimeters long and 5 wide, the largest ones located low on the stem. The flowers are nocturnal,Flora of North America and occur in an open cyme of up to fifteen blooms, each borne on an erect pedicel. The flower is encapsulated in a hairy calyx of fused sepals lined with a netlike pattern of veining. The five petals are white to pink and each has two lobes at the tip. They measure up to 2.5 centimeters wide when fully open. The fruit is a yellowish-brown capsule with six chambers which splits open to release the seeds. Ecology As night falls the flowers of the night-flowering catchfly open and release a strong fragrance which attracts night-flying moths which feed on the copious nectar and pollinate the plant. Research Besides being a competitive weed, the night-flowering catchfly is host to some plant pathogens that can spread to crop plants, including tobacco streak virus and Lychnis ringspot virus. The mitochondrial genome of this species has been sequenced. It is 6.7 megabases long, which is very large compared to some other Silene species such as Silene vulgaris (0.43 megabases), is one of the largest sequenced plant mitochondrial genomes (the largest is Silene conica at 11.3 megabases), and consists of 59 small chromosomes.Mitochondrial genome studyNCBI sequenced plant mitochondrial genomes References External links *Jepson Manual Treatment *USDA Plants Profile *Washington Burke Museum *Photo gallery noctiflora Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Night-blooming plants ","title":"Silene noctiflora"},{"id":"28270901","text":"The Polonnaruwa massacre was a series of attacks on civilians in the villages of Alanchipothana, Karapola, Madurangala and Muthugal in eastern Polonnaruwa District, Sri Lanka on 29 April 1992 which left 157 dead. The massacres were blamed on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Sri Lankan Home Guards and the Sri Lankan Police. Alanchipothana At around 12.30am on 29 April 1992 30–40 Tamil Tigers, allegedly aided by Tamil villagers, attacked the Muslim village of Alanchipothana (also known as Allipothana, Alinghipothana and Alinchipotana) in Polonnaruwa district. The first target was a police post on the outskirts of the village. 26 policemen, 12 Home Guards and 35 volunteers were based at the police post. Most of these fled into the rice fields and jungle. The attackers then shot and hacked to death villagers sleeping in their homes. 54 dead bodies, including 25 women and 21 children under 10, were found at the village after the attack. The injured were taken to hospitals in Polonnaruwa, Kandy and Colombo where a further 8 died of their injuries. Karapola and Muthugal At around 6am on 29 April 1992 the Home Guards and policemen from Alanchipothana went to the police post at the Tamil village of Karapola and informed the policemen there of the attack on Alanchipothana. The policemen from Karapola and the Home Guards and policemen from Alanchipothana then went to Muthugal, another Tamil village, and shot and hacked to death dozens of villagers. They returned to Karapola where they killed dozens of villagers. Then, at around 9am, they went to Muthugal again and continued their killings. 51 villagers, including 13 children under 10, were killed at Muthugal. 38 villagers were killed in Karapola. The army camp at Welikande (9 km from Alanchipothana) was informed of the attacks at 6.30am but it took until 10am for the Army to arrive at Muthugal and put an end to the killings. The Home Guards and policemen were chased away. Madurangala Some of villagers from Muthugal who had fled the killings were found by Home Guards hiding in ricefields at Madurangala, a Sinhalese village. Six of the Muthugal villagers (five men and one woman) were arrested by the Home Guards. The woman was released but on 30 April 1992 the bodies of the five men plus a man from Madurangala were found in an irrigation canal.

Lieutenant Colonel Sir Francis Claude Shelmerdine (25 October 1881 – July 1945) was a senior officer in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War and a civil servant working in connection with civil aviation in the post-war years. Most significantly, he was Director-General of Civil Aviation during the 1930s.  Early life  Francis Claude Shelmerdine was born at Churchill, Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire on 25 October 1881, son of the Rev. Nathaniel and Mrs Emma Shelmerdine. He had an older brother and sister, Nathaniel and Constance, and one younger sister, Edith. He was educated at Rugby School and then at Sandhurst. He was commissioned a second lieutenant from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in January 1901. He subsequently lived in South Africa, and worked as a cotton planter.  First World War  Shelmerdine served in France and in Egypt and in November 1915, was transferred from Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own Yorkshire Regiment (unofficially known as the Green Howards at that time) to the Royal Flying Corps. In 1919, as a Lieutenant-Colonel, Shelmerdine joined the staff of the Civil Aviation Department at the Air Ministry. When Brigadier-General Festing was Controller of Aerodromes and Licences, Shelmerdine became his assistant, and when the department became a directorate and Festing left, Shelmerdine took on the role. He was later dispatched to Cairo to ensure the smooth-running of the Cairo to Karachi air service. In 1927 he was posted to India, to serve as the Director of Civil Aviation there. He returned to the Air Ministry in 1931 as the home country's Director of Civil Aviation following the death of Sir Sefton Branker who was killed in the R101 airship crash. Shelmerdine was Director General of Civil Aviation from 1934 to 1941, when he had to retire under age regulations.  Personal life  He was married to Mary Cecily O'Nolan-Martin in Durban, South Africa, (where he was working as a cotton planter) in 1908. There was one child, Rosamonde, born in London in 1910, who lived solely with her mother from 1911. He disputed her parentage, and there was a court case in 1912. His drug habit was cited in this case. Mary Cecily filed for divorce in 1924. He was subsequently married to Lillian Sealey Playne, formerly Hanham, (née Haskins), Lady Shelmerdine (17 September 1884 – 11 July 1956) at St George's Hanover Square in 1925.

Dream Center Matthew's father, Tommy Barnett, is pastor of the Dream City Church megachurch in Phoenix, Arizona. In September 1994 his church purchased the Queen of Angels Hospital, a Los Angeles landmark in the ramshackle Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. The building was converted for use as a soup kitchen, a group home for runaways, prostitutes and gang members, and a shelter for the homeless. It also provided job training and religious services. By 1997 Matthew, then 23, was managing the day-to-day operations of what was to be called The Dream Center. The Dream Center now reaches over 35,000 people each week in 273 ministries and outreaches. The center is open 24/7. An important role is rehabilitating drug addicts, who account for about half its residents, including underage teens. Angelus Temple In November 2001 the Angelus Temple, founded in 1923 by Aimee Semple McPherson, merged with The Dream Center and Matthew Barnett became senior pastor of both churches. At the time of the merger, Angelus Temple was a long way from its glory days as one of the largest churches in the nation. Its main sanctuary had not been used on a regular basis in several years. A 1,000-member Hispanic congregation met in a nearby auditorium, while its main congregation had been reduced to only 25 elderly people. At the same time, the Dream Center was holding services in a packed gym. Through an agreement between the Assemblies of God and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, Barnett took over as pastor of Angelus Temple, while retaining his Assemblies of God ordination. The temple's sanctuary was renovated at a cost of $7 million and is now used for Dream Center services. Barnett received the Religious Heritage Award in 1999. U.S. President George W. Bush endorsed his ministry and expressed high regard for his achievements.

In the 1850s his father had purchased the manor of Heanton Punchardon, near Barnstaple, and lived at Heanton Court. This manor had long been owned by the Basset family which had died out in the male line in 1802 on the death of Francis Basset Esq. The latter appointed as his heir his nephew Joseph Davie (1764–1846), of Orleigh Court, in Buckland Brewer parish near Bideford, the son of his sister Eleanora Basset and her husband John Davie. As a condition of his inheritance Joseph Davie adopted the name and arms of Basset. He sold Orleigh in 1807 to Charles Luxmore and moved to Berrynarbor where he built Watermouth Castle. He married Mary Irwin (1777 - 21 April 1862) of Barnstaple. A mural monument to the couple exists in Berrynarbor Church. His eldest son and heir was Arthur Davie Bassett (1801 - 8 December 1870), who died in a horse-riding accident. He married Harriet Sarah Crawfurth, daughter of Thomas Smith Crawfurth of Dulverton, by whom he had his eldest surviving son Re.

The group, formed in 1977, have been well known throughout Scottish football for their boisterous, vociferous and often violent behaviour for over 40 years. The group is widely regarded as one of the most violent gangs in Scotland. Section B have featured in several publications over the years, including The Idler Book of Crap Towns II (2004), Hooligans (September 2005 and updated September 2007), Front Magazine (February 2006) and Lifted Over The Turnstiles (DC Thomson, 2018). In March 2020, Section B were discussed on BBC Radio Scotland's Off The Ball programme. Formation During the late 1960s and early to mid-1970s the town of Airdrie often witnessed hooliganism and misbehaviour in and around the old Broomfield Park where Airdrieonians played. The larger clubs — namely Celtic, Rangers, Hearts and Hibs, would typically have an element of their support that would often cause bother with the local fans. Section B were formed as a direct response to this threat, and were originally made up of an amalgamation of smaller groups of gangs from around the town. This diverse mixture combined punks, mods and others. Contrary to popular belief, Section B were not named after the area of terracing where they mainly stood, but in tribute to a local punk bandAbout Us, Section B by the same name who were active at the time.

Such issues are often raised in connection with discussions about human rights, animal rights, biocentrism, or sentiocentrism. Philosophy Samuel Butler's Erewhon contains a chapter, \\"The Views of an Erewhonian Philosopher Concerning the Rights of Vegetables\\". On the question of whether animal rights can be extended to plants, animal rights philosopher Tom Regan argues that animals acquire rights due to being aware, what he calls \\"subjects-of-a-life\\". He argues that this does not apply to plants, and that even if plants did have rights, abstaining from eating meat would still be moral due to the use of plants to rear animals. According to philosopher Michael Marder, the idea that plants should have rights derives from \\"plant subjectivity\\", which is distinct from human personhood. Paul W. Taylor holds that all life has inherent worth and argues for respect for plants, but does not assign them rights. Christopher D. Stone, the son of investigative journalist I. F. Stone, proposed in a 1972 paper titled \\"Should Trees Have Standing?\\" that, if corporations are assigned rights, so should natural objects such as trees. Citing the broadening of rights of blacks, Jews, women, and fetuses as examples, Stone explains that, throughout history, societies have been conferring rights to new \\"entities\\" which, at the time, people thought to be \\"unthinkable.\\" Whilst not appealing directly to \\"rights\\", Matthew Hall has argued that plants should be included within the realm of human moral consideration. His \\"Plants as Persons: A Philosophical Botany\\" discusses the moral background of plants in western philosophy and contrasts this with other traditions, including indigenous cultures, which recognise plants as persons—active, intelligent beings that are appropriate recipients of respect and care. Hall backs up his call for the ethical consideration of plants with arguments based on plant neurobiology, which says that plants are autonomous, perceptive organisms capable of complex, adaptive behaviours, including the recognition of self/non-self. Scientific arguments In the study of plant physiology, plants are understood to have mechanisms by which they recognize environmental changes. This definition of plant perception differs from the notion that plants are capable of feeling emotions, an idea also called plant perception. The latter concept, along with plant intelligence, can be traced to 1848, when Gustav Theodor Fechner, a German experimental psychologist, suggested that plants are capable of emotions, and that one could promote healthy growth with talk, attention, and affection.Michael Heidelberger Nature from within: Gustav Theodor Fechner and his psychophysical worldview 2004, p. 54 The Swiss Federal Ethics Committee on Non-Human Biotechnology analyzed scientific data on plants, and concluded in 2009 that plants are entitled to a certain amount of \\"dignity\\", but \\"dignity of plants is not an absolute value.\\" The single-issue Party for Plants entered candidates in the 2010 parliamentary election in the Netherlands. It focuses on topics such as climate, biodiversity and sustainability in general. Such concerns have been criticized as evidence that modern culture is \\"causing us to lose the ability to think critically and distinguish serious from frivolous ethical concerns\\". Legal arguments Justice William O. Douglas, author of a noted dissent about the legal standing of plants In his dissent to the 1972 Sierra Club v. Morton decision by the United States Supreme Court, Justice William O. Douglas wrote about whether plants might have legal standing: The Swiss Constitution contains a provision requiring \\"account to be taken of the dignity of creation when handling animals, plants and other organisms\\", and the Swiss government has conducted ethical studies pertaining to how the dignity of plants is to be protected. In 2012, a river in New Zealand, including the plants and other organisms contained within its boundaries, was legally declared a person with standing (via guardians) to bring legal actions to protect its interests.Vines T, Bruce A Faunce TA.

Journal of Law and Medicine 2013; 20: 528 available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2235935 (accessed 28 March 2013) Popular arguments When challenged by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to become vegetarian, Timothy McVeigh argued that \\"plants are alive too, they react to stimuli (including pain); have circulation systems, etc\\". The Animal Liberation Front argues that there is no evidence that plants can experience pain, and that to the extent they respond to stimuli, it is like a device such as a thermostat responding to sensors.

The episode was written by Aaron Ehasz and directed by Crystal Chesney-Thompson. American comedian Patton Oswalt guest stars in the episode, voicing an \\"unattractive giant monster\\". In the episode, Bender duplicates himself into two smaller copies in order to avoid work. However, the duplicates also want to avoid work, so they create their own smaller duplicates, resulting in a vast number of increasingly smaller copies of Bender ultimately threatening to consume all of the matter on Earth. The premise of \\"Benderama\\" is the grey goo theory, an end-of-the-world scenario in which out-of-control self-replicating robots consume all matter on Earth while building more of themselves. \\"Benderama\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised Patton Oswalt's guest appearance and noted that it was an improvement over the preceding episode \\"Neutopia\\". Plot The Professor invents a machine that can scan an object and produce two smaller copies, consuming matter provided to it in the process. He uses it to make smaller sweaters for himself, since he is shrinking and feeling colder as he ages. Bender originally refuses the Professor's request to fold them, and then stuffs the replicator into his chest cavity and uses it to make two duplicates of himself so they can each fold one sweater. Before they can do so, the Planet Express crew (including the two new Benders) is sent to deliver a shipment of personal hygiene products to an ugly, giant alien humanoid who lives in a cave. He endures the crew's comments about his appearance until Fry inadvertently insults his mother, causing him to lash out and nearly destroy the ship before it escapes. Back on Earth, Bender's two duplicates (each of whom has a small version of the Professor's replicator in his chest) copy themselves in order to get four cigars for Bender. The process continues until there are 11 generations of Benders running around the office; the crew quickly moves in to exterminate all the duplicates, but Bender admits to setting one free. As this one gives rise to a new swarm that keeps reproducing and consuming matter, including Bender's couch and beer, the Professor worries that they will eventually eat the Earth. Leela points out that since the Benders are fueled by alcohol, they will run out of power once they have used up the world's supply. When this happens, the crew sweeps up the Benders and flushes them down the toilet. As the Professor takes a bath, he is surprised to find that the water in the tub has turned into alcohol. Some of the Benders survived and have reached the atomic/molecular scale, where they can synthesize alcohol directly from water and carbon dioxide molecules. As a result, the entire population of Earth becomes extremely drunk and the planet's fresh water supply is gone. At this point, the giant alien arrives on Earth to apologize for his earlier outburst, even though the crew keeps drunkenly insulting him and Zapp Brannigan tries to destroy him with a tank. Unable to get hold of the therapist who has been helping him deal with his anger issues, the alien flies into another rage and starts tearing up the city. Bender, the only sober crew member, agrees to fight the alien if Fry will fold the Professor's two sweaters. Bender uses the hordes of tiny duplicates to form \\"Big Bender\\" and fight the alien hand-to- hand. He loses the fight after insulting the alien's mother, but the swarm quickly consumes the alien to leave only dust. Bender urges them to help him solve other worldwide problems, but they are too lazy to take part and leave Earth instead. As the other crew members recover from a terrible hangover the next morning, the Professor is happy to note that someone finally folded his sweaters. When Fry asks Bender if he did this and learned a lesson about being lazy, Bender cryptically replies that perhaps he did, or perhaps he kept one of the mini-Benders around to do the job for him. He then exhales cigar smoke, which turns out to be composed of thousands of microscopic, maniacally laughing Benders. Production The episode was written by Aaron Ehasz and directed by Crystal Chesney-Thompson. Before its airing, the first act of the episode was read by the show's voice actors at Futurama's 2010 San Diego Comic Con panel. =Cultural references= \\"Benderama\\" features an episode of \\"The Scary Door\\", Futurama's ongoing parody of anthology television series The Twilight Zone. Bender says the line, \\"Hi, I'm Bender, this is my robot Bender and this is my other robot Bender.\\"; this is a reference to the TV series Newhart, specifically the character of Larry, who introduced himself and his brothers with the line, \\"Hi, I'm Larry, this is my brother Darryl and this is my other brother Darryl.\\" Broadcast and reception \\"Benderama\\" originally aired June 23, 2011 on Comedy Central, immediately following the episode \\"Neutopia\\". In its original American broadcast, \\"Benderama\\" was viewed by an estimated 2.473 million households with a 1.1 rating in the 18–49 demographic. \\"Benderama\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club wrote: \\"'Benderama' works because the script holds together, starting from the original premise, and then introducing complications over time.\\" He graded the episode A-, praising the premise of the episode, as well as Patton Oswalt's voice work in the episode. Sean Gandert of Paste, reviewing both \\"Benderama\\" and \\"Neutopia\\", wrote: \\"Both of these are what other shows would call gimmick episodes, but with Futurama pretty much everything is a one-off and taking on these strange premises is really what the show's about.\\" He gave both episodes an 8.4, and added: \\"If these two are any indicator, there's a good summer of episodes to look forward to.\\" Blair Marnell of CraveOnline wrote: \\"'Benderama' had a lot of fun moments that helped negate the bad taste left behind by 'Neutopia'.\\" He rated the episode 8/10. However, Marnell wrote that the writers should refrain from reusing what he called \\"'Bender uses experiment x' storylines\\", adding \\"There are only so many ways to reuse a plot and I don't want to see this series go downhill before its time.\\" See also *Grey goo References External links  Category:Futurama (season 6) episodes Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Self-replicating machines in fiction Category:Television episodes about nanotechnology ","title":"Benderama"},{"id":"28271179","text":"The Emergency Committee for Israel is a right-wing 501(c)(4) political advocacy organization in the United States. The group's board members include Weekly Standard editor William Kristol, former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer, and former member, conservative writer Rachel Abrams, wife of Elliott Abrams. Noah Pollak is its executive director. Kristol said his group, created in mid-2010, was inspired by the new \\"liberal\\" J Street group, \\"whose ability to amplify criticism of the Israeli government showed the power of a small new group—if on the other side of the debate.\\" Pollak said, shortly after the group's creation, that it planned to be involved in a number of congressional races. \\"We want to be hard-hitting; we want to get into the debate and shake things up and make some points in a firm way\\", he said. As it started up, the organization ran ads opposing the elections of U.S. Senate candidate Joe Sestak and U.S. House of Representatives candidates Rush D. Holt, Jr., Mary Jo Kilroy, and John F. Tierney, portraying them as \\"openly hostile\\" to Israel. In October 2011, the committee produced a video portraying Occupy Wall Street as anti-Semitic. Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen referred to the video and said he found no evidence of antisemitism during his two visits to the demonstration site. In February 2012, the committee produced a 30-minute documentary covering President Barack Obama's record on Israel. The documentary was viewed 200,000 times in its first week. In June 2012, the committee ran an ad encouraging the US Government to immediately put an end to Iran's nuclear program. The ad ran in New York; Washington, DC; and additional markets. In October 2012, the group released a robo-call which combined clips of Obama from 2009 and 2011 and a clip from a speech Benjamin Netanyahu gave in 2012, in a form that appeared as if the two were having a debate. Pollak said that month that his group would release further \\"secret Obama—Netanyahu debate recordings\\".

Erdman wanted to create an investment group with former professional athletes and use their celebrity power to sell the product. TNC's celebrity investors were Pat Summerall, Whitey Ford, Dick Lynch, and Jim Katcavage. Trans-National Communications holdings included over 100 radio stations, the radio broadcast rights to the New York Jets and the New York Giants, the Bank of Philadelphia, film companies, and farms. On March 2, 1969, Trans-National Communications purchased the Oakland Seals from Barry Van Gerbig for $4.5 million. TNC's control of the Seals ended after one season after they missed a payment to van Gerbig and fell into default. On August 13, 1969, Trans-National Communications purchased the Boston Celtics for a record $6 million. TNC and its president Woody Erdman attempted to use profits from the Celtics to cover the losses from the company's bad investments. As a result, the team struggled to pay its bills. Some businesses refused to take checks from the Celtics while TNC owned them and General Manager Red Auerbach had to pay some bills out of his own pocket.

Plot synopsis Chris wakes up one morning sporting a priapism as he took an entire packet of Viagra the previous day. Chris feeds his fish speed and heads for downstairs. He finds a note from his mum saying she has left 'for a few days', and an envelope full of money (£1000 in total). Chris decides to blow the money, of course, on a wild house party. He invites all of his friends, and the love of his life, his psychology teacher, Angie. Initially irritated that Chris lied to her about other teachers coming, Angie eventually gives in and agrees to dance with him. She leaves in disgust, however, when she feels his Viagra- fueled erection. The next day, searching for money to pay for a pizza delivery, Chris discovers that all of his mum's clothes are gone, that she has moved out of the house. In dire need of money, Chris tries to return a recently purchased CD player despite it having a pop-tart stuck in the disc drive. He eventually sells the player to a scrapyard, but depressed by his new financial situation, accepts the payment for it in ecstasy. One morning, after further partying when Chris's house is in ruins, Chris finds a squatter asleep in his bathroom. Chris tries to kick him out, but the man protests and eventually claims squatters' rights. He locks a naked Chris out of his own house, informing him he will only let him in if they can come to an agreement. Chris, however, wanders off. At college, Chris's friends find clothes for him. Jal convinces him to go to his dad, but Chris is reluctant. At his dad's house, Chris's stepmother is pleased to see him, although slightly awkward, and reveals that he has a new baby half-brother, although Chris is not thrilled at the idea. Chris's stepmother shows him a photo of himself when he was a baby, but Chris corrects her, telling her that it was his older brother, Peter. Chris's dad arrives home, but refuses to see him, so Chris runs away, miserable. Jal catches up to him in a graveyard, and he tells her of a fond memory he has of his brother when they were kids. Jal, it seems, had no idea that Chris even had a brother. Chris tells Jal that he knows his mother is still around because she left flowers by Peter's grave. Now, more depressed than ever, Chris is surprised to find that Angie has found him a place, Roundview College Student Accommodation. He moves into his new flat graciously with his few possessions, and gets a new goldfish which he keeps in a pint glass.

Founded in 1883, it is one of the oldest operating ferry companies in America. Service The Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry operates between Port Jefferson, NY and Bridgeport, CT, and the service currently consists of three vessels and two terminals. Each vessel contains a dual-level car deck with capacity ranging from 90 to 120, often selling out on the popular summer weekends. Advance reservations can be made on the ferry company's website at www.88844ferry.com. The ferry company also carries larger vehicles like trucks and RVs. Travel time is approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes, with departures running every hour if 3 boats are in service (On weekends and throughout the summer) or every 90 minutes with 2 boats in service (On off-season weekdays). The ferry company's Bridgeport terminal (Built in 1992) contains a ticket kiosk (Mainly for walk-on passengers) as well as a snack bar. The smaller Port Jefferson terminal does not have a snack bar, but does have a ticket kiosk. History The first ferry service began in 1872 and proved popular. The Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Steamboat Company was subsequently founded in 1883 by several backers, including entrepreneur P.T. Barnum, and Port Jefferson seaman Charles E. Tooker. The ferry company originally operated steamship service, but the acquisition of the Martha's Vineyard in 1968 ended steamship service. Since then, the company has been referred to in signage and conversation as the Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry, but the term Steamboat Company is still used legally. Since 1980, the President has been Brian McAllister who also owns one hundred percent of the company's shares. The McAllisters purchased the company in 1960 from Joseph Tooker, Charles Tooker's grandson. During the 1980s, the ferry company offered year-round service for the first time in company’s history. The company procured the Grand Republic in 1983 (not to be confused with the current Grand Republic, built in 2003) and the Park City in 1986 to meet skyrocketing ridership. In 1999, with the launching of the PT Barnum, the ferry company began operating hourly, three-vessel service on weekends, holidays, and during the summer. The ferry company still operates only two vessels on off-season weekdays, with departures every 90 minutes. A new Grand Republic was procured in 2003, while the old one was sold to Cross Sound Ferry and renamed the Mary Ellen. On May 29, 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a United States District Court for the District of Connecticut ruling that the Bridgeport Port Authority was unconstitutionally collecting taxes from the ferry company and passengers. The port authority was ordered to pay the ferry company $1.1 million in reparations. In 2013, the ferry company unveiled plans to move its Bridgeport dock across Bridgeport Harbor to a new and larger terminal. The city approved the plan in April 2014, and the new terminal is slated to open in 2020. In June 2016, the Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry made significant changes to its ticketing system. Tickets were for many years purchased while on board the vessel (at a purser's booth) and turned in to a crew member before walking or driving off. However, in June 2016, the new ticket system was implemented, where tickets are purchased and turned in before b oarding the vessel. Tickets are sold online, over the phone, and inside the terminals. The new tickets contain bar codes, which are scanned prior to boarding, and can also be displayed over a cell phone or mobile device. As of 2017, the Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry carries approximately 1.3 million passengers and 500,000 vehicles annually. Ports The distance between the two ports is approximately . The average crossing is one hour and fifteen minutes in duration. =Bridgeport= The ferry is located at 330 Water Street on the western bank of Bridgeport Harbor. It is within walking distance of the Arena at Harbor Yard, the Ballpark at Harbor Yard, the Barnum Museum, the Metro- North station, the main GBTA Bus Station, the Klein Memorial Auditorium, and most of downtown. In 2004 a new car loading ramp was installed featuring AASHTO HS-20 truck capacity. The aforementioned proposed new terminal will be located on Seaview Avenue at the former site of Turbana Corporation. =Port Jefferson= The ferry is located at 102 West Broadway at the head of the harbor. A large gold leaf statue of an eagle was erected on the corner of East Broadway and NY 25A in 2002, replacing one of Thomas Jefferson. Directly across from the dock, it is a monument for victims of 9/11. The ferry is approximately one mile north of the Port Jefferson LIRR station. Current fleet There are currently three vessels in service. Each vessel is configured similarly, with a second level containing a small deck near the back, a large passenger cabin in the middle, with restrooms, seating and a snack bar, and a cocktail lounge (for passengers 21 and over) near the front. A third level contains more outdoor seating, as well as the bridge and helm elevated above the third deck. All three vessels have elevators from the car deck to the second and third levels, located near the back of each vessel. Each vessel is capable of traveling at speeds of . =MV Park City= The MV Park City was built in 1986 by Offshore Shipbuilding in Palatka, Florida at a cost of $5 million, originally to supplement the original MV Grand Republic. It is long and wide with capacity for 90 cars. It is the second vessel in the company's history to use the name Park City; the prior vessel, , was operated by company from 1898 to 1950. The Park City has received several midlife upgrades in recent years to keep it in line with the two newer vessels. In 2009, her engines were replaced with two brand-new Tier II Caterpillars, and in 2012, her main cabin received a $2 million renovation to replace seats, flooring, ceilings, and add an ADA-compliant elevator and restrooms. =MV P.T. Barnum= The MV PT Barnum was built in 1999 by Eastern Marine Shipbuilding in Panama City, Florida. It is long and wide, and is named after the ferry company's co-founder, Bridgeport entrepreneur and circus impresario PT Barnum. She is capable of carrying 120 cars and was constructed at a cost of $12 million. =MV Grand Republic= The MV Grand Republic was built in 2003 by Eastern Marine Shipbuilding in Panama City, FL. She is the sister ship to the PT Barnum, with both vessels having been built to near-identical specifications, with only minor mechanical and cosmetic differences between the two vessels. Former fleet * Grand Republic The name Grand Republic was previously used for an older and slightly smaller vessel built in 1983. It was built in commemoration of the ferry company's centennial, by Offshore Shipbuilding in Palatka, FL, who would also build the MV Park City 3 years later (The two boats were built to similar but not identical specifications). The slightly smaller Grand Republic had the same length as the Park City, but it was only wide. The old Grand Republic was sold to competitor Cross Sound Ferry in March 2003. Cross Sound Ferry renovated the vessel, renamed it the Mary Ellen and placed it back in service on their route between New London, Connecticut and Orient, New York that June, where it remains in service as of 2020. * ' - Before the (1983) Grand Republic, this steel hulled diesel-powered ship ran seasonally (no winter service) with six round trips a day from 1968. It was built in Bath, Maine in 1923, and was previously used by the Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard, and Nantucket Steamship Authority. It was the first vessel in the company's history that was capable of carrying automobiles, having capacity for 30. It was sold in 1986 to Massachusetts Bay Lines after the MV Park City was built. Massachusetts Bay Lines intended to convert her into a dinner cruise ship, but never did, and the Martha's Vineyard was ultimately scrapped in 1990. * Catskill - The Catskill was built in 1924 to replace the Nonowantuc, and was the first steel-hulled vessel in the company's history. It was named after the Catskill mountains in upstate New York. It was sold 1968 after the Martha's Vineyard was bought. * Park City - A previous Park City served from 1898 through 1951. Its name was derived from the city of Bridgeport's nickname. Built for $50,000, wide/ long 898 gross tons, 800 horsepower, 15 knots. Coal (hard)powered. * Nonowantuc - The first vessel in the Bridgeport & Port Jefferson Ferry's history, serving from 1883 to 1924. It was slightly smaller than the 1898 Park City, but also featured masts if the boilers failed.

American actor Tom Kenny guest stars in the episode, voicing recurring character Yancy Fry, Jr., as well as astronaut Buzz Aldrin, voicing himself. In the episode, Fry inadvertently reintroduces the common cold to the 31st century. The situation links to Fry's past, and flashbacks are shown depicting his entry in a NASA science competition and his relationship with his father. The episode was written by Dan Vebber and directed by Crystal Chesney-Thompson. On June 5 and June 6, as part of its \\"Countdown to Futurama\\" event, Comedy Central Insider, Comedy Central's news outlet, released two preview materials for the episode; a storyboard of Leela trying to escape the Planet Express building and a character design of Fry's guinea pig dressed in a spacesuit. \\"Cold Warriors\\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who enjoyed its emotional ending and felt that it recaptured the feel of the show's original run. Plot Fry catches the common cold during an ice fishing trip, though the rest of the Planet Express crew are unaware of what the disease is as it was eradicated 500 years ago. Professor Farnsworth explains that the common cold virus had survived within Fry while he was frozen for 1000 years and has thus been reintroduced to mankind, which has lost all resistance to the virus. During this time, flashbacks to the year 1988 show Fry taking an ice fishing trip with his father, during which he falls through the ice and catches a cold. Later, egged on by his brother Yancy, he decides to enter a science competition judged by Buzz Aldrin in which the winner's entry will be launched into space in a satellite. His idea is to infect his pet guinea pig with the cold virus and see if can be cured by exposure to cosmic rays. A rival competitor, Josh Gedgie, learns of Fry's entry and decides to create an experiment about the common cold as well. In the present day, the pathogens of the cold are detected and Planet Express is quarantined. Bender, who is immune to biological illness and forced to take care of the sick crew, becomes exasperated and breaks through the quarantine after being sneezed on by Zoidberg, spreading the virus across Manhattan. Richard Nixon becomes concerned with the rapid spread of the disease and brings in Ogden Wernstrom to resolve the situation. Wernstrom's solution is to destroy the virus by enclosing Manhattan in plastic wrap, lifting it into space, and hurling it into the Sun. Believing that a vaccine can be created using a sample of the original virus, Farnsworth plans to extract it from Fry by grinding his body into a paste, thereby killing him. Fry remembers that the winning science competition entry contained a virus sample. The crew escapes the city and finds the satellite containing the experiment, now encased in ice on Enceladus, with a flashback revealing that Gedgie's project won the competition, to the disappointment of Fry's father. As the Professor uses Gedgie's virus sample to create a vaccine, and Manhattan is set back in place and its residents are inoculated to stop the outbreak, Leela tells Fry that he should be proud of himself for saving millions of people, no matter what his father thought of him. Fry then has a flashback to the ice fishing trip with his father just after being pulled out of the ice, where Fry's father tells him that he loves him, and explains that he is only so hard on Fry because he wants Fry to grow up strong and resilient. He then tells Fry to keep warm, because he would hate it if his son were frozen. Cultural references The title of the episode itself is a reference to the situation between the United States and the Soviet Union, the Cold War. Production The episode was written by Dan Vebber, and directed by Crystal Chesney-Thompson. From June 5 to 6, as part of its \\"Countdown to Futurama\\" event, Comedy Central Insider, Comedy Central's news outlet, released two preview materials for the episode; concept art of Fry's guinea pig dressed up in astronaut's clothing, and storyboards of a scene featuring Leela trying to escape the quarantined Planet Express building. Additionally, two promotional pictures from the episode were released by Comedy Central Press. American actor Tom Kenny guest stars in the episode, voicing recurring character Yancy Fry, Jr., Philip J. Fry's brother. Astronaut Buzz Aldrin also guest stars in the episode, voicing himself. In a June 2011 interview with Assignment X, series creator David X. Cohen first revealed that Aldrin would guest star in the episode. Reception In its original U.S. broadcast, \\"Cold Warriors\\" scored a 0.7 share among adults 18-49 and 1.524 million viewers, up about 142,000 viewers from the previous week's episode \\"The Tip of the Zoidberg\\". The episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- rating, describing it as \\"an ambitious, consistently entertaining episode\\" and praising its story and humor. He did, however, note that some characters felt out of character in the episode, and felt that the episode did not achieve the same emotional effect that previous episodes with flashbacks to Fry's past, namely \\"The Luck of the Fryrish\\" and \\"Jurassic Bark\\", had. Sean Gandert of Paste, giving the episode an 8.5/10 rating, wrote: \\"There are more than the usual number of logical stretches required for 'Cold Warriors' to make sense, but the episode moves so swiftly through them that it still works well. Fry's science fair attempt isn't particularly interesting, either, but it has enough great moments to warrant so much of the episode being spent there. With the combination of showing for the first time a real closeness between Fry and his dad and what happens when an epidemic breaks loose in the future, it also broached some interesting new ground.\\" He praised the episode's emotional nature, and felt that the episode was a sign that Futurama was closer to recapturing the \\"magic of [its] original run.\\" Robert Canning of IGN was critical of \\"Cold Warriors\\", giving the episode a 6.5/10 rating. Canning felt that the episode fell short of his expectations, comparing it unfavorably to \\"The Luck of the Fryrish\\" and \\"Jurassic Bark\\". He also felt that the episode's use of flashbacks felt repetitive, as the previous week's episode \\"The Tip of the Zoidberg\\" had also used them in a similar manner. He described the episode's ending as its \\"biggest failure\\", writing: \\"...the biggest failure of the episode was that the 'should have been really emotional' ending just sort of happened without much of a connection with the audience. [...] Ultimately, this unsuccessful ending only served to weaken the already so-so story that came before it.\\" References External links  Category:2011 American television episodes Category:Futurama (season 6) episodes Category:Enceladus Category:Saturn's moons in fiction Category:Fiction set in the 1980s ","title":"Cold Warriors"},{"id":"28271286","text":"Kathryn \\"Katie\\" Theresa Schoepfer (born November 10, 1988) is an American former professional soccer player, having last played for the Boston Breakers of National Women's Soccer League in 2016.

Kohlsaat Herman Henry Kohlsaat (March 22, 1853 Albion, Illinois – October 17, 1924 Washington, D.C.) was an American businessman and newspaper publisher. Biography Herman Henry Kohlsaat was born March 22, 1853, in Albion, Illinois, one of six children of Reimer and Sarah (Hall) Kohlsaat. His father had been an officer in the Danish Army, and immigrated to the United States, settling in Albion in 1835. Kohlsaat's mother came from England to Illinois with her family in 1821. Reimer and Sarah Kohlsaat were abolitionists whose home was reportedly a station on the Underground Railroad. Kohlsaat's siblings included Christian C. Kohlsaat, who later became a well known jurist in Chicago. The year following Herman's birth, the family moved to Galena, Illinois, where he attended school and learned farm work until 1865, when they moved to Chicago. He attended school there for two years and in 1867 went to work as a carrier for the Chicago Tribune newspaper. Kohlsaat later worked for several Chicago merchants, including Carson Pirie Scott and Company. He became a traveling salesman, eventually working for Blake, Shaw and Company, a wholesale bakery owned by Ebenezer Nelson Blake, who was to become Kohlsaat's father-in-law. In 1880, Kohlsaat married Mabel E. Blake (1861–1959) and became a junior partner of Blake, Shaw in charge of a bakery-lunch establishment. In 1883 he bought out Blake, Shaw's interest in the establishment and started H.H. Kohlsaat and Company, which for thirty years was one of the largest baking establishments in Chicago. He became the originator of the \\"bakery lunch\\", and subsequently became successful in other enterprises. From 1891 to 1893, he was part owner of the Chicago Inter Ocean. In 1894 Kohlsaat abandoned his interest in the Inter Ocean, and purchased the Chicago Times Herald and Chicago Evening Post. From 1894 to 1901, he was editor and publisher of the Evening Post and the Times Herald. Under Kohlsaat's direction, the newspapers became increasingly involved in national politics. He converted the papers from Democratic Party to Republican Party organs. In 1901, the Times Herald was merged with the Chicago Record into the Chicago Record Herald, where he was editor from 1910 to 1912. In 1912 he bought the now-bankrupt Inter Ocean and shepherded it through receivership in 1914, when he combined it with the Record Herald, the new paper being known as the Chicago Herald. At that time, Kohlsaat retired from the publishing field. Kohlsaat was a friend, confidant and advisor of five U.S. presidents: William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, and Warren G. Harding. He helped draft the gold standard plank of the Republican Party's 1896 national convention in St. Louis. McKinley's campaign for president against William Jennings Bryan was ultimately won on the gold standard issue, with Kohlsaat one of his strongest allies. Kohlsaat visited McKinley at the White House in 1898. According to one published account, McKinley confided to Kohlsaat that he was having difficulty sleeping over an upcoming decision to go to war with Spain over Cuba. Kohlsaat later related that McKinley broke down in his presence and cried like a \\"boy of thirteen\\". In 1923, Charles Scribner's Sons published Kohlsaat's book From McKinley to Harding: Personal Recollections of Our Presidents.https://www.questia.com/library/719234/from-mckinley-to-harding- personal-recollections-of The book, a collection of short anecdotes featuring Kohlsaat's experiences with five presidents, serves as his memoirs. Kohlsaat also wrote several articles for the Saturday Evening Post in 1923 and 1924, including one about Ulysses S. Grant. Kohlsaat had a personal interest in Grant, presumably influenced by his early childhood in Galena. In 1891, Kohlsaat presented Galena with a monument of Grant for the city’s Grant Park. Kohlsaat died on October 17, 1924, in Washington, D.C., while in town to attend the 1924 World Series. He was staying at the home of Herbert Hoover, then Secretary of Commerce. A memorial tablet in the Washington National Cathedral is dedicated to Kohlsaat. Kohlsaat had two daughters. Pauline (1882–1956) married Potter Palmer II, son of a successful Chicago businessman. The Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois gives the Pauline K. Palmer Award for \\"exceptional commitment and service to children and families\\".Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois Katherine (1889–1991) married Roger Bulkley Shepard of St. Paul, Minnesota, and had four children: Roger Jr., Blake, Constance, and Stanley.

The 9th Hussar Regiment fought in the Napoleonic Wars, World War I and the Algerian War before finally being disbanded in 1979. History The regiment's ancestry is drawn from two separate units, one originating in a squadron of the Hussards de la Liberté and the other in the Régiment des Guides. =The Revolutionary Wars= Its origins lay in the Hussards de la Liberté, set up on 2 September 1792 and by a royal decree dated 23 November 1792. This unit was divided into two squadrons of 200 men each (the first squadron made up of volunteers from Paris and the second from volunteers from Lille) and came ninth in the army order of precedence by a decree of the French National Convention of 4 June 1793. On 25 March 1793, that unit's second squadron became the 10th Hussar Regiment (whilst on 1 May 1794 the first squadron of the Hussards de la Liberté became the 7e régiment bis de hussards). On 4 June 1794, after the defection of the 4th Hussar Regiment, the 10th Hussar Regiment was re-numbered as the 9th Hussar Regiment. In 1795, the regiment was involved in the Vendée Revolt. It was part of the Army of the Rhine in 1796 and the Army of the Danube in 1798. It was known as the Hussards Rouges or Red Hussars after its scarlet dolmans. =The Napoleonic Wars= Standard of the 9th Hussar Regiment It then formed part of the Grande Armée from 1805 onwards. In 1805 it took part in the Battle of Austerlitz. In 1806–07 it took part in the war of the fourth coalition in the battles of Jena–Auerstedt, Stettin and Friedland. In 1809 it took part in the war of the fifth coalition and charged at Eckmühl and Wagram In 1812 it took part in the French invasion of Russia, it took part in the battle of Borodino. In 1813–14 it took part in the war of the sixth coalition, it took part in the battle of Bautzen and Leipzig. What remained of the regiment after the retreat through Germany was converted into the régiment de Berry-hussards (with precedence number 6) on 12 May 1814. =In The Industrial Age= On 27 September 1840, by decree of Louis Philippe I of France, the 9th Hussars was re-created out of detachments from the 1st Hussar Regiment, 3rd Hussar Regiment, 4th Hussar Regiment, 6th Hussar Regiment and 9th Mounted Chasseur Regiment. Its dolman was now black and it was nicknamed the Hussards Noirs or Black Hussars, a name it held until the proclamation of the Second French Empire. On 4 May 1856 it was disbanded. =Régiment des Guides= Meanwhile, in 1852, the Régiment des Guides was formed. On 1 May 1854 this became the régiment des guides de la Garde Impériale, then in 1871 a new 9th Hussar Regiment. =World War I= Insignia of the 9th Hussars The 9th Hussars were mobilized on 2 August 1914, commanded by Colonel Burette. The regiment was positioned between 14th and 21st Corps, fighting in the Battle of the Frontiers. On 19 September, the regiment was transported by rail to the Somme where it faced the 21st Prussian Corps. The 9th Hussars became part of the 1st Cavalry Corps on 21 October and participated in the Race to the Sea. Brought back to Amiens in December, the 9th Hussars were in operations on the Somme until August 1916. On 6 August 1916, the regiment was relocated to take part in the Second Battle of Champagne, as part of 14th Corps. The 9th Hussars attacked on 26 September, suffering heavy losses. After the offensive, the regiment was moved to Montbéliard. In response to the German attacks at Verdun, the regiment was transferred to the Meuse on 29 February 1916. In December 1917, the regiment was moved to the Somme again and left on 28 May for the Chemin des Dames. The regiment took part in the Battle of Malmaison from 16 August to 23 October. In November, the 9th Hussars were withdrawn and stationed in Villiers-Cotterets. In January 1918, the regiment moved to Alsace. As part of 14th Corps, the 9th Hussars retreated to the Somme after the Spring Offensive in early April. The regiment participated in the Fifth Battle of Ypres in the last months of the war. The regiment was disbanded in 1922 at Chambéry, where it was then on garrison duties. =World War II and the Cold War= It was briefly re-formed in 1944, before being permanently re-created on 20 May 1956 at Sissonne to fight in Oranie. In 1962 it served as the garrison at Reims, before being disbanded on 1 June 1964, becoming the 18th Dragoon Regiment as the Reims garrison. On 1 July 1964 it was recreated for the Algerian War before being finally disbanded in 1979.

In 2010 the park was approved as a venue for civil marriage ceremonies and the first exchange of vows took place in August 2010. In 2014, Outdoor Recreation NI produced a report called 'Options to enhance access with the creation of a natural heritage trail between Ballygally Village and Carnfunnock Country Park' highlighting the parks close links to Ballygally. =Carnfunnock Maze= The maze is based on the winning idea from a 1985 Design a Maze competition: a hedge maze in the shape of Northern Ireland. It has numerous paths and dead ends with seven central spaces, one for each county and one for Lough Neagh. The maze was planted out in 1986 with over 1,500 mature hornbeam (Carpinus Betulus). By 1991 it was well established for its official opening marking Northern Ireland's contribution to the International Year of the Maze. History The presence of antiquities such as shell middens and Droagh motte show that there has been human habitation within this area going back hundreds of years. However it was not until 1823 that the Agnew family obtained the lease to this fertile land from the Marquess of Donegall and began farming in the area. The construction of the Coast Road (1832–1842) allowed two gentleman's residences to be built. One house was called 'Cairncastle Lodge' (now known as Carnfunnock) and the other was named 'Seaview' (now known as Cairndhu). By 1865 Mr. James Agnew had fallen into financial difficulties and sold Cairncastle Lodge to the Chaine family. The Chaines lived here for over 70 years and were successful linen manufacturers who were responsible for the development of Larne Harbour. In 1878 'Seaview' was sold to Mr. Stewart-Clark, a wealthy Scottish textile industrialist, who had married a local girl, Miss Annie Smiley and required an Irish residence. The Stewart-Clarks lived both here and in Scotland. Their daughter, Miss Edith Clark married Sir Thomas Dixon in 1906 and the Dixon family took ownership of Seaview in 1918. When Cairncastle Lodge's last owner, Mr. William Chaine, died in 1937 leaving no children, the land was sold and merged with Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon's property. By that time Cairncastle Lodge was in poor condition and had to be demolished. The land was separated again in 1947 when the Dixon family generously donated Cairndhu to the Ministry of Health and Local Government. It opened as a hospital in 1950 and provided care for nearly 35 years. It is now in private ownership with a planning application submitted to turn the property into private accommodation. At the same time, the Dixons held onto the Carnfunnock land and built a chalet bungalow where Cairncastle Lodge once stood. This gave them somewhere to stay whenever they visited the area. In 1957 Larne Borough Council purchased the 152 hectares of Carnfunnock land from Lady Dixon. This included the walled garden, chalet (which subsequently became the Larne Lions Club Holiday Home and was demolished in May 2015) and original estate features including the ice house and lime kilns. Over the years the former Council (Larne Borough Council) developed this land with unique attractions, thanks to the assistance of various funding bodies and it was officially opened as a country park by the Duchess of Kent in July 1990. For a full comprehensive history of both the Cairncastle Lodge and Cairndhu estates, including their associated owners a history guide can be downloaded from the Carnfunnock website.

Built in 1865, she was the first ship so named. Fortune was classified as YT-11 on 17 July 1920. Through her lengthy career, she served as a harbor tug, fireboat, cargo transport, training ship, and submarine tender, among other duties. She was launched on 25 March 1865 by James Tetlow of Boston, Massachusetts, and commissioned on 19 May 1871 with Mate (Warrant Officer) L. G. Cook in command. During her first period of commission, which lasted until 1 January 1873, Fortune was assigned to towing and freight transport services along the east coast of the United States. She then lay at Washington Navy Yard until being recommissioned on 1 June 1873. During the next 3 years, she trained cadet engineers of the Naval Academy, cruised in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico on survey duty and drills, and carried men from the east coast to New Orleans, as well as serving on harbor duty at many ports. On 11 May 1874, while off Veracruz, Mexico, one of her boats was capsized in a strong gale and four crewmen drowned. For his actions during the incident, Quartermaster Christopher Fowler was awarded the Medal of Honor. Fortune was again out of commission between 23 June 1876 and 21 September 1877, at Washington. Again in commission until 7 June 1879, Fortune sailed out of the Norfolk Navy Yard, carrying cargo to Washington, on harbor duty, and occasionally serving as an icebreaker. On 7 May 1882 at Hampton Roads, Virginia, Ordinary Seaman Johannes Rouning and Seaman Christian Osepins jumped overboard and rescued a fellow sailor from drowning, for which they were awarded the Medal of Honor. Fortune was recommissioned on 30 March 1887 to carry cargo between ships and stations along the east coast until being decommissioned at Newport, Rhode Island, on 22 April 1891. She returned to commission from 15 December 1899 to 6 June 1901 to serve as a gunnery training vessel for naval apprentices at Newport, and as a gunnery tug out of Newport, New York, and Boston. Again recommissioned on 23 October 1902, Fortune sailed to join the South Atlantic Squadron for operations around Puerto Rico, and on 20 May 1903, reached San Diego, California, for duty with the Pacific Squadron, sailing out of Bremerton, Washington, through the summer. On 2 August she arrived at Mare Island to serve as a submarine tender, joining in target practice and other fleet operations until going out of commission 10 April 1907. In commission from 22 January 1908 to 29 May 1909, and again from 9 June 1909 until placed in reserve on 28 June 1912, Fortune continued her work with submarines. Placed in full commission for the last time 22 May 1915, she served as a station ship at Tutuila, American Samoa, using Pearl Harbor as her home yard, until being decommissioned at Tutuila on 7 May 1922. She was sold on 22 May of that year.

() was a religious movement founded in Austria by the Pan- German politician Georg Ritter von Schönerer aimed at conversion of all the Roman Catholic German-speaking population of Austria to Lutheran Protestantism, or, in some cases, to the Old Catholic Churches.The science of the swastika, Bernard Thomas Mees. It was founded amid the ensuing Kulturkampf in Imperial Germany.  Origins  “Away from Rome” (German: \\"Los-von-Rom- Bewegung) was a religious movement founded in Austria around 1900, mostly politically influenced. This movement aimed at supporting change of confession from the Roman Catholic to either the Evangelical Lutheran or Old Catholic denomination. It was supported by German National forces. The slogan “Away from Rome” was coined by Theodor Georg Rakus, a medical student (who would later become Dr. Theodor Georg Rakus, physician and royal Swedish vice consul in Salzburg), and a companion of Georg von Schönerer.  Background: Greater German and German national ideas  Since the time of Counterreformation among the Habsburgs, Austria was an almost exclusively Roman Catholic country. The Protestants only formed a vanishing minority. Only since emperor Joseph II’s enactment of the Patent of Tolerance in 1781, the exercise of religion was granted again to Reformed Christians and Lutherans. After the foundation of the German Reich in 1871, causing the “lesser German solution”, that is the unification of Germany under the control of Prussia excluding Austria, many Austrians still remained devoted to “Greater German ideas”. The German Nationals strived for a close political connection to the German Reich, and partially even aimed at complete dissolution of the monarchy of the Habsburgs and the annexation of the parts that were populated by the Germans to the German Reich. One of the leading advocates of this political direction was Georg Ritter von Schönerer. In the program of Linz in 1882, the German Nationals established the slogan “not liberal, not clerical, but national”, and opposed to the Jews, as well as to the political and societal influence of the Roman Catholic Church.  Starting point: Count Badeni's language decrees  In 1897, the Language decrees issued by Prime Minister Count Badeni were enacted. The decrees ordered that civil servants of the crown lands Bohemia and Moravia should always be able to speak both German and Czech. These decrees were vehemently opposed by a group of German nationalists („Deutschnationale“), but were largely supported by the Austrian Catholic People’s Party („Katholische Volkspartei“) as well as by many Czech Catholic clerics. In reaction, the Nationalists promoted an oppositional movement that called for secession from Catholicism and resistance to its \\"alien\\" influence. (Schönerer’s slogan „Ohne Juda, ohne Rom wird gebaut Germanias Dom“ (“Without Jewry, without Rome, Germania’s cathedral will be built”) demonstrates a typical conflation of anti-Catholicism with xenophobia.) In a congregation of German nationalists in Vienna, the so-called “German National Congress” („Deutscher Volkstag“), the nationalists called on the people to leave the Catholic Church and Schönerer and a group of followers coined the slogan “Away from Rome!” („Los von Rom!“). The conversion movement was supported by Protestant organizations from Germany, especially by the “Gustavus Adolphus Association” („Gustav-Adolf-Verein“) and the Protestant Federation („Evangelischer Bund“) until 1905. Between January 1898 and March 1900 10,000 Austrians left the Catholic Church. More than 65,000 people joining the Protestant Church and more than 20,000 people joining the Old Catholic Church before the outbreak of World War I in 1914 were registered. As a result, many new Protestant rectories had to be installed. Nevertheless, not all conversions can be seen as a result of the “Away from Rome” movement; many of them were due to a general dissatisfaction with the Roman Catholic Church, which was largely viewed as anti-liberal and anti-progressive. The Catholic Church was at first hesitant to react, but from 1902 onward, big press campaigns were undertaken and administrative measures enacted in order to slow down the conversion movement. As a result from the “Away from Rome” movement, the Protestant churches in Austria fell to an extent under the influence of German nationalists. Many Austrian Protestants had already been affected by the Protestant Prussian dominated German Empire („Deutsches Reich“), and the identification of German Protestantism with German Nationalism (as opposed to the relatively pluralistic policy of the Catholic Habsburg monarchy) tended to make this tendency even stronger.

The members of SS units were German Allgemeine-SS members appointed in Bohemia Moravia and Germans born in CSR. The main purpose was propaganda duties and recruiting for the Waffen-SS. The Oberabschnitt had been formed strictly as a General-SS counterpart to the much more powerful position of Higher SS and Police Leader of Moravia and both positions were intended to be held by the same person.

The Oberabschnitt headquarters was established in the city of Prague. The Oberabschnitt's sole commander was Karl Hermann Frank who was already holding several high positions in the Nazi government of Czechoslovakia.

The party was led by Carlos Palenque. Goals CONDEPA was founded in Tiwanaku on September 21, 1988. The party was primarily based in the La Paz Department. CONDEPA was the first major party in Bolivia that appealed to the cultural identity of the Aymaras, the indigenous majority of the country. It borrowed katarista symbols and used the wiphala flag. p. 84 Palenque often used references to Aymara culture in his campaigns. Election history The party won strong support amongst urban poor, amongst Aymaras that had migrated to the urban centres. CONDEPA lost the mayoral post of La Paz in 1995. At the time of the 1999 elections the CONDEPA was a party in crisis. p. 406 It was discredited by having entered into Hugo Banzer's government. The party had suffered the death of its leader Carlos Palenque, and divisions had erupted amongst his successors. Moreover, the influence of the mass media connected to the party had decreased significantly. As the party lost the municipal contest in El Alto in these elections, it lost its last remaining political stronghold in the country. p. 93 Ahead of the 2002 general election, CONDEPA launched Nicolás Valdivia as its presidential candidate and Esperanza Huanca as vice-presidential candidate. CONDEPA lost all of its 22 seats in the Congress of Bolivia in the elections. The implosion of CONDEPA enabled the nascent Movement for Socialism to gain a wide following amongst indigenous urban poor. CONDEPA-Patriotic Movement lost its registration at the National Electoral Court shortly after the 2002 election.

It was named for the prominent Creek Indian chief William McIntosh, a leader of the Lower Towns. He helped improve it in the early 19th century, to connect Creek towns in what are now two states. The original McIntosh Road, also called, in Alabama, the \\"Georgia Road\\", led from Kymulga Ferry near Childersburg, Alabama to Talladega, Alabama northeasterly, then traveling along the south side of the Choccolocco Valley and crossing the ridge containing Cheaha Mountain at a pass some miles north. It travels through the area of modern Hollis Crossroads and crosses the Tallapoosa River at an Okfuskee village, continuing in a southeasterly direction to the Chattahoochee River near modern Whitesburg, Georgia in Carroll County. The road continues today along its original axis in Talladega and Calhoun counties in Alabama, and the original track virtually disappears as it enters the mountains of Cleburne County. The eastern terminus was at McIntosh's Ferry, which he operated on the Chattahoochee River near his plantation, known as \\"Lochau\\" or \\"Lockchau Talofau\\" on Acorn Bluff. Today McIntosh Reserve Park in Carroll County, Georgia preserves some of the McIntosh plantation and his burial site near his former home, at the eastern end of what was once McIntosh Road. McIntosh was executed at his plantation on April 30, 1825, by Law Defenders on order of the Creek National Council, for having signed the Treaty of Indian Springs of 1825 and ceded much of the communal Creek lands in Georgia and Alabama to the United States. This road was perhaps north of the Federal Road from Washington, D.C. through Georgia, to New Orleans, Louisiana. President Thomas Jefferson discussed the benefits of providing provisions and lodging for travelers with McIntosh during a meeting November 2, 1805. McIntosh built a modest hotel along the road.Benjamin W. Griffith, McIntosh and Weatherford, Creek Indian Leaders (University of Alabama Press, 1998) (Page 60) This route is also called the McIntosh Trail. In the early 21st century, the McIntosh Trail Historic Preservation Society in Georgia has been working to have that portion in Georgia designated as a scenic byway by the state department of transportation. The route begins at Indian Springs and travels through Coweta, Butts, Spalding, Fayette, and Carroll counties, and through downtown Newnan, Sharpsburg, and Senoia.Jeff Bishop, \\"McIntosh Trail scenic byway project moving along quickly\\" , Times-Herald, 27 April 2009, accessed 19 November 2014 By 2011, the alignment of the route had gained preliminary approval.\\"McIntosh Trail to become scenic byway\\", Trail of the Trail, March 2011, accessed 20 November 2014 During the last months of the American Civil War, Union regiments under General John T. Croxton used the route to invade Georgia in April 1865. The road in Alabama can be followed by U.S. Route 431 (US 431), Alabama State Route 21 (SR 21), Talladega County Route 180 (CR 180), and Talladega CR 240, paralleling the Norfolk Southern Railway tracks to the Kymulga Mill And Covered Bridge.

Retrieved Aug. 6, 2010. The PFW was staff-owned and published by a collective that called itself \\"The Commune.\\" An editorial published in the May 26, 1972 issue under the heading \\"Our Rap\\" gives the paper's statement of purpose: The two titles Grok and Fair Witness are both references to the novel Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert A. Heinlein, a popular touchstone of the 1960s hippie counterculture. To \\"grok\\" is a form of deep holistic comprehension of any thing or situation (similar to hippie/beatnik slang \\"dig\\"); while a \\"Fair Witness\\" is a (fictional) service provided by a sort of hired court reporter with an eidetic memory who serves as a totally honest bonded eyewitness at any proceeding. Contents of the Fair Witness were the usual 1960s underground press mix of underground comix (some originating locally in the Fair Witness; others like Crumb, Bode, etc. distributed nationally through the Alternative Features Syndicate), film, music, and book reviews, coverage of drugs, the occult, New Left and antiwar political activism, the Women's Liberation movement, ecology, etc.; along with local advertising and event and switchboard listings. It was a member of the Underground Press Syndicate and the Liberation News Service. A typical tabloid sized issue ran to about 24 pages and sold for 25 cents. The Fair Witness was distributed throughout the western Pennsylvania area and locally through a network of about a hundred local shops (head shops, co-ops, record stores, boutiques, book stores, natural food stores, etc.) and was sold on the street by hawkers who kept a dime for every 25 cent copy they sold, picking up bundles for street distribution at The Free People's Store, a co-op on Meyron Avenue in the city's Oakland neighborhood.

Each Peace Palace is built using standardized plans compatible with Maharishi Sthapatya Veda design principles. In 2000, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi announced his aspiration to build thousands of Peace Palaces around the world. Proposed locations in the United States have included the cities of Atlanta, Denver, New York City, Minneapolis, Long Island, Colorado Springs, Los Angeles, Charlottesville, Pittsburgh, Boston, Tulsa, and San Francisco. In addition, construction has been proposed for Ottawa, Ontario and Montreal, Quebec in Canada; Auckland, New Zealand, and the cities of Birmingham, Coventry, Glasgow, Newcastle, Sunderland, Rendlesham and Middlesbrough in the UK. As of 2007, 52 parcels had been acquired by the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) and construction was planned via tax-free bonds obtained through the Colorado Health Facilities Authority as well as private investors. As of 2013, eight peace palaces have been completed in the United States. Planning, design and reception In 2000, the Maharishi announced his aspirations to build one or more Peace Palaces in each of the 3,000 largest cities around the world. A 2006 prospectus for the TM movement's Raam bond specified 5,000 peace palaces worldwide. Another plan called for 2,400 buildings but was later reduced to 100 or 200 in the USA and 14 in Canada. \\"Maharishi Peace Palace\\" is described as a \\"pre-engineered\\", MSV-designed building. Plans are available for four sizes, the \\"medium\\" option being a , two-story building with a white, painted or marble-clad exterior. Depending on its size and other factors, a peace palace might include a spa facility, dormitory, meditation room, lecture hall, meeting room, a Maharishi Ayurveda shop, and a library. The peace palaces are intended to replace rental properties currently housing the TM movement's teaching centers, retail outlets, and spas. They have been called \\"Maharishi Enlightment Centers\\" or \\"Maharishi Invincibility Centers\\" or \\"Peace Palaces\\". Some could be connected with organic farming operations, either on-site or at nearby rural locations. Film director and TM advocate David Lynch said a Peace Palace is a \\"peace factory\\" rather than a \\"pretty building\\". An article in The New York Times described a peace palace as \\"an Indian temple crossed with a Southern plantation mansion\\" with their consistent appearance being part of a branding effort. Critics claim that the plan is aimed at increasing the Maharishi's financial assets, and doubt that the hundreds or thousands of proposed Palaces would be built. while a possible lack of interest in the Peace Palaces might be attributed to the Maharishi's death. A spokesman at the Maharishi's funeral in 2008 said that the construction of peace palaces would remain a top priority. Financing and construction In 2007, The New York Times reported that 52 parcels had been acquired for Peace Palaces. They are being built in the US by the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) and overseen by the Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation (MVEDC), as well as by private partners. David Lynch initiated an effort in 2003 to raise $1 billion for palace construction. In 2007, the GCWP applied to the Colorado Health Facilities Authority, a private group that serves as a vehicle for financing construction by non-profit healthcare institutions, for an issue of $55 million in tax-exempt bonds to finance construction of Peace Palaces in 21 cities, and the purchase of an organic farm in Goshen, New York. The GCWP would be responsible for the debt and interest. In order to get IRS approval for the tax-exempt bond, the GCWP had to get endorsements from the city councils or state authorities of the jurisdictions where it planned to build. A 2008 report states that $40 million was borrowed to build nine Peace Palaces, and was secured with $250 million in real estate assets. Those who finance the construction of Peace Palaces are called \\"Founders of World Peace\\". In at least some cases, the Palaces are intended to run on a for- profit basis with returns going to investors. Two or three Palaces have been built by private individuals.

The building will replace a center in Badingham that was used for 25 years. According to a 2013 report in British news service, fundraising is underway and construction is expected to begin at year end. Additional peace palaces have been proposed for Birmingham, Coventry, Glasgow, Newcastle, Sunderland, Rendlesham and Middlesbrough in the UK. =Other countries= In addition, peace palaces have been proposed for Ottawa, Ontario, Montreal, Teufelsberg in Germany and Auckland, New Zealand.

A rigid chain actuator, known variously as a linear chain actuator, push-pull chain actuator, electric chain actuator or column- forming chain actuator, is a specialized mechanical linear actuator used in window operating, push-pull material handling and lift applications. The actuator is a chain and pinion device that forms an articulated telescoping member to transmit traction and thrust. High-capacity rigid chain lifting columns (jacks) can move dynamic loads exceeding 10 tonnes (US 20,000 pounds) over more than 7 metres (20 feet) of travel.Serapid lifting column brochure: http://serapid.us/PDF/Linear-Tele-Lifting-Col.pdf Principle of operation Rigid chain actuators function as rack and pinion linear actuators that use articulated racks. Rigid chain actuators use limited-articulation chains, usually resembling a roller chain, that engage with pinions mounted on a drive shaft within a housing. The links of the actuating member, the “rigid chain”, are articulated in a manner that they deflect from a straight line to one side only. As the pinions spin, the links of the chain are rotated 90 degrees through the housing, which guides and locks the chain into a rigid linear form effective at resisting tension and compression (buckling). Because the actuating member can fold on itself, it can be stored relatively compactly in a storage magazine, either in an overlapping or coiled arrangement. Rigid chain actuators are generally driven by electric motors. Most rigid chains are manufactured from steel. Use Patent Drawing for Interlocking Rigid Chain Actuator (1972). Modified roller chain has been used extensively in material handling equipment, but could only be used in push-pull applications when a continuous loop of chain was used (with the exception of chain encapsulated in a guide channel). The development of efficient rigid chain actuators broadened the use of chain actuation for industrial applications. Small scale rigid chain actuators are used as building hardware, incorporated into windows, door and hatches as motorized open/close mechanisms.Teleflex window chain openers: Rigid chain actuators are also used as the lifting columns in performing arts facilities, incorporated in stage, orchestra and seating platform lift systems. Increasingly rigid chain systems are being incorporated into scissor lift tables or platform lifts as the method of actuation, replacing hydraulic cylinders. They are also used for production line automation and die changing. The autoloaders used in Soviet/Russian tanks such as the T-64, T-80, T-72 and T-90 use rigid chain systems to push the two-part ammunition (projectile and propellant) into the tank's gun. Types The primary distinction between types of rigid chain actuator is whether the actuating member is formed from a single chain or from a pair of interlocking chains in a back-to-back arrangement, like a zipper. Interlocking chain actuators have the advantages over single-chain actuators of improved resistance to buckling and that the actuating member does not require lateral restraint at its leading end in order to resist a modicum of transverse loads on any edge of the member. For example, it may function as a relatively stable telescoping pole. The design of the chain varies significantly depending on application and manufacturer. Variants have been designed to, among other things: * Simplify manufacture * Reduce friction and maintenance * Limit size and weight * Increase speed, travel, capacity, efficiency and stability Development Patent Drawing for Chain Rammer (1908) Rigid chain actuators were developed from “chain rammers” that used a single “ram chain” thrust from a magazine to load heavy-caliber ordnance into the breech of a cannon. Robert Matthews received a US patent for his “Mechanical Rammer” in 1901 which used a roller on the leading end of the chain to guide it and allow thrust without deflection. Developed more than a century ago, his rammer still bears a strong resemblance to many modern rigid chain actuators. In 1908 Oscar Knoch was awarded a US patent for his “Chain Rammer for Guns”. By orienting the folding side of the chain upward his ram chain acted as a self-supporting telescoping beam with negligible sag. Used in this manner the need for a separate guide was eliminated. An early conception of chain used as a telescoping column instead a horizontal rammer was by Eldridge E. Long, who was awarded a US patent for his “Lifting Jack” in 1933, which he believed was “particularly adapted for use upon automobiles”. It used a double chain configuration, each chain linking solid bearing blocks that were stacked to resist compressive loads. In 1951, Yaichi Hayakawa was awarded a US patent for his “Interlocking Chain Stanchion” which eliminated bearing blocks by integrating the compressive path of force into the interlocking links of two roller-like chains. The zipper action of back-to-back interlocking chains provided guideless chain travel regardless of orientation and path of travel. In 1941, prior to the double chain configuration, Karl Bender received a US patent for \\"Compression Resistant Chain\\" using three interlocking chains. In addition to the back-to-back arrangement of the typical interlocking chain actuator, a third chain was interlocked between the other two at a right angle. Perhaps due to their relative complexity, triple- chain actuators are not common.

This edition of the Flying Broom International Women's Film Festival, which was founded in 1997 and is organized by Flying Broom with support from the Çankaya municipality in Ankara and accredited by FIPRESCI, had the theme of evil and focused on the problems of women (including prostitutes, migrant women, poor women and lesbians). The festival opened with a ceremony at the Ankara State Opera and Ballet Hall on May 6, 2010 at which honorary awards were presented to actresses Lale Belkıs and Gülsen Tuncer, and art director Deniz Özen, who attended the special screening of Turkish classic Unmade Bed () directed by Atıf Yılmaz. Among those also in attendance at the ceremony were actresses Hale Soygazi and Deniz Türkali, director Biket İlhan, film critic Sevin Okyay, German director Almut Getto, and American director Nancy Schwartzman. More than 100 films were screened in 13 programmes at the Kızılırmak cinema, the Ankara Goethe Institute and the Ankara University communication faculty during the festival. A short film competition also under the theme evil, whose winners were to be announced at the opening gala, and a program titled The Other History, dedicated to ignored identities, and featuring four recent Turkish documentaries focusing on identities that have been subjected to 'evil' by being deliberately alienated and ignored were new features of this edition. The festival closed with an award ceremony and screening of the winning film at the Kızılırmak cinema on May 13, 2010, at which the FIPRESCI jury, consisting of Ceylan Özçelik, Dominique Martinez and Kirsten Liese, awarded the festivals top prize to Home directed by Ursula Meier, and bestowed the Young Witch Award upon Damla Sönmez.

The EIO would replace the existing legal framework applicable to the gathering and transfer of evidence between the member states. It proposed a procedure that would allow an authority in one member state (the \\"issuing authority\\") to request specific criminal investigative measures be carried out by an authority in another member state (the \\"executing authority\\"). The measure is based on the principle of mutual recognition established in article 82(1) of the TFEU. Article 82(1) stipulates that judicial cooperation in criminal matters within the European Union shall be based upon the mutual recognition of judgements and judicial decisions. Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union 2012/C 326/01, Art 82(1) The EIO contained several significant innovations over existing procedures. The EIO focuses on the investigative measure to be executed, rather than on the type of evidence to be gathered. The EIO has a broad scope – all investigative measures are covered, except those explicitly excluded. In principle, the issuing authority decides on the type of investigative measure to be used. However, flexibility is introduced by allowing, in a limited number of cases, the executing authority to decide to have recourse to an investigative measure other than that provided for in the EIO. Clear time limits are provided for the recognition and, with more flexibility, for the execution of the EIO. The proposal also innovates by providing the legal obligation to execute the EIO with the same celerity and priority as for a similar national case. The EIO provides for the use of a form that should be used in all cases. Compared to the European Evidence Warrant and to Mutual Legal Assistance, the EIO provides for rationalisation of the grounds for refusal, and the right of the issuing authority to request that one or several of its officials assist in the execution of the measure in the executing State. In August 2010 the European Commission issued an opinion on the initiative, warning that it may be a system of evidence sharing without the safeguards provided by common admissibility standards. In its opinion, the European Commission noted the advantages of the proposal – a simpler, unified system – if the system was backed by the appropriate procedural and fundamental rights standards. At the time of the adoption of the opinion, Viviane Reding, the EU Justice Commissioner said that she would \\"ensure that the proposal respects the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.\\" A general approach on the draft text was reached at the meeting of the Council in December 2011,http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/jha/126932.pdf allowing the Council to negotiate with the European Parliament for the adoption of the measure. The rapporteur in the European Parliament is Nuno Melohttp://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96978/Nuno_MELO.html of the European People's Party. Before the approval of the EIO could be considered by the European Parliament and EU Council, it was criticised by Fair Trials International, the Fundamental Rights Agency, Statewatch and some UK parliamentarians, who fear that it will allow increased police surveillance and disproportionate use of investigative powers in trivial matters. The directive was adopted in 2014. When may an EIO be issued? The EIO may be issued in relation to four types of proceedings. The first is in relation to criminal proceedings by a judicial authority pertaining to a criminal offense under the national law of the state issuing the EIO. The second and third is with regards to proceedings brought by administrative authorities or judicial authorities for acts punishable under the national law of the state issuing the EIO where the infringement gives rise to proceedings in front of a court having jurisdiction in criminal matters. Lastly, an EIO can be issued in relation to the first three types of proceedings which relate to offences or infringements where a legal person can be held liable and punished in the issuing state.DIRECTIVE 2014/41/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 3 April 2014 regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal matters, art 4 Challenges faced by the implementation of the EIO: The inception of the EIO had led to somewhat of an uproar in the academic and legal communities. There has been some staple critique that the EIO is a prosecutorial instrument that does not afford a high standard of protection to human rights. Some even went as far as arguing that the EIO’s inception was hasty, as it did not allow for experiences to be drawn from the European Arrest Warrant, and some said it was a patchwork solution in a fragmented frame of mutual recognition. The main rule under article 21(1) is that the executing state shall bear all the costs of carrying out an EIO for the issuing state. The underlying rationale is that costs operate based on a principle of reciprocity. However, certain countries are in a position where they execute much more EIOs than they issue, and certain countries may be tasked with carrying out a large scope investigation. Article 21(2) only suggest that Member States may consult how to share the costs or modify the EIO if the former is exceptionally high. There are some human rights challenges as well. Article 1(3) of the directive stipulates that the issuing of an EIO may be requested by a suspect, accused or a lawyer on his behalf. However, not all Member States have implemented the directive to allow suspects/accused/their lawyers to request the issuing of an EIO for evidence in another country. This raises a challenge against the equality of arms which is guaranteed by the European Convention of Human Rights as a component of a fair trial. Article 4 of the Directive stipulates the type of proceedings for which an EIO could be issued, which includes administrative proceedings. This is problematic with regards to the rule of speciality, as an issuing state may request evidence for an administrative offense in the executing country but use it for criminal proceedings. The grounds of non-recognition or non- execution in Article 10 of the directive are limited and not mandatory, as an executing state may refuse them. This applies to the ne bis in idem rule among other things. The Rationale for Creating the EIO: In considering the European Investigation Order it is important to examine why it exists and the rationale for adding yet another investigative measure to the existing cross-border investigative measures. Prior to the EIO there was Council Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA and this pertained to the mutual recognition of freezing orders for the purpose of securing evidence or subsequent confiscation of property.Council Framework Decision 2003/577/JHA, Art 3 The issue with this framework decision however, was that there would need to be a separate request for the transferring of evidence to the issuing state.DIRECTIVE 2014/41/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 3 April 2014 regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal matters, para 3 There was also Council Framework Decision 2008/978/JHA which pertained to the European Evidence Warrant. This instrument allowed for the mutual recognition of judicial orders issued for the sake of obtaining objects, documents and data in order for them to be used in criminal proceedings.Council Framework Decision 2008/978/JHA, Art 1 The issue with this measure was that it only applied to already existing evidence and thus had a limited scope, outside of which the only measure available was the Mutual Legal Assistance Procedure.DIRECTIVE 2014/41/EU OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 3 April 2014 regarding the European Investigation Order in criminal matters, para 4 The result of these framework decisions was that the framework for collecting evidence was fragmented and complex. This fragmentation was discussed at the Stockholm Program by the European Council in 2009 where it was decided that there needed to be a comprehensive system based on mutual recognition for obtaining evidence in cross-border criminal cases. The answer to this fragmentation was thus the EIO.Council of the European Union, The Stockholm Programme – An open and secure Europe serving and protecting the citizens, 2 December 2009, pg 4, 21-23 See also *European Arrest Warrant References Category:European Union directives Category:Criminal procedure ","title":"European Investigation Order"},{"id":"28271868","text":"Juan Diego González Alzate (22 September 1980 – circa 27 February 2020) was a Colombian footballer.

The film is based on Dematra's novel by the same name. Both the book and the film are a fictionalized account of the childhood of Barack Obama, the 44th President of the United States, who lived in Indonesia from 1967 to 1971. Plot Barack \\"Barry\\" Obama (Hasan Al Farouq) moves with his mother Ann Dunham (Cara Lachelle) and stepfather Lolo Soetoro (Radhit Syam) from Menteng to another suburb in Jakarta, Indonesia. Barry befriends two neighborhood children, Slamet (Angga Putra) and Yuniardi, by playing ping pong. He makes more friends at his school. Although his Indonesian is fluent, the other children find Barry strange (\\"aneh\\") because of his long nose, curly hair, and black skin. Most can overcome this difference, but the local bully Carut (Yehuda Rumbindi) confronts Obama. The two, and their groups of friends, fight. Barry returns home with a bruised face. Lolo teaches Barry to box with the help of the effeminate, cross-dressing manservant Turdi (Teuku Zacky). Ann, however, dislikes violence and begins to consider Indonesia a poor place to raise her son. When Barry is playing marbles with his friends, Carut comes with his gang and disrupts the game. In the resulting brawl, Barry punches Carut and pushes his face in the wet mud, humiliating the bully. As Lolo and Turdi praise Barry, Ann tells him that he should apologize to Carut. This advice, which Barry and Lolo reject, leads to a series of fights between Barry's parents. Carut then challenges Barry and his friends to a game of soccer, with a cash prize for the winners. Lolo and Turdi begin training the boys so that they can win; Turdi also teaches the girls how to be cheerleaders. As the game approaches, Barry cuts his leg on a barbed wire fence and is rushed to the local clinic, where the nurses and doctors are unwilling to treat him unless he waits in the long line for his turn. Disgusted, she calls her father in Hawaii and tells him they will be sending Barry there, hoping to give him a better chance for success. On the day of the game, Barry has trouble running but is able to lead his team to victory. After seeing Carut's disappointment, Barry and his team talk to the bully and give him the prize money. Barry further apologizes to him, and the two groups are able to be friends. When Barry returns home, his mother tells him that he will be returning to Hawaii to live with his grandparents. Although devastated, Barry listens. His only regret before leaving is being unable to say goodbye to Slamet. Twenty-six years later, Barry is inaugurated as President of the United States. Slamet watches on television, recalling his childhood with the new president.  Production  Originally planned for 2011, principle filming began the week of May 10, 2010 in the west Java city of Bandung, in Cimahi, West Java, about 110 miles (180 kilometers) southeast of Jakarta. The Bandung location was chosen due to its resemblance to the upscale Menteng neighborhood where Obama had grown up in the 1970s. The film's script was written in three to four weeks and underwent four revisions before it was finalized. It was shot over a period of 25 days, being \\"rushed\\" through production in order to be ready for a screening on June 17, 2010, set to coincide with President Obama's planned state visit to Indonesia. Upon cancellation of Obama's visit, the film premier was rescheduled to July 1, 2010. Director Dematra is quoted as stating that the film is \\"60 percent fact and 40 percent fiction\\". \\"This is not so much a movie about Barack Obama, but rather about a 10-year-old African-American kid who landed in Indonesia for the first time, and who was going to be confronted with racism, difference and pluralism. And it is this confrontation that may have helped him to become the president of the United States.\\" \\"It's about his friendships, his hobbies, just a childhood story,\\" said Dematra. \\"It's not about politics, it's just the story of a boy.\\" The 100-minute bilingual film was scheduled for release in 60 main theaters nationwide. Multivision Plus Pictures, one of Indonesia's largest film companies, is the production company and distributor. They may seek international release depending on demand, and negotiations are underway for a screening in the United States.  Reception  The premiere in Jakarta was attended by Indonesian-known actors, celebrities, political leaders, and U.S. Ambassador Cameron Hume. Viewers made note that the film was less a historical re-enactment, and more simply a story of a young boy growing up in a strange neighborhood and adapting to a new culture. The Jakarta Globe reported that Seto Mulyadi, the chairman of the National Commission for Child Protection, said \\"This movie could definitely be an inspiration for children in Indonesia about how amazing the power of dreams are.\\" Commentator Wimar Witoelar wrote that \\"The film doesn't show the sensitivities of his adjustment as well as Obama's book Dreams From My Father. But for those not familiar with the Obama story, it offers a decent impression of his trials and tribulations and ultimate victory. Many inaccuracies make the movie a rich target for those who concentrate on detail, which could have been avoided had the producers not aimed for a deadline set by President Obama's June visit, which was cancelled at the last minute.\\" Dan Abramson of Huffington Post compared the film's trailer to The Karate Kid films. The Week wrote that Little Obama \\"promises to shed new light on the young \\"Barry\\" Obama.\\"  Cast  Hasan Faruq Ali, a 14-year-old American, plays the role of young Barry Obama. Ali was born in Questa, New Mexico, to musicians Shakur Ali and Naseem Nahid, both members of a Sufi Muslim band. South African-born actress Cara Lachelle portrays Obama's mother Ann Dunham, while Indonesian actor Eko Noah portrays stepfather Lolo Soetoro.  The novel  Book cover Dematra interviewed 30 people prior to writing the novel, Obama Anak Menteng (literally Obama, the Menteng Kid) , which he completed in just four days after one month of research. The novel was published in March 2010 by Gramedia, and had its official launch at Obama's former school, State Elementary School Menteng 01, on March 15, 2010. The novel received some criticism for its portrayal of Obama reciting the Qur'an and praying towards Mecca. When interviewed, director Dematra emphasized that while the scenes are true, the story is not about Obama praying, and he had not decided whether the scene would appear in the film adaptation. It subsequently developed that the scene did not make it into the film, having been dropped as being deemed \\"too political\\". The director stated, \\"That scene wasn't shot because I didn't want people to take it out of context and use it against him\\".

The project will lead to M8, a spacecraft, that will be used to explore space. The atmosphere at the laboratory is competitive rather than co-operative, with fierce rivalry between the various scientists. The project leader Michael Heathley (James Donald) is so wrapped up with the M7 that his wife Lydia (Phyllis Calvert) feels neglected and that she is being sidelined in favour of her husband's work. At a social gathering she strikes up a conversation with Heathley's colleague Alex Leon (Herbert Lom), and the pair are soon circling one another. Meanwhile, Heathley is desperate to test the M7, but is continually stonewalled by facility director Carrington (Maurice Denham). Matters take a sinister turn when Carrington is killed, and the project members realise there is a spy in their midst. The M7 is finally given its first tense test flight, and emerges intact. The group continue to work on modifications to iron out minor problems identified on the test flight. The finished version then takes to the sky, but this time the spy shows his hand and tries to hijack the aircraft. As the spy reaches for a pistol which has fallen on the floor he stretches his air supply pipe to the point where it disconnects from the supply. He screams and collapses.

At one point, the aircraft is seen resting on water, giving it the potential of being a flying-boat. All the interiors of the M7 are studio- constructed mock-ups.

Legislative decisions are governed by rules and legislation regarding the state budget process. After the Legislature approves an appropriations bill, it is sent to the Governor, who may sign it into law, or may veto it. A vetoed bill is sent back to the Legislature, which can pass it into law with a two-thirds majority in each chamber. The Legislature may also combine all or some appropriations bills into an omnibus appropriations bill. In addition, the Governor may request and the Legislature may pass supplemental appropriations bills or emergency supplemental appropriations bills. Several government agencies provide budget data and analysis. These include the Oklahoma Office of State Finance, Oklahoma Tax Commission, the Office of the Oklahoma State Treasurer, and the Office of the Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector. Budget Process The budget cycle starts with state agencies developing a detailed outline of financial needs for the next fiscal year. This \\"budget request\\" is then reviewed and analyzed by Office of State Finance in light of overall state responsibilities, goals, objectives and total funds available. Each year by October 1, each state agency must submit their official budget request to the Office of State Finance. Budget requests can be amended once submitted, however. From October through December, the Office of State Finance analyzes each agency's request and develops recommendations to the agency based on the direction of the Governor. Beginning in December, the Oklahoma State Board of Equalization begins meetings. On the first Monday in February, the Governor must submit a balanced budget to the Legislature based on the Office of State Finance review of budget requests and subsequent recommendations by the Office of State Finance, the Governor's Cabinet Secretaries and policy advisors. Budgeted expenditures can not exceed the amount available for appropriation. Not more than 45 days nor less than 35 days prior to the convening of each regular session of the Legislature, the State Board of Equalization certifies amounts available for appropriation. A second meeting of the Board is held within five days of the monthly apportionment in February. At these two meetings mandated by the Oklahoma Constitution estimates of revenue to each available fund are based on a determination of the revenues to be received by the State under the laws in effect at the time such determination is made. These estimates are based on predictable changes in the economy as well as current law. Once certified, the amount may only be altered if the Legislature passes measures design to increase or reduce revenues. Should the Legislature enact laws that provide additional revenues or a reduction in revenues to these certified funds, the Board meets to determine the changes in revenue. Only those changes in revenue resulting from changes in law can be considered at this third meeting. Once the Legislature convenes in February, both the Oklahoma Senate's Appropriations Committee and the Oklahoma House of Representatives' Appropriations Committee begin meeting to review each agency's budget request. This continues until late-April. In May, the Appropriations Committees determines the agency budgets for the next fiscal year and then pass appropriations bills. By the end of May to early June, the Governor evaluates all appropriation bill passed by the Legislature and makes a final decision to approve, veto or line item veto the bills. The current fiscal year ends on June 30 and the recently enacted budget takes effect on July 1. A state agency, based upon funds appropriated by the Legislature and other funds available to the agency, then develops a Budget Work Program which outlines in detail planned expenditures for the ensuing fiscal year. Work programs are reviewed by OSF and the approved work program serves as a basis for the subsequent appropriations of funds. Budget Work Programs can be revised at any time during the fiscal year if justified and if the revision can be accomplished within various expenditure, full-time-equivalent employee and program expenditure limits. =Gubernatorial control= In addition to controlling the state agencies and submitting the proposed budget to the Legislature at the beginning of the budget process, the Governor also plays a significant role at the end of the budgetary process. Every appropriations bill passed by the Legislature, before it can become law, must be presented to the Governor for their approval, as is the case with all other types of bill. However, in addition to simply signing or rejecting, the Governor is given the power to veto specific items with appropriation bills and approve the remainder of the bill. Any item so vetoed is void unless both the Senate and the House of Representatives vote to override his veto by two-thirds majorities in both chambers. =Legislative control= Legislative budgetary control is maintained over the state agencies at the line item level as identified in appropriation acts. Agency budgets may be modified subject to statutory limits and subject to review by the Legislature's Joint Committee on the Budget and Program Oversight. The Director of OSF must approve all transfers between line-items up to 25 percent of the line item, unless either the Chair or Vice Chair of the Joint Committee, in writing, object to the transfer. If further transfers are deemed necessary, if the Director, Chair and Vice Chair all agree, an additional 15 percent (total 40 percent) may be transferred. All transfers are subject to review by the Joint Committee to determine if the transfer tends to effectuate or subvert the intention and objectives of the Legislature. Funding sources The three main sources of funding for State government operations are state appropriations, federal funds, and revolving funds. Revolving funds are generated from fees, dedicated financing, and other agency-generated funding. *Appropriations are annual authority from the Legislature to spend an amount of money for a particular purpose and receive the most attention from the Governor, Legislature and other groups as they represents discretionary spending *Federal funds are grants given by the United States federal government to support specific state services and agencies, with some requiring the State to match the federal funds with State appropriations and with all limit how the money may be used *Revolving funds are fees and other revenue collected by state agencies that are used to support the activities of the agency that collected them, often limited to specific purposes Appropriations account for less than half of total state spending. In some agencies, nearly all of their funding comes from appropriations while, in many others, appropriations make up less than half the total spending of the agency (e.g. the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety). Many agencies receive no appropriations at all and they are funded entirely by federal funds (e.g. the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission) or revolving funds (e.g. the Oklahoma State Banking Department). Major revenue categories For FY 2011, the state government is projected to collect approximately $5 billion in tax revenue, up 8.29% versus FY2010 revenues of $4.6 billion. Primary receipt categories included:FY 2010 Budget Data, Oklahoma Office of State Finance * Individual income taxes (1.7B or 34%) * Sales taxes (1.6B or 32%) * Gross production taxes (434M or 10%) * Corporate income taxes (172M or 3%) * Motor Vehicle taxes (145M or 3%) Other taxes include alcohol, motor vehicle, cigarette and tobacco taxes. Tax revenues have averaged approximately 5.8% to 6.5% of the State's gross domestic product.Oklahoma State Senate 2008 Report, Oklahoma Senate Major expenditure categories For FY 2013, the state government budgeted to spend nearly $6.8 billion on a budget, up 3% versus FY2012 spending of $6.6 billion. Primary expenditure categories include: *Appropriations by Cabinet Department: $6.8 billion (+3.2%) **$3.4 billion - Education (+0%) **$1.3 billion - Health (+8%) **$766 million - Human Services (+7%) **$665 million - Safety and Security (+0%) **$207 million - Transportation (+0%) **$109 million - Finance and Revenue (-7%)In 2011 the Legislature passed legislation dissolving the Human Resources and Administration Cabinet Department and transferred its duties and budget to the Finance Cabinet Department while demanding cost-savings resulting from the merger, resulting in an overall budget decrease. The decrease represents total change from the combined FY12 budgets for both Cabinet Departments. **$84.6 million - Judiciary (+0%) **$80.0 million - Commerce and Tourism (+0%) **$37.7 million - Agriculture (+7%) **$35.7 million - Veterans Affairs (+3%) **$32.7 million - Legislature (+7%) **$17.8 million - Science and Technology (+0%) **$14.8 million - Environment (+13%) **$12.1 million - Energy (+13%) **$10.7 million - Military (+5%) **$8.4 million - Secretary of State (+0%) **$2.7 million - Governor and Lieutenant Governor (+8%)FY 2013 Budget Data, Oklahoma Office of State Finance *Numbers have been rounded Constitutional Reserve Fund The Oklahoma Constitution mandates the creation of a Constitutional Reserve Fund (often referred to as the \\"Rainy Day Fund\\"). All revenues collected by the Oklahoma Tax Commission in excess of the revenue estimate made by the Oklahoma State Board of Equalization are deposited into the Fund. This process continues until the Fund reaches the Constitutional cap of 15% of the prior year's General Revenue Fund. All revenues not necessary to maintain the Constitutional cap are deposited into the General Revenue Fund. The Constitutional Reserve Fund can only be used under the following conditions: *3/8 of the fund can be used if General Revenue fails to meet the estimate in the current fiscal year *3/8 of the fund can be used if General Revenue is projected to decline from one year to the next *1/4 of the fund can be used if there is an emergency declaration by the Governor and a 2/3 vote in both the Senate and House of Representatives, or this same 1/4 can be used without the Governor’s declaration if there is a 3/4 vote by Senate and House of Representatives.

He was born in Haiti, grew up in Carrefour, Haiti until the age of 12. He moved to Corona, Queens, New York with his father. Here he went to high school and graduated with his high school diploma. He worked in New York for some time working often on his own artwork and earning a wage from jobs such as being a busboy at Sizzler. He and his family took a vacation to Florida one winter and it was during this vacation he decided to stay in Miami and work on his career as an artist. Serge currently resides (2010) in Miami, Florida, and states he is unsure how many signs and murals he has done although it is surely in the hundreds if not the thousands. He claims he was an artist at age 12 and the only lessons in art he had were during his required art class in high school. Serge Toussaint has four children. His mother died in 2009. Serge states that he had a past of doing things wrong, however he states he is now married and spends him time painting and enjoys spending his time doing rara lakay. Serge has been painting in Miami for decades but the 2008 Obama Presidential election brought attention to his work. Serge paints large murals (larger than 5x5). During the 2008 presidential election Serge painted several murals of Barack Obama in the Little Haiti and Liberty City areas of Miami-Dade Florida. His murals are easily recognized because he signs his name to each mural. His signature most often reads Serge with the S being a dollar sign. News reports covered Serge because one of his murals was commissioned through a state agency. This particular mural was painted under interstate I-95 and Serge painted Martin Luther King alongside Obama. According to Serge he was asked to remove the Obama portion of the mural due to government monies not being allocated for political endorsement purposes. Serge complied, and the news outlets covered the story. Serge is best known for his signature mural of the Miami Heat where he worked for just over two years and received $546,000. Since the 2008 presidential election has subsided, Serge still continues to paint notable figures and make signs for Miami-Dade neighborhoods. Serge states he loves living in Miami and is grateful to have a community of Haitians to whom he easily relates. Serge has stated that he recognizes many of the problems of Haiti (pre-2010 earthquake) and states the government is largely to blame, but he is not political and only wishes that there is more equality between the very wealthy of Haiti and the very poor of Haiti.

It was written by Jamie Brittain and directed by Minkie Spiro., Sid on e4.com/skins It aired on E4 on 22 February 2007., Skins on imdb It is told from the point of view of main character Sid Jenkins. Plot Synopsis Sid's parents, Liz and Mark, have been called into Sid's college to discuss his failing grade in A-Level history. Sid's history teacher, Tom, informs Liz, Mark and Sid that he is allowing Sid 48 hours to rewrite his paper. Mark, frustrated at his son's consistent inability to perform academically, grounds Sid and tells him to work on his history essay. He tells Sid that he is to come home immediately from drama. Sid, however, skips drama to go to College Green with Maxxie and Anwar. Sid tells Cassie that he cannot go on their date as he is grounded and has to stay at home and rewrite his history coursework. Cassie says she might come around to Sid's house. Meanwhile, on the Green, Tony tells Michelle she and Sid are to attend his concert with the City Chamber Choir that evening. Tony goes to Sid's house to tell him, also. Sid, sexually frustrated, bored, and looking forward to seeing Michelle decides to go. He changes and escapes from the house while his parents are arguing. At the concert, Tony and Abigail share a scripted kiss scene, upsetting Michelle as Tony seems a bit too into it. Michelle and Sid burst backstage where Michelle finds Tony with his hand up Abigail's shirt. Tony tells Michelle that he was just feeling Abigail's diaphragm but Michelle does not believe this. Furious, Michelle storms from the concert and Tony tells Sid he set it up on purpose so Michelle and Sid could get together. Sid, concerned, goes after Michelle, who gets attacked by a gang of chav girls, who also accuse her of giving them cheek. Sid separates Michelle and the chavs, but Michelle believes Sid must have known about Tony's plans and slaps him. Sid is then himself attacked by the chavs. Sid returns home battered and bruised and urinated on. While his mother gives him sympathy, his father chastises him on his stupidity and disobedience. Sid angers his father further by calling him a dildo. In his room, Sid finds an upset Cassie, who is hurt that Sid met up with Michelle instead of her. She kisses him on the cheek and leaves, telling Sid everything is his choice, hinting at her love on him. The next day, Sid's mum gives him a lift to college, and tries to tell him something but is unable to. She tells him he has to get on better with his dad. Sid, concerned that Michelle skived off history, calls her and arranges to meet her in a club. Cassie overhears the conversation and is distraught. At the club, Michelle apologises for forgetting Sid and Tony are different people, and the two dance. Just as it seems Sid and Michelle are going to finally get together, Tony shows up and reconciles with Michelle. Sid tries to leave, but Tony holds him back, making Sid watch while Tony steals the girl right out from under him. Cassie attempts suicide up on one of her favourite park benches, one with a view of some of Bristol's housing estates. She takes many pills with vodka. Sid rings Cassie's mobile but gets through to Jal who is riding in the ambulance with her. Sid goes to the hospital, but an angry Jal tells him to leave, as he is partially responsible for what happened. When Sid gets home he finds his dad solemn and brooding. Mark tells Sid his mother left him and Sid bitterly requotes his father's chastising remarks at the college, grounding his dad until he can win his mother back. Sid, emphatically, rewrites his history essay, staying up all night to finish it.

The piece, which comprised a collection of interacting movement loops sequenced into a single shot, was created in collaboration with advertising agency Grey London, based on a video art proposal by director Mitch Stratten. Time Sculpture holds the world record for the greatest number of moving image cameras used in a single shot. Time Sculpture was directed by Mitch Stratten and the shoot was handled by production company Hungry Man with post- production completed by The Mill in London. Time Sculpture was recognised for its innovation from within and outside of the advertising and television industries and garnered various awards including a Clio Award, a London International Award and a GTC Award. Sequence Time Sculpture opens with a fixed camera view of an undecorated art studio. On the open floor is a chair and a platform trolley. A man and a woman walk into frame from left and right respectively. The man falls to the floor and begins doing push-ups. The woman holding a set of black cards walks to the centre, spins around and throws the cards in the air. The music (\\"Air War\\" by Crystal Castles) starts and the stationary camera begins to move to the right on a consistent circular track while the elements within frame, compiled from all angles in 360 degrees, reverses back and forth at different timings in the same physical space, forming an interconnecting rhythmical pattern from the spontaneous movement captured. As more performers walk into frame some interact with props like basketballs, a pink flag and spilling two large cans of purple paint. A man encircling the group in a yellow raincoat jumps in beneath a paint spill before stepping onto the chair in a balancing act of backwards forwards movement as the music rises. The \\"flag\\" and \\"skateboard\\" men each pick up one of the balls now bouncing infinitely by themselves as a voiceover begins, stating: \\"When what we watch constantly redefines itself, shouldn't how we watch it do the same?\\" The piece closes with the Toshiba logo, the motto \\"Leading Innovation\\" and a link to the company's upscaling website. Production =Background= The second half of the 2000s (decade) saw electronics conglomerate Toshiba engaged in the high definition optical disc format war, in which it supported the HD DVD format.Williams, Martyn; \\"Toshiba, NEC Share Details of Blue-Laser Storage \\", IDG News Service, 29 August 2002.

The middling results of the campaign caused Grey to re-evaluate its approach, leading to a new campaign, which would see an advertisement \\"push the boundaries of what was possible.” To this end, Grey London re-examined several proposals presented to them in the past which had been abandoned as unworkable, before deciding upon a concept which had been proposed by Mitch Stratten. The idea, inspired by Eadweard Muybridge, was to build on the \\"bullet time\\" technology pioneered by the Wachowski brothers in the feature film The Matrix, by replacing the stills cameras with moving image cameras to show movement in a way not seen before appose to the frozen moment of \\"dead time\\". The title “time sculpture” came to the director on the way to Grey London with his producer where they presented the project as a production and post-production blueprint. =Production= The idea had originally been put aside as unachievable for a singular reason: the project required a quantity of data unprecedented in a television commercial,Stratten, Mitch; \\"Making of: Time Sculpture\\", Hungry Man (2008). and would be one of the biggest visual effects jobs ever undertaken by a commercial production company.\\"Mill Sculpts Time for Toshiba\\", The Mill, 10 December 2008.

They wanted to restrict using computer-generated imagery, and stuntwork would be kept to a minimum to maintain focus on the ordinary movements which would be seen in a completely new way through the technique. Based on early tests films of the director, a simple treatment was assembled. The piece would be set in an art school studio to \\"showcase creativity at its rawest\\" according to creative director Andy Amadeo. Timings of predeterminate movements of several performers were choreographed using computer simulations which also informed the set construction at Pinewood Studios where the shoot took place.\\"The Mill Clocks a Guinness World Record for Toshiba Time Sculpture\\", The Mill, 6 April 2009. Colour was used to isolate movement and enhance structure. It took over a month and a half to assemble the engineering team who would work on creating the custom 360 moving image capture system.

Once the rig itself was assembled, it took a team of four technicians three days to set the focus and alignment on all 200 cameras. Technology devised by electrical engineer Richard Glover was used to synchronously activate the entire system from a single remote control.\\"Toshiba Premieres the World's First Timesculpture Advert.\\" Presswire, 11 November 2008. Retrieved 5 August 2010 via Accessmylibrary.com. =Post-production= Each of the fourteen performers in Time Sculpture were captured separately from all angles by the 200 cameras. The resulting 110 hours of high definition footage, representing around 20 Tb of data, took post-production three weeks to process, running 24 hours a day, resulting in 2,500,000 single frames. In addition, the director had designed the workflow with a custom Edit Decision List and editing application to manage the vast amount of footage in the edit room. Independent programmers were commissioned to create this software, for use by editing company The Whitehouse. The initial editing pass by editor Christophe Williams pared the film down to around 30 hours. The remaining data was passed back to The Mill, who began working on compositing the film using Flame. While on set, each half of the rig had been given one run individually to create a blank background to allow The Mill to remove the rig. While minimal CGI work was needed on Time Sculpture, minor modifications to details such as lighting were made using software including Baselight, Floctane, Smoke, and Autodesk Softimage. Release and reception The final 60-second cut of Time Sculpture premiered on 10 November 2008 on terrestrial television channels ITV1, Channel 4 and on the satellite television channel Sky One.\\"Toshiba runs pounds 3m HD ads\\", Marketing, 5 November 2008.

Taxonomy This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005). Early taxonomists were able to determine that the Alexander Archipelago wolf was its own unique subspecies due to \\"common cranial characteristics\\". Taxonomists have suggested more recently that the species may have originated from another subspecies known as C. l. nubilis.MacDonald, S.O. and J.A. Cook. 2007. Mammals and amphibians of Southeast Alaska. The Museum of Southwestern Biology, Special Publication 8:1–191. Studies using mitochondrial DNA have indicated that the wolves of coastal southeast Alaska are genetically distinct from inland gray wolves, reflecting a pattern also observed in other taxa. They show a phylogenetic relationship with extirpated wolves from the south (Oklahoma), indicating that these wolves are the last remains of a once widespread group that has been largely extirpated during the last century, and that the wolves of northern North America had originally expanded from southern refuges below the Wisconsin glaciation after the ice had melted at the end of the last glacial maximum. These findings call into question the taxonomic classification of C.l. nulibus proposed by Nowak. Another study found that the wolves of coastal British Columbia were genetically and ecologically distinct from the inland wolves, including other wolves from inland British Columbia. A study of the three coastal wolves indicated a close phylogenetic relationship across regions that are geographically and ecologically contiguous, and the study proposed that C. l. ligoni (Alexander Archipelago wolf), C. l. columbianus (British Columbia wolf), and C. l. crassodon (Vancouver Island wolf) should be recognized as a single subspecies of C. lupus. In 2016, two studies compared the DNA sequences of 42,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in North American gray wolves and found the coastal wolves to be genetically and phenotypically distinct from other wolves. They share the same habitat and prey species, and form one of the study's six identified ecotypes - a genetically and ecologically distinct population separated from other populations by their different types of habitat. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects the wolf's preference to remain in the type of habitat that it was born into. Wolves that prey on fish and small deer in wet, coastal environments tend to be smaller than other wolves. Physiology =Description= Typically smaller than the other North American subspecies of wolf, the Alexander Archipelago wolf averages between . They are about long and tall at the shoulder. Their coat is generally a dark gray, with varying patterns of lighter shades.\\"Wolves of the Rain Forest\\" – Wolf Song of Alaska . Alaska.net. Retrieved on 2012-12-31. Individuals from different islands in the archipelago have a propensity for different color phases, from pure black to combinations of black and white to a much brighter cinnamon color. =Dietary habits= The primary prey of this species is the Sitka black-tailed deer, which comprises as much as 90% of an individual's diet. The next-closest consumed species, less than 10%, is the North American beaver. The average Alexander Archipelago wolf eats an estimated 26 deer per year. This habit of feeding almost entirely on a single species is peculiar to this wolf, and is not seen in other North American wolf species.Natalie G. Dawson, Stephen O. MacDonald and Joseph A. Cook (2007) 2007 endemics AA.pdf \\"Endemic Mammals of the Alexander Archipelago\\". Southeast Alaska Conservation Assessment. Southeast Alaska Conservation Assessment – Chapter 6.7 This subspecies consumes large amounts of salmon in addition to deer, beaver, mountain goat, and small mammals. Salmon make up about 10-25% of their diet. Salmon are attributed with allowing the subspecies to have one of the higher pup survivorship (90%) of the species.Riley Woodford (November 2004) \\"Alaska's Salmon-Eating Wolves\\". Alaska Fish & Wildlife News Range, population, and repopulation = Range = The range of the Alexander Archipelago wolf covers all of southeastern Alaska (the Alaskan panhandle) except the Admiralty, Baranof, and Chichagof Islands. A population estimate made in the mid-1990s with a radio-collar study produced a region-wide population estimate of 750 to 1,100, with the fall 1994 (before trapping season) population estimated to be 908. That study was conducted on Prince of Wales Island, and the region-wide estimate was made by an extrapolation based on the varying habitat capability for prey.

In 2014, the wolves' population fell from 200 to around 60 wolves -- a drop of roughly 70 percent in just one year.\\" John Platt, \\"Alaska's Rare Alexander Archipelago Wolves Nearly Wiped Out in 1 Year,\\" Scientific American, June 11, 2015 During field work in summer 2010, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFG) determined the Prince of Wales Island wolf population has recently declined sharply. ADFG was unable to collect enough wolf scats to make a population estimate based on DNA. Reportedly, \\"only a 'small fraction' of the expected number of scats\\" was found during this effort, in which a number of known denning sites were checked and transects were checked over an extensive part of the island.Comments of Greenpeace and others on the draft Tongass 5-Year Plan, fs.fed.us (November 5, 2010), citing a pers. comm. with ADF&G;'s Dave Person. In a regulatory proposal for the Alaska Board of Game's November 2010 meeting to help protect the species, ADFG estimated the island's wolf population to be 150,See: Proposal 18 in the Alaska Board Of Game's Fall 2010 Proposal Book for the Southeast Region. http://www.boards.adfg.state.ak.us/gameinfo/meetinfo/2010-2011/southeast/crass- final9-7-10.pdf down by half or more from the 300–350 for the island determined by the 1990s radio-collar study. = Reproduction = In southeast Alaska, pups are usually born during the last 2 weeks of April. Dens are usually built 4–5 weeks prior to the birth, between the roots of trees, in small caves, or crevices in rocks, abandoned beaver lodges, or expanded mammal burrows. History – managerial and political The Alexander Archipelago wolf first arrived in Alaska sometime between 7,000 and 8,000 years ago, after the end of the Wisconsin glaciation period. The species was likely following the migration of the Sitka deer as they traveled north because of geographical and climate change in the area. The first observation of concern for the possible instability of the Alexander Archipelago wolf population was by a USDA Forest Service-sponsored interagency committee. This concern came about because of the extensive logging being conducted in the region's forest, under the Tongass Land Management Plan.U.S. Forest Service. 1979. Tongass Land Management Plan. (See also later revisions.) = Endangered Species Act petition – 1993 to 1997 = A petition was presented to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in December 1993 by the Biodiversity Legal Foundation and an independent biologist, requesting the Alexander Archipelago wolf to be listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. The agency published a positive 90-day finding in the Federal Register on May 20, 1994, but near the end of the year, issued another finding that a \\"listing is not warranted at this time\\", but that if the logging was not reduced or reservation areas created, the \\"long-term viability of the Alexander Archipelago wolf is seriously imperiled.\\" Petition to List the Alexander Archipelago wolf under Provision of the Endangered Species Act, 12-Month Finding. US Fish & Wildlife Service, Dec. 8, 1994; signature date Feb. 15, 1995. To better assess the status of the species, the FWS ordered a conservation assessment to be made in terms of specific data of the species and its viability for the future. After the assessment was completed, more studies were undertaken to understand exactly how the Alexander Archipelago wolf fits into the food chain and what effect extensive logging would cause. After study that, between 1995 and 2045, the population of the Alexander Archipelago wolf was surmised to \\"decline as much as 25%\\", along with Sitka deer population declining by 28% within the same time. In 1994, the FWS issued a memo stating, \\"not protecting the wolf would be the 'least controversial option'\\". This was in regards to the logging companies and lobbyists that opposed restrictions on logging in the area, which protecting the Alexander Archipelago wolf would create. In 1997, the petition was denied due to the findings that wolves in southeast Alaska would not be in danger of extinction within the foreseeable future. Jack Ward Thomas wrote in his book, Jack Ward Thomas: the journals of a Forest Service chief, about a meeting held in 1995 in regards to a consideration by the Forest Service to list the Alexander Archipelago wolf and the Queen Charlotte goshawk as threatened. The meeting was between Thomas, Undersecretary James Lyons, Deputy Undersecretary Adela Backiel, and Alaska Regional Forester Phil Janik, all on behalf of the Forest Service, and Ted Stevens, Frank Murkowski, and Don Young. The main argument was from Stevens, Murkowski, and Young, who believed that the Forest Service was trying to purposefully limit the lumber market in Alaska. They demanded that the two species not be listed or that negative legislation would follow, likely resulting in budget and personnel cuts for the Forest Service. The Tongass Land Management Plan (forest plan) was revised in 1997 after immense pressure from environmental groups to list the Alexander Archipelago wolf as threatened. The plan included a standard and guideline to sustain a habitat carrying capacity of least 18 Sitka deer per square mile to provide adequate prey and to limit the density of roads (i.e. miles of road per square mile). The forest plan also established a system of habitat reserves.1997 Tongass Land Management Plan. USDA Forest Service. On the basis of the new plan, shortly afterward, FWS made a final determination that listing the wolf as threatened was unwarranted.12-Month Finding for a Petition to List the Alexander Archipelago wolf as Threatened and to Designate Critical Habitat .

The petition requested consideration for a separate listing of the Prince of Wales Island population because it is believed to be a distinct population segment, as well as a listing for the subspecies as a whole. In March 2014 the agency published a finding in the Federal Register that listing the Alexander Archipelago wolf \\"may be warranted.\\"Louis Sahagun (March 28, 2014) Rare Alaska wolf may get Endangered Species Act Protection. Los Angeles Times. The finding was positive on three of the five factors that the Endangered Species Act requires the agency to consider. Those are: \\"the present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range\\"; overutilization; and \\"the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms.\\" In making its finding, the agency opened a 60-day public comment period, after which it will proceed to do a formal status review of the species followed by a final decision on listing. How long that may take is in question. The agencies say several years may be needed to get funding to complete the review,Joe Viechnicki (March 28, 2014), Fish and Wildlife to review Southeast Alaska wolves.

High Country News, Missoula Independent, April 6. The FWS would prefer to leave management of the wolf with the state, if the state will create a viable plan for wolf conservation; however, the service will list the species if it determines doing so is necessary to protect the species' existence. The supervisor of the Tongass National Forest, Forrest Cole, said the Forest Service will cooperate with the FWS in evaluating the status of the species.Mary Kauffman (March 29, 2014), Alexander Archipelago wolf listing as \\"endangered or threatened may be warranted\\" says USFWS. Sit News. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game's Division of Wildlife Conservation does not believe the Alexander Archipelago wolf is at risk now or threatened with the risk of extinction in the foreseeable future. However, the division's primary researcher on the status of the species, Dr. David Person, who was involved in that effort for 22 years, quit the agency in May 2013 and subsequently wrote a declaration, concerning the Forest Service's Big Thorne timber sale, that the predator-prey ecosystem, including wolves, on Prince of Wales Island is threatened with collapse because of the cumulative impacts of logging and logging roads.David Person (August 15, 2013), Statement Of David K. Person Regarding The Big Thorne Project, Prince Of Wales Island.Jennifer Canfield (Oct. 11, 2013), TimberVs. Wolves . Juneau Empire = Litigation = Greenpeace and the Cascadia Wildlands Project pointed out in 2008 that data the Forest Service was using were known to be prone to cause overestimation of the carrying capacity for deer,Caouette, J.; Kramer, M.; Nowacki, G. 2000. Deconstructing the Tongass Timber Paradigm. USDA Forest Service. the wolves' primary prey. Furthermore, the conversion factor, known as the \\"deer multiplier\\", used in the calculations was incorrectly applied, causing a 30% overestimation of carrying capacity and corresponding underestimation of impacts. The two organizations determined, in total, the carrying capacity for the Sitka deer in places throughout the Tongass had been generally been overestimated by the Forest Service in its timber planning, by as much as 120% (varying geographically due to the faulty data). In 2008, Greenpeace and the Cascadia Wildlands Project sued to stop the Forest Service from proceeding with four timber sales on the Tongass NF slated to extract around \\"30 million board-feet of Tongass timber\\", an amount close to the annual volume then being logged.Greenpeace v. Cole. Filed in U.S. District Court, Anchorage, Alaska. The sales are on Prince of Wales, Kupreanof, Mitkof, and Revillagigedo Islands. The suit challenged the agency's method of calculating the impact of logging on habitat carrying capacity for deer. In a radio story, the plaintiff's spokesman explained that the data being used to represent habitat quality are actually uncorrelated to habitat quality, and that the deer multiplier mentioned above was misused according to the science under which it was derived.Joe Viechnicki (July 14, 2008) Groups challenge Tongass deer calculations . KFSK radio The story points to the Forest Service's underestimation of impacts not only to wolves but to subsistence deer hunters. In May 2010, US District Judge Ralph Beistline denied the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, saying he \\"found no wrongdoing on the part of the Forest Service\\" and it was a \\"scientific disagreement\\". The plaintiffs have appealed the decision to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals (case 10-35567).

The ruling says, in part: :\\"We do not think that USFS has adequately explained its decision to approve the four logging projects in the Tongass. ... USFS has failed to explain how it ended up with a table that identifies 100 deer per square mile as a maximum carrying capacity, but allows 130 deer per square mile as a potential carrying capacity. 'The agency is obligated to articulate a rational connection between the facts found and the choices made,' which the agency has not done here. Pac. Coast Fed’n of Fisherman’s Ass’ns v.

USFS itself has recognized the limitations in the VolStrata data. ... Because we must remand to the agency to re-examine its Deer Model, we need not decide whether the use of the VolStrata data was arbitrary and capricious. We anticipate that, in reviewing the proposed projects, USFS will use the best available data ...\\" In a statement to the press, a spokesman for the plaintiffs said the principles in this lawsuit apply to every significant timber sale between 1996 and 2008 before the Forest Service corrected errors in the deer model when the agency issued its revised Tongass Forest Plan, but, he said, the agency still fails to address cumulative impacts to deer, especially on Prince of Wales Island, as challenged in the Logjam timber sale lawsuit.Jonathan Grass (August 3, 2011) Appeals court overturns 4 Tongass logging projects . Juneau Empire. He also said, \\"The purpose of the lawsuit is to make the Forest Service go back and do its analysis right on these timber sales.

They are currently a civil servant working with the Malawi government. =Raising Malawi Academy for Girls= Once the Raising Malawi Academy for Girls (RMAG) project was terminated, a report was published that placed blame on Oponyo and Philippe Van Den Bossch, boyfriend of Madonna's former trainer.http://www.newsweek.com/2011/04/03/madonna-s-malawi- disaster.html The report was created by philanthropic consulting firm Global Philanthropy Group, hired by the board of directors of Raising Malawi in November 2010 to help the organization restructure its strategy and approach. The report implied that Oponyo and Van Den Bossch had acted outside their contracted roles. The report accused her of “outlandish expenditures”, including getting a \\"high salary, a car, housing, and a golf-club membership\\", all which were included in her contract by Madonna's aides. Legal suit Eight staff members of RMAG, including Oponyo, lodged the action with lawyer Charles Mpaka at the end of March 2011, claiming they were let go without proper termination procedures.https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gu7xv7yKeCLdGBhsZeIGb5f4uF3Q?docId=CNG.3d22b01370fecf73a221d556297b13b9.851 The staff claims that they were being forced to sign a discriminatory termination agreement which was \\"unfair and unconstitutional\\" and included a 'confidentiality agreement' which prevents them from defending themselves against defamation and libel. Madonna's lawyer, Davis Njobvu, argued to the court that RMI was a registered trust in the United States and only provided funds for the construction and that there were no contracts signed between Raising Malawi, Inc. (RMI) and the former staff members. A Malawi court dismissed a legal action by Madonna to prevent their charity project from being sued by former employees for unfair dismissal and non-payment of benefits. All of the former RMAG staff members, except for Oponyo, have since settled with RMI. Raising Malawi now supports education projects in Malawi through constructing community-based schools in the Kasungu District and by supporting scholarships for girls in secondary school.http://www.millenniumvillages.org/field-notes/young-girls-in-malawi- get-chance-at-secondary-education Madonna's visit to Malawi in April 2013 to see these schools was soured by a war of words.

A majority of Italians supported the ban at the time it was first implemented, but there was a lack of support from smokers and some bar owners. 5% of bar and restaurant owners immediately introduced separate smoking rooms.  History  Italy saw a push against cigarettes in 1986, by then Health Minister Costante Degan, but the push would be forgotten amid other concerns. The push to restrict cigarette use in public would be taken back up however, and on November 11, 1975 law no. 584 was passed prohibiting smoking on public transport and in some places such as hospitals, cinemas, theaters, universities, museums, and libraries. Italy was the 4th European country to introduce a smoking ban in public places. On 1 August 2005 a judge ruled that business owners could not be punished for not informing the police about infringing customers. The rates of law enforcement are higher in Northern Italy, Tuscany and Sardinia, with lower rates in Southern Italy, especially in Calabria (70%) and Campania (76%). Heart attacks in Italian adults dropped significantly following the implementation of the smoking ban. The decline in heart attacks was attributed to less passive smoking. Health Minister Girolamo Sirchia said that smoking was the leading preventable cause of death in Italy. The ban caused an 8% decrease in cigarette consumption. The smoking rate in Italy between 2000 and 2020 is about 23.7%; slightly higher than the United States' 21.8%. Furthermore, data shows a general downward trend in smoking rate between 2000 and 2016. In 2005 when smoking was banned in public places the rate was about 25.6% and fell to the current level of about 23.7% showing that the law did in fact limit and discourage citizens from smoking.

The pair have sung songs in Urdu, Pashto, Dari and Turkish, combining pop with folk music to create a diverse body of work. Their music has been described as alternative, art folk, ethnic blues and easy listening by international reviewers and critics. The band was a project started by two cousins, Zebunnisa Bangash and Haniya Aslam, both of whom are ethnic Pashtuns. Brought up with music, they began writing together when studying as undergraduates at Smith College and Mount Holyoke College in the United States. While their family is originally from Kohat, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, much of the band's work took place in Islamabad and Lahore. Touring in 2009, they have performed mostly in Dubai, and in some parts of Sindh and Punjab.

As soon as Televisa opened its Centro de Educación Artistica in 1979, she transferred to that school, becoming one of its first graduates in 1981. That was the year she made her first television appearance on Cachun Cachun Ra Ra. Her first featured television role was on the telenovela Una limosna de amor, which also premiered in 1981. Over the next several years Ferreira would be regularly cast in several telenovelas (Cuando los hijos se van, Principessa, Senda de gloria) as well as on the comedy series Antojitos Mexicanos.

She even invited singers, including Pepe Aguilar, Pedro Fernández, Maribel Guardia, Alejandra Guzmán, Lucero, Timbiriche and Gloria Trevi, among others, to perform on her show. The show consisted of comedy sketches and musical numbers. Some of these musical numbers were performed by the cast, while others were by the musical guests (who would be phased out by the mid-1990s.) Among the most notable sketches on the program were El y Ella and Coralia y Yadhira. Coralia Davalillo (Ferreira) was a teenaged girl who lived with her mother, Yadhira (Delgado). One of the Coralia y Yadhira sketches featured one of the most famous musical numbers in Anabel's long run, that being Coralia's performance, at a talent competition, of \\"La Licuadora.\\"\\"La Licuadora\\" at youtube.com Ferreira's contract with Televisa would not be renewed in 1996, resulting in Anabel's cancellation after eight years on the air. The TV Azteca years (1997–2007) In 1997, Ferreira was cast by TV Azteca to host a variety show titled, Buenos Noches con Anabel. However, after a few weeks, the series was cancelled, and as a result Ferreira spent the next decade making guest appearances on other TV Azteca programs. Unable to get another series on the network, Ferreira decided to leave TV Azteca in 2007 and prepared for her return to Televisa. Near the end of her time at TV Azteca, she was profiled in the 2007 book, Televisa Presenta, which coincided with Televisa's golden anniversary as a network. Returning to Televisa (2008–present) Ferreira rejoined Televisa in 2008Anabel Ferreira Regresa a Televisa at youtube.com and has since been a guest on many recent programs, including Hoy, Muevete and Desmadruga2. She was a guest co-host of one episode of the latter program not soon after she returned to the network. In 2009 while still under Televisa contract, Ferreira relocated to her current home in Los Angeles; she and Guardia are among the few Televisa contract players to reside in the United States while still working in Mexico full-time. Soy tu Dueña premiered in 2010 and marked her first regular television series role in 13 years and her first for Televisa since 1996. Ferreira's castmates on this series include Lucero and Silvia Pinal. For her work in television Ferreira has been inducted into the Paseo de las Luminarias in Mexico City.

His name means One Who Lives Above. The story of his creation tells that in the beginning, before there were earth or sky there was only darkness. Into it came a small and thin disc with yellow and white on its alternate sides, and inside it sat Kuterastan, a small bearded man no larger than a frog. Kuterastan is described as awakening and rubbing his eyes. When he peers above him into the darkness it filled with light and illuminated the darkness below. When he looked east the light became tinged with the yellow of dawn, and when he looked west the light was shaded with the amber tones of dusk. As he glanced about himself clouds in different colors appeared. Then again Kuterastan rubbed his eyes and face, and as he flung the sweat from his hands another cloud appeared with a tiny little girl Stenatliha sitting on top. Stenatliha's name translates as the Woman Without Parents. Kuterastan and Stenatliha were puzzled where the other had come from, and where were the Earth and Sky. After thinking for some time, Kuterastan again rubbed his eyes and face, then his hands together, and from the sweat flying as he opened hands first Chuganaai, the Sun, and then Hadintin Skhin, or Pollen Boy, appeared. After the four sat a long time in silence on a single cloud, Kuterastan finally broke the silence to say, \\"What shall we do?\\" and started the creation. The story describes the sequence, with Nacholecho, the Tarantula, the first to be created. Kuterastan followed by making the Big Dipper, the wind, lightning, and thunder, each given their characteristic tasks. Finding the cloud a poor home, he then turned his attention to making the earth. With the sweat of the four gods mixed together in Kuterastan's palms there emerged a small brown ball no bigger than a bean. This was expanded as the gods kicked the small brown ball. Then the wind went inside the ball and to inflate it. Tarantula attached to the ball a spun black cord and stretched it far to the east. Tarantula also attached one cord each of blue, yellow and white to the ball pulling one far to the south, another west, and the last to the north. When Tarantula was finished, the earth was vast expanse of smooth brown plain. Poles were placed at each corner to hold the earth in place. And at this Kuterastan sang a repeating refrain, \\"The world is now made and it sits still.\\" References Category:Apache culture Category:Creation myths Category:Creator gods Category:Gods of the indigenous peoples of North America ","title":"Kuterastan"},{"id":"28272653","text":"Llera Municipality may refer to: * Llera, Badajoz, Spain * Llera, Tamaulipas, Mexico Category:Municipality name disambiguation pages ","title":"Llera Municipality"},{"id":"28272656","text":"\\"Maxxie and Anwar\\" is the sixth episode of the first series of the British teen drama Skins. It was written by Simon Amstell and Ben Schiffer and was directed by Chris Clough.Maxxie and Anwar at e4.com It first aired on E4 on 1 March 2007.Skins at imdb.com It is told from the points of view of main characters Maxxie Oliver and Anwar Kharral. Plot synopsis Roundview Sixth Form College's Year 12 history class (and, for some reason, Tony) are going to Russia to study post-Soviet developments in the country. The class is excited to arrive, but not for the \\"learning experience\\" that teacher Tom is so enthused over, but because they are planning on a massive party, and are smuggling drugs into Russia stored in Sid's anus. As the group land in Russia, Sid gets through the metal detectors but is close to being found out by sniffer dogs. He is saved when Anwar accidentally sets off a metal detector and is forced to have a rectal inspection himself, and Tom has to pay for his release using American money which is never actually explained or even acknowledged. The day gets worse when their bus is discovered to have broken down, forcing them to hitch a ride on an open-roofed cattle wagon to their youth centre, which is an abandoned, prison-like place. To make matters even worse than this, Sid discovers he is constipated, and they are unable to get the drugs. Maxxie and Anwar share a room. Anwar is impressed by the drawings Maxxie has made of the two, but is shocked when he discovered Maxxie has drawn a picture of Anwar's penis. After Anwar makes a homophobic remark, Maxxie angrily storms off to Tony and Sid's room, requesting that he swap with Sid. Tony, sensing an opportunity to \\"try something new,\\" immediately begins hitting on Maxxie, trying to get him to let him perform fellatio. Meanwhile, Anwar sees a beautiful Russian girl working outside a nearby house, and immediately call the others. By the time they arrive, though, she is not there, and they assume he is making it up. That night, Chris calls in to say goodnight to Angie, but must hide under the bed when Tom arrives and tries to impress Angie by doing squats in his underwear. After Tom falls asleep, Chris kisses Angie goodnight and leaves. At the same time, Anwar sees the Russian girl in her bedroom, this time in her underwear. She sees him through her mirror and waves. The next morning, they are woken up by a loud bell, and are made to wash using an outside hose pipe. They are then taken to a glue factory, where they learn the hard way how glue is made. That afternoon, Maxxie, after being reminded of his conflict with Anwar by Tony, has a furious argument with him, calling Anwar a hypocrite for ignoring the rules of his religion when it suits him (his drug and alcohol abuse and lack of respect for women), but refusing to ignore his faith for his best friend. In a rage, Maxxie begins to pound walls and kick doors. He accidentally kicks one door open and is confronted by Chris and Angie having sex, causing him to hastily pull it shut in shock. Attracted by the noise, the owner of the hostel, Mrs Rynkowski, yells at him to stop, but softens when she notices how upset he is. She warms up to him greatly when she sees his Neil Diamond T-shirt, and invites him to her private quarters to share some vodka and listen to some Neil Diamond records. Meanwhile, Anwar sees the Russian girl again, but this time, so does Sid. They see that she is being hit by an older man they assume to be her father, and decide to rescue her. Jal and Michelle, bored, decide to go out to meet Russian men, and the four meet awkwardly in the hall. Michelle and Jal go to a small and gritty tavern, where they are immediately chatted up by some Russian policemen. Meanwhile, Sid and Anwar reach the house and manage to smuggle the Russian girl, whose name is Anka, back to the hostel. Sid, who did not leave in time, tries to distract the \\"father,\\" only to give himself away, forcing him to flee through a nearby forest, pursued by the crazed man with a shotgun. At the hostel, Anwar discovers that Anka can speak English quite fluently, clearly having learned it from watching the American show Friends (\\"I learn from, like, the best American show ever! How you doin'?\\"), although the name of the show is never explicitly mentioned. She then persuades him to have sex with her. Tony, hearing them from his room, comes in and sees them, before running off and telling everyone else. At that moment, Sid arrives back, followed by Anka's shotgun-bearing 'father,' whom she reveals is actually her husband. Realising at once that they have been having sex, the husband draws his shotgun on Anwar, but it is grabbed from him by Maxxie, who has heard the commotion from the hostel owner's quarters. After he draws a pistol, the two find themselves in a standoff, which is soon fixed when the gang of policemen Jal and Michelle met at the tavern arrive and arrest him. Jal and Michelle return, drunk, and Tom is forced to pay the fee for armed response. Anka, acting as a translator, reveals that they will also have to cut the trip short and leave the next morning for their troubles. Maxxie attempts to make amends with Anwar, who confesses to being a hypocrite, but still cannot accept Maxxie's sexuality. In his room after this, Tony hits on Maxxie again. Maxxie gives in and allows Tony to perform fellatio on him, not noticing that Michelle, who was passed out on Tony's bed, has woken up and is watching the whole thing in horror. When finished, Maxxie notes he has finally found something Tony isn't good at. The next morning on the plane, Michelle tries to get Tony to confess to having oral sex with Maxxie, but he doesn't. Sid finally begins to get over his constipation, but is informed, to his dismay, that Heathrow security is very tight, and it would be better to keep the drugs until they get through. In a final scene, back in Russia, it emerges that the local police, Mrs. Rynkowski, Anka and her husband are all in league with each other, and the whole visit had been a scheme to swindle as much money as possible from English tourists, whom they call \\"rich and stupid.\\" It is, however, revealed that Anka genuinely liked Anwar.

It stars Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess, with Patricia Clarkson, Ken Stott and Romola Garai in supporting roles. It was released in the United States on 19 August 2011 by Focus Features and in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2011 by Universal Pictures. Plot The film follows Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley on the same day—15 July, St. Swithin's day—over 18 years. On 15 July 1988, after their graduation from the University of Edinburgh, Dexter and Emma spend a platonic night together and agree to “just be friends”. One year later, Dexter helps Emma move to London to pursue a career as a writer. Finding little success by 1990, she ends up a waitress in a Mexican restaurant, where she meets Ian, an aspiring comedian. Meanwhile, Dexter travels the world, staying in touch with Emma. He visits her on 15 July 1991 and suggests they take a holiday. They go to France in 1992; despite their mutual attraction, Emma turns down Dexter’s advances. By 1993, Dexter is a successful television presenter with a raucous late-night show. Dexter visits his parents on 15 July 1994 after his mother is diagnosed with terminal cancer. He arrives still under the influence from a night of heavy partying, infuriating his father. His mother is unimpressed with his wild lifestyle, and tells him he is not yet a nice person. That night, Emma goes on a date with Ian; despite their lack of chemistry, they begin a relationship. By 1995, Emma is a school teacher and lives with Ian, but is increasingly irritated by his laziness. Dexter’s new show makes him \\"the most annoying man on telly\\". Meeting Emma for dinner on 15 July 1996, Dexter gets high on cocaine, flirts with another woman, and insults Emma. She storms off and, deciding that they have outgrown each other, tells him that although she loves him, she no longer likes him. Two years later, Dexter loses his television career, and by 1999, is in a serious relationship with Sylvie. Meanwhile, Emma has split up with Ian; he confronts her over their breakup and his jealousy of Dexter after reading her diary. Before leaving, he praises the stories in her diary and urges her to have them published. On 15 July 2000, Emma and Dexter attend the wedding of mutual friends. Dexter receives a job offer from Calum, his old roommate who has since become a multimillionaire. Emma tells Dexter she has received a book deal, and Dexter reveals that he and Sylvie are to be married, as he will soon be a father. Dexter and Emma rekindle their friendship. By 2001, Dexter is a devoted father to his daughter Jasmine, unaware Sylvie is having an affair with Calum, and Emma's book is published. Two years pass and Dexter, divorced, visits Emma, now a successful author living in Paris. Hopeful after a previous drunken tryst with Emma following his divorce, Dexter learns she has a new French boyfriend, and departs. Emma has second thoughts and chases after Dexter. They share a passionate kiss, and finally begin a relationship together. Emma and Dexter are engaged by 2004 and eventually marry. Dexter opens a café in England, sharing custody of Jasmine, and he and Emma try, unsuccessfully, to have a child. On 15 July 2006, Emma is hit by a truck while riding her bicycle, and dies. Inconsolable, Dexter returns to his self- destructive habits. Over the years, he is comforted by Sylvie, by Jasmine, his widowed father, and even Ian, now happily married with children, who visits Dexter and tells him that Emma \\"lit up\\" around him, assuring Dexter that \\"she made you decent… and you made her so happy\\". On 15 July 2011, Dexter visits Arthur's Seat in Scotland with Jasmine. The film flashes back to 1988: after their night together, Dexter declines Emma’s invitation to spend the day with her, but changes his mind. They climb Arthur's Seat and at the top, Dexter suggests that instead of being casual friends, they “finish what they started” the previous night. They race back to the flat, but encounter Dexter's parents on the street. Emma leaves, and Dexter tries to tell his parents she is just a friend, but chases after her to ask for her number. They kiss passionately, and promise to see each other again. Cast * Anne Hathaway as Emma Morley * Jim Sturgess as Dexter Mayhew * Romola Garai as Sylvie Cope * Rafe Spall as Ian, Emma's comedian boyfriend * Ken Stott as Steven, Dexter's father * Patricia Clarkson as Alison, Dexter's mother * Jodie Whittaker as Tilly, Emma's university friend * Tom Mison as Callum, Dexter's university friend * Jamie Sives as Mr. Jamie Hazeel * Toby Regbo as Samuel Cope, Sylvie's brother * Georgia King as Suki Meadows, girlfriend of Dexter * Matt Berry as Aaron * Matthew Beard as Murray Cope, Sylvie's brother * Heida Reed as Ingrid * Amanda Fairbank Hynes as Tara Production The film is a co-production between Random House Films and Focus Features. Film4 Productions is co-financing. Actress Anne Hathaway said she was clandestinely given the script as the film was set in the United Kingdom and director Scherfig was not looking for any American actresses for the part. Hathaway flew to London for a meeting with Scherfig to explain why she should get the part. Hathaway later said it was \\"the worst meeting of my life... I was just inarticulate\\", but on leaving Hathaway wrote out a list of songs for Scherfig to listen to, saying, \\"I clearly didn't communicate to you what I needed to today. But I think these songs can do it for me.\\" Scherfig did listen to them, which led to Hathaway getting the part. Principal photography commenced in July 2010. Filming took place on location in Scotland, England and France. The production filmed in Edinburgh, the city where Dexter and Emma first meet, in August 2010. Various landmark locations, including Arthur's Seat, were used. Production then moved to London. Parliament Hill Lido in north London was used for scenes in which Emma, of varying ages, swims. Filming took place inside a house in Granville Road in Stroud Green for scenes involving Jim Sturgess and Romola Garai. Scenes in the shop and cafe were filmed at Leila's shop and cafe on Arnold Circus, close to Brick Lane in the East End. UK railway Station filming took place at Ridgmont Station on the Bedford to Bletchley Marston Vale Line. Filming in France took place in Dinan and Dinard, near Saint-Malo, in Brittany. A seaside club was turned into the Café Paradis, designed to ape Greek themes. Critical reception The film is ranked as \\"rotten\\" on Rotten Tomatoes with a 36% positive approval rating (only 52 out of 143 critics gave positive reviews), with the consensus stating \\"Despite some fresh narrative twists, One Day lacks the emotion, depth, or insight of its bestselling source material\\". CinemaScore polls reported that the average grade moviegoers gave the film was a \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Betsey Sharkey of the Los Angeles Times called it a \\"heartbreaking disappointment of a film\\" while Peter Howell of the Toronto Star said \\"Long before the credits roll, you may find yourself wishing your life could flash before your eyes, to end the monotony of this relentless turning of calendar pages.\\" In contrast, Roger Ebert said \\"One Day has style, freshness, and witty bantering dialogue.\\" Anne Hathaway's Yorkshire accent in the role of Emma has been widely regarded as subpar. Newspaper columnist Suzanne Moore, reviewing the film on BBC Radio 4's Front Row, said the accents were \\"all over the shop\\". Moore went on to say, \\"Sometimes she's from Scotland, sometimes she's from New York, you just can't tell\\".

Shōda was born in Etajima in Hiroshima Prefecture in 1910. Around 1920 her family moved to Ujina, just outside Hiroshima, and in 1925 she enrolled in a Jōdo Shinshū girls' high school, graduating in 1929. In the late 1920s, she started publishing poetry in Kōran, a monthly literary magazine. Shōda married engineer Takamoto Suematsu and the two had a son, Shin'ichirō. In 1940 her husband died and in 1945 her family home was destroyed, forcing the family to move into the city of Hiroshima. On August 6, 1945, the city was devastated by the atomic bomb attack. Shōda's home at that time was only two kilometers from ground zero. By February of the next year, her father had died of intestinal cancer and later her son also fell ill. Following Japan's surrender, Shōda started writing traditional tanka poetry on the theme of the atomic bombing. She had difficulty publishing both because of the subject and because of her relative lack of experience. In 1946 she succeeded in publishing 39 of her poems in the journal Fuschichō. In 1947, evading Occupation censorship, she secretly published Sange (\\"Penitence\\" or \\"Repentance\\"), a tanka anthology. 150 copies of the book were mimeographed by a clerk at the Hiroshima prison and Shōda personally distributed it to victims of the blast. She published little after Sange until the 1960s when, in 1962 she published a memoir, A Ringing in the Ears. Shortly after its publication, she fell ill with breast cancer and her health deteriorated rapidly. She died on 15 June 1965, the year before the publication of her second tanka collection, Sarusuberi (\\"Crape myrtle\\"), published in 1966. \\"Reiko\\" along with \\"Chanchako Bachan\\" (\\"Old woman in chanchako, or a padded sleeveless jacket”), was posthumously published in Dokyumento Nihonjin (\\"Document of the Japanese\\") in 1969. Pikakko-chan contains seven stories, including “Reiko” and \\"Chanchako Bachan\\". One of her poems from Sange appears on the Monument of the A-bombed Teachers and Students of National Elementary Schools in Hiroshima.

As of 2010, legislation banning smoking within each of these jurisdictions is mostly consistent, despite the separate development of legislation by each jurisdiction. Notable variations between the jurisdictions include: whether, and in what circumstances ventilated smoking rooms are permitted; whether, and up to what distance away from a building is smoking banned outside of a building; and, whether smoking is banned in private vehicles occupied by children. Some municipalities have bylaws restricting smoking further than the applicable national/provincial/territorial legislation. There have also been significant changes to public smoking regulations across the country following the legalization of recreational cannabis on October 17, 2018. This has resulted in additional regulations pertaining to the public consumption of cannabis in each province, with varying similarity to regulations concerning tobacco consumption. The federal government's smoking ban in workplaces and on common carriers applies only to the federal government and to federally regulated businesses, such as airports. Smoking rooms are not permitted. As of 2015, 13.0% of Canadians aged 15 and older smoke.

Biography He was born Mitsuyoshi Tōge in Osaka as the youngest son of Ki'ichi Tōge, a successful manufacturer of bricks. From the start Tōge was a sickly child, suffering from asthma and periodic vomiting. He graduated from Hiroshima Prefecture's school of commerce in 1935, and started working for the Hiroshima Gas Company. In 1938 Tōge was diagnosed, wrongly, with tuberculosis. Believing himself to have only a few years to live, he spent most of his time as an invalid. In 1948 Tōge learned that the diagnosis was wrong. He had bronchiectasis, an enlargement of the bronchial tube. He started composing poems in the second year of middle school. Early influences included Tolstoy, Heine, Tōson Shimazaki, and Haruo Sato. In 1938 he read his first piece of proletarian literature. In December 1942, he was baptized into the Catholic Church. By 1945 he composed three thousand tanka and even more haiku. They were mostly lyric poems. Twenty-four-year-old Tōge was in Hiroshima when the atomic bomb was dropped on the city. By 1951 he was writing poetry startlingly different from his earlier efforts. In 1949 Toge joined the Japanese Communist Party. His first collection of the atomic bomb works, Genbaku shishu (\\"Poems of the Atomic Bomb\\") was published in 1951. Tōge died at the age of 36 in the operating room in Hiroshima. His first-hand experience with the atomic bomb, his passion for peace and his realistic insight into the event made him the leading poet in Hiroshima.

Inspired by the Halo video games series, the game sees players control Master Chief and fight through 64 screens with varied enemies. Completing the game once unlocks a tougher \\"Legendary\\" mode. Halo 2600 was written by Ed Fries, former vice president of game publishing at Microsoft, who was involved in Microsoft's acquisition of Halo developers Bungie. Fries enjoyed the creative problems involved with creating a game with extreme technical constraints. Upon release, the game was generally well- received, and was selected for inclusion in a Smithsonian American Art Museum exhibit. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot Halo 2600 is an action-adventure shooter video game, with gameplay inspired by the Atari titles Adventure and Berzerk; it plays as a \\"demake\\" of the Halo video games as if they were created for the Atari 2600. The player uses the joystick to control the character of Master Chief, the protagonist of the Halo video games, as he makes his way through 64 screens, divided into four zones: outdoors, Covenant base, ice world, and a final boss area. Weapons and power-ups are available to combat the many enemies that appear. The player and enemies can each be killed by one hit, unless a shield is collected. The player has three lives. After successfully completing the game once, the player can play through the game in \\"Legendary mode\\", with the game tweaked for an extra challenge. Development Ed Fries in 2015 Ed Fries got a taste of game development in his teenage years, developing Atari 800 games at home. Fries took a summer internship with Microsoft in college and eventually joined the company. In 2000, he was head of Microsoft Game Studios, trying to develop a launch lineup for Microsoft's unproven Xbox console. After being contacted by developer Bungie's vice president about a possible acquisition, Fries shepherded Microsoft's purchase of Bungie and their developing project, a game that would become the Xbox's killer app, Halo: Combat Evolved. Fries left Microsoft in January 2004, after 18 years with the company. Fries read the book Racing the Beam: The Atari Video Computer System by Ian Bogost and Nick Montfort, which is about programming for the Atari 2600, and was inspired to create his own game. Initially, Fries only intended to recreate the Master Chief, but decided to finish the project after encouragement. He was aided by an extensive community of homebrew enthusiasts, where he found emulators, example code, and documentation. Despite having been released in 1977 and ending production in 1992, the Atari 2600 retained a dedicated hobbyist industry who still bought and played classic games. Fries found the challenge of Halo 2600 one of adapting to constraints. The Atari 2600 has millions of times less space and memory than was available for Halo. With only 128 bytes of RAM, drawing Master Chief was difficult, and creating a game with other characters even more so. Fries later stated that making the game taught him that constraint is sometimes a fuel for creativity, comparing the process of adapting Halo to the effort in turning a novel into a poem or haiku. \\"It felt more like writing poetry than it did like writing regular code\\", he said. \\"It felt like everything had to be so tight, so perfect. If even one of these tricks didn't exist, if I didn't have this incredibly clever way of drawing this sprite, or if I didn't have this incredibly sick code for drawing the missiles, I wouldn't have been able to fit it in. I couldn't have made the machine do what I wanted it to do.\\" Fries pointed to other artists' work such as Bach's fugues or elaborate origami as examples of deliberately setting constraints to create something more interesting. The full game takes up just 4 kilobytes of space. Reception and legacy The game was released in July 2010 at the Classic Gaming Expo. At the exposition, a limited number of physical copies of the game were on sale. It was one of four new Atari 2600 titles released by AtariAge at the 2010 Classic Gaming Expo in Las Vegas, along with Duck Attack!, K.O. Cruiser (a boxing game) and a port of Sega's 1981 arcade game Turbo. The game was also made available for play on modern computers via an emulator. Halo 2600 was generally well received. Kotakus Owen Good and Destructoids Conrad Zimmerman called it an entertaining diversion. The gameplay was called \\"rough\\" but \\"amazing\\" by John Biggs of TechCrunch, who cited the immense size constraints involved in creating the game. Zimmerman called the game's controls capable, and The Escapist Andy Chalk highlighted the game's chiptune soundtrack. Anthony John Agnello, writing for The A.V. Club, noted the incongruity of seeing a \\"modern blockbuster\\" transformed into devolved version on the 2600's \\"aesthetically abrasive\\" hardware. The source code of the game was used to create an 8-bit poster representation of Master Chief. The cartridge version was rereleased through AtariAge in 2013. In the same year, the Smithsonian American Art Museum added Halo 2600 to its \\"The Art of Video Games\\" exhibition.

It lives in the wet zone in western Sri Lanka around the former capital city of Colombo. The subspecies is generally gray- brown with lighter whiskers, a gray rump patch, and dark forearms and legs. Typical length is between excluding tail, with a tail. On average, males weigh and females weigh . Since 2004, it has been considered to be critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) due to an 80% decline in population over the previous 36 years, and the fact that the rate of population decrease is expected to continue unabated. In 2010, the western purple-faced langur was included in the list of The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates, published by the IUCN and other organizations. Reasons for the subspecies' critical endangerment are largely due to deforestation. Studies have estimated that 81% to over 90% of the subspecies' former range has been deforested. Deforestation harms the monkey in several ways. The western purple-faced langur is naturally folivorous, and its biology is specialized for a diet that consists primarily of leaves. With leaves less available, the monkey's diet consists largely of cultivated fruit taken from people's gardens. This has several detrimental impacts on the monkey - it may not be able to extract adequate nutrition from fruit which it is not biologically adapted to use as a primary food source and the food is only available seasonally, leaving inadequate nutrition outside of fruiting season. Since the western purple-faced langur is naturally arboreal, deforestation also impacts its activities besides eating. With less forest available, monkeys spend more time than is natural on the ground, exposing them to danger from domestic dogs and cars, and they also climb power lines, exposing them to danger of electrocution. Also, when the monkeys are on the ground, they are easier to capture for the pet trade. Hunting is also a concern. Hope for the subspecies continued survival comes from the fact that the largest forests that it currently inhabits are around important water reservoirs and thus less likely to be exploited for other purposes. Also the Sri Lanka Forest Department is undertaking a project to promote forest conservation.

It involves a young man, Nev, being filmed by his brother and friend, co-directors Ariel and Henry, as he builds a romantic relationship with a young woman on the social networking website Facebook. The film was a critical and commercial success. It led to an MTV reality TV series, Catfish: The TV Show. The film is credited with coining the term catfishing: a type of deceptive activity involving a person creating a fake social networking presence for nefarious purposes. Title In the film, the husband of the \\"catfish\\", Vince, relays a story of how, when live cod were shipped to Asia from North America, the fish's inactivity in their tanks resulted in only mushy flesh reaching the destination. However, fishermen found that putting catfish in the tanks with the cod kept them active, and thus ensured the quality of the fish. Vince then states that his wife Angela acts as a catfish, keeping the lives of those around her interesting. The title of the film is based on this dialogue, and is where the term \\"to catfish\\" is derived. Plot Young photographer Yaniv \\"Nev\\" Schulman lives with his brother Ariel in New York City. Abby Pierce, an 8-year-old child prodigy artist in rural Ishpeming, Michigan, sends Nev a painting of one of his photos. They become Facebook friends, which broadens to include Abby's family, including her mother Angela (Wesselman); Angela's husband Vince; and Abby's attractive older half-sister Megan, who lives in Gladstone, Michigan. For a documentary, Ariel and Henry Joost film Nev as he begins an online relationship with Megan. She sends him MP3s of song covers she performs for him, but Nev discovers that they are all taken from performances on YouTube. He later finds evidence that Angela and Abby have lied about other details of Abby's art career. Ariel urges Nev to continue the relationship for the documentary, although Nev seems reluctant to continue. The siblings decide to travel to Michigan in order to make an impromptu appearance at the Pierces' house and confront Megan directly. As they arrive at the house, Angela takes some time to answer the door, but is welcoming and seems happy to finally meet Nev in person. She also tells him that she has recently begun chemotherapy for uterine cancer. After leaving multiple messages while trying to call Megan, Angela drives Nev and Ariel to see Abby herself. While talking with Abby and her friend alone, Nev learns that Abby never sees her sister and rarely paints. The next morning, Nev wakes up to a text message from Megan saying that she has had a long- standing alcohol problem and has decided to check into rehab and cannot meet him, which is confirmed by one of Megan's Facebook friends, but Nev realizes that this is likely another lie from Angela. After meeting with the family back at their house, Angela admits that the pictures of Megan were of a family friend, that her daughter Megan really is in rehab downstate and that Angela had really painted each of the paintings that she had sent to Nev. Nev thus realizes that, while believing he was talking to Megan, it was really Angela posing as her with an alternate Facebook account and mobile phone. As he sits for a drawing, Angela confesses that the various Facebook profiles were all maintained by her, but that through her friendship with Nev, she had reconnected with the world of painting, which had been her passion before she sacrificed her career to marry Vince—who has two severely mentally disabled children who require constant care. Through a conversation with Vince himself, the siblings learn that Angela had told him (falsely) that Nev was paying for her paintings, and that he had encouraged her to seize the opportunity to have him as a patron. Vince, talking with Nev, tells the story about how live cod were shipped along with catfish in the same tanks to keep the cod active, and thus ensure the quality of the fish. He further explains this as a metaphor on how there are people in everyone's lives who keep them alert, active, and always thinking. It is implied that he believes Angela to be such a person. Some time after, Nev receives a package labeled as being from Angela herself; it is the completed drawing that she labored over during their meeting, although Nev seems ambivalent in his feelings about it. On-screen text then informs the viewer that Angela did not have cancer, there was no Megan at Dawn Farms, and she doesn't know the girl in the pictures. Over the course of their nine-month correspondence, Angela and Nev exchanged more than 1,500 messages. It was revealed later that the girl in the pictures was Aimee Gonzales, a professional model and photographer, who lives in Vancouver, Washington, with her husband and two children. In October 2008, two months after the events, Ronald, one of Vince's twin sons, has died. Angela deactivated her 15 other profiles and changed her Facebook profile to a picture of herself, and now has a website to promote herself as an artist. Nev is still on Facebook and has more than 732 friends, including Angela. Production Producer Marc Smerling and editor Zac Stuart-Pontier in 2018 To portray Megan and her family, Angela used pictures that Gonzales had posted on Facebook. The documentary's filmmakers compensated Gonzales for her involuntary appearance in Catfish, and she participated in publicity for the film. Authenticity Following the film's premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, a Q&A; session was abruptly ended, when an audience member suggested that Catfish may actually be a \\"faux- documentary\\". Ariel Schulman dismissed this opinion with the reply, \\"Oh, so you're saying that my brother is the best actor in the world? Let's hear it for my brother! The next Marlon Brando, ladies and gentlemen! Thank you very much! Oh, and we're the best writers in Hollywood? Thank you everyone!\\" After the screening, documentary-filmmaker Morgan Spurlock approached the film's producers and called Catfish \\"the best fake documentary\\" he had ever seen. The veracity of Angela Wesselman-Pierce's life, as presented in the film, is not in question and has been confirmed by independent news sources. A month after the film's theatrical release, Wesselman-Pierce was interviewed on ABC's 20/20, and the Los Angeles Times ran a profile on her. A year later, The Mining Journal revisited her story in a two-part profile, highlighting Wesselman-Pierce's involvement with the North of the 45th Parallel 2011 exhibition at the DeVos Art Museum on the campus of Northern Michigan University. Some journalists and film critics have cast doubt on the filmmakers' motivations. Kyle Buchanan of Movieline questions why the filmmakers would begin obsessively documenting Nev's online relationship so early on, and argues that it is highly improbable that media-savvy professionals like the Schulmans and Joost would not use the Internet to research Megan and her family before meeting them. Buchanan and others have suggested that the filmmakers likely discovered the fabrications in Wesselman- Pierce's story earlier than is presented in the film and pretended to be fooled only so that they could exploit her story for the documentary. Release The film had a limited release on September 17, 2010. The Rogue Pictures unit of Relativity Media acquired Catfish in a bidding war with Paramount Pictures, after Brett Ratner endorsed the film. Catfish was released on Blu-ray and DVD on January 4, 2011. MTV series The Schulmans teamed up with MTV to produce a reality television series similar to the idea of the documentary but which focuses on the lives of others who have been entangled in an online relationship with another person. It premiered on November 12, 2012. Reception The film was well received by critics; it has an 80% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the site's consensus being \\"Catfish may tread the line between real-life drama and crass exploitation a little too unsteadily for some viewers' tastes, but its timely premise and tightly wound mystery make for a gripping documentary\\". Time magazine did a full-page article, written by Mary Pols in a September 2010 issue, saying \\"as you watch Catfish, squirming in anticipation of the trouble that must lie ahead―why else would this be a movie?―you're likely to think this is the real face of social networking.\\"Pols, Mary. \\"Fish Tale\\", Time, New York, 2010-09-27. Retrieved on 2010-10-22. At the 2010 Sundance Film Festival, Alison Willmore of IFC described it as a \\"sad, unusual love story.\\"Willmore, Allison. \\"\\"Catfish,\\" a virtual romance. \\" IFC, 23 January 2010. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called Catfish \\"jaw-dropping\\" and \\"crowd-pleasing\\" but said that it \\"will require clever marketing in order to preserve the surprises at its core.\\"DeFore, John. \\"Catfish -- Film Review\\" The Hollywood Reporter, 28 January 2010. Kyle Buchanan of Movieline asked if \\"easily the most buzzed- about documentary\\" at Sundance had \\"a truth problem\\", and reported that an audience member questioned whether it was a documentary at all.Buchanan, Kyle. \\"Does Sundance Sensation Catfish Have a Truth Problem? \\" Movieline, 2010-01-29. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times referred to these questions as a \\"severe cross-examination\\" and that filmmakers \\"protested their innocence, and indeed everyone in the film is exactly as the film portrays them.\\"Ebert, Roger.\\"Catfish\\" Chicago Sun-Times, 22 September 2010. Total Film described the film as: \\"Funny, unsettling and thoroughly engrossing... the end result is a compulsive, propulsive study of relationships virtual and real\\". Lawsuits The film has been the subject of two lawsuits concerning songs used in the film without being attributed to their creators. Relativity Media has concluded that, due to these lawsuits, the film will never be profitable.

Photo: Bergens Tidende Conrad Baden (31 August 1908 – 11 June 1989) was a Norwegian organist, composer, music educator, and music critic.Biography of Conrad Baden He had an extensive production of orchestral works, chamber music, vocal works and church music. He is considered one of the most important Norwegian composers of the 20th century. Biography =Studies= He received his first music lessons from his organist father who died when Conrad was 17 years old and about to complete business school. He devoted himself to music and studied piano and organ with the local organist Daniel Hanssen. The young talent soon played to services and oratories. 19 years old, Baden was given organist position in Strømsgodset church. Instead of studying at the Music Conservatory in Oslo, he proceeded to a private exam as organist in 1931 and with excellent grades. In 1931-32 he studied church music at the Leipzig Conservatory and got strong impressions of the Bach tradition. Fellow students were later Nidaros cathedral organist Ludvig Nielsen and composer Geirr Tveitt. Coming home he studied counterpoint with Palestrina expert Per Steenberg and instrumentation and composition with the composer Bjarne Brustad. =Debut= In 1936 he gave his debut concert as an organist at the Oslo Cathedral. He eventually became known as an organist and composer of organ works, motets and hymns. During the 1950s Bden was a strong and radical voice amongst discussions concerning a departure from the late romantic style in favour of Lutheran and neobaroque style. In 1943 he changed his organist position to his father's old church Strømsø in Drammen. In 1946 he appeared as a professional composer in Oslo with a chamber music program. In 1961 he moved with wife and two sons to Oslo and a position in Ris church until 1975. This concluded serving as an organist during 47 years. =Work styles= Neoclassicism of the 1950s Baden’s earliest works were penned in a national-romantic style, while his church music works display a close bond to the prevalent Palestrina style of the period. His works from 1950 onwards, were heavily influenced by French Neo-classicism, and in the 60s Baden would also employ twelve-tone techniques, with an increasing use of dissonance. Spring 1965 saw Baden travelling to Vienna to meet Hanns Jelinek, a student of Schönberg and Berg – a visit that led to a stylistic liberation for the Norwegian composer. The following year, this liberation came into fruition in his sole twelve-tone work Hymnus per alto, flauto, oboe e viola with a text from the Latin hymn Vexilla Regis. A breakthrough as an orchestral composer came in 1955 with the performance of Symphony No. 1. A unique neoclassical work is the Fairytale Suite for Orchestra (1960), inspired by Norwegian traditional stories. Modernism In the 1960s, younger composers like Egil Hovland and Knut Nystedt pioneered a more radical tone language inspired by the twelve-tone technique. Baden had already in 1958 criticized \\"the gap between church music and concert music ..., a church ideal which, as time goes on, is increasingly distancing itself from the musical practice of the present\\". Baden was himself influenced by the increasing radicalization of contemporary music. He began to use themes from the twelve- tone technique, and with a bolder use of dissonances. The need for a new orientation led in 1965 to studies in Vienna with Hanns Jelinek, a student of the twelve-tone pioneers Arnold Schönberg and Alban Berg. Despite experiencing him as \\"a terrible calculator,\\" the visit contributed to a lasting stylistic liberation. =Composer= Baden composed works in a number of forms, bar opera and electronic music. As a composer, he was highly active. In addition to his vocation as a professional organist through 47 years, he composed a mass for soloists, choirs and orchestra, 200 songs for soloists and choirs, suites and sonatas for piano and other instruments, motets and 11 cantatas. In Baden’s compositional output, his church music occupies an equal role to that of his orchestral works – he would write five concertos and smaller orchestral works as well as six symphonies. In addition to his career in composition and as an organist, he taught counterpoint, harmony and composition at the Music Conservatory in Oslo. As a music critic, Baden’s reviews were featured in newspapers Drammens Tidende, Vårt Land and Morgenbladet. Compositions While holding positions as an organist, music critic and educator, he composed 146 works in most forms. Among his 20 orchestral works are solo concerts for clarinet, viola, piano, bassoon and cello, and he composed six symphonies 1952 - 1980. 2)3)4)5) Among choral works are a Mass (1949) with the classic Latin text and 11 cantatas for special occasions in cities and churches. Many Norwegian church choirs have sung some of his 45 motets for the service. Adaptations of Norwegian religious folk tones make up a large part of his numerous songs for choir and solo songs. His 35 chamber music and piano works include suites and sonatas, also for children. Among his 33 organ works, there are 11 variations on folk tunes and on chorales. In free organ works such as sonatas (the first in 1939) and suites for organ, the tone language moves parallel the development of contemporary music, from late romanticism through neoclassicism to expressionism. The suite Pezzi concertante (1966) is described by the organ performer Harald Herresthal as \\"expressive and almost volcanic emotional”. outburst\\" The more radical tone language of the 1960s is evident in the orchestral work Variazioni (1963). There he tries out the twelve-tone style, and this is most strongly expressed in Hymnus for song and three instruments (1966). Such a sonic liberation combined with classical forms characterized him for the rest of his life, through the latter half of his total sixty years of compositional work. He is described as a stylistically diverse composer. =Educator and critic= From 1947 he was a teacher in counterpoint, harmony and composition at the Music Conservatory in Oslo. After a transition of the conservatory in 1973 to the Norwegian Academy of Music he served as an associate professor until 1978. He was central to theory teaching for thirty years. Among his numerous students are Harald Herresthal, Trond Kverno and Ragnar Söderlind. Also students who wanted to compose differently than the traditional classical style, like Arne Nordheim and jazz musicians such as Jan Garbarek, had lessons in harmony and counterpoint (also called \\"Conrad point\\"!) with him. Even if being a serious educator, he was known for his humour. Composition professor Finn Mortensen puts it this way: “Behind the smoking pipe and the serious features it hides an ability for unique punchlines and an ability for whimsical humming with a dry-whitish cut.” He was a music critic in newspapers and magazines since 1935, and his commentaries give important response to Norwegian musical life through fifty years.

Origins The katarista movement began in the early 1970s, recovering a political identity of the Aymara people. The movement was centered on two key understandings, that the colonial legacy continued in the Latin American republics after independence and that the indigenous population constituted the demographic (and thus essentially, the political) majority in Bolivia. Katarismo stresses that the indigenous peoples of Bolivia suffer both from class oppression (in the Marxist, economic sense) and ethnic oppression.Sanjinés, p. 160 The agrarian reform of 1953 had enabled a group of Aymara youth to begin university studies in La Paz in the 1960s. In the city, this group faced prejudices, and katarista thoughts began to emerge among the students. The movement was inspired by the rhetoric of the national revolution as well as by Fausto Reinaga, writer and founder of the Indian Party of Bolivia.Sanjinés, p. 155 The group formed the Julian Apansa University Movement (MUJA), which organized around cultural demands, including bilingual education. Its most prominent leader was Jenaro Flores Santos (who in 1965 returned to the countryside to lead peasants). Another prominent figure was Raimundo Tambo.Stern, pp. 390-391 Emergence At the 1971 Sixth National Peasant Congress, the congress of the National Peasants Confederation, the kataristas emerged as a major faction against the pro- government forces.Stern, p. 394 The 1973 Tolata massacre (in which at least 13 Quechua peasants were killed) radicalized the katarista movement.Van Cott, p. 55 Following the massacre, the kataristas issued the 1973 Tiwanaku Manifesto, which viewed Quechua people as economically exploited and culturally and politically oppressed. In this vision, peasant class consciousness and Aymara and Quechua ethnic consciousness were complementary because capitalism and colonialism were the root of exploitation. Political recognition Katarismo made its political breakthrough in the late 1970s through the leading role kataristas played in CSUTCB. The kataristas pushed the CSUTCB to become more indigenized. Eventually, the kataristas split into two groups. The first, a more reformist strain, was led by Victor Hugo Cardenas, who later served as vice president under Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, heading efforts to institutionalize a neoliberal, state-led multiculturalism. A second strain articulated a path of Aymara nationalism. A political wing of the movement, the Tupaj Katari Revolutionary Movement (MRTK) was launched.Sanjinés, pp. 14-15 This radical stream of katarismo has been represented by Felipe Quispe (aka El Mallku), who took part in founding the Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army in the 1980s.Sanjinés, p. 163 This group later became the MIP (Indigenous Movement Pachakuti), which became outspoken critics of the neoliberal Washington Consensus and which coalesced around ethnic-based solidarity. Quispe advocated the creation of a new sovereign country, the Republic of Quillasuyo, named after one of the four regions of the old empire where the Incas conquered the Aymaras. Current Vice President of Bolivia Alvaro Garcia Linera was a member of this group. Decline Katarista organizations were weakened during the 1980s. In this context NGOs began to appropriate katarista symbols. Populist parties, such as CONDEPA, also began to integrate katarista symbols in their discourse.Van Cott, p. 84 After the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR) had incorporated katarista themes in its 1993 election campaign, other mainstream parties followed suit (most notably the Revolutionary Left Movement).Van Cott, p. 85 See also  * LAVAUD, Jean- Pierre.

It is endemic to southern California, where it is known from several of the local mountain ranges, including the San Bernardino, San Gabriel, and San Jacinto Mountains. It grows in rocky, forested habitat, sometimes in the alpine climates of the higher peaks. It is a perennial herb growing from a woody, branching caudex and taproot, sending up several decumbent or erect stems 10 to 40 centimetres tall. The oppositely arranged leaves line the stems, the largest ones located at the middle of each stem. Leaves are lance-shaped to nearly oval and up to 6 centimetres long. They are thick and leathery, and sometimes glandular and sticky. Each flower is encapsulated in a tubular calyx of fused sepals which may be nearly 3 centimetres long. It is greenish with ten veins and a coating of glandular hairs. The five petals are yellowish in colour and each has about six long, fringelike lobes at the tip.

The second son of Philibert de Rye (1540–1597), count of Varax and of La Roche-Saint- Hippolyte, baron of Balançon and of Romange, lord of Vuillefans, by his marriage to Claudine de Tournon-Roussillon, lady of Vassoulieu, Valançon was probably born at Bouligneux, Bresse. Serving in a Burgundian regiment under the orders of his elder brother Christophe, he took part in the siege of Ostende (1601–1604) where he lost a leg on 26 July 1601. Thereafter he wore a wooden leg. On 24 July 1602 his regiment was converted into a Tercio, and he succeeded his brother as \\"maestre de campo\\", thus becoming, although with interruptions, the commander of that unit for the next 23 years. In 1620 he participated in the invasion of the Palatinate and on 14 November 1620 took part in the defence of Alzey, where his Burgundian Tercio managed to repel every enemy attack until it was relieved by Count Hendrik van den Berg, a cavalry general in the Army of the Palatinate. Valançon was also present at the Battle of Fleurus (29 August 1622), the siege of Bergen op Zoom, and the siege of Breda (1624–25), of which city he became governor until 1631. That same year he was nominated Captain-General and Grand Master of Artillery in the Army of Flanders, replacing Hendrik van den Berg, who was now General of the Cavalry. In 1635 Valançon ravaged the French regions of Artois and Picardy, commanding Croatian troops. In 1636, with 2,000 horse and 10,000 foot soldiers, he repelled a Dutch force sent to storm Juliers and Cleves, thereafter relieving Schenck, besieged by the Dutch. Valançon kept his position in the Army until 1638, when he became a member of the War Council in Brussels. In 1645 he was designated to the post of Captain-General of Namur, living the last three years of his life in the castle of Namur, where he died in 1648. Bibliography * \\"Memorial histórico español.

On the morning of December 1, 1875, Swatara was anchored in a harbor of Pará, Brazil, when the ship's dinghy capsized. A strong tidal current swept the dinghy backwards from the side of the ship, where it had first capsized. One of the dinghy's crew initially grabbed onto the small boat, but then lost his grip and began to sink. Deneef jumped overboard from Swatara's gangway, swam to the drowning man, and dragged him back to the dinghy, where they were later picked up by a cutter.
