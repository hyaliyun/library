Biography Scarfoglio was born in Paganica, in the Abruzzi region of Italy, but lived and worked in Naples much of his life. As a writer of fiction, his early reputation rests on the novella The Trial of Phryne, published in 1884, a retelling‚Äîset in contemporary small-town Italy- of the trial of Phryne, a Greek courtesan from the fourth century, BCE. In Scarfoglio's version, a young woman, Mariantonia, guilty of murder, is acquitted simply because she is beautiful. Scarfoglio's tale is well known even to Italians who have not actually read the novella, since it was the basis for an episode in Alessandro Blasetti's popular 1952 film Altri tempi (Other Times), starring Gina Lollobrigida as Phryne/Mariantonia. As a journalist, Scarfoglio and his wife, Matilde Serao, the best-known woman writer in Italy at the time, founded a number of newspapers: Corriere di Roma, the Corriere di Napoli, the Ora of Palermo, and, the most prominent, Il Mattino in Naples, still the largest daily newspaper in the city. His name is chiefly associated with the latter paper, which he owned and edited for many years. He and his wife were responsible for moving Naples into the mainstream of Italian journalism in the early twentieth century by serializing the works of writers such as D'Annunzio. As an editorialist in his own paper, Scarfoglio supported such policies as Italian expansionism in Africa and the Aegean in the 1890s. He is the father of journalists Carlo Scarfoglio and Antonio Scarfoglio.

Nyonda served under the administration of the first Gabonese President L√©on M'ba, and was a prominent political figure in that administration. He served as Minister of Public Works from 1957 until 1962 and as Minister of Justice from 1963 to 1964. Following President L√©on Mba's sudden and suspicious death, Omar Bongo took over as head of state. Some suspect the involvement of the French government, determined to control this oil-rich nation. When Vincent de Paul Nyonda refused to join the new government, one he deemed illegitimate, Omar Bongo ordered his arrest. Nyonda endured weeks of torture, but a decision was made to spare his life. He was sent to a village and cut from his electoral base. In the small village of Mandji, away from the luxurious life that his social status had provided, he learnt to live a much simpler life. He built his house with the help of a few volunteers. He learn to hunt and grow vegetables to provide for his family. It is in Mandji that Nyonda developed a passion for writing. He wrote and produced a number of plays starring villagers turned stage actors. It is during one such performance that Mrs. Josephine Bongo, who was touring the province of Ngounie, had the opportunity see one of his plays. Upon returning to Libreville, she convinced her husband, President Omar Bongo, to allow Nyonda back to Libreville. Nyonda eventually returned to the capital. Rather than return to politics however, Nyonda chose to devote his life to his writing. He ultimately became a successful playwright and was dubbed, rightfully so, the \\"Father of the Gabonese Theater\\". Echoing Shakespeare, his favorite quote was: \\"Tout est th√©√¢tralit√©\\" (\\"life is a stage\\"). Nyonda died in Libreville, Gabon on 20 January 1995 at the age of 78. His autobiography Du villageois au minister, published by L'Harmattan of Paris in 1993, depicts his incredible life as a politician, a writer, and a family man.

He played college football at Florida State University from 2004 to 2008. High school career Weatherford attended Land O' Lakes High School in Pasco County, Florida. He led the Fighting Gators to a 32‚Äì14 (4‚Äì4 in the state playoffs) record in four years as the starting quarterback. Weatherford set both school and county records for season and career passing yards as well as touchdown passes. In his freshman season, Weatherford had the opportunity to play football with his older brother, Sam. The tandem played to a 7‚Äì3 regular-season record and traveled to Southlake High School for the playoffs. Andrew threw a touchdown to his tight end sibling in a losing effort. In the 2002 season, Weatherford had his most prolific stats, leading the state in passing touchdowns (ahead of future FSU backup Xavier Lee). His Gators won the second playoff game in school history against Ocala Vanguard. Weatherford did not throw an interception through eight games. This was the season he would set Pasco's single-season passing yardage record. Land O' Lakes would set school scoring records for points in a game (60) as well as points for a season (423). Weatherford guided his team to a perfect regular season, and two playoff wins. His season ended when they lost to eventual state champion Palm Bay High School, which featured future NFL players Reggie Nelson and Joe Cohen. The Palm Bay game was by far Weatherford's most struggling performance being sacked and intercepted four times (making the season total six). He finished the season with a 12‚Äì1 record. Coached by John Benedetto, Weatherford started every game of his high school career behind center. In his senior year he also started on defense as the team's safety. After a superb junior year, the Gators started the year with a state ranking of No. 5. They quickly fell from the state's elite when they lost the first two games of the season. While Weatherford put up modest numbers himself, the lack of another standout player and the loss of focus on the running game, the team finished 6-4. Weatherford and his team would gain composure in the playoffs defeating Auburndale and Ocala Forest. Drew Weatherford played his final game in a shootout with Lakeland Lake Gibson High School, losing to the Braves (who were led by USF's eventual star quarterback Matt Grothe), 44‚Äì35. College career =2005= After the career of Wyatt Sexton was cut short by Lyme disease, Weatherford won the starting job over fellow redshirt freshman Xavier Lee during fall practice. Weatherford, as a redshirt freshman, led the Seminoles to an Orange Bowl berth in 2005, but his #22 Seminoles lost to #3 Penn State in triple overtime. After that game, he underwent surgery for a torn tendon in his right ankle and healed fully. =2006= In the Spring of 2006, he won FSU camp awards for Most Dependable Quarterback and Top Offensive Leadership. Weatherford missed the Maryland game on October 28, 2006 due to injury, which gave Xavier Lee his shot at the starting job, escalating the quarterback controversy which had been hotly debated all season. Eventually Weatherford won the starting position over Lee. =2007= Virginia Tech Hokies Following FSU's Emerald Bowl victory against UCLA, a heated quarterback competition between Lee and Weatherford came to a resolution on August 23, 2007 when Weatherford was named the starter for the opener against Clemson. =2008= Weatherford sat out of spring practice after a slight tear in the lateral meniscus in his right knee required surgery. He was expected to be the starter headed into fall camp, but he faced fierce competition from redshirt sophomores D'Vontrey Richardson and Christian Ponder. On August 3, after two and half scrimmages, Jimbo Fisher, Florida State's quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator, announced that Christian Ponder would start the Seminoles' game against Western Carolina on September 6. Weatherford was moved down to third string on the depth chart and played in only one series late in the fourth quarter during FSU's 69-0 blowout of Western Carolina. He also split snaps with Richardson during FSU's 45-15 loss to the Florida Gators, as Ponder left the game at halftime after aggravating a back injury inflicted during FSU's 37-3 rout of Maryland. Professional career =2009= Weatherford was invited to participate in the Chicago Bears three-day mini camp. He also worked out with the New Orleans Saints and the New England Patriots. Weatherford participated in an open tryout on August 22 for the Orlando Tuskers of the newly formed United Football League. Following this tryout, Weatherford was film-interviewed by reporter Donnie Paschal.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ9j3RYblG8 =2010= In 2010, Weatherford played in the Arena Football League with the Tampa Bay Storm. He was the backup behind starting QB Brett Dietz, and was on kickoff coverage.

This token was issued in 1815 by Sir Isaac Coffin, who was granted the island by the British government in reward for his loyalty to the crown during the American Revolutionary War. While not a rare coin, it is hard to find in anything but worn condition, and even prices for pieces in the lowest grades tend to start at about at about C$100 and go up rapidly from there. History A portrait of Isaac Coffin (1759-1839) The Magdalen Islands (Fr. √éles de la Madeleine) form a small archipelago in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence with a land area of 205.53 square kilometers (79.36 sq mi). Though closer to Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, the islands form part of the Canadian province of Quebec. While there were boundary disputes between Labrador and Lower Canada over the islands, their inhabitants were largely French and the islands were transferred to Lower Canada by the Quebec Act of 1774.Willey p 94 Sir Isaac Coffin (16 May 1759 ‚Äì 23 July 1839) was an officer of the Royal Navy who served during the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. In 1787 he began operating in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and took a particular interest in the Magdalen Islands. He warned the governor's council that New Englanders were exploiting the fisheries in the gulf and were trading illegally with the inhabitants of these islands. Coffin, an American loyalist who had been deprived of his patrimony by the outcome of the War of Independence, was granted the islands in 1798 for his good service. Coffin planned to set up a feudal system on the Magdalen Islands, and he distributed the coins on the only occasion he visited the island.Willey p 94-95 His attempts to attract settlers or evict the squatters who had arrived from Saint Pierre and Miquelon were unsuccessful. The local populace resented his authoritarian ways, with the cry of \\"Fouettez King George and King Coffin!\\" (\\"Whip King George and King Coffin\\"), as he was leaving the island.Kleeberg p 35 While it has been said that the penny token was little used by the islanders, the tokens were clearly well-circulated as few examples are available in higher grades.Willey p 95 Evidently many were shipped to Nova Scotia, as contemporary newspaper articles from that time mention them as circulating among the merchants in Halifax. Design One of the rights claimed by Coffin was the right to coin money, and he ordered the minting of pennies by Edward Thomason of Birmingham, from a design possibly made by the engraver Thomas Halliday, who is known to have worked with Thomason at this time.Kleeberg p 37 The obverse of the coin depicts a seal on an ice floe. It is inscribed 'MAGDALEN ISLAND TOKEN' with date '1815' appearing at the bottom. The reverse of the coin depicts a filleted cod and its inscription says 'SUCCESS TO THE FISHERIES', followed by the denomination of 'ONE PENNY'. The cod and the inscription on the reverse refers to the fishing industry that was essential to the islands' economy. Numismatic Study An example of the Magdalen Island penny token is first mentioned in a catalog compiled by Thomas Sharp of the collection of Sir George Chetwynd.Kleeberg p 36 Sharp described the token's edge as \\"engrailed- Halliday\\", mentioning the name of Thomas Halliday, who is thought to have to created the dies for the token. It is also mentioned in the third volume of Josef Neumann's extensive survey of copper coinage published in 1863.Neumann p 175 Canadian numismatist R. W. McLachlan wrote about the Magdalen Island penny token in his Canadian Numismatics in 1886, saying \\"of its history I have not been able to learn anything, but believe it was imported by some of the large fish dealers for change, which at that time was scarce on the islands.\\"McLachlan1886 p 8 He returned to this subject in a later article published in \\"The Canadian Antiquarian and Numismatic Journal\\", where he discovered that the production of the token was described in the memoirs of Sir Edward Thomason, who said that he undertook the following work during 1815: > I had manufactured this year a large quantity of tokens for Admiral Sir > Isaac Coffin, Bart., who is the sole possessor and king, as he called > himself, of the Magdalen islands, situated in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, in > North America. They were principally of copper, pence and half-pence. ...as > soon as a large quantity of these were struck off, Sir Isaac sailed off with > them, packed up in casks, and took with him a powerful coining press and > machinery, and dies ready engraved, to establish what he called a little > mint for his subjects, to manufacture their coin for the future...Thomason p > 75 McLachlan noted that no specimen of this half-pence token described by Thomason had come to light, and suggested that Thomason mis-remembered having struck them for Isaac.McLachlanAntiquarian p 80 McLachlan further speculated that Coffin was in a hurry, and sent the dies for the half penny along with the minting press with the intention of minting that token on the island, and that the coining press and dies for that other token were never used. There are no known extant examples of the half penny Magdalen token, but a recent survey of numismatic sales relating to this token found a catalog sale from 1871 that mentioned two examples of the half penny (not illustrated), both listed in \\"Fine\\" condition. These two examples have not subsequently resurfaced, and it is worth noting the sale catalog was criticized the following year in an American coin collector's magazine for its extensive typographical errors. Canadian numismatist Pierre-Napol√©on Breton illustrated the penny token in his book Illustrated History of Coins and Tokens Relating to Canada (1890), placing it first among the Quebec series of tokens, and numbering it as 520 in his catalog.Breton1894 p. 36 In this book he also mentions its origins with Sir Isaac Coffin, and says that the coins were chiefly distributed on the island \\"by way of loans among the chief men in the Islands\\". He gave its rarity (on a 10-point scale, with \\"10\\" being the rarest), as 2¬Ω. More modern studies of the token find that it is rare in Fine condition or better,Kleeberg p 40 and that uncirculated business strikes are rarer than the few proofs that were minted. It is thought that the tokens were produced from a single set of dies, with some of the proof specimens showing signs of having been recut. Notes Bibliography   * References Coins of Canada by J.A.

Early life and education Schott was born to a Roman Catholic family in Santa Clara, California in 1939. His father was a part-time professor at the Santa Clara University and then worked as an engineer in the public works department for the city of Santa Clara.Horatio Alger Association: \\"Stephen C. Schott\\" retrieved October 12, 2014 As a youth, Schott worked in the local fruit orchards and sold prunes from the trees on his father's property. At the age of 16, he began working on road survey crews. He attended the Bellarmine College Preparatory School and then, after qualifying on a partial baseball scholarship, graduated in 1960 from Santa Clara University with a degree in business and management. Both schools now bear buildings in his name (see Stephen Schott Stadium). After school, he joined the Army, and then when he completed his service, he took an accounting job with Ford Motor Company in Milpitas, California. After one year, he took a job with a home builder. Career In 1977, he and several partners formed Citation Builders, a real- estate and residence-development company; in 1988 he bought out his partners' shares, reformed the company as a family-run business, Citation Homes Central, and moved it to Santa Clara, California. Despite employing fewer than 25 people, Citation is now one of the largest homebuilders in the state of California, and has been responsible for the construction of over 50,000 individual residences. =Ownership of the Oakland Athletics= In 1995, he and partner Ken Hofmann purchased the Oakland Athletics from the Walter A. Haas, Jr. estate. Under their patronage, general manager Billy Beane's novel management and player-procurement strategies allowed the A's, though a \\"small- market\\" club, to make the post-season playoffs despite being restricted by financially limited budgets. Beane's approach to obtaining success within Schott's constraints was documented in Michael Lewis's book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game. Schott and Hofmann sold the A's to a group of Los Angeles real estate developers headed by Lewis Wolff, in 2005. =Life and career after Major League Baseball= In 2003, Santa Clara University began to develop plans to build a new baseball field, allowing their nationally recognized soccer team unrestricted access to pre-existing Buck Shaw Stadium. The project floundered under lack of funds until Schott donated USD $4 million, over half the stadium's total cost. The resulting facility‚Äîthe Stephen Schott Stadium ‚Äî opened April 30, 2005, with a game against Gonzaga University.

Post-romanticism in music  Post-romanticism in music refers to late romantic composers who used forms that were found typically in the Classical and Baroque eras while still retaining aspects of the Romantic era. Among the best-known post- romantic composers are Giacomo Puccini and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Some other composers like Richard Strauss and Gustav Mahler were transitional composers who wrote classical symphonies, operas, and songs in a post-romantic style that constituted a blend of late romantic and early modernist musical languages. Arthur Berger described the mysticism of La Jeune France as post- Romanticism rather than neo-Romanticism.Virgil Thomson,.

Description The body of C. lawderanus is rather slender and elongate, depressed, and covered above with numerous granules intermixed with small roundish tubercles. The upper side of the head is equally granular, with the granular scales being somewhat larger on the snout. The rostral area is large, and broad, with the nostril pierced between the rostral, the first labial, and two nasals. It has 9 upper and 8 lower labials. The mental area is triangular, partially wedged in between two elongate chin-shields, forming a suture below it. Each of the chin-shields is followed along the labials by three other somewhat rounded shields. the ear-opening is small and rounded. Ventral scales are small. Two pairs of preanal pores occur in the male, are close together, and form an angle. General colour above is greyish brown, very densely marbled and spotted with dark brown, with some indistinct undulating, whitish cross bands on the body, and margined on the anterior edges with blackish brown. A somewhat indistinct dark band runs from the nostril through the eye to the ear. The front and hind edges of the eye white 5 labials are spotted and speckled with brown. Below is whitish.

Described from a single specimen in 1877, it was rediscovered in 2010 in the Eastern Ghats of Odisha state, India. Discovery and rediscovery The species was described in 1877 by then Lt Col Richard Henry Beddome of the Madras Presidency Army, from a single male specimen obtained from the woods on \\"Patinghe hill\\" in the Jeypore forests of present-day Odisha, at an altitude of . The holotype is deposited as BNHM 82.5.22.37 in the Natural History Museum (earlier British Museum of natural history). In 2009, Ishan Aggarwal, a doctoral student at the Centre for Ecological Sciences, Indian Institute of Sciences, Bangalore, started working on the genus Geckoella. He hoped to rediscover this \\"lost\\" species as it would help piece together the evolutionary history of the genus. The search began with piecing together the route of Beddome's explorations in the Eastern Ghats. After many months of research, the CES and the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) put together expeditions in high elevation areas of the Eastern Ghats in southern Odisha in September 2010 and northern Andhra Pradesh in November 2011. A sub-adult male lizard was collected on 20 September 2010 in Koraput district, Odisha, by Ishan Agarwal and Aniruddha Datta-Roy of CES which was deposited in the collection of the BNHS. A second specimen, an adult male, was recorded on 9 October 2011 from Galikonda, Visakhapatnam district, Andhra Pradesh extending its known distribution range. Description Description of type, male specimen, collected in Jeypore by Beddome in 1877: Measurements : * Total length : * Head : * Width of body : * Body : * Forelimb : * Hindlimb : * Tail : Distribution The lizard appears to inhabit semi-evergreen forests in high elevation areas (> ) of the Eastern Ghats of southern Odisha and northern Andhra Pradesh. However, the areas where the lizard has been found are under tremendous pressure from deforestation and mining. The taxon is surmised to possibly be a wet-zone relict stranded by the aridification of peninsular India.

Opened in 1973, the club is located at 6th Street and Harrison in the South of Market district. Known for its status as an afterhours club, the venue has hosted a variety of benefits and events during its time as part of San Francisco's nightlife community. History The nightclub's only location has been the site of a former 22-room hotel at the corner of 6th and Harrison. The club has gone through several periods of ownership during its time, the majority of it spent under three brothers from the Hanken family. =Al Hanken era (19731989)= The EndUp opened on November 15, 1973 as a differentiated version of the RoundUp, owner Al Hanken's LGBT country western-themed venue located one block north of the EndUp at 298 6th Street and Folsom. Mister Marcus, a writer for San Francisco's monthly LGBT magazine Kalendar, described the EndUp's opening in his column Man About Town: > The long-awaited EndUp opened last Thursday too and you have to see it to > believe it. I was lucky to get a demonstration of their quadraphonic sound > system long ago. It's a big dance bar and certainly will add to the ambiance > of Harrison Street. Congratulations to Al Hanken and Greg Loughner on their > latest \\"baby\\". One of the events held at the club during this era was the Jockey Short Dance Contest (19741978). Taking its name from the type of underwear, the contest was a common event in San Francisco gay clubs during the mid-1970s. Al Hanken believed strong incentives like the contest were necessary to bring patrons to the EndUp's South of Market district from the Castro district, some away, as the bars there were already featuring their own versions. Randy Johnson served as emcee of the EndUp's Sunday afternoon contest along with DJs Steve Newman, Peter D. Struve, and Rod Kimbel. Offering first and second-place winners $150 and $50 respectively, the EndUp's contest gained wider notice when it was featured in the weekly serialized newspaper column Tales of the City and later in the novels of the same name by San Francisco author Armistead Maupin. When the EndUp's sister club the RoundUp closed in 1977, Al Hanken's focus went towards developing the EndUp's burgeoning DJ talent. DJs Steve Fabus and Patrick Cowley hosted the recurring event Church (19791982) which started at 6:00a.m. to accommodate patrons who had just left the Trocadero Transfer nightclub. Patrick Cowley also hosted an event called Menergy (19811982) until his death in 1982. =Helmut Hanken era (19891996)= Al Hanken died in 1989, leaving the club to his brother, Helmut Hanken. During this era, events such as Club Uranus (19891992) created by DJs Lewis Walden and Michael Blue featured a community of artists performing as art dancers and drag queens, celebrating creative energies through go-go dancing. The show featured co-host Jerome Caja and a cast of drag performance artists such as Trauma Flintstone, Diet Popstitute, Steven Maxxine, Tony Vaguely, Kitty Litter, Pussy Tourette and Elvis Herselvis. Running concurrent to this was Klub Dekadence (19911993) on Friday nights with DJ Bugie. Helmut Hanken died four years after inheriting the club from his brother. The last will and testament of Helmut Hanken named the EndUp's operational manager, Douglas Carl Whitmore, as executor of his estate. From the position of executorial trustee, Whitmore was able to influence operations at the club more directly and with less oversight than would normally be the case with managers. During this period of time the EndUp experienced numerous internal difficulties involving financial and employee turmoil, with the club eventually filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1995 and its employees seeking to unionize themselves in response to what they perceived were threats to their job security. Those who attempted to join together in a union were dismissed from working, and many of these employees then began picketing the EndUp in protest. With the assistance of the Queer Victory Labor Fund the venue reached a monetary settlement to end the dispute. Pointing to Whitmore's management of the club as the cause of its difficulties, a third Hanken brother, Carl, began legal proceedings in Marin County to have Whitmore removed as executor of Helmut Hanken's estate, whereupon a brief interregnum of court-disputed ownership for the club began. In April 1996, Marin Superior Court commissioner Mary Grove ended the dispute by terminating Whitmore's executorship, saying he had \\"mismanaged the estate, wasted the estate's assets (and) wrongfully neglected the estate.\\" With a new executor in control, Helmut Hanken's estate immediately sold the club to Carl Hanken. Having lost control of the venue, Whitmore confronted Carl Hanken at the latter's Kentfield residence on July 24, 1996. After chasing Hanken out of his house at gunpoint, Whitmore shot Hanken in the back. Whitmore then fled the scene, and a two-week long manhunt ensued, ending with Whitmore committing suicide amidst police efforts to apprehend him after a standoff in Millbrae. Carl Hanken subsequently recovered from his injuries. =Carl Hanken era (19962005)= In contrast with the internal challenges seen during the previous era, the era under Carl Hanken experienced outside challenges, including San Francisco Police Department commander Dennis Martel's vice squad and their attempts at closing or curtailing nightclub venues in the South of Market district. Events such as Fag Fridays (19962008) featuring DJ David Harness, saw expansion of the club's operating hours. Opening at 11:00p.m. Friday evenings until 6:00a.m. Saturdays, Fag Fridays combination of patrons from the LGBT and straight-friendly communities as well as its unconventional business hours were rare among Bay area nightclubs at the time. By the end of this era the EndUp's longest running continual event was its Sunday morning tea dance, an event which had been occurring in one form or another and produced completely in-house, since 1979. =Leung era (20052012)= In August 2005 the club was sold by Carl Hanken to a group of six investors headed by Bay Area attorney Sydney Leung. These new owners kept intact the club's affinity for gay disco and underground house music. Those styles, along with reggae, mash-ups, breakbeat, techno, tech house, electro house, minimal techno and microhouse continued to attract top-tier DJ's from around the world, including Derrick Carter, Doc Martin, Mark Farina, Miguel Migs, Tommy Sunshine, Ellen Ferrato, DJ Sneak and Josh Wink. In 2009 the club received industry recognition with the awards \\"Best DJs\\", \\"Best Dance Club\\", and \\"Best Outdoor Bar\\". =Stiener era (2012present)= After undertaking renovations in 2011 and other improvements to ensure the EndUp's legacy and its brand, Sydney Leung and four of his partners sold their shares in the venue to their business partner Ynez Stiener. Stiener had previously been part owner and managing director of the EndUp. Events during this period include Sunrise Sunday featuring DJs Mauricio Aviles, Gene Hunt, Ruben Mancias, Julius Papp, Miguel Migs, Norm Stradley, Jay-J, and Franky Boissy. The venue in this era has moved beyond its core focus upon the LGBT community to embrace a wider mix of clientele. 2016 deaths In 2016, two separate incidents of violence involving club patrons occurred in or just outside of the EndUp. In the first incident on June 5, 2016, officers responding to the sound of gunshots entered the EndUp around 2:00a.m. after witnessing several people hurriedly exiting the building. Inside, police found 19-year-old Sean Ford suffering from gunshot wounds. Ford was taken to a hospital where he died. Two suspects were initially arrested and charged, but the charges were later dropped for lack of evidence. Four months later on October 2, 2016, an argument which began inside of the EndUp became physical once it moved outside the club. 26-year-old John Sanyaolu, accompanied by his friends and relatives who had joined him at the club, was shot along with two of his relatives. Sanyaolu died of his injuries after his assailants fled the scene.

His emphasis on the identification of free-flying birds by field marks became widely adopted by professionals and amateurs. Many called him \\"Dean of the Birdwatchers.\\" Early life and family Griscom was born in New York City, the son of Clement Acton Griscom Jr. and Genevieve Sprigg Ludlow. Ludlow's grandfather Clement Acton Griscom Sr. was a prominent merchant and shipping executive. His maternal grandfather, William Ludlow, distinguished himself through military service. Griscom's family traces its ancestry back to Thomas Lloyd, a 17th-century physician in Pennsylvania. The oldest of three children, Ludlow Griscom had a sister, Joyce, who died in childhood, and a brother, Acton. As a boy, Ludlow's interest in birds showed itself as early as 1898. In 1907, he found fellow nature enthusiasts when he joined the Linnaean Society of New York. Griscom received an A.B. degree, with a major in pre-law, from Columbia University in 1912. Despite initial resistance on the part of his parents, he entered Cornell University as a graduate student of ornithology, studying under Arthur A. Allen. Louis Agassiz Fuertes was one of his neighbors, and they became good friends. Griscom's master's thesis dealt with field identification of ducks of the eastern United States, and he received his A.M. degree from Cornell in 1915. He taught there and at the University of Virginia, and continued to study toward a doctorate. However, financial pressures prevented him from completing that degree, even though his father ultimately consented to his career choice. Griscom married Edith Sumner Sloan on September 14, 1926; the couple had three children, Edith Rapallo, Andrew, and Joan Ludlow. Griscom was an enthusiastic opera- and concert-goer and accomplished pianist. Career =Museum work= In 1916, Griscom joined the staff of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York, initially in the ichthyology department where he co-authored one paper on fishes with John Treadwell Nichols. He transferred to the Department of Mammalogy and Ornithology the following year, where he worked for Frank Chapman, Curator of Birds. Early on, Griscom had looked to Chapman for career advice, but over time, relations between the two became strained. Blocked for further promotion, Griscom left his position as assistant curator of ornithology in 1927. That same year, Griscom moved to Boston to become Research Curator of Zoology at Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), where he proved to be an effective and hard-working administrator in addition to his scientific contributions. He worked closely with Thomas Barbour, the museum's director, with whom he had a warm relationship; after Barbour's death in 1946, Griscom reported to the new director, Alfred Romer. Griscom was named Research Ornithologist in 1948. However, Griscom's age and declining health, beginning with a stroke in 1950, led to his retirement in 1955. =Professional organizations and related work= Griscom maintained a high level of activity in several professional organizations. He joined the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) in 1908 and was named a fellow in 1925. As the organization shifted focus from museum collections to the study of live birds, he contributed his opinions and talents to its transition. He was elected to the Finance Committee in 1934 and later served on the Council, a subcommittee for faunistics, and other committees. Griscom's participation in the AOU was not without friction. At times, he was critical of certain AOU ways and means that he found old- fashioned, in particular the workings of the Check-List Committee; the committee in the 1940s included Alexander Wetmore and James Lee Peters. Peters, who was also Griscom's colleague at the MCZ, was in many ways the antithesis of Griscom: quietly working in the museum while Griscom attracted attention with his rapid field identifications. Once in Boston, in 1927, Griscom joined the Nuttall Ornithological Club, a limited-membership group of ornithologists that was in certain respects a predecessor of the AOU. He was elected treasurer in 1930 (succeeding Charles Foster Batchelder), was subsequently named a member of the council, and served a term as president from 1952. He gave nearly 50 talks at the club's regularly scheduled meetings on his various field trips and on local bird distribution and migration. As at the AOU, he emphasized identification of birds by field marks rather than in the hand, and the organization's meeting minutes expanded to accommodate his notes of recent sightings. Also in 1927, Griscom became an associate member of the New England Museum of Natural History, which was sponsored by the Boston Society of Natural History. He became chair of the Society's Budget Committee in 1937 and went on to assume more administrative and financial responsibilities. By the 1940s, the museum was in financial difficulty, and Griscom (now on the board of trustees) worked with new director Bradford Washburn to right the ship. In a controversial move, Griscom organized the sale of a portion of the Society's books (many of which were duplicated within the Boston area), with much of the library going to the University of Southern California. As the decade ended, Washburn and Griscom perceived the need to expand the museum's attendance. They reorganized the institution as the Boston Museum of Science, and with Griscom as president, the new museum opened its doors in 1951. On the national scene, Griscom became an important member of the National Audubon Society (NAS) in both an editorial and executive capacity. He was a contributing editor to Audubon Magazine and an associate editor of Audubon Field Notes. He joined the board of directors, then became its chairman in 1944, a position he held until 1956. During this period, he worked to refine and moderate the organization's focus on conservation issues as it broadened its membership base. Closer to home, Griscom was active with the Massachusetts Audubon Society (Mass Audubon), contributing articles, book reviews, and observational reports to its Bulletin. He served as a Director of the organization for nine years. =Field ornithology and birding= Griscom's field work included extensive travel across the United States and several expeditions to Central and South America. For the AMNH, he worked in Nicaragua in 1917. In 1923, he explored Quebec's Gasp√© Peninsula, collecting botanical specimens as well as observing birds. He led an expedition to Panama in 1924; members of the party described fifteen new species of birds while he himself published descriptions of the yellow-green brushfinch and the Tacarcuna bush- tanager. In 1925, Griscom was part of a team led by Gregory Mason and Herbert Spinden that collected specimens for the AMNH in British Honduras, the Yucatan Peninsula, and Cozumel Island. With Maunsell Crosby, he visited the Pearl Islands off Panama in 1927 and Guatemala in 1930. Griscom named two new species as a result of the Guatemala trip, the flightless Atitl√°n grebe (now extinct) and (with Jonathan Dwight) the belted flycatcher. Ludlow Griscom helped to establish the now widely held view that birds can be reliably identified \\"in the field\\" by looking at field marks (distinctive plumages, behaviors, etc., that are discernible from far away) rather than \\"in the hand\\" (for example, by trapping or killing). The story is told that, as a young birder of about twenty, he impressed senior ornithologists by identifying a female Cape May warbler visually, this judgment later confirmed by shooting the bird. Griscom's and his talent led the science away from using shotguns to using binoculars. Whether or not the story of the warbler is entirely true, Griscom was indeed skilled at quickly identifying birds by sight, using diagnostic features first learned from his museum work, and he influenced on other birders and ornithologists to use the same techniques. Later in his career, he wrote, :[What] people are now able to do in the way of instantly recognizing a large number of birds by song, notes, tricks of flight, shape, etc, entirely apart from their colors, seems perfectly fabulous to the uninitiated and was flatly declared to be impossible a generation ago.... The battle for sight records and field identification of the living bird has been won, so far as I know, and there is no real quarrel left about what birds can be recognized alive and when this recognition can be used in scientific research. This is not to say that Griscom never collected specimens, as he certainly did so on his Latin American expeditions. In the U.S., he estimated that he collected one bird per year between 1928 and 1945, and he held a permit for scientific collecting until 1955. Nor did Griscom accept sight records uncritically, viewing himself as a moderate in this respect. While he encouraged amateurs to pursue birding as a sport, he considered many nonprofessionals' published accounts of sightings to be so much clutter in the scientific literature. In his Birds of the New York City Region (1923), he used only those sight records that he considered reliable, and he made the fine distinction between merely reporting an observation and accepting it as a record. Ludlow Griscom is best remembered, however, for his eager participation in and promotion of the rising practice of birding by eye and ear, of watching birds as a sport. His first Christmas Bird Count was in 1908, and he organized counts in the Boston area. He kept personal life and year lists: his North America species total through 1939 was 640. But his particular passion was for Big Days, a friendly competition in which a team of birders traverses a region, intending to find and identify as many bird species as possible in a 24-hour period. An excellent one-day count for Griscom in coastal Massachusetts was 160 species. Griscom's Birds of the New York City Region and his works on the faunistics of Massachusetts birds were some of the first books in a new genre: birdfinding guides rather than identification guides. Working from a growing volume of sightings by skilled observers, Griscom provided in these books the details of exactly where a bird could be found in a region (for instance, a specific park or beach), at what time of year (in spring migration, for example), and in what numbers. In preparing these works, Griscom drew in part on his own records. From 1907 until the end of his life, Griscom transcribed his field notes made during trips in the United States and overseas into a set of large ledger books. He recorded identification details of each bird species, estimated numbers of birds, observed behaviors, and made note of weather conditions. The collected sixteen volumes of these ledgers are in the collection of the Peabody Essex Museum. In the field, Griscom is remembered by friends and students for his virtuosity in identification, his enthusiasm and brusque sense of humor, and his great satisfaction in teaching others the pleasures of birding. Probably his most illustrious field trip companion was President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who accompanied Griscom on a trip through Dutchess County, New York, in 1942. =Prot√©g√©s= It can be argued that Ludlow Griscom's single most important contribution to ornithology and conservation was his influence on Roger Tory Peterson, leading to the first edition of Peterson's Field Guide to the Birds in 1934. Griscom tested Peterson's paintings for the book's publisher, Houghton Mifflin, demonstrating that the renderings provided the right details that could be used to identify birds in the field. Peterson himself wrote that his field guides were \\"profoundly influenced\\" by Griscom's teaching. During his New York years, Griscom became a teacher to a group known as the Bronx County Bird Club, whose members included Peterson, Allan Cruickshank, and Joseph J. Hickey. In his time at Harvard, he was freshman advisor to Chandler Robbins. Ludlow Griscom was also a mentor to Allen Morgan, a fellow director of Massachusetts Audubon Society. =Botany= A complementary field of interest for Griscom was botany. In the early 1920s, he visited Newfoundland and Quebec on several expeditions, mostly under the direction of Merritt Lyndon Fernald. He had some 40,000 sheets of pressed plants in his own herbarium and the Gray Herbarium at Harvard. =Hunting= Ludlow Griscom also enjoyed duck hunting as a sport. As in other areas, his opinions about managing game birds were moderate. He wrote favorably about game management practices in Great Britain; suggested reducing the issuance of non-resident hunting licenses; and argued for a closed season for ducks for a limited period of time, lest the birds become non-migrant and poor game. =Conservation= From his position as an eminent ornithologist and officer of organizations like NAS, Griscom was an activist on behalf of conservation issues, especially those that affected coastal Massachusetts and the Atlantic flyway. He emphasized habitat preservation (of both breeding and wintering ranges) and public education, so that conservationists, sportsmen, voters, and policymakers alike could make informed decisions; he followed a path of moderation and compromise. In 1923, he argued against a measure to promote hunting on Martha's Vineyard that would have stressed populations of the ultimately doomed heath hen. In the 1940s, he lobbied government officials, among them his friend Ira N. Gabrielson, in support of federal conservation of habitat. In particular, he argued for protection of two natural areas that would become Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge and Parker River National Wildlife Refuge, which covers most of the barrier island of Plum Island. Later life and death Grave marker for Ludlow and Edith Sloan Griscom, framed by Hinoki False Cypress, Mount Auburn Cemetery, Massachusetts.Grave marker for Ludlow and Edith Sloan Griscom (reverse), Mount Auburn Cemetery, Massachusetts.Ludlow Griscom had his first stroke in 1950, beginning a decade of failing health. He retired from Harvard and the MCZ in 1955. As a courtesy, and in recognition of his many years of service, he was elected President of the AOU in 1956; he immediately resigned and was succeeded by Ernst Mayr. Despite suffering additional strokes, Griscom continued to watch birds and record his observations, making his last journal entry on May 14, 1959. On May 28, he died in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Griscom is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery. Recognition Ludlow Griscom was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He received the Conservation Medal from the National Audubon Society in 1956, and in that same year he was named an honorary president of the organization. Mass Audubon named the research station at its Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary for him. At Parker River National Wildlife Refuge, the \\"Dean of the Birdwatchers\\" is remembered by a bronze plaque mounted on a five-ton granite boulder near Hellcat Swamp. In 1980, the American Birding Association established the Ludlow Griscom Award in his honor.

Gameplay It depicts a corps-level hypothetical invasion of North America by a coalition of three invaders: The European Socialist Coalition (ESC) staging their invasion from Cuba, the South American Union (SAU) invading from Colombia, and the Pan Asiatic League (PAL) invading along the Pacific coast. Defending North America is a coalition of the United States and Canada, with Central America and Mexico having been annexed earlier in the alternate history timeline. It can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players. The game is played on a a hex map of North America in which each 'hex' is approximately from side to side. Distinctive color and symbology is used to represent which of the nine different terrain types dominates the hex. There is additional symbology for ports, supply sources, resource centers and amphibious landing zones. There are also map features along the hexsides including rivers, borders, and other boundaries. Both movement and combat are affected by terrain. There are 393 1/2-inch cardboard pieces (unit counters) representing the land, air, and naval military and logistics units of each combatant. The unit counters have numerical combat and movement ratings. Land and Air units are double-sided with their actual combat values on one side, and a question mark on the other side to indicate the unit's \\"untried\\" status, making it the first game to have this feature. Units are initially deployed as untried, and only when they are committed to combat is their true strength revealed. On each turn players may move all, some or none of their units through a number of hexes equal to or less than its movement rating allows. After movement is completed units that are adjacent to enemy units may engage in combat. Combat strengths are totaled for all participating units on each side and the relative strengths are expressed as a simplified odds ratio. A 6-sided die is rolled and the appropriate odds column is consulted to determine the combat result. Combat may result in retreats and/or losses to attacker, defender or both. Invasion: America includes six different scenarios lasting 8 turns and a campaign game of 60 turns. Each turn of the game represents one month. Scenario instructions define each side's order of battle and initial deployment, their unit replacement rates and victory conditions. Victory is determined by control of urban, supply and resource hexes that yield victory points. Publication history Invasion: America was a popular game for SPI and led to a larger, more complicated sequel in 1978, Objective Moscow, which explores a scenario where the Soviet Union is invaded either by NATO or by a coalition consisting of the United States, a unified Europe, China, and Iran. Reception Tony Van Lien reviewed Invasion: America in The Space Gamer No. 16. Van Lien commented that \\"For those of us who are into holocaust, Invasion: America, by Simulations Publications Inc. is the game we've been waiting for.\\" Eric Goldberg reviewed Invasion: America in Ares Magazine #1, rating it a 6 out of 9. Goldberg commented that \\"There are serious problems in the scenario victory conditions and some of the miscellaneous rules; the game is not one this writer would play more than once. There was enough interest in the system, however, to do a game in which the Soviet Union got the same treatment (Objective: Moscow).\\" See also * Fortress America - a plastic figure and area movement wargame with a similar scenario.

Life In 1478, his father Bagrat VI died and Alexander became king of Georgia, initially ruling its two major regions, Imereti in the west and Kartli in the east. Alexander was expelled from the kingdom by a rival prince Constantine II. Alexander retired to the mountainous western provinces of Racha and Lechkhumi. Alexander recovered Imereti after Constantine‚Äôs defeat at the hands of Qvarqvare II Jaqeli, a powerful atabeg of Samtskhe, in 1483, but lost the capital Kutaisi to Constantine again a year later. In 1488, Alexander took advantage of the Ak Koyunlu Turkoman invasion of Kartli, and seized control of Imereti. In 1491, Constantine had to recognise his rival as independent sovereign, and to confine himself to the government of Kartli. Peace between the two Georgian kingdoms did not last long, and in August 1509, Alexander invaded Kartli, taking its western regions as well as the fort-city of Gori. News that Imereti had been raided by the Ottomans during Alexander's absence made the king to return to Kutaisi, and Gori was soon taken back by David X of Kartli.

The L-3 series were adapted from Aeronca's pre-war Tandem Trainer and Chief models. Design and development In 1941, the United States Army Air Corps ordered four examples of the Aeronca 65 TC Defender, designated YO-58, for evaluation of the suitability of light aircraft for observation and liaison purposes. (It also placed similar orders with Piper and Taylorcraft Aircraft). Service tests during the US Army's annual maneuvers proved successful, and resulted in large orders being placed. In 1942, the O-58 was redesignated L-3.Swanborough and Bowers 1963, p. 31.Mondey 1996, p. 8. When American forces went into combat after Pearl Harbor, the Army Air Force used the L-3 in much the same manner as observation balloons were used during World War I‚Äîspotting activities and directing artillery fire. It was also used for liaison and transport duties and short-range reconnaissance which required airplanes to land and take off in short distances from unprepared landing strips. Liaison pilots would train on L-3s before moving on to front-line aircraft like the Piper L-4 or the Stinson L-5. Some L-3s were shipped to north Africa, and subsequently given to the Free French Forces in the area at the time. At least one of the aircraft served with US forces in Italy.And minimally one other did service in Normandy, as reported by the Detroit Free Press on 25 June 1944, with a photograph indicating transport of medical supplies to the advancing front- line regiments. The TG-5 was a three-seat training glider of 1942 based upon the O-58 design. This aircraft retained the O-58's rear fuselage, wings, and tail while adding a new front fuselage in place of the engine. In all, Aeronca built 250 TG-5 gliders for the Army.

It was produced from 1942 to 1943 by United Defense Supply Corp. for possible issue as a replacement for the Thompson submachine gun and was used by agents of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).. History A reporter of BBC in Kabul, 2005. The M42 submachine gun was designed by Carl G. Swebilius of the High Standard Manufacturing Company in 1940. When High Standard was tasked with producing .50 Browning machine guns for the British government, further development of the submachine gun was handled the United Defense Supply Corporation founded by Pope and Jackson of the British Purchasing Commission. United Defense did not have any manufacturing capability so it contracted with Marlin Firearms to have the M42 actually built. The UD M42 was promoted as a replacement for the Thompson submachine gun, which the U.S. military considered both expensive and complicated to produce. Made in both 9√ó19mm Parabellum and .45 ACP prototypes, the 9 mm version was the only one to ever see widespread production. About 15,000 were produced in the last three years of World War II. Only six .45 ACP prototype test guns were made. The weapon holds 25 9mm rounds in its magazine (designed by John E. Owsley, covered by patent 2,289,067). It has a cyclic rate of 700 rounds per minute. Frequently two 25-round magazines were welded face-to-face allowing a quick reload when the first became empty (see illustration). The weapon itself weighs (empty), with a length of . The barrel length is , and it has six-groove right-hand rifling. An extremely simple design, it was a straight blowback, selective fire weapon. It was built under \\"hurry-up\\" war conditions and some of its design flaws stem from this approach. Problems with the weapon were varied. Under combat conditions it was found that the sheet metal magazines had a tendency to warp out of shape causing feeding problems. They had little tolerance for exposure to large amounts of mud and sand and tended to jam if not cleaned regularly. The gun was also labor-intensive to produce. It used all machined parts, no stampings, and under wartime conditions machine work is at a premium. However, proving ground tests showed it was easier to strip and maintain than the Thompson or Sten Mark II and was more accurate at 100 yards. Despite its expense and precision, the UD M42 enjoyed a good reputation in OSS usage. The War Department was interested in purchasing large quantities of the M42, but due to complicated legal issues, manufacturing rights, and royalties only 15,000 units were purchased. The M42 submachine gun was classified as a substitute standard when the M3 submachine gun was introduced. It is often stated that it used 20-round magazines, which were used in .45-caliber prototypes, but only 25-round magazines were used in the 9mm production version. Operational use Intended for use by U.S. troops at the time of its design, it found more favor being air-dropped to partisan forces in occupied Europe. The weapon was air dropped to supply British-led partisan forces on the island of Crete, where it was used extensively. It also saw use among the partisan forces of the Italian and French Resistance. Some of them were transferred to Dai Li's regular resistance forces in China for use against the Japanese invasion. The United Defense M42 was issued for use by Filipino troops under the Philippine Army and Philippine Constabulary during World War II from 1942 through the Post-World War II era until the 1960s and was used by the local recognized guerrillas from 1942 to 1945 during the Japanese Occupation. The use of the 9 mm caliber allowed resistance forces to use captured ammunition in their weapons, eliminating the need for repeated re-supply drops. Overall the weapon failed in its intended role (to replace the Thompson) but proved effective in limited use in the hands of resistance forces.

It served all of Mississippi until the state was split into two dioceses, Jackson and Biloxi. The cathedral in Natchez, Mississippi is now a minor basilica and has retained much of its historical architectural splendor. History Spanish rule began in the area of Natchez in 1779 and in 1788, a Spanish wood frame church dedicated to the Holy Savior (San Salvador) was built in the center of the city. San Salvador burned down in 1832.\\"Diocesan History\\", Roman Catholic Diocese of Jackson The Roman Catholic diocese of Natchez, (in Latin Natchesium), was founded on July 28, 1837 and originally covered the entire state of Mississippi. Rev. Thomas Heyden of the Diocese of Pittsburgh was appointed the first bishop of the diocese in 1837, but he respectfully declined. Bishop Antoine Blanc of New Orleans served as administrator. The first bishop of the diocese, John Mary Chanche, S.S. (1795‚Äì1852), president of St. Mary's College in Baltimore, was appointed three years later, in 1840. He was consecrated bishop on 14 March, 1841. Chanche sailed to New Orleans and traveled by steamboat to Natchez, where he arrived near midnight on May 18, 1841. On his arrival, he met the only priest in the new diocese, Father Brogard, who was there only temporarily. In the role of a missionary, Bishop Chanche began to contact the Catholics and organize the new diocese. Three of his nieces opened the first Catholic school in Mississippi. The Cathedral of the Sorrowful Heart of Mary was designed by Baltimore architect Robert Cary Long Jr.,\\"Natchez\\", Historic Churches of Mississippi, Univ. Press of Mississippi, 2007, p. 102 an alumnus of St. Mary's. Two years earlier, Long had designed for Chanche a steeple for the college's chapel. The cornerstone was laid in 1842. Chanche died in 1852, presumably of cholera,\\"Body of first bishop of Mississippi exhumed in Baltimore\\", Archdiocese of Baltimore in Frederick, Maryland, while returning from the First Plenary Council of Baltimore.

On December 18, 1956, the diocese was renamed the Diocese of Natchez- Jackson and many operations of the diocese moved to Jackson. On March 1, 1977, the Mississippi diocese was split into two dioceses: the Diocese of Jackson and the Diocese of Biloxi. After this, the Diocese of Natchez became a titular see.

Following the war, Miletus and Lydia concluded an alliance. Thrasybulus was an ally of Periander, the tyrant of Corinth. He features in a famous anecdote from Herodotus's Histories,Herodotus The Histories, 5.92f in which a messenger from Periander asks Thrasybulus for advice on ruling.Aristotle tells the same story albeit with reversed roles (Thrasybulus asks Periander) in Politics, 3, 1284a and Politics, 5, 1311a Thrasybulus, instead of responding, takes the messenger for a walk in a field of wheat, where he proceeds to cut off all of the best and tallest ears of wheat.

The band consists of Shane Barnard (vocals, acoustic guitar) and Shane Everett (vocals). They are often joined by their drummer and manager, Joey Parish. Background =Shane Barnard= Barnard was born Shane Corey Barnard on January 14, 1976, in Placerville, California, to father James David Barnard and mother Margaret Ann Barnard (n√©e, Gardner), and later grew up in Lubbock, Texas, where he attended Texas Tech University and later Texas A&M; University. It was there that he led worship at the popular Christian student gathering Breakaway, and where he met Everett. Barnard is also known for his unique style of strumming the acoustic guitar and his high vocal range. During his junior year as a student at Texas A&M; University, Barnard began a recording career. Prior to joining Everett, Barnard teamed up with friend Caleb Carruth to release an album. Entitled Salvation Still Remains, it was released in limited numbers. Barnard and Carruth later agreed to end their partnership amicably, stating that they \\"were just moving in different directions.\\" Barnard is married to fellow CCM artist Bethany Dillon. =Shane Everett= Everett was born Shane Eric Everett on July 30, 1974, in Dallas, Texas, to father Larry Leon Everett and mother Leigh Ann Everett (n√©e, Milton), and later moved to Rowlett, a nearby suburb. Everett also attended Texas A&M; University. One night after playing with his band in a bar, Everett felt moved by God, which led him to quit his band and start attending church regularly. Shortly thereafter, he met Barnard, and became part of Breakaway Ministries, a weekly student-led praise and worship service at Texas A&M.; = Band = The band originally began with Barnard performing solo acts, but Everett increasingly played a major role in his performances.

It was the first permanent home of the Medical Department of Hampden-Sydney College (later renamed the Medical College of Virginia, MCV) and now is a part of Virginia Commonwealth University. It is considered by architectural scholars to be one of the finest surviving Egyptian Revival- style buildings in the nation. The Egyptian Building was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register on November 5, 1968, the National Register of Historic Places on April 16, 1969, and finally designated as a National Historic Landmark on November 11, 1971.  History  After several years in the Union Hotel, the board of the college decided they needed a space specifically created for medical education. Aid was sought to pay for the structure and the Commonwealth offered a $25,000 loan and Richmond donated $2,000. The board chose the noted Philadelphia architect, Thomas Somerville Stewart, who had just completed the new St Paul's Episcopal Church, to build the College Building. Stewart chose to design the new building in the Egyptian Revival mode, considered to be an exotic style. His choice of this style was considered to be appropriate by the board because it was considered that the origins of medicine went back to the Egyptian physician, Imhotep. Sir William Osler wrote that Imhotep was the \\"first figure of a physician to stand out clearly from the mists of antiquity.\\"Osler, W. (1921). The evolution of modern medicine: given at Yale University as the Silliman Memorial Lectures, in April, 1913. New Haven: Yale University Press. The Egyptian Building was originally called College Building, and later the Old College Building. The National Register of Historic Places considers it to be the oldest medical college building in the South. The battered corners of the walls of the structure recall the temples of ancient Egypt. The building housed most educational activities until the 1890s and included medical lecture halls, a dissecting room, an infirmary and hospital beds for medical and surgical cases. The building was restored in 1939 by the architects, Baskervill and Son, in honor of Dr. Simon Baruch, an 1862 graduate of the Medical College of Virginia. At that time the interior of the building was remodeled to carry on the Egyptian style. The building has been in continuous use since it was built in 1845. In 1969 it became a historic landmark, and in 1995 it celebrated its 150th anniversary. It has at one time or another, been used by every school in the Medical College. The MCV Campus has a strong sentimental attachment to the Egyptian Building. At Founders' Day exercises held at the Egyptian Building, 5 December 1940, historian Dr. Wyndham Blanton commented to alumni and guests: > \\"What old Nassau Hall is to Princeton, what the Wren Building is to William > and Mary, what the Rotunda is to the University of Virginia, the Egyptian > Building is to the Medical College of Virginia. It is a shrine, a sanctuary > of tradition, the physical embodiment of our genius. It is a spiritual > heritage. In a world often accused of cold materialism, with an ideology of > human self-sufficiency, and an adoration of objects that can be handled and > seen, there is a need for things of the spirit, if science is to do more > than make life safer, longer and more comfortable.\\" Architecture The building is constructed from brick, stucco and cast iron. Its battered walls‚Äîthinner at the top than at the bottom‚Äîgive an impression of solidity and height. This effect is emphasized by the relatively minimal windows for a five-story building. These windows are diamond paned and incorporated without a style break. A primary feature of the building is its distyle in antis porticoes with monumental columns at each end. The columns have intricate palm frond capitals. The shafts of each column represent bundles of reeds. Several obelisks flank the structure and are connected by a cast iron fence that incorporates what appears to be hermai, resembling sarcophagi (mummy cases), forged by R. W. Barnes of Richmond. Detail of east portico. Also prominent throughout the building is the use of the Winged sun disk. On the exterior it is found repeated in the cavetto cornices that cap the pylons. This winged disk represents Horus, as a sun disk with outstretched wings, flanked by the goddesses Bekbet and Uaset in the form of snakes. This is the form Horus took in Egyptian mythology when he battled the god Set. On the interior, the lotus flower design is used repeatedly. The interior colors have intentional symbolic meaning: red represents divine love; blue represents divine intelligence; and the golden yellow represents the mercy of God. Hieroglyphs are incorporated in the antechamber decorations and the floor tiles depict a large scarab beetle. The lintel, or horizontal part of the doorjamb, bears a different set of messages. On the left is reads, \\"Tutankhamen: To whom life is given forever\\" and on the right it reads,\\"Tutankhamen: Living image of Amon.\\" This message likely represents the fervor with which the public associated Egypt with the child Pharaoh, King Tut (Tutankhamen), who was discovered in 1922, very near to when this interior was remodeled.

SERT provides the QPS with the ability to respond to high risk situations incidents statewide. SERT is based in Brisbane and Cairns to ensure that specialists capabilities are available to support police at any location in Queensland. History In mid-1966, Jack Pizzey, then Minister for Education and Police, instructed the Commissioner of Police to form an Emergency Squad. Hand picked officers completed specialised training with the New South Wales Police Force similarly named unit and became operational in 1968. Initially, the Squad included 33 men, handpicked and trained in tactics to apprehend armed offenders in siege situations, hijacking of aircraft and counter-terrorism. In the mid 1980s, the Emergency Squad was a part-time unit of 50 officers, from various sections of the Brisbane Criminal Investigation Branch and from uniform, with officers performing normal policing duties and responding to incidents as required. In addition, a small six man Emergency Squad was located in Townsville to respond to incidents in North Queensland and to act in a holding capacity until the arrival of Brisbane officers. In 1987, the Emergency Squad was divided into sub-units and renamed the Tactical Response Group (TRG). In 1989 the Tactical Response team, a part of the TRG became a separate unit ‚Äì the Special Weapons and Operations Squad known as SWOS. SWOS was a part-time unit with officers performing normal policing duties, responding to incidents as required and training one day per a fortnight. In 1992, the Queensland Police Service established a full-time dedicated police tactical group the Special Emergency Response Team (SERT) from SWOS. The role of SERT also included undertaking of high angle rescue and land search co-ordination. SERT had a long tradition of training with Japanese police Special Assault Team officers providing an opportunity to share tactics, equipment and training methodologies. Notable recent incidents include disarming an armed man in the Queen Street Mall in Brisbane in March 2013. In December 2018, SERT assisted in the apprehension of two gunmen during a 6-hour-long siege in Auchenflower, wherein one officer was shot at, but not wounded. SERT contributed to the security forces assigned to protect the 2014 G20 Brisbane summit and 2018 Commonwealth Games. The primary unit of SERT is based in Brisbane part of the Specialist Response Branch in the Operations Support Command within Queensland Police Service. The sub-unit based in Cairns is part of the Far North District in the Northern Region under the operational command of the Specialist Response Branch. The Specialist Response Branch also includes the Negotiator Coordination Unit and Explosive Ordnance Response Team (EORT) who both work closely with SERT. SERT has its own police dogs. Role The role of SERT includes: * Counter terrorism operations * Resolving siege and hostage situations, as well as armed offender situations; * Undertaking searches of premises in high risk situations; * The arrest of armed and dangerous offenders; * Escorting and securing dangerous prisoners in high risk situations; * High angle rescue * Less lethal tactics deployment * Water and Airborne operations and insertion * Witness Protection Selection To qualify for a three-day selection course SERT hopefuls have to undergo a gruelling fitness regime. They must complete a minimum of 10 chin ups, 35 push ups and 100 sit ups all to cadence, then run 10 km in under 46 minutes and finally swim 400 metres in under 10 minutes. All this is done consecutively without a rest. This is the minimum fitness standard required, and is assessed with zero tolerance. The three-day selection course is regarded as the most difficult and physically demanding course within the Queensland Police Service. It tests physical and mental endurance through individual and team tasks, problem solving, sleep deprivation, basic survival skills and by challenging phobias for example heights and closed spaces. Several female officers have attempted selection. Candidates who are successful on the selection course are invited to attend a 14-week training course where all the skills of the unit are taught. The first four weeks consist of physical training, 2 hours in the morning and 2 hours in the evening, interspersed with weapons validations and training. The next two weeks consist of rural tactics and marksman training. The next six weeks consist of close quarter tactics, methods of entry, tactical driving, roping, fast roping and other skills. Upon graduation, successful applicants can apply for available positions where they are put into a team where further training and validations are required before becoming operational. Specialist courses are then attended including water operations, breaching, advanced roping, advanced close quarter tactics and opportunities to attend advanced training with other police and military units. Equipment In April 2011, SERT took delivery of a Lenco BearCat armoured vehicle designated the Armoured Response Vehicle (ARV), that had been provided by the Queensland Government and with the internal layout and configuration specially designed to SERT's specifications. In July 2012, SERT received a second Lenco BearCat provided by the Commonwealth Government that is based in Cairns. In March 2017, the QPS received a third Lenco vehicle a Bombcat, similar to the BearCat, for the Explosive Ordnance Response Team. In January 2017, SERT took delivery of an OzBot Titan robot, designed by Deakin University in Victoria for SERT, that can remotely, breach doors and windows, assist in the rescue of hostages, deliver and retrieve items in dangerous locations, and improve situational awareness with its digital camera. The sidearm carried is the Heckler & Koch USP which is exclusive to the unit as regular officers carry Glock pistols. M4 Carbine style of rifles are also used and are customised to suit the needs of the unit. Mobile Response Capability Between July 2015 and January 2016, the Public Safety Response Team (PSRT) part of the Specialist Services Group within the Operations Support Command, trialled a Mobile Response Capability (MRC), utilising structured teams of four PSRT officers based on the Victoria Police Critical Incident Response Team model. The success of the trial has resulted in the MRC becoming embedded in the PSRT capability, primarily servicing Brisbane Metropolitan, Logan, and Ipswich Districts. The MRC roles are to support first-response officers at high-risk situations to de-escalate the incident and also to conduct patrols around priority sites and critical infrastructure and places of mass gatherings to provide a timely response in the event of an incident. The MRC has the ability to assist with containment and cordon placements of high-risk situations until the arrival of SERT and assist with hostage reception. MRC officers have a range of specialised equipment including helmets and ballistics shields, and are issued with Remington R4 and SIG Sauer SIGM400 rifles, and have a range of less-than-lethal options, including the Penn Arms 40mm grenade launcher and pepper-ball gun.

Description Reaching approximately 25 cm, the ruddy kingfisher has a very large, bright red bill and equally red legs. The body is rust red, generally deepening to purple at the tail. There is little sexual dimorphism though some sources report male birds being somewhat brighter in plumage. Due to its preference for heavily forested areas, the kingfisher's high, descending call is more often heard than the bird itself is seen, and these birds generally travel singly or in pairs. Distribution and habitat H. coromanda by John Gerrard Keulemans The ruddy kingfisher ranges from South Korea and Japan in the north, south through the Philippines to the Sunda Islands, and west to China and India. It is migratory, with birds in the northern part of the range migrating as far south as Borneo during winter. Locally common in southern parts of its range, the ruddy kingfisher is rare in Japan, where it is highly sought after by birders. Ruddy kingfishers inhabit forested areas from the temperate to tropical zones, often in thick jungles and rainforests. The binomial name recalls the Coromandel Coast of India. Behaviour and ecology =Food and feeding= Like other kingfishers, ruddy kingfishers generally feed on fish, crustaceans, and large insects. However, in areas with less running water, they are known to eat frogs and other amphibians.

King. A self-taught musician, he was known for his effective and clean drum patterns. He was one of the originators of funk drumming, and is one of the most sampled drummers. Life and career Starks was born in Jackson, Alabama, to Prince Starks and Ruth Watkins. One of five children, he was nicknamed \\"Jabo\\" as a newborn. He grew up in Mobile, Alabama. In seventh grade he was captivated by drumbeats at a Mardi Gras parade in Mobile and decided to pursue drumming. He was self- taught and had no formal training. He said he \\"learned a lot from listening\\" to music. Early on, he listened to blues music and was influenced by the gospel music he heard in church. One of his drum idols was Shep Sheppard of the Bill Doggett band. He graduated from Mobile County Training School in 1955, at the time a high school. He then performed at the Harlem Duke Social Club where he backed notable blues and R&B; musicians including John Lee Hooker, Smiley Lewis, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, Big Mama Thornton and Howlin' Wolf. In 1959 Starks joined Bobby Bland's band and was the youngest member of the band. He said band members Pluma Davis and Joe Scott taught him the importance of holding the drum rhythm steady and having other musicians lock-in with drums. He said musically that was the best band he played with. He was with the band from 1959 to 1965 and recorded on the band's releases over this period, including \\"Turn on Your Love Light\\", \\"Stormy Monday Blues\\", \\"That's the Way Love Is\\", \\"I Pity the Fool\\" and \\"Don't Cry No More\\". He also recorded with other artists during this time such as Junior Parker and Joe Hinton, on songs \\"Driving Wheel\\" and \\"Funny\\". In 1965 Starks joined James Brown's band. From 1965 to 1970 the band had two drummers, Starks and Clyde Stubblefield. Starks came primarily from a blues background whereas Stubblefield came from a soul and jazz background. They each performed solo on songs that fit their style. The two \\"created the grooves on many of Brown's biggest hits, and laid the foundation for modern funk drumming in the process.\\" In 1970 the band went through a major transformation with Stubblefield leaving the group in late 1970. Starks continued performing with the reconfigured band which became known as The J.B.'s. Band members included bassist Bootsy Collins and rhythm guitarist Catfish Collins who along with Starks formed the rhythm section. The band also included trombonist Fred Wesley. Starks toured and recorded with Brown until 1976. Starks' recordings during his eleven year association with Brown include \\"The Payback\\", \\"Sex Machine\\", \\"Soul Power\\", \\"Super Bad\\", \\"Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing\\", \\"Doing It to Death\\", \\"Papa Don't Take No Mess\\", \\"Licking Stick ‚Äì Licking Stick\\". He also backed artists produced or managed by Brown, most notably Lyn Collins and Bobby Byrd, as well as the independent works released by The J.B.'s. Often uncredited, Starks and Stubblefield rank as two of the most sampled drummers on contemporary hip hop and R&B; recordings. Starks‚Äô drum patterns have been sampled by LL Cool J, Kendrick Lamar, The Roots, A Tribe Called Quest, Black Eyed Peas, Kool Moe Dee, Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock, Total and others. About the lack of recognition he said \\"the least they could do is say where they got [the samples] from.\\" Starks left Brown's band in mid-1970s and joined blues artist B.B. King. Starks was well versed in blues music in his early career. In regard to his transition from uptempo funk to laid-back blues, he said \\"to me, everything stems from playing the blues anyway.\\" He toured and recorded with King for six years. His recordings with King include the albums Lucille Talks Back and King Size. Starks and Stubblefield remained friends. In 1999 they performed on The J.B.'s album Bring the Funk on Down. The duo went on to release original music as the Funkmasters. They released the album Find the Groove in 2001 and the album Come Get Summa This in 2006. They released an instructional video titled Soul of the Funky Drummers. In 2007 the duo joined Bootsy Collins for the first tribute concert in memory of James Brown and performed on the soundtrack for the movie Superbad. In his later years Starks lived in Mobile, Alabama. From the mid-1990s onward, when not touring or recording, he performed five nights a week at the Picolo Restaurant and Red Bar in Grayton Beach, Florida, and on Sundays he played drums at his church in Mobile. He performed until March 2018. He said over the years he learned little tricks to help him maintain his drumming skills. He died on May 1, 2018, at his home in Mobile, Alabama, at the age of 79 from leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. He was survived by his wife Naomi Taplin Starks, a daughter, a son, and two grandchildren. Recognition In 2013 Starks and Stubblefield received the Yamaha Legacy Award. In 2016 Rolling Stone magazine named Starks and Stubblefield the sixth best drummer of all time. According to National Public Radio, \\"the grooves the two drummers (Starks and Stubblefield) created have inspired generations of artists ‚Äì not just in funk, but in hip- hop, where their steady but intricate patterns make natural material for sampling.\\" Bassist Bootsy Collins called Starks the steady rock that he built his bass grooves on while with James Brown. Trombonist Fred Wesley called Starks his favorite drummer and said \\"I could just lose myself in that 'stop your heart' groove and just blow free.‚Äù According to The Pacemakers drummer Frank \\"Kash\\" Waddy, Starks was a disciplined player and his \\"forte was to play very clean, very straight ahead.\\" According to drummer-journalist Ahmir Thompson, Starks was Brown‚Äôs \\"most effective drummer\\" and called his eight-on- the-floor style \\"unique\\". He credits Starks' drum patterns for the birth of New Jack Swing and Baltimore club/Jersey club styles. Drummer-author Jim Payne wrote: Starks \\"could put the groove somewhere between 16th notes and 16th-note triplets and turn funk into an infectious, swinging half-time shuffle. His drum tracks, sampled again and again by hip-hoppers and hit-makers, attest to the strength and longevity of his creative talents.\\" Quotations In a 1995 interview with WGBH, Starks said: \\"I'm not trying to outplay anybody else. The only thing I want to do is keep that heartbeat going as they call it, (...) the bass player or the guitar player or the horn player could do whatever he wants to do because he knows that that solid foundation is back there behind him.\\" In a 2015 interview with Mobile Bay Magazine, Starks said, \\"When I'm playing music (...) there ain't nobody in the world higher than I am.\\" Selected discography Credits adapted in part from AllMusic and Discogs.

In October 2015, Zimbabwe Football Association president Cuthbert Dube stepped down after five years in charge during which the organisation‚Äôs debt rose to $6 million and national teams repeatedly struggled to fulfil away assignments due to a lack of funds.

Rushwaya was found guilty of sending the national team to play unauthorised matches in Asia in 2009. Her sacking followed her suspension in July 2010 on suspicion of fixing matches in a Malaysian tournament. She was also found guilty of requesting a loan of $103,000 from Zimbabwe's sports commission, an amount that is now unaccounted for. The national teams matches against Thailand, Syria and a Malaysian club were accepted without the permission of Zifa's board or Zimbabwe's sports commission, which must authorise foreign trips by Zimbabwe teams. Rushwaya also allowed the former Zimbabwe champions Monomotapa to go to Malaysia in 2009 masquerading as the national team of Zimbabwe.

The controversies primarily concern the Japanese nationalist efforts to whitewash the actions of the Empire of Japan during World War II. Another serious issue is the constitutionality of the governmentally-approved textbook depictions of World War II, Japanese war crimes, and Japanese imperialism during the first half of the 20th century. The history textbook controversies have been an issue of deep concern both domestically and internationally, particularly in countries which were victims of Imperial Japan during the war. Despite the efforts of the nationalist textbook reformers, by the late 1990s the most common Japanese schoolbooks contained references to, for instance, the Nanjing Massacre, Unit 731, and the comfort women of World War II, all historical issues which have faced challenges from ultranationalists in the past. The most recent of the controversial textbooks, the New History Textbook, published in 2000, which significantly downplays Japanese aggression, was shunned by nearly all of Japan's school districts. Textbook authorization system School textbooks in Japan are not written by the Ministry of Education. Instead, the textbooks for all subjects in elementary, and both lower and upper secondary schools are written and published by several major private companies. This system was introduced to Japan after World War II to avoid government having direct authority over the written contents. Japan's School Education Law () requires schools to use textbooks that are authorized by the Ministry of Education (MEXT). However, each local education board has the final authority to select which textbooks can be used in their jurisdiction from the approved list. In Japan, potential school textbooks must pass a sequence of evaluations before receiving approval to be used in Japanese schools. First, textbook companies submit a draft of their proposed textbooks to the Japanese Ministry of Education. The Textbook Authorization and Research Council (), an official council of the Ministry of Education, composed of university professors, junior high teachers, checks the draft in accordance with the Ministry's educational curriculum guidelines () to ensure that the contents of the proposed textbook is \\"objective, impartial, and free from errors.\\" The Ministry of Education will give the company that authored the textbook the opportunity to revise the draft when it is found to contain information that is inconsistent with national guidelines. Once the textbook revisions are complete and the textbook has received the approval of the Ministry of Education, Local Boards of Education select books from a list of authorized textbooks for schools under their jurisdiction. The process of textbook authorization is ongoing and conducted every four years, the results of which are presented to the public the following year. Critics claim that the government textbook authorization system has been used to reject textbooks that depict Imperial Japan in a negative light. This includes a case in the 1960s where a description of the Nanjing Massacre and other war crimes committed by the Japanese military before and during World War II was rejected by the Ministry of Education. The author sued the Ministry, finally winning the case decades later. Recent controversy focuses on the approval of a history textbook published by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, which placed emphasis on the achievements of pre‚ÄìWorld War II Imperial Japan, as well as a reference to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with fewer critical comments compared to the other Japanese history textbooks. Historian Stephen E. Ambrose noted that \\"The Japanese presentation of the war to its children runs something like this: 'One day, for no reason we ever understood, the Americans started dropping atomic bombs on us.'\\"Stephen Ambrose, To America: Personal Reflections of an Historian, 112. Defenders of the system counter that a book which fails to mention specific negative facts regarding the aggression and atrocities committed by Japan during World War II would also fail the Ministry of Education's approval process. During the approval process for the aforementioned history textbook by the Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, the author was ordered to revise the book's content several times before receiving final approval. Moreover, during the Cold War, the Ministry rejected textbooks by left-leaning publishers which attempted to portray the Soviet Union, Mainland China, North Korea and other Communist countries in a positive light. Defenders also point out that during the 1960s and 1970s, the extent of the atrocities, as well as the existence of many of the incidents, were still being debated by Japanese historians; therefore, the Ministry of Education was correct in rejecting references to specific atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre during that era, but the Ministry finally insisted on the inclusion of those same incidents after Japanese historians had finally reached consensus during the 1990s. They also point out that, North and South Korea, as well as China, which happen to be the most outspoken critics of the Japanese textbook approval process, do not allow private publishing companies to write history textbooks for their schools. Instead, the governments of those countries write a single history textbook for all of their schools. In the case of South Korea, the government strictly examines textbooks from different companies before being publicized. Critics of Chinese and Korean textbooks also argue that the textbooks of those countries are far more politically censored and self-favoring than Japanese textbooks. Today there are 30 unique textbooks for , from 5 different publishers, in Japanese primary schools. Additionally, there are 8 unique textbooks for , from 8 different publishers, for junior high schools. In Japanese high schools, the number of available options is much greater, with 50 unique textbook editions available for teaching Japanese, and world history. Textbook screening The current textbook authorization system began in 1947 under the direction of the U.S.-led Supreme Commander, Allied Powers (SCAP) authority during Japan's post‚ÄìWorld War II occupation. SCAP ordered the provisional government of Japan to end the system of and allow scholars in the private sector to write textbooks. Local educators would then choose which textbooks to use at their schools. Descriptions that promoted militarism and ultranationalism were eliminated, and the new idea to promote the dignity of the individual () was introduced. The New School Education Law states that while the government sets a curriculum guideline, it is not meant to establish a fixed, uniform line for all educators to observe, like in the old militarist days, but rather to help educators to creatively adapt the curriculum to the new demands of children and society in general. Major controversies Tokushi Kasahara identifies three time periods in postwar Japan during which he asserts the Japanese government has \\"waged critical challenges to history textbooks in attempts to tone down or delete descriptions of Japan's wartime aggression, especially atrocities such as the Nanjing Massacre.\\" The first challenge occurred in 1955, and the second took place in the early 1980s. The third began in 1997 and continues unresolved to this day. =\\"Ureubeki Ky≈çkasho\\" issue (1955)= At the general election of February 1955, the Japan Democratic Party proposed an idea that whilst editing of school textbooks might be left to the private sector, the government ought to supervise them and limit the kinds of textbooks to about two for each subject by tightening the authorization, so that the textbooks in effect would be equivalent to government-designated textbooks. At the Special Committee on Administrative Inspection of the House of Representatives in July of the same year, Kazutomo Ishii () of the Democratic Party of Japan suggested that textbooks were about to be published that could overthrow the principle of the education of Japan. He characterized these textbooks as: *Intentionally and unwarrantably depicting the life of the working class of Japan as extremely horrible, so that it seems to be a product of the defects of the social system and of the self-contradiction of capitalism. *Extolling the Soviet Union and the Republic of China (the People's Republic of China was not officially recognized at the time) very emphatically and seeming to suggest that Japan should be subservient to them. In addition, from August to October of the same year, the Japan Democratic Party published three volumes of booklets entitled \\"Ureubeki Ky≈çkasho\\" (, deplorable textbooks). The first volume listed four types of bias as \\"examples of biased education that appeared in textbooks\\": * Ones that unconditionally support the labor union of teachers and the Japan Teachers Union, and advance their political activities: Miyahara Seiichi () ed., social studies textbook for high school, Ippan Shakai (), published from Jikkyo Shuppan (). * Ones that hype how horrible the predicament of the Japanese workers are, and thereby advances a radical and destructive labor movement: Munakata Seiya () ed., social studies textbook for junior high school, Shakai no Shikumi (), published from Ky≈çiku Shuppan (). * Ones that particularly glorify and extol the Soviet Union and the Republic of China, and castigate Japan: Sugo Hiroshi () ed., social studies textbook for 6th grade, Akarui Shakai (), published from Chuuky≈ç Shuppan (). * Ones that instill children with Marxist‚ÄìLeninist, i.e. communist ideas: Osada Arata () ed., social studies textbook for junior high school, Mohan Chuugaku Shakai (), published from Jikky≈ç Shuppan (). The Japan Democratic Party condemned these textbooks as biased \\"red textbooks\\" (). In response to this, the authors and editors of the listed textbooks made various public statements and protest notes. However, the Japan Democratic Party did not reply. Since this incident a greater number of textbooks had been rejected as being biased (). The changes resulted in one-third of pre-existing textbooks being banned from Japanese schools. The Ministry of Education required that new textbooks avoid criticism of Japanese involvement in the Pacific War, and avoid mention of the Japanese invasion of China and involvement in the Second Sino-Japanese War at all.Joseph Chapel, \\"Denial of the Holocaust and the Rape of Nanking\\" (2004) =\\"Section F\\" purge= Textbook screening in 1956, right after a change of the members of Textbook Authorization Research Council () in September of the previous year, failed six drafts of textbooks, a significantly greater number than before. The evaluations of drafts by the Council had been noted by five letters from A to E, each representing the evaluation of a member in the Council. At 1955's screening, however, there was an additional section F that was considered responsible for the rejection of all the six drafts. Over this incident professor Iwao Takayama () of Nihon University who newly joined the Council was suspected to be the writer of section F, and the news media reported the incident as the \\"Section F purge\\" (, \\"F-ko paaji\\"). =Ienaga v. Japan (1965‚Äì1997)= Saburo Ienaga was a Japanese historian known partly for his involvement in controversies regarding school history textbooks. In 1953, the Japanese Ministry of Education published a textbook by Ienaga but censored what they said were factual errors and matters of opinion, regarding Japanese war crimes. Ienaga undertook a series of lawsuits against the Ministry for violation of his freedom of speech. He was nominated for the 2001 Nobel Peace Prize by Noam Chomsky among others.\\"Obituary: Saburo Ienaga: One man's campaign against Japanese censorship\\" Jonathan Watts. The Guardian. London (UK): Dec 3, 2002. p. 22\\"Persistence of memory: Saburo Ienaga insists Japan remember an unsavoury war to ensure dreams of peace\\" John Price. The Vancouver Sun. Vancouver, B.C.: Mar 7, 2001. p. A.13 =Neighboring Country Clause= On June 26, 1982, the Japanese textbook authorization system became a major diplomatic issue for the first time when Asahi Shimbun reported that the Ministry of Education demanded a textbook, which stated that the Japanese army invaded () Northern China, be rewritten using the phrase \\"advanced () into\\" instead of invaded. Having heard this news the Chinese government strongly protested to the Japanese government. In response, on August 26, 1982, Kiichi Miyazawa, then the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, made the following statement: #The Japanese Government and the Japanese people are deeply aware of the fact that acts by our country in the past caused tremendous suffering and damage to the peoples of Asian countries, including the Republic of Korea (ROK) and China, and have followed the path of a pacifist state with remorse and determination that such acts must never be repeated. Japan has recognized, in the Japan-ROK Joint Communiqu√© of 1965, that the \\"past relations are regrettable, and Japan feels deep remorse,\\" and in the Japan-China Joint Communiqu√©, that Japan is \\"keenly conscious of the responsibility for the serious damage that Japan caused in the past to the Chinese people through war and deeply reproaches itself.\\" These statements confirm Japan's remorse and determination which I stated above and this recognition has not changed at all to this day. #This spirit in the Japan-ROK Joint Communiqu√© and the Japan- China Joint Communiqu√© naturally should also be respected in Japan's school education and textbook authorization. Recently, however, the Republic of Korea, China, and others have been criticizing some descriptions in Japanese textbooks. From the perspective of building friendship and goodwill with neighboring countries, Japan will pay due attention to these criticisms and make corrections at the Government's responsibility. #To this end, in relation to future authorization of textbooks, the Government will revise the Guideline for Textbook Authorization after discussions in the Textbook Authorization and Research Council and give due consideration to the effect mentioned above. Regarding textbooks that have already been authorized, Government will take steps quickly to the same effect. As measures until then, the Minister of Education, Sports, Science and Culture will express his views and make sure that the idea mentioned in 2. Above is duly reflected in the places of education. #Japan intends to continue to make efforts to promote mutual understanding and develop friendly and cooperative relations with neighboring countries and to contribute to the peace and stability of Asia and, in turn, of the world.Statement by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kiichi Miyazawa on History Textbooks Despite the widespread attention that the issue received in both the Japanese and international media, investigations done in September 1982 reveal that the alleged change never actually took place, that the ministry of education did not even make a recommendation for the change, and that the entire incident was caused by hasty and inaccurate reporting by a small group of journalists assigned to cover the Ministry of Education.Pyle, Kenneth B. 1983. \\"Japan Besieged: The Textbook Controversy,\\" Journal of Japanese Studies, 9(2): 297-301. In November 1982 the Ministry of Education adopted a new authorization criterion, the so-called \\"Neighboring Country Clause\\" (): Textbooks ought to show understanding and seek international harmony in their treatment of modern and contemporary historical events involving neighboring Asian countries (). =New History Textbook= In 2000, Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform, a group of conservative scholars, published the New History Textbook (Atarashii Rekishi Kyokasho, ), which was intended to promote a revised view of Japan. The textbook downplays or whitewashes the nature of Japan's military aggression in the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910, the Second Sino-Japanese War, and in World War II. The textbook was approved by the Ministry of Education in 2001, and caused a huge controversy in Japan, China and Korea. A large number of Japanese historians and educators protested against the content of New History Textbook and its treatment of Japanese wartime activities. China Radio International reported that the PRC government and people were \\"strongly indignant about and dissatisfied with the new Japanese history textbook for the year 2002 compiled by right-wing Japanese scholars\\".CRI Online, April 2001 Subsequently, the New History Textbook was used by only 0.039% of junior high schools in Japan as of August 15, 2001. According to the Society, there are currently eight private junior high schools, one public school for the disabled in Tokyo, three public junior high schools and four public schools for the disabled in Ehime that use their textbook (Mainichi Shimbun, September 27, 2004).Sven Saaler: Politics, Memory and Public Opinion: The History Textbook Controversy and Japanese Society. Munich: 2005 Anti-Japanese demonstrations were held in the spring of 2005 in China and South Korea to protest against the New History Textbook. Protests in Beijing were supervised by the Chinese Communist Party, and Japanese flags were burned in front of the Japanese embassy.Crampton, Thomas, and International Herald Tribune. ‚ÄúThe Ongoing Battle over Japan's Textbooks.‚Äù The New York Times, The New York Times, 12 Feb. 2002, www.nytimes.com/2002/02/12/news/the-ongoing-battle-over-japans-textbooks.html. =Comfort women comments= In 2007, former education minister Nariaki Nakayama declared he was proud that the Liberal Democratic Party had succeeded in getting references to \\"wartime sex slaves\\" struck from most authorized history texts for junior high schools. \\"Our campaign worked, and people outside government also started raising their voices.\\" =2007 passage change on forced World War II suicides= Japan ordered history books to change passages on forced suicides during World War II. In June 2007, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly officially asked the Ministry of Education of Japan to retract its instruction to downplay the military's role in mass suicide in Okinawa in 1945. More than 100,000 people in Okinawa rallied against the textbook changes at the end of September. According to the Kyodo News agency, it was the biggest staged rally on the island since its 1972 return to Japanese rule. Okinawa governor Hirokazu Nakaima spoke to the crowds, commenting that the Japanese military's involvement in the mass suicides should not be forgotten. Studies A comparative study begun in 2006 by the Asia‚ÄìPacific Research Center at Stanford University on Japanese, Chinese,Korean and US textbooks describes 99% of Japanese textbooks as having a \\"muted, neutral, and almost bland\\" tone and \\"by no means avoid some of the most controversial wartime moments\\" like the Nanjing massacre or to a lesser degree the issue of comfort women. The project, led by Stanford scholars Gi- Wook Shin and Daniel Sneider, found that less than one percent of Japanese textbooks used provocative and inflammatory language and imagery, but that these few books, printed by just one publisher, received greater media attention. Moreover, the minority viewpoint of nationalism and revisionism gets more media coverage than the prevailing majority narrative of pacifism in Japan. Chinese and South Korean textbooks were found to be often nationalistic, with Chinese textbooks often blatantly nationalistic and South Korean textbooks focusing on oppressive Japanese colonial rule. US history textbooks were found to be nationalistic and overly patriotic, although they invite debate about major issues.

The kiosk was proposed and operated by Francis Parer. , ...Mr Francis Parer, of the St. Kilda Pier Pavilion... Until the 1930s, the structure was widely known as Parer's Pavilion; however, its actual name was the Austral Refreshment Rooms. In the 1930s it was renamed Kerby's Kiosk. Noble and Ivy Kerby acquired the lease from the Victorian Government in 1939. The Kerby family were involved with running the kiosk from 1934 until 1987. From 1987 until 2003 the kiosk was leased and operated by Joe Sillitoe, then Carmel Grant. On 11 September 2003 the structure was destroyed in an arson attack. After massive public support to rebuild the kiosk and the support of Premier Steve Bracks, it was reconstructed to the original 1903 plans, utilising some of the salvaged components, such as the cast iron roof, decorative cresting and weather vane. An additional structure, expanding the capacity was erected directly behind the kiosk and is obscured by the pavilion when viewed from the pier. The kiosk reopened in March 2006.

He was educated at the College of the City of New York and at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and earned his medical degree in 1881. He took a postgraduate course at the universities of Leipzig, Prague, and Vienna, and upon his return to America, established himself as a physician in New York in 1883. There, he became connected with Bellevue Hospital, the Good Samaritan Dispensary, and other medical institutions. In 1899, he was appointed as an assistant professor of pediatrics at Bellevue Medical College. In 1896, Koplik was the first to describe an important and early diagnostic sign of measles, now known as \\"Koplik's spots\\". The spots, which are considered pathognomonic for measles, occur in the mouth a few days before the skin rash appears, and before infectivity reaches its maximum. This allows individuals incubating the disease to be isolated and helps to control epidemics. He should also be remembered as the founder in America of free distribution of safe (i.e. sterilized, not pasteurized) baby milk, in which he was followed later by Nathan Straus.

The decision of Justice Richard Blackburn ruled against the Yolngu claimants on a number of issues of law and fact, rejecting the doctrine of Aboriginal title. Instead his ruling recognised that in the law of the time of British colonisation of Australia there was a distinction between settled colonies, where the land, being \\"desert and uncultivated\\", was claimed by right of occupancy, and conquered or ceded colonies. The decision also noted that the Crown had the power to extinguish native title, if it existed. The issue of terra nullius was not contemplated in the case. Although Milirrpum was not appealed beyond the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, it was overruled by the High Court of Australia two decades later in Mabo v Queensland (No 2), when the notion of terra nullius was found to be false. Background The Yolngu people, the traditional owners of Arnhem Land (which includes the Gove Peninsula), had petitioned the Australian House of Representatives in August 1963 with a bark petition after the government had sold part of the Arnhem Land reserve on 13 March of that year to a bauxite mining company, Nabalco without consultation with the traditional owners at the time. However, in 1968 the Commonwealth government granted a special mineral lease to the company over the land for a period of 42 years. In December 1968, the Yolngu people living in Yirrkala, represented by three plaintiffs, obtained writs in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory against the Nabalco Corporation, which had secured a 12-year bauxite mining lease from the Federal Government. The plaintiffs were Milirrpum, elder of the Rirratjingu clan; Munffaraway, elder of the Gumatj clan, and Daymbalipu, an elder of the Djapu clan, who represented that clan as well as acting on behalf of 11 other peoples with interests in the land. The plaintiffs' lawyers were Edward Woodward, Frank Purcell, John Little and John Fogarty. The plaintiffs claimed they enjoyed sovereignty over their land, and sought the freedom to occupy their lands. The applicants asserted before the Court that since time immemorial, they held a ‚Äúcommunal native title‚Äù that had not been validly extinguished, or acquired under the Lands Acquisition Act 1955 (Cth), and should be recognised as an enforceable proprietary right. The lengthy legal battle culminated in 1971.Foley, Gary 'Teaching the whites a lesson' in Staining the wattle (ed) Very Burgmann and Jenny Lee Ringwood; Penguin, 1988 p203 Ruling Justice Blackburn found that the Yolngu people could not prevent mining on their lands. He held that native title was not part of the law of Australia, and even had it existed, any native title rights had been extinguished. Further, even if extinguishment had not occurred, the plaintiffs were nor able to prove native title. Blackburn rejected the claim on the bases that: *A doctrine of common law native title had no place in a settled colony except under express statutory provisions (i.e. the recognition doctrine). *Under the recognition doctrine, pre-existing interests were not recognised unless they were rights of private property and, while the community possessed a legal system, it was not proved that under that legal system, the claimant clans possessed such rights. *The clan‚Äôs relationship to land was therefore not a ‚Äúright ... in connection with the land‚Äù under the Lands Acquisition Act 1955. *On the balance of probabilities, the applicants had not shown that, in 1788, their ancestors had the same links to the same areas of land that they were now claiming. The terms \\"settled\\" and \\"desert and uncultivated\\" included territory in which resided \\"uncivilized inhabitants in a primitive state of society\\". In such a territory, the laws of England (unless inconsistent with local laws) were imported when sovereignty was acquired. The doctrine of continuity did not relate to settled colonies, and therefore, \\"if there were no local laws then there were no rights of property to respect\\". A distinction between settled and conquered colonies was drawn. The decision also noted that the Crown had the power to extinguish native title, if it existed.Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd (1971) 17 FLR 141 (27 April 1971) Supreme Court (NT). Blackburn examined comparative Commonwealth, Canadian, New Zealand and US jurisprudence. He accepted that the applicants had established that under traditional law any given part of the land could be ‚Äúattributed‚Äù to a particular clan, but held that this did not amount to a proprietary interest. He also found that the evidence did not establish the landholding model asserted. Blackburn acknowledged for the first time in an Australian higher court the existence of a system of Aboriginal law. He also recognised the validity of the use of oral evidence to establish property rights, normally inadmissible, but a vital precondition for a successful land rights case, and he also acknowledged the claimants' ritual and economic use of the land. Blackburn acknowledged the claimants' ritual and economic use of the land and that they had an established system of law \\"a subtle and highly elaborate\\" system of laws (Madayin). The judgement concludes: \\"I cannot help being specially conscious that for the plaintiffs it is a matter in which their personal feelings are involved\\". In a confidential memorandum to the Government and Opposition, he opined that a system of Aboriginal land rights was \\"morally right and socially expedient\\".National Archives of Australia, confidential memorandum provided to government and opposition by Justice Blackburn urging the establishment of a statutory system of land rights, 1972, released 31 December 2001 Consequences There was a deliberate decision to pursue a political course rather than legal challenge to the High Court of Australia, which at the time because of the membership of the Court was likely to reject Blackburn‚Äôs finding that there was a coherent system of Aboriginal law relating to land. By not having the appeal rejected by the High Court, the findings of Justice Blackburn that were favourable to the plaintiffs (and by extension to other Aboriginal Australian peoples), and thus the concept of land rights, was maintained as a possibility, at least until the membership of the High Court had changed. Milirrpum led to the establishment of the Woodward Royal Commission by the Whitlam Government in 1973‚Äì4, and the eventual recognition of Aboriginal Land rights in the Northern Territory. In 1975, shortly before he was dismissed, Prime Minister Gough Whitlam drew up the Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976 which was later passed (in a slightly diluted form) by the conservative Fraser Government on 9 December 1976. The court interpreter for the case was Galarrwuy Yunupingu, the son of a Gumatj clan leader, Munggurrawuy, who was one of the Yirrkala plaintiffs. Galarrwuy had earlier helped his father draft the Yirrkala bark petitions. He later became chairman of the Northern Land Council and in 1978 became Australian of the Year for his work on Indigenous rights. The issue of terra nullius, which was not contemplated in this decision, was later raised and recognised in Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992),. which overturned the Blackburn ruling.

It is located in the Belgrade municipality of Stari Grad (Old Town). Skadarlija partially preserved the ambience of the traditional urban architecture, including its archaic urban organization, and is known as the main bohemian quarter of Belgrade, similar to Paris' Montmartre. After Kalemegdan, Skadarlija is the second most visited tourist attraction in Belgrade, contributing to one third of the city's foreign currency income.  Location  Skadarlija is located less than north- west of Terazije, central Belgrade. It begins right below the Republic Square and stretches along the short, winding Skadarska Street and the surroundings streets of Zetska and Cetinjska. One of the most famous streets in Belgrade, Skadarska is less than long. It connects the Despot Stefan Boulevard with the Du≈°anova Street, near the Bajloni open greenmarket and the Mira Trailoviƒá Square, where it extends into the neighborhood of Dorƒáol. Neighborhoods of Kopitareva Gradina and Jevremovac are to the east. Though today the term is mostly applied to the street only, Skadarlija is a former municipality of Belgrade and a wider quarter which includes some 20 neighboring streets.  Administration  Skadarlija became a separate municipality of Belgrade in 1952, after the previous post-World War II division of Belgrade into raions from 1945 to 1952 ended. That municipality included a large portion of urban Belgrade, mainly the Danube oriented neighborhoods like Dorƒáol, Jalija, Stari Grad, etc. By the 1953 census, municipality of Skadarlija had a population of 31,281. On 1 January 1957 it merged into the new municipality of Stari Grad and Skadarlija became a \\"local community\\" (mesna zajednica), sub-municipal administrative unit, within the municipality. According to the censuses, the local community of Skadarlija had a population of 7,399 in 1981, 7,074 in 1991 and 5,942 in 2002. Municipality of Stari Grad later abolished local communities.  History  = Origin = The history of Skadarlija began in 1830 with the settlement of Gypsies in the abandoned trenches in front of the ramparts. The Serbs and the Turks began settling in 1835, building the first proper houses with gardens, so the street stretched between two gates of the Belgrade Fortress: Stambol Gate and Vidin Gate. The 1854 town plan of Belgrade reveals that the Gypsy hovels had been replaced by brick buildings into which artisans, caterers, petty clerks and others moved. The whole locality was referred to as the Gypsy Quarter, Gypsy Alley or ≈†iƒáan Mala and remained a Romani settlement until 1870. In that period, the stream called Bibijin potok (\\"Bibija stream\\"), which originates under the modern Politika building in the Makedonska street, flowed down the alley, crossing it. The stream was named after Bibija, the Romani deity of salvation. At the time, Belgrade was divided into quarters, and the stream was an administrative border between the quarters of Palilula and Dorƒáol (Stari Grad). As Palilula limited the playing of music to midnight, people would then jump across the stream in the Dorƒáol section to continue with festivities. An aqueduct was later constructed which conducted the stream underground, which still flows below the street. The aqueduct was essentially a wall through the center of the street, and it also conducted water to the local households from the central pump in Terazije. Still, during the heavy rains or melting of the snow, the stream would still form and flow down the middle of the street. The largest arch of the aqueduct was named Skadar, after the town, so in 1872 the street was named Skadarska ulica. Serbian for \\"Skadar street\\", it is still the street's official name. As of 2018, Skadarska is among only 29 streets in Belgrade which never changed their names since the first naming of the city streets in 1872. = Bohemian quarter = Soon after the aqueduct was built, the first khans were built along the foothill of the wall. They were the precursors of later kafanas. Skadarlija began to acquire its bohemian character in the last few decades of the 19th century, and particularly after 1901, when the well-known Dardaneli inn, located where the National Museum in Belgrade is today, was demolished and its guests, prominent writers and actors, moved to the Skadarlija inns or kafanas. In the early 20th century there were 15 kafanas in Skadarlija, including: Tri ≈°e≈°ira (\\"Three Hats\\"), Dva jelena (\\"Two Deer\\"), Zlatni bokal (\\"The Golden Chalice\\"), Bandist, East, Guild, Vuk Karad≈æiƒá, Bums keler, Milo≈° Obiliƒá and The two Sergeants, Mala Pijaca (\\"Little Greenmarket\\"). The first three of these still survive today, accompanied by some new restaurants like Ima dana (\\"There will be days\\"), Skadarlija (demolished in 2006), Dva bela goluba (\\"Two White Doves\\"). In the late 19the century, the beginning of the street was a location of \\"Pa≈°onin bulevar\\", the very first Belgrade's music hall. As of 2019, the Tri ≈°e≈°ira, founded in 1864, is the oldest, still operational kafana in Skadarlija and second overall in Belgrade, after the ?. The end section of Skadarlija is known as the Skadarlija atrium. It is mostly occupied by the brewery that belonged to one of the most distinguished Belgrade families before World War II, the Czech-originating Bajloni family. It produced \\"Aleksandar\\" beer, made from thermal waters that spring out in the brewery's backyard. When Bajloni began digging for the foundations of his brewery in 1892, he discovered the bones of the mammoths and skulls of the Neanderthal Krapina man. The well is located 80 to 300 meters (250 to 1000 feet) under the surface. After 1945, the brewery became part of the \\"BIP\\" brewery, but was later closed. The spring water was bottled for drinking until the early 2000s. Under the brewery is a complex of lagums (subterranean galleries or catacombes), which were used as a storage rooms for the beer barrels. By 2008, the entire inner complex is abandoned and slated for demolition. However, as the project of massive reconstruction failed, the brewery became home for many coffeehouses and clubs. The houses in the street were small, with mud plastered walls and roofs covered with flat tiles (ƒáeramida). The houses had small yards with gardens and water taps and wooden, plank fences (taraba). Only occasional houses had a porch. By the 1930s, many survived while smaller number of houses was demolished and the new buildings were built instead. The street itself was paved with the rough, lumpy cobblestones. = 20th-century revitalization = The house of ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá, a well-known writer and painter who lived and died in Skadarlija, has been turned into a meeting place for the poets participating in the Skadarlija Evenings event. Its renovation and restoration began in 1968 in accordance with the designs made by a group of prominent artists: architect Uglje≈°a Bogunoviƒá (1922‚Äì94), writer and painter Zuko D≈æumhur (1921‚Äì89), painter Mario Maskareli (1918‚Äì96), sculptor Milica Ribnikar-Bogunoviƒá (1931), painter and writer Momo Kapor, among others. They managed to preserve its existing values and introduce modern facilities without interfering with its historical features. In the late 1960s, Skadarlija regained fame as the center of youth and bohemian artists of Belgade. Plans for further adaptations were made in 1977, but remained on paper until 2008. One of the first modern clubs in the neighborhood was \\"Monokl\\", opened across the \\"Tri ≈°e≈°ira\\" in the 1970s. Famous folk singer Silvana Armenuliƒá performed at the opening. DJ was Maksa ƒÜatoviƒá, who was previously a disc jokey in \\"Cepelin\\" in Ta≈°majdan. In 1985 theatre director Zorica Jevremoviƒá Munitiƒá founded Children's Street Theater /Uliƒçno deƒçje pozori≈°te/ in Skadarlija. The core of the troupe was made up of Romany children who lived in Skadarlija, 'white' children' from Dorcol (a nearby prestigious Belgrade neighborhood), Romany children from the favelas of the Belgrade suburb of Mirijevo (who sell flowers in Skadarlija), professional actors and painters who live in Skadarlija, a Skadarlija fortune-teller, clowns, fire eaters, and alternative artists (musicians, painters). = 21st century = In February 2008, plans were announced for the complete reconstruction of the lowest section of Skadarlija (Skadarlija atrium, an area of about ) bounded by the streets of Skadarska, Zetska, Cetinjska and Du≈°anova. Works are scheduled to begin in September 2008 and due to be finished by December 2010. A new multi-functional center will include two hotels, subterranean garage, restaurants, museum and a new pedestrian zone comprising a wide promenade between the Skadarska and Cetinjska streets. The restaurant Stara Skadarlija, two authentic walls of the brewery, the old tower and shopping mall, boiler room and lagums will be preserved but with additional functions. The tower will be illuminated and visible from the city neighborhoods below. The shopping mall's higher floors will be turned into a hotel. Lagums will be open for the public and turned into souvenir and gift shops. The atrium will be turned into a new commercial shopping mall and a hotel with subterranean garage of parking spaces. Water springs will be co- opted and protected, and new drills will be added to the existing three springs, as a sort of a tourist attraction. The most controversial aspect at the moment appears to be the concept of a glass box-shaped membrane, lit from the inside, which is supposed to engulf the Stara Skadarlija restaurant. The idea is opposed by the local population. Except for Stara Skadarlija, changes will mainly occur in the side from the Cetinjska street which is considered a low preservation urban area, unlike the Skadarlija side, which is protected by the law and no new construction works will be allowed. As the altitude difference from top to bottom of the projected area is , it is de facto going to be step-like dug into the ground for almost three floors. The project was scrapped in the later years due to the unsolved property ownership issues, as the BIP sold the brewery to the Italian company \\"Star Immobiliare\\" in 2006 which in turn sold it to the British \\"Invest Balkan Properties PLC\\" in 2007. Company \\"Elgin\\" acquired the building in 2010. They claimed that by the end of 2011, they will announce which of the world-famous hotel chains will build a hotel but nothing happened. = 2017-2019 reconstruction = Instead, reconstruction of the street was announced by the city government in October 2016, as the cobblestones and the fa√ßades became damaged in time. Works were scheduled for the spring of 2017, but were moved to October 2017, as the city decided to accept the proposition of the kafana owners to postpone it until after the touristic season is over. However, they decided to renovate the drinking fountain, which was to be finished in July 2017. As the fountain is at the beginning of the street, the tourists routinely avoid the street thinking it is completely closed, while those who enter the restaurants' terraces and gardens often leave as the dust is everywhere, especially in the initial section of the street. The number of visitors dwindled and the restaurateurs accused the city administration of \\"ruining the 2017 season\\". The fountain was restored according to the original 1966 project of Bogunoviƒá and Ribnikar, and the works were finished on 7 July 2017, 10 days ahead of the schedule. The stone fountain, which was built on the location of an old, one- pipe fountain from the Ottoman period, was fully renovated and the stone bench made of the yellow Ljig sandstone, which was projected in 1966, was finally built. Further reconstruction began on 16 October 2017 and was projected to last until the spring of 2018. In November 2017 photos appeared showing that the trademark stone kaldrma has been removed and that street was paved with the asphalt concrete. It prompted a major public outburst and protests, so the city authorities explained that the asphalt is just the substrate and that stones will be washed and placed on top of the asphalt. As the works were under the tougher public scrutiny since then, it was obvious that the old stone was replaced with the new, imported one, produced in Greece in 2016. City then announced that the old and new stones will be mixed, but instead of a colorful stones of the old kaldrma, the new one is uniformly gray, described as the \\"dark shroud, in contrast to the previous playful and diverse one, which took [from Skadarlija] its joy and vibrancy and killed its Dionysian spirit\\". In the lower half, which was done by December, only the new stones were used. The customs paper show that the stone was imported only after the asphalt pavement was finished and public protests. The reconstruction was halted again in the spring of 2018 because of the opening of the touristic season, and was continued in October 2018. Deadline for this phase was mid- December 2018, but when deadline approached, it was obvious that the works are not going to be finished. Despite holiday season, the works left majority of the quarter even without the basic, street lights. Additionally, works on almost all cross streets began in April and were to be finished by October, but that wasn't finished either, so the association of the local restaurant and caf√© owners again reported declining income due to the dug streets. They negotiated with the city administration a temporary halt of the works during winter holidays. By September 2019, less than a year since the works were finished, the street was clearly disintegrating, showing the low quality of works and imported Greek stone. After both traditional and social media reported this, despite deputy mayor Goran Vesiƒá stated in March 2018 that the final, third phase starts in October 2018, city now claims that the entire reconstruction will have phases 4 and 5, though they were not mentioned before and nothing is known about them..  Characteristics  Tri ≈°e≈°ira restaurant The present Skadarlija, a short and curved street, is a remarkable Belgrade tourist attraction. It includes well-known restaurants, hotels (e.g. Le Petit Piaf), art galleries, antique and souvenir shops. At the end of the street there is the Sebilj fountain. It is an ornamented drinking fountain, copy of the Sebilj fountain in Ba≈°ƒçar≈°ija in Sarajevo, and gift from Sarajevo to Belgrade. Groups playing Serbian brass or traditional urban music and actors dressed in traditional Serb costumes perform down the street. Unlike other similar and popular places in Belgrade that are considered posh, Skadarlija is known as a place visited by young couples and entire families with children. Restaurants offer the typical national cuisine, most notably the ro≈°tilj (grilled meat) with pivo (beer). Skadarlija's caf√©s, restaurants, art exhibits and cobblestone (kaldrma) promenade attract up to people daily. The street is a car-free zone but it would be unsuited for traffic anyway because it is too narrow and with bumpy cobblestones. = Bohemian life = Putujuƒái glumac restaurant along Skadarska street. Well-known but mostly poor poets and writers became regular visitors of Skadarlija in the early 20th century, not just from Serbia but from the wider Yugoslav areas, even before the Yugoslav state was formed as such in 1918. The most prominent residents and visitors in Skadarlija's bohemian history include ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá, Dobrica Milutinoviƒá, ≈Ωanka Stokiƒá, Ilija Stanojeviƒá, Tin Ujeviƒá, Gustav Krklec, Stevan Sremac, Antun Gustav Mato≈°, Zuko D≈æumhur, Momo Kapor and Silvana Armenuliƒá. After decades of performing in Skadarlija's restaurants and outdoors, some singers and performers became synonymous with Skadarlija: singers ≈†aban ≈†auliƒá, Toma Zdravkoviƒá, Olga Janƒçevecka, Divna ƒêokiƒá, Sofka Vasiljkoviƒá, Mila Matiƒá, actress Ljubica Janiƒáijeviƒá who impersonated Gypsy fortune-tellers, and Radomir ≈†obota as a drummer.Skadarlija - duh boemije koji i≈°ƒçezava; RTS documentary on Skadarlija; 2008 Restaurants are proud of their lists of worldwide celebrities and epicurians who visited them over the decades. Even Alfred Hitchcock ended his diet in Skadarlija . Often, they post photographs of their visits on the walls. For example, over the years, Tri ≈°e≈°ira welcomed numerous famous guests such as guitarist Jimi Hendrix, politicians George H.W. Bush, Josip Broz Tito, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, Sandro Pertini, and chess player Anatoly Karpov. Other celebrities who visited Skadarlija include queen Elizabeth II, politicians Willy Brandt, Gianni de Michelis, Helmut Kohl, Hans- Dietrich Genscher, Yevgeny Primakov, Igor Ivanov and Margaret Thatcher, author Alberto Moravia, actors Burt Lancaster, Vladimir Visotsky, Gina Lollobrigida, Alain Delon, film director Nikita Mikhalkov, etc. Visitors from the later period include Joe Biden and Johannes Hahn. As similar bohemian quarters, Skadarlija and Parisian Montmartre twinned on 22 October 1977. A group of French artists visited Belgrade to mark the occasion. They were joined by large crowds of Belgraders, and they formed a joint procession which walked from the Monument of Gratitude to France in Kalemegdan Park, through Knez Mihailova Street and Republic Square, to Skadarlija. The photos of the event are kept in the archive of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Two identical plaques, commemorating the event, are placed in May 1978. In Montmartre, the plaque is placed on the building of the Free Commune of Montmartre while artist Branimir Bane Miniƒá, who authored the plaque, was dubbed the Knight of Montmartre. In Belgrade, the plaque is placed across the house of ƒêura Jak≈°iƒá. Since 1993, the official opening of the summer season in Skadarlija (restaurants are open the entire year) has been marked by rising a \\"bohemian flag\\". The flagpole is located in front of the Zlatni bokal restaurant. The ceremony is always attended by celebrities, including popular and opera singers, actors, and artists. The season usually begins in the late April/early May. There is a special code of conduct for the restaurants and their employees. The code was rescinded in 1975 but was reintroduced in 2010. It includes the types of dishes that can be found on the menues, what types of uniforms, table clothes or music are allowed and the knowledge of foreign languages. The entire season consists of a series of festivities and celebrations: Summer Saint Nicholas Feast, Skadarlija Fest, Flower Festival (Festival cveƒáa), Hat Festival (≈†e≈°irijada), Tamburica Fest, Miss Skadarlija Paegeant, children's cooking festival Varjaƒçiƒái (visited by Jamie Oliver), wine exhibitions, painting and poetry evenings, theatrical shows, Snail Race for choosing the slowest bicycle rider, dancing shows for the old-style dances, etc. The symbol of Skadarlija is a Fedora-type hat. There are numerous folk songs which mention the hat, they are dedicated to it or named after it. This especially goes for the songs in the style of starogradska muzika, which is another emblematic feature of Skadarlija. = Greenmarket = At the end of the street, across the Du≈°anova Street, there is an open farmers market, officially named Skadarlija market. Until the 19th century it was a boggy area, where two streams, flowing down the two modern streets of Skadarlija (Bibijin potok) and Cetinjska, were bringing water from the sources close to the modern \\"Politika\\" building. The area was known at the time as Vidinsko Poljanƒçe (\\"Vidin Little Field\\"). In time, eastern section of the Skadarlija neighborhood, along the Cetinjska Street, was urbanized. It consisted of small houses, with yards and \\"obligatory\\" lilacs. Predating the market was a kafana \\"Bajlonov Kladenac\\" (Bajloni's water well). The market developed spontaneously in the 19th century for the customers from the lower Dorƒáol neighborhood, for whom the central city market, the Great Market, was too distant and uphill. It was established on an empty lot in front of the Filip's Brewery, which was later renamed to Bajloni Brewery. Due to his brewery, and a fact that he organized the draining of the marsh, after World War I the market became known as the Bajloni Market (Bajlonijeva pijaca). In 1926 the Great Market was finally closed and city founded several new markets throughout the city, further from the downtown: Zeleni Venac, Kaleniƒá and Jovanova market. In the process, the Bajloni market was also adapted that year: it got new market stalls, a fence, quality stores for the meat, eggs and dairy products and improved hygiene. Though officially named Skadarlija market after World War II, the citizens refer to the market only as Bajloni.

Life Bauer was born in K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia, and raised in Marburg, where his father was a professor. He studied theology at the universities of Marburg, Strassburg, and Berlin. Bauer taught at Breslau and G√∂ttingen, where he later died. Teachings In his Rechtgl√§ubigkeit und Ketzerei im √§ltesten Christentum (T√ºbingen 1934; a second edition, edited by Georg Strecker, T√ºbingen 1964, was translated as Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity 1971), Bauer developed his thesis that in earliest Christianity, orthodoxy and heresy do not stand in relation to one another as primary to secondary but, in many regions, heresy is the original manifestation of Christianity. Bauer reassessed as a historian the overwhelmingly dominant viewBauer (1964:3f) instanced Origen, Commentarius II in Cant., and Sel. in Proverb. and Tertullian, De praescript. haer. 36 as espousing the traditional theory of the relation of heresy. that for the period of Christian origins, ecclesiastical doctrine already represented what is primary, while heresies, on the other hand somehow are a deviation from the genuine (Bauer, \\"Introduction\\"). Bauer's translator, Robert A. Kraft, characterized his sophisticated, nuanced writing style, which :presents a complex and frustrating problem for the translator who hopes to capture something of the \\"tone\\" or \\"flavor\\" of the original as well as representing accurately its content. Bauer writes in a dynamic and highly sophisticated manner, mixing precision with irony and even insinuation, pictorial language with careful presentation of the historical evidence, hypotheses and caveats with the subtle use of overstatement and understatement in cleverly nuanced expressions. His German is literary but not necessarily formal. Long sentences with closely interrelated parts appear alongside brief, sometimes cryptic or oblique comments couched in clever, often scholarly German idiom. Frequently the presentation flows along rapidly in an exciting manner, despite the difficulties of the subject matter‚Äî but its flow is such that the motion is difficult to capture in translation, and is sometimes even difficult to follow in the original. Through studies of historical records Bauer concluded that what came to be known as orthodoxy was just one of numerous forms of Christianity in the early centuries. It was the eventual form of Christianity practiced in the 4th century that influenced the development of orthodoxySee Bauer's concise epitome of Rechtgl√§ubigkeit in Bauer, Aufs√§tze und Kleine Schriften, Georg Strecker, ed. T√ºbingen, 1967, pp 229-33. and acquired the majority of converts over time. This was largely due to the conversion to Christianity of the Roman Emperor Constantine I and consequently the greater resources available to the Christians in the eastern Roman empire capital he established (Constantinople). Practitioners of what became orthodoxy then rewrote the history of the conflict making it appear that this view had always been the majority one. Writings in support of other views were systematically destroyed. Bauer's conclusions contradicted nearly 1600 years of writing on church history and thus were met with much skepticismReviews and responses to Bauer are cited in Georg Strecker, \\"Die Aufnahme des Buches\\" in Rechtgl√§ubigkeit, 1964, pp 288-306; a \\"completely revised and expanded version of Strecker's essay by Robert A. Kraft appears in the English translation, 1971, pp 286-316; see also Daniel J. Harrington, \\"The Reception of Walter Bauer's \\"Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earliest Christianity\\" during the Last Decade\\", The Harvard Theological Review 73.1/2 (January - April 1980), pp. 289-298. among Christian academics such as Walther V√∂lker. The cultural isolation of Nazi Germany precluded a wider dissemination of Bauer's ideas until after World War II; in the international field of biblical scholarship, Bauer continued to be known solely as the compiler of the monumental W√∂rterbuch zu den Schriften des Neuen Testaments (in its English translation A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature or simply the Bauer Lexicon), which has become standard.

Like SIMCOS and TUTSIM, ACSL is a dialect of the Continuous System Simulation Language (CSSL), originally designed by the Simulation Councils Inc (SCI) in 1967 in an attempt to unify the continuous simulations field.  Language highlights  ACSL is an equation-oriented language consisting of a set of arithmetic operators, standard functions, a set of special ACSL statements, and a MACRO capability which allows extension of the special ACSL statements. ACSL is intended to provide a simple method of representing mathematical models on a digital computer. Working from an equation description of the problem or a block diagram, the user writes ACSL statements to describe the system under investigation. An important feature of ACSL is its sorting of the continuous model equations, in contrast to general purpose programming languages such as Fortran where program execution depends critically on statement order. The Magnolia mathematical modeling environment implements a modified version of the ACSL language, which includes capabilities for composing large models from smaller, reusable model components.  Typical applications  Applications of ACSL in new areas are being developed constantly. Typical areas in which ACSL is currently applied include control system design, aerospace simulation, chemical process dynamics, power plant dynamics, plant and animal growth, toxicology models, vehicle handling, microprocessor controllers, and robotics.

Taho () is a Philippine snack food made of fresh soft/silken tofu, arnibal (sweetener and flavoring), and sago pearl (similar to tapioca pearls). This staple comfort food is a signature sweet and taho peddlers can be found all over the country. The Indonesian and Thai equivalent of this snack is Tauhue, and the Malaysian equivalent of this snack is called Taufufah.  History  Through early records, it is evident that taho traces its origin to the Chinese douhua (Chinese: Ë±ÜËä±; pinyin: d√≤uhuƒÅ). The dish was introduced to the Philippines and other Southeast Asian countries by historical Chinese migration.  Processing and preparation  Most taho vendors prepare the separate ingredients before dawn. The main ingredient, fresh soft/silken tofu, is processed to a consistency that is very similar to a very fine custard. The brown sugar is caramelized and mixed with water to create a viscous amber- colored syrup called arnibal. Flavors, like vanilla are sometimes added to the arnibal. Sago pearls, purchased from the local market, are boiled to a gummy consistency until they are a translucent white. In lieu of making soft tofu from scratch, one can use a soft tofu mix from the store. Leftover taho, if significant amounts are found, are sometimes repurposed into Tokwa. Marketing The Magtataho (taho vendor) is a common sight in the Philippine streets. A magtataho carries two large aluminum buckets that hang from each end of a carrying pole. The larger bucket carries the tofu base; the smaller bucket holds the arnibal and sago pearls. Taho vendors peddle their product in a distinctive manner, calling its name in a full, rising inflection as they walk at a leisurely pace on the sidewalk or along the side of the road. Most magtataho keep a habitual route and schedule, often calling out \\"Tahoooooo!\\" to attract a customer's attention. Though vendors are most likely to ply their routes early in the morning, it is not uncommon for a magtataho to be spotted in the late afternoon or evening as well. Most magtataho carry plastic cups, often in two sizes, and spoons (sometimes straws) for their product. Some customers in residential areas tend to use their own cups, and the vendors price their product accordingly (The price usually costs around 20 Php for a standard-sized mug). Using a wide, shallow metal watch glass-shaped scoop, they skim the surface of the bean curd and toss out any excess water, before scooping the bean curd itself into a cup. Then, using a long, thin metal ladle, they scoop sago or tapioca pearls and arnibal into the cup, loosely mixing it in. Eating Taho is enjoyed either with a spoon, sipping it with a straw, or by simply slurping it straight from the cup. Though traditionally served warm, cold varieties exist in supermarkets and food stalls in cafeterias with bean curd in a solid, unbroken state. These pre-packed cups, sold with a plastic spoon or wooden ice pop stick, tend to contain a firmer tofu. Varieties In Baguio, there is also a strawberry variety of taho, wherein strawberry syrup is used instead of arnibal. Other varieties are white cane sugar syrup, or chocolate flavor.

It lies southeast of Bougainville (part of Papua New Guinea, west of Santa Isabel and north of Vella la Vella, Kolombangra & New Georgia. In the 2009 national census its population is 26,372. The province consists of three major islands, which are Choiseul, Wagina, and Rob Roy. Choiseul Island, which is commonly known as Lauru to the natives, has land area of , Wagina at , and Rob Roy at . Taro Island at , is the capital of the province. History =Discovery and naming= When the natives first arrived and discovered the big island, they called it Lauru. Then, in 1568, the Spanish explorer √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira rediscovered the island and named it San Marcos ('Saint Mark'). Mendana himself never set foot on Lauru. He called it San Marcos, because he saw the island from Santa Isabel on the Day of Saint Mark. 200 years later in 1768, the French explorer Louis Antoine de Bougainville saw the island again and named it Choiseul after the Minister of foreign affairs and statesman Choiseul. Today, the two most common names for the island are Choiseul and Lauru. San Marcos is not commonly used at this present day. =Colonial era= Choiseul Province was initially not part of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate (BSIP). Like Buka, Bougainville (both now part of Papua New Guinea's North Solomons Province), Santa Isabel, and the Ontong Islands, it was part of the German Solomon Islands in 1884. Fifteen years later, in 1899, Germany ceded Choiseul, Isabel and Ontong Java to the British to become part of the British Solomon Islands. In 1900, Charles Woodford, the Resident Commissioner for the Solomon Islands sailed to Choiseul via Isabel on a ship named Torch and planted the British flag on Choiseul on 23 August 1900.

Robertson Qalokale (2020) *vacant Mostly, these MPs don't work together well: due to the strong pressure from Kinship Politics, which was strongly influenced by laziness and dependencies by the electorates (enabled by a low literacy, in regard to its total population). =Administrative subdivisions= The Choiseul Province is sub-divided into the following wards: * Choiseul Province (26,372) **Wagina (1,636) **Katupika (1,988) **Vasipuki (1,574) **Viviru (1,499) **Babatana (1,746) **Tepazaka (1,680) **Batava (4,931) **Tavula (2,487) **Polo (1,719) **Bangera (1,158) **Susuka (1,726) **Senga (1,848) **Kerepangara (1,140) **Kirugela (1,240)  Infrastructure  =Health= The Choiseul Provincial Health Service (CPHS) has 26 health facilities around the province. The main referral provincial hospital is the Taro Hospital. The hospital is based on the Taro Island which is also the island capital of the province. It is the first certified Baby Friendly Hospital in the Solomon Islands in October 2010. And awarded the shield by UNICEF and WHO. The award means that Taro Hospital advocates for exclusive breastfeeding for babies up to six months before introduction of soft diet. The hospital also does not encourage artificial and bottle feeding of babies. It also has links to community groups that support, protect and promote the practice of exclusive breast feeding of babies within Taro Hospital catchment area. The Choiseul Provincial Health Service is also very active in health promotion and education targeting the rural population. It pays emphasis on preventative activities down to the rural areas with the help of community groups, churches and donor partners. Taro Hospital offers the following primary health programs, reproductive health on ante natal and post natal care, childhealth on immunization, nutrition and breastfeeding practices, non communicable disease, mental health services and malaria program. =Telecommunication= Solomon Telekom Company Limited is the sole provider of both landline and mobile phone communication in the province. Telekom's office is in Taro. Landline phone communication can only be found only on Taro Island. However, Telekom also covers the island with mobile phone towers. Currently, its mobile phone towers are in Pangoe Village, Kagaloga, Sasamuqa and Wagina. In June 2014, Our Telekom added two new mobile towers, one on Ropa Island, in South Choiseul and the second at Ogho village, North West Choiseul. Two way VHF radio can also be found in the villages, churches, schools and clinics.  Culture  =Religion= The first missionaries that came to Choiseul were the Methodists. The first attempt by the Methodist Ministers led by Rev John Goldie was made in 1904, but, was unsuccessful. In 1905, a second attempt was made by Rev Stephen Rabone Rooney, this time on the South of Choiseul at Sasamuqa, which was successful, leading to the first mission established in Sasamuqa village in 1905. The missionaries were instrumental in the introduction of education and health to the population. The three denominations involved in Missionary work in Choiseul were the Methodists, Catholics and the Seventh Day Adventists.\\" Deaconess Iula Qilanoba, the first Methodist deaconess from the Solomon Islands, was a native of Choiseul Province. =People= The people consists of several Melanesian tribes including the Gilbertese who live on Wagina. In the 19th century head hunting and blackbirding were widespread in the Solomon Islands. This led to the extinction of the people on Wagina in the 1870s. Even in the 20th century the Choiseul islanders were ill-reputed as brutal cannibals so that visitors only came with armed forces to that island. In 1916 there were brutal feuds between the several tribes which were ended by the peace treaty of Sasamungga on 8 August 1921. This event, called Kulabule, is a holiday on Choiseul. = Music= Traditionally, people in Choiseul use bamboos for traditional flutes. Now these traditional music is only performed in custom ceremonies. One of the string bands from Choiseul was the Sirovanga Boys. Their best known song being \\"seni memory.\\" Another group from Choiseul in the early 2000s was the band Savoto. Their hit songs include \\"inaka mach\\" and \\"Ke siro.\\" =Football= The inhabitants of Choiseul are soccer enthusiasts. They have a team called Lauru Kuvojo, which in 2005 took part at the Solomon-Cup, the national football championship of the Solomon Islands. They have finished their participation already in the preliminary round. In November 2012 the bi-annual Kuvojo Cup was held with a team representing the provincial capital Taro winning against a team from Senga ward. Most of the 14 wards throughout Choiseul sent representative teams to participate at the Kuvojo Cup tournament in both soccer and netball.  Geography and environment  =Flora and fauna= The flora and fauna are both characteristic of Australia and New Guinea. The biggest mammal is the endangered dugong, a seacow which occurs in the waters near Rob Roy and Taro Island. The largest reptile is the saltwater crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) known from Australia. Known birds are the Sanford's fish eagle (Haliaeetus sanfordi), the Pacific black duck (Anas superciliosa), and the eastern reef egret (Egretta sacra). Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the only habitat of the now extinct Choiseul crested pigeon (Microgoura meeki). Choiseul is also an important breeding place for the loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). The flora is represented by mangroves and coconuts. =Environmental issues= Commercial logging continues to operate in Choiseul throughout the entire province. Nickel Mining is planned to commence in 2016 in Katupika and will see over cleared to gain access to nickel deposits over the life of the mining operation. Prospecting for gold has also occurred close to Susuka in north Choiseul.Choiseul Province Medium Term Development Plan 2012-2014 A proposal to establish over in north Choiseul as oil palm plantation will also have significant environmental impact. =Islands= * Bembalama * Choiseul * Cyprian Bridge * Kaghau * Laena * Nanagho * Nuatambu * Rob Roy * Saerema * Taro * Moli Island * Zinoa Islands * Supizae Island * Parama Island * Butuburu Island * Kundakaniboko Island * Wagina References = Reference bibliography = * External links * Information about Choiseul (engl.) * History of Choiseul (engl.) * WorldStatesmen- Solomon Islands & includes flag * Exploring Solomons - Choiseul page Category:Provinces of the Solomon Islands Category:States and territories established in 1995 ","title":"Choiseul Province"},{"id":"3614300","text":"Knez Mihailova Street, properly Kneza Mihaila ( / Ulica knez Mihailova or –£–ª–∏—Ü–∞ –∫–Ω–µ–∑–∞ –ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª–∞ / Ulica kneza Mihaila, ), is the main pedestrian and shopping zone in Belgrade, and is protected by law as one of the oldest and most valuable landmarks of the city. Named after Mihailo Obrenoviƒá III, Prince of Serbia, it features a number of buildings and mansions built during the late 1870s. One kilometer long Knez Mihailova Street was in 1979 included on the list of Spatial Cultural-Historical Units of Great Importance, and as such is protected by the Republic of Serbia.  History  = Roman period = The street follows the central grid layout of the Roman city of Singidunum, as one of the main access roads to the city corresponds to the modern street today. Ihe main axis of urban development was along the street, which was the main route of communication (via cardo). The original earthen and wooden fort stretched around the Studentski Trg and Knez Mihailova Street. The oldest Roman graves were discovered in this section, dated to the 1st and early 2nd century. Thermae were located in the ƒåika Ljubina Street. Also in the ƒåika Ljubina, remains of the house from the 4th century was discovered in 2008, which included the part of the floor and doorstep of the main entry door. Parts of the walls were decorated with frescoes. An aqueduct was used to conduct water from the modern Kumodra≈æ area. At some point it was joining the aqueduct from the Mokri Lug and then continued further to the castrum. Both Mokri Lug and Kumodra≈æ are hills, so the natural inclination allowed for the water to flow downhill to Singidunum. Aqueducts passed through the modern center of Belgrade, Terazije, and along the Knez Mihailova. When digging for the future Rajiƒáeva shopping mall began in 2004, remains of the antique and late antique layers were discovered, so as the remains of the southwest rampart route and double trench in the direction of Kralja Petra Street. The trench from the 3rd century was buried and full of coins, lamps, ceramics and jars. Next to this locality, at the corner of Knez Mihailova and Kralja Petra, an area paved with the cobblestone dating from the 2nd century was discovered. It was a public space, located right before the entrance into the fortress. During almost every construction in Knez Mihailova and the neighboring streets where digging is involved, remains are being discovered. In 2008 in ƒåika Ljubina Street remains of the house from the 4th century was discovered, which included the part of the floor and doorstep of the main entry door. Part of the walls was decorated with frescoes. Similar findings are discovered in Kosanƒçiƒáev Venac and Tadeu≈°a Ko≈°ƒáu≈°kog. Remnants of the Roman castrum from the 2nd century were discovered beneath Tadeu≈°a Ko≈°ƒáu≈°kog during the reconstruction in June 2009. They were conserved and reburied. In Cincar Jankova Street, five graves from the late 1st century were discovered so as the three canals. Archaeologists expected to find a southeastern route of the castrum ramparts, but due to the mass wasting in the area and the leveling of the terrain, the route was destroyed in time. = Ottoman and Austrian occupations = During Ottoman occupation, in the first half of the 16th century, the Ottomans repaired the old Roman aqueduct and built a new one along the street with drinking fountains, as the neighborhoods could not develop without the water. They also built gardens and five mosques with adjoining mahalas. When Austrians occupied Belgrade in 1717 they demolished the old houses and mosques and built new buildings. = 19th century = Ruling prince of Serbia Alexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá, built a drinking fountain (ƒçesma), which became known as the Delijska fountain, after the name of the street at the time. It was demolished and built three times in the 19th century. The fourth reincarnation of the fountain, which stands today, was built in 1987 within the scopes of a major reconstruction of the street, which adapted it into the pedestrian zone. The present fountain is not on the same location as the old ones and is not identical in terms of architecture, but kept many elements from the old projects. The street wasn't a continuous thoroughfare at the time, but was a succession of smaller alleys. Apart from Delijska Street, which was named during the Ottoman times, other sections were named by the Ministry of the Interior on 8 February 1848: Kalemegdanska (section from the modern Kralja Petra Street to the Kalemegdan Park) and Vojvodina (from the Kralja Petra to the Terazije). A short section of the Delijska Street remained and is today parallel with the modern Kneza Mihaila. It is the only Belgrade street whose name survived from the Ottoman period. In the middle of the 19th century, the upper part of the street bordered the garden of Prince Alexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. After the implementation of the 1867 city of Belgrade regulation plan by Emilijan Josimoviƒá, the street soon gained its current look and architecture. Josimoviƒá‚Äôs plan marked the beginning of the city‚Äôs broader metamorphosis from oriental to the western urbanism. Prior to Josimoviƒá, only a short part of what is today Knez Mihailova, called ‚Ä≥Delijska street‚Ä≥, actually existed as a street. Works on construction of the new street began in spring of 1869. Josimoviƒá's plan successfully transformed the existing incomplete trail into the proper street which directly connected downtown Belgrade with the fortress, thus establishing a direct communication between the inner and outer neighborhoods. City founded its first street naming commission in 1864. The commission worked for 6 years, and the Knez Mihailova was the first street they named. Houses were built there by the most influential and wealthiest families of the Serbian society, most of them merchants. In 1870, two years after the assassination of Prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá, the city authorities officially named the street - Ulica Kneza Mihaila (Prince Michael Street) instead of ‚Ä≥Delijska‚Ä≥. The Hajduk Veljko kafana situated on the street, was the first location where the Belgraders could hear the phonograph, in 1896, while in 1906 it became the first cinema in the city. = 20th century = Knez Mihailova Street is converted into a pedestrian zone In the early 20th century, a wealthy merchant Vlada Mitiƒá opened the first department store in Belgrade at No. 41. It was the first building specifically projected to be a large, modern store. Mitiƒá implemented the novelties like the delay in payment and modernized advertising of the goods. In the late 20th century, from mostly shopping area it evolved into the cultural center of the city. In 1987 there was a major reconstruction of Knez Mihailova and its transformation into the pedestrian zone. After six months of construction works, the street was open on 20 October 1987. It was paved with the black granite slabs from Jablanica, while a drinking fountain, made of white marble from Venƒçac, was erected in memory of former Delijska fountain which was further down the street. Previously nonexistent oak avenue through the middle of the street was also introduced, so as vintage looking candelabra which resemble the historical, gas ones. Commemorative plaque for Emilijan Josimoviƒá was placed near the ‚ÄúRuski car‚Äù restaurant. During the reconstruction, when the old pavement was removed, an old plaque dedicated to the young volunteers who reconstructed the street in 1949, was found and the two plaques are now exhibited next to each other. In 1988 area around the Palace Albania, Hotel Majestic and ‚ÄúJadran‚Äù cinema were also reconstructed, and a new fountain and mini-amphitheatre were placed in the section of the street where it enters the Republic Square. Entire project of the reconstruction was developed by architect and urbanist Branislav Jovin. Reportedly, as of mid-2010s, much of the street's real estate is owned by Serbian tycoons of the day such as Dragan ƒêuriƒá, Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá, Miodrag Kostiƒá, Philip Zepter, Radomir ≈Ωivaniƒá, Vojin Lazareviƒá, Tahir Hasanoviƒá, and Radivoje Dra≈æeviƒá and it houses their respective business holdings.Oni su vlasnici Knez Mihailove;Blic, 29 June 2014 = Notable buildings = SANU headquarters in Knez Mihailova Corner with \\"Ruski car\\" restaurant *Srpska Kruna Hotel, located at 56 Knez Mihailova Street, was built in 1869 in the style of romanticism. At the time it was considered Belgrade's most modern hotel. Between 1945 and 1970 the National Library of Serbia was located in this building. Today, the building houses the City of Belgrade library. *Marko Stojanoviƒá's house, 53-55 Knez Mihailova Street, was built in 1889 as a private home of lawyer Marko Stojanoviƒá, in the renaissance style. The Academy of Fine Arts, established in 1937, used to be in the building but now the Gallery of the Academy is located there. *Block of private homes, 46, 48 and 50 Knez Mihailova Street, built in the 1870s, represented the beginning of discontinuity with traditional \\"Balkan\\" architecture. Each of the three buildings are shaped in the same manner, a transitional style from romantism to renaissance. The block consists of three buildings: **Hristina Kumanudi's house, located at 50 Knez Mihailova Street, was built in 1870 as a corner building at the intersection of Kneza Mihaila and Dubrovaƒçka (later renamed Kralja Petra Street) streets by the Serbian merchant and banker of Greek origin Jovan Kumanudi who was also a prominent real estate investor and developer. Before it got built, an existing one-story house at the spot (Jovan Kumanudi's private residence where he also had a shop) got demolished. Kumanudi named the new building after his wife Hrisanta aka Hristina. For a certain period in the late 19th century, the newly erected building housed the French-Serbian Bank, and later the consulates of Belgium and Great Britain. The building was later purchased by Nikola D. Kiki (1841-1918), a Belgrade merchant of Aromanian origin. After his death, in his testament, he signed the building (along with two other city properties) over to the organization named Beogradska trgovaƒçka omladina (Belgrade Merchant Youth) under conditions that they use the funds generated by the three properties to set up a hospital named The Nikola and Evgenija Kiki Endowment, which Kiki envisioned would provide medical help and services to poor and downtrodden merchants. Between 1937 and 1940, a hospital was built at 9 Zveƒçanska Street. **Kristina Mehana, located at 48 Knez Mihailova Street, built in 1869 as an administrative- commercial building in which Krstiƒá brothers opened a hotel under the same name, and where meetings of the Belgrade City Assembly took place until the construction of the Assembly's own building. Today, the building houses the offices of Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO), Mona clothing store, Plato bookstore, and since 2004 Via del Gusto restaurant. **Veljko Saviƒá's house, located at 46 Knez Mihailova Street, built in 1869 as a residential house with shops. It underwent many changes from its original look. *The Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts' building, located at 35 Knez Mihailova Street, built from 1923 to 1924 according to the 1912 plans by Dragutin ƒêorƒëeviƒá and Andra Stevanoviƒá, in academic style with elements of secession. The building houses the Academy's library, one of the richest in Belgrade, as well as the Academy's archives containing numerous materials about the Serbian history, and furthermore on the ground floor ‚Äî the Academy's gallery along with a lecture hall, bookstore, and antique shop. *Nikola Spasiƒá Endowment building, 33 Knez Mihailova Street, built in 1889, by the designs of the architect Konstantin Jovanoviƒá in the renaissance style, as a residential house of Belgrade merchant Nikola Spasiƒá (1840-1916). *Nikola Spasiƒá Passage, 19 Knez Mihailova Street, built in 1912 in Secession style. *Grƒçka Kraljica (Greek Queen) coffee shop, 51 Knez Mihailova Street, built in 1835 in style of academism. One of the oldest preserved buildings in Belgrade's old core, it originally housed an inn named Despotov Han until Jovan Kumanudi purchased it and changed its name to Kod Grƒçke kraljice (Greek Queen's). *Ruski car (Russian Emperor) caffe & restaurant, angle of Knez Mihailova and Obiliƒáev Venac streets built in 1926 in the late Art Nouveau and early Art Deco styles. *Hotel Russia, 38 Knez Mihailova Street, built in 1870 and annexed in 1920. Today it houses business offices of the \\"Rudnap\\" company. *Progres Palace, 27 Knez Mihailova Street. Former location of the decades old, famous Belgrade art gallery \\"Sebastijan\\". In 1996 city allowed for the \\"Progres\\" company to erect a building instead, but the company was conditioned by the city that a section facing the street must remain a gallery. In time, it became known as the \\"Gallery Progres\\". In June 2019, the crumbling company decided to sell the building part by part and one of the sequestered parts was a gallery, with company asking ‚Ç¨6 million for it. City administration intervened, stating that either the buyer will be obliged to continue with the stipulated use of the space as a gallery, or the city will take over the gallery space as a collectible for the debts that \\"Progres\\" has to the city. City also pushed for the gallery to be declared a cultural monument, which was confirmed by the government in August 2019. The bronze statue of Mercury on rotating pedestal, monumental staircase and other features will have to be preserved. City claims that the intention is to open a gambling house or kafana instead and asked for the government to cease the sale. \\"Progres\\" reduced the price to ‚Ç¨5.3 million, but gave up on selling in May 2020.  Today  Knez Mihailova Street at night (January 2012) Knez Mihailova is a common meeting point for Belgraders. The street has been named one of the most beautiful pedestrian zones in South East Europe and is a constant buzz of people and tourists. Thousands of people stroll along the street every day as it is the shortest path from Terazije to Kalemegdan park and fortress. The street is home to Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU), Instituto Cervantes, Goethe-Institut, Institut fran√ßais de Serbie, as well as many other leading shops and several cafes. In December 2006, BusinessWeek magazine included the street as one of Europe's notable Christmas shopping sites. One can find international clothing brands such as Mango, Zara and Zara men, Gap, Nike men and women, Replay, Diesel, Terranova, Sephora, New Look, Swarovski, Cesare Paciotti, Tally Weijl, Miss Sixty, Bata, Bally, Aldo, Adidas, Vapiano, Monsoon Accessorize and many more shops. Furthermore, the representative offices of various airlines such as Aeroflot, flydubai, Emirates, Qantas, Turkish Airlines, Qatar Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Air France are located in Knez Mihailova. In terms of real estate value, the property in and around Knez Mihailova Street is among the most expensive in Belgrade. The latest confirmation of this occurred in late November 2007 when the 485m2 parcel belonging to state owned company Jugoexport was sold for ‚Ç¨15 million, which works out to some ‚Ç¨32,000 per square meter (~ $35,741 as of August 2016 rates).Kvadrat lokala \\"Jugoeksporta\\" prodat za 32.000 evra, November 29, 2007 = Rajiƒáeva Shopping Mall = Near the end of the street, between Knez Mihailova and Uzun Mirkova, a large complex of Rajiƒáeva Shopping Mall was constructed. It was the location of the house of politician Toma Vuƒçiƒá Peri≈°iƒá. It was demolished in 1950 and the trolleybus roundabout was built, named Rajiƒáeva, after the street. In 2000 an architectural design competition for this location was announced and the winning project was the one by Milan and Vladimir Lojanica. In 2003 the trolleybuses were removed from the location and in 2009 the government's permit for construction was granted. The construction itself was troubled and long. Fellow architects were mostly against the project. Zoran Maneviƒá, former president of the Club of Architects, called it a \\"monstrosity\\" while member of the Academy of Architecture, Branko Bojoviƒá, said there are many cultural issues why it shouldn't be built, naming just one of them, the Roman remains in this entire section of Belgrade, which are shallow and conserved under the ground. Another problem was the restitution as many objects were confiscated by the Yugoslav Communist authorities after the World War II. The construction dragged on for years. Israel investor, \\"ABD\\", daughter company of \\"Ashtrom\\", cited the reasons for that as the long and complicated process of obtaining permits, unregulated property ownership, archaeological explorations and financial problems due to the global economic crisis. The complex consists of the shopping mall, the first in downtown Belgrade, with , which was open on 14 September 2017. There is also an underground garage with 450 parking spots. Much larger section, a luxurious Mama Shelter hotel with was opened in March 2018. The criticism of the project continued, both for its location in old section of Belgrade's downtown and the appearance of the building itself, which is described as an unfitting architecture for the location or as a \\"foreign body in Knez Mihailova\\". Architect Bojan Kovaƒçeviƒá said that the edifice is twice the size of what was allowed in the beginning and that, with its capacity and appearance, it is a synonymous for the violence against the city. He asked: \\"is Rajiƒáeva bringing any luck to Belgrade? Hardly\\". Writer and former ambassador Dragan Velikiƒá called it \\"architectural abomination in the heart of Belgrade - steel jaws of the shopping mall which swallowed the building of the City Library\\", referring to the edifice as the Rajiƒáeva Cave. Architect said that the project ruined both the archaeological locality and the architectural core of the city, and that the protected zone of Knez Mihailova has been degraded by it. Famous Serbian architect , however, praised the project, saying that it is the pride of the contemporary architecture in the world. The project was awarded the prize for architecture at Belgrade's Architectural Salon and architect Sne≈æana Ristiƒá wrote: \\"There is lot of arguing about this object. Ones are against the modern object in the old city core and wish to see a polished, eclectic house like the ones with the 19th- century fa√ßades; others find lots of quality in this modern edifice for the modern times; third believe that shopping mall shouldn't be built at all and that some cultural venue should have been constructed instead; fourth still have nostalgic memories of an open space and trolleybuses roundabout\\". Architect Branislav Stojkov also praised the building and the small square on the Knez Mihailova side, stating that the architect beat the investor, as the building is full of light and air.  Proposed projects  For decades, a long tunnel has been proposed in the ending section of the street. It would follow the route of the Pariska Street, between the streets of Graƒçaniƒçka and Uzun Mirkova, allowing the ground level to be turned into a plateau with a fountain. This extension of the Knez Mihailova Street would create a continuous pedestrian zone from the Terazije, Republic Square and Palace Albania to the Kalemegdan Park, the Belgrade Fortress and the rivers. It was envisioned by the first phase of the planned Belgrade Metro, 1973-1982. A bit longer version, that would go from the Graƒçaniƒçka Street to the monument of Rigas Feraios in the Tadeu≈°a Ko≈°ƒáu≈°kog Street, resurfaced in 2012, in conjunction with the project of connecting the Savamala port and the fortress. In March 2012 it was announced that the construction will start by the end of the year. However, the planners from the 1970s version were against the execution, because they believed that the entire complex could only exist, if there are already functioning subway lines, which as of 2018, are still not built. Due to the price, general halt of the subway construction and constant changes in its routes, the project hasn't materialized yet.

The province had a population of around 26,158 in 2009., mostly concentrated on the main island, Santa Isabel Island. The capital of the province is Buala on Santa Isabel Island, which has scheduled airline services to Honiara on Solomon Airlines from Fera Airport, on Fera Island, a 15-minute boat ride from Buala. The province has an economy dominated by subsistence agriculture with occasional plantations for cash crops such as copra, and by logging activities. The province is seldom visited by tourists due to poor infrastructure, lack of roads, hotels, modern medical care, and endemic malaria. Most areas have a \\"Rest House\\", a house where guests can seek accommodation for the night or two, but many residents are willing to take in visitors for the night. Santa Isabel is the longest Island in the Solomon Islands.

It was adopted into the international standard CCIR 653 (now ITU-R BT.653) of 1986 as CCIR Teletext System B. Development WST originally stems from the UK standard developed by the BBC and the UK Independent Broadcasting Authority in 1974 for teletext transmission, extended in 1976 as the Broadcast Teletext Specification. With some tweaks to allow for alternative national character sets, and adaptations to the NTSC 525-line system as necessary, this was then promoted internationally as \\"World System Teletext\\". It was accepted by CCIR in 1986 under international standard CCIR 653 (now ITU-R BT.653) as one of four recognised standards for teletext worldwide, and may now most commonly be referred to as CCIR Teletext System B. Almost all television sets sold in Europe since the early ‚Äô80s have built-in WST-standard teletext decoders as a feature. WST is used for all teletext services in Europe & Scandinavia, including Ceefax from the BBC and services from Teletext on ITV in the United Kingdom, ZDFtext from ZDF and ARDText from ARD in Germany, and Tekst-TV from NRK in Norway, among many other teletext services offered by other television networks throughout the European continent.  Levels  In the early 1980s a number of higher extension levels were envisaged for the specification, based on ideas then being promoted for worldwide videotex standards (telephone dial-up services offering a similar mix of text and graphics). The proposed higher content levels included geometrically-specified graphics (Level 4), and higher-resolution photographic-type images (Level 5), to be conveyed using the same underlying mechanism at the transport layer. No TV sets currently implement the two most sophisticated levels. = Level 1 (1976)= The initial specifications set out by the BBC, IBA, BREMA in September 1976: * Alpha-mosaic characters (drawn using a 2x3 block matrix) characters (similar to some characters of the TRS-80 character set) * spacing attributes * fixed colour palette (red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white) * support for double height or flash effect * 40 columns x 24 rows =Level 1.5 (1981)= Comparison between Teletext level 1 and 1.5 An extended version of level 1, with support for 13 extended character sets and other ASCII-like characters. *Czech & Slovak *English *Estonian *French *German *Italian *Latvian & Lithuanian *Polish *Portuguese & Spanish *Romanian *Serbian & Croatian & Slovenian *Swedish & Finnish *Turkish =Level 2 (1988)= New features: * Multi-language support * 32 colour mode. * Non-spacing attributes * Allows re-definable characters (Level 2 was replaced by level 2.5) =Level 2.5 teletext / Hi-Text (1995)= Comparison between teletext Level 1.0 and teletext Level 2.5. Comparison between teletext Level 1.0 and teletext Level 2.5. Level 2.5 or HiText. was first broadcast in 1994 by the bilingual French-German channel ARTE. With Level 2.5 it is possible to set a background colour and have higher resolution text and images. However, very few television stations transmit their teletext in this new standard. One of the problems with Level 2.5 is that it often takes several transmission cycles before the higher resolution items show on the screen. In order to watch Level 2.5 teletext, a rather recent television set with a special decoder chip is required. New features: * Multi-language support * Wider colour palette with re-definable colours (4016 colour palette) * Non-spacing attributes * Allows re-definable characters * Provides side panels for additional text or graphics in 16:9 TVs * nexTView EPG * Adopted initially by ARTE, ARD, ZDF, Bayern 3 and SwissTXT The system has not been widely implemented, with only a handful of European state broadcasters supporting it. Television stations which are known to transmit teletext in Level 2.5 include: * the Dutch public broadcaster NOS (background colour on all pages, and a test page with hi-res graphics), * the French France 3 and * the German ** ZDF (some pages), ** 3sat (some pages) ** Bayerisches Fernsehen (and formerly also now-renamed BR-alpha) (in the past on almost all pages, now only on some pages), ** phoenix (on some pages), ** B√ºrgerfernsehen Gera (background-colour on all pages, test pages 460 to 485) and ** formerly SWR Fernsehen (included completely backwards-compatible Level 2.5 teletext, with higher quality text and graphics on nearly all pages). = Level 3 = New features: * Dynamically Redefined Character Set (DRCS) allowing the display of non-Roman characters (e.g. Arabic and Chinese) * Pictorial Graphic characters can also be defined (Level 3 was replaced by level 3.5) =Level 3.5 (1997)= Extends the number of re-definable characters and their complexity and introduces different font styles and proportional spacing. New features: * Dynamically Redefined Character Set (DRCS) allowing the display of non-Roman characters (e.g. Arabic and Chinese) * Pictorial Graphic characters can also be defined * Different font styles * Proportional spacing. =Level 4 (1981)= Tested by IBA * Vector graphics in resolutions of 320x256 * Needs computing power to generate the display from a sequence of drawing instructions * 250,000 colours palette =Level 5 = Full-definition still pictures allows better quality than video cameras * Modulated onto a carrier * No noise added to the picture during transmission * Image compression used WST in the United States WST also saw some use in the United States in the 1980s, for the Electra service, which was carried on SuperStation WTBS (now TBS). It was also used for other teletext services on other television stations and networks in the USA as well. Zenith in the US also included built-in WST teletext decoders in their higher-end models of TV sets, such as their line throughout the 1980s. Also, Dick Smith Electronics offered through their American distributors a WST teletext decoder in the form of a set-top box, which was sold as a kit. This was all in competition to another teletext standard developed exclusively in North America, NABTS (North American Broadcast Teletext Standard). It was developed in Canada by Norpak, and was used by CBS for their ExtraVision service and for a very short time by NBC in the mid-1980s. However, NABTS never became as successful as WST in the American continent, since NABTS was a more advanced technology, which required a much more complicated and expensive decoder (even though it had improved graphics capability over WST).

Malaita is the most populous island of the Solomon Islands, with a population of 140,000,The National Statistics Office gives the estimated 2007 population of the whole province, including Small Malaita and other outlying islands, as 149,180. or more than a third of the entire national population. It is also the second largest island in the country by area, after Guadalcanal. A tropical and mountainous island, Malaita's pristine river systems and tropical forests have not been exploited. The largest city and provincial capital is Auki, on the northwest coast and is on the northern shore of the Langa Langa Lagoon. The people of the Langa Langa Lagoon and the Lau Lagoon on the northeast coast of Malaita call themselves wane i asi ‚Äòsalt-water people‚Äô as distinct from wane i tolo ‚Äòbush people‚Äô who live in the interior of the island. The bishop George Augustus Selwyn South Malaita Island, also known as Small Malaita and Maramasike for Areare speakers and Malamweimwei known to more than 80% of the islanders, is the island at the southern tip of the larger island of Malaita. Name Most local names for the island are Mala, or its dialect variants Mara or Mwala. The name Malaita or Malayta appears in the logbook of the Spanish explorers who in the 16th century visited the islands, and claimed that to be the actual name. They first saw the island from Santa Isabel, where it is called Mala. One theory is that \\"ita\\" was added on, as the Bughotu word for up or east, or in this context \\"there.\\"W.G. Ivens. Melanesians of the South-east Solomon Islands. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner, & Co., 1927; 22-23. Bishop George Augustus Selwyn referred to it as Malanta in 1850.Ivens, 23. Mala was the name used under British control;Ivens, 22. now Malaita is used for official purposes. The name Big Malaita is also used to distinguish it from the smaller South Malaita Island. History =Early settlement and European discovery= Malaita was, along with the other Solomon Islands, settled by Austronesian speakers between 5000 and 3500 years ago; the earlier Papuan speakers are thought to have only reached the western Solomon Islands.Alex Rukia, \\"Digging,\\" in Ples Blong Iumi, 4. However, Malaita has not been archaeologically examined, and a chronology of its prehistory is difficult to establish.Rukia, 13. In the traditional account of the Kwara'ae, their founding ancestor arrived about twenty generations ago, landed first on Guadalcanal, but followed a magical staff which led him on to the middle of Malaita, where he established their cultural norms. His descendants then dispersed to the lowland areas on the edges of the island.Rukia, 3-4. First recorded sighting by Europeans of Malaita was by the Spaniard √Ålvaro de Menda√±a on 11 April 1568. More precisely the sighting was due to a local voyage done by a small boat, in the accounts the brigantine Santiago, commanded by Maestre de Campo Pedro Ortega Valencia and having Hern√°n Gallego as pilot.Sharp, Andrew The discovery of the Pacific Islands Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1960, p.45. In his account, Gallego chief pilot of Menda√±a's expedition, establishes that they called the island Malaita after its native name and explored much of the coast, though not the north side. The Maramasiki Passage was thought to be a river. At one point they were greeted with war canoes and fired at with arrows; they retaliated with shots and killed and wounded some.Journal of Gallego, in Guppy, 219. However, after this discovery, the entire Solomon Islands chain was not found, and even its existence doubted, for two hundred years. =Labour trade and missions= After it was re-discovered in the late 18th century, Malaitans were subjected to harsh treatment from whaling boat crews and blackbirders (labour recruiters). Contact with outsiders also brought new opportunities for education. The first Malaitans to learn to read and write were Joseph Wate and Watehou, who accompanied Bishop John Coleridge Patteson to St John's College, Auckland.Joseph Waleanisia, \\"Wrigin I,\\" in Ples Blong Iumi, 34-35. From the 1870s to 1903 Malaitan men (and some women) comprised the largest number of Solomon Islander Kanaka workers in the indentured labour trade to Queensland, Australia and to Fiji. The 1870s were a time of illegal recruiting practices known as blackbirding. Malaitans are known to have volunteered as indentured labourers with some making their second trip to work on plantations, although the labour system remained exploitative. In 1901 the Commonwealth of Australia enacted the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901 which facilitated the deportation of Pacific Islanders that was the precursor to the White Australia policy. However many islanders remained and formed the South Sea Islander community of Australia. Many labourers that returned to Malaita had learnt to read and had become Christian. The skills of literacy and protest letters as to being deported from Australia was a precedent for the later Maasina Ruru movement.Weleanisia, 35-36. Many of the earliest missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant, were killed, and this violent reputation survives in the geographic name of Cape Arsacides, the eastward bulge of the northern part of the island, meaning Cape of the Assassins.Ross, 56-57 The cape was even mentioned in Herman Melville's epic novel Moby Dick by Ishmael, the novel's narrator. Ishmael talks of his friendship with the fictional Tranquo, King of Tranque. However, some of the earliest missionaries were Malaitans who had worked abroad, such as Peter Ambuofa, who was baptised at Bundaberg, Queensland in 1892, and gathered a Christian community around him when he returned in 1894. In response to his appeals, Florence Young led the first party of the Queensland Kanaka Mission (the ancestor of the SSEC) to the Solomons in 1904.Fugui and Butu, 89. Anglican and Catholic churches also missionized at this point, and set up schools in areas such as Malu'u. As the international labour trade slowed, an internal labour trade within the archipelago developed, and by the 1920s thousands of Malaitans worked on plantations on other islands.Alasia, 116. =Establishment of colonial power= At this time, there was no central power among the groups on Malaita, and there were numerous blood feuds, exacerbated by the introduction of Western guns, and steel tools which meant less time constraints for gardening.Keesing, 22. Around 1880, Kwaisulia, one of the chiefs, negotiated with labour recruiters to receive a supply of weapons in exchange of workers, based on a similar negotiation made by a chief on the Shortland Islands; this weapon supply gave the chiefs considerable power.Kent, 101-102. However, labour recruitment was not always smooth. In 1886, the vessel Young Dick was attacked at Sinerango, Malaita, and most of its crew murdered.Kent, 102. In 1886, Britain defined its area of interest in the Solomons, including Malaita, and central government control of Malaita began in 1893, when Captain Gibson R.N., of , declared the southern Solomon Islands as a British Protectorate with the proclamation of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate,Commonwealth and Colonial Law by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966. P. 897 claiming to regulate the local warfare and unfair labor trade, although it coincided with the German acquisition of territories to the west and French interest in those to the east.Ross, 57-58. Auki was established as a government station in 1909, as headquarters of the administrative district of Malaita. The government began to pacify the island, registering or confiscating firearms, collecting a head tax, and breaking the power of unscrupulous war leaders. One important figure in the process was District Commissioner William R. Bell, who was killed in 1927 by a Kwaio, along with a cadet named Lillies and 13 Solomon Islanders in his charge. A massive punitive expedition, known as the Malaita massacre, ensued; at least 60 Kwaio were killed,Keesing and Corris, 178. nearly 200 detained in Tulagi (the protectorate capital),Keesing and Corris, 184. and many sacred sites and objects were destroyed or desecrated.Keesing and Corris, 202-203 Resentment about this incident continues, and in 1983 leaders from the Kwaio area council requested that the national government demand from the United Kingdom about $100 million in compensation for the incident. When the central government did not act on this request, the council encouraged a boycott of the 1986 national elections.Alaisa, \\"Politics,\\" in Ples Blong Iumi, 142. U.S. Navy Seabees trading with natives from Malaita, 23 September 1943 World War II, which played a major role in Solomons history, did not have a major impact upon Malaita. Auki became the temporary capital when Tulagi was seized by the Japanese, and it too was briefly raided by Japan, but little fighting happened on the island. Malaitans who fought in battalions, however, brought a new movement for self-determination known as Maasina Ruru (or \\"Marching Rule\\"), which spread quickly across the island. Participants united across traditional religious, ethnic, and clan lines,Keesing and Corris, 199. lived in fortified nontraditional villages, and refused to cooperate with the British.Ross, 58-59. The organization of the movement on Malaita was considerable. The islands was divided into nine districts, roughly along the lines of the government administrative districts, and leaders were selected for each district.Kent, 145. Courts were set up, each led by a custom chief (alaha'ohu), who became powerful figures.Kent, 146. The British initially treated the movement cautiously, even praised aspects of it, but when they found there could be no common ground between the government and the movement, retaliated firmly, with armed police patrols, insisting that the chiefs recant or be arrested. Some did recant, but in September 1947 most were tried in Honiara, charged with terrorism or robbery, and convicted to years of hard labour.Kent, 148. However, the movement continued underground, and new leaders renamed the organization the Federal Council.Kent, 148-149. The High Commissioner visited Malaita to negotiate a settlement, and proposed the formation of the Malaita Council, which would have a president elected by members, though they would have to recognize the government's authority and agree to cooperate with their administrators.Kent, 149. The council became the first installment of local government in the Solomon Islands,Alaisa, 142. and its first president was Salana Ga'a. The establishment of the council reduced the tension on Malaita, although Maasina Rule elements did continue until at least 1955. The council was shown not to be simply appeasement, but submitted nearly seventy resolutions and recommendations to the High Commissioner in its first two years of existence.Kent, 150. =Post-independence= The Solomon Islands were granted independence in 1978. The first prime minister was Peter Kenilorea from 'Are'are (Malaita). The provinces were re-organized in 1981, and Malaita became the main island of Malaita Province. Malaita remains the most populous island in the country, and continues to be a source for migrants, a role it played since the days of the labour trade. There are villages of Malaitans in many provinces, including eight \\"squatter\\" settlements that make up about 15 percent of the population of Honiara, on Guadalcanal.Alasia, 118. Malaitans who had emigrated to Guadalcanal became a focus of the civil war which broke out in 1999, and the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was formed to protect their interest, both on Guadalcanal and on their home island. The organization of Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) has contributed to the infrastructure development of the island.To'abaita Authority for Research and Development (TARD) After the Solomon Islands switched diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 2019, with a delegation led by prime minister Manasseh Sogavare being received with great hostility and the provincial government refusing to discuss the topics Sogavare had originally arrived to discuss, instead airing concerns over the diplomatic switch. Mass pro-Taiwan protests broke out throughout Malaita, and some protesters even demanded independence from the Solomon Islands, sparking concerns over the fragility of the government. Geography Malaita is a thin island, about 102 miles (164 km) long and 23 miles (37 km) wide at its widest point. Its length is in a north-northwest-to-south-southeast direction, but local custom and official use generally rotate it to straight north-south orientation, and generally refer to the \\"east coast\\" or \\"northern end,\\" when northeast or northwest would be more accurate.Ross, 24. To the southwest is the Indispensable Strait, which separates it from Guadalcanal and the Florida Islands. To the northeast and east is open Pacific Ocean, except for the small Sikaiana, part of the province 212 km northeast. To the northwest of the island is Santa Isabel Island. To the immediate southwest is South Malaita Island (also called Small Malaita or Maramasike), separated by the narrow Maramasike Passage. Beyond that is Makira, the southernmost large island in the Solomon archipelago. Reef Island off North Malaita Malaita's climate is extremely wet. It is located in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (\\"Doldrums\\"), with its fickle weather patterns. The sun is at zenith over Malaita, and thus the effect is most pronounced, in November and February. Trade winds come during the Southern Hemisphere's winter, and from about April to August they blow from the southeast fairly steadily. During the summer, fringes of monsoon blow over the island. Because of the surrounding sea, air temperatures are fairly consistent, with a difference between daily highs and lows averaging to 13.6 ¬∞F However, across the year, the difference is much less; the mean daily temperature in the warmest month is only 3.4 ¬∞F warmer than that of the coolest. Rainfall is heavy and there is constant high humidity. The most common daily pattern follows an adiabatic process, with a calm, clear morning, followed by a breeze blowing in from higher pressures over the sea, culminating in a cloudy and drizzly afternoon. At night, the weather pattern reverses, and drizzle and heavy dew dissipate the cloud cover for the morning. Tropical cyclones are the only violent weather, but they can be destructive.Ross, 24-36 Like the other islands in the archipelago, Malaita is near the Andesite line and thus forms part of the Pacific Ring of Fire. Earthquakes are common on the island, but there is little evidence of current volcanic activity. The main structural feature of Malaita is the central ridge which runs along the length of the island, with flanking ridges and a few outlying hills. There is a central hilly country, between Auki and the Kwai Harbor, which separates the central ridge into northern and southern halves, the latter being somewhat longer. The northern ridge reaches a height of about 3,200 feet (975 m), while the southern goes up to 4,275 feet (1,303 m). Geologically, Malaita has a basaltic intrusive core, covered in most places by strata of sedimentary rock, especially limestone and chert, and littered with fossils. The limestone provides numerous sinkholes and caverns.Ross, 36-38 Topographical map of Malaita. Malaitan hydrology includes thousands of small springs, rivulets, and streams, characteristic of a young drainage pattern. At higher altitudes waterfalls are common, and in some places canyons have been cut through the limestone. Nearer the coasts, rivers are slower and deeper, and form mangrove swamps of brackish water, along with alluvial deposits of gravel, sand, or mud. The coastal plain is very narrow. Inland soils are of three types, wet black, dry black, and red. The wet black soil, too poorly drained for most horticulture except taro, is found in valleys or at the foot of slopes. Dry black makes the best gardening sites. The red soil, probably laterite, does not absorb runoff and forms a hard crust, and is preferred for settlement sites.Ross, 38-40 Environment There are several vegetation zones based on altitude. Along the coast is either a rocky or sandy beach, where pandanus, coconuts, and vines predominate, or a swamp, supporting mangrove and sago palms. Terminalia grows in some drier areas. The lower slopes, up to about , have a hardwood forest of banyans, Canarium, Indo- Malayan hardwoods, and, at higher altitudes, bamboo. In forested groves, there is relatively little undergrowth. In this zone is also the most intense human cultivation, which, when abandoned, a dense secondary forest grows, which is nearly impassibly thick with shrubs and softwoods. Above about is a cloud forest, with a dense carpeting of mosses, lichens, and liverworts, with cycads as the dominant tall plant. Like most Pacific islands, there are not large numbers of mammals. Apart from several species of bats, there are introduced species of pig, cuscus, and rodent. There are also dugong in the mangrove swamps, and sometimes dolphins in the lagoon. Reptiles and amphibians are common as well, especially skinks and geckos. Crocodiles were once common, but have been so frequently hunted for their hides that they are nearly extinct. There are several venomous sea snakes and two species of venomous land snakes, in the elapid family. There are also numerous species of frogs of various sizes. Fish and aquatic invertebrates are typical of the Indo-Pacific region. There are a few species of freshwater fish (including mudskippers and several other species of teleost fish), mangrove crabs and coconut crabs. On land, centipedes, scorpions, spiders, and especially insects are very common. All common orders of insects are represented, including some spectacular butterflies. The common Anopheles mosquito ensures that vivax malaria is endemic. Malaitans once believed in anthropoid apes that lived in the center of the island, which are said to be tall and come in troops to raid banana plantations.H. B. Guppy, The Solomon Islands and Their Natives, London: Swan Sonnenschein, Lowrey & Co, 1887. Page 335. There are a great number and variety of birds. Almost every family of avifauna were found in Ernst Mayr's 1931 survey.Ernst Mayr, \\"The Birds of Malaita (British Solomon Islands)\\" American Museum Novitates, 504:1-26, New York, cited in Ross, 41. Several species of parrots, cockatoos, and owls are kept as pets. Some bird species are endemic to Malaita. =Important Bird Area= The Malaita Highlands form a site that has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of threatened or endemic bird species. At 58,379 ha, it encompasses the highest peak of the island and the surrounding montane and lowland forest. Significant birds for which the site was identified include metallic pigeons, chestnut-bellied imperial pigeons, pale mountain pigeons, duchess lorikeets and the endemic red-vested myzomelas, Malaita fantails and Malaita white-eyees. Potential threats to the site include logging and human population growth. =Dolphin hunting= According to Malaitian oral history, a Polynesian woman named Barafaifu introduced dolphin drive hunting from Ontong Java Atoll; she settled in Fanalei village in South Malaita as it was the place for hunting. Dolphin hunting ceased in the mid-19th century, possibly because of the influence of Christian missionaries. However, in 1948 it was revived at settlements on several islands, including Fanalei, Walande (10 km to the north), Ata'a, Felasubua, Sulufou (in the Lau Lagoon) and at Mbita'ama harbour. In most of these communities, the hunt had ceased again by 2004. However, Fanalei in South Malaita remained the preeminent dolphin hunting village. The dolphins are hunted as food, for their teeth, and for live export. The teeth of certain species have a value for trade, brideprice ceremonial traditions, funeral feasts, and compensation. The teeth of melon-headed whale were traditionally the most desirable; however, they were over-hunted and became locally rare. The other species hunted are spinner dolphin and the pantropical spotted dolphin. While Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops aduncus) have been captured for live export, the bottlenose dolphin is not hunted as the teeth are not considered to have any value. In recent years only villages on South Malaita Island have continued to hunt dolphin. In 2010, the villages of Fanalei, Walende, and Bitamae signed a memorandum of agreement with the non- governmental organization, Earth Island Institute, to stop hunting dolphin. However, in early 2013 the agreement broke down and some men in Fanalei resumed hunting. The hunting of dolphin continued in early 2014. Researchers from the South Pacific Whale Research Consortium, the Solomon Islands Ministry of Fisheries and Marine Resources, and Oregon State University‚Äôs Marine Mammal Institute have concluded that hunters from the village of Fanalei in the Solomon Islands have killed more than 1,600 dolphins in 2013, included at least 1,500 pantropical spotted dolphins, 159 spinner dolphins and 15 bottlenose dolphins. The total number killed during the period 1976-2013 was more than 15,400. The price at which dolphin teeth are traded in Malaita rose from the equivalent of 18c in 2004 to about 90c in 2013. Demographics and culture Malaitan child A Malaitan Chief. Malaitans are of a varying phenotype. The skin varies from rich chocolate to tawny, most clearly darker than Polynesians, but not generally as dark as the peoples of Bougainville or the western Solomons, who Malaitans refer to as \\"black men\\".Ross, 46. Most have dark brown or black bushy hair, but it varies in color from reddish blond, yellow to whitish blond, to ebony black, and in texture from frizzled to merely wavy. Tourists often mistakenly believe the blond hair of Malaitans is bleached by peroxide, but this is not so; the blond or reddish hair colour is quite natural. Male-pattern baldness is widespread, but not as common as among Europeans. Most have smooth skin, but some grow hair on their arms, legs, and chest, and have beards. Most Malaitans are shorter than average Europeans, though not as short as Negritos. Relatively robust physiques are more common among coastal populations, while people from higher altitudes tend to be leaner.Ross, 46-47. =Languages and ethnic groups= Small Malaita Malaitans speak a variety of languages within the Malaitan language family, a subbranch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages. The diversity is not as great as once thought, and some of the groups are mutually intelligible. Some of the exaggeration in the number of languages may be due to the inappropriateness of lexicostatistical techniques and glottochronological analysis, given the widespread use of word taboo and metathesis as word play. According to Harold M. Ross, from north to south along the island's axis, the linguistic groups are roughly the Northern Malaita languages (more properly a collection of dialects without a standard name, generally To'abaita, Baelelea, Baegu, Fataleka, and Lau), Kwara'e in the hilly area between the ridges, Kwaio in about the geographic center of the island, and 'Are'are to the south. Each of these spreads across the width of the island. In addition, there is the Langalanga in a lagoon on the west coast between the Kwara'ae and Kwaio regions, and Kwarekwareo on the western coast between the Kwaio and 'Are'are regions, which may be a dialect of Kwaio. Sa'a, spoken on South Malaita, is also a member of the family.Ross, 48-49. Mutual intelligibility is also aided by the large degree of trade and intermarriage among the groups. The peoples of Malaita share many aspects of their culture, although they are generally divided into ethnic groups along linguistic lines. In pre-colonial times, settlements were small and moved frequently. Both agnatic descent (patrilineal lines from a founding ancestor) and cognatic descent (through links of outmarrying women) are important. These lineages determine rights of residence and land use in a complex way. In the northern area, local descent groups, united in ritual hierarchies, are largely autonomous, but conceptualize their relationship as a phratry in a manner similar to certain groups in highland New Guinea. In the central area, local descent groups are fully autonomous, though still linked by ritual. In the south, the 'Are'are people developed a more hierarchical organization and more outward orientation, a cultural tradition that reaches its peak on the hereditary chiefs and rituals of Small Malaita to the south.Keesing 10-11 One exception to these generalizations are cultures which have migrated in more recent times, such as the northern Lau, who settled in several seaside areas (and offshore islands) in southern Malaita about 200 years ago, and with whom there has been little cultural exchange.Sam Alasia, \\"Population Movement,\\" in Ples Blong Iumi, 114. =Religion= The traditional religion of the island is ancestor worship. In one oral tradition, the earliest residents knew the name of the creator, but thought his name was so holy that they did not want to tell their children. Instead, they instructed their children to address their requests to their ancestors, who would be their mediators.Leslie Fugui and Simeon Butu, \\"Religion,\\" in Ples Blong Iumi, 76. In some parts of Malaita the high god responsible for creation, who has now retired from active work, is known as Agalimae (\\"the god of the universe\\"). Congregations of local descent groups propitiate their ancestors at shrines, led by ritual officiants (fataabu in northern Malaita).Keesing, 11. On Malaita, many shrines have been preserved, not only for their sanctity but also because they serve as territorial markers that can resolve land disputes.Lawrence Foanaota, \\"Social Change,\\" in Ples Blong Iumi, 68. With European contact, Catholics and Anglicans spread their gospels, and many missionaries were killed. The Protestant South Seas Evangelical Mission (SSEM, now known as the South Seas Evangelical Church, SSEC), originally based in Queensland, made considerable inroads by following the imported workers home to their native islands. More recently, Jehovah's Witnesses and the Seventh-day Adventist Church have converted many.Ross, 57. Many Malaitans have been active in the Solomon Islands Christian Association, a national inter-denominational organization that set a precedent for cooperation during the period of independence.Leslie and Butu, 75. The Kwaio people have been the most resistant to Christianity.Keesing, 1. =Economy= For the most part, the Malaitans survive by subsistence agriculture, with taro and sweet potatoes as the most important crops. After the establishment of government control, a plantation was established on the west coast, near Baunani. However, many Malaitans work on plantations on other islands in the archipelago, for most the only way to buy prestigious Western goods. Retail trade was largely conducted by Chinese merchants, with headquarters in Honiara, and dispatching goods to remote locations on the island, where they are sometimes purchased by middlemen who keep \\"stores\\" (usually of suitcase side) in remote places. =Arts= The Malaitans are famous for their music and dance, which are sometimes associated with rituals. Several of the groups, including the 'Are'are, famous for their panpipe ensembles, are among SSEC members whose traditional music is no longer performed for religious reasons.Zemp, Hugo. Liner notes to Solomon Islands: 'Are'are Panpipe Ensembles. Le Chant du Monde LDX 274961.62, 1994. Page 58-59. Secular dancing is similar to widespread patterns in the Solomons, following patterns learned from plantation labor gangs or moves learned at the cinema in Honiara. Sacred dances follow strict formal patterns, and incorporate panpipers in the group.Ross, 129. Some dances represent traditional activities, such as the tue tue dance, about fishing, which depict movements of the boat and fish, and the birds overhead.Romano Kokonge, \\"The Arts,\\" in Ples Blong Iumi, 65. Malaitan shell-money, manufactured in the Langalanga lagoon, is the traditional currency, and was used throughout the Solomon Islands, as far as Bougainville. The money consists of small polished shell disks which are drilled and placed on strings. It can be used as payment for brideprice, funeral feasts and compensation, as well ordinary purposes as a cash equivalent. It is also worn as an adornment and status symbol. The standard unit, known as the tafuliae, is several strands 1.5 m in length. Previously the money was also manufactured on Makira and Guadalcanal.Romano Kokonge, 63. It is still produced on Malaita, but much is inherited, from father to son, and the old traditional strings are now rare.Kent, 44. Porpoise teeth are also used as money, often woven into belts.

It is in general a concept of point-set topology. Before giving the lemma, one notes the following terminology: * If and are topological spaces and is the product space, a slice in is a set of the form for * A tube in is just a basis element, , in containing a slice in , where is an open subset of . Using the concept of closed maps, this can be rephrased concisely as follows: if is any topological space and a compact space, then the projection map is closed.  Examples and properties  1\\\\. Consider in the product topology, that is the Euclidean plane, and the open set N = { (x, y) : x¬∑y < 1 }. The open set contains , but contains no tube, so in this case the tube lemma fails. Indeed, if is a tube containing and contained in , must be a subset of (‚àí1/x, +1/x) for all positive integers which means } contradicting the fact that is open in (because is a tube). This shows that the compactness assumption is essential. 2\\\\. The tube lemma can be used to prove that if and are compact topological spaces, then is compact as follows: Let } be an open cover of ; for each , cover the slice by finitely many elements of } (this is possible since is compact being homeomorphic to ). Call the union of these finitely many elements . By the tube lemma, there is an open set of the form containing and contained in . The collection of all for x belonging to X is an open cover of and hence has a finite subcover . Then for each , is contained in . Using the fact that each is the finite union of elements of and that the finite collection covers , the collection is a finite subcover of . 3\\\\. By example 2 and induction, one can show that the finite product of compact spaces is compact. 4\\\\. The tube lemma cannot be used to prove the Tychonoff theorem, which generalizes the above to infinite products.  Proof  The tube lemma follows from the generalized tube lemma by taking } and . It therefore suffices to prove the generalized tube lemma. By the definition of the product topology, for each there are open sets and such that . For any , } is an open cover of the compact set so this cover has a finite subcover; namely, there is a finite set such that V_{a} := \\\\bigcup_{b \\\\in B_0(a)} V_{a,b} contains , where observe that is open in .

(ICG), is a company headquartered in Teays Valley, West Virginia that was incorporated in May 2004 by WL Ross & Co for the sole purpose of acquiring certain assets of Horizon. ICG eventually operated 12 mining complexes in Northern and Central Appalachia (Kentucky, Maryland, and West Virginia) and one complex in the Illinois Basin. In November 2005 ICG had a stock offering on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2011 ICG became a subsidiary of Arch Coal, Inc in 2011. History Wilbur Ross's WL Ross & Co and other investors established the International Coal Group, Inc. (ICG) in May 2004 with the intention of purchasing distressed coal companies, then restructuring them to operate more competitively. In August 2004 Wilbur Ross's Newcoal LLC and Oldcoal LLC, in partnership with A.T. Massey Coal Company acquired the assets of the bankrupt Horizon Natural Resources, the fourth largest coal company in the United States. for $786 million. On August 9, 2004 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William Howard ruled that Ross, would \\"not have to honor union contracts that guaranteed benefits for 1,000 active miners and some 2,300 retirees.\\" The United Mine Workers of America staged a protest in response. Newcoal LLC was only interested in acquiring Horizon's nonunion properties. When the International Coal Group, Inc. acquired the assets of Horizon Natural Resources it changed its name to ICG, Inc. in September 2004. In a letter to shareholders ICG Chairman Ross, announced that ICG had agreed to acquire Anker Coal Group, Inc. and CoalQuest Development LLC with the transaction being carried out through a holding company reorganization. Through the reorganization the \\"existing International Coal Group, Inc.\\" changed its name to \\"ICG, Inc.\\" A new company called \\"International Coal Group, Inc.\\" will be the holding company for ICG, Anker and CoalQuest. Shareholders who have shares of the \\"old International Coal Group\\" created in 2004 will receive shares of International Coal Group, Inc., the new holding company created in 2005 in a \\"one-for-one tax-free exchange\\". The directors and officers of old International Coal Group will become the directors and officers of International Coal Group, Inc., the new holding company. On June 15, 2011 Arch Coal acquired International Coal Group through a merger for $3.4 billion. ICG became a wholly owned subsidiary of Arch Coal. Coal prices were rising as demand for coal from China and India were increasing. The merged company is the second-largest coking-coal producer in the United States. By 2006, W.L. Ross & Co. owned 13.7% of the ICG shares which were then valued at about $200 million. Sago Mine disaster ICG operates the mine in Sago, West Virginia where at approximately 6:30 a.m. on January 2, 2006, 13 coal miners were trapped after an explosion in the Sago Mine disaster. Twelve miners were later found to have died, while one survivor, Randal McCloy Jr., was taken to a hospital in critical condition. ICG faced controversy after an initial report claimed 12 of the trapped miners had been found alive. According to an article in the Wall Street Journal ICG gave an initial donation of $2 million to support the families of the victims. According to a January 27, 2008 article in the Pittsburgh Post, McCloy Jr. and the family of one of the victims settled lawsuits against ICG. The lawsuits \\"alleged negligence by ICG and the other companies, including alleged failure to maintain a safe working environment.\\" In 2005, the mine was cited by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) 208 times for violating regulations, up from 68 in 2004. Of those, 96 were considered significant/serious and substantial (S&S;). According to a January 4, 2006 article in the New York Times, federal records showed that their inspectors had fined the Sago mine \\"more than $24,000 for roughly 202 violations in 2005\\". Anindya Mohinta, a London-based mining analyst with J.P. Morgan, questioned Ross for investing so heavily in the coal industry \\"because of myriad government safety and environmental regulations\\" the coal industry \\"requires so much capital investment to improve bankrupt assets.\\" Mohinta said that the \\"human risks of investing in businesses like coal mines have an \\"act of God\\" component and it is risky for new companies in the sector to know where and when to spend money for maintenance and prevention.\\" In late November of early December 2005, ICG acquired Anker West Virginia Mining Company Inc who had been the official mine operator of Sago Mine. The official Sago Mine operator became Wolf Run Mining Company in late 2005. Wolf Run Mining Company was a subsidiary of Hunter Ridge Mining Company, which in turn was a subsidiary of the parent company ICG according to Vice President Sam Kitts in his testimony before the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) hearing on March 23, 2006. As of August 26, 2015 Anker West Virginia Mining Company Inc was listed as the official business name of the operator. Chuck Dunbar was the general manager and Johnny Stemple, was one of the safety managers, Ty Coleman was in the command center as a ICG representative. Kitts suggested that he thought the \\"explosion occurred as a result of a lightning strike igniting methane in the 21 sealed area.\\" He cited the March 15, 2005 ICG press release on page 14, which stated that there was a lightning strike, a detected seismic event, and the alarm of the mine CO-monitoring 3 system went off with all three events happening within the space of roughly one 5 seconds. Kitts identified Ben Hatfield as his supervisor during the period of transition from Anker to ICG. ICG was in the process of acquiring Anker in November 2005. Clean Water Act In 2012 four groups including the Waterkeeper Alliance and Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, Appalachian Voices, Kentucky Riverkeeper and three private citizens won an historic settlement in the Franklin Circuit Court with the Energy and Environment Cabinet and ICG that \\"addresses water pollution and false reporting by the International Coal Group\\". The lawsuit revealed a lack of state oversight, inaccurate water monitoring reports, and noncompliance with the Clean Water Act in the coal industry in Kentucky. In late 2010 as reports of the violations were revealed, the state of Kentucky clamped down on ICG. With accurate reporting in place, water pollution violations by ICG were revealed. The proposed settlement of $575,000 that ICG has agreed to pay includes a fine of $225,000. The settlement includes third-party auditing of ICG's water monitoring. The money \\"will be used to monitor and clean up polluted waterways in eastern Kentucky.\\" ICG will pay $335,000 to Kentucky PRIDE to use toward eliminating residential \\"straight pipes\\" dumping sewage into streams.\\" Bennett K. Hatfield Ben Hatfield was President and CEO of ICG in 2006. Hatfield had management positions at Arch Coal, Massey Energy and until his resignation in 2015, he was president and CEO of Patriot Coal. Patriot filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the month following Hatfield's resignation. He was also a member of the West Virginia Coal Association board. In May 2016 59-year-old Bennett K. Hatfield was shot and killed by twenty-year-old Anthony R. Arriaga of Gibsanburg, Ohio in what appeared to be a bungled robbery attempt.

The group consists of Marc De Pape (guitar), John-Marcel de Waal (drums), Bryce Gracey (bass guitar), Lisa Lobsinger (vocals) and Patrick Walls (guitar). They are fronted by Lobsinger, who occasionally contributes to indie band Broken Social Scene. The group originally formed in Calgary, Alberta in 2002, disbanded in 2004, but later reformed in 2005. They have established a large fan base in Canada, but have had little success outside the country. Their albums have received mostly positive reviews from critics, although their songs have been criticized for not being memorable enough. History Reverie Sound Revue formed in Calgary, Alberta, in 2002. =Reverie Sound Revue EP (2003‚Äì2004)= In 2003, Reverie Sound Revue self-released an eponymous extended play to critical acclaim, which gained fans in the local music scene. The EP also impressed indie rock performer Brendan Canning, which led to Lobsinger touring with his band Broken Social Scene. The EP sold over 2000 copies, solely through live shows and Megatunes, a Calgary music store. They toured Canada twice. They were included in the \\"Best of the Fest\\" line-up at Vancouver's New Music West festival in 2003. The group disbanded in 2004 due to band members leaving Calgary for other places in Canada. =Reverie Sound Revue (2005‚Äìpresent)= After a year, band member Marc De Pape became interested in reforming the group. He used e-mail to send instrumental tracks to the other band members, who were living in Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal, for them to play and record the other instruments. On 23 June 2009, they released the album, entitled Reverie Sound Revue, on Boompa Records after being in development for a total of seven years. It received generally positive reviews from music critics. The band also re-released their debut EP, including a bonus track. After releasing the album, they went on a \\"blog tour\\", with De Pape recording and releasing promotional live videos in which three of the band members played some of their songs online. He also made two music videos in order to promote the album. The band has no plans to go on any real tours. In 2010, band member Lisa Lobsinger explained that the band members enjoy making music together, but were too busy with other activities to do live shows together. Musical style The band has jazz and \\"moody Britpop\\" as major influences for their albums, and has been called an \\"under- appreciated band of Canadian popsmiths\\". They also have the bands Ivy, Phoenix and Saint Etienne as minor influences for their music. Lisa Lobsinger provides vocals for their releases, usually whispering. Her voice is backed by clean guitar riffs, \\"delicate\\" melodies, simple drum loops and a wall of sound. The music also features a tight rhythm section and a large amount of reverb. Their EP had the band use \\"heavy pop leanings\\" and sound synthesizers for their music. For the studio album, they abandoned that style for \\"more moody\\" music, without synthesizers. The band's sound has been described as \\"ambient\\", \\"cool and collected\\".

Cordova High School is a part of the Shelby County Schools. It is previously a Memphis City Schools district campus. Before the merger of MCS, Cordova High School served portions of Memphis as well as some portions of unincorporated Shelby County which are also zoned to elementary and middle schools in the SCS district. In 2007 Cordova High School had an expected enrollment of 2,400. History Cordova High School was constructed in 1996 and completed in 1997 as a joint venture between the Memphis City Schools and Shelby County Schools district. The school opened during the 1997-1998 school year to a class of freshmen as a school in the Shelby County Schools. The freshmen of the 1997-98 school year voted the school's colors to be green and black, and the school's mascot to be the wolf. Every following year the school added a new class until 2001, when the first graduating class left Cordova High School. In 2003 The Memphis School Board of Education debates the tax cost within the Shelby County Schools board of placing two county schools in the city school district. Therefore, Cordova High School was zoned to Memphis City Schools. Expect for Ross Elementary that was already placed in the city school system in 2003 before Cordova and Kate Bond. After the 2003-04 school year with Cordova High School, The school was leaving the Shelby County Schools district and becoming a member of the Memphis City Schools district. Cordova adopted a school uniform policy in Fall 2004, since the entire Memphis City Schools district adopted a uniform policy. All schools were required to adopt one at the time. A student petition created at the end of the 2014-2015 school year caught Principal Chandler's attention, bringing an end to the uniform policy after a vote by the parents. The uniform policy was replaced by a dress code. In 2014, Cordova High School rezoned back to Shelby County Schools.

Biography Born to a medical family in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, Zhu was admitted to Peking University at the age of 17 in 1916, majoring in philosophy. Prior to the emergence of Marxism in the 1920s, anarchism and socialism were major influences among radical students. Zhu adopted radical anarchist and oeuvrierist views, was an active student writer and editor and pioneered the use of the 'big-character poster.' Taking active part in the student protests that erupted following the Paris Peace Talks and the Treaty of Versailles, and which developed into the patriotic and anti-feudal May Fourth Movement in 1919, Zhu was arrested by Beijing's warlord government in October. In his undergraduate years at Peking University, Zhu befriended the young Mao Zedong who was then an assistant in the University library. In the interviews with Edgar Snow published in Red Star over China Mao acknowledged the influence of Zhu's anarchism. In 1921, Zhu expressed disillusion with radicalism and went to Nanjing to study with the Buddhist revivalists Taixu (1889‚Äì1947) and Ouyang Jingwu (1871‚Äì1943). Again disillusioned with the corruption among the Buddhist clergy, he wandered for a period of time before taking up a teaching position at Xiamen University in Fujian Province, resigning in 1924 to live in seclusion near West Lake in Hangzhou. In 1929, Zhu Qianzhi received a stipend from the Central Research Institute, and travelled to Japan where he studied philosophy. In 1931 he took up a post at Jinan University, then in 1932 transferred to Sun Yat-sen University where he remained as professor until his death in 1972. Zhu was a productive scholar whose output covered Chinese, Western and Japanese philosophy, the history of China's intellectual impact on the West, the history of Chinese music, and autobiography. His early writings capture the romantic revolutionism of the May Fourth era. His works in English include Chinese Philosophy and the French Revolution and The European Renaissance and Chinese Civilization (1946). Like many others of his generation, Zhu came under fire from Maoist authorities in the 1950s and was forced to write stereotyped denunciations of former associates and their ideas. His Shijieguande zhuanbian: qishi zishu [A Changing Worldview - Autobiography at 70] () was completed in 1968 but not published until 1980 when the Cultural Revolution had concluded.

The root of the word comes from beƒáar (), meaning \\"bachelor\\", \\"reveler\\" or \\"carouser\\". Beƒáarci are always teasing, mocking and/or lascivious, and are usually sung by a male company at village parties.Cvitanic, Marilyn. Culture and Customs of Croatia, Greenwood Publishing, 2011. Description Beƒáarac uses a strict form of couplet in decasyllable, always sung to the same music, played by a tamburitza orchestra or just by the choir. The first verse is sung by the choir leader and forms a logical thesis; it is repeated by the choir of gathered men. The second verse is a humorous antithesis, also repeated by the choir (but often broken by laughter). Beƒáarci are usually performed at the peak of a party as a drinking song after the crowd is sufficiently warmed up by wine and music. A series of beƒáarci can last indefinitely. The lyrics are often made up at the spot or improvised,Dubinskas, Frank. Performing Slavonian folklore, Stanford University; 1983 and the best ones are spread and reused for later parties.

He is considered the Horace of the twentieth century.  Early life  Weller's father was a businessman concerned with industrial products and a commercial traveller, and his mother was a baker's daughter from Gm√ºnd. His parents died by 1890, so the 12-year-old was an orphan along with his eight siblings but his parents‚Äô maid took care of the upbringing of the nine children.  Education  Hermann Weller transferred from the Real Lyceum in Gm√ºnd to the ‚ÄúLatin School‚Äù in Bad Mergentheim. In 1897, he passed the school leaving examination. Weller then studied law in Berlin and T√ºbingen, and then Classical Languages. In 1901 he received his doctorate in Latin and Sanskrit. In subsequent years, he completed his state examination in Latin, Greek, French and Hebrew. He also distinguished himself by a sound knowledge of English, Italian, Indian and Persian.  Working life  After his studies in T√ºbingen, the classical philologist taught as a school teacher in the Ellwangen Gymnasium between 1913 and 1931. He also held a position at the Ehingen Gymnasium. In 1930 he qualified as a university teacher in T√ºbingen. Weller was already so famous by 1931 that in that year the Ellwangen town council decided to name a street after him.  The \\"Y Elegy\\"  Weller wrote the elegy in neo-Latin Y Elegy, which describes how in a poet's dream the letters of the alphabet from a volume of Horace's poetry become alive, and how A calls in a demagogic speech for the extermination of the foreign letter Y. Y escapes and tries through words (myths, mysticism, rhythm, and physics) to prove its right to exist, but the other letters do not allow themselves to be convinced, and are in the process of excluding Y. The poet asks for release and awakes from this nightmare. Weller, a private senior lecturer, at T√ºbingen University, submitted the Y Elegy at the end of 1937, to the Certamen Hoeufftianum, a competition of neo-Latin poetry of the Royal Dutch Academy of Wetenschappen (KNAW) held annually in Amsterdam, which he won thirteen times in the course of his life. In 1938 Weller was awarded the Gold Medal for this text. The fact that Weller could be promoted to the position of Special Professor in the same year (despite certain doubts on account of his Catholicism) shows that knowledge of Latin among Nazi officials was not wide. The Latin scholar, Uwe Dubielzig, recognised in 2001 that the text was a playfully disguised accusation against the ever more apparent anti-Semitism of the Nazis, the effects of which Weller could observe in his immediate surroundings of T√ºbingen University. Additionally, if the text cannot be read as a document of anti-fascist resistance, it is still a spirited but camouflaged document opposing the Nazi racist politics, the full brutality of which, before the pogrom of the so-called Reichskristallnacht, Weller would have underestimated, (as did Charlie Chaplin even in 1940 in his film The Great Dictator). In that sense the Y Elegy can be assessed as a remarkable testimony for 'internal emigration'.  References   Additional sources  * lat.

Early life MacGregor was born in Kinlochleven, Scotland.

InfoTrac Full Text Newspaper Database. Gale. Cheshire Libraries. 16 September 2007 He attended George Watson's College, Edinburgh and Hillhead High School, Glasgow. At the University of Glasgow, MacGregor studied metallurgy and engineering with some distinction, receiving a first-class degree. He then earned a diploma with distinction at the Royal College of Science and Technology.Kirby (2006) MacGregor started work as a metallurgist in 1935, alongside his father in the Kinlochleven aluminium plant but he was soon recruited as a junior manager at William Beardmore and Company's Parkhead Forge to work on vehicle armour. There, he faced an early confrontation with trade union leader David Kirkwood in a strike involving crane-drivers. MacGregor's handling of the matter, involving driving cranes himself for two weeks, brought him to the attention of chairman Sir James Lithgow, who marked him out for rapid promotion.\\"Sir Ian MacGregor; Obituary\\" The Times (London, England) (14 April 1998): 21. InfoTrac Full Text Newspaper Database. Gale. Cheshire Libraries. 16 September 2007 At the start of World War II in 1939, MacGregor went to work for the Ministry of Supply on the development of tanks. Minister of Aircraft Production Lord Beaverbrook was the next to spot his talent and commandeered him to travel to Canada and the US on procurement missions for aviation amour. He was then seconded to the British military mission in the US where he started to become familiar with US industry, including work on the development of the Sherman tank. Postwar At the end of the war in 1945, MacGregor remained in the US, attracted to its culture and disdainful of the newly elected British Labour government with its programme of nationalisation. In later life he observed: He was soon to be disabused of the purported classlessness of US society when a proposed takeover of a Connecticut firm fomented strike action. MacGregor was reputedly threatened by the Mafia and had his car overturned by pickets while he was inside. His takeover went ahead. He became chief executive of American Metal Climax in 1966, diversifying the company into mining. He developed a reputation for shrewd, no-nonsense negotiation in various strands of American business, and an uncompromising attitude towards trade unions accompanied by something of an appetite for confrontation. His method was to \\"always get your ducks lined up,\\" and he often referred to his \\"Department of Economic Warfare\\". During the British miners' strike he nostalgically observed: In later life he explained: He went on to become a director of Lazard and chairman of the International Chamber of Commerce. Repatriation During his chairmanship at American Metal Climax, MacGregor maintained his contacts and visibility with trans- Atlantic \\"straddle projects\\". For example, in 1971‚Äì72, he helped spearhead a high-level US-EC Businessmen's Conference at Versailles assembling top industrialists. MacGregor served on the Steering Committee, and delivered a speech which reassured Europeans on American commitment for trade expansion during heightened concerns following the Nixon Administration's decoupling of the dollar's linkage with gold and the threat of Labor-backed legislation (Burke-Hartke Bill) with protectionist quotas and investment curbs. =British Leyland= He was brought back to British industry by Labour Party prime minister James Callaghan in 1977 as a non-executive director of the ailing nationalised car manufacturer British Leyland. The intention was that he would act as deputy to chairman Sir Michael Edwardes but MacGregor was not content to operate in a purely strategic role and always maintained that it was he, and not Edwardes, who had taken the pivotal step of dismissing Derek Robinson. Other accounts differ. =British Steel= In 1979, the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher came to power and embarked, at first tentatively, on the radical programme of industrial restructuring that would come to be known as Thatcherism. Secretary of State for Industry Sir Keith Joseph recognised MacGregor as an instinctive supporter and potential implementer of the programme. Joseph appointed MacGregor chairman of the nationalised British Steel Corporation in 1980, the British government paying Lazard's a ¬£1.8 million settlement. Such a use of government funds, coupled with MacGregor's lack of reputation in Britain led to an outcry in the House of Commons. His tenure at British Steel was controversial. On his appointment, British Steel employed 166,000 staff and produced 14 million tons of steel annually at a loss of ¬£1.8 billion. MacGregor was remorseless in his programme of plant closures and redundancies. A few of the redundancies were voluntary but were made against a background of mounting unemployment in the UK and damaged many traditional steel-working communities. By 1983, there were only 71,000 staff with losses stemmed to ¬£256 million. The company was now moving towards profitability and would be in the vanguard of the Thatcher government's programme of privatisation. =National Coal Board= His next role was as head of the National Coal Board (NCB), approved in person by Thatcher. The appointment, announced on 28 March 1983, was greeted with considerable disdain by the National Union of Mineworkers, in particular its president Arthur Scargill. Scargill was concerned at MacGregor's uncompromising business methods, branding MacGregor \\"the American butcher of British industry.\\" MacGregor replied that he was \\"a plastic surgeon\\" whose job was to \\"try to rebuild damaged features.\\" He provoked Yorkshire miners by telling them that they were less productive than women miners in the US. MacGregor's approach to turning the NCB into a profitable concern was similar to the line he had taken at British Steel: cut jobs and close unprofitable pits. This led to the protracted and increasingly bitter 1984‚Äì1985 miner's strike. Despite many meetings between the two opposing sides no agreement was ever reached, and the UK coal industry continued its decline when the strike finished. Only 15 deep mines remained at the time of privatisation in 1994, although some briefly reopened; fewer than 10% of the figure 10 years earlier, when 170 collieries had still been operational. , there were three deep coal mines operating in the UK; by the end of 2015 they had all gone with the closure of Kellingley, the UK's last deep colliery. Later life MacGregor retired from the NCB in 1986, rejoining Lazard's as a non-executive director. In the UK, there were campaigns to appoint him as head of the National Health Service and to the board of directors of British Gas plc but without success. He enjoyed a variety of company chairmanships including Goldcrest Films but was disappointed to be forcibly retired from two US companies when he reached 78. He maintained his British business interests, observing \\"Being British is a faith. I will never lose it.\\" Personality and private life He married Sybil Spencer (died 1996) in Washington, D.C. in 1942; she was from Wales. They had a son and a daughter. MacGregor split his time between his homes in New York, Bermuda and Loch Fyne. MacGregor was chairman of Religion in American Life and, in the UK, the Organization for Rehabilitation through Training. He was an active campaigner against ageism in employment. Outside the boardroom, some found him \\"a benign and rather avuncular man, whose Scottish burr was distinctly audible beneath the overlay of his American accent.\\" Others saw him as \\"affable and stimulating: with his tongue partly in his cheek\\" and as \\"emotional and often unpredictable. He thought of himself as a creator; he returned to the UK out of a sense of patriotism as much Scots as British; and the large fees he earned were less for consumption ‚Äì certainly not of any conspicuous kind ‚Äì as to sustain his ceaseless world travels.\\" Scottish miners' leader Mick McGahey described him as \\"viciously anti-trade union and anti-working class\\", claiming that he had worked \\"to destroy trade unionism not only in mining, but in Britain.\\" Margaret Thatcher herself felt that he had handled the public relations aspect of the miners' dispute poorly, failing to empathise with the British public's widespread sympathy for the miners and their communities, and the pair were on cool terms after his departure from the NCB. Ian MacGregor was inducted into the Junior Achievement US Business Hall of Fame in 1979. Death MacGregor died of a heart attack, at Taunton, Somerset and was cremated. On his death, many involved in the 1984-5 strike expressed great bitterness against him. NUM vice-president at the time, Mick McGahey said, \\"It's no loss to people of my ilk. MacGregor was a vicious anti-trades unionist, anti-working class person, recruited by the Tory government quite deliberately for the purpose of destroying trade unionism in the mining industry. I will not suffer any grief, not will I in any way cry over the loss of Ian MacGregor.\\" However, others saw him as a positive force. Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said: \\"He brought a breath of fresh air to British industry and he had such a genial personality. He had a tremendous way of putting things. He made a real difference and I was very grateful when he came back to this country.\\" Honours *John Fritz Medal, (1981); *Bessemer Gold Medal, (1983) https://www.iom3.org/awards- archive *Knighthood, (1986); *Chevalier of the L√©gion d'honneur, (1972).

It opened in 1880 and operated until 1976. Construction Hatfield ford bridge abutments In 1877, the District Railways Act was passed to enable districts to construct railway lines whose construction would not be financed by the government, and in May 1878, the Rakaia and Ashburton Forks Railway Company Ltd was established to construct a line inland from the Main South Line in Rakaia to the township of Methven. The first sod was turned on 19 November 1878 in Rakaia, and as the railway did not have to pass through any difficult terrain, it was built swiftly and the full 35.6 kilometre line was opened on 26 February 1880. Originally, the line was planned to connect to Mount Somers however this did not eventuate. Settlers began petitioning the government to acquire the line in 1884, and negotiations resulted in the line being incorporated into the national network in April 1885, though formal permission from the shareholders did not come until May. Operation Lyndhurst Goods shed The Rakaia and Ashburton Forks Railway Company possessed two 2-4-4T tank locomotives built by Rogers Locomotive Works and they were used to operate trains from the opening of the line. As of 13 December 1880, the government operated the Methven Branch, but the company provided the motive power and rolling stock. After the full acquisition of the line by the government in 1885, it was operated much like other rural branch lines in New Zealand, with a crew in Methven operating a daily \\"mixed\\" train of both passengers and freight to the main line junction and return. The branch's main traffic was associated with agriculture, with the main inbound freight being fertiliser and outbound being livestock, and the busiest period for goods cartage came in the 1940s when 37,000 tonnes was carried annually. Passenger numbers, however, hit their peak in the 1920s, and subsequently declined until the passenger service was cancelled on 7 September 1958. Methven was naturally aligned to Christchurch and its port in Lyttelton rather than a regional centre such as Ashburton, and trains began operating from Christchurch rather than Methven not long before the conclusion of World War II. AB class steam locomotives were the typical form of motive power for many years on the line until it was dieselised in September 1967. Despite trains being cut to run only thrice weekly in 1969, Methven still retained a small diesel shunting locomotive in 1972. However, traffic simply was not sufficient to justify the continued existence of the line and it was closed on 31 July 1976. The branch today Lauriston goods shed Remnants of closed railway lines naturally diminish and disappear over time due to both natural and human impacts, though some relics of the Methven Branch can still be found. As recently as the late 1990s the station sign in Rakaia still stated \\"Rakaia: change here for Methven Branch\\" - despite the fact passenger services on the branch had concluded roughly four decades previously. At the south end of the yard, where the branch left the main line, some rails remained in place. The line required little in the way of significant earthworks, but the formation closely followed a road known as Thompson Track out of Rakaia and can still be traced; some rails remain embedded in the road surface where Jamieson's Road meets Thompson Track. Some bridge abutments can also be sighted, and goods sheds remain in Lauriston and Lyndhurst. In the latter locale, loading platforms built to serve sidings from the railway can still be seen at two businesses. Only one railway building now remains in Methven, though the embankment the railway used as it approached the town is still apparent. The 'Railway Reserve' in the centre of Methven is a small park adjacent to the Blue Pub and Medical Centre and was the site of the railway station.

While a teenager, he was arrested, imprisoned, and beaten severely for publishing leaflets against the Ba'ath Party. After six years in prison, he was freed in a political amnesty and was allowed to return to school; he completed a BA degree in English at Al-Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. He graduated in June 1976 and left Iraq on a tourist visa; his mother paid a substantial fine, equivalent to approximately a year's income, when he did not return. Simawe made his way via Paris to North Africa, where he taught Arabic and English in high schools in Libya until 1980. He has made several return trips to North Africa to teach, write and do research. Simawe obtained a student visa to the USA in 1980 and traveled from Tripoli, Libya to Lincoln, Nebraska, where he enrolled as a graduate student at the University of Nebraska. He received an MA in English from the University of Nebraska in 1983. The following fall he enrolled at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. Simawe first completed an MA in African-American Literature, before going on to a PhD in English, which he completed in 1994. Darwin Turner (1932‚Äì1991), the well-respected scholar of African American Studies, was Simawe's thesis advisor. He joined the faculty of Grinnell College in 1992, where he was an associate professor of English, teaching courses in African-American and Arabic literature. Simawe took a leave from teaching effective fall 2007 due to illness. He continues his writing and translation work and hopes to return to teaching. As is frequently the case with Iraqi intellectuals of the most recent generation, he has been unable to return to Iraq since he first left in 1976, but for a brief two-week trip into the northern Kurdish zone after the fall of Saddam Hussein. The travelers, sponsored by the Writers Union of Iraq, represented all of the ethnic entities of Iraq. Simawe died on February 19, 2017 in Coralville, Iowa, from complications with Parkinson's disease.

Huan Yi, Yang Duan, and Wang Jian commanded the relief campaign against Zhao and took its towns Ye (today's Linzhang, Hebei) and Anyang (Hebei), as well as Eyu (Heshun, Shanxi), and Liaoyang (Zuoquan, Shanxi). In 234, Huan Yi attacked Pingyang (Linfen, Shanxi) and Wucheng (Cixian, Hebei), killed general Hu Zhe and massacred 100,000 troops of Zhao. He then left Shangdang, passed the Taihang Ridge and invaded Zhao by taking Chili and Yi'an (Gaocheng, Hebei). Zhao thereupon laid the supreme command in the hands of Li Mu, who defeated Huan Yi in the battle of Fei (Jinxian, Hebei) and pushed him back out of Zhao. Huan Yi's way back was cut off, and he had to flee to Yan in the northeast. It was the last great victory of Zhao over Qin. In popular culture In Manga Kingdom, he is portrayed as Kan Ki, Qin general.

Its regarded as one of the greatest tribute to mother's love in Marathi literature. Story Shyamchi Aai is an autobiography of Sane Guruji belonging to a Brahmin family in Konkan region of rural Maharashtra during British Raj. Sane Guruji (now an adult), fondly called Shyam during his childhood, is narrating his memories to a group of children in a nightly sitting. Chapters in the book are named ratra meaning \\"night\\" in Marathi. They are named first night, second night and so on. Every passing 5, the story takes you into the family setting in rural Konkan and its beautiful seaside landscapes with adjoining ranges of Sahyadri. This book is representation of the love of mother for her child. As the title suggests the central character is Shyam's mother and the kind of enormous influence she has on Shyam's life and upbringing. It involves sticking to one's ideals even though one is neck deep in abject poverty. The narration is flamboyant and involves readers in the setting smoothly. As the story progresses, we come to know the deterioration of Shyam's debt-ridden family. The communication between father and son, mother and son, and siblings is exemplary. It shows that if love is present in a person's life, the person can be content; no matter how poor he is. The book starts with Shyam's mother getting married into a wealthy family, its slow progression into debt-ridden poverty, and ends with illness and death of his mother. In popular culture The story was adopted into a film with same title. The film was directed and produced by Actor himself. It won President's Medal as Best Feature Film at the 1st National Film Awards ceremony. The story is also adapted for stage dramas in Marathi. In 2012, the play was for the first time translated to English and performed at Kashinath Ghanekar auditorium in Thane.

Definition of mainstreaming, accessed October 11, 2007. Archived 2009-11-01. To clarify, this means students who are a part of the special education classroom will join the regular education classroom at certain times which are fitting for the special education student. These students may attend art or physical education in the regular education classrooms. Sometimes these students will attend math and science in a separate classroom, but attend English in a general education classroom. Schools that practice mainstreaming believe that students with special needs who cannot function in a general education classroom to a certain extent belong in the special education environment. Mainstreaming: \\"Special needs students \\"belong\\" in the special classroom\\", accessed October 16, 2007 Access to a special education classroom, often called a \\"separate classroom or resource room\\", is valuable to the student with a disability. Students have the ability to work one-to-one with special education teachers, addressing any need for remediation during the school day. Many researchers, educators and parents have advocated the importance of these classrooms amongst political environments that favor their elimination.The Effectiveness of Resource Programming Sindelar and Deno J Spec Educ.1978; 12: 17-28 Oftentimes mainstreamed students will have certain supports they will bring to the general education classroom. A common support is to bring a one- on-one aide to assist them. Other equipment may be tools from their special education classroom that assist them in keeping up with the demands of the general education classroom. This may be a device that helps a deaf student communicate with their peers, a special chair for a student diagnosed with A.D.H.D., or a special desk for a student that is in a wheelchair. Some of these students may need accommodations on assignments or tests. Proponents of both the philosophy of educational inclusion assert that educating children with disabilities alongside their non-disabled peers fosters understanding and tolerance, better preparing students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school.IDEA Funding Coalition, \\"IDEA Funding: Time for a New Approach,\\" Mandatory Funding Proposal, Feb. 20 2001, p. 2. Children with special needs may face social stigma as a result of being mainstreamed, but also may help them socially develop. There is often a lot of confusion between the terms mainstreaming and inclusion. Often these terms are used interchangeably, but they mean two very different things. Mainstreamed students are part of the special education classroom. When they enter the regular education classroom for certain subjects, this is considered mainstreaming. In comparison, inclusion students are regular education classroom students who receive special education services. Usually whether is not a student's education is mainstreamed or inclusion is based on which is the least restrictive environment, which can be determined in the students IEP. Dr. Kenneth Shore comments on the least restrictive environment by claiming, ‚ÄúDetermining what is the least restrictive environment for a particular student requires balancing the need for the child to learn to integrate socially with his non- disabled peers with the need for the child to receive instruction appropriate to his abilities.‚Äù Advantages =Benefits to students with disabilities= *Higher academic achievement: Mainstreaming has shown to be more academically effective than exclusion practices.Special Education Inclusion For instance, The National Research Center on Learning Disabilities found that graduation rates of all students with disabilities in the U.S. increased by 14% from 1984 to 1997, although this report does not differentiate between students enrolled in mainstreaming, inclusive, or segregated programs.(2006). Mainstreaming Deaf Students. Independent School, 66, 6. Retrieved November 29, 2007, from EBSCOhost database. Access to a resource room for direct instruction has shown to be effective in increasing students academic skills and thus increasing the abilities applied by students in a general education setting. Compared to full-time placement in a special education class or special school, both part- time and full-time placement in the regular classroom have been shown to improve academic achievement in students with mild academic disabilities, as well as to improve their long-term behavior.NA Madden, RE Slavin (1983). Review of Educational Research, Vol. 53, No. 4, 519-569 *Higher self-esteem: By being included in a regular-paced education setting, students with disabilities have shown to be more confident and display qualities of raised self-efficacy. All students in California who went to a different school prior to attending a mainstreaming program were asked to fill out an assessment of their old school as compared to inclusion program. The assessments showed that out of all students with disabilities 96% felt they were more confident, 3% thought they had the same experience as an excluded student, and 1% felt they had less self-esteem. Overall, students felt that they were equal to their peers and felt that they should not be treated any differently.(2007). Twenty- five years of progress in educating children with disabilities through IDEA. National Research Center on Learning Disabilities. Retrieved November 29, 2007, from http://www.nrcld.org/resources/osep/historyidea.html *Better social skills: Any kind of inclusion practice, including mainstreaming, allows students with disabilities to learn social skills through observation, gain a better understanding of the world around them, and become a part of the \\"regular\\" community. Mainstreaming is particularly beneficial for children with autism and ADHD. By interacting with same-aged non-disabled children, children with autism were observed to be six times more likely to engage in social relations outside of the classroom. Because children with autism spectrum disorders have severely restricted interests and abnormalities in communication and social interaction, the increased interaction with typical children may be beneficial to them. The same 1999 study showed that students with Down syndrome were three times more likely to communicate with other people. Mainstreaming also benefits other children. It opens the lines of communication between those students with disabilities and their peers. If they are included into classroom activities, all students become more sensitive to the fact that these students may need extra assistance. =Benefits to non-disabled students= There is research that suggests that educating non-disabled students and students with disabilities together creates an atmosphere of understanding and tolerance that better prepares students of all abilities to function in the world beyond school. Students without disabilities who engaged in an inclusive physical education program reported increases in self-concept, tolerance, self-worth, and a better understanding of other people. The students also reported that the inclusion program was important because it prepared them to deal with disability in their own lives. Positive aspects that come from inclusion are often attributed to contact theory. Contact theory asserts that frequent, meaningful, and pleasant interactions between people with differences tend to produce changes in attitude. Disadvantages Although mainstreaming in education has been shown to provide benefits, there are also disadvantages to the system. =Tradeoff with non-disabled students' academic education= One potentially serious disadvantage to mainstreaming is that a mainstreamed student may require much more attention from the teacher than non-disabled students in a general class. Time and attention may thus be taken away from the rest of the class to meet the needs of a single student with special needs. The effect that a mainstreamed student has on the whole class depends strongly on the particular disabilities in question and the resources available for support. In many cases, this problem can be mitigated by placing an aide in the classroom to assist the student with special needs, although this raises the costs associated with educating this child.Manzitti, Edward T.; The added cost of an aide in a classroom to meet needs of special education students can be offset by not funding a teacher in a wholly separate classroom when mainstreaming does not occur. Teachers are encouraged to teach the entire class differently. This includes being less abstract and more concrete in content, changing lighting, simplifying the design of the classroom, and having a predictable structure and routine rather than novelty. =Harm to academic education of students with disabilities= Some research has suggested teachers who are not aware of‚Äîand later may choose not to adopt‚Äîmodifications needed for students with special needs are also more resistant to having these students in class.Joyce, B.,& Weil, M. (1986). Models of Teaching (3rd ed.) Boston: Allyn & Bacon. This can lead to regression of the students with disabilities as well as overall decreased classroom productivity. = Teacher‚Äìstudent interactions = It has been seen that general educators provide 98.7% of their teaching time doing whole class interactions. Students with disabilities have been known to require a significant more amount of individual attention with the classroom teacher. Children with disabilities spend twice as much time in whole-class activities as in one-to-one activities due to the amount of whole-class teaching, yet these students are half as likely to engage in whole-class learning activities such as writing, reading and participating, showing that whole group activities do not meet the needs of students with disabilities as much as individual work would. It is reported that mainstreamed students receive a larger proportion of the classroom teachers‚Äô total time than regular education students. However this did not result in an increase in academic instructional time. Mainstreamed students in low-ability classes receive more nonacademic correction from the classroom teacher compared to mainstreamed students in average and above-average classes or regular education students.Brady, M. P., & And Others. (1988). Teacher-Student Interactions in Middle School Mainstreamed Classes: Differences With Special and Regular Education Students. Journal of Educational Research, 81(6), 332‚Äì40.

Therefore, mainstreamed students will spend time in a resource room where they can receive more individualized attention from teachers. In contrast, there has been an increase of the number of teaching assistants(TAs) in mainstream primary settings to assist the learning and inclusion of students with SEN. Interactions with TAs has become an integral part of educational experience for students with SEN, resulting in TA interactions comprising up to a fifth of all observations students with SEN experience. Observations show that the higher the level of student SEN, the more likely it is that the student will interact more with a TA than their classroom teacher. A survey conducted in the UK (2000), composed of 300 teachers found that two-thirds of students with SEN were regularly working with TAs for an average of 3.7 hours per week. Therefore, the use of TAs to support students with SEN has become an established part of academics in a mainstream setting, and interactions with TAs comprise a key part of their day-to-day classroom experience. The survey concluded that TAs were used as alternative to teacher support, which has shown to result in unintended and troubling consequences for students with SEN. It is suggested that the inclusion of TAs in the mainstream classroom to support students with SEN has resulted in the educational experience of these students diverging from the non-SEN student, which then raises concerns about how schools choose to provide support for students with SEN.Webster, R. (2015). The Classroom Experiences of Pupils with Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Primary Schools--1976 to 2012. What Do Data from Systematic Observation Studies Reveal about Pupils‚Äô Educational Experiences over Time? British Educational Research Journal, 41(6), 992‚Äì1009. Retrieved from http://ezproxy.uis.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=eric&AN;=EJ1087733&site;=ehost- live =Social issues= Compared to fully included students with disabilities, those who are mainstreamed for only certain classes or certain times may feel conspicuous or socially rejected by their classmates. They may become targets for bullying. Mainstreamed students may feel embarrassed by the additional services they receive in a regular classroom, such as an aide to help with written work or to help the student manage behaviors. Some students with disabilities may feel more comfortable in an environment where most students are working at the same level or with the same supports. In the United States, students with autistic spectrum disorders are more frequently the target of bullying than non-autistic students, especially when their educational program brings them into regular contact with non-autistic students. Also, special-needs students can easily get lost in a regular education classroom. In some cases they may be disruptive and may compromise the learning environment of other students. As seen above, there are many social issues; however, a buddy system has been shown to improve these issues. Through having a buddy system an upper school student will be paired with a younger child with a disability. By doing this the younger student is provided with a positive relationship with a fellow student. The buddy system aims to have the younger student learn the benefits of having and sustaining a positive and supportive friendship. Social issues are improved due to the upper school student helping to alter the social experiences of the younger child through this formed friendship. = Costs = Schools are required to provide special education services but may not be given additional financial resources. A 2005 study conducted by the Special Education Expenditures Program (SEEP) showed that the cost of educating a special-needs student is between $10,558 and $20,000. In comparison, educating a student who does not need special education services costs $6,556. The average expenditure for educating students with special-needs is 1.6 times that of a general education student. =Special consequences for deaf students= Deafness is a low- incidence disability, which means that a deaf child will often be the only student in the classroom with hearing loss. This leads to a special set of issues in the mainstream classroom. While students with other disabilities may experience isolation and bullying by their non-disabled peers, they often share a common language. This is not the case for deaf students. Very few people in the mainstream academic setting know sign language, which means the communication barrier is large and can have negative effects on both academic achievement and social development. * Social skills are key to a child's healthy development and later success as an adult. Although many studies find good academic results for deaf children placed in a mainstream classroom, research also shows that mainstreamed deaf children experience higher degrees of isolation and psychological problems in comparison to deaf students who associate with other deaf peers. In order for friendships to form, communication is a necessity. For deaf children unable to use effective communication methods with the people around them, the difficulty in acquiring new friendships typically leads to isolation and a decrease in self-esteem. A study of preschool children showed that hearing preschoolers did not appear to adjust how they communicated with deaf children. Instead, they continued to use simple speech, which was effective with hearing, but not deaf, partners. This shows the isolation of the deaf child, and discredits the idea that the hearing and deaf child's communication skills will be enhanced by interaction with one another. In many cases, hearing children do not understand what it means when another child is deaf. This leads to frustration when a deaf child's speech is not clear or when the deaf child asks for continuous repetition. Communication strategies that are culturally acceptable to the deaf child, such as banging on a table or physically touching another person, can also cause the deaf child to be rejected by his or her peers because such behaviors are not always considered acceptable in mainstreaming hearing culture. Research has suggested that the placement of a deaf child in special schools or classes may be more desirable for deaf students than for those with other disabilities. This is primarily because of the greater social benefits for the students. * The residual knowledge that hearing children can access is often lost on deaf children. A hearing child can listen in on adult conversations, TV, radio and the news to learn things that are not specifically taught or told to them. This is not the case with the deaf child, who, in a hearing environment, can only learn what is directly communicated to them. This often leads to gaps in general knowledge, which can be both harmful to academic success and social interactions. * The effect of mainstreaming on Deaf culture is also a key issue for Deaf culture advocates. The rate of children enrolled in residential schools for the deaf is declining, as many hearing parents send their child to a mainstream school in hopes of preparing their child for life in the hearing world. In the past, Deaf schools and clubs served as the center for Deaf culture. Traditions, stories, and values developed and were fostered in these settings, but because of the low incidence of deafness, this same environment cannot be duplicated in the mainstream setting. Aside from the decreased socialization of a deaf child in a hearing school, Deaf community advocates also worry that the disappearance of residential Deaf schools will lead to a weakening of Deaf culture and of the community. Alternatives: what mainstreaming is not The alternatives to mainstreaming for special needs students are separation, inclusion, and excluding the student from school. Normally, the student's individual needs are the driving force behind selecting mainstreaming or another style of education. Mainstreaming does not involve putting a child full-time in a special school. Mainstreaming does not involve placing a child full-time in a regular classroom. A student who spends the entire day in a regular classroom with non-disabled peers is considered fully included. Most students with mild levels of disabilities such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder, or with non-cognitive disabilities such as diabetes are fully included. Mainstreaming does not involve teaching the child outside of school. A student who is taught in an institution (such as a hospital) or at home (such as while recovering from a serious illness) is excluded. Such a student may receive individual instruction or may attend small group instruction. A student who is excluded from school may or may not have been expelled from the school. History of mainstreaming in US schools Before the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (EHA) was enacted in 1975, U.S. public schools educated only 1 out of 5 children with disabilities. Approximately 200,000 children with disabilities such as deafness or mental retardation lived in state institutions that provided limited or no educational or rehabilitation services, , Retrieved June 26, 2007. and more than a million children were excluded from school. Another 3.5 million children with disabilities attended school but did not receive the educational services they needed. Many of these children were segregated in special buildings or programs that neither allowed them to interact with non-disabled students nor provided them with even basic academic skills. The EHA, later renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), required schools to provide specialized educational services to children with disabilities. The ultimate goal was to help these students live more independent lives in their communities, primarily by mandating access to the general education standards of the public school system. Initially, children with disabilities were often placed in heterogeneous \\"special education\\" classrooms, making it difficult for any of their difficulties to be addressed appropriately. In the 1980s, the mainstreaming model began to be used more often as a result of the requirement to place children in the least restrictive environment (Clearinghouse, E. 2003). Students with relatively minor disabilities were integrated into regular classrooms, while students with major disabilities remained in segregated special classrooms, with the opportunity to be among normal students for up to a few hours each day. Many parents and educators favored allowing students with disabilities to be in classrooms along with their nondisabled peers. In 1997, IDEA was modified to strengthen requirements for properly integrating students with disabilities. The IEPs must more clearly relate to the general-education curriculum, children with disabilities must be included in most state and local assessments, such as high school exit exams, and regular progress reports must be made to parents. All public schools in the U.S. are responsible for the costs of providing a Free Appropriate Public Education as required by federal law. Mainstreaming or inclusion in the regular education classrooms, with supplementary aids and services if needed, are now the preferred placement for all children. Children with disabilities may be placed in a more restricted environment only if the nature or severity of the disability makes it impossible to provide an appropriate education in the regular classroom.  Mainstreaming Context in Other Countries  = Australian context = It has been estimated that in the year of 2009 there has been 292,600 children attending school within Australia that has been diagnosed with a disability also within this year it has been seen that there had been a higher rate of participation within school activities coming from children with a disability compared to children without one. It has been shown that almost one in ten boys within schools (186,000) had been diagnosed with a disability where the level of girls within a school (106,600) diagnosed with a disability was around one in sixteen. Within mainstream schools it has been shown that primary schools had a higher number of students with disabilities with a high 9.1% where students within secondary schools where only 7.4% had a disability. Out of the 71,000 students attending school with a disability 64.7% have been known to have a severe or core-activated limitation. It has also been proven that special needs children within Australia demonstrate higher academic outcomes when in a mainstream school where they have been given opportunities to engage in higher academic levels and activities. Having children with a disability in a mainstream school has also been shown to increase in independent communication and motor skills. In Australia there has been a slight shift away from mainstream schools since 2003. Students with disability have begun to attend specials schools at an increasing rate instead of participating in mainstream programs in schools. By 2015, there was an increase of 33% of students with disability attended a special school. Students with disability attending mainstream schools had decreased by 22% in the same time frame. This change in school attendance is likely a reflection of experiences students with disability are having in each respective type of school. Students with disability could be finding special schools to have more adequate support for the severity or type of disability they have. Students with disability are still more commonly attending mainstreaming schools, despite the current shift towards special schools. This preference could be accredited to the improvement within the Australian education system when mainstreaming students regarding providing students with resources and tailored supports.Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (2017). Disability in Australia: changes over time in inclusion and participation in education. (Cat. no. DIS 69). Canberra: AIHW. = Sri Lanka Context = Access to special education for students with disabilities were introduced to Sri Lanka with the General Education Reforms of 1997. This piece of legislation includes 19 reforms that improved the development of curricula and teacher training, in addition to special education access. The changes made in Sri Lanka's education system that were created by this reform were to allow students to have wider spread access to special education using mainstreaming programs. In 2000, the majority of classes offered for students with disabilities were only accessible in special education units. During the same time period, children with disabilities who were of school age did not or were not able to access education at very high rates. Boys with disabilities accessed education at a higher rate than girls, with boys having a rate of 59.5% and only 40.5% for girls. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) was finally ratified in Sri Lanka in 2016, which was a step in the right direction regarding the importance and rights of disabled students in the classroom. Though Sri Lanka mainstreaming programs have the intention for inclusion of students with disabilities into mainstream education, the country of Sri Lanka has not yet made enough considerable progress to implement any type of effective disability rights law. This has led to a lack of framework for mainstreaming programs, as well as rights, for disabled students in this country. A major issue in Sri Lanka when attempting to implement mainstreaming education is the confusion regarding what mainstreaming is. There is a lack of clarity regarding the terminology including how terms such as inclusion and integration are used interchangeably. The issues regarding the lack of direction and understanding with mainstreaming programs stems from the newness of such programs in Sri Lanka. Teachers in Sri Lanka find that when working in mainstreaming classrooms they are underprepared to manage students with disabilities as they were not taught mainstreaming strategies when they were pre-service or in- service training. The education system in Sri Lanka is additionally lacking in teaching support in the classroom and little collaboration between teachers and special education teachers in schools. To create a productive mainstreaming environment, these factors must be addressed and corrected in order to improve on mainstreaming programs in Sri Lanka.Das, A. K, Daston- Attanayake, L., Hettiaarachi, S., Ranaweera, M., & Walisundara, D. (2018). Including All? Perceptions of Mainstream Teachers on Inclusive Education in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. International Journal of Special Education, 33(2), 427-447. = China Context = \\\\----The idea of inclusive education became the approach and primary focus in education toward the end of Mao Tse- tung‚Äôs era. This reform came with many challenges, such as non-accepting school cultures, inadequate teacher preparation, and lack of or insufficient resources. This geographic area had been subjected to so many issues dealing with the economy and socialization. The issues were due to the rapid changes that were being made within the country. The attempts that were made during this reform in education caused problems because the country was so unique with its history, politics, and culture.36 China did not have schools for individuals with disabilities until the American and European missionaries established institutions for the blind and deaf. This started in Beijing and Shandong Province in the nineteenth century. In 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was founded and had a population of over 450 million. There were only 42 special schools with around 2000 students attending. The students attending these special schools had hearing or vision impairments. Thirty-four of the schools were private and were managed by religious or charitable organizations. These facilities represented more of a residential home environment. During the 1950s education became the challenge of focus and during the next twenty-five years the specials schools increased as well as the student population attending a special school. In 1965, 266 special schools were available, and 22,850 students attended these schools. During the next ten years, which was during the Cultural Revolution, education was a standstill and only three more schools were established. At this time, these schools were restricted to those with hearing and visual impairments, but with the influence of communism, things started to change in these special schools and the idea of special education. The new focus of special education was to align it with the national educational goal and that was to nurture individuals to succeed as laborers and socialists. Medicine was taking a leap with a new perspective about remedial education and deficit compensation and focused on the rehabilitation of students‚Äô psychological and physiological deficits. With all the new changes, in 1979 China began to recognize that intellectually disabled children should attend these special schools. In 1987, a national survey was done and acknowledged that about 51 million people as well as 8.17 million school aged children had disabilities. China had expanded the ideas of what disabilities need special schooling and resulted in six categories: hearing and speech impaired, visual impairments, physical disabilities, intellectual disabilities, psychiatric disabilities, and multiple disabilities. In the later part of the 80s, Deng Xiaoping led the nation and demanded that the focus be economic development. The result of this growth of economics was more resources for education and in return, the education serves the community. Science and technology were how the education system was driven to success. The reform suggested that greater autonomy needed to be present within the schools and that implementation of compulsory education was a must for all children. Provisions for special education were a main part of the reform. The speed of placing students who had been denied in the past into schools had increased. There were so many children needing education and they found out how to get it to them effectively. Goals like equal opportunities and excellence for all was the focus post-Mao-China. In 1982, new laws mandated education and social support for those with special educational needs. In 1986, The Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China was passed by the National People's Congress. This supported the idea that states had to establish special schools or classes for those that had disabilities in hearing, vision, or intellect. This law started the foundation for special education in China. Since the 80s, China has included children with disabilities in to the general education classrooms within the districts that they reside. This idea is termed, sui ban jiu du and this simply means ‚Äúlearning in a regular classroom‚Äù. The students needing special education services are placed in general education classrooms for more reasons than one. It helped to resolve the issues of low enrollment rates of children with disabilities and the lack of special education teachers. It has become very successful and effective education approach in China. The Salamanca Statement asked that nations to investigate the idea of inclusive education and adopt it to help achieve Education for All. Inclusion was an idea that helped people envision that everyone possessed the right to learn and to participate fully in the classroom. This empowered everyone involved and embraced difference and diversity. It is about equal opportunities for effective education. It is about children having the opportunity to receive services in high-quality and age appropriate general education classrooms. It is about having support from all around and knowing that they are accepted and belong in that community. It is about reaching and meeting the needs of all learners and that is the goal of the education system in China.

It originally appeared on the 16-bit Atari ST, IBM PC and Commodore Amiga, before later being converted to the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC. The Commodore 64 version was included on the bundled cartridge of the ill-fated Commodore 64 Games System. Plot A corrupt businessman by the name of I.M. Tightwad, whom the circus owes $10,000, arrives on the scene with the intent of demolishing the circus unless it can pay up. He plans to build a set of luxury hotels on the terrain. In a fit of desperation, the ringmaster organises a display of six events to raise money for the doomed circus: diving, juggling, trapeze, knife throwing, tightrope and the human cannonball. The performance in each event is judged by five clown judges, who offer money depending on the quality of the show. The businessman has no intention of letting the circus raise the cash though, and he sends his lackey, the evil Fiendish Freddy, to sabotage the acts. Each player is represented by a circus animal (tiger, lion, bear, etc.) Premise The game was similar to many of the multi-event sports games of the time such as Epyx' California Games, Winter Games and Summer Games. However, Fiendish Freddy differed not only by its surroundings (circus events) offering a comedy element, it also offered a plot and a clear goal of winning $10,000. The six events were thus: =Diving= The player is challenged to jump off four diving boards of increasing height into containers of water of decreasing size, beginning with a huge wooden container, and ending in a glass of water. (The third target, however, is a cement block, a possible homage to the Looney Tunes cartoon Big Top Bunny, amongst other things.) Money is earned by completing all four levels, as well as performing a set series of stunts. Freddy attempts to hinder the player by blowing the diver off course with an enormous hair dryer; he appears if the diver fails to complete the stunt in time. =Juggling= The player must make their way through four juggling sessions of increasing difficulty. Each level brings more balls to juggle, but not just balls ‚Äì sometimes babies get lost in the mass and must be thrown back into their prams. Of course, Freddy throws a surprise or two into the mix, in the form of bombs, which can be thrown back at Freddy to consequently explode in his face, or missiles which must be juggled as per other objects. Dropping bombs or missiles will cause them to explode and kill the juggler. The juggler is allowed five mistakes (marked by dots changing from green to red) before the game is over. Missing five times without dying from a bomb or missile leads an off-stage performer to use a cane to grab the juggler and yank him off screen. =Trapeze= The aim of this section is to proceed from right to left over three levels, jumping from rope to rope. Along the way there are rings of fire and moving targets which have to be mastered. Freddy, as usual, is omnipresent with a jet pack and large pair of scissors to cut your act short if you are too slow. Sights on the ground, ranging from a marching band and organ to a trainer with his elephant, are also present as a possible distraction, although it can also be argued that the former are providing the music for the act. =Knife throwing= The player must throw knives at balloons on a rotating wheel with a female assistant strapped to it. The assistant is not a target, and will scream if hit, as well as the screen getting covered in blood. There are a limited number of knives available. If the player does not manage to burst all of the balloons before the time or knives run out, it's over. Freddy contributes to the challenge once in a while by throwing smoke grenades in to hinder the player's vision. =Tightrope= The player must walk across three tightropes armed only with a pole to keep balance. Freddy intervenes occasionally with his jet pack, attempting to knock the player off the rope, or with razor blades to cut the player in half. The blades can be deflected with the pole. =Human Cannonball= The final event involves an attempt by the player to launch him or herself into a target from a cannon. The amount of gunpowder in the cannon is predetermined, and the player has to judge the angle necessary to launch the character into the target. Freddy plays a smaller role in this subgame ‚Äì he only gets involved if the player takes too long to decide upon the angle, upon which he destroys the cannon. =Endings= There are two endings to the game. If the player collected enough money to save the circus, the performers get their revenge on Freddy by launching a portly diva with a seesaw, crushing Freddy. If the player failed to get enough money, the circus is demolished and a building labeled as Freddy Towers is erected in its place. Graphic violence The game's black humor was principally very dark and the violence was surprisingly graphic for a title of this period ‚Äì the tightrope walker gets sliced in two through the midriff when hit by a blade and the juggler is blown to pieces when hit by a bomb, for example. The lack of any kind of media panic in retrospect might seem surprising, although such public outrage only became common from about 1992 onwards, following the releases of Wolfenstein 3D and Mortal Kombat, which contained actual blood and gore. Critical reaction =ZX Spectrum= Your Sinclair awarded the game 80%, but reviewer David Wilson clearly stated that this was for the disk version ‚Äì the tape version suffered from an extremely unwieldy multi-load system. CRASH awarded it 90%. =Amiga= German Amiga magazine Amiga Joker awarded the game 81%, CU Amiga 80%, Zzap! 91%.Fiendish Freddy review, Amiga Magazine Rack =Commodore 64= Zzap! magazine awarded the game 89%, Power Play 66%.Fiendish Freddy review, Amiga Magazine Rack References External links * Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun at MobyGames Category:1990 video games Category:Amstrad CPC games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:Commodore 64 games Category:DOS games Category:Video games about clowns Category:Video games scored by Barry Leitch Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:ZX Spectrum games ","title":"Fiendish Freddy's Big Top O'Fun"},{"id":"3614763","text":"Qin Wuyang (Áß¶ËàûÈôΩ) was a young man who followed Jing Ke when the latter went on the mission to assassinate Ying Zheng, the king of Qin.

It was reassigned to the U.S. Army Middle East Force in Egypt, July 1942, becoming part of IX Fighter Command. It took part in the British Western Desert Campaign, engaged in combat during the Battle of El Alamein and, as part of Ninth Air Force, supported the Commonwealth Eighth Army's drive across Egypt and Libya, escorting bombers and flying strafing and dive-bombing missions against airfields, communications, and troop concentrations until Axis defeat in Tunisia in May 1943.

The squadron supported the British Eighth Army's landing at Termoli and subsequent operations in Italy, being reassigned to Twelfth Air Force in August 1943. It flew dive-bombing, strafing, patrol, and escort missions. In 1944, the squadron converted to P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft and flew interdiction operations in Italy. It moved to Corsica on 30 March 1944 to operate as a separate task force, and flew interdiction missions against railroads, communication targets, and motor vehicles behind enemy lines, providing a minimum of 48 fighter-bomber sorties per day. The squadron participated in the French campaign against Elba in June 1944 and in the invasion of Southern France in August. It engaged in interdiction and support operations in northern Italy from September 1944 to May 1945. The 64th flew its last combat mission on 2 May 1945. It remained in northern Italy after the end of the European War, demobilizing throughout the summer of 1945. It was reassigned to the United States in August 1945 without personnel or equipment and was inactivated at the end of August. =Cold War= Reactivated in August 1946 as part of Eleventh Air Force (Later Alaskan Air Command) as part of the air defense forces in the northwest Pacific. It provided air defense initially in the Aleutian Islands, then moved to Nome in early 1947 and to Elmendorf Air Force Base in the fall of 1947. Initially flew P-51 Mustangs, then became equipped with F-80 Shooting Star jet aircraft in 1948. Reassigned to Alaskan Air Command 10th Air Division and became a permanent part of the Alaskan Defense Forces throughout the 1950s, upgrading to the F-94 and F-89 dedicated interceptors. Was reassigned to McChord AFB, Washington in 1957, upgraded to F-102A Delta Dagger as part of the 25th Air Division, 325th Fighter Group.

Deployed temporarily to South Korea during the Pueblo crisis in January‚ÄìJune 1968. Inactivated in 1969 as part of the retirement of the F-102. = Aggressor training = Activated within th 57th Fighter Weapons Wing on 15 October 1972. Initially equipped with T-38A Talons, upgraded in April 1976 with Northrop F-5E Tiger II export fighters having been originally destined for delivery to South Vietnam and became available when the South collapsed. Since the F-5E had approximately the size and performance characteristics of a Soviet MiG-21, it was used throughout US and overseas to teach adversarial tactics and provide dissimilar air combat training to US Air Force flying units, eventually becoming the 64th Aggressor Squadron. F-5s carried no tail codes, although they did carry Nellis black/yellow check tail stripe and TAC emblem on tail. Aircraft were painted in Soviet Air Forces motif, with subdued USAF markings. The last two digits of the F-5's tail number were painted in red on front fuselage, highlighted in white. First generation aggressor F-5E 74-1572 from the 64th Aggressor Squadron, 1980 From October 1972 to June 1990, deployed throughout US and overseas to teach adversarial tactics and provide dissimilar air combat training to US Air Force flying units. Re-designated 64th Tactical Fighter Aggressor Squadron on 30 December 1981; re-designated again as 65th Aggressor Squadron on 4 January 1983. Added subdued \\"WA\\" tail code in early 1987. Transitioned to the F-16A Fighting Falcon on 1 April 1988 when the F-5Es began having structural problems with the airframes. F-16As initially borrowed from the 474th TFW at Nellis, tail coded \\"NA\\" before receiving production F-16C/Ds from General Dynamics in July 1989. F-16s were tail coded \\"WA\\", painted in a similar motif as the F-5Es with a black/yellow check tail stripe. The squadron was replaced by the 4440th Tactical Fighter Training Group, (Advisory Tactics Division) and assigned to the USAF Weapons School. The squadron was subsequently inactivated on 5 October 1990. =Modern era= F-16A Fighting Falcon's from the 64th Aggressor Squadron The squadron was reactivated on 3 October 2003, again flying the F-16 as an Aggressor Squadron. Participates in USAF Red Flag and Canadian Forces Maple Flag exercises, provides USAF Weapons School syllabus support, priority test mission support and road shows that visit various units throughout the CONUS to ACC units for training.

The company also sells Turkmenistan gas to Poland. Due to an agreement between Gazprom and Naftogaz, from 2006 till January 2009 the company supplied all of Ukraine's natural gas imports from Russia and other Central Asian countries, in addition to Turkmenistan. On October 24, 2008 Gazprom and Ukraine's national energy company Naftogaz signed a long-term cooperation deal in which was stated that Ukraine will receive Russian natural gas directly from Gazprom and Naftogaz will be the sole importer of Russian natural gas.Gazprom, Naftogaz sign long- term cooperation deal After weeks of disputes the head of Gazprom Alexei Miller and the head of Naftohaz Ukrainy Oleh Dubyna signed the 10-year agreement on natural gas supplies to Ukraine for the period of 2009-2019 on 19 January 2009. It was agreed that RosUkrEnergo will no longer supply all of Ukraine's natural gas imports from Russia and other Central Asian countries.

The report highlighted the many links in personnel between RosUkrEnergo and the previous intermediary Eural Trans Gas. According to the report, Israeli lawyer Zeev Gordon had registered Eural Trans Gas on behalf of Ukrainian businessman Dmytro Firtash. Also in late April 2006, Izvestia reported that the primary shareholder of RosUkrEnergo is Dmytro Firtash. The report stated that he owned 90% of CentraGas Holding, equaling 45% of RosUkrEnergo. The report stated that a further owner is another Ukrainian businessman Ivan Fursin, the primary shareholder of the Odessa Film Studio and an owner of Misto-bank.

He was born at Tilgate in Sussex into a family of wealthy Yorkshire industrialists, the son of James Armitage (1793‚Äì1872) and Anne Elizabeth Armitage n√©e Rhodes (1788‚Äì1833), of Farnley Hall, just south of Leeds, Yorkshire. His great-grandfather James (1730‚Äì1803) bought Farnley Hall from Sir Thomas Danby (of the family of Thomas Dany, first mayor of Leeds) in 1799, and in 1844 four Armitage brothers (including his father) founded the Farnley Ironworks, utilising the coal, iron and fireclay on their estate. His brother Edward Armitage was a member of the Royal Academy. Armitage was the uncle of Robert Armitage (MP), the great-uncle of Robert Selby Armitage, and first cousin twice removed of Edward Leathley Armitage. He was raised at Avranches in France, and at Frankfurt and Offenbach in Germany. He attended the Sorbonne and King's College London. He became a physician, practising at the Marylebone Dispensary, in the Crimean War, and as a private consultant in London. He was forced to abandon his medical career because of deteriorating vision, eventually becoming blind. Armitage decided to help make literature available to blind people through embossed type: in Britain this had become complicated by the proliferation of different standards. He formed the \\"British and Foreign Society for Improving the Embossed Literature of the Blind\\", later the \\"British and Foreign Blind Association for Promoting the Education and Employment of the Blind\\" and (after his death) the \\"National Institute for the Blind\\". This group decided to adopt the system of Louis Braille, and Armitage worked tirelessly for the adoption of Braille. In 1871 he helped to establish the Royal Normal College for the Blind (later the Royal National College for the Blind) in London. He was married to Harriett Black, and died on 23 October 1890 at Thurles, County Tipperary, Ireland, following a riding accident.

He is notable as one of the few public figures to use and promote the singing style and dialect of pre-war Warsaw after their near extinction in the aftermath of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising.  Life  Stanis≈Çaw Grzesiuk was born May 6, 1918 in Ma≈Çk√≥w near Che≈Çm. Early in his life his family moved to Warsaw's borough of Czerniak√≥w, a distinct cultural area populated mostly by factory workers and other working poor. After graduating from a local trade school he started work as an electro-technician for various enterprises. Registration card of Stanis≈Çaw Grzesiuk as a prisoner at Dachau Nazi Concentration Camp Registration card at Mauthausen/Gusen After the outbreak of World War II he was arrested by the Germans in 1940 and sent to Germany as a slave worker. However, on April 4 of that year he was sent to Dachau concentration camp following an attempted escape. He was later transferred to Gusen I (Mauthausen) and would spend almost five years there until the camp's liberation by the American army. Liberated on May 5, 1945, he returned to Poland. Although he survived the Holocaust, his health never recovered and Grzesiuk suffered from serious tuberculosis, which eventually killed him. After the war, Grzesiuk started documenting his pre-war and wartime experiences. In 1958 he debuted with Piƒôƒá lat kacetu (Five Years in Concentration Camps), a striking description of his stay in Nazi Germany during the war. The following year he published Boso, ale w ostrogach (Barefoot but with spurs), a description of the pre-war life of Czerniak√≥w, one of the most colorful boroughs of Warsaw. After its publication he became known as the chronicler of life of pre-war Warsaw in numerous songs, including the street ballads for which he became best known. Grzesiuk gained wide popularity as a singer during this period and played a prominent role in various Warsaw traditional-song groups, as a songwriter, singer and banjo player. In the 1960s he started his work on yet another novel, Na marginesie ≈ºycia (On the Margin of Life), documenting his struggle against tuberculosis, as well as the Polish post-war welfare services. Stanis≈Çaw Grzesiuk died January 21, 1963 in Warsaw. His last book was published posthumously the following year.

It is part of the company's Pac-Man series, is the third to have been produced in-house. Players control Pac-Man as he must eat the items in an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts that pursue him. Pac-Man is assisted by a green- colored creature named Miru, the titular \\"Pal\\", who brings the items back to the center box. Pac-Man can also collect power-ups that allow him to briefly stun the ghosts. Pac & Pal is largely based on Super Pac-Man, Namco's attempt at making a follow-up to the original Pac-Man. When Super Pac-Man proved to be unsuccessful, Pac & Pal was created to refine many of its mechanics and build on its concept. The game was intended to be released in North America by Midway Games under the name Pac-Man & Chomp Chomp, which replaced Miru with Pac-Man's dog from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. Chomp Chomp was never released in America, and was limited to a run of 300 machines produced for several European countries. Pac & Pal was a commercial failure and remained obscure for many years. Retrospectively, it has received attention for its premise and differences compared to its predecessors, and has been listed among the strangest games in the Pac-Man franchise. It is included in several Namco compilations for various platforms. Gameplay In-game screenshot, showing Pac-Man flipping over cards and collecting items locked within the maze. The game controls consist of a four-position joystick and a button. Using the joystick, the player guides Pac-Man through an enclosed maze in which several items are locked behind doors. Several face-down cards are scattered throughout the maze; when Pac-Man runs over one of these, it flips over to reveal one of the items, which becomes unlocked so Pac-Man can eat it. Two items in each maze are power-ups, which correspond to \\"S\\" cards. Upon eating one of these, Pac-Man temporarily turns blue and grows larger; the player can now press the button to fire a beam that briefly stuns the ghosts. Items include a flagship from Galaxian, a red car from Rally-X, a trumpet, a snowman, and a miniature Pac-Man. The items are simply different cosmetically, and all of them have the same effect. Assisting Pac-Man is the titular \\"Pal\\" character Miru, a green-colored creature with a pink bow. Whenever any items are unlocked, Miru will try to pick one up and carry it toward the center box; if Pac-Man does not catch up to her and eat the item before she enters the box, it disappears. Once all the items are gone, the level ends and the player earns bonus points for each item eaten, receiving a larger bonus for preventing Miru from taking any of them into the box. An orange area immediately below the center box causes the ghosts to slow down whenever they are inside and obscures both them and Pac-Man, leaving only the ghosts' eyes visible. The third level and every fourth level thereafter is a bonus stage with 10 cards and no ghosts; one card shows Miru, one shows the ghost Blinky, and the other eight have dollar signs. Points are awarded for each card flipped, and Miru's card doubles the total. The stage ends immediately if Blinky is found, but the player earns a larger bonus for finding him last. The player loses one life whenever Pac-Man touches a non-stunned ghost, but can safely run through Miru at any time. When all lives are lost, the game ends. Development and release Pac & Pal was developed and published by Namco in July 1983 in Japan. It is the third game in the Pac-Man series that was made by Namco themselves, as Pac-Mans North American distributor Midway Games had produced many of their own sequels that Namco had little involvement with. Pac & Pal is largely based on Super Pac-Man, Namco's own sequel to the original, and retains a similar graphical style and many of its mechanics. With the Pac- Man brand increasing in popularity in Japan, Namco sought to produce a follow- up that matched its success. Super Pac-Man was largely unsuccessful, so Pac & Pal was made to improve on its flaws and update its core features. Yuriko Keino, who is best known for her work on games such as Dig Dug and Xevious, composed the soundtrack. Namco and Midway had plans to release Pac & Pal in North America under the new name Pac-Man & Chomp Chomp, which replaced Miru with Pac-Man's spherical dog from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon series. Pac-Man & Chomp Chomp was never released in North America due to the market being over- saturated with Pac-Man games. A limited run of 300 arcade units was produced for several European countries. Pac & Pal never saw a home release until 1998, where it was included in the Japan-exclusive arcade collection Namco History Vol. 3 for Windows 95. Toy manufacturer Jakks Pacific included the game in many of their Pac-Man-branded \\"plug'n play\\" controllers throughout the mid-2000's. Pac & Pal is also included in a few Namco compilations such as Namco Museum Remix (2007), Namco Museum Virtual Arcade (2008), and Namco Museum Megamix (2010). To commemorate the launch of the Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures television series, Bandai added Pac & Pal to their Pac-Man Connect & Play controller in 2013. Pac & Pal is included in Pac-Man Museum (2014), alongside several other games in the series. In 2019, Arcade1UP released a Pac-Man \\"counter-cade\\" arcade machine that includes the original Pac-Man and Pac & Pal. Reception While Pac & Pal saw success in its first few months on the market, it was relatively a commercial failure and remained obscure for many years. The game's drastic differences compared to the original Pac-Man and Super Pac-Man and its limited production run have been attributed to its downfall. Retrospectively, Pac & Pal has gained attention for its many changes to the gameplay of its predecessors, and is seen among the stranger entries in the Pac-Man franchise. In 1998, Anthony Baize of Allgame was largely critical of the game. He described its gameplay as \\"horrible\\", and criticized it for being too distant from the gameplay of the original Pac-Man. He wrote: \\"Overall, Pac & Pal is a travesty. In my mind, it holds the title as worst and weirdest Pac-Man sequel ever unleashed upon the world. Avoid this game.\\" In his review of the Xbox 360 version of Pac-Man Museum, Hardcore Gamers Jahanzeb Khan called it a \\"far more unusual sequel\\" to Pac-Man, and criticized Miru for being more of a hindrance than an aid to the player. Writing for Paste, Preston Burt listed it among the weirdest Pac-Man sequels for the addition of a second player character and its premise, saying that: \\"If you have no idea what's happening in this game, you're not alone.\\" Jeremy Parish of USgamer retrospectively reviewed Pac & Pal in commemoration of its 30th anniversary in 2013. He claimed that it made for one of the stranger entries in the series for its substantially different gameplay compared to Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man. Parish also said that many of the game's additions, namely Miru and the power-up items, detracted from Pac-Man more minimalist approach and appeal. Ultimately, Parish said that the new mechanics and difference in play made it a much more difficult and stressful game compared to its predecessors, feeling that players would have a hard time succumbing to its \\"strange\\" ideas and gameplay that had a more action-oriented pace to it. He concluded his review with: \\"While Namco clearly hoped to sustain Pac-Mans tremendous legacy with an inventive follow-up, Pac & Pal hastened the series' demise. Pac & Pal was one in a string of duds and doesn't hold up very well in retrospect -- it's a real oddball of a game. Sometimes, though, weirdness is just as interesting in hindsight as true significance.\\" Bobinator of Hardcore Gaming 101 argued that the difference in gameplay made Pac & Pal standout from other Pac-Man sequels, and that it helped make the game feel fresh and unique. He also believed that it represents Namco's willingness to experiment with the mechanics and concepts established in the original. Bobinator wrote: \\"Sadly, this would be the last time Namco would ever experiment quite this much with their well-used maze game formula. While Pac-Man would soon move into new genres entirely, later maze games would choose to play it safe. Experimentation like this would never be seen in the series again.\\" Notes References External links * Category:1983 video games Category:Arcade games Category:Pac-Man arcade games Category:Maze games Category:Namco arcade games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Yuriko Keino ","title":"Pac &amp; Pal"},{"id":"3614871","text":"Thomas Codrington (1829 in Wroughton, Wiltshire ‚Äì 1918) was a British engineer and antiquarian of the late Victorian era. With a career background as an Inspector for local government, he published several known works. First was Report on the Destruction of Town Refuse, published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office in 1888. This was only a short pamphlet of 48 pages, including illustrations of furnaces in use at the time. Codrington went on to write the slightly more substantial 172 page work The Maintenance of Macadamised Roads in 1879, published by E. & F.N. Spon. However, by far Codrington's most famous work was also one of his last. Roman roads in Britain, published originally in 1903, was the first attempt by any author to catalogue fully the evident remains of the Roman transport network in the United Kingdom. Several further editions were subsequently published, and indeed reprinted. The last of these was a reprint of the 3rd edition in 1928.

Terry and William T. Hutchison. The original intent of the organization was to ensure that veterans returning from the war in Iraq, would not be subjected to the same treatment as veterans of the Vietnam war, in which both Terry and Hutchison served. It has been largely defunct since 2010. Mission statement As of 2005, the mission statement of the organization included: * To promote the social welfare of the community (that is, to promote in some way, the common good and general welfare of the people of the community); * To assist disabled and needy war veterans and members of the U.S. Armed Forces and their dependents and the widows and orphans of deceased veterans; * To provide entertainment, care, and assistance to hospitalized veterans or members of the U.S. Armed Forces; * To carry on programs to perpetuate the memory of deceased veterans and members of the Armed Forces and to comfort their survivors; * To conduct programs for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes; * To sponsor or participate in activities of a patriotic nature; * To provide insurance benefits for its members or dependents of its members or both; or * To provide social and recreational activities for its members. Structure The IWVO structures itself into two groups. Members are veterans who join the IWVO but do not take any leadership role. Member Representatives are organized by state, and represent the IWVO and its directors in each state. Member Representatives provide support and outreach to their respective states. Most states have multiple representatives. In addition, some Member Representatives are directors for the organization. These include the National Legislative Director, National Media Director, National Membership Director, Chaplain, and other positions that the directors and founder create. Since inception, the IWVO has created a structure of a Commander and a series of Vice Commanders, similar to that of other veterans organizations.IWVO mailing list \\"Message from the commander\\" Events In late 2004, the IWVO began planning with Challenge Aspen, an adaptive sports organization based in Aspen Colorado, for a winter ski clinic to benefit IWVO members who were wounded in the war.Challenge Aspen: CAMO IWVO National Legislative Director Daniel Rosenthal organized the trip, and within three weeks of its conception, six soldiers, sailors and marines attended the clinic. Five of the sailors and marines were from Balboa Naval Medical Center in San Diego, CA. The sixth soldier was from Tallahassee, Florida, and was in the same unit as Rosenthal, who also attended. In 2005, a summer version of the clinic was founded, with more than 30 veterans attending, and it has since become an twice-annual event.

It is illegal in Cyprus as it involves trapping wild birds such as blackcaps and European robins. Trapping kills birds indiscriminately, thus internationally protected species of migratory birds are killed as well. Enforcement of the ban has been lax, so many restaurants serve the dish without consequence. As a result, almost 2,418,000 birds across the whole of Cyprus are estimated to have been killed during 2010. According to a BirdLife Cyprus report released in 2014, over 1.5 million migrating songbirds are killed annually, and the number is increasing each year. In 2015 it is estimated that over 2 million birds were killed, including over 800,000 on the British Territories and a further 800,000 on the British Territories in the autumn of 2016. The birds are trapped in either of two ways: Black, fine- mesh nylon fishing nets, which are difficult to see, are strung between planted acacia trees. Electronic bird calls lure the birds to entangle their wings and legs, or alternatively gravel is brought in by truck and is thrown at the base of the trees to scare the birds into the nets. Others are trapped using glue sticks made from the berries of a local tree or birdlime. The glue sticks are placed on the branches of trees, and any birds that perch on them are stuck until the trapper returns to kill them (usually with a tooth pick to the throat). Often the legs of the birds are so stuck to the glue sticks that they need to be pulled off. Protests against the removal of acacia scrub has resulted in 36 ha remaining in 2016, compared with 56 ha in 2014. The trappers defend their activity by citing the practice as traditional Cypriot food gathering and claiming that this has been an important source of protein for the natives for many thousands of years, even though the practice has been illegal since 1974. BirdLife Cyprus has identified restaurants as the main culprits as they provide the financial incentives. The enthusiasm Cypriots and many other visitors to the island have for this delicacy despite its illegality has resulted in the development of a very profitable industry. Poaching for ambelopoulia has been on the rise in recent years, involving by 2011 a \\"mafia-like operation\\" that include poachers, dealers, exporters, and restaurant operators that participate in the illegal business estimated to be worth about 5 million euro at that time. The birds reportedly sell for five euros each and it is estimated by Cypriot authorities to have earned criminals on the island 15 million euro in 2015. Since the entrails of the birds are not removed, as it is not cost-effective to do so, the consumer is encouraged to swallow the bird whole. Unsuspecting diners may be served much cheaper farmed birds such as immature quails by some restaurants.

It was last assigned to the 57th Adversary Tactics Group at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. Overview The 65th Aggressor Squadron was assigned 24 McDonnell F-15 Eagle aircraft, painted in camouflage schemes identical to those observed on Russian-manufactured Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker fighters and operated in conjunction with the 64th Aggressor Squadron, which performs a similar task using F-16 Fighting Falcons. On 30 July 2008, one pilot was killed and another injured when their F-15 crashed into the ground during a training mission. The Air Force inactivated the unit on September 26, 2014 due to Fiscal Year 2015 budget constraints imposed upon the Air Force that zero-lined the squadron's budget.http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/las-vegas/65th-aggressor-squadron- falls-prey-nellis-budget-cuts Its fleet was maintained by Flanker Aircraft Maintenance Unit, a section of the 757th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron.It was then reactivated on 9 May 2019 at Nellis Air Force Base.

Was reassigned to the U.S. Army Middle East Force in Egypt, July 1942, becoming part of IX Fighter Command. Took part in the British Western Desert Campaign, engaged in combat during the Battle of El Alamein and, as part of Ninth Air Force, supported the Commonwealth Eighth Army's drive across Egypt and Libya, escorting bombers and flying strafing and dive-bombing missions against airfields, communications, and troop concentrations until Axis defeat in Tunisia in May 1943. The unit participated in the reduction of Pantelleria (May‚ÄìJune 1943) and the conquest of Sicily (July‚ÄìAugust 1943). The squadron supported the British Eighth Army's landing at Termoli and subsequent operations in Italy, being reassigned to Twelfth Air Force in August 1943. It flew dive-bombing, strafing, patrol, and escort missions. In 1944, converted to Republic P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft and flew interdiction operations in Italy. They moved to Corsica on 30 March 1944 to operate as a separate task force. It flew interdiction missions against railroads, communication targets, and motor vehicles behind enemy lines, providing a minimum of 48 fighter-bomber sorties per day. Participated in the French campaign against Elba in June 1944 and in the invasion of Southern France in August. It engaged in interdiction and support operations in northern Italy from September 1944 to May 1945. The 65th flew its last combat mission on 2 May 1945. Remained in northern Italy after the end of the European War, demobilizing throughout the summer of 1945. It was reassigned to the United States in August 1945 without personnel or equipment and was inactivated at the end of August. =Cold War= Reactivated in August 1946 as part of Eleventh Air Force (later Alaskan Air Command) as part of the air defense forces in the northwest Pacific. Squadron began training new P-51 pilots at Ladd Field, Alaska. Later, it was equipped with F-80Bs in March‚ÄìApril 1948, F-80Cs in October‚ÄìDecember 1948, F-94Bs in the summer of 1951, and F-89Cs in September 1953. With these aircraft, the squadron provided fighter aircraft defense in support of the Alaska Area until late in the 1950s. In October 1969, the 65th Fighter Weapons Squadron took over the F-100D/F Super Sabre aircraft, personnel, and facilities of the 4536th Fighter Weapons Squadron at Nellis Air Force Base. F-100s tail coded \\"WB\\", only to become non-operational early in 1970. On reactivation was equipped with A-7D Corsair II ground attack aircraft, operating from Luke Air Force Base, Arizona and Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona. Conducted fighter weapons training with the A-7D until June 1975 when aircraft sent to Air National Guard units. = Aggressor training= 65th Aggressor Squadron F-5E Tiger II \\"Aggressors\\" aircraft, about 1980 The squadron was re-equipped in October 1975 with F-5E Tiger IIs, the aircraft having been originally destined for delivery to South Vietnam until that nation collapsed earlier that year and the aircraft subsequently becoming available. Since the F-5E had approximately the size and performance characteristics of a Soviet MiG-21, it was used throughout the US and overseas to teach adversarial tactics and provide dissimilar air combat training to US Air Force flying units, eventually becoming the 65th Aggressor Squadron. The squadron's F-5s carried no tail codes, although they did carry the Nellis black/yellow checkertail stripe and a Tactical Air Command emblem on tail. The aircraft were painted in Soviet Air Forces motif with subdued USAF markings, with the last two digits of the F-5's tail number painted in the then-Soviet style in red on the front fuselage, highlighted in white. Deployed throughout US and overseas to teach adversarial tactics and provide dissimilar air combat training to US Air Force flying units. Re-designated 65th Tactical Fighter Aggressor Squadron on 30 December 1981. Added subdued \\"WA\\" tail code in early 1987. Redesignated again as 64th Aggressor Squadron on 4 January 1983. Operated until 1989 when the F-5s began having structural problems with the airframes. As the Cold War ended and military budgets adjusted, the unit flew their last aggressor flight in the F-5 on 7 April 1989. =Return to aggressor training= F-15C Eagle 57th Wg 65th Aggressor Squadron AW 080010 - Nellis AFB NV - 2007 The squadron was reactivated in September 2005, flying F-15Cs and F-15Ds as the 65th Aggressor Squadron.

The process took place unnoticed and when Naftogas was constituted, not all privately owned distributors wanted to transfer their own stocks to the statutory fund of the National Joint Stock Company. Along with the gas distribution network in the same way there were privatized enterprises of petroleum products provision including filling station and fuel repositories that belonged to \\"Ukrnaftoprodukt\\".

Before Naftogaz, both Bakai and Didenko worked for other gas trading companies \\"Republic Corporation\\" and \\"Intergas\\". At the end of 1990s, Ukraine was consuming a record of 75 billion m3 per year which was the fourth indicator in the world and seemed strange to say the least considering that the country was not part of the top 20 in GDP volume. Eighteen billion m3 were mined inside Ukraine by Naftogas along with some joint enterprises such as \\"Poltavska Naftogasova Kompania\\", Plast, Ukrnaftogastekhnologia and others. All the gas that was mined by Naftogas and received through transit in obligatory order was being sold to population and state organizations. The remaining volume of natural gas, Ukraine was receiving from Russia as part of payment for transit or was buying from Turkmenistan. That gas was sold to industrial enterprises or was being re-exported. Also, instead of investing more funds in geological exploration for the Ukrgasprom, its money was used to patch budget and foreign debts holes, which led to decrease in mining of hydrocarbons and decline of industry. Most of oil refineries were sold out to Russian companies. The only refinery that belongs to Naftogas is Shebelynsky Gas Refinery which Naftogas controls through Ukrgasvydobuvannia. Ukraine never had enough mined oil resources capable to provide for oil refining capacity that Ukraine inherited from the Soviet Union. Most successful in oil mining is Ukrnafta, however recently Chornomornaftogas had more and more plans to develop newly found deposits. Before 2001 Ukraine had two state enterprises in transportation of oil \\"Main oil pipeline \\"Druzhba\\" and \\"Cisdnieper main oil pipeline\\". The pipelines were often used by Russian companies, but after Ukraine built connecting pipeline Odessa - Brody (Black Sea coast - West Ukraine) Russian companies installed an alternative pipe route Sukhodolnaya-Rodionovskaya. In 2001 several Ukrainian parliamentarians made inquiry to the Prosecutor's General Office, Tax Agency, and Security Service requesting to open a criminal case against the head of Presidential Administration Volodymyr Lytvyn, the former chairman of Naftogaz Ihor Bakai, the administration chairmen of joint- stock company \\"Ukrgasprom\\" Bohdan Kliuk, the director of state enterprise \\"Ukrgasprom\\" Illia Fik, and others.Andrei Kapustin.

As of 31 December 2008, Naftogaz with its subsidiaries had a total of 172,000 employees. Naftogaz received more than $6 billion of subsidies in domestic bonds from 2009 to 2012 as regulated gas prices and expensive Russian energy imports led to heavy losses. =2014‚Äìpresent= In August 2014, Ukrtransgaz, the operator of the Ukrainian gas transport system, along with its Slovakian counterpart \\"Eustream\\", launched natural gas supplies from Slovakia to Ukraine after signing a Memo of mutual understanding in April.en.itar-tass.com/economy/747723 This initiative was driven by Russia‚Äôs decision in June to cease gas supplies to Ukraine in retaliation for the country seeking closer ties with the European Union. By launching reverse flows, Ukraine claims it is seeking no concessions ‚Äì only implementation of existing EU law on EU territory. The Third Energy Package was proposed by the European Commission in 2007 and adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union in July 2009. This legislation clearly allows for gas to be traded like other commodities, thus creating a more efficient market which is less vulnerable to political pressure. In October 2014 the EU further committed to better connecting its energy grids, saying countries should be able to export 15% of their generation capacity by 2030. www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/490885ec-5b14-11e4-8625-00144feab7de.html#axzz3HM5FEtCS The consultancy firm Strategy& (formerly Booz & Co) believes the EU could save ‚Ç¨40bn a year by 2030 if it integrates its energy grids. www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/b8727392-592b-11e4-a722-00144feab7de.html#axzz3HM5FEtCS Slovakia can provide more gas than Ukraine needs. In 2013, Ukraine imported 25.8bcm. Slovakia could provide Ukraine with 30bcm. Ukraine is asking that the EU fully support west-to-east exports to Ukraine, which would eliminate the scope for Russia to use gas as a weapon to achieve its political aims in Ukraine. rt.com/business/168408-ukraine-begs-reverse-gas-eu Norway‚Äôs energy giant Statoil began transiting gas eastwards from Slovakia in 2014, and Shell began in 2015. In response to the reverse flows initiative, Russia has cut supplies to central and eastern European countries, seeking to prevent exports to Ukraine. www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/10/poland-russia-gas-supply- cut-gazprom-tensions-ukraine In September, Hungary stopped supplying gas to Ukraine, days after a meeting between Hungarian Prime Minister Orban and Gazprom‚Äôs CEO. www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/26/hungary-suspends-gas- supplies-ukraine-pressure-moscow Gazprom charges widely different prices to different European countries, which many believe is based on Russia‚Äôs political goals in the region. www.rferl.org/contentinfographics/gazprom- russia-gas-leverage-europe/25441983.html Ukraine is seeking arbitration from the \\"Stockholm Chamber of Commerce\\" to fairly assess past debts between the two countries and to establish a fair basis of future operations. www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/16/ukraine-crisis-naftogaz-court- idUSL5N0OX21G20140616 Since April 2014, Ukraine is the only non-EU country to voluntarily publish its volume in storage facilities on the EU transparency platform of Gas Storage Europe (GIE). The company also publishes data on the amount of gas entering and leaving the country. In November 2014, Ukrtransgaz, the operator of Ukraine‚Äôs gas transportation system, began posting daily statistics on the information platform of the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Gas (ENTSOG). Also, the same year Naftogaz launched a new website in order to showcase its transparency initiatives. In March 2018, \\"Naftogaz\\" won a trial against Russian Gazprom for shortened gas supplies before the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, and was set to receive net amount of $2.56 billion. As of 31 December 2017, Naftogaz has around 72,000 employees and annual revenue of ‚Ç¨7.443 billion. Of total revenue, ‚Ç¨2.908 billion (39.07%) is generated from oil and gas production, ‚Ç¨2.415 billion (32.45%) from oil and gas transit, ‚Ç¨1.137 billion (15.28%) from oil transmission and sales and ‚Ç¨817 million (10.98%) is generated from gas transmission and sales. Also, a total transit volume in 2017 stood at six-year maximum of 93 billion cubic meters. The transit contract between the Naftogaz and Gazprom is set to expire in December 2019, after which Ukraine will cease to be the main transit country of Russian gas to the European Union countries. In April 2019, the Chinese Sinosure agreed to loan $1 billion in insurance coverage to Naftogaz.

Ukraine has the largest storage capacity in Europe, which enables the country and its European partners to accumulate over 30 bcm of gas during summer periods when prices are lowest. Ukraine is also strategically placed to play the role of a transit hub. Its interconnectors have the ability to transfer gas from central Europe to South-Eastern Europe, which is the most exposed region to Russia's gas monopoly. Naftogaz asserts that ensuring gas flows freely will significantly improve the liquidity and the stability of the EU market, making it more resilient to political pressure. The company drills for oil in the Western Desert in Egypt. On December 13, 2006, Naftogaz and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation had signed an agreement on the exploration and development of oil and gas deposits on the eastern territory of Alam El Shawish East in the Western Egyptian desert.Naftogaz Ukrainy Starts Production Of Oil From Extension Well In Egypt, Ukrainian News Agency (February 24, 2009) In 2014 Naftogaz began natural gas extraction in Egypt. The company's oil production in Egypt estimated at 260,000 tonnes for 2014, which is more than 10% of annual production in Ukraine. A new natural gas pipeline allowing for extraction of approximately 300,000 cubic meters per day has also been launched . Criticism Naftogaz has been seen as one of the biggest sources of corruption in Ukraine for years with many of the country's billionaires having acquired much of their wealth through gas arbitrage based on differences between the prices of Russian gas imports, gas exports to the EU and government energy subsidies to homes and businesses. In October 2014, George Soros named Naftogaz to be \\"a black hole in the budget and a major source of corruption\\" and called for a radical reform of the company, which could \\"totally eliminate Ukraine's dependence on Russia for gas\\". Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty produced a short documentary entitled \\"The Palaces of Ukraine's Oil and Gas Men\\" about the homes of Naftogaz management during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, who was overthrown in 2014. www.rferl.org/media/video/ukraine-elections-oligarchs-palaces- reissue/26653954.html In October 2019, Naftogaz got caught up in the impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump in the US, when news broke that a group of businessmen with allegedly close ties to the President and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, intervened in an attempt to change the management of Naftogaz. An Associated Press report reveals how businessmen Lev Parnas, Igor Fruman and Harry Sargeant III allegedly attempted to replace Naftogaz CEO, Andriy Kobolyev, and sought to broker a deal to sell their own natural gas to the company.

It is a spin-off from Xevious, as the player's tank (which is the eponymous \\"Grobda\\") first appeared in that game as an enemy. It runs on Namco Super Pac-Man hardware but with a video system like that used in Mappy and The Tower of Druaga, and it also uses a DAC for the \\"Get Ready\\" speech sample at the start of each round. Gameplay The player avoiding collision from enemy projectiles. Grobda is a multi-directional shooter similar to the classic Atari 2600 game Combat (1977). The plot involves humans using powerful, laser- emitting vehicles in a dangerous competitive sport known as \\"battling\\", thousands of years in the future. In the game, the player assumes control of the Grobda, a screw-propelled tank capable of firing laser beams at enemies. The objective of each level, known in-game as \\"battlings\\", is to destroy all of the enemies while dodging their projectiles as quickly as possible. There are 99 levels total, each becoming progressively more difficult. Grobda's laser weapon is capable of destroying most enemies in one hit, although some carry shields that require additional shots to destroy. When an enemy is destroyed, it causes an explosion that will destroy any other enemies in its blast radius, including Grobda. The remains of the enemy are left in its place, which cause the Grobda to slow down if they move over them. Grobda has its own shield that briefly protects them from enemy fire, indicated by the meter at the bottom of the screen. The shield disappears if it is inflicted with enough damage, and does not refill until the next round. Development and release The eponymous Grobda was originally an enemy in Xevious (1983), where it evaded the player's air-to-surface bombs. Grobda was designed by Masanobu Endo and a small team of developers within Namco. Endo is best known as the creator of Xevious (1983) and The Tower of Druaga (1984), two widely- successful arcade games from the 1980's; most of the developers behind Grobda had worked on both titles. The Grobda was originally a defenseless enemy in Xevious that attempted to evade the player's air-to-surface bombs. Endo believed that the idea of giving Grobda powerful weapons and attacks was a humorous idea, and made for an interesting game concept. The game was planned and completed in three months, one of the shortest development times for a Namco game, and was developed on a small budget. The soundtrack was composed by Yuriko Keino, known for her work on games such as Dig Dug (1982). She envisioned the tempo for the background humming to become faster as the Grobda moved faster around the playfield. The current-sound hardware was unable to accomplish this, so Keino wrote a custom program that enabled it. Grobda was published in December 1984, running on the Namco Super Pac-Man arcade system board. In promotional material, Namco used the tagline \\"Grobda has awakened its combat instinct.\\" The game was distributed in North America by Magic Electronics in September 1985. Grobda was ported to the PC-8801 home computer in Japan the same year, developed by Dempa Software. Grobda has been included in multiple Namco Museum collections such as Namco Museum Vol. 2 (1996), Namco Museum Battle Collection (2005), Namco Museum Virtual Arcade (2008), and Namco Museum Megamix (2010). The latter also includes a minigame based on Grobda titled Grobda Remix, where players control Pac-Man as he must destroy as many enemies possible under a time limit. Grobda was added to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on November 16, 2009, alongside dozens of other Namco arcade games. Reception and legacy According to the arcade game magazine Game Machine, Grobda was one of the top arcade games of December 1984 by revenue. In 1998, AllGame labeled Grobda as \\"A refreshing departure from slower, more methodical tank shooters such as Combat and Armor Ambush\\", praising its fast- paced gameplay but criticizing its high-difficulty level. In a 2014 retrospective review, Hardcore Gaming 101 said that the game was a lot simpler in gameplay compared to Xevious, and felt mixed towards the games difficulty level. According to former Wolf Team designer Kazuyoshi Inoue, Grobda was an influence for Granada alongside Assault, as co-designer Toshio Toyota was a fan of arcade games. (Translation by Shmuplations. ).

Accident in 1973  On 30 July 1973, 18 coal miners lost their lives and a further 11 were seriously injured when a descending cage carrying the men failed to slow down as it approached the bottom of the mine shaft and 18 miners were killed by the impact. The accident was caused by fracture of the brake-rod, when a slowly growing fatigue crack reached a critical size and the brake-rod parted. Following a thorough investigation it was found that metal fatigue failure occurred in the braking mechanism used to slow down the cage as it descended.  Accident investigation using fracture mechanics  =Background= The main part of the set up is the winding motor which is driven by the dc motor. Two double deck cages are attached to the two ends of the winding rope. At the start of the winding cycle, power applied to winding motor is gradually increased and mechanical brake released. The cages accelerate then maintain a speed of until the cages approach the ends of the shaft. During deceleration, generator voltage driving the winding motor is reduced to produce regenerative braking and it is finally brought to rest by a mechanical brake. Mechanical brake consists of a pair of brake shoes applied to the underside of the brake paths by the action of the compressed spring nest operating through a system of levers. Force is transmitted from the spring nest to main lever through a diameter steel rod long.Demaid, A.P.A and Lawley, A., ‚ÄúThe Markham Mine Disaster‚Äù, Case Histories Involving Fatigue and Fracture Mechanics, ASTM STP 918, C.M. Hudson and T.P.Rich, Eds., American Society for Testing and Materials, Philadelphia, 1986, pp. 389-416 This vertical brake rod is always in tension as the springs are compressed. It also consists of a servospring mechanism which uses the compressed air to counteract the spring force to move the brake shoes away. For the sake of safety there is an automatic controller which cut off the power supply to winder motor and applies mechanical brake. Also there is an emergency stop button which activates the ‚Äòungabbling gear‚Äô which disengages brake control lever from Iversen type valve and applies mechanical brake. =Accident= On Monday, 30 July 1973 the winding engine man noticed some sparks under the brake cylinder when he started to retard the winding. He immediately increased regenerative braking and simultaneously pulled the brake lever to ON position. As there was no effect, he pressed the emergency stop button. This too had no effect and the cage crashed the bottom wooden landing baulks with enormous force which killed 18 and seriously injured 11 people. =Investigation= All electrical and mechanical components of the winding system were thoroughly investigated to find the cause of accident. Electrical systems were found to be working as supply of compressed air was available above the servo cylinder. However the brake shoes were about clear of the brake paths as the vertical brake rod had broken into two pieces. So the investigation concentrated on the failure of the brake rod. A chemical analysis proved that the material of the brake rod (carbon steel with the designation En8, conforming to British Standard 970:1947)Calder, J (1974) Accident at Markham Colliery Derbyshire HMSO London facsimile available from: https://webcommunities.hse.gov.uk/gf2.ti/f/6434/457221.1/PDF/-/Markham_Colliery_Accident_Report.pdf retrieved on January 17 2018 was within the specification demanded at the time of manufacture. Metallurgical examination of the brake rod showed that it failed because of fatigue. There were many secondary cracks around the fracture surface which were detected by magnetic particle technique. To investigate fatigue failure it was necessary to determine the inservice loading of the brake rod. The broken rod was replaced with a new rod and loading conditions were applied. Four strain gauges were attached at a distance of from the lower end, located 90 degrees apart around the circumference of the rod. Readings were taken during manual release and application of the brake and during emergency application of brake. The results showed that in addition to the expected direct tensile stresses at gauge positions there were substantial stresses due to bending when the brake was operated. The magnitude of stresses varied to such an extent that for the one farthest from the drum there was a change from tension to compression as the brake was released. The rod was not designed for such alternating bending loads. The rod was designed with a factor of safety 6.1 for tensile stress. But when alternative bending stress are induced, failure was inevitable. It was also found that mild steel bearing pad surfaces were badly worn as lubrication was not effective at bearings. This was also due to the unexpected bending stress which progressively squeezed the lubricant out of the gap. = Follow up = A National Committee for Safety of Manriding in Shafts and Unwalkable Outlets was formed and first met on 3 December 1973. The Committee produced two reports and an addendum.

The Ronnie Johns Half Hour (full name The Ronnie Johns Good Times Campfire Jamboree Half Hour Show (Now on Television)) was an Australian sketch comedy show produced by Jigsaw Entertainment and the Ten Network, which premiered in October 2005. The shows ran for approximately 30 minutes. The cast of the show came from a series of stage shows called The 3rd Degree, produced by Laughing Stock Productions, which featured selections from Australian university revues, and consists of Heath Franklin, Jordan Raskopoulos, Dan Ilic, Felicity Ward, James Pender, Caroline Fitzgerald and Becci Gage. Gage only appeared as a supporting cast member in the first series but has a more significant role in the second. Chris McDonald, creator and producer of The 3rd Degree stage shows, acts as the show's head writer and co-producer. Nikos Andronicos and Justin Heazlewood are credited as non-performing writers. The first season of the Ronnie Johns Half Hour ran for thirteen episodes The first six aired from October 2005 and the remaining seven aired from February 2006. The first series began airing in New Zealand on the C4 Network from 25 July. The second series began airing on 17 August 2006 at 9pm on channel 10, and is 13 episodes in length. In 2006, the show received a Logie nomination for Most Outstanding Comedy Series, and Franklin was nominated for the 2006 Inaugural Graham Kennedy Logie Award for Most Outstanding New Talent. The show hasn't been on since November 2006 and has not been on Network Ten's programming since. The 3rd Degree, although not officially disbanded, since 2006 has worked on solo projects, notably Heath Franklin as Chopper and Jordan Raskopoulos in The Axis of Awesome. The first and second series are available on DVD and are distributed through Sony.RONNIE JOHNS HALF HOUR: Herald Sun HiT Production The Ronnie Johns Half Hour was created after representatives from Channel 10 saw a performance of The Third Degree's stage show, and were impressed by the cast and characters. They offered the group the chance to film a pilot. Originally, the cast was going to call the show The 3rd Degree, after the name of their performance group. Channel 10, however, liked the idea of Ronnie Johns being the host, so they asked if the show could be renamed after him. In response, The 3rd Degree came up with a title that they felt was ridiculously long, The Ronnie Johns Good Times Campfire Jamboree Half Hour Show (Now on Television). The network shortened it to The Ronnie Johns Half Hour. Despite this, the writers, cast and prop designers try to sneak in The 3rd Degree's logo as much as possible in sketches. For example, football jerseys will have The 3rd Degree as their sponsor. Controversy The Ronnie Johns Half Hour often features risqu√© material on subjects such as sex and religion. The show often received complaints, particularly from religious groups. =Where did I come from?= The first episode of the series contained a sketch in which a father gave a very detailed description about his young son's conception when the son asked him \\"Where did I come from?\\" (which ended with line, \\"Then, I turkey-slapped [your mother] in the face!\\"). The sketch was all set to be broadcast, until shortly before the airing a controversial act involving genital slapping occurred on Big Brother. Since the sketch would have meant many complaints for the network, The 3rd Degree had to do a last-minute edit, with \\"Bunch of Flowers\\" being redubbed over the offending words. The uncensored version of the sketch was released online shortly after the first episode aired, and also appears under the Special Features on the DVD release of the series. =Jesus' mobile phone= One of the early sketches portrayed Jesus nailed to the cross having difficulty answering his mobile telephone. This generated a great number of complaints from Christian groups - according to the DVD commentary, Channel 10 received close to two hundred complaints. Several of these complaints claimed that the 3rd Degree \\"wouldn't dare do the same thing about Muslims\\". Two episodes later, they referred to these complaints and played an identical scene with Mohammed on the cross instead of Jesus, claiming it to be in the interests of equality. =High Five a Muslim Day= As part of the first Season, the Ronnie Johns Half Hour advertised a fictional Australian National Awareness Day, 28 February was announced as \\"High Five a Muslim Day\\". This event was heavily advertised on the show and the internet, with viewers encouraged to go out and find Muslims \\"or even people who just look like they're Muslims, 'cause they've been copping it too\\" and get happy with the schlappy. To this end, T-shirts and posters were printed and distributed around Australia at a variety of venues and events, including the Tropfest Film Festival. Initially, Network Ten were reluctant to screen the episode due to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy. However the Ronnie Johns team consulted a number of prominent members of the Australian Islamic community with the sketch. The sketch was met with praise by Islamic leaders and the 3rd Degree were even given a fatwah by the Mufti of Australia decreeing that the sketch promoted tolerance and understanding. The sketches began with a community announcement-style advertisement, where Jesus announced the day. This was followed up by a number of fake television commercials advertising the day and finally a montage of vox pops of the publics opinion towards High Five a Muslim day. At the end of the day when asked about the response the producers reported \\"T-shirts sold: 'A couple of hundred.' Complaints from Christians: Five. Complaints from Muslims: Nil.\\" =Jihadi Joe= In this sketch, the Ronnie Johns team employed two children to act in a \\"G.I. Joe\\" style commercial for the \\"Jihadi Joe\\" action figure. The sketch involved two toy twin towers which the kids then crash a plane into and begin to celebrate (√† la 9/11). The sketch then turns to heaven where Jihadi Joe is rewarded with 72 virgins. Recurring characters As well as many stand-alone sketches, The Ronnie Johns Half Hour features a number of characters who have appeared in multiple episodes. =Ronnie Johns= The title character of the show, Ronnie Johns (Franklin) is the \\"comedy cowboy\\"; he rides upon the \\"Good Taste Pony\\" (a papier-m√¢ch√© horse worn around his waist). Ronnie appears in the opening and closing scenes of the show, as well as occasionally interjecting between sketches, commenting on them and warning the audience about potential bad taste. He has a slight obsession with prairie dogs. =Paulie= Paulie (Raskopoulos), a young man of unknown Mediterranean heritage, dressed in a green-and-pink striped polo shirt, confronts various people to complain about what might be termed pedantic issues. For example, in his first appearance, he explains to a cashier at a store that gnocchi is actually made of potatoes, and should not be placed in the pasta aisle. Other complaints he made included wanting to change the nickname of the Australian soccer team because a \\"socceroo\\" isn't a real animal, and that George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is \\"incorrect\\" because its events did not occur in 1984. In a more recent episode, Paulie confronts the owner of an Adult Sex shop telling him that the \\"edible undies\\" should have a nutritional value printed on the box, just in case a vegan is starving to death and needs to know that there is no beef in them. At the end of each sketch Paulie recommends that the problem be solved by putting a sticker on the offending object, and assures the target of his complaint that \\"I've got my eye on youse\\". Perhaps to prove a point, the scenarios are often shown later on in the episode. On the Season 1 finale, it was revealed that Paulie's campaign against gnocchi began when his parents both ordered it at a restaurant, thinking it was pasta, and died from potato allergies. =Poppy= Poppy (Ward) is depicted as a small, innocent girl, who asks a stranger (most likely Pender) if they would like to look at her picture book. The book contains pictures of often controversial issues such as the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse or the Ku Klux Klan, but Poppy's narration describes them more naively, suggesting they are, for example, performing acrobatics routines or playing dress-ups. Her parents are drug addicts while her father is a Vietnam veteran and has an older brother who is homosexual, an older teenage sister who is pregnant, an uncle with a mail-order bride and has a gambling addiction which sends him homeless (and without a kidney) and a grandfather who is a WW II veteran. Like Paulie, events from past episodes and sketches sometimes occur again at a later date. =Gary and Gary= Gary (Pender) and Gary (Franklin) are two stereotypical English backpackers with an obsession for the TV soap opera Neighbours, particularly for the character of Toadfish Rebecchi. Whilst backpacking through Australia they grow quite bored of the sights and often complain about everything. However almost all of the sketches quickly lead to them relieving their boredom by indulging in their favourite pastime of kicking each other in the \\"janglies\\" - each takes turn to kick the other between the legs. This is the main example of faux English slang which the characters habitually use. Towards the end of the series an American backpacker, Chuck, joined the duo. The Garys shifted from only complaining about Australia to also making fun of Chuck and his country of origin. The 3rd Degree did not have permission to shoot some of the Gary and Gary sketches (particularly the ones filmed at Circular Quay), so they went to the location and filmed the sketches in front of the public. =Chopper Read= One of the few depictions of a real person, the infamous criminal Mark 'Chopper' Read (Franklin) appears as a special guest in various incongruous situations, such as reading a story for children a la Play School or calling numbers for bingo. Much of the humour in Chopper's segments derives from his penchants for swearing and violence, as well as his lack of education, as demonstrated in the bingo sketch where he points out \\"I can't even fuckin' count, and I'm gonna host bingo! It's just like bloody dingo but it's safer with your kids, isn't it?\\". Chopper also makes many threatening statements directed at Neville Bartos, a character based on a real person who the real Chopper allegedly shot before going to prison, but with whom Chopper is now good friends. Franklin's portrayal of Read is as much based on the real Chopper as it is on Eric Bana's take on the man as portrayed in the 2000 Andrew Dominik film of the same name. In the second season, rather than Chopper having a new job every week, the sketches are set in his apartment. In one episode Chopper introduces a Puppet version of himself, \\"Mini-Chopper\\", and teaches children about \\"Stranger Danger\\". In a later sketch he sings nursery rhymes. In another episode aired in an earlier timeslot, he mentioned that due to TV censorship laws he was restricted to saying the word fuck 15 times per episode, and after exceeding the 15-word limit, the word was bleeped from thereon. The sketch where Chopper presents the weather became something of a phenomenon on the internet, with people all over Australia forwarding the clip on to other people. Heath Franklin (the actor who plays Chopper) even had the sketch sent to him, which he found amusing. The real Chopper, in a TV interview, praised Franklin's comedic impression of him. =Social Suicide Bomber= The Social Suicide Bomber (Raskopoulos) is an awkward-looking man in a burgundy blazer and salmon-pink shirt who is summoned by people who are stuck in unpleasant social situations - such as an unattractive man flirting with a woman who doesn't want that kind of attention - by pressing a large red button. He drives away the unwanted person with banal comments or bizarre actions, like demonstrating his pterodactyl impersonation. Unfortunately, with that person gone, the Social Suicide Bomber then often turns his sights to the person who called him, creating a situation that was more awkward than the one to begin with. =The Nihilists= Simon (Franklin), Gretchen (Ward) and Sigmund (Pender) are a trio of apathetic Germans who dress in black and speak in monotonous voices. They appear in places that are usually the source of happy, bubbly personalities, like children's TV shows, aerobics shows, or as replacements for a department store Santa, and frequently make comments on the meaninglessness and futility of life, love and other endeavours. Gretchen is shown to be harbouring much aggression, and frequently has small outbursts of anger, and it is also shown her birthday is on the same day as Simon's. The Nihilists are based on characters that appeared in a Macquarie University comedy revue. The Nihilist sketch \\"Sigfeld\\" is a parody of Seinfeld where the trio act similar to Seinfeld while remaining in nihilistic character. =Windshadow and Jemima= Windshadow (Fitzgerald) is an \\"Earth Mother\\". She is continually embarrassing her school-aged daughter, Jemima (Ward) in front of Jemima's friend Steve (Pender) with her nature/fertility rituals. =Henry Limpton's Teabag= Henry Limpton (Pender) is a man with an unfortunate compulsion. He cannot help but dunk his scrotum (known as Teabagging) into his friend, Cochese's (Raskopoulos) food and beverages. This is played out in mime with campy sitcom music. Henry has ruined Cochese's beer, fruit punch and fondue. During the Christmas episode he \\"teabagged\\" a chimney while Santa was descending. In the pilot, the character was called \\"Henry Lipton\\", until this caught the attention of Unilever, owners of the Lipton tea brand. Unilever threatened to pull all their advertising from Channel 10, but were placated by the insertion of the 'm' in the character's surname. =Jesus Christ= The son of God. Jesus (Pender) finds himself in many sketches on the show however his sketches do not have a common stylistic or narrative link. In one sketch he was trying to reach his mobile phone while crucified. In another he was challenged to avoid \\"towel-flicking\\" someone's bottom and on another occasion he was the spokesman for \\"High Five a Muslim Day\\". Some sketches have Jesus teamed up with Mohammed, portrayed by Ilic. =Rastus= A puppet dog (voiced and controlled by Ilic) with a left political outlook. Whenever Rastus encounters statements that he doesn't agree with, whether it be a right wing house guest or a talk-back radio host Rastus responds with barks, growls and even attacks. The sketches often end with Rastus' owner, Miles (Franklin), being persuaded not to put up with the person any longer and telling the character \\"No, Rastus is quite right, I think you're full of shit.\\" =Phillip Mandrake= Phillip (Raskopoulos) is a bearded man in an overcoat who goes shopping. He makes a small inquiry about the item he wants to purchase, usually a foodstuff (mangoes, ice-cream, free-range eggs and some ming dynasty vases) and after he purchases three of the item he throws them on the floor and steps on them dramatically. When the shopkeeper asks him 'What did you do that for?!?!' He then turns to the seller of the item and says that he didn't like the item e.g. \\"I don't like your mangoes.\\" After each skit, as Mandrake is walking away, old horror movie like music plays. =Single Entendre Man= Single Entendre Man (Raskopoulos) is famous for making outrageously explicit comments in a direct manner (i.e. without euphemisms). Sketches often involve his friend (Ilic) making a double entendre comment only for Single Entendre Man to respond with an explicit comment that has the same meaning as the double entendre about a relative of the friend. =Ranger Dan= Ranger Dan (Ilic) provides the public with the 3rd Degree's community service announcements. He advocates bizarre initiatives such as giving homeless people violins to play sad music to distinguish themselves as genuinely homeless. Ranger Dan appeared to commit suicide in the final episode of series one, however, he returns in Series 2 to announce that ugly people would be given a guitar to make them more attractive. Ronnie Johns himself comments on this, saying \\"If you're only a little bit ugly, I recommend the ukulele!\\" =Wayne and Stacey= Wayne (Ilic) and Stacey (Fitzgerald) are a middle eastern couple. Wayne is a full- time Jihadist for Al-Qaeda. Wayne's terrorist ways often create trouble for their relationship. The scenes are played very melodramatically in a parody of soap operas. =Underground Girl and Underground Guy= An emo girl (Ward) and an emo guy (Raskopoulos) stand on a street corner and attempt to outdo each other with their knowledge of obscure \\"underground\\" bands and music. The sketches often become bizarre and absurd in a style reminiscent of Abbott and Costello's \\"Who's on First?\\". In a recent episode, they decided they need to come up with a new adjective other than \\"Underground\\" =Peter Cundall= Peter Cundall (Ilic) is another sketch involving the impersonation of a real person. Cundall, a celebrity gardener, reads from famous novels but ends up being sidetracked by references to gardening and manure. =Jihadist Council of Australia= A terrorist (Raskopoulos) appears on a low quality video warning the Australian public. The warnings initially point to a terror attack (\\"Don't catch a train on Sunday\\") but in the end are revealed to come from genuine concern (\\"...There's going to be track work on the red line\\"). =Arnie the Koala= Arnie (Franklin) is a drug addicted koala. The Arnie sketches feature nature documentary footage that has been dubbed with voices. The sketches are in reference to the fact that eucalyptus leaves have a doping effect when they are eaten. =Trevor and Dianne= Trevor (Franklin) and Dianne (Gage) are an elderly couple who enjoy caravanning. On their holidays they meet people who they bore and annoy with their barrage of tedious conversation. =That's Amazing= A parody of TV shows like Ripley's Believe it or Not and Guinness World Records hosted by an unnamed character played by James Pender. The sketches depict different people on the show performing tasks which are quite mundane. Nonetheless the studio audience is still enthralled and chant the phrase \\"That's Fucking Amazing\\" at the end of every sketch. =Mlak Mlak= (Voiced by Franklin; Illustrations by Raskopoulos) Mlak Mlak is a World Vision \\"sponsor child\\" in Africa. Every month he receives $1.50 from the 3rd Degree. He sends in drawings and letters describing what he has done with the money and usually complains about what a pittance it is. In recent episodes he has been shown as a gangster rapper named M-lak Daddy asking for \\"A Dollar Fiddy Cent\\", a play on his catchphrase and the rap artist 50 Cent, to help his malnourished backup singers get some \\"booty\\". =Try Hard Mum= A mother (Ward) attempts to be cool in front of her daughter (Fitzgerald) and her daughter's friend (Gage) but only succeeds in embarrassing herself by revealing how little she knows about the topic of conversation. =Sergei Haminov= Sergei Haminov (Raskopoulos) is Russia's Rubik's Cube champion. He appears in numerous adverts endorsing products and says to \\"put it in your hole\\". The products are Pseudo-Russian Bastardisations of well known western products such as Schnickers (a parody of Snickers) and Kentucken Frucken Chicken (a parody of KFC). He also starred in two other ads that change his catchphrase to \\"put it on your pole\\". This has been for condoms and lubricant (called 'KBG Jelly' a parody of 'KY Jelly') . He recently featured in an ad for a Russian men's magazine, Rolph (a parody of Ralph). He has also endorsed a product called \\"Cocoa Poops\\" (a parody of Coco Pops). =Tank Mum= A mum just like any other, apart from the fact that she drives a tank. In one skit she drops her son and daughter off at primary school. They forget to take their lunches with them and the mum shoots it at them with the tank's cannon. =Red Man and Green Man= A set of pedestrian traffic light containing a Red Man (Pender), and Green Man (Raskopoulos). The Green Man is continually annoying the Red Man by making the \\"time to walk\\" noise at inappropriate times. For example, on their second appearance Green Man asks Red Man to swap places. Red Man initially refuses but then agrees. Green Man makes the \\"time to walk\\" noise and cars can be heard crashing afterwards. Red Man usually calls Green Man a dick. =Stephen Xerxes= Also known as The Finger Guy, Stephen (Pender) is a man who pretends to be pulling an object from his pocket but in facts flips off the person, followed by oohs and aahs. He generally performs this act to a figure of authority such as a bus ticket collector, a police woman, or a judge. Sometimes these sketches break character continuity. The character is generally depicted as a young man in a gray hoodie but has also been portrayed as a politician and a medieval knight. =Castaways= Three men have survived a plane crash at sea. Their names are Stan (Raskopoulos), Tom (Pender) and Kevin (Franklin). Tom and Stan have want to light a fire and set up help signals on the beach. Kevin says that they must turn to homosexuality to survive \\"for warmth and safety\\" and that there's no shame in this. He cuts his clothes to look like a woman's and changes their help sign to \\"Homo\\". =Proletariat Psycho= (Raskopoulos) A man who cuts up human flesh (similar to an Ivan Milat/Mick Taylor type character), and gives words of wisdom to the people at the same time. =NYPD= The New York City Police Department which features a tough, hardass chief (Raskopoulos), who actually has a heart of gold, and his main officer Kageti (Pender). Kageti is a good cop loose cannon who has to constantly deal with the aforementioned Chief. The Chief and Kageti both enjoy donuts but think that coffee tastes like shit. Recurring Themes Not only are there recurring characters, there are also recurring themes in the show. =Things You Shouldn't Do Naked= These sketches begin by announcing an activity that should not be done whilst naked and assigning the activity a number. The sketches then depict one of the cast members performing the activity. The humour comes from the fact that the activities are things that should not be done at all, naked or otherwise such as eating a surfboard, towel whipping a bear or impersonating the Crazy Frog ring tone. According to the Season 1 DVD commentary, when Heath Franklin appears in one of these sketches he is the only actor to do his naked scenes in the nude, the rest of the cast wore flesh-coloured underwear. =Poofta Bog√¢n= Poofta Bog√¢n is a brand for the Australian bog√¢n, who is also a bit gay. Items in the Poofta Bog√¢n range include a cologne, dating web site \`pooftaboganmatchmaker.com.au\`, the Poofta Bog√¢n Manw√¢gon (The Manwagon is a Smart Car with a tray on the back) and an alcoholic drink called \\"Inhibition\\". =Don't do Drugs= These sketches start off with sped-up black and white stock footage accompanied by frantic music and finish with the message \\"Don't do Drugs\\". Cameos and Easter Eggs Throughout each episode there are always a number of hidden jokes or cameos. You may see characters from previous sketches hiding in the background or a prop or product reused. For example, there was a sketch about South African Cola. Throughout the series you would see characters drinking this beverage in other sketches.

It is about three of Santa Claus' helpers who ride on Santa's sleigh each Christmas. The short has become an annual \\"Christmas Classic\\" first on Johnstown, PA WJAC-TV and then following on Chicago's WGN-TV and since its introduction in the mid-1950s. The film is entirely in black-and-white. The short was originally created by Centaur Productions utilizing the stop-motion talents of artist Wah Ming Chang; Chang's influence on the special can be seen through the visibly Chinese facial features of the elves and especially Santa. Its running time is about 2 minutes and 45 seconds. This cartoon is traditionally broadcast with their two other short Christmas cartoons, \\"Suzy Snowflake\\" and \\"Frosty the Snowman\\". According to the narrative song, Hardrock drives Santa's sleigh, and Coco navigates with maps. Santa \\"has no need for Joe/ but takes him 'cause he loves him so\\". (However, in the Bozo the Clown special \\"A Bozo Christmas,\\" Coco states that Joe, who was unable to go with them that year due to illness, was in charge of crisis management.) Part of the charm of this primitively- made cartoon is that Joe, the smallest of the three, and very boyish-looking, has a deep bass voice. Chorus: :Oh-lee-o-lay-dee, o-lay-dee-I-ay :Donner and Blitzen, away, away :Oh-lee-o-lay-dee, o-lay-dee-I-oh :I'm Hardrock! :I'm Coco! :I'm Joe! The program is available on DVD from the Museum of Broadcast Communications. Parody A new generation of animation lovers was introduced to this Christmas classic via the short-lived Comedy Central television series, TV Funhouse, a spin-off of the recurring Saturday Night Live cartoons. In the series' third episode, \\"Christmas Day\\", the Hardrock, Coco, and Joe short is satirized under the name \\"Christmas With Tingles\\" in which an elf named Tingles magically spreads tension and guilt during the Christmas season. Aside from the subject matter, the spoof stays remarkably faithful to the original, featuring black-and-white stop-motion animation, as well as spoken lyrics backed by an a cappella chorus: :Yo-dee-yo-die-deedle, deedle-ee-dee :Awkwardness and anxiety, :Yeedle-dee-doo-deedle, dee-deedle dension :\\"I'm Tingles the Christmas Tension!\\" The tune of the song featured in the \\"Christmas With Tingles\\" short is almost identical to the tune of the song featured in the Hardrock, Coco, and Joe \\"Three Little Dwarfs\\" cartoon. This was also referenced in a Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode (Prince of Space). Other recordings The song was also recorded by Gene Autry, but in Autry's version, Joe is depicted as having a high, childlike voice, not a bass one.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6G2uRfYQSVw See also *Bozo, Gar and Ray: WGN TV Classics References Category:1951 animated films Category:1951 films Category:American animated short films Category:Santa's helpers Category:Christmas characters Category:American children's animated fantasy films Category:American Christmas films Category:1950s American animated films Category:American films Category:Stop-motion animated short films Category:1951 short films Category:1950s stop-motion animated films Category:1950s children's animated films Category:1950s children's fantasy films Category:1950s Christmas films ","title":"Hardrock, Coco and Joe"},{"id":"3614954","text":"Protective duct with bundle of microducts and cableMicroducts are small ducts for the installation of small microduct fibre optic cables. They have a size ranging from typically 3 to 16 mm and are installed as bundles in larger ducts. Stealth Description Microducts are typically small-diameter, flexible, or semi-flexible ducts designed to provide clean, continuous, low- friction paths for placing optical cables that have relatively low pulling tension limits. As stated in industry requirements document Telcordia GR-3155,GR-3155-CORE, Generic Requirements for Microducts for Fiber Optic Cables, Telcordia. Generic Requirements for Microducts for Fiber Optic Cables, microduct products are expected to: * Be compatible with existing construction designs and building configurations for both riser- and plenum-rated applications, including cable blowing apparatus. * Allow cables to be safely deployed through pull lines or strings using less than 50 lbs of force, and through cable blowing techniques at typical deployment speeds of 100-200 feet per minute. Types of ducts GR-3155 states that the basic types of duct are smoothwall, corrugated, and ribbed. The selection of a particular duct design is dependent on those characteristics that are important to the end-user. The need for a specific characteristic or combination of characteristics such as pulling strength, flexibility, or the lowest coefficient of friction will dictate the type of duct required. Duct options Ducts can be purchased with a variety of options or features. One such enhancement is pre- lubrication. Pre-lubricated ducts may be either permanently impregnated with anti-friction compounds or coated with liquid lubricant during manufacture (see GR-3155). This may or may not eliminate the need for supplementary lubrication when pulling cable into the duct. Before using a supplementary lubricant with a pre-lubricated duct, the user should check with the manufacturer to determine if the added lubricant is compatible with the pre- lubricated surface of the duct. Failure to do this may result in the cable seizing up rather than reducing the friction coefficient of the duct. Placement of cable As indicated in GR-3155, cable is typically placed into the duct in one of three ways: * It may be pre-installed by the duct manufacturer during the extrusion process. * It may be pulled into the duct using a mechanically assisted or hand-drawn pull line. * It may be blown into the duct using a high air volume cable blowing apparatus. =Pre-installed cable= When cable is pre-installed, the duct manufacturer extrudes the duct directly over the optical cable. Tight control of the duct temperature during the manufacturing process is essential to ensure that the duct does not stick to the cable as it cools. At the completion of the process, all of the fibers in the optical cable must be tested to ensure that no damage has occurred. =Cable pulling= A common cable installation technique for fiber cables remains cable pulling. After the duct is placed, a high-strength pull line is blown into the duct (if one has not already been pre-installed by the duct manufacturer). The pull line is attached to one end of the cable and is used to pull the cable through the duct. =Cable blowing= Traditional cable pulling methods are very sensitive to the condition of the duct and to the number of bends and undulations throughout the duct route. Therefore, for microducts, Air-Blown (AB) cable installation techniques are expected to be the most useful. AB cable installation requires the use of a device that injects a high volume of air into the duct, at pressures as high as 20-25 psi. The viscous drag forces generated by the rushing air along the length of the cable act to reduce or overcome the friction between the cable and the duct. Traditional duct installation For telecommunications, cables can be installed in water, in air or underground. In the latter case, the cables might be direct buried or installed in ducts. The first is more common for copper balanced cables; the latter for fibre optic cables. The ducts in which the fibre optic cables are installed are usually made of polyethylene. They have a size ranging from typically 25 mm to 100 mm. Sometimes they are installed as subducts in larger ducts. These larger ducts can also consist of other materials, like concrete. The installation of fibre optic cables in ducts can be done by pulling or by cable jetting. Problems with fibre optic cables It is more difficult to make branching fibre optic networks in the access network than it is for copper balanced cables. Splicing optical fibres is much more difficult than connecting copper wires. In Fibre to the Home (FTTH), where a lot of branches are present in the network, an Optical Distribution Network is used to branch the cables from a roadside cabinet or pit that contains optical equipment and is fed from the Central Office Microduct cabling Jetting a bundle of microducts With microduct cabling, bundles of small microducts are installed in larger protective ducts . This can be done by jetting for example. Bundles of microducts can also be factory pre-installed. The microducts can be branched very easily in the network. At any place of choice, a window cut is made in the protective duct and the microduct of choice is cut. This microduct is then connected, using a simple push/pull connector, to a microduct that branches to the desired location. After all connections are made, an individual microduct path has been created in the network. A microduct cable can then be jetted through the microduct, without the need to make a splice. Advantages over traditional cabling # A branch can be made simply, any place, at any time. # Low initial costs. # The network can grow on demand. # Easy to install microduct routes in occupied ducts. # Easy to replace old cables through the network. # Possibility to migrate from copper balanced cables to fibre optic cables. Practice Jetting a microduct cable Today the microduct cabling technology is used more and more, all over the world. The fibre counts have grown up to 144 per cable and can be installed in microducts of only 8 mm inner diameter. Bundles of microducts can be jetted over 1500 m or more. Microduct cables can even be jetted over 3.5 km in one single shot. More length without splice is reached by placing jetting equipment in tandem.

The 414th is a non-flying organization charged with hosting Red Flag exercises, Air Combat Command's largest Large Force Exercise (LFE). The unit was originally formed as the 414th Night Fighter Squadron in 1943. After training, it was deployed to Twelfth Air Force during the North African Campaign to provide air defense interceptor protection against Luftwaffe night air raids. It later operated in Sardinia, Corsica, Italy, plus a detachment served in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge. It returned to the United States and was inactivated in 1947. It was reactivated as the 414th Fighter Weapons Squadron at Nellis in 1969, serving in that role until inactivated in 1983. It was activated again at Nellis in 1991 as the 414th composite Training Squadron. In 2005, it became a non-flying squadron managing Red Flag exercises. Mission Red Flag is a realistic combat training exercise involving the air forces of the United States and its allies. It is conducted on the bombing and gunnery ranges near Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. It is one of a series of advanced training programs administered by the Air Warfare Center and Nellis. The 414th coordinates the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcons flown by the 64th Aggressor Squadron and the ground-based air defenses operated by the 507th Air Defense Aggressor Squadron. History =World War II= 414th Night Fighter Squadron Bristol Beaufighter at a base in Tunisia, 1943 Established as the 414th Night Fighter Squadron in January 1943, trained in Florida with a specialized version of the Douglas A-20 Havoc modified for night combat.Pape, Campbell & Campbell, Deployed to Twelfth Air Force in Algeria, May 1943. Equipped with British Bristol Beaufighter, carried out defensive night patrols over Allied-held territory during the North African campaign, also conducted night interdiction raids on German positions in Algeria and Tunisia. After German collapse in North Africa, continued defensive patrols and offensive night attacks on Axis positions on Sardinia, Corsica, and in Italy. Detachment operated with Ninth Air Force in Belgium in late 1944‚Äì1945 during the Battle of the Bulge. Re-equipped with P-38Ms (modified Lockheed P-38J Lightnings) for night operations. Fitted with an AN/APS-6 radar in an external radome underneath the nose, relocated radio equipment and anti-flash gun muzzles in early 1945. The squadron stood down after the end of the European War, May 1945. Designated as not operational, June 1945 ‚Äì August 1946. Moved on paper to Shaw Field, South Carolina, 15 August 1946 and equipped with returned Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighters. Squadron was inactivated 16 March 1947, with aircraft being reassigned to the 319th Fighter Squadron (All Weather) and flown to Howard Field, Canal Zone, 1947 for defense of Panama Canal. =Cold War= 414th FWS F-4D Phantom, AF Ser. No. 66-8700, November 1972 Redesignated as the 414th Fighter Weapons Squadron on 22 August 1969, the squadron reactivated on 15 October 1969 at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, replacing the 4538th Combat Crew Training Squadron. Assigned to the 57th Fighter Weapons Wing, the 414th was tasked with combat crew training, using the McDonnell F-4C Phantom II aircraft. Aircraft initially tail coded \\"WD\\", wing tail code \\"WA\\" was adopted in October 1971. upgrading to the F-4D and last, the F-4E, tail coded \\"WA\\" with black/yellow check tail stripe.Martin, The 414th assumed the duties of the 4440th Tactical Fighter Training Group (Red Flag) on 1 March 1976, performing combat fighter weapons training with the F-4 until the end of 1981, when inactivated and squadron replaced by the F-4 Division of the USAF Fighter Weapons School. =Modern era= Former aircraft parking area for the 414th Combat Training Squadron. F-16C Block 32D, AF Ser. No. 86-0281, prominent in photo The squadron was redesignated as the 414th Composite Training Squadron and activated, on 1 November 1991, at Nellis. Assigned to the 57th Operations Group, and flying the F-16, the squadron was tasked with conducting Red Flag exercises. In 1993, the unit was renamed the 414th Training Squadron, and in 1994, the 414th Combat Training Squadron. Performed aggressor training with F-16C Fighting Falcons until 2005 when they were reassigned to the 65th Aggressor Squadron, 57th Adversary Tactics Group. Now a non-flying organization, the 414th, unlike most USAF squadrons which are typically commanded by lieutenant colonels, the present scope of responsibility of the squadron within the United States Air Force Warfare Center (USAFWC) is such that it is now commanded by a full colonel. While the 414th remains technically subordinate to the 57th Operations Group, it is now more analogous to group level-equivalent organization for administration of Red Flag operations.

The club's colours are green and white, its home is the Tsirion Stadium. Aris Limassol is one of the most historic football clubs in Cyprus dated since 1930. History One of the founder members of Cyprus Football Association, and was around between 5th and 7th position in the 1930s. During the 1940s, the team didn't compete in the Cypriot First Division, however they returned in the Cypriot Championship in 1954 and they were the first team to be relegated to the Second Division after finishing last in the table. The following season they became Champions in the Second Division and returned to be relegated again. Returning to the First Division, where after a good appearance in the First Division, they gained the fourth position. Being one of the weakest teams in the First Division during the 1960s, they were finally relegated in 1969‚Äì70 as 12th and remained for two seasons in the Second Division. The situation changed for Aris between 1975 and 1980 when the team won again the fourth position in 1976‚Äì77 and 1978‚Äì79. Two years after winning the fourth position, in 1981 the team were relegated again after finishing last (14th) but returned as runners up the following season and finished 5th in 1985‚Äì86. The greatest success of the club was in 1989 when the team qualified to the Cyprus Cup final, where they were beaten by AEL Limassol 2‚Äì3. The following season, in 1989‚Äì90, the club signed the Ukrainian Oleh Blokhin, the 1975 European Footballer of the Year, and helped them to win for another time the fourth position, which was the club's greatest position. After the end of the season, Blokhin ended his career playing for Aris Limassol. After the relegation in 1992‚Äì93, the team won the following season for third time the Second Division Championship. Since 1996‚Äì97, when the club was in Cypriot First Division, the team was then every year relegated to the Cypriot Second Division and the following year was promoted to the Cypriot First Division. That situation ended in 2006‚Äì07, when the team finished 8th in the championship and managed to remain in the Cypriot First Division. Aris was relegated to the Cypriot Second Division in 2008‚Äì09, the team finished in 2nd place and played in the Cypriot First Division in 2009‚Äì10 but was relegated again. In 2009‚Äì10 it reached the Cyprus Cup semi-final. In the next season 2010‚Äì11 the club was again promoted but finished 3rd from bottom in the 2011‚Äì12 season and was yet again relegated. In 2012‚Äì13 Aris won the Cypriot Second Division and was again promoted to the Cypriot First Division only to be relegated again after the 2013‚Äì14 season. In 2014‚Äì15 Aris finished third in the second division and was promoted to the Cypriot First Division. After 9 years of draught, Aris Limassol managed to remain in the Cypriot First Division in 2015‚Äì16 finishing in 10th place. Also, it was the only team that used more than 6 Cypriot players in the pitch in every match. =Supporters= Aris has a smaller number of fans than other Limassol clubs, but these are very committed to their club. As a result, they are often referred to as \\"the 300 of Leonidas\\", in reference to the famous 300 Spartan soldiers that delayed the Persian army at Thermopylae. =Other Sport Departments= Although the football team forms the centre of sporting activity for Aris, the club has over the years maintained teams in other sports including basketball, table tennis and chess.

Its largest city is Cairns and it is dominated geographically by Cape York Peninsula, which stretches north to the Torres Strait, and west to the Gulf Country. The waters of Torres Strait include the only international border in the area contiguous with the Australian mainland, between Australia and Papua New Guinea. The region is home to three World Heritage Sites, the Great Barrier Reef, the Wet Tropics of Queensland and Riversleigh, Australia's largest fossil mammal site. Far North Queensland lays claim to over 70 national parks, including Mount Bartle Frere; with a peak of it is the highest peak in both Northern Australia and Queensland. The Far North region is the only region of Australia that is home to both the Aboriginal Australians and the Torres Strait Islanders. Far North Queensland supports a significant agricultural sector, a number of significant mines and is home to Queensland's largest wind farm, the Windy Hill Wind Farm. Extent View from Daintree National Park, 2009 Various government departments and agencies have different definitions for the region. The Queensland Government department of Trade and Investment Queensland defines the region as an area comprising the following 25 local government areas; Aurukun, Burke, Cairns, Carpentaria, Cassowary Coast, Cook, Croydon, Doomadgee, Douglas, Etheridge, Hope Vale, Kowanyama, Lockhart River, Mapoon, Mareeba, Mornington, Napranum, Northern Peninsula Area, Pormpuraaw, Tablelands, Torres Strait Islands (not autonomous), Torres Strait Islands (autonomous), Weipa, Wujal Wujal, Yarrabah. Settlements The main population and administrative centre of the region is the city of Cairns. Other key population centres include Cooktown, the Atherton Tableland, Weipa, Innisfail and the Torres Strait Islands. The region also consists of many Aboriginal and farming groups. The northeastern point of Highway 1 passes through the region in the city of Cairns and connects the southern-running Bruce Highway to the western-running Savannah Way. Highway 1 circumnavigates the continent at a length of approximately and is the second-longest national highway in the world after the Pan-American Highway. Despite being Highway 1, not all sections of the Savannah Way are designated as a federally funded National Highway and certain sections remain unsealed. Industry Crops near Cardwell, Far North Queensland Significant industries include tourism, cattle grazing, agriculture and mining of both sand and bauxite. Agricultural products generate between $600 and $700 million a year. Sugar cane, tropical fruits including bananas, mangoes, papaya, lychees and coffee are grown in Far North Queensland. The region is home to the world's biggest silica mine at Cape Flattery. The mine was established in 1967 and was severely damaged by Cyclone Ita in 2014. Rio Tinto Alcan operates a bauxite mine on the western coast of Cape York Peninsula near Weipa which contains one of the largest bauxite deposits in the world. In recent years, Far North Queensland has become increasingly known for its artistic and creative offerings, with the Cairns Indigenous Art Fair, and Cairns Festival both held annually. Active arts organisation include the Tanks Arts Centre, Cairns Civic Theatre, and Cairns Art Gallery. =Tourism= Bloomfield Track in the Daintree Rainforest The region supports a large tourism industry and is considered a premier tourist destination in Australia. Nearly one third of international visitors to the state come to the region. Attractions include the Great Barrier Reef, Daintree Rainforest and other Queensland tropical rain forests within the Wet Tropics of Queensland heritage area, the Atherton Tableland, Hinchinbrook Island and other resort islands such as Dunk Island and Green Island. Major attractions around and in Cairns include The Reef Hotel Casino, Kuranda Scenic Railway, Barron Falls and the Skyrail Rainforest Cableway. Towns and localities attracting large numbers of tourists include Cape Tribulation, Port Douglas, Mission Beach and Cardwell. Demographics The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the region's population at 280,638 in 2014.National Regional Profile: Far North (Statistical Division) . Australian Bureau of Statistics. Retrieved on 27 January 2012. The region contains 25.6% of the state's Indigenous population, or 28,909 people, making up 11.8% of the region's population.Office of economic and statistical research History Yalanji (also known as Kuku Yalanji, Kuku Yalaja, Kuku Yelandji, and Gugu Yalanji) is an Australian Aboriginal language of Far North Queensland. The traditional language region is Mossman River in the south to the Annan River in the north, bordered by the Pacific Ocean in the east and extending inland to west of Mount Mulgrave. This includes the local government boundaries of the Shire of Douglas, the Shire of Cook and the Aboriginal Shire of Wujal Wujal and the towns and localities of Cooktown, Mossman, Daintree, Cape Tribulation and Wujal Wujal. It includes the head of the Palmer River, the Bloomfield River, China Camp, Maytown, and Palmerville. Far North Queensland is the location of the first amber fossils to be found in Australia. The four- million-year-old fossils were found on a beach in Cape York Peninsula but were probably washed ashore after drifting with the currents for about 200 km. In the 1860s, Richard Daintree discovered gold and copper deposits along several rivers which led early prospectors to the area. =Cyclones= The region suffered Queensland's worst maritime disaster on 4 March 1899 when the Mahina Cyclone destroyed all 100 ships moored in Princess Charlotte Bay. The entire North Queensland pearling fleet was in the bay at the time of the cyclone. Approximately 100 Aboriginals assisting survivors and 307 men from the pearling fleet were drowned. Its pressure was measured at 914 hPa with a recorded tidal surge of 13 m, the highest ever in Australia. The 1918 Mackay cyclone hit the Queensland coast in January of that year, killing 30 people. In March 1997, Cyclone Justin resulted in the deaths of seven people. In early 2000, Cyclone Steve caused major flooding between Cairns and Mareeba. Cyclone Larry crossed the Queensland coast near Innisfail in March 2006. The storm resulted in an estimated $1.5 billion worth of damage and damaged 10,000 homes. 80% of Australia's banana crop was destroyed. Cyclone Monica was the most intense cyclone on record in terms of wind speed to cross the Australian coast. It impacted the Northern Territory and Far North Queensland in April 2006. In January 2011, Cyclone Yasi passed over Tully and resulted in an estimated $3.6 billion worth of damage, making it the costliest cyclone ever to hit Australia. Tropical North Queensland The name Tropical North Queensland is sometimes used to refer to the region. However, the phrase is ambiguous and may be used to name a wider area including parts of North Queensland, or even Mackay.

She came to public notice when she was involved in the Falklands War of 1982. The final surrender of the war, in the South Sandwich Islands, took place aboard Endurance. Background Kr√∂ger-Werft of Germany built her in 1956 as Anita Dan for Lauritzen Lines. The UK government bought her in 1967 and had Harland & Wolff convert her. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Endurance, named after the sailing ship Endurance that took the explorer Ernest Shackleton's expedition to the Antarctic in 1914. Operational history =1967‚Äì1982= The new Endurance maintained a UK presence in Antarctica and the Falkland Islands during the southern summer. She also supported the British Antarctic Survey. She had a bright red hull, as is common for polar vessels to aid visibility but otherwise uncommon for the Royal Navy, so her crew nicknamed her The Red Plum. In February 1972 when the cruise ship Lindblad Explorer ran aground, Endurance was in the vicinity under Captain Rodney Bowden and took part in the rescue. The Ministry of Defence's 1981 Defence White Paper proposed naval cuts including decommissioning Endurance, which was scheduled for 15 April 1982. =Falklands War= Endurances withdrawal from Antarctic patrol without replacement was perceived in Britain House of Commons debate 23 March 1982; Hansard Vol 20 col 798‚Äì801The Times 25 March 1982, p 13: letter from BG Frew, Hon Sec UK Falkland Islands Committee as having encouraged the Argentine invasion. The subsequent Franks Report acknowledged that it \\"may have served to cast doubt on British commitment to the Islands and their defence\\". HMS Endurance (A-171) in Portsmouth harbour in 1988 On 19 March 1982, while Endurance was at Stanley, British authorities there received news that an Argentine navy ship had landed Argentine civilians on South Georgia who had raised the Argentine flag. The Argentine group (containing Argentine Marines in mufti) posing as scrap-metal merchants, occupied the abandoned whaling station at Leith Harbour on South Georgia. Endurance, commanded by Captain Nick Barker, was sent to order the Argentines off the island.Britain Small Wars Freedman, Lawrence and Gamba, Virginia, Se√±ales de Guerra. Javier Vergara Editor, 1992. (in Spanish), page 81ss. Endurance had a small Royal Marines detachment and took further Marines from Naval Party 8901 (NP 8901), and sailed on 21 March for South Georgia. Arriving on 25 March 1982 Endurance encountered the Argentine transport , whose 40 Argentine troops had come ashore while the scrapping operation took place. Endurance landed her marines, then returned to the Falklands on 30 March. In April the UK command ordered Endurance to join the UK Task Force, which in April landed SBS soldiers at Hound Bay on South Georgia on 22 April. Task Force vessels moved into deeper waters as a precaution against Argentine submarines, but Endurance moved into sea ice near the shore. Endurance was involved in combat action on 25 April 1982 when her two Wasp ASW helicopters took part in attacks on the submarine , which was later abandoned by her crew. When Argentine forces surrendered the next day, Endurance remained near the island to show the UK flag, maintain a naval presence, and guard the waters. Endurance also took part in the rescue of wildlife film-makers Cindy Buxton and Annie Price, who were caught up in the war while working on South Georgia. After the Argentine surrender of the Falkland Islands, Endurance, , and the tug Salvageman sailed to the South Sandwich Islands, where Argentina had established a base in South Thule since 1976. Endurance was carrying a Wessex helicopter for the first time, in addition to her two Wasps. The ten Argentine military personnel surrendered after they saw HMS Yarmouth's firing display and when they realised recce marines from Endurance and 42 Commando Royal Marines had landed. The surrender was signed in the wardroom of Endurance. =1983‚Äì1991= Toward the end of her life the ship was nicknamed HMS Encumbrance due to reliability problems. In 1989 she struck an iceberg, and, although she was repaired, a survey in 1991 found that her hull was not sound enough for a return to Antarctica, so she was finally decommissioned. She was replaced by , later renamed .

Cassidy was born on January 8, 1900, to parents Herbert Cassidy and Maria Morris Cassidy, transplanted Maritimers who ran a general store. In 1916 Cassidy enlisted underage in the army, spending the next three years in uniform and returning to Canada in the spring of 1919. Harry Cassidy was a pioneer in the field of social work. He was the founding dean of the School of Social Welfare at University of California, Berkeley in the early 1940s before resigning to work for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. He subsequently became dean of the School of Social Work at the University of Toronto. He went on to hold distinguished posts in public service, and in the 1930s and 1940s contributed to national debates about the role of the state in welfare and education. In the 1930s he was involved with the League for Social Reconstruction and was a founding member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, however, in 1950 he ran for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party coming in second in the party leadership convention. Cassidy conducted studies of welfare services beginning in the 1930s and 1940s and influenced the creation of a Canadian welfare state and improved social services as a means of improving society and alleviating poverty. During the Great Depression he argued that the government of R.B. Bennett should create a broad system of social services such as Unemployment Insurance as a shock absorber against poverty. His research influenced Bennett's decision to try to emulate Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal and some of his ideas were ultimately taken up by the Liberal government of William Lyon Mackenzie King in the 1940s, particularly after Cassidy published his 1943 study Social Security and Reconstruction in Canada. He continued to criticize Canada's social security system as inadequate, writing in 1947 that \\"The provisions for general assistance are limited, restrictive, mean, and antiquated ... .[T]hey are literally disgraceful and unworthy of a nation of Canada's status\\". He also worked for a period in the civil service as deputy minister of welfare in British Columbia. Cassidy's son, Michael Cassidy, was a New Democratic Party politician and leader in the 1980s and 1990s. After Cassidy joined the army he began to keep a diary, perhaps inspired by recognition of a change in his social role and its familiar routines. These diaries have been published by the Champlain Society. References *Irving, John Allan: A Canadian Fabian: the life and work of Harry Cassidy. University of Toronto: PhD thesis, 1983.

The creation of this Uniformed Group was initiated by the Ministry of Home Affairs in response to the need for the young leaders of tomorrow to have a firm pillar and grounding in Singapore's firm belief of Total Defence. Together with the National Police Cadet Corps, both corps have their Headquarters located at the Home Team Academy. History NCDCC was introduced in 12 secondary schools starting from January 2005. For the pilot phase, 38 cadets completed the very first NCO Course while 22 teachers were commissioned as the pioneer batch of NCDCC officers after their completion of the first Officer Basic Course. On 23 December 2005, 22 cadets attended the conversion course and became the pioneer batch of Cadet Lieutenants or CLTs for short. Civil Defence is one of the current six pillars of Total Defence; it refers to the protection of the Singapore people by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). NCDCC is a component of the Home Team Cadet Corps Initiative. Mission and Vision Mission \\"To develop and empower our youths to be active and concerned citizens advocating life-saving skills.\\" Vision \\"A Choice Uniformed Group of Community First Responders.\\" Pledge \\"We, members of the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps, pledge to serve our community. We take pride in our training and uniform. We are discipline and responsible for our actions. We are loyal to the Nation.\\" NCDCC Specialisation Model Launched on 8 April 2017 during the 12th NCDCC Day Parade, the NCDCC Specialisation Model aims to provide all Secondary Three NCDCC cadets an option to specialise in either Fire Safety, Medical Response or Urban Search and Rescue Specialisation Courses based on their strengths and interests. These courses are co-developed with and conducted by the respective field specialists, modelling after the key functional areas of the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). Cadets are exposed to authentic learning experiences through realistic simulation and case studies to enable them to take on the role of Community First Responders, in line with the SGSecure Movement to assist themselves and people around them in times of emergency. Cadets are also trained in skills to be a more effective communicator and leader in their units. NCDCC‚Äôs Specialisation Model is the top 2 nominations recognised as a Best Practice, under the Organisation Development category, for the inaugural MOE HQ Best Practice Awards 2017 which aims to recognize HQ Divisions that have implemented best-in-class practices which are aligned to MOE‚Äôs mission, vision and values. The MOE HQ BPA Award is aligned to the Public Service Transformation (PST) Awards 2018 ‚Äì Best Practice Award Category. The Specialisation Model also succeeds the similar Senior Non-Commissioned Officer Course (SNCO) that have been conducted previously since the formation of the Corps. = Fire Safety Specialisation = The Fire Safety Specialisation Course empowers cadets with the skills and knowledge of general fire safety standards and provisions. Cadets go through a series of practical activities and learning journeys to have a first-hand experience in the operations of fire protection devices, fire drill and enforcement checks. In addition, cadets are also introduced to the concept of Fire Investigation to learn from realistic simulations and cases simulating the damaging effects of fire. At the end of the course, cadets can assist their school unit and community as fire safety ambassadors. The trainers of the course, the SCDF Fire & Rescue Specialists, will also share their real life experiences through cases they have attended to in the course of their duties. Upon successful completion of the course, cadets will be awarded with an iron on tab with the words 'FIRE SAFETY' printed on it that can be worn on the left side of their No.4 uniform under the rank, signifying them as cadets having passed out with the required knowledge and expertise in the Fire Safety Specialisation Course. = Medical Response Specialisation = The Medical Response Specialisation Course equips cadets with case studies of common emergencies and in-depth approach to perform critical emergency interventions. The course also imparts theoretical knowledge and practical skills for the resuscitation of collapsed adult and infant victims and the use of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) to restore normal heart rhythms. The SCDF paramedics and NCDCC personnel who have responded to real life emergencies will be invited to share their real life experiences in applying the triangle of life to save someone's life. Upon successful completion of the course, cadets will receive a Provider Certificate in Standard First Aid, Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) and AED, which are accredited by the Singapore Resuscitation & First Aid Council. Additionally, cadets will be awarded with an iron on tab with the words 'MEDICAL RESPONSE' printed on it that can be worn on the left side of their No.4 uniform under the rank, signifying them as cadets having passed out with the required knowledge and expertise in the Medical Response Specialisation Course. = Urban Search and Rescue Specialisation = The Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) Specialisation Course involves the searching of victims, accessing into voids, providing medical stabilisation and the extrication of victims trapped under structural collapse. SCDF's USAR capability is internationally accredited by the United Nations Disaster Assistance Council. Under the codename 'Ops Lionheart Contingent', SCDF's elite Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team (DART) travel to different parts of Asia Pacific to render USAR assistance to countries affected by disaster. The participants of the NCDCC USAR Specialisation Course will be introduced to the overview of USAR operations, basic search and rescue skills, hazard identification and psychological first aid. Participants will be taught how to recognise risks associated with collapsed structure and go through simulation exercise to render help and evacuate surface trapped victims away from risk areas using simple rescue tools from well-known rescue tools companies such as LUKAS. The NCDCC USAR Specialisation Course is supported by the United Nations International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG). This is the first course involving secondary school students to be given the prestigious recognition. Upon successful completion of the course, cadets will be awarded with an iron on tab with the words 'URBAN SEARCH AND RESCUE' printed on it that can be worn on the left side of their No.4 uniform under the rank, signifying them as cadets having passed out with the required knowledge and expertise in the Urban Search and Rescue Course. Rank structure Rank structures are implemented in all Uniform Groups with the common ambition of motivating the cadets and encouraging them to be on a constant roll and quest for trying out new things. File:National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (Singapore) Cadet Ranks.jpg Cadets All cadets will start off holding the rank of private, after which will be promoted subsequently, however promotion is based on badges count and completion of courses. The ranks are as follows: *Private (PTE) *Lance Corporal (LCP) *Corporal (CPL) *Sergeant (SGT) *Staff Sergeant (SSG) *Warrant Officer (WO) Cadet Officers Cadet officers are cadets who have graduated from their secondary school and are currently studying in an post- secondary institution, and have pass out from the Cadet Lieutenant Course.

Currently located at the Louvre 17th century alt= Dances in Iran or Iranian dances (Persian:ÿ±ŸÇÿµ ÿß€åÿ±ÿßŸÜ€å) are dance styles indigenous to Iran. Genres of dance in Iran vary depending on the area, culture, and language of the local people, and can range from sophisticated reconstructions of refined court dances to energetic folk dances. The population of Iran includes many ethnicities, such as Kurds, Azerbaijanis, Turkmen, Jews, Armenian, Georgian peoples, in addition to numerous Iranian tribal groups which can be found within the borders of modern-day Iran. Each group, region, and historical epoch has specific dance styles associated with it. Raghs (also spelled as Raqs) is the Arabic word for dance, and is almost exclusively the word used for dance in Persian, as the Persian word for dance, paykubi, is no longer in common usage. It is also the word in Azerbaijani for dance (Reqs). The Kurdish word for dance is Halperke, and the Lurs from Lorestan use the word BƒÅkhten (or BƒÅzee) for dance.  History  The people of the Iranian plateau have known dance in the forms of music, play, drama or religious rituals and have used instruments like mask, costumes of animals or plants, and musical instruments for rhythm, at least since the 6th millennium BC. Cultural mixed forms of dance, play and drama have served rituals like celebration, mourning and worship. And the actors have been masters of music, dance, physical acts and manners of expression. Artifacts with pictures of dancers, players or actors were found in many archaeological prehistoric sites in Iran, like Tepe Sabz, Ja'far Abad, Chogha Mish, Tall-e Jari, Cheshmeh Ali, Ismaeel Abad, Tal-e bakun, Tepe Sialk, Tepe Musian, tepe Yahya, Shahdad, Tepe Gian, Kul Farah, Susa, Kok Tepe, Cemeteries of Luristan, etc. The earliest researched dance from historic Iran is a dance worshiping Mithra (as in the Cult of Mithras) in which a bull was sacrificed. This cult later became highly adhered in the Roman Empire. This dance was to promote vigor in life. Ancient Persian dance was significantly researched by Greek historian from Herodotus of Halikarnassos, in his work Book IX (Calliope), in which he describes the history of Asian empires and Persian wars until 478 BC. Ancient Persia was occupied by foreign powers, first Greeks, then Arabs, and then Mongols and in turn political instability and civil wars occurred. Throughout these changes a slow disappearance of heritage dance traditions occurred. Religious prohibition of dancing in Iran came with the spread of Islam, but it was spurred by historical events. Religious prohibition to dancing waxed and waned over the years, but after the Iranian Revolution in 1979 dancing was no longer allowed due to its frequent mixing of the sexes. The Islamic Revolution of 1979 was the end of a successful era for dancing and the art of ballet in Iran. The Iranian national ballet company was dissolved and its members emigrated to different countries. According to the principles of the ‚Äúcultural revolution‚Äù in Iran, dancing was considered to be perverse, a great sin, immoral and corrupting. As a result, many of the talented Persian dancers moved to the West and spread out mainly in Europe and the United States and a new generation of Iranian dancers and ballet artists have grown up in the Diaspora.  Genres of dance  Iran has four categories of dance: chain or line dances, solo improvisational dance, war or combat dances and ritual or spiritual dances. * Chain or Line dances are often named for the region or the ethnic groups with which they are associated. * Solo dance usually includes reconstructions of Safavid and Qajar Court Dance. These often are improvisational dances and utilize delicate, graceful movements of the hands and arms, such as wrist circles. * War or Combat dances imitate combat, or help train the warrior. It could be argued that men from the zurkhaneh (a traditional Persian style gymnasium) called the ‚ÄúHouse of Strength‚Äù and their ritualized, wrestling-training movements are known as a type of dance called Raghs-e-Pa but could also been seen as a martial art. * Ritual or spiritual dances, are often Sufi are known as sama and also a type of zikr (religious chant). There are various types of dancing in a trance for healing practices in Iran and surrounding areas. One healing ritual that involves trance, music, and movement is called le‚Äôb guati of the Baluchis of Eastern Iran, which is performed to rid a possessed person of the possessing spirit and appears to be in a similar state as an exorcism. There is a term in Balochi, gowati, for psychologically ill patients (possessed by wind) who have recovered through music healing, music as medicine. The southern coastal regions of Iran such as Qeshm Island have a similar possession by wind ceremony and it is thought that it may be influenced or originated in Africa, particularly the Abyssinian or Ethiopian region. The word sama, from the Arabic root meaning \\"to listen,\\" refers to the spiritual practice of listening to music and achieving unity with the Divine. Dancing mystics (regardless of their specific religious identifications) are called Dervish. Contemporary social dances and urban dance performed at festive occasions like weddings and Noruz celebrations focus less on communal line or circle dances and more on solo improvisational forms, with each dancer interpreting the music in her own special way but within a specific range of dance vocabulary sometimes blending other dance styles or elements.  Iranian dance styles  Basseri dance This is a list of some of the ancient and contemporary Iranian dances, from various ethnic groups within Iran. * Baba Karam, a chain dance, derived from a Sufi story whereby a servant at the court of the king falls in love with one of the harem girls and sings this song out of grief from not being able to be with her, traditionally featured male dancers but nowadays also performed by women. Baba Karam sometimes refers to contemporary Persian Hip-Hop dancing. * Bandari dance, a chain dance, is often referred to as Persian bellydance. Bandari dance is a chain dance that often involves multiple people dancing and often perform this at parties, traveling around in a circle and sometimes stepping into the centre for a solo with encouragement from other dancers, the only variations are in the arm movements. It is a Persian dance that prevails in the South of Iran next to the Persian Gulf and has been influenced by the African and Arabic music and dance. It is a combination of rhythmic movements in various directions according to the beat of the song. The distinct feature of this dance is the way performers wave their hands in a unique manner that resembles the cooperation of a group of fishermen at the sea. The word bandari means \\"of the port\\" and is a derivation of the Persian word bandar, meaning port. * Basseri dance is a traditional dance performed by the Basseri tribe who live in the Fars province. The dancers wear their traditional and colorful clothes. * Bojnordi dance: Bojnord is a village in the northeast section of Iran inhabited by a Turkic people. Men and women dance separately or together in Bojnordi dance, snapping their fingers in the method known as peshkan. Dancing in a circle with running and step hop steps, the dancers may turn alternate directions facing first one side then the next, dancers sometimes facing one another. Men or women may dance and wave small colorful scarves, called dastmal. * Choob bazi, also known as chob bazi, chub-bazi, √ß√ªb-b√¢z√Æ or raghs-e choob, is a chain dance found all over Iran, performed by men with sticks, the name translates to English as 'stick play'. There are two types of Choob bazi dance styles, the first one being more combative in style, only performed by men (normally only two men, assuming the roles as the attacker and the defender) and does not appear to have a rhythmic pattern; this style is more frequently found in Southwestern Iran. The second style Choob bazi is a circle or line dance with pattern, performed by both sexes and is more of a social dance. * Classical Persian court dances, solo dances, improvisational, often utilize delicate, graceful movements of the hands and arms with animated facial expressions are central to the concept of that difficult-to-define flirtatiousness. Persian classical dance has not been organized and codified. Thus each dancer creates her own style and improvises within a recognizably Persian framework of movements. Costumes for these types of dance feature rich silks, brocades and flowing long skirts. * Haj Naranji dance: an upper body motion is emphasized, with hand motions, trunk undulations and facial expressions being points of attention. * J√¢heli is a dance popularized in the 1960s and 1970s by the Persian dancer Jamileh. It is part of an Iranian sub- culture that has its origins in the 9th and 10th centuries, a period when Turkic and Mongol tribes seeking pasturage and pillage formed an incursion in eastern Iran. Local, informal constabularies were formed to protect each town or village and the men of these groups, called j√¢hel (meaning ‚Äúignorant‚Äù in Farsi), along with women, developed a culture and dance with a mixture of street smarts and spirituality. * Khaliji dance: a contemporary dance done in largely improvisational, performed by pairs or groups of women for their own entertainment at special celebrations, such as weddings. There is also a type of Khaliji music from the Persian Gulf region. * Kereshmeh dance: solo, 19th Century Iranian royal court dance * Kharman dance * Khorasani dance * Latar dance * Le‚Äôb Guati: a spiritual dance by the Baluchis of Eastern Iran to rid a person of a possessing spirit * Lezgi dance: Azerbaijani and Caucasian folk dance; comes in variations of styles based on region * Luri dance * Matmati * Mazandarani dance * Motrebi dance: professional public dancers from the Qatar period, sometimes also prostitutes or party entertainment. In contemporary Iran this is a dance associated with low-class nightclub performers. * Qasemabadi, also known as Ghasem Abadi, is a chain genre, rice-harvesting dance of the Gilaki people from the Gilan province of Iran near the Caspian Sea. * Raghs-e-Pa, also known as Raqs-e Pa or Pay-Bazi, is the traditional gymnasium footwork dance found at zurkhaneh (a traditional Iranian gym). The name translates to English as \\"foot dance\\". * Raghs-e-Pari: Persian fairy dance * Raghs-e Parcheh: Persian veil dance * Raghs-e Sharqi: belly dancing * Ru-Howzi: a comic theatre performance on domestic life that includes some dancing * Sama-o-raghs: a spiritual Sufi dance of joy that involves chanting. Dancers move to the rhythm of the music, often continuing until they fall into a trance or collapse from exhaustion. * Shamshir dance: war dance involving a sword, also known as Shamshir-bazi; usually performed in Sistan and Baluchestan province * Shateri dance: classical Persian dance often compared to Arabic dance but without any hip movements * Tehrani dance: also known as Tehrooni, Tehran-style nightclub dancing * Vahishta: a Sufi, spiritual dance * Yalli, also known as Yally or Halay, an Azerbaijani chain folk dance, starts slowly and finishes fast at almost running speed. Traditionally it was a celebration of fire, which was a source of heat, light, and warm food. In ancient times dancers worshiped fire as a goddess. * Zaboli dance: a folk, chain dance, from the Sistan and Baluchestan Province in Southeastern Iran * ZƒÅr: a spiritual dance, from Southern coastal regions of Iran. People believe in the existence of winds that can be either vicious or peaceful and possess people. They are healed through a specific ceremony and dance.) * Zargari dance: a chain dance, from the Zargari people, a Romani-related ethnic group deriving from the Zargar, Iran area  Notable Iranian dancers  = Contemporary and historical Persian and/or Iranian dancers = This list of contemporary and historical Persian dancers or choreographers (in alphabetical order, of various dance styles) includes: * Sahar Azari * Helia Bandeh (Netherlands based, also heads a dance troupe called 'Helia Dance Company', traditional Persian dance) * Mina Vajik (she put a creative twist in pop dance culture of Iran) * Farima Berenji * Haydeh Changizian * Foroozan * Jamileh, Los Angeles-based, belly dancer * Farzaneh Kaboli, Iranian actress and dancer * Mohammad Khordadian, Iranian-American dancer * Shirin Kiani (Santa Barbara Ballet) * Maryam Mahdaviani (New York City Ballet) * Ana Janbazian * Cigana MahMah (of Sigana Choreographer, Dayereh Crew) * Mahvash, popular dancer and singer of the 1950s and 1960s * Masa (Los Angeles based dancer) * Medea Mahdavi (UK-based dancer and choreographer)http://www.footwork.org/medea * Afshin Mofid (New York City Ballet) * Shahrokh Moshkin-Ghalam (Paris based, modern dancer) * Abdollah Nazemi, dance choreographer and educator and founder of Pars National Ballet Company * Azita Sahebjam, dancer and director of the Vancouver Pars National Ballet * Kimiya Saleh (also known as Kimya Saleh), Japan-based, Iranian dancer specializing in Arabic style belly dancing * Mina Saleh, Japan-based, Iranian dancer specializing in Arabic style belly dancing * Shahrzad * Azar Shiva, Iranian actress and dancer = Notable Persian and/or Iranian dance ensembles = * Ballet Afsaneh, a female dance troupe focused on Persian culture along the Silk Road, based in the San Francisco Bay Area. * AVAZ International Dance Theatre, Iranian folkloric dance troupe with modernist influence, located in Los Angeles since 1977 * Khorshid Khanoom Dance, founded in 1995 in Montreal, Canada by Aram Bayat, in order to preserve and teach the Iranian traditional dance. * Niosha Dance Academy (NDA), founded by Niosha Nafei and located in Northern California * Pars National Ballet Company, founded by Abdollah Nazemi in 1966, located in Los Angeles, California. * Saba Dance Company, an Iranian folkloric dance troupe located in California. * Shahrzad Dance Academy (SDA), located in the San Francisco Bay Area. * Silk Road Dance Company (SRDC), Persian/Central Asian troupe located in the DC area since 1995 * Simorgh Dance Collective, founded by Farima Berenji in 2007, a dance collective headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. * Vancouver Pars National Ballet (also known as VPNB, in Farsi, Bale-ye Melli-ye Pars) founded by Azita Sahebjam (who studied under Abdollah Nazemi), located in Vancouver, Canada since 1989 See also * Persian theatre * Iranian music * Azerbaijani dances References External links * * Folk Dances from Persia, 1970s (Video by National TV, Tehran) * A Brief About Persian Dance by Dr. Peyman Nasehpour * Iran Dance & Ballet Resources * The Exquisite Art of Persian Classical Dance by Robyn C.

A Sega Genesis port was released in 1990. The game features a plot loosely based on Greek mythology. Gameplay Screenshot from the arcade version The player takes control of Apollo, who is mounted upon the back of his winged horse Pegasus; pressing the firing button makes his sword fire a tiny shot, while holding it down charges the sword up, and upon releasing the button the sword shoots a bigger fireball. Even the smallest enemies take multiple hits, so the standard shot is of little use - and each of the game's seven stages is divided into between two and four sections (the transition from one to another is indicated by a block of Japanese text appearing at the bottom of the screen and a change in music). At the end of every stage, Apollo must also defeat a boss character from Greek myth: Medusa, the Graeae, the Siren, Antaeus, Scylla (who has taken on the form of the \\"Crystal Brain\\" from the aforementioned Bakutotsu Kij≈´tei), Cerberus, and Typhon himself; once he has done so, he will proceed to the enchanted mirror at the back of the boss character temple, before the game segues into the next stage. Apollo can take up to four hits before dying (indicated by the \\"playing-cards\\" hearts at the bottom of the screen, and determined by how the cabinet is set), but will die instantly if he flies into a wall or touches a boss's head - and this game also features voice samples (in Japanese for the original arcade and Japanese Mega Drive versions, but in English for the North American Genesis and European Mega Drive versions). And if the \\"rank select\\" option in the arcade version's option menu has been set to \\"on\\", players will also be able to select an \\"easy\\" or \\"hard\\" game mode, once they have inserted their coin; however, the \\"easy\\" mode only features the first four stages and does not feature the game's complete ending sequence as a result of it. Plot The player takes control of the knight Apollo, the god of the sun, who sets off on the legendary winged horse Pegasus, to rescue his lover, Artemis, the goddess of the moon, from the Titan, Typhon. The game takes names and little else from Greek mythology in which Apollo, god of the sun, was actually Artemis's brother. The game shows players an Artemis that acts as a princess (but in Greek mythology, she was the goddess of the hunt, and took pride in never being with any man). Release The arcade version of this game was never released in the United States, due to Artemis's \\"bondage/torture\\" scenes, which were shown between each stage, and were similar to those from the new version of Namco's own Rolling Thunder; while no nudity is shown, the scenes were still somewhat \\"strong\\" to be shown in an arcade game during the early 16-bit era. This game's score display also gives the illusion of allowing values which do not end in \\"0\\", like Hopping Mappy, Bakutotsu Kij≈´tei, and Metal Hawk did before it - however, the smallest point value that the game can award to a player for killing an enemy is 10. Reception The Japanese magazine Game Machine listed Phelios in their March 1, 1989 issue as being the third most-popular arcade game at the time.

It is located in Balboa Park in San Diego, California.The cultural center supports and encourages the creative expression ‚Äúof the indigenous cultures of the Americas.‚Äù It is currently a member of the American Alliance of Museums. The Centro provides classes and presentations on drama, music, dance, and arts and crafts, many of which have origins in Mexico and \\"Aztl√°n,\\" a term used by Chicanos to indicate a return to a spiritual homeland and indigenous traditions and knowledge systems. Programs include Danza Azteca, Teatro Chicano, film screenings, exhibits, musical performances, installation art, readings, receptions and other events. The Centro's resident Ballet Folklorico company, Ballet Folklorico en Aztlan, also operates a dance academy at the Center. In addition, the Centro is available as a meeting place for community groups and organizations. The Centro's circular building has offices, workrooms, studios, and a theater. The performance space seats 150 people and has a 2,000 square foot art gallery. The Centro is one of the first community-based Chicano cultural centers and one of the largest in the Southwest. It is identifiable by a number of murals painted near the building's main entrance. History The origins of the Centro go back to the mid 1960s. Social protests, such as anti-Vietnam war demonstrations and work of activists like Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez leading with the United Farm Workers had given rise to grass-roots community movements in San Diego. Those involved with social protest saw that there would also be a need for a community center that was run by Chicanos and for Chicanos. At the San Diego State University, the Mexican American Youth Association (MAYA) was formed to recruit Chicano students to the university and make sure that they were able to complete their studies. This group, along with the Mexican American Liberation Art Front (MALAF) both recognized the need for a cultural center. In addition, MALAF also noticed that there were few places for Chicanos to exhibit their art. Alurista, a poet, and artists Guillermo Aranda and Salvador Roberto Torres, were all involved with MAYA, later to become M.E.C.H.A. and were very active in working towards both a cultural space as well as a space to create and show art. In 1968, the San Diego Parks and Recreation Department gave Torres permission to use the abandoned Ford Building in Balboa Park as a studio space for 6 months. Torres invited other visual artists and eventually the Ballet Foklorico en Aztl√°n, a folkloric dance group led by the Enrique family to use the space. Those involved included Alurista, Ochoa and Torres as well as Guillermo Aranda, Ruben de Anda, Leticia de Baca, the Aguilar sisters, Tomas Casta√±eda, Mario Acevedo Torero, Luis Espinoza, Ricardo Gonzalez and Antonio Rivas. The Ford Building by 1969 was a \\"major center of activities for San Diego's Chicano artists.\\" Other artists such as Guillermo Rosette and musicians such as the Trio Moreno became involved at this time. They formally named themselves \\"Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n\\" in order to be able to create a more solid group identity. Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n wrote this as their founding principle: \\"The Tolecas en Aztl√°n shall be constituted of all those Chicano Artists dedicated to Human Truth and Chicano Beauty, which in our belief can only be lived up to through Mutual Self-Respect, Self-Determination in our endeavors, and the Self-Sacrifice of our individual differences for the sake of a Centro Cultural de la Raza where our indigenous ancestral spirit of brotherhood, justice and peace can flourish in contemporary Chicano Art Forms.\\" Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n had forty members by 1970. Plans were begun to convert the Ford Building into Centro Cultural de la Raza. First, Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n petitioned the city of San Diego to use the building to create a cultural center. The proposal for the Centro went before city council, to the current mayor, Frank Curran, and to other Chicano organizations and interested individuals in order to gain support. The city of San Diego, however, had begun making plans to turn the Ford Building into an aerospace museum. According to Ochoa, the city and the \\"establishment\\" were uncomfortable with what the Toltecas were doing in Balboa Park. He says, \\"At one time there was 300 cars outside the Ford Building -- all Mexicans. They never saw so many Mexicans in Balboa Park before.\\" At the same time that Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n were petitioning the city to create a cultural center, in another part of San Diego where there had once been a vibrant Hispanic barrio, citizens were occupying the former neighborhood and demanding the city turn the space into a park. Torres and other members of Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n were involved in this protest, calling the area Chicano Park. The Chicano Park protest and other issues became part of a new proposal, citing a great need to create Centro Cultural de la Raza. The new proposal was brought to the city by Alurista, Torres, and Aranda. Despite this, the city attempted to evict the artists from the Ford Building. Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n refused to leave. In October, the Chicano Federation of San Diego County became involved and helped Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n express their concerns to the city manager, Walter Hahn. Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n refused to leave the Ford Building until another site was given them for the center. Eventually the city offered to give them an abandoned water tank that was originally built in 1914. Alurista was largely responsible for the final negotiations which included use of the new facility and a city contribution of $22,000 to the new building. The monetary contribution from the city included improvements to the building such as installing lights, heaters, water and a wood floor for the Ballet Folklorico. Los Toltecas en Aztl√°n moved into the new building in May 1971 and worked hard to get the building ready for a grand inauguration on July 11, 1971. The grand opening ceremonies attracted over 500 people and included music, dance and an art exhibition inside the building. The first mural \\"La Dualidad\\" in the new Centro building was created by Aranda and a team of volunteers and was completed in 1984. Outside of the building are murals by Mario Aguilar, Aranda, Barajas, Arturo Roman, Neto del Sol, David Avalos, Antonio de Hermosillo, Samuel Llamas, Antonio Perez and Ochoa. The Centro was known internationally as a dynamic cultural center where academics such as Shifra Goldman, Tomas Ybarra Frausto and Chon Noriega could be found conversing with community members as well as artists such as Magu, Luis Valdez, Judy Baca, Sergio Arau, Lalo Guerrero, Jose Montoya, Barbara Carrasco, Gabino Palomares and El Vez. Groups that formed through the work of the Centro include: Ballet Folkl√≥rico en Aztl√°n, founded by Herminia Enrique; Treatro Meztizo and Trio Moreno, a musical group, BAWTAF (The Border Arts Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo). In addition countless artists, musicians, performers, writers, dancers and activists were nurtured at the Centro, including Culture Clash, Gronk, Guillermo Gomez Pe√±a, Lalo Lopez Alcaraz, the Taco Shop Poets, Yareli Arizmendi, James Luna, David Avalos, Dora Areola, Chicano Secret Service, Richard A. Lou, Robert J. Sanchez, and Isaac Artenstein - all of whom have achieved prominence in the arts and culture community.  Boycott  A seven- year boycott (2000‚Äì2007) of the center was carried out by many artists, supporters, community members and even one of the founders, Ochoa. The dispute left the Centro in a \\"tenuous state.\\" Disagreements with changes made by new administrators of the Centro caused the rift.  Today  As a cultural center, the Centro not only promotes creative expression in art and formal art classes, but also includes in its busy schedule a variety of workshops in danza folkl√≥rica as well as other interpretive dance forms, music, theater, spoken word, drumming and more. In addition, numerous public presentations including exhibitions, concerts, installations, theater, dance, spoken word and multimedia events take place at the Centro. The Centro currently operates on a budget of $30,000 a year with no employees and only volunteers working for the organization.

Tufts the Indian Commissioner in Muskogee, Indian Territory, to police the Five Civilized Tribes. Their mission is to \\"provide justice services and technical assistance to federally recognized Indian tribes.\\"https://bia.gov/WhoWeAre/BIA/OJS/ojs-services/index.htm The USIP, after its founding in 1880, recruited many of their police officers from the ranks of the existing Indian Lighthorsemen. Unlike the Lighthorse who were under the direction of the individual tribes, the USIP was under the direction of the Indian agent assigned to the Union Agency. Many of the US Indian police officers were given Deputy U.S. Marshal commissions that allowed them to cross jurisdictional boundaries and also to arrest non-Indians. United States Indian Police Academy The United States Indian Police Academy was originally established as the United States Indian Police Training and Research Center in Roswell, New Mexico on December 17, 1968. The program was administered by the Thiokol Chemical Corporation during the academy's period in Roswell and specialized to include the training of juvenile detention, criminal investigation, and supervisors. In 1973, the academy was relocated to Brigham City, Utah to be combined with the Division of Law and Order Research and Statistical Unit from Pierre, South Dakota. The result was the creation of the Center for U.S. Indian Police Training and Research. The academy relocated to Marana, Arizona in 1984. In 1993, it was relocated again to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center grounds in Artesia, New Mexico, where it remains to this day. Today, the United States Indian Police Academy caters their training to the needs of the Indian Country Justice Services. The academy is designed to teach future USIP officers how to fulfill the unit's mission to \\"prevent crimes, reduce recidivism, and support tribal justice systems.\\" The positions generally filled by graduates include police officers, correctional officers, criminal investigators, tribal court staff and telecommunication equipment operators. Steven Juneau is the current Academy Director and Osceola Red Shirt is the Deputy Academy Director.https://www.indianaffairs.gov/cs/groups/xojs/documents/text/idc2-061311.pdf Jurisdiction The USIP was given authority over cases of manslaughter, murder, assault, rape, arson, and burglary in Native American communities with the passage of the Major Crimes Act of 1885, now codified as 18 U.S.C. 1153. However, the role of the USIP was often unclear and there was a continual need for new acts to increase its jurisdiction because of a lack of prior planning. The power of the United States Indian Police to arrest whites, half-Indians and those outside the reservation of their jurisdiction were continually challenged. This power was questioned in the case of U.S. v. Clapox, but the decision was left unclear. Maintenance of prohibition in Indian territory was passed in what is now 18 USC 1152, 1156, and 1161. These being passed further gave the USIP jurisdiction over non-Indians as the majority of bootleggers were Caucasian, though most of those arrested by the officers were their Native American customers who did not have the same access to quality attorneys. The 1913 Appropriation Act gave United States Indian Police the same powers as U.S. Marshals. The Johnson v. Gerald's case, 234 U.S. 422, further solidified the confiscation powers of the USIP in a decision about whether it was the place of the USIP to take or destroy Indian-made beverages or products.http://www.tribal- institute.org/download/Indian%20Law%20Enforcement%20History.pdf Pre-USIP law enforcement While some tribes later policed by the United States Indian Police did not give individuals law enforcement responsibilities and made order a community effort, others had institutions similar to police. The Muscogee Creek had an organization whose purpose was to enforce the laws created by the tribe. The group was composed of warriors who had reached a certain level of renown. The Cherokee had both their own form of police, the Lighthorse, and the court system. In fact, the attempt to replace the pre- existing law enforcement of the Native American tribes was marked by opposition from many tribes. The Commissioner received a letter from an agent of another Indian police force about the difficulties he'd met with Sioux opposition. \\"[T]here have existed among the Sioux and other tribes, native soldier organizations systematically governed by laws and regulations. Some of the opposition encountered in endeavoring to organize the police force in the spring of 1879 was from these native soldier organizations.\\" Interaction with outlaws One of the major setbacks for the United States Indian Police was the activity of prominent Western outlaw gangs, including the Cooks, the Starrs, and the Daltons. One of the members of the Dalton gang, Bob Dalton, used his position as Chief of the Osage Police to the benefit of his and his gang's bootlegging careers. The Dalton Gang was also well known for murder and bank and train robberies, using Indian Territory to evade Oklahoma officers. These groups would often fire upon USIP officers so as not to be captured and their bootlegging drew Native Americans under USIP jurisdiction into criminal activity as they consumed illegal goods the groups smuggled in. The outlaw problem became so dire that, in 1895, the Indian policy for officers included instructions for how to handle outlaws: \\"Arrest all outlaws, thieves, and murderers in your section, and if they resist you will shoot them on the spot.\\" Sam Sixkiller Sam Sixkiller was a former High Sheriff of the Cherokee Nation who was recruited to become the Captain of the US Indian Police in 1880. In 1886 two Indians killed Sam Sixkiller, the Captain of the US Indian Police and a Deputy US Marshal commissioned by the Judicial District of Western Arkansas. He was known for surviving multiple gun battles over six years of service, he was unarmed when he shot on a Christmas Eve. After the killers escaped indictment by the Creek and Cherokee, Congress passed a law (24 Stat., 463.) giving the United States district courts jurisdiction over any Indian who committed a crime against a federally appointed Indian police officer or United States Deputy Marshal. His death also resulted in a law making it a federal offense to kill an Indian police officer, which is still in effect. (18 U.S.C. 1114.) Other Indian police There were two other types of police officers on the reservations: * Indian tribal police *: Several Indian tribes replaced hereditary chiefs with constitutional governments. These tribes hired police officers under a number of different titles‚Äîsheriffs, constables, regulators, lighthorsemen, etc.‚Äîto enforce tribal laws. * Indian agency police *: Many tribes had no recognizable governments and therefore no tribal laws. On these reservations, the Indian agent assigned to the tribe hired Indian police from among tribal members to affect law and order according to Federal, agency, and treaty rules. These were considered federally appointed police officers. The Indian police that killed Sitting Bull were of this kind.

Its shares are listed on the Main Board of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and it is a constituent of the Hang Seng Index. 58% of its issued shares are owned by the Chinese state-owned CITIC Group. It is principally engaged in financial services, resources and energy, manufacturing, engineering contracting, real estate and other businesses. Business areas CITIC Limited previously known as CITIC Pacific is a diversified company with a primary focus on special steel manufacturing, property and iron ore mining, which supplies the raw material needed in the making of special steel and property development in mainland China. CITIC Pacific's operating segments include special steel, iron ore mining, property, civil infrastructure, power generation and other business areas. CITIC Pacific's subsidiaries include CITIC Pacific Mining, CITIC Pacific Special Steel, Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited and CITIC Telecom International. DCH Holdings is a distributor of motor vehicles, food and consumer products. CITIC Telecom International owns and operates a telecoms hub that provides interoperability, interconnections and value-added services. On March 3, 2011, CITIC Pacific announced its results for the full-year ended 31 December 2010. Profit attributable to shareholders was HK$8,915 million, the second highest in CITIC Pacific's history. The increase in profit was also driven by the gains from special steel business and sales of assets, which totalled HK$3,008 million. The Sino Iron project is being developed by CITIC Pacific Mining, a wholly owned subsidiary of CITIC Pacific. It is located at Cape Preston, 100 kilometres southwest of Karratha on the coast of Western Australia's North Western region of the Pilbara. The Sino Iron project will mine magnetite iron ore that once processed, can be exported for use in the steelmaking process, where it is a desirable quality product for steel mills, including those of CITIC Pacific in China. The Sino Iron project is intended to help satisfy demand from China's steelmaking industry by providing a reliable source of high quality iron concentrate. The products from the Sino Iron project will not only be used in CITIC Pacific's special steel mills in China, but also in other Chinese steel mills. One of the advantages of magnetite concentrate is its high iron content and low impurities compared to traditional iron ore products. The project was conceived in 2006 with a total cost of under $2 billion. However costs by 2012 had reached $7.1 billion, leading to disputes among the partners of the project. In July 2012, with production due to begin within weeks, the budget was increased further to US$8 billion. The increase was attributed to lengthy delays, cost overruns, the rising Australian dollar, labour shortages and the introduction of the carbon and mining taxes. As one of CITIC Pacific's main businesses, CITIC Pacific Special Steel is the largest manufacturer dedicated to the production of special steel in China with two operating steel plants ‚Äì Xingcheng Special Steel and Xin Yegang. Through expansion, the company's annual steel producing capacity increased to eight million tonnes at the end of 2010. This will grow to nine million tonnes by the end of 2011. The two steel plants are ideally located to cover the main markets for special steel in eastern and central China. Major products include the following categories: bar steel, wire steel, mid to thick wall seamless steel tubes, special steel plates and special forging steel. These are widely used in various industries, including auto components, machinery manufacturing, oil and petrochemicals, transportation, energy, railways and shipbuilding. On the property line of business, most of CITIC Pacific's properties are large-scale projects with locations in mainland China. These include Shanghai's Lu Jia Zui New Financial District project, the Sichuan Beilu Station and The Centre in Jiading, which form part of the city's new railway transport system.

For part of its history Ottobeuren Abbey was one of the 40-odd self-ruling imperial abbeys of the Holy Roman Empire and, as such, was a virtually independent state. At the time of its dissolution in 1802, the imperial abbey covered 266 square kilometers and had about 10,000 subjects. First foundation It was founded in 764 by Blessed Toto, and dedicated to St. Alexander, the martyr. Of its early history little is known beyond the fact that Toto, its first abbot, died about 815 and that Saint Ulrich was its abbot in 972. In the 11th century its discipline was on the decline, until Abbot Adalhalm (1082‚Äì94) introduced the Hirsau Reform. The same abbot began a restoration of the decaying buildings, which was completed along with the addition of a convent for noble ladies, by his successor, Abbot Rupert I (1102‚Äì45). Under the rule of the latter the newly founded Marienberg Abbey was recruited with monks from Ottobeuren. His successor, Abbot Isengrim (1145‚Äì80), wrote Annales minores Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores, XVII, 315 sq. and Annales majores.Monumenta Germaniae Historica: Scriptores, XVII, 312 sq.

Retrieved 2012-03-02. In 1153, and again in 1217, the abbey was consumed by fire. In the 14th and 15th centuries it declined so completely that at the accession of Abbot Johann Schedler (1416‚Äì43) only six or eight monks were left, and its annual revenues did not exceed 46 silver marks. Under Abbot Leonard Wiedemann (1508‚Äì46) it again began to flourish: he erected a printing establishment and a common house of studies for the Swabian Benedictines. The latter, however, was soon closed, owing to the ravages of the Thirty Years' War. Ottobeuren became an imperial abbey in 1299, but lost this status after the prince-bishop of Augsburg had become Vogt of the abbey. These rights were renounced after a court case at the Reichskammergericht in 1624. Within months of his election in 1710, the new abbot, Rupert Ness (Rupert II, 1710-1740), the son of a master blacksmith, succeeded in solving the centuries-old dispute over jurisdiction by paying 30,000 guldens to the prince-bishop of Augsburg for his renouncing the protection vogtei over the abbey, thus allowing Ottobeuren to regain its full status as an independent imperial abbey, although it did not become a member of the Swabian Circle. The War of the Spanish Succession not being yet over at the time, Abbot Rupert arranged to meet Emperor Charles VI who still occupied Bavaria, as well as Prince Eugene and the Duke of Marlborough who were operating in the area.http://www.sueddeutscher-barock.ch/In-Bauherr/h-r/Ottobeuren_Ness.html# Bird's eye view of the abbey in 1766 Abbot Rupert ushered in the most flourishing period in the history of Ottobeuren which lasted until its secularization in 1802. In the zenith of its glory, Ottobeuren fell victim to the German mediatization along with all the other imperial abbeys of the Holy Roman Empire. On 1 December 1802 Ottobeuren was secularized and its territory annexed to Bavaria.http://www.abtei- ottobeuren-1250.de/Zur_Geschichte_des_Klosters_2.html At the time, the territory of the imperial abbey covered 266 square kilometers and had about 10,000 inhabitants. =The abbey= From 1711-1725 Abbot Rupert erected the present monastery, the architectural grandeur of which has merited for it the name of \\"the Swabian Escorial\\", attesting to the economic significance of the abbey.

Second foundation Rococo interior of the basilica PAR NULLA FIGURA DOLORI In 1834 King Ludwig I of Bavaria restored it as a Benedictine priory, dependent on St. Stephen's Abbey, Augsburg. The priory had care of a large parish and an industrial school of sixty or seventy orphans whom the lay brothers instructed in various trades.\\"Succisa Verescit\\", The Downside Review, vol. 1, Downside Abbey., 1882, p. 114 It was granted the status of an independent abbey in 1918. As of 1910, the community consisted of five fathers, sixteen lay brothers, and one lay novice, who had under their charge the parish of Ottobeuren, a district school, and the industrial school for poor boys. Ottobeuren has been a member of the Bavarian Congregation of the Benedictine Confederation since 1893. Music Ottobeuren Abbey has one of the richest music programs in Bavaria, with concerts every Saturday. Most concerts feature one or more of the Abbey's famous organs. The old organ, the masterpiece of French organbuilder Karl Joseph Riepp (1710‚Äì75), is actually a double organ; it is one of the most treasured historic organs in Europe. It was the main instrument for 200 years, until 1957 when a third organ was added by G. F. Steinmeyer & Co, renovated and augmented in 2002 by Johannes Klais, making 100 stops available on five manuals (or keyboards).

In 1819, Louis Braille entered this school. Life Statue at the Institut national des jeunes aveugles Ha√ºy was born into a family of weavers. His father, a full-time loomer, also held the job of ringing the Angelus bells in a local Premonstrant Abbey. The abbey monks educated Valentin and he became a skilled linguist speaking ten different languages of the day. He also studied ancient Greek and Hebrew. In 1783, he gained the title \\"interpreter to the king\\", Louis XVI. In 1786, he was the interpreter of the King, to the Admiralty and the City Hall. He was a member of the Office of Writing. Ha√ºy's impulse to help the blind started in 1771, after he stopped for lunch in a cafe on the Place de la Concorde, Paris. There, he witnessed an ensemble of people from the Quinze-Vingts hospice for the blind being mocked during the religious street festival, \\"Saint Ovid's Fair\\". They were given dunce caps, oversized cardboard glasses and told to play their instruments which resulted in a cacophony of noises. He decided to found a school with Charles-Michel de l'√âp√©e. In May 1784, at Saint-Germain- des-Pr√©s, he met a young beggar, Fran√ßois Lesueur; he was his first student. He developed a method of raised letters, to teach Lesueur to read, and compose sentences. He made rapid progress, and Ha√ºy announced the success, in September 1784 in the Journal de Paris, then receiving encouragement from the French Academy of Sciences. With the help of the Philanthropic Society Ha√ºy founded the Institute for Blind Youth (Institution des jeunes aveugles), in February 1785.

It was launched in 1995 by Republican strategist Grover Norquist and then-House majority whip Tom DeLay. It has been criticized as being part of a \\"coziness\\" between the GOP and large corporations which has allegedly allowed business to rewrite government regulations affecting their own industries in some cases, such as with Dick Cheney's energy task force. Shortly after the 1994 elections which gave a majority of seats to Republican candidates, DeLay called prominent Washington lobbyists into his office. He had pulled the public records of political contributions that they made to Democrats and Republicans. According to Texans for Public Justice, \\"he reminded them that Republicans were in charge and their political giving had better reflect that --or else. The \\"or else\\" was a threat to cut off access to the Republican House leadership.\\"'But Tom DeLay was damaged goods long before that' Texans for Public Justice The project is named for K Street in Washington, D.C., where the largest lobbying firms once had their headquarters. Lobbyists are, in some circles, referred to as the \\"fourth branch of government,\\" as some have great influence in U.S. national politics due to their monetary resources and the \\"revolving-door\\" practice of hiring former government officials. Candidates seeking to succeed DeLay as House majority leader sought to distance themselves from the project, and as of January 15, 2006, all three announced candidates had vowed to dismantle it and overhaul the lobbying process. The fundamental quid pro quo at the center of the K Street Project -- the withholding of policy favors from interest groups and lobbying firms that hire Democrats -- is now illegal: the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, Sec 102, bans members of Congress and staffers from using their political power to influence the employment decision of any private entity \\"on the basis of partisan political affiliation\\". The dossier In 2002 the Washington Post reported on the existence of a dossier compiled by the project, keeping tabs on which lobbying firms and individual lobbyists gave to which politicians and parties. An unnamed GOP lobbyist source told the Washington Post that \\"you will have this list to control access\\" to the White House, Congress, and Federal agencies. According to the New York Times, Grover Norquist claimed \\"it's an ongoing project that's been updated over the last several years, and this is the most recent iteration.\\" Norquist claimed that the object was \\"letting people know how many R's and D's are being hired\\" by certain interest groups, so that these groups would hire more Republicans to represent them. As a result of this exposure, a letter circulated in Congress reminding members and Senators that it was a violation of ethical standards to limit lobbyists' access based on their political contributions. The Abramoff connection Members of Congress in both parties are promising to reform the rules for lobbying Congress in the aftermath of the Jack Abramoff lobbying and corruption scandal. Abramoff, a top Washington lobbyist, was a prolific contributor to Republican political campaigns, and has recently pleaded guilty to conspiracy and fraud charges. His campaign contributions, lavish golf trips, jobs that required little or no work, and expensive meals for congressmen and their staffers are the focus of a criminal investigation. Republicans distance themselves Former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, who served in the House before 1994, has often been described as the Senate liaison to the K Street Project, as he met with Norquist on a regular basis to review openings at lobbying firms and the leading candidates for those positions. As the Abramoff scandal broke and grew, however, he denied the extent of the role attributed to him. He claimed his meetings with Norquist were not as frequent as asserted, that he did not know Norquist that well, and that he was unaware of a file keeping track of campaign contributions by lobbyists and their firms. He took particular umbrage at claims to the contrary by then-Senate minority leader Harry Reid, saying they amounted to libel, although he did not deny that meetings took place. He referred to them as \\"good government\\" efforts. He claimed he had not seen Norquist in years, but later the blog Crooks and Liars posted a video clip of the two of them sharing a podium at a June 28, 2005 press conference. Norquist, however, claims that at a 2002 meeting with Santorum and lobbyists he described the project to them. A contemporary report says he described its goals and asked those present to help complete the project. He passed out a list of lobbyists the project was checking on. At that time Santorum did not comment. Later that year, Norquist publicly commented, \\"(Santorum) has gotten me in to talk to all those guys.\\" Santorum also had publicly criticized the Motion Picture Association of America and Boeing for hiring former Clinton Administration officials, but said that was unrelated to his meetings with Norquist. Roll Call also reported that Abramoff himself attended one of Santorum's meetings in 2001. Santorum says he might have attended but does not specifically recall that. After the disclosures, Santorum announced the jobs list would no longer be part of the meetings. Santorum lost his bid for re-election in 2006. Defenses of the K Street Project The few Republicans and political conservatives who have chosen to defend the project claim that after 40 years of a near-total Democratic control of Congress, most of the top lobbyists in Washington were former Democratic congressional staffers and aides, since lobbyists are valued for their access to power more than their political ideologies. They might be more loyal to their party and former employers than their present ones.Chuck Muth, 'In Defense of the K Street Project' http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=11787 In fact, Republicans claim, Democrats in Congress had informally done the same thing and forced lobbies to hire former staffers of their own. In this view, the K Street Project was simply a way of ensuring that those lobbying in Congress had political views in line with those who hired them to lobby. Labor unions, they noted, hire people to advocate for them in Washington who share their viewpoints regardless of their access to power.Chuck Muth, 'In Defense of the K Street Project' http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=11787 Trademark application On April 6, 2006, Norquist applied, through his organization Americans for Tax Reform, for trademark protection for the term \\"K Street Project.\\" When the story was reported the following week, he suggested it had been unfairly maligned by the media coverage of the scandal and that it was in fact simply a job-listing service. He promised to enforce it vigorously if it were approved, saying \\"We will sue anyone who says it wrong and make lots of money.\\" Democrats and liberals ridiculed the idea, with blogger Josh Marshall wondering if Norquist was trying to corner \\"exclusive rights to engage in organized corruption under this title in the environs of Washington, DC.\\" Others, like Jennifer Crider, spokeswoman for House minority leader Nancy Pelosi, accused Norquist of trying to keep the term from being associated with Republican corruption in an election year. However, it would take the application a year and a half, well after the election, to be approved at the Patent and Trademark Office's usual pace. Contrary to Norquist's public statements, his formal application requests trademark status only for the project's actual logo (see above).'Grover Norquist's \\"K Street Project\\" Trademark Request ' talking points memo However, on July 11, 2006, Norquist filed a second trademark application, this time seeking protection for the term \\"The K Street Project promotes the hire of lobbyists at corporations and trade associations who understand free-market economics, who support their principled positions for free trade, against tort law abuse, and for lower and more transparent taxation.\\" Footnotes References * VandeHei, Jim; June 10, 2002, GOP monitoring lobbyists' politics, The Washington Post. * Nicholas, Peter; August 12, 2002; Santorum sessions are a hot ticket, The Philadelphia Inquirer. * Sourcewatch entry on the K Street Project (accessed at 16:35 CST, on January 3, 2006, published under GNU FDL) * \\"Missouri Representative Says He Has Votes to Succeed DeLay\\", New York Times, January 14, 2006. * Marshall, Josh; April 11, 2006; ; talkingpointsmemo.com; retrieved April 14, 2006. * Grover Norquist's \\"K Street Project\\" Trademark Request at talkingpointsmemo.com; retrieved April 14, 2006. 04-06-2006 * Reston, Maeve, January 26, 2006; Santorum denies ties to 'K Street Project', Pittsburgh Post- Gazette. * Budoff, Carrie; January 27, 2006, Santorum jobs list is cut from meetings, Philadelphia Inquirer. * Muth, Chuck, January 23, 2006; In Defense of the K Street Project, Human Events. * Santorum and Norquist video: Thank You Grover, Crooks and Liars, retrieved January 27, 2006. * Sheffield, Carrie; April 12, 2006; Norquist seeks trademark on 'K Street Project'; The Hill; retrieved April 14, 2006.

It was also the first game from the company that had been confined to Japan since Kaitei Takara Sagashi in 1980. Gameplay Screenshot of the game The player must take control of the Chemic, a small black atom with red spikes which must adhere itself to passing Moleks (which come in four different colours: cyan, green, pink and yellow) in order to duplicate the patterns shown in the centre of the screen; if a Molek adheres itself to the Chemic incorrectly, the player must press the reject button to throw it away. The singular enemy in the game is the Atomic, a malevolent clump of balls which moves randomly around the screen, and will kill the Chemic if it merely touches it‚Äîhowever, the Chemic can counter-attack by adhering itself to a Power Molek (which are slightly larger than the regular Moleks, and first appear in the game's second world: once the Chemic has adhered itself to one, the adhered Moleks will spin around rapidly, and their speed will decrease to denote the nearing of the Power Molek's ending time limit). But the Atomic has a nasty habit of splitting up and reforming in order to cover more ground, and even the Power Moleks cannot match up to the Atomic's deadly Alpha- and Beta- Rays which can instantly cause them to float away (along with the regular Moleks) on contact; there are total of eighteen unique patterns which must be duplicated in the game, and every fourth stage is a \\"challenging stage\\" where the Chemic can fire yellow Moleks in four directions at the Atomic.

Freedom is to do and say what a person wishes but in a polite manner and without hurting others.\\"http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/03/25/203152.html In 2006 he demanded that the European Union, as well as the rest of the world, enact \\"a law that forbids the insult to religious figures and religious sacred opinions.\\" He has supported women's rights within Islamic sharia law and advocated for reforming traditional understanding of Islam. Al-Suwaidan is one of the signatories of A Common Word Between Us and You, an open letter by Islamic scholars to Christian leaders, calling for peace and understanding. Al-Suwaidan has condemned the 9/11 terrorists saying \\"these people are very dangerous to themselves, to the Arab world, to the Islamic world itself, and to Islam itself.\\" Al-Suwaidan is a strong supporter of women's rights in the Middle East and has participated in the Doha Debates arguing in favor of women's political and social rights. He spoke out against forced marriages calling it \\"un-Islamic.\\" Al-Suwaidan has also been a harsh critic of the US and the West and at conference of the Islamic Circle of North America in 2000, Al-Suwaidan said: \\"We must tell the West that we are extending a hand of peace now, but it will not be so for long.\\" \\"Even if a civilization is ready to crumble ‚Äì like the West, with all the characteristics of deterioration of past fallen empires ‚Äì it will not fall until we, the Muslims, strive to give it that last push, the last straw that will break the camel's back.http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/mixed-messages-from- touring-muslim-lecturer/story-e6frgcjx-1226386791743 At a meeting of the Islamic Association of Palestine in Chicago in 2000 Al-Suwiadan said \\"Palestine will not be liberated but through Jihad. Nothing can be achieved without sacrificing blood. The Jews will meet their end at our hands.\\" He was subsequently banned from the US.\\"Hardline cleric banned in the US will preach to British universities\\" Patrick Sawer; Philip Sherwell The Sunday Telegraph (London) 24 January 2010 Section: News; Pg. 8 In May 2007, Al-Suwaidan was listed by U.S. federal prosecutors, along with a group of U.S. Muslim Brotherhood members, as an unindicted co-conspirator in the terrorism financing case against the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development which was convicted along with its leaders of financing Hamas.http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/423.pdf A Federal court subsequently ruled that the list of unindicted co-conspirators should not have been released to the public. In an April 2012 interview for Al-Quds, a TV station affiliated with Hamas, he claimed that since politicians were controlled by money and the media which are controlled by the Jews, only \\"armed resistance\\" and not Western aid or Western popular sympathy could change the situation in Palestine and Jerusalem. He also said in the interview that the most dangerous thing facing Muslims is the Jews calling them \\"the greatest enemy.\\"\\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/mixed- messages-from-touring-muslim-lecturer/story-e6frgcjx-1226386791743 Al-Suwaidan subsequently denied charges of antisemitism stating, \\"We are not against the Jews, let this be very clear.\\" He alleged that the comments were based on a report by MEMRI which he called a \\"Zionist organization\\". In a sermon to Hamas which was later posted on the internet on 14 July 2014, Al-Suwaidan described Israel as \\"a deviant country...[that] is destined to be eradicated in its entirety,\\" explaining that \\"We do not demand a ceasefire. Rather, we demand that the rockets continue to be launched until they bow before us.\\" Al- Suwaidan further stated that: In November 2014, Al-Suwaidan was banned by the Belgium government from attending a Muslim Fair in Brussels on the basis of the comments made in this sermon. On his Twitter account, Al-Suwaidan wrote, \\"Under pressure from the Zionist Lobby, the Belgium government decided to prevent me from entering the country despite holding a valid visa.\\" He claims that the reason they denied him entry was his \\"candid position regarding Zionism and the barbaric crimes of the Israeli occupation\\". The Belgium government announced that it had decided to prevent Al-Suwaidan from visiting Brussels, because of his \\"anti-Semitic\\" remarks in the past. The Belgian Prime Minister and Interior Minister said \\"This preacher has unacceptable anti- Semitic beliefs and his presence here is a threat to public order.\\" Al- Suwaidan used his Twitter account to promote what he calls electronic Jihad. On 17 January 2012, Al Suwaidan tweeted: \\"I see the need in uniting the efforts of the hackers within the electronic jihad project against the Zionist enemy, and it is an effective and important jihad, and its reward is great ‚Äì Allah willing.\\" Al-Suwaidan: \\"I Strongly Encourage Young People To Undertake Electronic Jihad... I View This As Better Than 20 Jihad Operations.\\" In a 4 June 2011 interview on AlQuds TV, Al-Suwaidan called for armed resistance and electronic jihad against Israel: \\"The other day, I was asking myself: Why shouldn't I personally go on jihad? First of all, my body cannot tolerate it. Secondly, is what I am doing any less important than jihad? I would like us all to feel that we are in the same trench. There is such a thing as media jihad, political jihad, and a form of jihad that I strongly encourage young people to undertake ‚Äì electronic jihad. Some of our youth are extremely clever. I hope that a group of hackers will get together, and will wage resistance over the Internet, targeting Israeli and Zionist sites and destroying them electronically.‚Äù =Clashes with Arab States of the Persian Gulf= In November 2012 a UAE police official said that suspects arrested in UAE had met with Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood members who are the ‚Äòmentors of other groups‚Äô. He said \\"They hold courses and teach members how to act and resist, such as Tareq Al-Suwaidan. His anti-regime attitude is very clear.\\" In October 2013, Al-Suwaidan tweeted that he had been barred from performing the lesser Umrah pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, stating \\"I have been banned from entering Saudi Arabia solely for my views and my position against the coup in Egypt and I say that my love for Saudi Arabia and its people is unshaken and that ideas can [never] be banned.\\" Popularity  Al-Suwaidan has authored over 30 books, but his popularity is largely a result of his widespread social media activity‚Äì including: YouTube, Vimeo, iTunes, Facebook, Twitter. He has over 9 million followers on Twitter, as of 12 November 2017.

He studied at the University of Leiden. He \\"had early thoughts on the fundamental theorem of algebra\\" and gave the inductive definition for the Fibonacci numbers. He was the first to use the abbreviations 'sin', 'cos' and 'tan' for the trigonometric functions in a treatise. Girard was the first to state, in 1625, that each prime of the form 1 mod 4 is the sum of two squares. (See Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares.) It was said that he was quiet-natured and, unlike most mathematicians, did not keep a journal for his personal life. In the opinion of Charles Hutton, Girard was > ...the first person who understood the general doctrine of the formation of > the coefficients of the powers from the sum of the roots and their products. > He was the first who discovered the rules for summing the powers of the > roots of any equation. This had previously been given by Fran√ßois Vi√®te for positive roots, and is today called Vi√®te's formulas, but Vi√®te did not give these for general roots. In his paper, Funkhouser locates the work of Girard in the history of the study of equations using symmetric functions. In his work on the theory of equations, Lagrange cited Girard. Still later, in the nineteenth century, this work eventuated in the creation of group theory by Cauchy, Galois and others. Girard also showed how the area of a spherical triangle depends on its interior angles. The result is called Girard's theorem. He also was a lutenist and mentioned having written a treatise on music, though this was never published.

They are considered an important band in the new wave of British heavy metal movement. Early years The original line-up was completed by former Hunter members Les Hunt (lead guitar), Chris Ellis (bass guitar), and John Wright (drums). The band were signed by Mike Stone's Clay Records in 1980 and licensed to Carrere Records to join their stable of metal bands. Their debut album, Night of the Demon, was released in 1981. After their 1982 follow-up album, The Unexpected Guest, the band experimented beyond the NWOBHM sound and moved the band in a more melodic direction whilst still retaining the more traditional heavy metal black magic lyrical style. In 1983, Demon took a change in direction. The Plague marked a swing towards a more progressive sound, adding the keyboards of session musician Andy Richards to the album's sound. Lyrically the band also changed direction, switching to a more overtly political style that was to characterise their albums for the rest of their career. The following album, Pink Floyd influenced British Standard Approved (1984), released on the small independent Clay label, was not a huge commercial success, and with the death of Mal Spooner later that year, it appeared that the band would soon fold. At this point, the band had recruited a permanent keyboard player and co-songwriter in Steven Watts. 1985‚Äì1992 The following release Heart of Our Time (1985) showed that the remaining members of the band were determined to continue, and it was the start of a new songwriting partnership between Hill and Watts. Although the album is regarded as the weakest of the band's releases, it paved the way for the critically acclaimed Breakout (1987) and its follow-up Taking the World by Storm (1989). The band would go on to release two more albums in the 1990s: 1991's Hold onto the Dream and 1992's Blow Out, before splitting up in 1992 which, according to singer and founding member Dave Hill, was because of fatigue. Reunion 2001‚Äìpresent Hill reunited the band with new members in 2001, and released a new album called Spaced Out Monkey. The band has since gone onto release a further three albums: Better the Devil You Know (2005), Unbroken (2012) and their latest release Cemetery Junction, which was released on 28 October 2016. All of the band's post-reunion releases have received positive reviews from the press, leading the band to go on and play many festivals across Europe - including the Bang Your Head festival and Sweden Rock Festival - but to rarely embark upon full tours. The band toured with Magnum singer Bob Catley in 2005, and in 2018 celebrated the 35th anniversary of The Unexpected Guest by touring the UK, playing all of the songs from the album, plus some other classics.

He created the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) long-running Media Watch program, which he hosted from its inception in 1989 to 1997.  Media career  Littlemore was educated at Scots College, and later studied law at the University of New South Wales, winning the Australian Law Students' Association Championship Moot in 1978. His broadcasting experience began in the late 1960s when he worked as a television current affairs journalist for the BBC in London, and then the ABC, firstly on This Day Tonight and then on Four Corners. Having established his legal career, Littlemore created in 1989 for the ABC the media commentary program Media Watch which he presented for a further eight years. His motivation was \\"I want to show people the problems ‚Äì not tell them. The program will be contentious. I hope. And idiosyncratic.\\"https://aso.gov.au/titles/tv/media-watch- series-9-episode-1/notes/ He published a book about his media experiences entitled The Media and Me in 1996. Following Media Watch, he had a short- running discussion program, Littlemore (2001), which, like the former program, examined issues about the media. Littlemore has made a few film and television appearances, playing a reporter in the 1978 film Money Movers and in the 1983 TV series The Dismissal. He made guest appearances on the 1990s comedy series Frontline, playing himself in his role as Media Watch host.

As a lawyer, Littlemore has spoken publicly about how he feels it is a professional challenge to knowingly get the guilty acquitted at trial. In an interview in October 1995 on Channel 7 when asked by host Andrew Denton if he could defend \\"someone who you yourself believe not to be innocent\\", Littlemore's response was \\"Well, they're the best cases. I mean, you really feel you've done something when you get the guilty off. Anyone can get an innocent person off. I mean, they shouldn't be on trial. But the guilty ‚Äì that's the challenge.\\" Littlemore represented Mercedes Corby, the sister of Schapelle Corby, in her defamation action against Australian television broadcaster the Seven Network which was decided in her favour. He also represented Pauline Hanson in her defamation action against News Ltd., after The Sun-Herald and The Sunday Telegraph published (and later retracted) nude photographs that they claimed showed a young Ms Hanson. A settlement was reached between the parties out of court. In 2012, Littlemore represented former NSW Labor politician Eddie Obeid in hearings before the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

M. n. Maximus Gurges, the son of Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, was consul in 292, 276, and 265 BC. After a dissolute youth and a significant military defeat during his first consulate, he was given the opportunity to salvage his reputation through the influence of his father, and became a successful general, eventually holding the highest honours of the Roman state. He was slain in battle during his third and final consulate.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 992, 993 (Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges).Broughton, vol. I, pp. 181‚Äì183, 195, 201, 202. Background and early career Gurges' grandfather, Marcus Fabius Ambustus, had been consul three times, interrex twice, and reportedly was princeps senatus, a dignity later filled by his son, grandson, and great- grandson. He had probably been censor, which was generally a prerequisite of those who became princeps senatus, and either he or his son, Marcus was magister equitum in 322 BC. Gurges' father, Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, was one of Rome's most celebrated generals, and had been consul five times between 322 and 297 BC. In his time he had served as both dictator and magister equitum, and was censor in 304. However, all of his accomplishments followed from a rash incident in his youth, when as magister equitum to the dictator Lucius Papirius Cursor in 325, during the Second Samnite War, he engaged the enemy against the dictator's instructions while Papirius was away attending to other business. Although Rullianus won a significant victory, his commander was furious that his orders had been disobeyed. Fabius only escaped execution by fleeing to Rome, where he begged the intercession of the people, and was saved by the appeal of his aged father.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, pp. 991, 992 (Quintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus). The younger Fabius received his surname, Gurges, \\"the glutton\\", on account of the habits of his own youth, in which he enjoyed every luxury.Macrobius, Saturnalia, ii. 9. But when he embarked on a public career, the younger Fabius set aside his indulgent lifestyle and cultivated a more sober image. As curule aedile in 295 BC, Fabius levied fines against wealthy Roman matrons who had been convicted of adultery, and dedicated the funds to building a temple of Venus, which stood near the Circus Maximus.Livy, x. 31. Consulships and later career In 292 BC, Fabius was consul for the first time, with Decimus Junius Brutus Scaeva. Rome was engaged in the Third and final Samnite War, and Fabius undertook a command against the Pentri, the leading tribe of the Samnites, in which he was utterly defeated. At Rome, the traditional rivals of the Fabii, the Papirii and the Claudii, urged that Fabius be relieved of his authority and degraded from consular rank as a punishment for his incompetence. In opposition to this, Fabius' father, Rullianus, urged that his son be permitted to redeem himself, volunteering to serve personally as his son's lieutenant on a subsequent campaign. Thus spared public humiliation, Fabius made good on his father's word, defeating the Samnites, taking several towns, and capturing Pontius, the Samnite general. In recognition of his victories, the senate honoured Fabius with a triumph; the occasion was the more remarkable because the elder Fabius rode beside his son's chariot.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Fabius Maximus\\", 24. Fabius continued in command against the Samnites as proconsul in 291, and was besieging the town of Cominium, when the consul Lucius Postumius Megellus assumed command of the siege, and ordered Fabius to withdraw from Samnium.Dionysius, xvi. 16. Fabius was consul for the second time in 276 BC, with Gaius Genucius Clepsina. Fabius led an army into southern Italy, where he defeated the Samnites, Lucani, and Bruttii, receiving a second triumph. Rome suffered a particularly difficult pestilence this year.Orosius, iv. 2. In 273, Fabius led a delegation of ambassadors to the court of Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt. He was accompanied by his cousin, Numerius Fabius Pictor, and Quintus Ogulnius Gallus, each of whom would later hold the consulship. On their departure for Rome, Ptolemy presented the ambassadors with rich gifts, which they subsequently deposited in the Roman treasury. However, as a gesture of gratitude and respect, the Roman Senate decreed that the gifts be returned to the ambassadors.Dionysius, xx. 4.Valerius Maximus, iv. 3. ¬ß 10. Consul for the third time in 265 BC, with Lucius Mamilius Vitulus, Fabius was sent to aid the elders of Volsinii during a revolt of that city's plebeians against the aristocracy. Fabius was wounded in fierce fighting, and subsequently died. In the same year, his son, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, who would go on to become consul five times, and twice dictator, was consecrated an augur. At an uncertain time before his death, Fabius was named princeps senatus, a position of honour that had previously been held by his father and grandfather, and which would later be bestowed upon his son.Pliny, vii. 41. Historical uncertainty Although Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges has traditionally been identified as the father of Verrucosus, a minority view espoused by Beloch and Degrassi holds that Verrucosus was the grandson of Gurges, consul in 292 and 276, and that his father, also named Quintus Fabius Maximus Gurges, was the consul of 265 BC.Beloch, R√∂mische Geschicte, p. 458, note 1. Passages in Plutarch and Pliny describe Verrucosus as the great-grandson of Rullianus, although they do not explicitly state that he was the grandson of Gurges, the consul of 292 and 276.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Fabius Maximus\\", 13, 24.Pliny, vii. 33. In Broughton's opinion, the interval of fifty-nine years between Gurges' first consulship in 292, and Verrucosus' first, in 233, supports this view, although Livy describes Verrucosus as the grandson of Rullianus, and by implication, the son of Gurges.Livy, xxx. 26. The Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology agrees that Verrucosus was likely the grandson, not the son of Gurges, but supposes that his father might have been the Quintus Fabius who, as curule aedile in 266 BC, insulted the envoys of Apollonia in Epirus, and was given over to that city for punishment, only to be returned unharmed by the people of Apollonia.Livy, Epitome xv.Valerius Maximus, vi. 6. ¬ß 5.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. II, p. 993 (Q. Fabius Maximus, no. 3). In this case, the consul of 265 would be the same Gurges who had previously been consul in 292 and 276.

Cultural and official perceptions and definitions of the various regions differ somewhat depending on the government agency or popular group by which they are being applied.  Overview  Various Queensland state government departments adopt different definitions of regions for administrative purposes. The Queensland government Trade and Investment Queensland defines seven regions. These are (roughly from south to north). * South East Queensland * Darling Downs South West * Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett * Central Queensland * Mackay, Isaac and Whitsunday * Northern * Far North Smaller regions may also exist within these defined regions, such as the Torres Strait Islands, Whitsunday Islands and South West Queensland.  South East Queensland  Brisbane is the largest city in both the South East Queensland region and the state of Queensland. The Gold Coast South East Queensland is commonly considered to be a single region. It contains two statistical regions listed above, Brisbane and Moreton. The region has a population of 3,500,000 people, or 72% of the state's population. The area contains Brisbane, the state's capital city, as well as the Logan City, Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Ipswich and the Lockyer Valley. The region is the major administrative and commercial centre and focus of tourism within Queensland. The Brisbane region comprises the greater Brisbane metropolitan area, centred on the City of Brisbane and also including the Logan, Redland, Moreton Bay and Ipswich local government areas. The metropolitan area has a population of 2,360,241 (2016) It is the state's main commercial and administrative centre and contains the state's largest domestic and international airport. The Gold and Sunshine Coasts, located south and north of Brisbane respectively, are two of the Queensland's most popular tourist regions, containing many hotels and resorts. Each region has an airport which caters primarily to tourists. The remaining parts of the region are located inland, west of Brisbane, and are primarily rural.  Darling Downs South West  The Darling Downs South West region is located about west of Brisbane and borders the states of New South Wales and South Australia. The region consists of the fertile agricultural area west of the Great Dividing Range and south to the New South Wales state border, centred on the city of Toowoomba. It has an area of and contains the local government areas of Toowoomba, Goondiwindi, Southern Downs, Western Downs, Maranoa, Balonne, Bulloo, Murweh, Paroo and Quilpie. In 2008, the region had a population of 257,749. Economic activities include cattle grazing, cotton farming, and natural resource extraction such as natural gas and opal mining. Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett  Hervey Bay is part of the Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett region The Wide Bay‚ÄìBurnett region is located north-east of the Darling Downs and north of the Sunshine Coast, covering a region of . It consists of the Bundaberg, Fraser Coast, Gympie, North Burnett and South Burnett local government areas. Major centres include Bundaberg, Gympie, Hervey Bay, Kingaroy and Maryborough. The area is rich in sugar cane farms and mills and has a significant tourism industry ‚Äì it includes Fraser Island, a popular tourist destination and world's largest sand island. Its population in 2008 was 276,752. Central Queensland The Central Queensland region borders South Australia and the Northern Territory, and contains the major centres of Rockhampton and Gladstone, the coastal areas and popular holiday destinations Yeppoon, Agnes Water and 1770, and well as the areas further west of the Barcaldine, Barcoo, Blackall-Tambo, Boulia, Diamantina, Longreach and Winton local government areas. Despite its vast land area of , it only had a population of 200,172 (2008). The region's economy is heavily dominated by coal mining, and cattle grazing. A major aluminium smelter is located in Gladstone. =Mackay, Isaac & Whitsunday= The Mackay, Isaac & Whitsunday region is centred on the coastal city of Mackay and extends some 300 km inland. It contains the Whitsunday Islands group and the coastal towns of Proserpine, Bowen and Sarina. The coastal areas are densely covered in sugar cane farms, while the less densely populated inland areas have several mining communities.  North Queensland  The North Queensland region is a coastal region centered on the city of Townsville and secondary inland city of Mount Isa. Townsville is the location of a major seaport handling exports from mines in Mount Isa and cattle exports from coastal and inland areas. The region also contains a bulk sugar exporting terminal at Lucinda in the region's north. Other inland towns include Charters Towers and Cloncurry, and the coastal towns of Ayr, Home Hill and Ingham. Far North Tropical rainforests and beaches on Hinchinbrook Island The Far North region is Queensland's largest region covering 22% of the state's area and includes Cape York Peninsula, the Torres Strait, and at the Gulf of Carpentaria. The main population and administrative centre of the region is located in Cairns. Other key population centres include Cooktown, the Atherton Tableland, Weipa, Normanton, and Thursday Island. The region also consists of many Aboriginal and farming communities. The region covers an area of and in 2012 the region's population was 301,256 of which 146,778 lived in Cairns. Significant industries include tourism, cattle grazing, agriculture (sugar cane and tropical fruits) and mining of both sand and bauxite. Lawn Hill Gorge in Boodjamulla National Park  Other definitions  Other names for regions are in popular usage, for example by different government agencies and in various regional maps of Queensland. The state also contains smaller regions within those discussed above which are not necessarily used for statistical purposes, but which are distinct in terms of their geography, economy or demographic characteristics. Such regions in Queensland include: * Tropical Queensland ‚Äì the area of the state north of latitude 23.5 degrees South. * Tropical North Queensland ‚Äì an area of tropical Queensland that usually includes Far North Queensland, and sometimes also North Queensland. * The Outback ‚Äì refers generally to Australian arid inland regions. * Whitsunday Islands ‚Äì a group of islands in the Mackay region. A popular tourist destination, the name usually includes the coastal community of Airlie Beach, and sometimes also Proserpine. * Torres Strait Islands ‚Äì islands between the northern tip of Queensland and Papua New Guinea * Atherton Tableland ‚Äì a fertile agricultural district in the Cairns hinterland, Far North Queensland. * Granite Belt ‚Äì an area of south-east Queensland centred on the town of Stanthorpe. * Border Rivers ‚Äì an area near the border of New South Wales and Queensland. * Capricorn Coast ‚Äì a section of the Central Queensland coastline near the Tropic of Capricorn. * Maranoa ‚Äì a district that is sometimes referred to as the Western Darling Downs, in South West Queensland. * The Marlin Coast ‚Äì a coastal area centered on Cairns. * North West Queensland ‚Äì the area around Mt Isa.

He was nominated for Oscar and Palme d'Or awards, and won Locarno International Film Festival, Edgar Allan Poe Awards, French Legion of Honor, Golden Globe Award, French National Academy of Cinema and Honorary Cesar awards. According to one obituary: > For exactly 40 years, the prolific Verneuil made movies as mainstream and > commercial as any to be found in America or Britain. In his best period ‚Äì > the 1950s and 1960s ‚Äì he delivered films in the \\"tradition of quality\\" so > despised by the Nouvelle Vague. Many of them proved excellent vehicles for > old-timers Jean Gabin and Fernandel, and newcomers such as Jean-Paul > Belmondo and Alain Delon. Life and career =Early life= Verneuil was born Ashot Malakian () to Armenian parents in Rodosto, East Thrace, Turkey. In 1924, when Ashot was a little child his family fled to Marseille in France, to escape persecution after the Armenian Genocide. He later recounted his childhood experience in the novel Mayrig, which he dedicated to his mother and made into a 1991 film with the same name, which was followed by a sequel, 588 Rue Paradis, the following year. Verneuil entered the √âcole Nationale d'Arts et Metiers in Aix- en-Provence in 1942. After graduation, he worked as a journalist, then became editor of Horizon Armenian magazine. =Film career= In 1947, Verneuil managed to convince the established European film actor Fernandel to appear in his first film. In 1951 he directed his first feature, the black comedy La Table aux crev√©s. His second film, Forbidden Fruit (1952), based on a Georges Simenon novel, was even more acclaimed. Later he also directed other movie stars including Jean Gabin, Alain Delon, Lino Ventura (all together acting for him in \\"Le clan des siciliens\\" in 1969), Jean-Paul Belmondo (\\"Le Corps de mon ennemi\\" in 1976 and other films), Omar Sharif, Claudia Cardinale (Mayrig), Yves Montand and Mich√®le Morgan. Verneuil has filmed almost all the great figures of French cinema, with the exception of Bourvil, as even Louis de Fun√®s has a small role in one of his films. After the American experience (he was called the \\"most American of French directors\\"), in 1969 Verneuil \\"found\\" France. He was awarded a C√©sar in 1996 and he was elected a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in 2000. He died at Bagnolet, a suburb of Paris, in 2002. The opening of the seventh annual Golden Apricot International Film Festival in Yerevan paid tribute to Verneuil. His son, television director Patrick Malakian, who reclaimed the name of his historical ancestors, received the posthumous award, the Parajanov's Thaler, for his father's contribution to cinema.

Its core membership is made up of 339 English councils and the 22 Welsh councils through the Welsh Local Government Association. The LGA is politically led and cross-party. As the national voice of local government, it works on behalf of councils to give local government a strong, credible voice with national government, to promote the positive reputation of the sector and to secure funding and powers on behalf of councils and the communities they serve. Through its programme of practical peer-based support it helps councils continuously to improve and innovate and it co-ordinates collective legal actions on behalf of the sector. The LGA also provides membership services to other organisations through an associate scheme, including fire and rescue authorities, national parks authorities, town councils, police & crime commissioners and elected mayors of combined authorities. The Chairman of the LGA is Cllr James Jamieson and the Chief Executive is Mark Lloyd. History On 1 April 1997, the Association of County Councils, the Association of District Councils and the Association of Metropolitan Authorities came together to form a single membership body for local government in England ‚Äì the Local Government Association (LGA). In 2010, the LGA merged with the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA), Local Government Employers (LGE), Local Authority Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services (LACORS) and the Leadership Centre for Local Government. The IDeA, whilst wholly owned by the LGA, continues to exist as a company and the recipient of central government grant for improvement activities. The Leadership Centre is now an independent body based in North London. In April 2019, the former unincorporated LGA was replaced by the LGA unlimited company , enabling it to hold title to its two properties ‚Äì its headquarters in Smith Square, Westminster and the former IDeA headquarters in Farringdon. The LGA‚Äôs annual meeting ‚Äì the General Assembly - takes place on the first Tuesday of July each year. The 2019 Assembly passed a motion declaring a climate emergency and calling on government to explore the domestic implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through funded partnership roles with local authority areas and encouraging councils to continue to link local priorities with the overall ambitions of the SDGs.

It is a Geological Conservation Review site. Aston Rowant Cutting, also known as the Stokenchurch Gap or Aston Hill cutting, or locally \\"The Canyon\\" is a steep chalk cutting, constructed through the Chiltern Hills on the border between Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire, England during the early 1970s for the M40 motorway. It is long and a maximum of deep, and is located approximately from High Wycombe and close to the village of Stokenchurch. Despite the names, the cutting is in the parish of Lewknor rather than Aston Rowant or Stokenchurch. The cutting provides the best exposure in central England dating to the Coniacian stage of the Late Cretaceous, approximately 88 million years ago. It is part of the Upper Chalk succession, and at its base there is a fossil rich section which is important in defining the boundary between the Coniacian and the preceding Turonian stage. Red kites are commonly seen flying within the cutting or on the surrounding downland, making their return after their persecution by game keepers in Victorian times following a successful reintroduction programme organised by the RSPB and Natural England,Conservation: Red kite.

They are widespread and even locally common in Tasmania. They have been considered extinct on the mainland since the 1960s, however have been reintroduced back into fenced sanctuaries in 2016, and more recently into the wild in March 2018. It is one of six extant species of quolls.  Taxonomy  The eastern quoll is a member of the family Dasyuridae, which includes most carnivorous marsupials. Its species name, viverrinus, indicates it is \\"ferret- like\\". There are no recognised subspecies.  Description  A fawn-coloured form of the eastern quoll photographed in Tasmania Eastern quolls are generally about the size of a small domestic cat, with adult males measuring in total length, including the tail, and having an average weight of . Females are significantly smaller, measuring , including a tail, and weighing around . They have a tapering snout, short legs, and erect ears. They can be distinguished from all other species of quoll by the presence of only four toes, rather than five, on the hind feet, lacking the hallux. They have a thick coat covered by white spots, that can be either light fawn or near black, with off-white underparts stretching from the chin to the underside of the tail. Both fawn and black individuals can be born in the same litter, although in surviving populations the former represent about three times more common than the latter. The spots are in diameter, and are found across the upper body and flanks, from the top of the head to the rump, but, unlike some other species of quoll, do not extend onto the tail. Females possess a relatively shallow fur-lined pouch formed by lateral folds of skin. The pouch becomes enlarged during the breeding season, and includes six to eight teats, which only become elongated and functional if one of the young attaches to them, regressing again after they leave the pouch. As with all quolls, the penis of the male bears an unusual fleshy appendage. The large intestine of eastern quolls is relatively simple, having no caecum, and not being divided into a colon and rectum. An unusual feature of eastern quolls is the presence of an opening connecting the ventricles of the heart in newborn young, in addition to that connecting the atria found in all marsupials. Both openings close after a few days.  Distribution and habitat  The eastern quoll was formerly found across much of southeastern mainland Australia, from the eastern coasts of South Australia, through most of Victoria, to the mid-north coast of New South Wales. The species was formerly abundant around Adelaide, particularly the Adelaide Hills, with a 1923 newspaper article noting its rapid decline and presumed extinction in the area during the preceding ten years. It likely became functionally extinct in the early 1960s on mainland Australia, but remains widespread in Tasmania, and is also found today on Bruny Island. Within Tasmania, eastern quolls inhabit rainforest, heathland, alpine areas, and scrub below . However, they prefer dry grassland and forest mosaics, bounded by agricultural land, particularly where pasture grubs are common.  Behaviour  The eastern quoll is a solitary predator, hunting at night for its prey of insects, small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They have been known to scavenge food from the much larger Tasmanian devil. Although the majority of their diet consists of meat, they also eat some vegetable matter, including fruit during the summer, and grass year-round. The eastern quoll is itself prey for Tasmanian devils and masked owls. Eastern quolls are nocturnal, and spend the day resting in burrows, although they may also use natural rock crevices or hollow tree trunks. The burrows often consist of no more than a simple, blind-ending tunnel, but are sometimes more complex, including one or more nesting chambers lined with grass. Each individual has a number of dens, usually no more than five, which it alternates between on different days. Eastern quolls are solitary, and tend to avoid one another, although pairs of adult females are sometimes encountered. Home ranges are typically around for females, and for males, with the latter increasing dramatically during the breeding season. Territories are scent marked, although dung is distributed randomly, rather than placed at specific latrines. Adults also warn off intruders by hissing and making coughing sounds, and also make a sharp shriek that may be an alarm call. If intruders fail to leave quickly, then aggressive action escalates to chasing and wrestling with jaws while standing on their hind legs. Mothers and young also have softer calls that are used to maintain contact. Reproduction The breeding season begins in early winter. The oestrus cycle lasts 34 days, although most individuals mate during their first cycle of the year. The female gives birth up to twenty young\\"Mammals\\" Dorling Kindersley Limited, London after a gestation period of 19 to 24 days. Of these, the first to attach themselves to the available teats will be the only survivors. The young remain attached to the teat for 60 to 65 days, begin to develop fur at around 51 days, open their eyes at about 79 days, and are fully weaned at 150 to 165 days. They reach sexual maturity in their first year, and can live for up to seven years in captivity.  Conservation  A black eastern quoll photographed in Tasmania The eastern quoll likely became extinct on mainland Australia due to disease and predation by introduced predators (red fox and feral cat). The lack of foxes in Tasmania likely has contributed to the survival of the species there; however, unseasonal weather events and predation by feral cats are thought to have contributed to a possible recent decline in the Tasmanian population. The species is currently classified as Endangered by the IUCN. The last mainland eastern quoll specimen was collected as roadkill in Sydney's Nielsen Park, Vaucluse on 31 January 1963. however a taxidermied specimen provided to NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service in 2016 was reported to have been collected in 1989 or 1990 in the Gloucester region of NSW, indicating the species may have survived longer than the generally accepted 1960's decade of its mainland extinction. The NSW National Parks and Wildlife service reported numerous unconfirmed sightings until 1999 (the year of the report), and the species was reported sighted as recently as 2006; however, these sightings may have been of a similarly patterned quoll, the spotted-tailed quoll (Dasyurus maculatus). Specimens collected in 2005 and 2008 west of Melbourne, Victoria, are likely connected with a nearby wildlife sanctuary, either as direct escapees, or the descendants of escapees from that facility. In March 2016, a small population of 16 was reintroduced to the mainland in Mulligans Flat Woodland Sanctuary in Canberra. A second reintroduction to the same protected reserve took place in 2017, where the population grew after breeding season to approximately 40. In March 2018, a pilot trial of 20 eastern quolls from Tasmania were released into a national park on the south coast of NSW. Wildlife authorities said the animals would be closely monitored, to identify threats and determine how best to manage these threats, prior to a proposed full reintroduction in 2019.

Early in the 1490s, he had to recognise the independence of his rival rulers of Imereti and Kakheti, and to confine his power to Kartli. In 1505, Constantine II died, and was succeeded by his son David X. Life Royal charter of King Constantine II. Constantine II was the son of Prince Demetrius. In 1465, together with his uncle, the Georgian king George VIII, Constantine was taken prisoner by the rebel prince Qvarqvare II Jaqeli, atabeg of Samtskhe (principality in southern Georgia). He managed, however, to escape the captivity, and taking opportunity of the Imeretian king Bagrat VI‚Äôs absence at the campaign in Kartli, vainly attempted to seize control of the Imeretian capital Kutaisi. Despite the failure, he considered himself king and later won some power in Kartli. However, only with Bagrat‚Äôs death in 1478 was Constantine able to drive out Bagrat‚Äôs son, Alexander II, and become king of Georgia, though already fragmentised and torn apart with the bitter civil wars. In 1483, he was defeated by Qvarqvare II of Samtskhe at the Battle of Aradeti. Alexander took advantage and established himself in Imereti but lost Kutaisi to Constantine again in 1484. In the winter of 1488, the Ak Koyunlu Turkomans led by Halil Bey attacked Georgia‚Äôs capital Tbilisi, and took the city after a long-lasted siege in February 1489. Though the foreign occupation of the capital did not last long, the situation was immediately exploited by Alexander who seized control of Kutaisi and the rest of Imereti. From 1490 to 1493, Constantine was compelled to de jure recognise his cousin Alexander I of Kakheti and Alexander II of Imereti as independent sovereigns and to grant Qvarqvare II significant autonomy. Constantine himself was left with Kartli as the extent of his kingdom. Thus, by the end of the 15th century, Georgia was divided into three independent kingdoms (Kartli, Kakheti, and Imereti) and five autonomous principalities (Samtskhe, Mingrelia, Guria, Abkhazia, and Svaneti). Between 1492-1496, Constantine attempted to win an international support to reunite the country and defend it against the increasingly aggressive Muslim empires of Ottoman Turkey and Safavid Iran. For this purpose, Georgian ambassadors were sent to the Burji sultan of Egypt Qaitbay, and also to Pope Alexander VI and Isabella I of Castile. The embassies, however, proved to be fruitless. Upon the death of Qvargvare II's son Kaikhosro I, only two years after he ascended the throne of the Samtskhe principality, he was succeeded by his equally \\"pious\\" brother Mzechabuk. At the same time, the Iranian Safavids, led by the emerging king (shah) Ismail I were tempted to loot the feudal state, if only to distract himself from his main quarry; Shirvan. In the same year, in 1500, Ismail I baited Constantine as well as king Alexander II of Imereti to attack Ottoman possessions located nearby Tabriz. As a precaution, Ismail had Aleksander send his son Demetre to the newly conquered region of Shirvan, where the prince negotiated a peace agreement. Ismail promised Constantine, that once Tabriz was captured, he would cancel the tribute Constantine still paid to the Ak Koyunlu Turcomans. Each Georgian ruler contributed 3,000 men to the existing Ismail's own 7,000, and by 1503 they enabled him to recapture Nakhchivan from the Ottomans. However, Ismail I broke his promise, and made Kartli and Kakheti his vassals. =Death= Constantine II died in 1505, leaving the throne to his son, David X. As indicated by surviving church records, he might have abdicated the throne and retired to monastery under the name of Cyril in 1503 or 1504. Marriage and children Constantine II married in 1473 Tamar (died c. 1492).

Apostolof (February 25, 1928 ‚Äì August 14, 2005), sometimes credited under aliases A.C. Stephen(s) or Robert Lee, was a Bulgarian-American filmmaker specializing in low-budget exploitation and erotic films, who gained a cult following for a wide variety of films that range from erotic horror (Orgy of the Dead) and suburban expos√© (Suburbia Confidential) to western- themed costume pictures (Lady Godiva Rides) and Mission Impossible-type capers such as (Hot Ice). Apostolof had gained a reputation for creating high-quality mass entertainment with minimal budgets. He was also one of the few directors to work steadily with the infamous Ed Wood and such sexploitation icons as Marsha Jordan and Rene Bond in the 1960s and 1970s. Early life Apostolof was born in the Black Sea town of Burgas, Bulgaria, to Hristo Apostolov, a can manufacturer, and his wife Polyxena. Apostolof had a brother, Stavri, and two sisters, Vesa and Lila. The Apostolofs were an artistically inclined family. Steven attended a German-language high school for several years. In 1946, when he was only 17, he joined an underground guerilla group that fought the newly established Communist regime in Bulgaria. He was eventually arrested and spent 18 months in jail. In 1948, he escaped from Bulgaria by stowing away on a Finnish freighter. He was caught in Turkish territorial waters and thrown in jail for several months, accused of being a Bulgarian spy. After a short stay in Istanbul he drifted to Paris, France. After serving in the French Foreign Legion, in 1950 he moved, this time to Canada, and from there in 1952 he went to Los Angeles, California, where he became a clerk for Bank of America. Career =1950s= Apostolof's career in films began at 20th Century-Fox, where he was doing some number-crunching in the production department in 1953‚Äì1954., Who's who in the West: a biographical dictionary of noteworthy men and women of the Pacific coast and the Western States. Journey to Freedom (1957) Around 1955, Apostolof teamed up with exploitation veterans Robert C. Dertano and William C. Thompson to create SCA Productions, a company that produced the semi-autobiographical Cold War melodrama Journey to Freedom (1957). The film starred Tor Johnson, the Swedish wrestler best known for appearing in Edward D. Wood Jr.'s movies Bride of the Monster (1954), Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959) and Night of the Ghouls (1959). Journey to Freedom was shot in the legendary Sunset Gower Studios and later picked up for distribution by Republic Pictures, known for its quality B-movies and westerns, many of them starring John Wayne. Although not very popular at the time, Journey to Freedom became part of the so-called Red Scare, a period of intense anti-Communism that had already produced propaganda films like I Married a Communist (1949), The Red Menace (1949) and Big Jim McLain (1952). Journey to Freedom tells about Apostolof's escape from Communist Bulgaria through Istanbul, Paris and Toronto to Los Angeles, California. =1960s= In the mid-'60s Apostolof became involved in sexploitation cinema, adopting the less foreign-sounding \\"A.C. Stephen\\" as a nom de plume. Apostolof cites Russ Meyer's The Immoral Mr. Teas (1959), the first nudie-cutie, as a major influence in his sexploitation-oriented career. He said, \\"I saw what was happening in the market‚ÄîI couldn't possibly compete with the major companies, but I saw a niche there for us, the independent guys. I saw those sexy type of pictures that were becoming popular. I went and saw them and I wanted to see how far you could go with nudity.\\" Over the next two decades Apostolof made 16 films with a trademark blend of tasteful nudity and campy humour. Orgy of the Dead (1965) Orgy of the Dead, Apostolof's first directorial credit as A.C. Stephen with a screenplay by Ed Wood, is now considered a camp classic and has inspired a cult following. It features the legendary oracle The Amazing Criswell (known from Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space) and burlesque queen Pat Barrington (later to star in Harry H. Novak's The Agony of Love). Wood served as writer, production manager, casting agent, and even held up cue cards for Criswell, although he did not direct. Orgy of the Dead was the beginning of a very successful partnership between Apostolof and Wood that would last until the latter's death in 1978. This cooperation resulted in several films that captured the zeitgeist of the late 1960s and the 1970s. Suburbia Confidential (1966) Apostolof's next film, Suburbia Confidential, uses psychiatry largely to set up sex scenes but also to give the film some semblance of \\"redeeming social value\\". According to the promotional materials, the film \\"starts where the Kinsey report left off\\". In Suburbia Confidential psychiatrist Dr. Henri Legrand reviews the files of several sexually frustrated suburban housewives who are shown having sex with salesmen, bellboys and repairmen. The film includes scenes of bondage, lesbianism and a transvestite based on Apostolof's frequent collaborator Ed Wood. Suburbia Confidential is the first in a series of three films made by Apostolof in the late 1960s dealing with the \\"confidential\\" sexual life of different groups of people, the other two being Motel Confidential and College Girl Confidential. The Bachelor's Dreams (1967) Office Love-in, White-Collar Style (1968) College Girl Confidential (1968) Apostolof was busy in 1968, with College Girl Confidential and Office Love-in, White-Collar Style. Office Love -in, White-Collar Style features voluptuous sexploitation icon Marsha Jordan and brunette Kathy Williams, among others, in a series of vignettes surrounding sex in and with people in an office. Williams and Jordan have a lesbian encounter and a gay transvestite is talked into experimenting with a woman who deep throats bananas. Office Love-in, White-Collar Style also features Colleen Murphy (the star of Alice in Acidland) and Forman Shane, who was in just about all of Apostolof's films. Lady Godiva Rides (1969) Motel Confidential (1969) The Divorcee (1969) =1970s= Drop Out Wife (1972) Ed Wood co-wrote The Class Reunion (1972) Ed Wood co-wrote The Snow Bunnies (1972) Ed Wood co-wrote The Cocktail Hostesses (1973) Ed Wood co- wrote Five Loose Women (1974) Ed Wood co-wrote, played two roles on screen, another off, voiced the trailer The Beach Bunnies (1976) A soft core film made with Ed Wood as a co-screenwriter. Hot Ice (1978) Hot Ice, Apostolof's last picture, was an attempt at making a caper movie with an intricate plot and more action than usual in his films. It tells the story of a pair of male and female con artists who go into hiding at a ski lodge. Wood had a role, but it got axed due to his drinking. He was an assistant director. Hot Ice marks the demise of classic sexploitation cinema with its content absorbed into mainstream movies. Hardcore porn films had gained a firm foothold in the theatrical market by this point and had pushed out much of the \\"soft-core\\" product. The advent of the home video market in the late '70s also accelerated the decline of the sexploitation genre. Apostolof's struggles to finance another film project‚Äîor even a sequel to his successful \\"Orgy of the Dead\\"‚Äîin the late '70s were doomed to failure. The sheer numbers of hardcore porn films available on video‚Äîwhich could be viewed at home, rather than the consumer having to go to a public theater‚Äîpretty much killed the \\"sexploitation\\" theatrical market. At the beginning of the decade Apostolof found his way into film distribution. He owned the rights to all of his films and spent the '80s and '90s reselling them on the home video / DVD market. Unrealized projects Apostolof developed several film ideas that never saw completion (e.g., Wood-scripted The Teachers, The Basketballers). The most notable of these were a sequel to his most successful film Orgy of the Dead called The New Generation and a thriller entitled State of Fear. In the early '90s he was also planning on shooting a documentary on his own life and career. Personal life Apostolof was married three times. His first marriage was to a woman named Joan, and it produced four children: Maria, Susan, Polly and Steve. In 1964, after divorcing Joan, he married Patricia J. Rudl, but three years later they divorced. In 1973 he met and married Shelley Barbara Cooper and had a son Christopher. After the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Apostolof moved with Shelley to Las Vegas, Nevada, and then to Mesa, Arizona. =Religion= Although he was part of one of the most \\"liberated\\" industries and most of his films had a strong sexual content, Apostolof himself was a very religious man. On December 8, 1961, he and Dr. Matthew Jeikoff along with other Bulgarian emigres founded \\"St. George\\", the first Bulgarian Orthodox church in Los Angeles. The church had strong ties to Simeon II, the Bulgarian king in exile, and soon became a bulwark of Bulgarian anti-Communists and monarchists in Los Angeles. Death Near the end of his life, Apostolof had worked on the script for a projected post-apocalyptic thriller entitled State of Fear. Despite some preliminary work, the story was never filmed. Stephen Apostolof died on August 14, 2005, aged 77 in Mesa, Arizona. Legacy Apostolof made 17 feature films in a career that lasted only 20 years. Today Apostolof may not be a household‚Äîor even vaguely familiar‚Äîname to many, but he and his films have attracted a cult following over the years. His legacy lives on, ridiculed or revered by critics and fans alike. He has taken a permanent place in the B-movie culture and is widely recognized as one of the greatest American erotic filmmakers. In 1987 The Tokyo International Fantastic Film Festival honored him with a special screening of Orgy of the Dead, and all his films were released on video in the 1980s and re-released on DVD in the 1990s and 2000s. In 2007 Legend House released Suburbia Confidential and College Girl Confidential as a double- feature DVD., Johnny Legend's Deadly Doubles, Vol. 6: Suburbia Confidential/OfficeLove-In (1966). In 2010 S'More Entertainment reissued three of Apostolof's films on DVD complete with original trailers and stills. , The Lascivious World of A.C. Stephen & Edward D. Wood, Jr., by Adam Becvar (aka Luigi Bastardo) In 2011 Apostolof was the subject of a documentary entitled Dad Made Dirty Movies. In April 2007 the British film magazine Sight & Sound listed him among the most prominent figures in sexploitation genre. He was dubbed the \\"Prince of Confidential\\" because of his series of films with the word \\"confidential\\" in the title. Actor Marty L. Andaluz portrayed a fictional version of Apostolof in the play The Incredible Story of Ed Wood., http://www.rayzoomay.net/@api/deki/files/2/=Marty_L.Andaluz.PDF. In 2006 the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction ran an exhibition called \\"Sex in the Cinema\\". A poster from Orgy of the Dead was featured, along with artwork from other prominent sexploitation directors like Russ Meyer, Radley Metzger and Gerard Damiano., Sex in the Cinema: an Abbreviated History. In 2000 Apostolof was canonized as the \\"patron saint of the pornographers\\" in the Church of Ed Wood., Lesson 19: The First Saints of Woodism. Where Reverend Steve and the Board of Woodian Reverends announce the first list of Holy Woodian Saints! Frequent and memorable collaborators Apostolof worked with the same people more than once. Some of his frequent collaborators include Edward D. Wood Jr., Marsha Jordan, Rene Bond, Harvey Shane (often credited under the alias Forman Shane), Ric Lutze and Vincent Barbi, among others. =Cameos= Like Alfred Hitchcock, one of the directors Apostolof admired, he appeared briefly in some of his own films. For example, he is seen in Journey to Freedom where he's playing a Frenchman sporting beret and a moustache. In Lady Godiva Rides he is credited under the name One Eye Apostolof. In the beginning of The Beach Bunnies he plays the piano in a restaurant. In The Snow Bunnies he could be spotted sitting in front of a ski chalet together with his third wife Shelley.

The population of the civil parish taken at the 2011 census was 653. It is also the name of the nearby post war council housing estate. The village lies within the Broxtowe district, whilst the estate is in the City of Nottingham. The village is separated from the housing estate by the A6002 road.  Village  The village of Strelley was first recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086, where it appears as Straleia. The name means 'clearing on a street or Roman road', though there is not known to be a Roman road in the area.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.450. The village has quite a secluded atmosphere as it is not on a through-road for traffic, although bridleways ran from the village to Cossall to the west, and to Kimberley to the north. The old Broad Oak pub remains but has been partially modernised. Strelley is also notable for being the upper terminus of one of the earliest recorded railway lines in the world, the Wollaton Waggonway. The railway ran to Wollaton. Horse-drawn coal wagons travelled to their destination on wooden railway lines. This type of railway is known as a wagonway and it was completed during 1604. It was built by Huntingdon Beaumont working in partnership with the second occupier of Wollaton Hall, Sir Percival Willoughby. Coal mining was a significant industry in Strelley during Elizabethan and Stuart times. Notable families involved in the early mining of Strelley included the Strelleys and the Byrons; it was a Byron who sub-leased the pits to Huntingdon Beaumont. During the 1960s much of the western part of Strelley parish was dominated by a huge opencast coal mine. After the opencast mine closed, the M1 motorway was constructed over the west of the parish. The village church All Saints' Church, Strelley can now easily be seen from the motorway just north of the Trowell services area. Geography The main television transmitter for Nottingham is in the parish, which takes signals from Waltham.Freeview Nottingham transmitterMB21 Nottingham transmitter The transmitter is also known as Swingate as it is east of Swingate Farm. The transmitter is next to the Kimberley parish boundary, and the Robin Hood Way. The transmitter base is at a height of around 130 metres, and near a trig point at Windmill Farm. References *.

They are located in the western Democratic Republic of the Congo and 140 miles southwest of Kinshasa. Inga Falls on the Congo River is a group of rapids (or cataracts) downstream of the Livingstone Falls and the Pool Malebo. The Congo falls ~ within this set of cataracts. The mean annual flow rate of the Congo River at Inga Falls is ~. Given this flow rate and the 96 metre fall, the Inga Falls alone has a potential to generate ~ of mechanical energy and nearly as much electrical energy. Inga Falls is currently the site of two large hydro power plants and is being considered for a much larger hydro power generating station known as Grand Inga. The Grand Inga project, if completed, would be the largest hydro- electric power generating facility in the world. The current project scope calls for the use of a flow rate ~26,400 cubic metres per second at a net head of ~150 metres; this is equivalent to a generating capacity of ~38.9 GW. This hydro-electric generator would be more than double the current world record holder, which is the Three Gorges facility on the Yangtze River in China. Grand Inga is a \\"run-of-the-river\\" hydroelectric project in which only a relatively small reservoir would be created to back up the power of the river's flow. This would be so that the net head for the hydroelectric turbines could approach 150 metres. History The Belgian colonial government was considering starting what it called \\"The Inga Scheme\\" on the eve of decolonization in 1959. Inga I was completed in 1972, and Inga II in 1982. = Early study = 1890s map of the Inga Falls The hydropower potential of the Congo River was recognized quite early on, at a time when colonial control was expanding over Africa and rivers were first being harnessed to generate electricity. One early report on this potential came via the United States Geological Survey in 1921; their findings concluded that the Congo basin in its entirety possessed \\"more than one-fourth of the world‚Äôs potential water power\\". Regarding the Inga Falls location specifically, this was highlighted just four years later by the Belgian soldier, mathematician, and entrepreneur Colonel Van Deuren. He would continue survey work around Inga Falls, and during the 1920s and 1930s there was some movement towards further study of the area's potential by the group Syneba (1929‚Äì1939), yet the outbreak of World War II and the dissolution of Syneba put a temporary end to progress on the site. Atlantropa, a scheme for integrating Europe and Africa conceived by Herman Sorgel in the 1920s, included a proposal to dam the Congo River. In this plan, the water would have been used to irrigate the deserts of North Africa, and to generate 22.5 to 45 gigawatts of power. = Belgian plan = Despite the lack of progress during and in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the tantalizing possibilities offered by the Inga Falls remained prominent in engineers‚Äô minds. The 1954 book Engineers‚Äô Dreams listed a host of massive projects that could theoretically be accomplished (among them the future Channel Tunnel), the largest being an Inga Dam that would create a lake stretching into the Sahara Desert. Before Congolese independence, the Belgians still harbored the hope of constructing a massive Inga development project to generate electricity for heavy industry. Among those industries discussed were \\"aluminum, ferro-alloys, the treatment of ores, paper, and a plant for the separation of isotopes.\\" Their vision, at least publicly, was bold, with one authority comparing the potential industrial development in the Congo to the German Ruhr. There was an important American connection the project in the form of Clarence E. Blee, one of five foreigners on a 10-person study of the Inga site in 1957 and the chief engineer of the United States‚Äô foray into federal electrical and industrial development, the Tennessee Valley Authority. This study would play a central role in convincing the Belgian authorities to set an Inga dam in motion. An Inga scheme, loosely reported as consisting of a \\"series of power stations and dams\\", was finally passed by the Belgian Cabinet on 13 November 1957, and a group was slated to be created in order to study the possible uses of the project's electricity and the ways in which to fund it. The Cabinet's plan was estimated at the time to cost US$3.16 billion and was expected to generate 25,000 MW. A report from late April 1958 stated that excavation work would hopefully begin by midyear, with 1964/1965 as the year set to bring the initial stage to completion. Plans called for three stages of construction, beginning with a 1,500 MW plant with a $320 million price tag, then twice that capacity, and eventually the 25,000 MW originally approved. Industrial development would advance in step, helped by a start price of $0.002 per kwh, producing 500,000 tons of aluminum with the construction of the first plant and eventually aiming for a final production goal six times that. An international syndicate named Aluminga, comprising a number of European and North American firms, was already organizing to realize this. Funding was an issue, especially once the Belgians realized that they could not accomplish such a project alone. Possible investors cited by the press included the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank. In February 1959 a group of prominent American investors including David Rockefeller visited the Inga Falls, though construction was continually being pushed back from original estimates, then slated for 1961 or later. Congolese independence from Belgium did not suddenly erase the importance of Inga development. Belgian authorities were still pushing the project while negotiating independence with Congolese delegates, with Minister Raymond Scheyven proposing a joint Congolese-Belgian company that would fund an Inga dam. This was not a minor idea, but the main project in a five-year Congolese development plan he proposed. That advice was apparently not heeded, as newly elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba signed a fifty-year contract with the Wall Street-based Congo International Management Corporation to develop the Congo on 22 July 1960, with an Inga project and associated aluminum production at the top of the list. PM Lumumba later backtracked and claimed that the deal was \\"only an agreement in principle\\", but regardless he was deposed by Army Chief of Staff Mobutu Sese Seko less than two months later. = Inga I and Inga II = Inga I facility Despite the ensuing period of instability, rebellions, and UN interventions in the first half of the 1960s, it did not dampen leaders' hopes to harness the rapids of the Congo River. From the wreckage of the Belgian departure and the subsequent turmoil emerged Mobutu S√©s√© Seko, who seized full power for himself in November 1965 and would remain the Congo's authoritarian president until May 1997. It was during his reign that the first and so far only projects were built to generate power from the Inga Falls. Inga I was the first project brought to completion. A feasibility study was conducted by the Italian firm SICAI in 1963, which recommended the dam support domestic industrialization as opposed to export focused industry. Funded mainly by the government, construction took place from 1968 to 1972, leaving a six-turbine plant generating 351 MW. This electricity was mainly fed to the populated areas around it and downstream; its successor was explicitly for mining activity in the south. Inga II was the second hydro project built at the site just south of Inga I. Even with just eight turbines, it was built to produce 1,424 MW, and was completed a full decade after Inga I. = Inga-Shaba power line = In order to connect the power generating capacity at Inga with the copper and cobalt mines located near the Zambian border in Shaba Province (now Katanga), a new project aimed to build the longest high-voltage direct current power line in existence, bypassing local communities and converting into alternating current at its final destination. The various groups involved had economic as well as political agendas; while Western investors and the Congolese government wished to support the Shaba mines during a period of elevated copper prices, the government also wanted to consolidate its power over the secessionist southern province, and the West had an interest in seeing the Congo stay firmly in the anti-communist camp. The cost for the project was constantly revised upward, eventually reaching $500 million over budget. A mix of private and public groups provided the financing, notably Citibank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and it was the storied Boise, Idaho-based company, Morrison-Knudsen, that was contracted to do the work. In 1980, the costs of the Inga-Shaba power line totaled 24% of Congo's debt, which along with corruption, other wasteful spending, and bad decision-making, led to a debt crisis and the intervention of foreign experts. As of 1999, Congo still owed the U.S. Export-Import Bank over $900 million, leaving American taxpayers unpaid. As the Inga-Shaba line neared completion in the early 1980s, many news articles poured scorn on the project. One from the Washington Post juxtaposed its failure with a successful Peace Corps project to improve the Congolese diet, noting that, \\"the grandiose project has so far turned out to be a white elephant, while the low-key fish-farming endeavor has already made visible improvements in the lives of several thousand people in a similar period of time.\\" G√©camines, the state-owned mining company in Shaba that was founded in 1906 by the Belgians, ended up still mainly using hydroelectricity supplied locally, and thus the Inga-Shaba line found itself being used at a mere third of capacity. Furthermore, the structure itself has been degraded as local peoples have used its metal bars for a variety of domestic needs. Current dams Inga dam projects, as of 2006. The two hydroelectric dams, Inga I and Inga II, currently operate at a low output. Inga I has a total installed capacity of 351 MW and Inga II has 1424 MW. They were built under former president Mobutu Sese Seko as part of the Inga‚ÄìShaba project. = Rehabilitation = The DRC has faced the problem of rehabilitating the two existing dams, which have fallen into disrepair and operate far below original capacity at roughly 40%, or just over 700 MW combined. In May 2001 Siemens was reportedly negotiating with the government over a billion-dollar partnership that would involve restoration and modernization of the DRC's electrical grid, including the rehabilitation of the two existing Inga power plants, though work was delayed. In mid-2003 there was also a report that the World Bank had signed a $450 million contract with Siemens to improve water and electrical distribution in the DRC, including rehabilitation of the two Inga projects (reported at the time to be at 30% capacity) and a second electrical line from Inga to the capital. It is unclear what transpired concerning these contracts. Separately in May 2005 the Canadian company MagEnergy signed an agreement with SNEL to rehabilitate some of Inga II's turbines, with a completion goal of 2009. Actual work to rehabilitate Inga II finally began 27 April 2006, just under a year after the initial agreement with MagEnergy was signed. This first phase, which involved fixing a single 168 MW turbine and other emergency repair work, was reported 90% complete in April 2009, and the second phase (four other turbines) was estimated to take five additional years. However, there is doubt over whether the government accepts the validity of the contract, and in the meantime the Canadian company First Quantum was hired to rehabilitate two separate Inga II turbines. To carry out the repairs, the SNEL has received funding from the Regional and Domestic Power Markets Development Project, which is itself supported by the World Bank, African Development Bank, and European Investment Bank. Expansion plans Official projections for Inga III and Grand Inga, as of 2006. There are expansion plans to create a third Inga dam, Inga III. Projections indicate that once completed, Inga III would generate 4,500 MW of electricity. Inga III is the centerpiece of the Westcor partnership which envisions the interconnection of the electric grids of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Namibia, Angola, Botswana, and South Africa. The World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, bilateral donors, and the southern African power companies, have all expressed interest in pursuing the project which is estimated to cost US$80 billion. One enthusiastic backer of Inga development has been South Africa. In July 1999, newly elected South African President Thabo Mbeki gave a speech to the Organisation of African Unity, highlighting development of the Inga Falls for hydropower as an example of necessary development of Africa's economic infrastructure. For South Africa's public utility Eskom, Inga fit into a broader plan to turn an interconnected African grid into an electricity-exporting powerhouse, eventually supplying Europe and the Middle East. In 2002 Inga was highlighted by the AU's New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) and Eskom was reported to be investigating a $6 billion run-of-the-river type Inga project which would be developed by an Eskom and Hydro-Qu√©bec-led consortium of national utility companies. Such a consortium, dubbed the Western Power Corridor (Westcor) was finally organized in February 2003. Involving five of the region's major utility companies (Eskom, SNEL, Angola's Empresa Nacional de Electricidade, Namibia's NamPower, and the Botswana Power Corporation) it projected initial costs at $1.5 billion and the eventual construction of a 44,000 MW run-of-the-river project. A memorandum of understanding for Westcor was finally signed on 22 October 2004, for the construction of a 3,400 MW Inga III. The following February Eskom unveiled a new $50 billion run-of-the-river scheme. That September 2005 a shareholder agreement for Westcor was signed, giving each party 20%. The DRC appeared to move away from the regional development approach offered by Westcor and instead manage the construction of Inga III on its own. In June 2009 it opened bidding for a $7 billion, 4320 MW Inga III project. Snubbing Westcor, the DRC chose BHP Billiton, which intended to use 2,000 MW for itself, notably for an aluminum smelter. In 2017 proposals were for a 10‚Äì12 GW dam, up from 4.8 GW in earlier plans, with potential completion sometime after 2024. In October 2018, the government of the DRC announced the signing of contracts with a Sino- Spanish consortium to launch design studies for the construction of the Inga III dam with 11,000 MW and a total cost of $ 14 billion. Main companies of the consortium were China Three Gorges Corporation, Sinohydro and ACS Group. While construction plans for phase III were reported in be on track in late 2019, a major potential member of a construction consortium, Spanish firm ACS Group, dropped out in January 2020, leaving uncertainty with remaining Chinese and German partners. = Grand Inga = The Grand Inga Dam, if harnessing much of the power of the river, could generate up to 39,000 MWand would significantly boost the energy available to the African continent at a cost of more than $80 billion. Connecting Inga to a continent-wide electricity grid for main population centers would cost $10 billion more (est. 2000), and would be the world's largest hydroelectric project. Critics contend the huge amounts of money required for the project would be better spent with smaller scale, localized energy projects that would better meet the needs of Africa's poor majority. A study from Oxford University supports this cautious approach by showing that the average cost overrun for 245 large dams in 65 countries across six continents is 96% in real terms. The New Partnership for Africa's Development, with significant involvement of South African electric power company ESKOM, suggested in 2003 to start the Grand Inga project in 2010. At an installed capacity of 39,000 MW, the Grand Inga Dam alone could produce 250 TWh annually, or a total of 370 TWh annually for the whole site. In 2005, Africa's annual electricity production was 550 TWh (600 kWh per capita). The project is expected to top US$100 billion in total development costs.The Grand Inga Dam On May 2016 construction looked as if it would begin within several months. However, on July 2016 the World Bank withdrew its funding following disagreements over the project despite power purchase agreements from South Africa and mining companies. The first phase grant would have totaled US$73.1 million. Some observers are skeptical of the project, citing its high cost in a country known for its endemic corruption‚Äîrisking little benefit to the population.Grand Inga development  Africa's electric energy disparity  Africa produces a very low amount of electric energy per capita compared to other regions of the world. Projects such as the Grand Inga Dam, which can generate 43.5 GW, can help solve Africa's electricity shortage. In 2005, South Africa and North Africa produced 70% of the 550 TWh (63 GW) electric output of the continent. South Africa: 230 TWh p.a. / 26.2 GW (4500 kWh p.a. per capita / 513 W per capita) North Africa: 150 TWh p.a. / 17.1 GW (1000 kWh p.a. per capita /114 W per capita) Sub Saharan Africa (South Africa excluded): 170 TWh p.a. / 19.4 GW (250 kWh p.a. per capita / 29 W per capita) There is speculation that the Grand Inga Dam can produce enough electricity for the whole continent. That was true before the 1990s. The continent has annual economic and population growth respectively of 5% and 2.5%. In 2005, electricity usage was 600 kWh per capita for the 910 million Africans. The region with chronic power shortages is Sub Saharan Africa (South Africa excluded), where production was only 250 kWh per capita for 700 million people. An African average of at least 1000 kWh per capita requires a total continental production of more than 1000 TWh p.a. / 120 GW. This is equivalent to three times the maximum capacity of Grand Inga Dam. The world average per capita was 3044 kWh in 2012 (The World Bank: 2014 The Little Data Book). According to some, Grand Inga would be too large a proportion of the African demand (43.5 GW combined output compared to a load of 63 GW) to be a practical power source without interconnection by a wide area synchronous grid for example, as well as other power grids. Any large-scale failure of the dam, or its connections to the grid, such as the 2009 Brazil and Paraguay blackout (17 GW), or the 2009 Sayano‚ÄìShushenskaya power station accident in Siberia (6.4 GW), would plunge large parts of Africa into a power failure with potentially serious consequences. The Siberia failure, for example, had a disastrous effect on local aluminium smelters. By this argument, full utilization requires interconnection with Europe, so that power to Europe can then be back fed to Africa. This increases the stability of both systems and reduces overall costs. Three international consortia are bidding for the contract to build the dam, known as Inga III, and to sell the power it generates, estimated at 4,800 MW. This is nearly three times the power produced from Inga's two existing dams, which are decades old and have been crippled by neglect because of government debt and risk-averse investors. The World Bank said, under the current plan, South Africa would buy 2,500 MW from Inga III, and another 1,300 MW would be sold to Congo's power-starved mining industry. The remaining 1000 megawatts would go to the national utility SNEL, helping provide power to an estimated 7 million people around Kinshasa, Congo's capital, and covering all the projected unmet electricity needs there by 2025.

In the book, Fry is candid about his past indiscretions, including stealing, cheating and lying. The book covers some of the same ground as in Fry's first novel, The Liar, published in 1991. In that work, public schoolboy Adrian Healey falls in love with a boy called Hugo Cartwright; in the autobiography, 14-year-old Fry becomes besotted with 13-year-old \\"Matthew Osborne\\".

Through wearing sandals, people's feet would become filthy in the dusty desert environment and upon entering a home feet would be washed with water by pouring water over them into a washpot. Moab, which had threatened Israel, was to be so completely subdued, and so became likened to a wash pot or basin.

Recognition Cephalastor estela showing the position of tegulae and parategulae relative to the mesoscutum and pronotum Most eumenine species are black or brown, and commonly marked with strikingly contrasting patterns of yellow, white, orange, or red (or combinations thereof), but some species, mostly from tropical regions, show faint to strong blue or green metallic highlights in the background colors. Like most vespids, their wings are folded longitudinally at rest. They are particularly recognized by the following combination of characteristics: 1) a posterolateral projection known as a parategula on both sides of the mesoscutum; 2) tarsal claws cleft; 3) hind coxae with a longitudinal dorsal carina or folding, often developed into a lobe or tooth; and 4) fore wings with three submarginal cells. Biology A potter wasp nest on a brick wall in coastal South Carolina Eumenine wasps are diverse in nest building. The different species may either use existing cavities (such as beetle tunnels in wood, abandoned nests of other Hymenoptera, or even man-made holes like old nail holes and screw shafts on electronic devices) that they modify in several degrees, or they construct their own either underground or exposed nests. The nest may have one or several individual brood cells. The most widely used building material is mud made of a mixture of soil and regurgitated water, but many species use chewed plant material, instead. The name \\"potter wasp\\" derives from the shape of the mud nests built by species of Eumenes and similar genera. It is believed that Native Americans based their pottery designs upon the form of local potter wasp nests.[von Frisch, 1974]. All known eumenine species are predators, most of them solitary mass provisioners, though some isolated species show primitive states of social behaviour and progressive provisioning. Potter wasp building a nest When a cell is completed, the adult wasp typically collects beetle larvae, spiders, or caterpillars and, paralyzing them, places them in the cell to serve as food for a single wasp larva. For example, Euodynerus foraminatus paralyzes the larvae of the poison hemlock moth (A. alstroemeriana). As a normal rule, the adult wasp lays a single egg in the empty cell before provisioning it. Some species lay the egg in the opening of the cell, suspended from a thread of dried fluid. When the wasp larva hatches, it drops and starts to feed upon the supplied prey for a few weeks before pupating. The complete lifecycle may last from a few weeks to more than a year from the egg until the adult emerges. Adult potter wasps feed on floral nectar. Taxonomy Potter wasps are the most diverse subfamily of vespids, with almost 200 genera, and contain the vast majority of species in the family (nearly 3000 species from a total of about 4500 in the whole family). The overwhelming morphological diversity of the potter wasp species is reflected in the proliferation of genera described to group them into more manageable groups. The subfamily Zethinae was formerly included here, but was removed when it was recognized that it rendered Eumeninae paraphyletic.PK Piekarski, JM Carpenter, AR Lemmon, E Moriarty- Lemmon, BJ Sharanowski (2018) Phylogenomic Evidence Overturns Current Conceptions of Social Evolution in Wasps (Vespidae).

The company produced four versions of the machine: * The original Orion, sometimes referred to as the \\"Microcodeable Orion\\". * The Orion 1/05, in which the microcodeable CPU was replaced with the much faster Fairchild Clipper RISC C-100 processor providing approximately 5.5 MIPS of integer performance and 1 Mflop of double precision floating point performance. * The Orion 1/07 which offered approximately 33% greater performance over the 1/05 (7.3 MIPS and 1.33 Mflops). * The Orion 1/10 based on a later generation C-300 Clipper from the Advanced Processor Division at Intergraph Corporation that required extensive cooling. The Orion 1/10 offered a further 30% improvement for integer and single precision floating point operations and over 150% improvement for double precision floating point (10 MIPS and 3 Mflops). All four machines employed the same I/O sub-system.  Background  High Level Hardware was an independent British company formed in early 1982 by David G. Small and Timothy B. Robinson. David Small was previously a founder shareholder and director of Oxford-based Research Machines Limited. Both partners were previously senior members of Research Machine's Special Projects Group. In 1984, as a result of that research, High Level Hardware launched the Orion, a high performance, microcodeable, UNIX superminicomputer targeted particularly at scientific applications such as mathematical modeling, artificial intelligence and symbolic algebra. In April 1987 High Level Hardware introduced a series of Orions based upon the Fairchild Clipper processor but abandoned the hardware market in late 1989 to concentrate on high-end Apple Macintosh sales.  Microcodeable Orion  The original Orion employed a processor architecture based on Am2900-series devices. This CPU was novel in that its microcode was writable; in other words, its instruction set could be redefined. This facility was used to customise some Orions with instruction sets optimised to run the Occam and LISP programming languageshttp://www.freaknet.org/martin/tape/gos/support/hlh/remc or even to compute fractals.http://www.cb1.com/~john/research/PhD/mandelbrot.txt =The central processing unit= The CPU consisted of an ALU that was built around the Am2901 bit-sliced microprocessor. To this a byte manipulation unit was added which could perform the shifting, rotating and masking operation required for handling eight and sixteen bit data. Additional logic was provided to support both signed and unsigned two's complement comparisons in a single operation, multiple precision arithmetic and floating point normalization. Most operations could be performed in 150 ns, however the cycle time was variable from 125 ns to 200 ns under microprogram control so that timing could be optimized. A microsequencer, based around the Am2910, directed the control flow through the microprogram. It could perform branches, loops and subroutine calls most of which could be conditional on any of several CPU status conditions. The CPU instruction decoder, decoded machine level instructions (as opposed to micro-instructions). This was achieved by using map tables held in fast parity checked RAM which mapped one byte opcodes onto micro-instruction addresses. Control was transferred to these addresses using a special sequencer operation which was performed in parallel with other CPU functions. Hence instruction decoding overlapped instruction execution. An escape mechanism was provided to allow the instruction set to be expanded beyond the 256 entries selected by any one opcode. A further mechanism existed to switch between several sets of dispatch tables, allowing the machine to support multiple instruction sets concurrently. Using this mechanism a different instruction set could be selected each time a context switch occurred. This mechanism was also used to implement privileged instruction, dynamic profiling (for performance monitoring) and multiple CPU modes (e. g. User and Kernel). The role of the cache memory, independent of the main memory, was to hold the top of an evaluation stack for a procedure oriented language. The cache had a two cycle latency after which it could deliver one word per cycle and was divided into a number of pages each with 512 32-bit words with parity protection. The pages were grouped in pairs with an architectural maximum of 16 pairs. The original machine implemented two pairs. The second member of each pair was typically used as additional fast registers and scratch storage without affecting the stack page. The lower nine bits of the CPU register, which addressed the cache, was implemented with counters and allowed increment and decrement operations (push and pop) as wells as random access. =The control store= The control store was built using high speed static RAMs. This was normally loaded at bootstrap time, allowing the machine to be fully user microprogrammable. The control store cycle time was 125 ns, equal to the fastest CPU cycle. The architecture allowed for up to 32 Kwords (64 bit word length) of control store however due to the limitation in memory technology the original implementation allowed a maximum of 8 Kwords. The standard configuration had 4 Kwords on a single circuit board. Two such boards could be installed. Parity checking was provided. To achieve the required speed at reasonable cost, a two-level pipeline was employed around the control store. Later a 16 Kword board was implemented giving a maximum control store size of 32 Kwords. =Main memory= Main memory was organised as 32-bit words with two-way interleaving, allowing 64 bits of data to be fetched or stored in one operation. In normal operation main memory was accessed via a virtual memory management unit. In the original implementation, each main memory module contained 0.5 Mbytes of storage with parity protection constructed using 64K dynamic MOS RAMs. Random access cycle time was 500 ns per 32-bit word but multi-word transfers, for example to and from the cache, yielded an effective cycle time of 250 ns per 32-bit word (16 Mbytes per second). The memory modules decoded 26-bit physical word addresses and within this limit total memory capacity was restricted only by the number of available system bus slots; depending on the I/O configuration of the system, up to 10 Mbytes of physical memory could be installed. A later implementation of the memory module increased the size to 2 MB using 256K RAMs. Logical to physical address translation was carried out using a set of address translation tables. Each process has access to three independently extensible regions of memory, used typically for program, heap and stack. A fourth region was normally reserved for the operating system. The tables also contained a set of rights bits for each memory page giving full protection and supporting the implementation of demand paged virtual memory. The translation tables were cached in the CPU resulting, in most cases, in an overhead of only one microinstruction when performing address translation. The page size which was fixed by the hardware, was 4 Kbytes. Each logical region could be up to 256 Mbytes. The input/output subsystem The Orion I/O subsystems included a number of attached microcomputers to perform low level tasks such as running diagnostics and managing terminals and disks. The diagnostic microcomputer (based around the Zilog Z80) was embedded within the CPU. Its functions included running a system confidence check when power is first applied, bootstrapping the CPU, and taking control should an unrecoverable control store parity error be detected. It could also be used to load new microcode dynamically whilst the machine was running. An RS-232C interface was provided to which a terminal could be attached. Extensive diagnostics could then be run in conjunction with special microcode to perform fault analysis in the event of a system failure. Problems could usually be isolated to one or two integrated circuits. One or more intelligent I/O channels controlled peripheral activity. Each of these included a full function microcomputer based around the Z80 which performed control functions and housekeeping. Data transfers to and from peripheral devices took place via a direct memory access (DMA) path itself constructed using Am2901 bit-slice microprocessors. This allowed the full performance of the Orion memory system and of the peripheral device to be exploited, with the microcomputer able to take corrective action on soft I/O errors. Software on the Orion communicated with the microcomputer using a high level message passing protocol. Operating system The operating system for the microcodable Orion was OTS (Orion Time Sharing) version 1.x, a port of the 4.1BSD UNIX operating system. The Clipper-powered Orions ran OTS version 2.x, a port of the 4.2BSD UNIX with some additions. This was not notably reliable or secure, and had a tendency to 'forget' process user IDs, randomly leaving user processes running as root. HLH also produced a graphics terminal for the Orion called the StarPoint, to which they ported the X Window System. HLH Orions at the University of Kent The Orion series was moderately popular with the computer science departments of British universities, including Westfield College, Londonhttp://hlhco.info/photos/Guardian-Jan-04-1984.jpg, Bath, Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt, Kent, Southampton, Warwick, York, King's College, London. A typical multi-user Orion configuration would have had 8 MB of RAM, an SMD hard disk (e.g. a 168 MB Kennedy or a 434 MB Fujitsu Eagle), a 60 MB QIC-24 tape drive and 8 to 32 RS-232 terminal ports.

It is from the Athenian harbor of Piraeus. The municipality Kythnos is in area and has a coastline of about . It has more than 70 beaches, many of which are still inaccessible by road. Of particular note is the crescent-shaped isthmus of fine sand at Kolona.  Settlements  left The island has two significant settlements, the village of Messaria or Kythnos (pop. 561 in 2011 census), known locally as Chora, and the village of Dryopis or Dryopida (pop. 325), also known as Chorio. Both villages are notable for their winding and often stepped streets, too narrow for vehicular traffic. The villages are very picturesque but in different architectural styles. Chora has the more-typical flat roofs of the Cyclades, while Dryopida's rooftops are slanted and tiled. Chora is also notable for its large Greek Orthodox Church. There is also a growing coastal settlement called Kanala on the east side of the island, and many of the larger beaches are settled by a handful of residents. Aghios Dimitrios, at the southern tip of the island, is a mostly modern settlement, with small vacation houses dotting the hillside above a wide beach that is dotted with sea daffodils. On the northeast end of the island lies Loutra (pop. 81), a village famous for its thermal springs, which are said to have curative properties. Although the large tourist hotel there has been closed for several years, the bathhouse is still functioning and visitors may soak in its marble tubs for a modest fee. The port town is called Merichas (pop. 369), its population significantly fluctuating during the year. Before the 1970s, there were no year-round residents in recent history; a Greek fisherman named Manolas Psaras and his wife Foto were the first to live in the port year-round. Today, there is a growing year-round population, and, especially during the peak of the summer tourist season, the town becomes quite busy. Many residents of the port speak at least some English, the most popular second language. Merihas is connected to Piraeus and to Lavrion by ferry boat, and the ride takes one to four hours, depending on the speed of the ship and the weather. Construction of a new mole began in 2005 to accommodate larger ferryboats and was completed in 2008. Kythnos was until recently considered to be one of the last Cycladic islands unaffected by the impact of tourism, but this is inexorably changing. Still, the island has not yet been overdeveloped, and in the more remote areas of the villages, traditional ways live on relatively unchanged.  History  = Pre-history = Kythnos can lay claim to one of the oldest known habitations in the Cycladic islands, a Mesolithic settlement (10000 BCE ‚Äì 8000 BCE) at Maroulas on the northeast coast. The site, close to the village of Loutra, is situated on the shore, and large portions have eroded into the sea. Excavations in 1996 found intact human skeletons, along with stone artifacts and part of a floor pavement, which indicates a long-term settlement, probably of hunter- gatherers. =Pre-Antiquity= Throughout Kythnos, drylaid stone walls delineate individual parcels of land Third millennium BCE (First Cycladic Period) findings at Skouries near the highest peak of the island, Mt. Profitis Elias, suggest that Kythnos was a supplier of raw materials for metallurgy to other islands during the Bronze Age. Remains of copper smelting sites and open-air copper mines were investigated in 1984‚Äì1985. (A recent paper by Myrto Georgakopoulo points to the seminal work here by Gale and others.) The earliest inhabitants of the island known to historians were the Kares (Carians), a pre-Hellenic tribe probably allied to or under the dominion of the Minoans, who eventually were forced by pressure of invading tribes to move on and settle in Asia Minor. Herodotus (Bk. viii, 73) records that in the 13th century BCE, another pre-Hellenic tribe, the Dryopes, originally from the Greek mainland near Mount Parnassus, migrated to the islands, first to Euboea and later spreading to Kea, Kythnos, and beyond. This tribe most probably gave rise to the name of one of the two main villages, Dryopis or Dryopida. Some sources say the island took its name from King Kythnos of the Dryopes; others suggest this is a mythical rather than a historical figure. (Speculations on the origin of the name are contained in Vallinda, 1896.) The Dryopes eventually moved on as well under pressure from Ionians, who migrated out of mainland Greece as Dorian tribes moved in from the north. Ancient walls at Vryokastro A Hellenistic site at Vryokastro, above the bay of Episkopi on the northwest part of the island, was partially excavated in the mid-20th century, yielding floor plans of houses and a sanctuary, as well as a few artifacts. In Greek newspaper articles of December 19, 2002, archaeologist Alexandros Mazarakis-Ainian announced a spectacular discovery on this site: an inner sanctum (adyton) of the temple was found intact and unplundered. Over 1,400 objects, including precious jewels and gold, silver and bronze artifacts, terracotta figurines, and painted vases, were excavated from what the archaeologists have determined is a 2,700-year-old temple dedicated to either Hera, queen of the gods, or Aphrodite, goddess of love. The artifacts date mostly from the 7th to the 5th centuries BCE. The site at Vryokastro was inhabited until Roman times. In this era, the islands of the Cyclades suffered frequent predation by pirates, and perhaps for this reason, the main settlements moved inland and to more defensible locations. Remains of another old settlement, with extensive stone walls, can be seen in the extreme northern headland. This site, called Kastro (Greek for Castle), was likely the capital of the island from about the 1st century through the Byzantine era and into Frankish times. This site seems nearly impregnable: on three sides is a sheer drop to the sea. The fourth side is approached via a narrow track, which was barricaded with a thick, high wall, parts of which are still extant (along with walls delineating hundreds of houses). Nevertheless, there is evidence that the town was destroyed and rebuilt several times. The population fluctuated dramatically during this period and at times the island was decimated due to marauders and plague (Smith, 1854 and Bent, 1885, reprinted 2002). = Antiquity = The village of Driopida. Typical village street. Only rarely is the island mentioned by ancient authors. In the Battle of Salamis (480 BCE), Herodotus records that Kythnos contributed a trireme and a penteconter, and this contribution is commemorated on the base of a golden tripod at Delphi (Herodotus, Bk viii, 46). Innumerable sources repeat, without providing a citation, that Aristotle praised the government of Kythnos in his \\"Constitution of Kythnos.\\" Exactly what he wrote is difficult to ascertain, since all of his essays on the constitutions of 158 city-states are lost except for the one on Athens. (Possibly, the origin of the quote is from the 2nd century lexicographer Harpocration. See Smith, 1854. The entry on Kythnos is under the spelling \\"Cythnus\\"). = Crusader & Venetian Era = In 1207, Kythnos was annexed to the Frankish overlord Marco Sanudo's Aegean Duchy of the Archipelago (or of Naxos), and it remained in Venetian hands for 400 years. During this period, it was known as Thermia, a name derived from the hot mineral springs occurring on the northeastern coast at the village of Loutra (which means \\"baths\\" in Greek). These medicinal baths were renowned at least since Roman times and were a fashionable spa and resort area. In 1600, Thermia also became the new name of a Latin bishopric on the Cyclades, formerly known as Roman Catholic Diocese of Ceo (now a Latin Catholic titular see). The island capital remained at Kastro, which was rebuilt as a Frankish fortress and was known as the Tower of Thermia (Smith, 1854 and Bent, 1885, reprinted 2002). = Ottoman Era = Following a siege, the Turks were victorious over the last Venetian overlord, Angelo Gozzadini, in 1617. (According to a story recounted by J.L. Bent in his 1885 travelogue on the Cyclades, Kastro fell only because of a treacherous ploy by the Turks: a young woman, heavy with child and apparently in pain, approached the entrance and begged to be admitted; the watchman's daughter opened the gate for her‚Äîand for the Turks hiding nearby. Bent writes that this version is preserved in a popular island ballad (Bent, 1885, reprinted 2002, chap. 17). After its fall to the Turks, Kastro was abandoned and the new capital was located inland, as the name Messaria suggests. Later, this town became known as Hora (the generic Greek name for a capital town, also spelled Chora). Under the Ottomans, Kythnos enjoyed religious freedom, but Rome suppressed the diocese of Thermia in 1650. It was a poor, under-populated place, still beset by pirates and suffering frequent epidemics. Most of its population succumbed to the plague in 1823. Nevertheless, it was one of the first islands to revolt against the Turks and join mainland Greece in its fight for independence. During the reign of the first Greek King, Othon, Kythnos was a place of exile for political prisoners and was the scene of an unsuccessful revolt in 1862 by rebels from Syros who attempted to free the prisoners. = Modern Kythnos = View of Merichas Beach in Kythnos In the 19th century, Kythnians mainly earned their living as they had for centuries before: as shepherds or by fishing. The island had few natural resources and, lacking a deep-water mooring for boats, was relatively inaccessible. Then, as the new century dawned, iron ore was discovered on the island and Kythnians were able to supplement their meager incomes by working in the mines. These mines, however, were mostly played out by World War II, and once again, the population of the island went into decline, as young people left to find employment and a better life in Athens or even further afield. The Greek tourist boom beginning in the mid-20th century largely bypassed Kythnos because its harbor lacked a deep-water dock for ferryboats. The construction of a new mole in 1974 precipitated great changes. Today, the island is a modern, prosperous place, with a burgeoning tourist trade. It is in the forefront of alternative energy experiments, with the establishment in 1982 of Greece's first wind park. With the addition of a photovoltaic system and storage batteries, the amount of diesel fuel required to supply the island's electricity has been reduced by 11%. Numerous individual houses on remote coves are equipped with photovoltaic systems, and nearly all houses employ solar water heaters. Due to its proximity to Athens, Kythnos has become a fashionable setting for vacation homes, in addition to being an accessible destination for foreign visitors. Besides its numerous beaches and picturesque villages, it also is the site of one of the largest caves in Greece, Katafiki Cave in Dryopida. This cave, first visited in the 1830s and described by the geologist Fiedler, has unique \\"schratten\\" or rock curtains, as well as speleotherms. It was the site of an iron mine until 1939 and has now been developed as a tourist attraction.

The story is a close adaptation of the first few volumes of the original manga, adapting the Karate Tournament arc (not adapted in the later TV series) and Baki's fight with Shinogi Koushou, later adapted in the episode 18 of the Baki the Grappler TV series. It was licensed and released under the title Grappler Baki: The Ultimate Fighter in North America by Central Park Media on VHS on December 1, 1996 and on DVD on December 1, 1998. Manga Entertainment later released it in Australia and the United Kingdom. A 15-minutes original animation DVD (OAD), referred to as , was included with the limited edition of the 14th volume of Baki-Dou on December 6, 2016.

Notably, the anime was produced by Free-Will, a music record label. A second 24-episode series, titled as it tells the story from that part of the manga, aired from July 23, 2001 to December 24, 2001. All of the series' music was written and composed by \\"Project Baki\\", and all the theme songs performed by Ry≈çko Aoyagi.

A set including every episode was released on September 2, 2008. Funimation's English version was one of the launch-shows on their own television channel, Funimation Channel, which debuted on June 19, 2006. Baki was broadcast on weekends at 11:30pm, switching to the 10:00pm slot on September 4, 2006. Dubbed in English, the episodes were edited for time but do not appear to have been edited for content. The opening theme is the song \\"Child Prey\\" by Japanese metal band Dir en grey, who is signed to Free-Will. In December 2016, it was announced that the \\"Most Evil Death Row Convicts\\" arc of the second manga series would be receiving an anime television adaptation.

In September 2020, it was announced Hanma Baki - Son of Ogre will be adapted as the third series and the sequel to the second season of the Netflix series. =Video games= There have been a few video games based on the series. A fighting game developed by Tomy was released for the PlayStation 2 as in Japan in 2000 and as Fighting Fury in the United Kingdom during 2003. Reception As of 2018, the first four Baki series had over 75 million collected volumes in circulation. The Baki Gaiden: Scarface spin-off series had 3.5 million copies in print as of February 2019. Allen Divers and Jason Thompson, both writing for Anime News Network, briefly described the series as \\"very compelling\\" and a \\"demented fighting manga\\", respectively. Anime News Network had four different writers review the first volume of the second manga series. Faye Hopper scored it the highest, four out of five, and wrote that she was captivated the entire read with its appeal lying in \\"its absurdity held up by its absolutely incredible artistry.\\" Amy McNulty gave it a 2.5 rating and also praised Itagaki's art, but felt the character designs were not particularly memorable. She also wrote that the volume \\"succeeds in identifying the stakes, but it completely fails in anchoring the reader with characters to care about.\\" Rebecca Silverman and Teresa Navarro both gave it a 2 and noted its status as a \\"set-up book,\\" with each new character introduced in the same manner. Both Hopper and Silverman said that Baki reminded them of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Reviewing the first 24 episodes of the 2001 anime, Mark Thomas of Mania Entertainment gave it a B‚àí rating, stating that fans of sh≈çnen and fight series would enjoy it, but others should look elsewhere. He felt it had plenty of good, realistic fight scenes, but fell short on the story. Explaining that despite a lot of story arcs, it ultimately feels like a setup for the second season. Thomas gave the same rating to the final 24 episodes, and \\"mildly recommended\\" the series. While he started to enjoy this set more thanks to its more action focus, he stated that not showing Baki's final fight with Yujiro, which was built up the entire show, really ruined it for him. The 2012 comedy film Graffreeter Toki is based on the March 2011 play of the same name, which in turn was inspired by Grappler Baki.

Written by guitarist Dickey Betts, the song is a tribute to Gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, in that it was designed to be played using only two fingers on the left hand. Betts wrote the majority of \\"Jessica\\" at the band's farm in Juliette, Georgia. He named it after his daughter, Jessica Betts, who was an infant when it was released. She had bounced along to the song's rhythm, and Betts attempted to capture her attitude with its melody. He invited fellow guitarist Les Dudek over to collaborate on it, and Dudek performed the bridge. The arrangement was crafted prior to recording, which took place at Capricorn Sound Studios in Macon, Georgia. Issued as a single following the immensely successful \\"Ramblin' Man\\", \\"Jessica\\" did not receive the same level of chart success. Despite this, it became a standard in rotations for classic rock radio stations in the following decades. Reviews have been widely positive. Many critics at the time called it a highlight of the album, and a 2006 Wall Street Journal article deemed it \\"a true national heirloom\\". It is widely known as the theme to the BBC Two motoring program Top Gear. Background After the death of group leader Duane Allman in 1971, the Allman Brothers Band continued on, adding keyboardist Chuck Leavell. A year later when Berry Oakley also died, Lamar Williams was brought in as the bassist replacement, finishing the album Berry did not. The addition of Leavell in particular changed the band's sound and direction, which has often been considered most evident on \\"Jessica\\". Guitarist Dickey Betts wrote the song at \\"the Farm,\\" a 432-acre \\"group hangout\\" in Juliette, Georgia. \\"I really need to have an image in my head before I can start writing an instrumental because otherwise it's too vague. I get an emotion or an idea I want to express and see what I can come up with,\\" said Betts in 2014. \\"Jessica\\" was an attempt to write a song that could be played with just two fingers, in honor of Gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt, who played with two left fingers due to severe burns. Betts had crafted the main melody of the song but became frustrated with its direction afterward. Jessica, Betts's baby daughter, crawled into the room and began bouncing to the music. \\"I started playing along, trying to capture musically the way she looked bouncing around the room,\\" said Betts, who named the song after her. According to session musician Les Dudek, he co-wrote \\"Jessica\\" but did not receive credit. Betts had invited him over for dinner, and instructed him to bring his acoustic guitar. They played the song together, and Betts became frustrated, as it went nowhere following the opening and main verse riff. According to Dudek, he formed the bridge section while Betts was away, checking on their steaks. Upon his return, Dudek showed him his new section. \\"Dickey lit up like a lightbulb he was so happy, because now we had the new section the song desperately needed,\\" he remarked. The two hopped in Betts's pickup truck with their guitars in excitement, with intentions to show each band member their new instrumental. \\"I'll never forget, right when we got in Dickey's truck, it started to lightly, almost mystically, snow, as if it was Duane sending us a message: 'Hey, you guys finally got that tune.'\\" The band had laid down \\"three or four\\" track recordings for Brothers and Sisters when Betts brought \\"Jessica\\" to the studio. Dudek accompanied Betts on guitar, in order to illustrate both the rhythm guitar and the melody. Leavell noted the song presented a challenge, since earlier instrumentals were more serious in nature: \\"How do we make this a little more intense and make it work as an Allman Brothers song?\\" Dudek had worked out harmonies with Betts and believed he would be recording with Betts, but Betts dissuaded him, noting that he had already played harmonies on \\"Ramblin' Man\\" and that critics might believe him to be in the band if he played harmonies on \\"Jessica\\". Dudek instead played the acoustic rhythm guitar, while Leavell played harmonies on piano. \\"I was very disappointed, but there was nothing I could say about it,\\" said Dudek later. The song would wind up with two keyboards and one guitar. In the studio, the musicians worked on the song's arrangement, which took six days. Leavell created the transition between the piano and guitar solos. Betts later likened the song's creation to architecture, noting that it is \\"meticulously constructed, and every aspect has its place.\\" Leavell disagreed with the notion that Dudek co-wrote the song, noting that Betts created the melody of the song and its rhythm. In contrast, Dudek claims Betts walked with him into manager Phil Walden's office, demanding he receive songwriting royalties for Jessica. \\"I didn't understand all that exactly at the time, but in retrospect, I should have got 50 percent. Because it wasn't a completed song until I gave him the bridge section, the part that goes to the G chord,\\" remembered Dudek. Drummer Butch Trucks questioned Dudek's account, noting that they all spent time crafting the arrangement. \\"I wasn't there, so I can't say what Les did or didn't do, but I take that with a grain of salt. Look at the track records of what each of them has written besides Jessica. I think it could be a group credit almost, and if any one person would have a writing claim it would be Chuck Leavell, who added a tremendous amount to 'Jessica',\\" said Trucks. Leavell acknowledged this: \\"I could say I co-wrote it, because I made a lot of suggestions, but I don't think that's fair.\\" After Dudek left Capricorn Records to tour with the Steve Miller Band, he was let out of his contract, which involved no credits on the publishing deal for Brothers and Sisters. He maintains that Betts apologized to him about \\"the whole 'Jessica' thing\\" years later, claiming Capricorn said they did not have to pay him. Composition The tune is in the key of A Major, with the main guitar solo using the key of D Major. The signature melody line, as with all of Dickey Betts' instrumental compositions, is played harmonically among various instruments, in this case, Betts taking the melody on guitar, Chuck Leavell playing the top harmony line on the Fender Rhodes electric piano, and Gregg Allman playing the bottom harmony line on the Hammond organ. Leavell also plays grand piano on this tune, playing a solo around the 2:30 mark. The acoustic guitar is played by Les Dudek. The original version on Brothers and Sisters clocks in at 7:30, although there is a shortened single edit, which cuts out some of the main theme at the end of the piece, trimming it to 4:00 exactly. This version is the one heard on most classic rock radio stations, and any kind of various artist compilation on which \\"Jessica\\" has been featured. However, most Allman Brothers compilations use the full 7:30 version. Reception =Commercial performance= The song peaked best on Billboard Easy Listening chart, where it peaked at number 29 on March 9, 1974. Although \\"Jessica\\" rose no higher than number 65 on the Hot 100, it later became a staple of classic rock radio. =Critical reception= Initial reviews of the song in 1973 were very positive. Bud Scoppa of Rolling Stone wrote, \\"To my ears, this is the most effective instrumental the Allmans have ever recorded: It breaks the band's recent tendency toward humorlessness while demonstrating vividly that this group can elaborate brilliantly on a motif without once falling into obvious blues or rock & roll patterns.\\" Billboard singled it out as one of the \\"best cuts\\" from the album, and it was mentioned as a highlight by Janis Schacht of Circus. \\"The jazzy sound is not only effective, it's aesthetically beautiful. Chuck Leavell's piano work is much on a par with Nicky Hopkins' work for the Rolling Stones. It moves, it boogies, it carries the piece along with incredible style and is met halfway by Dickie Betts' clean, sweeping guitar lead.\\" It has continued to receive praise in recent years. A January 2006 Wall Street Journal article referred to the piece as \\"a true national heirloom.\\" =Awards and nominations= A later recording of \\"Jessica\\", a live recording included on An Evening with the Allman Brothers Band: 2nd Set (1995), won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards in 1996.

In popular culture The tune is also well known as the opening theme to the original BBC TV show Top Gear and for the 2002 format of the series, albeit a modernised cover version. In one episode, James May recreated the tune using nothing but exhaust notes from several cars, while in another episode the tune in its full version was heard to be played over the radio when the three presenters tested in America (Series 12, Episode 2). At the end of the last episode of the 18th series of the show, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash played his version of the tune. \\"Jessica\\" is also used for most international versions of Top Gear, including the US version which used it as its theme only during the first season. The tune was also featured in the movies Field of Dreams, Did You Hear About the Morgans?, Fear and Lassie, and was used as the opening theme tune for the Dr. Dean Edell radio show.

History Bron Castell, High Street, Bangor c1905 St. Winifred's was founded on 3 May 1887 and named after the Welsh 7th century Saint Winefride. Its driving force and primary sponsor was the Honourable Eleanor Douglas Pennant, one of the daughters of Lord Penrhyn. Initially based in Bangor, north-west Wales, the school later moved to the small coastal town of Llanfairfechan, eight miles east of Bangor. The school was founded to fill the void of quality female education available at the time, and it primarily accepted boarders with a small number of day girls, all mostly from a middle- class background. Tuition was holistic: 'to provide, upon a sound and accurate system, a religious and useful education for the daughters of clergymen and professional men of limited means, and the agricultural and commercial classes generally' (taken from the first prospectus). The school was a member of the Midland Division of Woodard Schools, part of a UK body established by Canon Woodard to support teaching within an Anglican context. The school closed in c. 1968. Location The school was initially situated in three houses in Garfield Terrace along Garth Road, expanding to five as pupil numbers rose. The houses were not designed as or suited to being school accommodation, so the school subsequently moved to the grander 'Bron Castell' on the High Street. The continued success of the school resulted in the purchase of two houses opposite the site (known as Saint Cybi's and Saint Beuno's). Further increasing numbers resulted in a move to a purpose-built site in Llanfairfechan in September 1922, which consisted of separate accommodation, teaching facilities and chapel. The site of the school near the centre of the town is now occupied by modern housing, but is preserved in the name St Winifred's Close. References * Roberts, Nesta S.

It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Oria.  History  In classical times, Oria was known as Hyria (Uria) or Hyrium, a city in ancient Messapia and one of the principal Messapian cities. It was just north of the ancient town Manduria, at some distance southwest of Brundisium, and southeast of Taras/Tarentum; corresponding to the location of the modern town. A coin from Oria, Roman age, portraying Hercules. The castle. According to Herodotus (7.170), it was founded by the Messapians (who according to Herodotus were originally Cretans) sometime after the abortive siege of the Sicanian city Camicus. Messapians were probably of Illyrian origin. Between 217 and 84 BC the city was minting its own coins. The coins often feature Iapagus, the Iapygian national hero. Hyria was conquered by the Romans. It was destroyed in AD 924 and 977. In 1266, Oria was besieged by Manfred of Sicily. Main sights *Castle, mostly the result of modifications from the early 13th century under Frederick II Hohenstaufen and, later, under the Angevines, who added two cylindrical towers. *Gate of the Jews (Italian: Porta degli Ebrei). * Oria Cathedral: Basilica, built from 1750 over a pre-existing building damaged by an earthquake. The interior houses numerous paintings from the 17th to the 20th century. The exterior is commanded by the large polychrome dome. * San Domenico: church built from 1572. The interior has Baroque paintings, while also notable is the cloister of the annexed convent. * San Francesco d'Assisi * San Francesco da Paola: late 16th century church *San Giovanni Battista: church originally built in the 14th century but later included in a large Baroque edifice in the 17th century. *Grotto church of Madonna della Scala. *Bishop's Palace (16th century)  Jewish presence  Oria had one of the oldest Jewish communities in Europe. Jewish scholarship in Oria included the study of philosophy, the Talmud, languages such as Greek and Latin, and medicine and natural sciences. It was home to Shefatya ben Amitai and Shabbethai Donnolo, one of the first Hebrew writers who was native to Europe. Ten scholars in the community were killed when Arabs under Abu Ahmad Ja'far ibn 'Ubaid conquered Oria in 925. This was the beginning of the end of Jewish presence in Oria; the last relic was an epitaph produced in 1035. It is likely, however, that Jews were living in Oria until the 15th century.  People  Jewish scholar and writer Shabbethai Donnolo was born in Oria in 913. The neoclassisictic writer Francesco Milizia was born in Oria in 1725.

system board released by Taito Corporation in 2004. Based on commodity PC hardware architecture, Type X is not a specification for a single set of hardware, but rather a modular platform supporting multiple hardware configurations with different levels of graphical capability. This flexibility allows game developers limited choice in selecting a configuration to fit the game's specific requirements, and allows the platform as a whole to more efficiently support gaming titles with vastly different computing needs. For example, the Type X+ and Type X2 models have upgrade graphics processing power, which could be put toward better game visuals, or outputting to higher-resolution (HDTV) displays. The Type X7 board is used primarily for pachinko machines in Japan. Rawiya co-owned the company that produced this system board. Taito Type X and X7 use Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 Professional as the recommended development platform. The Taito NESiCAxLive add-on allows arcade owners to use a digital distribution system to download games.

These systems rely on ductwork, vents, and plenums as means of air distribution, separate from the actual heating and air conditioning systems. The return plenum carries the air from several large return grills (vents) to a central air handler for re-heating. The supply plenum directs air from the central unit to the rooms which the system is designed to heat. Regardless of type, all air handlers consist of an air filter, blower, heat exchanger/element/coil, and various controls. Like any other kind of central heating system, thermostats are used to control forced air heating systems. Forced air heating is the type of central heating most commonly installed in North America. It is much less common in Europe, where hydronic heating predominates, especially in the form of hot-water radiators. Types A modern forced-air heating furnace of the gas-fired variety. =Natural gas/propane/oil/coal= *Heat is produced via combustion of fuel. *A heat exchanger keeps the combustion byproducts from entering the air stream. *A ribbon style (long with holes), inshot (torch-like), or oil type burner is located in the heat exchanger. *Ignition is provided by an electric spark, standing pilot, or hot surface igniter. *Safety devices ensure that combustion gases and/or unburned fuel do not accumulate in the event of an ignition failure or venting failure. =Electric= *A simple electric heating element warms the air. *When the thermostat calls for heat, blower and element come on at the same time. *When thermostat is \\"satisfied\\", blower and element shut off. *Requires very little maintenance. *Usually more expensive to operate than a natural gas furnace. =Heat pump= *Extracts heat from the environment, using either the ground or air as the source, via the refrigeration cycle *Requires less energy than electric resistance heating and possibly more efficient than fossil fuel fired furnaces (gas/oil/coal). *Air source types may not be suitable for cold climates unless used with backup (secondary) source of heat. Newer models may still provide heat when coping with temperatures below 0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F). *A refrigerant coil is located in the air handler instead of a burner/heat exchanger. The system can also be used for cooling, just as any central air-conditioning system. *See Heat pumps =Hydronic coil= *Combines hydronic (hot water) heating with a forced air delivery *Heat is produced via combustion of fuel (gas/propane/oil) in a boiler *A heat exchanger (hydronic coil) is placed in the air handler similar to the refrigerant coil in a Heat Pump system or a Central AC. Copper is often specified in supply and return manifolds and in tube coils. *Heated water is pumped through the heat exchanger then back to the boiler to be reheated  Sequence of operation  # Thermostat calls for heat # Source of ignition is provided at the boiler # Circulator initiates water flow to the hydronic coil (heat exchanger) # Once the heat exchanger warms up, the main blower is activated # When call for heat ceases, the boiler and circulator turn off # Blower shuts off after period of time (depending on the particular equipment involved this may be a fixed or programmable amount of time) See also *Forced-air gas *Copper in heat exchangers * Forced Air Heating References Category:Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning ","title":"Forced-air"},{"id":"3615541","text":"The University of The Bahamas (UB) is the national public institution of higher education in the Commonwealth of The Bahamas with campuses throughout the archipelago. The main campus is located in the capital city of Nassau, on the island of New Providence. After more than thirty-five years of serving The Bahamas, first as a two-year institution, then as a four-year degree-granting College, the University of The Bahamas was chartered on November 10, 2016.  Overview  The University of The Bahamas has over 6,000 students and 12,000 alumni. It is one of the largest employers in The Bahamas, employing 700 faculty and staff. Seventy-six percent of the over 300 faculty (261 full-time and 96 part-time) are Bahamian. Established in 1974 by an act of the Parliament of The Bahamas, the College of the Bahamas was created through the merger of: * The Bahamas Teachers' College * The San Salvador Teachers' College, * The C. R. Walker Technical College - named for mathematics teacher Claudius Roland Walker * The Sixth Form Programme of the Government High School.  Campuses  COB Front Entrance Northern Bahamas CampusThe college has three academic campuses and several teaching and academic research centres throughout The Bahamas. The Oakes Field and Grosvenor Close Campus, housing the Division of Nursing and Health Sciences, are both in Nassau. The Northern Campus is near Freeport on Grand Bahama. The Northern Campus opened in 2011 as part of a planned university community 10 kilometers east of Port Lucaya and 15 kilometers east of Freeport. Operating initially with only the first two buildings, the campus will feature classrooms, faculty offices, library, computer and science labs, bookstore, cafeteria, conference room and administrative offices. Future development includes signature buildings, student and faculty housing, specialized instructional, academic and office spaces, commercial and dining spaces and athletic facilities. New facilities on New Providence are planned for: * The Small Island Sustainability Centre, housing multidisciplinary sustainability programs focusing on issues unique to small island economies * The Franklin Wilson Graduate Business Centre, housing The Faculty of Business, including both graduate and undergraduate Schools of Business Satellite campuses serve students throughout the archipelago in Abaco, Andros, Exuma and San Salvador. The college opened an agricultural location in Andros in 2014.  Institutes and Research Centres  The University's academic and outreach centres include: * The Centre for Continuing Education and Extension Services * The Abaco Center * The Exuma Center * The COB/Cape Eleuthera Institute * Oral History Institute * Confucius Institute * Agricultural and Marine Science Institute (2014) Research Centers include: Gerace Center Caving Research on San Salvador Island * The Gerace Research Centre for the Study of Archaeology, Biology, Geology and Marine Science is located on the shores of Graham's Harbour on the north end of San Salvador Island. The centre (formerly The Bahamian Field Station) is used as a base camp for over 10,000 annual scientific researcher and student expeditions. The centre is currently run by Dr. Troy A. Dexter. * The Bahamas Environmental Research Centre (BERC), located in central Andros, opened in 1995 as a collaborative effort with George Mason University in Virginia and the people of Andros. The BERC‚Äôs primary objective is to promote an understanding of current ecological issues. * The Marine and Environmental Studies Institute (MESI) is a multi-disciplinary research unit meeting national needs in scientific and technical research and community health. The institute was designed to build the nation's capacity for research, monitor marine and environmental resources and provide policy options for natural resource management. MESI partners with government ministries and international research institutions, provides leadership in program development in small island sustainability and provides year-round access to the unique sub-tropical ecosystems of the coastal, coral reefs, mangrove and sea grass communities in The Bahamas. * As part of a Sustainable Science Initiative (SSI), the Poultry Research Unit carries out research and training on sustainable tropical island agriculture and supports collaboration with counterparts with similar research foci and funding. The first phase was completed in 2004 with funding from the Freedom Foundation. The initiative is located on a site southwest of the Oakes Field Campus at the Gladstone Road Agricultural Centre in New Providence.  Harry C. Moore Library  Harry C. Moore Library Opened in 2011, the Harry C. Moore Library includes the law library, a 24-hour-a-day computer commons, auditorium, classrooms, media production studio, individual and group study spaces, institutional archives and exhibition spaces. The historical archives will serve as the de facto national library of The Bahamas, including the personal papers of Bahamian prime ministers. The library is named for American born Bahamian philanthropist Harry C. Moore (1913-2003).  Organization  The university is governed by the Council of the University of The Bahamas, chaired by Alfred Sears. The day-to-day operations are overseen by the president, who is appointed by the Council. = Senior administration = Key administrative personnel include: Investiture of President Betsy Boze * President, Dr. Rodney D.

The current President, Rodney Smith, was fired from the same institution in 2005 for using ‚Äúanother academic‚Äôs material without attribution‚Äù (plagiarism) during a student Convocation. This 2005 incident of Smith‚Äôs was so shocking that the then-Chairman of the Council Franklyn Wilson said that it would be a ‚Äúsignificant error for the country‚Äù if Smith was reappointed during an institutional presidential search in 2014. One of the defenders of Smith‚Äôs reappointment, former Bahamian Supreme Court Justice and current member of the Board of Trustees Ruby Nottage, claimed that the appointment process was transparent, open to public inquiry, and impartial. However, Ruby Nottage herself is not free from controversy. In 1986, she and her husband were indicted by a Boston grand jury of money laundering for a notorious Boston gangster.  Academics  The Oakes Field CampusThe university offers certificates and diplomas as well as associate, baccalaureate and master's degrees for 66 majors and serves over 5,000 students. In 2011, 66 percent of the graduates earned baccalaureate degrees, reflecting the change in student demand and the emergence of institution from college to university. Over 80% of entering students enroll in baccalaureate and masters programs. Pharmacy, law and other advanced professional degree programs are offered in partnership with Caribbean and U.S. universities. UB offers degrees through eight academic units, including an institute and seven schools. Six of the schools are organized into faculties (equivalent to colleges in U.S. universities) headed by an academic dean. The Academic Faculties (equivalent to Colleges) and their related schools are: * Faculty of Business ** School of Business * Faculty of Liberal and Fine Arts ** School of Communication and Creative Arts ** School of English Studies * Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences ** School of Chemistry, Environmental and Life Sciences ** School of Nursing and Allied Health ** School of Mathematics, Physics and Technology * Faculty of Social and Educational Studies ** School of Education ** School of Social Sciences * International Languages and Cultures Institute * Culinary and Hospitality Management Institute Athletics The Mingoes, as the University's athletes are known, compete nationally and internationally.

History  DS'70 was founded on 4 April 1970 as the result of a split from the Labour Party (PvdA). In June 1970, Frans Goedhart and Wybrand Schuitemaker, two members of the House of Representatives, left the PvdA and became members of DS'70 because of the anti-American position the PvdA had taken in the Vietnam War. They had previously been frustrated by its cooperation with other left-wing parties such as the Pacifist Socialist Party and its left-wing fiscal policy. In its declaration of principles (Beginselverklaring), DS'70 argued that whilst the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) lacked the comprehension of the necessity of social and economic reforms, the PvdA had acquired \\"anarchist\\" and unrealistic pacifist aspirations.http://www.rug.nl/dnpp/themas/beginselProgrammas/ds70/begprog2.pdf?as=pdf In the 1971 general election, the party won eight seats in parliament. After the elections, the party cooperated in the first Biesheuvel cabinet, together with the VVD, Anti Revolutionary Party (ARP), Christian Historical Union (CHU) and Catholic People's Party (KVP). The party supplied two ministers and two junior ministers, among them the party leader, Willem Drees jr, who became minister of Transport and Water Works. In 1972, the cabinet fell because of the opposition of DS'70 to the proposed budget. DS'70 ministers refused to accept budget cuts in their own departments. In the 1972 election, the party lost two seats, and it was confined to opposition to the PvdA-headed Den Uyl cabinet. Shortly after its foundation, two factions developed within DS'70, namely the social-democratic faction led by Jan van Stuijvenberg and the anti- communist faction led by Frans Goedhart. In 1975 this division led to a conflict. The party leader Willem Drees Jr. was seen as conservatively social- democratic, lacking a willingness to reform and the ability to oppose the Den Uyl cabinet fiercely. However, Drees won the conflict, and a group of prominent members left the party. In the 1977 general election the party was left with only one seat which it lost at the 1981 general election. In 1983, the party was officially dissolved.  Ideology  DS'70 saw itself as a social-democratic party. Its founders thought that the mainstream Dutch social-democratic party PvdA was becoming too radical in its economic and international policy and that the New Left was having too great an impact on the PvdA. DS'70 was a fiercely anti-communist party. It supported the American involvement in Vietnam, NATO cooperation and a strong defence policy. The party was economically liberal, supporting a balanced budget. It also supported strong economic growth. One of its main issues was battling inflation, therefore the party wanted to restrict government spending and implement the principle of profit for many government services. The DS'70 was aware of the problems of migration in urban areas; the party wanted to restrict the migration of Dutch citizens from Surinam. However, the party did support a modern natural environmental policy with strong public transport and restrained automobile use. It thought that economic growth and sustainability were compatible. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the party became more socially conservative, emphasizing family values and civic society. However, the party still saw itself as a social-democratic party focusing on solidarity and community solutions.  Linked organisations  DS'70 lacked the links with other societal organisations that many Dutch parties had. The party magazine was called Political Bulletin of DS'70, and since 1978 Buitenhof (Outer Court, in contrast with the Inner Court, the nickname of the buildings of the Dutch parliament and government). Its youth organisation was the Social Democratic Youth Active.  Important figures  Willem Drees Jr. was party leader between 1971 and 1977. He was minister of Transport and Water Works and lijsttrekker (top candidate) in the 1971, 1972 and 1977 elections. Drees lost the last two elections and was criticized for his alleged solistic behaviour and lack of charisma. He was the son of former Prime Minister Willem Drees. His father left the PvdA during the 1970s, but he did not join his son's party. At the beginning of the 1980s, the famous Dutch chess player Max Euwe featured as a DS'70 lijstduwer in the elections for the House of Representatives.  Electorate  The party was supported by former PvdA, VVD and Democrats 66 voters and undecided voters. The party was mainly supported by middle-class voters (e.g. civil servants).

The line was built in stages from 1878, reaching Mount Somers in 1885. A further section to Springburn was added in 1889; this closed in 1957, followed by the rest of the line in 1968. A portion has been preserved as the Plains Vintage Railway. Construction Unlike many other rural branch lines in New Zealand, this line was not built for the sole purpose of opening up land for agriculture, as there were significant deposits of lignite coal and limestone in the hills behind the town of Mount Somers. Construction commenced in May 1878, with the line leaving the Main South Line at Tinwald, the southernmost suburb of Ashburton. With the onset of the Long Depression looming, the construction work on the line provided valuable employment, and as it was built, it was progressively opened. The first 13.39 km to Westerfield were opened on 15 April 1880, followed by Anama, 30.9 km from the junction, on 3 October 1882, and then Cavendish on 1 March 1884, 35.02 km from Tinwald. Although it had been decided to terminate the line on the south bank of the South Ashburton River, another 2.58 km was built to Mount Somers, opening on 4 October 1885. An extension of 5.57 km to Springburn was opened on 9 September 1889, bringing the line to its full length to 43.17 km.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 75. In 1886, a privately owned narrow-gauge bush tramway was built into the hills behind Mount Somers to serve coal mines and a limeworks. This line operated until 1963, though after 1943 it was closed beyond the limeworks.John Yonge (editor), New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 24.  Stations  The following stations were on the Mount Somers Branch (in brackets is the distance from the junction at Tinwald): * Lagmhor (8.13 km) * Westerfield (13.39 km) * Hackthorne (17.92 km) * Punawai (21.69 km) * Valetta (26.56 km) * Anama (30.9 km) * Cavendish (35.02 km) * Mount Somers (37.6 km) * Buccleugh (?? km) * Springburn (43.17 km) Operation For roughly half a century a daily mixed train operated on the line. Besides coal and limestone, important commodities on the line were grain, livestock, and silica sand that was railed to a glassworks in the Christchurch suburb of Hornby, served by the Southbridge Branch. At one point in the 19th century, as tractors displaced horses on farms in the area, substantial traffic came from the transport of horses to the North Island, where the terrain was too steep for tractors of the era to handle. As road transportation improved in the 20th century, the line's importance slipped. Passenger traffic, in particular, had markedly declined from a peak of 18,000-25,000 passengers per annum in the late 19th century, and as it was no longer viable the passenger service was withdrawn on 9 January 1933. World War II generated increased traffic for the line, especially as there was a military camp located in Westerfield, but after the war ended conditions returned to their pre-war status. In 1951, the freight trains were reduced to twice a week and they now commenced in Ashburton rather than at the branch's terminus. Closure of the short section to Springburn had been suggested as early as 1930 and this finally occurred on 29 March 1957, with full closure of the line on 1 January 1968.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 75-6. Wheat was railed from Valetta until April 1968. The first 2.5 kilometres of the line from the junction at Tinwald to the Frasers Road crossing survive as The Plains Vintage Railway & Historical Museum. The branch today Some of the formation, including embankments and cuttings, survive, while in other places it has been obliterated, often by farming activity. Goods sheds survive at Mount Somers, along with a couple of loading banks, and at Valetta, where some ballast is still in place on the formation of a siding. The site of the Westerfield yard retains a couple of loading banks, there are bridge abutments at various points, and about a kilometre from Westerfield School a couple of sleepers can be found.Leitch and Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, 76-7.

He was a senior elder of Kakadu National Park and a traditional owner of the Bunitj estate in northern Kakadu, perhaps the most spectacular National Park in Australia. His decision to open up this land to other people was instrumental in the creation of Kakadu National Park. He was usually called Big Bill Neidjie because of his physique and physical strength, probably gained through his time working on the luggers, and was also called Kakadu Man, after the title of his first book. He was born at Alawanydajawany on the East Alligator River around 1920 into the Bunitj clan of the Gagudju people. His father was Nadampala and his mother was Lucy Wirlmaka, from the Ulbuk clan of the Amurdak people. He grew up leading a traditional lifestyle in the East Alligator region, and was taught by his father, his grandfather, and others how to hunt and manage his environment. From about the age of 20 he worked first with buffalo hunters, then at a timber mill, and then on board a lugger transporting people and goods along the North Coast of the Northern Territory and to remote island communities. He was initiated at a ceremony at Ubirr in the early 1940s. During the Second World War he helped in the defence of Australia, working at the radar station at Cape Don. He was in Darwin during the Japanese bombings in 1942 and helped Aboriginal people during and after the devastation. Big Bill was instrumental in the decision to lease his traditional lands to the Commonwealth of Australia so that it could be managed as a wild area and as a resource to be shared by all Australians. After helping establish Kakadu as a National Park in 1979, he returned there to commit the rest of his life to supporting the joint management of the Park. Kakadu continues to be governed by a board with a majority of indigenous Australians. In 1988, Kakadu was featured in the February issue of The National Geographic Magazine, and was the focus of the National Geographic television documentary entitled Twilight Of The Dreamtime, in which Big Bill figured prominently. His son, Jonathan Yarramarrna appeared with him and parts of the film dealt with the future of Kakadu and specifically with Big Bill's preparation for Jonathan to assume the custodianship of his family's tribal lands. In 1989 he was awarded the Order of Australia for his services to conservation. In many Indigenous Australian cultures, there are traditional secrets passed down from generation to generation, and it is taboo to reveal these secrets to a non-initiate. As he grew older, Bill Neidjie realised that he might be in the position, as one of the last Gagudju initiates, of taking these secrets to the grave with him, and so made the courageous decision to break this taboo, so that his culture might live on. In addition to entrusting some of the custodianship of tribal lands to his son Jonathan, he related many of his stories to the anthropologist Stephen Davis and others, and published two books, in which he related his passion for the land of which he was part, and insisted on the importance of managing the land in the traditional ways. He hoped that, one day, his culture might thrive once again, and his grandchildren, or their grandchildren, might pick up the threads once more. Bill Neidjie died on 23 May 2002. The Federal Minister for the Environment and Heritage, David Kemp, said, \\"He was instrumental in the establishment of Kakadu National Park and was deeply committed to sharing his love for his country, his respect for the heritage of his country and his indigenous culture with countless thousands of park visitors and all who shared his love for the natural world.\\" Notes References  Rev. edns 1986‚Äì Australia's Kakadu man, Bill Neidjie.

It belongs to the Thenkurissy panchayat. Remarked by the tradition and the popular folk ritual kanyarkali. Majalur Samudiri palace now demolished was the venue for holding Krishnattam kali. Manjalur was the only place in the world to hold this 10 day ballet of Krishnas life, with the exception of Guruvayur temple. Kaankku Veedu Family was the de facto ruler's of this area Geography and religion Land of some of the very old temples. The religious beliefs are pretty strong in this part of the area. The home goddess is 'Shree Chirathura Bhagavati'(ChirThura Muthi-‡¥ö‡¥ø‡¥±‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡µÅ‡¥± ‡¥Æ‡µÅ‡¥§‡µç‡¥§‡¥ø). The other main temples in the locality are Manjalur Ayyappan Kavu (‡¥Ö‡¥Ø‡µç‡¥Ø‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µª ‡¥ï‡¥æ‡¥µ‡µç) & Shree Dura Devi Kshethram (‡¥¶‡µÅ‡µº‡¥ó‡µç‡¥ó‡¥æ‡¥¶‡µá‡¥µ‡¥ø ‡¥ï‡µç‡¥∑‡µá‡¥§‡µç‡¥∞‡¥Ç).

Before its Autonomous status, the school was frequently named by the Ministry of Education (MOE) as the 'Best Non-Independent and Non-Autonomous Secondary School' in Singapore. TK was presented the 'Ministry of Education's School Excellence Award in 2007, which recognises \\"excellence in both education processes and outcomes\\". The school celebrated its Diamond Jubilee - 60 years of establishment in 2016. History TK students on a field trip The school's Assembly Plaza = Tanjong Katong Secondary Technical School (1956-1993) = The school was first opened in 1956 as Tanjong Katong Secondary Technical School, accepting boys only. In 1969 the school began to take in female students, and in 1970, new centralised workshops, science laboratories and classrooms were constructed. By 1979 the number of students had risen to 5,000. The school was renamed Tanjong Katong Secondary School in 1993. = Tanjong Katong Secondary School (1993-) = The school was renamed Tanjong Katong Secondary School in 1993, and in 1996 the school acquired the premises of the neighbouring Tanjong Katong Girls' School. Two years later, the school moved to its new premises at 130 Haig Road 550 metres away. The following year, TKSS was one of the pioneering schools to be awarded the Sustained Achievement Award when the award was first introduced. The opening ceremony of the new campus was held in 2000. The school became one of the Top 20 Value- Added schools in 2001. In 2003, it was presented with the Sustained Achievement Award for Value-Added. In 2004, the school achieved a 98% distinction rate for Chemistry in the GCE 'O' Level examinations. In 2004 the school was accorded Autonomous status. Following the new status came the School Distinction Award; the school was one of the pioneer 12 schools to be given the award. Another addition that year was the presentation of Singapore Quality Class status in recognition of the efficient organisation of the school. The academic curriculum in the school was recognised when it received the Best Practice Award for Teaching and Learning. Other areas were recognised with the achievements of Sustained Achievement Awards for Physical Fitness, Uniformed Groups and Value-Added. As a result, Tanjong Katong Secondary School is prominently known throughout the country for its excellent curriculum. TKSS was presented the School Excellence Award in 2007 and 2011, making it one of eight schools to receive the honour.  Culture  = Crest = Scientist and artist Leonardo Da Vinci is featured on the school crest depicting an 'all- round' education. The bird and the flying machine on the crest represent a desire to go beyond the realms of ordinary education. = Houses = The four houses, named after Albert Einstein, Leonardo Da Vinci, Rabindranath Tagore, and Ernest Rutherford, are represented by the colours red, purple, blue and yellow respectively. Year 1 students are sorted into houses by class. The results from interhouse sports and academic competitions are summed up in a yearly points system. House allocations used to be student-based, instead of class-based.however, since 2020,there are no longer houses in tk. =Uniform= TK uniform (2005) Boys wear white short-sleeved shirts with a school badge on the breast pocket. Lower Secondary boys wear white short trousers. Upper Secondary boys wear white long long trousers. Girls wear a short-sleeved blouse with the school badge on the left. The skirt is jade- green with box pleats. A green and yellow striped tie is worn on some occasions. School Building The picture of the old building of Tanjong Katong Secondary School A possible reason behind the incorporation of an octagonal structure in the school's building can be related to Leonardo da Vinci's obsession on octagons and the school's association with him. The current building of Tanjong Katong Secondary School (year 2017) Student life =Principal's Honours List= The Principal's Honours List (PHL) was developed in tandem with TK's mission in nurturing students to their fullest potential. Students on the PHL are regarded as the top students of the skill that embody the values of the school and epitomises the TK Graduate. Students on the PHL strive to be role-models in both academic and non academic arenas. = Leadership Development Opportunities = A select 15 PHL students will form the panel of the CCM Grant, a programme by the National Youth Council . As the CCM Panelists, they will be assessing community service project grant applications supported by their peers. Year 4 PHL students will attend an annual mass training on Effective Communication and Presentation Skills. Band practice An inter-class sports event Tanjong Katong Band The TK Band has its roots in the school bands of former Tanjong Katong Technical School (now Tanjong Katong Secondary School) and Tanjong Katong Girls' School. The bands started separately in 1965 with only 26 members. In 1967, the two bands came together for a combined performance that marked their long relationship. The band split again in 1989, with TKGS going its own way. Since established, it has represented the republic in several overseas events and International Bands' festivals. In 1998, the band was invited to put up a solo performance in the National Day Parade (NDP), the first ever for any school band. It also appeared on National Day Parades 2002, 2004 (during the pre-parade segments in both years), NDP 2012, Chingay Parades, etc., in solo performances. In 2014, TK Band was invited to play at the Taoyuan Band Festival in Taiwan (Republic of China). TK Band was also invited to play at the Singapore Youth Festival Opening Ceremony 2014 held at Gardens by the Bay. Other The school also has a computer club and a girls Tanjong Katong Floorball team, and a choir that in 2011, as part of the annual Jubilate Festival of Choirs, participated in a choral exam by the London College of Music.

It first appeared in Turkey in 1553. The work was essentially a comprehensive analysis of sixty-four different persecutions that the Jewish people had suffered since antiquity. Hardly an insular text, it made use of Latin sources as well. It also had a certain anthropological value, as Ibn Verga discussed the customs and practices of Jews in various lands. Ibn Verga also sought to highlight what he felt were the faults of his people, and as such, much of his criticisms of the Jews are exaggerated for effect. In many ways the Scepter of Judah was the first and most significant work of Jewish historiography; it was essentially the first time that such a comprehensive interest had been expressed by the Jews in their past. Ibn Verga sought to clarify the problem of anti-Jewish sentiment, which had manifested itself in the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. According to the author, the expulsion from Spain and Jewish exile in general were natural phenomena that were subject to historical forces of causation and explanation. They were not simply \\"punishment\\" for the sins of the Jewish people, as had been the time- honored way of explaining such misfortunes. The text posited the view that the hatred of the Jews is a popular inheritance which is passed from generation to generation. It is occasioned by religious fanaticism (as had been the case in Spain) and is compounded by envy and jealousy; it also stems from a lack of education. Ibn Verga also suggested that there was perhaps too much flaunting of opulence amongst the Sephardim; certain festivities had been too extravagant, which had raised antagonism and jealousy amongst Catholics. Whether this was actually the case is debatable. The Scepter of Judah was one of the most popular Jewish history books of all time, perhaps the most popular until the 19th century.

It is now the SLAF Koggala, used for domestic flights and for military purposes.  History  Koggala Air Force Base Koggala squadron mechanics 1944 Prior to the Second World War, the lake at Koggala was used for seaplanes. After the Japanese occupation of the Malay Peninsula in 1942, the RAF needed a new seaplane base. In March 1942 RAF Koggala consisted of forty people, one PBY Catalina flying boat and no outlet to the sea from the lagoon. Within a month more than a hundred more personnel arrived (mostly ex-Singapore) and construction began on establishing the water runway and the requirements for a large flying boat base. (slip ways to take boats out of the water, cover etc) and by the end of 1942 there were over 800 personnel at the base. It became the largest flying-boat base in the east. The RAF flew Consolidated PBY Catalinas and Short Sunderlands initially No. 205 Squadron RAF and No 413 Squadron RCAF and later on of No. 202 Squadron RAF, No. 204 Squadron RAF and No. 230 Squadron RAF. A Catalina of 413 Squadron operating from Koggala located the fleet of Admiral Chuichi Nagumo on 4 April 1942 off the coast of Ceylon. Two Sunderlands from Koggala rescued a group of wounded Chindits from Burma in June 1944. PBY Catalina being flown from RAF Koggala, 1944 After the loss of Singapore by the British, the QEA/Imperial Airways flight from London to Sydney lost Singapore, its refueling point between Calcutta and Perth, Western Australia. It was vital to the British/Australian war effort that the flight be maintained at any cost, so an alternate route was established through Koggala. In 1943 205 Squadron reestablished a link, flying direct from Koggala lake to the Swan River at Perth, on what was at the time the world's longest non-stop air route.Using Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boats each flight carried three passengers, and of mail. At 28 hours, the flight was so long that the passengers saw the sun rise twice, and it came to be called the 'flight of The Double Sunrise'. The first flight arrived from Perth on 30 March 1943; the last flight was on 18 July 1945. The service was later taken over by QEA (now Qantas) and Imperial Airways with the Catalinas replaced by civilianised Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Avro Lancastrian aeroplanes. After the war the airport began to develop as a land base. A tarmac runway was laid down and Air Ceylon operated services to and from Koggala by Douglas DC-3 Dakota aeroplanes. In 1964, the Dakotas were replaced by Avro 748 and Nord Aviation 262 aircraft. These services were terminated following the closure of Air Ceylon in 1978. Koggala continued as a Sri Lanka Air Force base. The current runway is capable of handling domestic aircraft like the Dash-8 and ATR-72. The Government of Sri Lanka expects to upgrade the Koggala airport to international standards as an alternative airport to the BIA. The feasibility study, by a U.S. agency, has been completed.

(2003) \\"Thomas Leer\\", in The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, He formed the punk band Pressure, but by 1978 had moved on to music influenced by synthpop and Krautrock bands such as Can. That year, he self-financed his debut single, \\"Private Plane\\". Although it was recorded in his own flat and was only issued in 650 copies on his own label, it gained significant attention, with NME naming it \\"Single of the Week\\". (It was also included in the fantastic compilation album Business As Usual, on Cherry Red/CRI.) In 1979, he released the album The Bridge in collaboration with Robert Rental. In 1981, he signed to Cherry Red, his first release for the label being the 4 Movements EP. After two further releases on the label, he was signed by Arista Records, releasing three further singles and his debut full-length solo album, The Scale of Ten in late 1985. Two years later, he formed the duo Act along with ex-Propaganda singer Claudia Br√ºcken, signing to ZTT Records. The duo released four singles (including the minor UK hit \\"Snobbery and Decay\\") and an album, Laughter, Tears and Rage, before splitting up, with Br√ºcken pursuing a solo career. Leer retired at this point, but returned in 2003 with a new album and in 2009 on the track \\"Tonight\\", from the Stefano Panunzi album A Rose and continues to be musically active.

Playing career Hunt started his career with Queens Park Rangers. He has also played for Gillingham, Sittingbourne, Hong Kong Rangers and in Singapore. In December 1998, Hunt made his debut for Bohemians at Turners Cross against Cork City. Hunt quickly established himself as a dominant force in the League of Ireland, helping to steer a struggling Bohemians side away from relegation. The following season, Bohemians came close to the league title and losing in the FAI Cup Final in a replay to Shelbourne. The following season, 2000‚Äì01, Hunt became club captain and led Bohemians through the greatest season in its history. In the early season Bohemians progressed in the UEFA Cup, with impressive results including victories in Scotland against Aberdeen and in Germany against Kaiserslautern, before guiding the club to its first league title since 1978. One week later, Hunt led the team out in Tolka Park for the FAI Cup Final, which Bohemian won, capping a historic Double for the club. While the 2001‚Äì02 season was disappointing for the champions, Hunt earned a runners up medal in the FAI Cup. Hunt won his second league winners medal as Bohemians, leading the league from start to finish. He was also voted the League's Player of the Year for 2003 at the FAI's annual awards ceremony.

Iota Horologii b has a minimum mass 1.94 times that of Jupiter; however, preliminary astrometric measurements suggest that the object may be around 24 Jupiter masses and would therefore be a brown dwarf. Detection and discovery The discovery of Iota Horologii b was the result of a long-term survey of forty Solar analog stars that was begun in November 1992. The planet represents the first discovery of an extrasolar planet with a European Southern Observatory instrument, with the data found at the La Silla Observatory in Chile. The Keplerian signal found the planet to have an orbital period of 320.1 days, indicative of an orbiting planet with minimum mass of 2.26 Jupiter masses. Iota Horologii b was announced in the summer of 1999 as the first planet found by a team of planet hunters led by Martin K√ºrster. The measurements of Iota Horologii show that the planet orbits the star approximately every 320 days. From this period, the known mass of the central star (1.25 solar masses)https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso0809a/ and the amplitude of the velocity changes, a mass of at least 2.26 times that of planet Jupiter is deduced for the planet. It revolves around the host star in a somewhat elongated orbit. If it were located in the Solar System, this orbit would stretch from just outside the orbit of Venus (at 117 million km or 0.78 astronomical units [AU] from the Sun) to just outside the orbit of the Earth (at 162 million km or 1.08 AU). Because the planet is at least 720 times more massive than the Earth, it is predicted that Iota Horologii b is more similar to planet Jupiter. In recent astrometric analysis of Iota Horologii b suggests that planet b may have as much as 24 times the mass of Jupiter with an inclination of 5.5 degrees from Earth's line of sight. With this calculations, Iota Horologii b may actually be an extremely dim brown dwarf and a substellar companion of Iota Horologii. However, these measurements were later proved useful only for upper limits of inclination.

The director may also help to stabilise the club ‚Äì many examples exist of director stepping in as a caretaker manager on the departure of the manager. The director ‚Äì often an experienced football figure ‚Äì may also positively advise a less experienced manager or the board of a less well developed club. In contrast, there are many examples of tensions arising between director and manager, often due to questions over the remit and powers of the two positions; particularly with regard to control over transfer policy. This had led to many well publicised and often, highly damaging disputes within clubs. In general, directors of football are not shareholders in the club, or hold a nominal stake. This is opposed to other members of the board with whom the director of football will sit. While most common in association football, professional gridiron football teams often have a similar director of football operations or vice president of football operations position, who serves as the second in command to the general manager or team president. As a figurehead The level of power and influence in the day-to-day and transfer operations of the club held by a director of football may vary considerably. In some cases, the position may be as a figurehead or as a club ambassador, with transfer dealings, team affairs, squad selection and day-to-day operations handled exclusively by the manager and his staff. Often, the position in this case is filled by a former famous player. Bobby Charlton at Manchester United is such an example. In such a case, the role of the director of football has more to do with club promotion and marketing than with actual control over footballing operations. Employing a well-known football personality in such a position may also be used to enhance the perceived prestige of the club, improving the club's position in the transfer market. Tension may arise even in this role between manager and director, even if the director is merely a figurehead ‚Äì should the role be filled by a former (often successful) manager, the presence of that individual within the club may act to undermine the authority of the present manager and act to add pressure during periods of poor performance (for example, from the fans wishing the return of the director to managerial duties). The presence of Sir Matt Busby at Manchester United as general manager after retirement is generally considered to have undermined his immediate successors in the 1970s, despite his retirement from day-to-day club affairs (although he did return to the manager's seat on an interim basis 18 months after his original \\"retirement\\".'Ambassador' Ferguson wins United battle of wills The Independent, 14 July 2001 Other well known managers have been promoted to director of football or similar roles, including Ron Greenwood at West Ham United in 1974, when first team duties were handed over to coach John Lyall. However, Greenwood returned to frontline management three years later with the England national football team. In January 1994, Lawrie McMenemy returned to Southampton nearly a decade after resigning as manager to become the club's first director of football, a role which he held for more than three years, although the actual management of the team was left to Alan Ball, Dave Merrington and finally Graeme Souness. In March 2002, Harry Redknapp stepped down as director of football at Portsmouth after a year in the role to succeed Graham Rix as manager. Appointments in this case are often long-term, likely due to the negative reaction of fans to the removal of a former club legend. On occasion, the role has been filled until the death of the director ‚Äì such as the aforementioned Busby, who remained as a director of Manchester United until his death in January 1994 at the age of 84. Others remain in the role until their health restricts their activities. A notable case is Bob Paisley at Liverpool, who after his retirement as manager in 1983 he was given a seat on the board of directors and held this role until 1992, when at the age of 73 he resigned from the club due to the onset of Alzheimer's disease, four years before his death. As a technical director In this case, the director of football may be sought by a board ‚Äì or even manager ‚Äì in order to provide advice or technical assistance on footballing or other aspects that are perceived as lacking or desired by the club. This may be the case where the manager is inexperienced or perceived as naive in a particular aspect, allowing the director to advise against potentially costly errors. This may also be the case where a club in a lesser league or lower division with ambitions to develop further and improve their league position seeks an experienced former manager or director from a more prominent league or club in order to use their experience to further the club. Such an example is that of Giovanni Trapattoni at Red Bull Salzburg or Sven-G√∂ran Eriksson at Notts County. In this case, however, the tag \\"director of football\\" may be dropped in order to prevent the \\"director\\" from undermining the present manager by his presence at the club with the person taking up a position such as with the youth academy perceived as subordinate to the manager. Appointments in this case are often short term ‚Äì for between 1/2 seasons ‚Äì with the director imparting their advice and departing to another club. As a go-between In other cases, the role of the director of football may include control over transfer dealings and targets and aspects outside coaching and squad selection, which are handled by the manager. The director may oversee all levels of the club ‚Äì youth to first team ‚Äì with the manager dedicated to first team affairs. Often, a director in this case is a former manager or experienced former coach, often a predecessor of the present manager. This type of director is often installed at the behest of the owners of a club to oversee the manager and act as a go-between of the board and managerial team, or if required help select a new manager. However, such an arrangement has led to controversy in English football due to issues over roles and responsibilities of manager and director ‚Äì either perceived excessive interference of the director in affairs (such as squad selection) beyond his remit or by attempting to control and criticise aspects of management. A notable recent example of such tension is that of manager Kevin Keegan and director of football Dennis Wise at Newcastle United. An example of the description of the role in this case as from the perspective of the manager is given by Dave Bassett as: :\\" ..... a buffer. The director of football is answerable to the board but there to assist the manager. He's experienced in football and there to help the board members who don't have that experience.\\" Length of appointments in this case are often linked to the fortunes and tastes of the manager and board ‚Äì directors often departing after the sacking of a manager (for example, Damien Comolli at Tottenham Hotspur) or on appointment of his replacement. On occasion, the director may remain through a number of managers, such as David Pleat. As a general manager In the most extreme case, the director of football may act in a role similar to the continental club 'sporting director' or general manager; holding control over transfer policy and targets, team affairs, stadium and training affairs, travel, fixture selection and having input into squad selection and day-to-day club affairs. This is generally confined to the 'sporting' side of the club, with marketing and financial aspects handled by another director or executive. However, rarely is such a position referred to as 'director of football', with 'sporting director' or akin preferred. The director of football's job is sometimes compared to that of a general manager in a North American professional sports organisation, and often referred to as 'sporting director' or some equivalent in continental Europe. In a structure with a powerful director of football, the position of manager may be officially called 'head coach' or 'head of 1st team affairs' in order to more clearly define the remit of the traditional 'manager' and 'director of football'. In this case the length of appointment is intrinsically linked to on-pitch performance, in the same way as a manager.

The show was produced by Banksia Productions in South Australia for the Nine Network. 500 episodes were produced. History Banksia Productions produced the popular children's series Here's Humphrey from 1965. The company planned to add some science segments in 1971 and sought assistance from the South Australian Institute of Technology. Rob Morrison and Deane Hutton were selected as presenters and the segments were introduced as Humphrey B Bear's Curiosity Show. After positive reception from the audience, Banksia Productions and the Nine Network agreed to produce a spin-off series. Planning commenced with the working title The F Show.According to Hutton, the working title resulted from the single word uttered by producer Ian Fairweather when told he was to make a science show for children. Until the early 1970s, children's television was aimed at younger children. The broadcasting regulations were changed to require a proportion of programmes to be aimed at school-age children, broadcast after school hours. This prompted the creation of the Curiosity Show as a separate show. Format From 1972 to 1980 the format was a 60-minute show presented by Morrison, Hutton, Ian Fairweather, Alister Smart, Belinda Davey, Gabrielle Kelly, Dr Mark Dwyer and Lynn Weston. The emphasis was on science but also included general craft and music. Producers were Neil Smith, Kate Kennedy White (1978‚Äì79), James Lingwood (1980) and Ian Smyth. From 1980 the show was reduced to 30 minutes, presented by Morrison and Hutton, with emphasis on science, nature and the environment. The Curiosity Show won many national and international awards, including the coveted Prix Jeunesse in 1984, voted by peers from around the world as the best factual program for children. The program placed a strong emphasis on practical demonstrations of various science topics, and included activities such as floating a ping-pong ball on a stream of air, recreating historical devices, setting off a room full of mouse traps, the science of musical instruments and freezing objects with liquid nitrogen. Commonly, segments presented scientific concepts in the form of tricks and puzzles. Many segments described a sequence of steps to build something out of common household materials with longer builds invariably ending with the phrase \\"here's one I prepared earlier\\" so as to keep the segment moving. Hutton's catchphrase, after presenting a hypothesis he postulates the audience may be curious about, was to declare \\"well, I'm glad you asked,\\" before responding to the hypothesis. The use of household materials was deliberate, in order to demystify science and ensure that children, wherever they lived, could make what they needed rather than rely on buying it, and this proved popular with the young audience who could easily replicate the demonstrations at home. Morrison suggested that they should always show what they had made working so that children would know that their own constructions would work if made properly and also to show the limitations of the constructions to dispel any overambitious expectations. Both Morrison and Hutton always told viewers to get their parents' permission before building things or conducting experiments, especially if it involved the use of sharp objects such as knives or scissors or the use of flames or hot or dangerous liquids. Spin offs Four companion books were available in 1981 produced by Jacaranda Press containing scientific explanations and instructions for experiments for children to perform at home. Each of the books was themed upon one of the four Western classical elements of earth, air, fire and water. Together, Hutton and Morrison published 11 books, including Supermindstretchers, The Arrow book of Things to Make and Do and String for Lunch (Ashton Scholastic). Morrison published more than 40 additional books which included material from The Curiosity Show, including Nature in the Making, A Field Guide to the Tracks and Traces of Australian Animals (the first such field guide in Australia and still the only one to deal with all taxa), Clever and Quirky Creatures, It's Raining Frogs and Fishes. and many more for the school reading programs of various publishers. Morrison's Field Guide to Tracks and Traces and a segment he had prepared for The Curiosity Show on dingo]s at Uluru, led to his involvement in the Morling Royal Commission inquiry into the Chamberlain convictions. He gave evidence on dingo and dog tracks and conducted various forensic investigations on dingo gapes and behaviour. His collection of specimens and artifacts from the trial have been acquired by the National Museum of Australia. The Children's Television Workshop wanted to make a version of the Curiosity Show using American scientists as presenters. Rob Morrison and Deane Hutton were consultants in the early planning stages. PBS did not think that middle-aged scientists would engage a young audience (despite the popularity of the format in Australia) and insisted that any science show be hosted/presented by young people. CTW eventually reworked the concept into 3-2-1 Contact. In 2014, The Curiosity Show produced a brief online series which was available on YouTube. It was co-hosted by Morrison and Hutton again. YouTube channel In 2013, the show's former hosts, Hutton and Morrison, announced they had purchased the remaining rights to the show for an undisclosed sum, from Banksia Productions which had gone into liquidation. On July 12, 2013, in conjunction with producer Enabled Solutions, they launched a YouTube channel to make the episodes and segments available for a new generation of viewers. There are some 5,000 segments, and some have attracted significant audiences, especially in the United States and India; , one segment about self-starting syphons had been viewed more than a million times. In May 2014, Hutton and Morrison released, on the YouTube channel, the \\"Curiosity Show's first new episode since 1990\\". The online production was funded with the assistance of Kellogg Australia. The episode followed the original format of the programme, supported by extra internet resources, with Hutton and Morrison performing experiments related to cereal, including making homemade cornflakes and cornflour non-Newtonian fluid. The episode was praised by the channel's followers.

Early years Kolker was born in Quincy, Illinois.  Career  Kolker, like fellow actors Richard Bennett and Robert Warwick, had a substantial stage career behind him before entering silent films. He began acting professionally in stock theater in 1895. On stage he appeared opposite such leading ladies as Edith Wynne Matthison, Bertha Kalich and Ruth Chatterton. Kolker began acting in films in 1925. He is best remembered for his motion picture appearances and for appearing with Barbara Stanwyck in the ground-breaking Pre-Code film Baby Face (1933) as the elderly CEO of the company whom Stanwyck's character seduces. Another well remembered part is as Mr. Seton, father of Katharine Hepburn and Lew Ayres in the 1938 film Holiday directed by George Cukor. Kolker entered films as an actor in 1915 and eventually ended up trying his hand at directing. Kolker's best known directorial effort is Disraeli (1921), starring George Arliss which is now a lost film with only one reel remaining. Prints however are said to exist in Europe and Russia.  Personal life and death  Kolker was married to Lillian Carroll; they divorced in 1926. Soon after the divorce, he married Margaret Bruen.

Under his direction, the Valero Bank, founded in 1848 by his father Jacob, acted as catalyst in the development of the Jewish community under Ottoman rule. The bank's capital and financial services were employed in the acquisition of land and building, helping transform Jerusalem and nearby townships from stagnation and poverty towards the modernization of the 20th century. Background At the start of the 19th century Jerusalem was a small, poverty stricken town on the margins of the Ottoman Empire. It was fought over by the world's great powers for centuries, but other than its special significance for the three great world religions, the city was of no particular importance. Trade was scarce and there was no real industry other than small-scale production of soap, olive oil and religious souvenirs. In the first half of the 19th century all the town's population lived within the walled city. Poverty was pervasive, housing poor, living conditions hard, the streets narrow and neglected. Even within the walls, a third of the city was a wasteland, covered in thickets of prickly pear cacti. No one lived beyond the city walls and whole surrounding area was fertile ground for criminal gangs. At sunset the city gates were locked. Haim Aharon's father, Jacob Valero (1813‚Äì1874), was of Spanish-Jewish origins (Sephardic), whose ancestors were forced out of Spain by the Spanish Inquisition in the late 15th century. His family migrated to the Ottoman Empire and Jacob was born in Istanbul. He received a traditional Jewish education and as a young man (in the early 1830s) migrated to Ottoman Syria and settled in Jerusalem. Jacob Valero married Esther Aziza Levi and had three children. Initially he worked as a butcher, but after a while switched to money changing, which went from strength to strength. In collaboration with Haim Amzalak (another Sephardic Jew), Gavriel (some say Yehuda) Papu and Jacob (Giacomo) Pascal (an Armenian in the employ of the Austrian consulate - a ‚Äòsilent‚Äô partner), he founded in 1848 the first bank in Palestine, named Jacob Valero & Co. The main branch was located in the Old City close to the Jaffa Gate, in a small two room flat. With the expansion of its operations, a branch was opened in the port of Jaffa, directed by his eldest son Joseph (1837‚Äì1879) and the bank also had representation (possibly another branch) in Damascus. Outline of his private and professional life Haim Aharon was born in Jerusalem in 1845. He benefitted from a broader education, including five languages: French, Turkish, Arabic, Hebrew and Ladino (the language spoken by the Jews of Spain). At the age of fifteen he started working as clerk in the bank run by his father and by 1875 became the manager of the Jerusalem branch. By this time the bank had no other partners. In 1880, after the death of his older brother Joseph, he became director of the bank. Haim Aharon Valero was married to Simha Papu and had seven children with her. After she died at the age of 38, he married his niece, Miriam Valero, and had two more children. He died in 1923 and was buried at the Mount of Olives cemetery. Public Activities His activities and wealth soon earned Haim Aharon an important standing in the city, both in the Jewish and the wider community. His education and mastery of different languages were critical to Haim Aharon's ability to perform his various roles in the social, commercial and political spheres. He served as the representative of the Jewish community with the city authorities, under the tutelage of the Ottomans, but amongst his friends Haim Aharon counted many of the local Arab residents, including several of the leading Arab families. Between 1831 and 1841, after the conquest of Jerusalem by Egypt, he served as member of the district management committee. This enabled him to extend his business and social networks and in 1868 he was appointed as one of two Jewish representatives on the Jerusalem municipality. In the mid 19th century the population of Jerusalem was 13,000, of whom 5,000 were Jews, mostly Sephardic and Oriental. By the 1880 the Jewish population trebled with the majority being Ashkenazi (of European descent). Rivalries characterized the different Jewish communities, who ran their own separate organizations. For many years the Jerusalem Sephardic community was led by the Sephardic Community Council, normally headed by senior rabbis who served as official representatives of the community with the Ottoman authorities. Jacob Valero was nominated to the Council in 1870, the first person not a rabbi to bear the title ‚ÄòPresident of the Kollel‚Äô. He handled the committee's financial affairs and came to be known as ‚Äòtrustee of the poor‚Äô. His eldest son continued this activity, to be followed in the 1880s by Haim Aharon. Haim Aharon was one of the representatives of the Moses Montefiore Memorial Trust, founded in 1874 with the aim of housing Jerusalem Jews. The trust made loans for building in Mazkeret Moshe (1882), Ohel Moshe (1882), Yemin Moshe (1892), Zichron Moshe (1904) and Kiryat Moshe (1924). He supported a number of charitable causes, including the donation of land on Jaffa Street for the building of a Sephardic old people's home, opened in 1908. The Valero Bank The early operations of the bank consisted of financial services for the local community: deposits, loans, transfers. The bank was the main conduit for the transactions of the Pekidim and Amarkalim of the Holy Land organisation (literally: \\"clerks and agents\\" in Hebrew), a Dutch-Jewish society based in Amsterdam and dedicated to the distribution of charity funds collected in Europe for the Old Yishuv (Halukkah). The bank's clientele expanded along with its services, to include consulates, churches, other religious institutions and charities. It acted as agent for the Ottoman administration as well as Austrian, German and Russian governments. It also had the status of correspondent with the Rothschilds of Paris, London and Vienna (the √ñsterreichische Credit-Anstalt), the Samuel Montagu & Co. bankers of London and Banque Russe pour le Commerce √âtranger in Paris. When Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria-Hungary visited Jerusalem in November 1869 (en route to the opening of the Suez Canal), the bank handled the transfer of funds required to cover the costs of the trip. Jacob Valero was subsequently awarded the Order of the Iron Crown. In his ‚ÄòJerusalem Memory Book‚Äô (1913), Nahum Dov Freiman assessed the resources of the Valero Bank at 3,000,000 francs (¬£120,000). The bank made a significant contribution to the economic development of the city and played a significant wider role in the transfer of funds from Europe to a wide range of Jewish organizations. Financing the Russian construction The strategy of the Czar of Russia to expand the influence of the Russian Empire led to a steady increase in the number of Russian pilgrims to Jerusalem in the second half of the 19th century. The Czar, who saw himself as defender of Eastern Orthodox Christianity, sought a foothold in the city. In October 1860, the Russian government acquired a large plot and work started on what was then the largest construction project in Jerusalem. The walled Russian Compound, as it is known until this day, comprised a church, hospital, the residence of the Russian consul and hostels for pilgrims. The bank helped realize the project through the transfer of funds and other banking services and in recognition of this, in 1888 the Czar honoured Haim Aharon Valero with the Order of St. Anna. Links with the Rothschild family The Valero bank provided a range of services to the Rothschilds, a very prominent family of European bankers based in Vienna, Paris and London. Haim Aharon developed close business contacts with Baron Edmond James de Rothschild. When the baron, as patron of Jewish settlement activity, began substantial investment in Jewish community of Ottoman Syria in the 1880s, he was assisted by the bank through transfers and deposits. There was a strong social connection too ‚Äì when visiting Europe, Haim Aharon and members of the family stayed as personal guests of the Rothschilds. Acquisition of land Over the years of the bank's contacts within the spheres of finance and real estate, the bank gained titles of land, often through defaults on loans made for land purchases in various parts of the country. At the same time Haim Aharon also made his own land purchases in Jerusalem including many plots along Jaffa Street, at the Damascus Gate, in the suburbs that are today Katamon and Mekor Chaim, as well as in the towns of Hebron and Jaffa. Yeshayahu Press described Haim Aharon as ‚Äòthe Rothschild of Jerusalem‚Äô. A number of important buildings were erected on land acquired from the Valero family, including Bikur Cholim Hospital and the Mahane Yehuda market (which was originally named the Valero Market). In the latter part of the 19th century the bank faced competition from European banks, which by then established a growing presence in Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem. The bank finally closed in 1915 with the onset of the First World War. Haim Aharon died eight years later. Haim Aharon Valero Square At a cost of over $2.-Million, the Valero compound ‚Äì a chaotic parking lot that houses the city's annual Succot \\"lulav and etrog market\\" ‚Äì is being redeveloped into an urban square. The project, designed by architects Rachel Weiner and Vered Singer, is being carried out by the Jerusalem municipality's Eden Company with funding from the municipality and the Transportation Ministry. The new Valero Square, illuminated by decorative lighting and surfaced in granite and limestone, will provide both shade and sitting corners for Mahaneh Yehuda shoppers as well as serving as a venue for cultural events. The square preserves the memory of Jacob Valero (1813‚Äì1874), the founder of the first private bank in Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem, Jacob Valero & Company, and his son Haim Aharon Valero (1845‚Äì1923), who was also a banker and served as head of the city's Sephardi kollel. The alley bordering the new square on the north is named after Haim Valero. See also Aaron Valero (1913‚Äì2000), grandson of Haim Aharon Valero, Israeli physician and educator.

The film is inspired by the true story of the numerous female homicides in Ciudad Ju√°rez and tells the story of an inquisitive American reporter sent in by her American newspaper to investigate the murders. Lopez also recorded a song for the film entitled Porque La Vida Es Asi. Plot The opening titles explain that American corporations are using the North American Free Trade Agreement by opening large maquiladoras right across the United States‚ÄìMexico border. The maquiladoras hire mostly Mexican women to work long hours for little money in order to produce mass quantity products. Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez), an impassioned American news reporter for the Chicago Sentinel wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war. Instead, her editor George Morgan (Martin Sheen) assigns her to investigate a series of slayings involving young maquiladora factory women in a Mexican bordertown. Worker Eva (Maya Zapata), originally from the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, takes a bus to go back to her shanty-town home after work. After a while she is the last passenger still in the bus. The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes. Adrian heads to Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent. In Ju√°rez, Adrian meets up with Diaz (Antonio Banderas), whom she had been working with six years before, and who is now the editor for the local newspaper El Sol de Ju√°rez. She also meets Eva. The three try to find the two killers and have them prosecuted. For this purpose Adrian starts working in the factory in order to act as bait on the bus ride. The driver tries to assault her in the same way he did Eva, and although police assistance has been arranged, they are at the wrong place. She manages to escape her attacker. Later Diaz gets shot and killed in a drive-by shooting. Eva changes her mind and does not want to testify any more for fear of revenge, and tries to flee to the U.S., together with others in the trunk of a car. She gets caught and is sent back. Adrian convinces her to testify after all. For political reasons the Chicago Sentinel refuses to publish Adrian's story. Adrian quits and becomes the editor for El Sol de Ju√°rez. Cast * Jennifer Lopez as Lauren Adrian: reporter for the Chicago Sentinel, and daughter of Mexican immigrants. * Antonio Banderas as Alfonso Diaz: founder of newspaper El Sol. * Maya Zapata as Eva Jimenez: factory worker and rape survivor. * S√¥nia Braga as Teresa Casillas: founder of an organization trying to help the women in Ju√°rez. * Teresa Ruiz as Cecila Rojas: a young factory worker. * Juan Diego Botto as Marco Antonio Salamanca: son of the extremely rich Salamanca family, owner of one of the maquiladora. * Zaide Silvia Guti√©rrez as Lourdes Jimenez: Eva's concerned mother. * Rene Rivera as Aris Rodriguez: rapist. * Irineo Alvarez as Domingo Esparza: bus driver and rapist. * Martin Sheen as George Morgan: Lauren's boss. * Randall Batinkoff as Frank Kozerski: Lauren's co-worker and friend. * Kate del Castillo as Elena Diaz. * Juanes as himself Production =Background= The motion picture is based on a series of unsolved murders in Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, a large Mexican border city across the R√≠o Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande) from El Paso, Texas.Summers, Chris. BBC News, \\"Hollywood Tackles Mexican Mystery\\", September 10, 2006. When Gregory Nava first heard about the murders in Ciudad Ju√°rez he wanted to do something. He said that his vision became to tell the stories through \\"an exciting thriller-drama\\".Gerson, Daniela. Spiegel International, from Berlinale, February 15, 2007. Nava approached Jennifer Lopez to do the film in 1998 and she was receptive. Lopez said, \\"Since first hearing of these atrocities in 1998, when Gregory Nava came to me with this project, I desperately wanted to tell this story. I began working to ensure we made this film in order to bring the attention of the world to [the] tragedy and to pressure the Mexican government to bring to justice those responsible for these horrible crimes.\\"Mainichi Daily News. \\"Lopez to receive award from human rights group for Bordertown,\\" entertainment article, February 3, 2007. Director Gregory Nava and executive producer Barbara Martinez-Jitner believed that the film would bring strong reactions. Nava has said the production received threats against himself and the cast. Also, there was stolen equipment and intimidation of film crew members when they filmed in Mexico. According to Martinez-Jitner, when they first filmed in Ciudad Ju√°rez, the police began threatening locals who were helping the production. They also began stalking the crew. A camera truck was vandalized and $100,000 worth of film equipment was stolen. Bordertown places the blame for the murders upon the Mexican government, the United States and the maquiladora assembly plants that were brought rapidly into existence by the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nava said, \\"[When] there are very powerful forces involved, you're going to be attacked. I expect the Mexican government to get very upset about it.\\"Johnson, Reed. Los Angeles Times, \\"Mexico's murdered women find a voice in 'Bordertown': A new film casts blame on both sides of the border for the scandal that is Ciudad Ju√°rez\\", February 14, 2007. =Screenplay= The inspiration for the story, according to Nava, was the work of Guatemalan writer Miguel √Ångel Asturias, the magic realism of novelist Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and the social dramas of England's Charles Dickens. He also said the screenplay was a return to an El Norte type of screenplay (Oscar nominated). In El Norte he created a screenplay from many of the interviews he conducted. He did the same in Bordertown. =Financing= Mobius Entertainment, the production company, borrowed money to complete the project from the New Mexico State Investment Council (NMSI) but was late in paying back the loan in March, 2006.Amedeo, Michael. Ibid. A second $12.65 million loan could be called in by NMSI before its November, 2007 due date because of the late payments. The second loan calls for zero interest because the state of New Mexico will take ten percent of any profits the film might make. Film producers said the delay of payment was due to filming taking longer than expected. At one point the film was in development with both New Line Cinema and MGM.Showbizdata film data base. =Filming locations= Filming locations include: Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the United States; and Nogales, Sonora, Ciudad Ju√°rez, Chihuahua, and Mexicali, Baja California, in Mexico. Distribution The picture was first presented at the Cannes Film Festival on May 18, 2006, and again at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 15, 2007, before being released to theatres. Reception =Box office= The movie was released in theaters internationally only, starting in Germany on February 22, 2007. The film ended up grossing $8,327,171 worldwide.http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=intl&id;=bordertown.htm It was released straight-to-DVD in the United States on January 29, 2008. =Critical response= Kirk Honeycutt, writing for The Hollywood Reporter, did not like the film: \\"It wants to be a thriller, a piece of investigative journalism, a political soapbox and a vehicle for Jennifer Lopez. It serves none of these masters well.\\" Honeycutt also said the screenplay is full of plot holes and outlines some of them in his review of the film.Honeycutt, Kirk . The Hollywood Reporter, (via Reuters), \\"Jennifer Lopez lost in ludicrous Bordertown, February 15, 2007. According to media reports, the audience reacted with a mixture of \\"boos and muted applause\\" when the film finished screening.El Universal. \\"'Bordertown' Booed at Berlinale\\", February 16, 2007. The film was also criticized for a gratuitous musical performance and cameo by the Colombian recording artist Juanes, seen by many as pandering to a Latino audience.Spiegel Online. \\"Canta Juanes a muertas de Ju√°rez\\", June 21, 2005. Variety magazine film critic, Leslie Felperin, had a problem with some of the arguments made in the film, namely: that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the exploitation of Mexican labor directly led to the killing of many women in Ciudad Ju√°rez. Felperin wrote, \\"Possible co-factors or causes of the real crime spree, such as rife drug-related criminality, domestic violence largely ignored by the authorities, and the possibility that at least some of the culprits may be U.S. citizens crossing the border to kill for kicks, are not explored here.\\" As for the film, Felperin calls the movie \\"only fair-to-poor\\".Felperin, Leslie.

Cricket career Dell was a fast-medium seam bowler who made his debut against England for the vital Seventh Test at Sydney in the 1970‚Äì71 Ashes series. With Australia needing to win he opened the bowling with Dennis Lillee and took 2‚Äì32 in the first innings ‚Äì John Edrich caught by Greg Chappell for 30 and Basil d'Oliveira bowled for 1 ‚Äì as England collapsed to 98‚Äì5 and 184 all out. In the second innings he was the best bowler with 3‚Äì65, but England made 302 and 223 was too much for Australia to make for victory. Dell batted last and made 3 not out in each innings and so was present at the crease when The Ashes were lost. His five wickets (19.40) put him ahead of Dennis Lillee (8 wickets at 24.87) at the top of the series averages, if you exclude Ian Chappell's one wicket for 10.00.

It is generally considered risk- free as it is based on the application of a mathematical equation rather than chance.  Concept  The concept of matched betting requires an account with two or more bookmakers or betting exchanges where at least one offers the user a free bet. When the free bet is placed the other bookmakers or betting exchanges are used to hedge all the possible outcomes so that no matter what happens the value of the free bet is retained. At its simplest, a matched bet involves placing a back bet using the free bet at a bookmaker while placing the opposing lay bet at a betting exchange. More advanced versions involve placing the bets on multiple bookmakers (dutching) to avoid the commission charged for using an exchange. Generally, bookmakers incorporate terms by which bettors must first place a bet using their own money in order to qualify for the free bet. For this, a bet is placed on particular results occurring with the bookmaker and a second bet placed on the same result not occurring at the betting exchange. The latter is required to offset any loss in the event that the result does not occur; for instance, if a team loses. Once the free bet has been qualified, the same process is followed with the exception that a free bet is being used. No matter which result occurs, there will always be a guaranteed profit because the bet was made free of charge. Online betting outlets, betting exchanges, have become popular in recent years for they allow betters to bet without official odds-makers. In essence, the person placing the lay bet acts as a bookmaker.  Approaches  There are several common strategies for matched betting including assisted and manual betting. Assisted matched betting refers to websites or software packages which provide comparison tables of markets for individuals to bet on. These are commonly known as 'auto-matchers'.  Industry reactions  Matched betting is legal and a spokesperson for William Hill has indicated that the betting industry does not have a problem with this use of free bets.  Matched betting services  The growth of matched betting has led to the formation of matched betting services - usually subscription-based businesses established to make the process easier with step-by-step instructions and bespoke software, such as oddsmatching.  Taxation  Matched betting, along with all other betting, is tax-free in the UK and in Italy.

A fighter is a versatile, weapons- oriented warrior who fights using skill, strategy and tactics. Fighter is a generic and broad class; individual fighters have diverse backgrounds and different styles. Bodyguards, adventurers, former soldiers, invading bandit kings, or master swordsmen are all fighters, yet they come from all walks of life and backgrounds and often find themselves on very different alignments, goals, and sides in a conflict. Publication history =Dungeons & Dragons= The \\"Fighting Man\\" was one of the three classes in the original Dungeons & Dragons game; the other two classes were Magic-User and Cleric.Gygax, Gary, and Dave Arneson. Dungeons & Dragons (3-Volume Set) (TSR, 1974) The paladin was introduced in Supplement I - Greyhawk (1975), as a subclass of Fighting Man.Gygax, Gary and Robert Kuntz. Supplement I: Greyhawk (TSR, 1975) =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition= The fighter was one of the standard character classes available in the original Player's Handbook. The fighter was presented as one of the five core classes in the original Players Handbook. In the 1st edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, fighters were the class best suited for physical combat, balanced by the weakness of not having any other ability. Fighters did not typically greatly benefit from high intelligence, wisdom or charisma ability scores; the character could obtain higher scores in strength, dexterity and constitution, which increased combat ability. High hit points (HP), the ability to equip strong armors, and easily the fastest THAC0 progression also helped them in combat. As an optional and very commonly used rule, fighters could also take Weapon Specialization, which offered further bonuses to hit and damage. In the Players Handbook, the fighter's hit dice improved to a d10. =Basic Dungeons & Dragons= The fighter was available as a character class in the game's \\"Basic\\" edition. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition= The fighter, as part of the \\"warrior\\" group, was one of the standard character classes available in the second edition Player's Handbook. The second edition Player's Handbook gives several examples of famous fighters from legend: Hercules, Perseus, Hiawatha, Beowulf, Siegfried, Cuchulain, Little John, Tristan, and Sinbad. The book also cites a number of great generals and warriors: El Cid, Hannibal, Alexander the Great, Charlemagne, Spartacus, Richard the Lionheart, and Belisarius. The Complete Fighter's Handbook detailed the fighter class, and several subclasses. The book made an attempt to compensate for this class' lack of special abilities. In addition to offering a variety of kits such as the Swashbuckler, Gladiator, and Noble Warrior the handbook introduced several skills that allowed players to customize their warriors' combative abilities. New rules included group weapon proficiencies, continuing specialization, additional rules for unarmed combat, and the introduction of four different fighting styles (Single Weapon, Two Weapon, Weapon and Shield, and Two Handed Weapon). =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= In the 3rd edition of the game, the mechanics behind fighters were significantly changed by turning most of their abilities into combat feats from which the fighter could choose some as bonus feats,Advanced Dungeons & Dragons, 3rd Edition at GamesFirst! Retrieved on December 3, 2008. allowing fighters to choose between a variety of combat techniques more specialized than brute force. Typical fighters in 3/3.5 D&D; are sophisticated warriors with a variety of tactics. Fighters did not undergo major overhaul in the 3.5 revision of Dungeons & Dragons compared to 3rd edition. The main change was the addition of the Greater Weapon Focus and Greater Weapon Specialization feats (which both increase their attack power with the selected weapons) becoming exclusively available to fighters. 3.5 has seen additional focus on increasing the depth of the fighter's feat trees, as these are the primary (indeed, only) class feature of fighters. In 2006 the release of the Player's Handbook II greatly increased the number of feats available to fighters as well as provided a number of abilities, similar to the Weapon Specialization ability, that were only available to higher level fighters. While the impact on the popularity of the fighter class remains to be seen, initial reaction from the fan community has been positive. =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= The fighter is a core class in 4th edition, and like all other classes uses the new power system where they are classified as having a martial power source. The fighter's role is that of a defender, which involves high hit points, good defensive capabilities and the ability to protect other party members from enemies. Unlike the other core defender, the paladin, the fighter cannot heal allies and has more limited ranged combat capabilities, but has greater damage dealing and mobility control abilities. Two fighter builds are presented in the Player's Handbook: the Great Weapon Fighter, which focuses on offense, and the Guardian Fighter, which focuses on defense. Martial Power presents two more builds: the Tempest Fighter, which uses two light weapons, and the Battlerager Fighter, which uses axes and hammers and has greatly enhanced resilience in the form of temporary hit points. Fighter attack powers are generally weapon-based and use Strength for attack rolls, although they also have a number of powers which benefit from Dexterity, Wisdom or Constitution. Some fighter attacks have an additional benefit if used with weapons from a specific group, such as axes, spears or light blades. Dungeons & Dragons Essentials The Essentials rulebook Heroes of the Fallen Lands presented two alternate versions of the Fighter, the Knight and the Slayer. The Knight focuses on defense, while the Slayer focuses on both offense and defense. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The fighter has been included as a character class in the 5th edition Player's Handbook. Players may choose from one of three Martial Archetypes at third level: Champion, Battle Master, and Eldritch Knight. Each is intended to provide a different flavour to the base fighter class: the Champion archetype focuses on simplistic power, the Battle Master focuses on a unique resource that is used to empower weapon flourishes known as maneuvers, and the Eldritch Knight offers limited access to magic. Later published supplements expanded upon the fighter class by granting additional options for these subclasses. The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide supplement adds the Purple Dragon Knight to the Martial Archetype options, which focuses upon assisting and supporting allies. The later supplement Xanathar's Guide to Everything adds the Arcane Archer, Cavalier, and Samurai as player options. The Arcane Archer uses a unique resource of magically-empowered trick shots, the Cavalier focuses on mounted combat, defending their allies and marking foes for engagement, and the Samurai focuses on resilience, swift strikes, and social interaction. Non-player character Outside of the player base classes, in 3rd edition the Warrior class is a simplified and weakened version of the fighter, intended to be used as a non-player character, as town guard for example.  Reception  Screen Rant rated the fighter class as the 2nd most powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition. The Gamer rated the 5th edition fighter subclass Samurai as the 10th most awesome subclass out of the 32 new character options in Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything. Gus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \\"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D; Beyond from\\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, fighters were the most created at 13,906 total. Human (4,888) was the most common racial combination followed by dwarf (2,009) and then dragonborn (1,335). Wezerek wrote \\"when I started playing 'Dungeons & Dragons' five years ago, I never would have chosen the game‚Äôs most popular match: the human fighter.

It was established by the Papua and New Guinea Act 1949 of Australia, which provided for the combined administration of the Territory of Papua and Territory of New Guinea under the United Nations trust territory system. It had the power to make Ordinances for the \\"peace, order and good government\\" of the territory, subject to the assent of the Australian-appointed Administrator. The Legislative Council initially consisted of 28 members and the Administrator: sixteen \\"official members\\" representing the Territorial administrator, three non-official elected members, three non-official members \\"representing the interests of the Christian missions in the Territory\\", three non-official native members, and three other non-official members. As a result, it was considered to be largely dominated by the Australian administration. The first elections were held in 1951, with the first council sittings beginning in November 1951. In the first elections, there were only 664 people on the electoral roll in Papua, 537 on the New Guinea mainland and 496 in the New Guinea islands, with \\"not much more than half of those enrolled\\" voting. The Australian administration surrendered its majority in reforms in 1960 following international pressure for decolonisation, which increased membership to 37: 14 nominated officials, 12 elected members and 10 non-elected members, at least five of which were required to be indigenous. It was abolished in May 1963 and replaced by the House of Assembly of Papua and New Guinea (with effect from 1964) following a United Nations Trusteeship Council report that had recommended the establishment of a parliament in the territory.

It was not considered very important when it was first introduced in the 1930s and development was allowed to languish. By the time it was developed enough for production use, other engines, often British-derived, had surpassed it in performance. The design was later converted to a turboprop, the T35 and still later sold to Wright Aeronautical, where it saw some interest for use on what would become the B-52 Stratofortress, before that design moved to jet power. The J37 and T35 were built to the extent of a number of testbed examples but never entered production. Design and development In 1930, Nathan C. Price joined Doble Steam Motors, a manufacturer of steam engines for cars and other uses. Over the next few years he worked on a number of projects and starting in autumn 1933 began working on a steam turbine for aircraft use. The engine featured a centrifugal compressor that fed air to a combustion chamber, which in turn fed steam into a turbine before exiting through a nozzle, powering the compressor and a propeller. The engine was fitted to a test aircraft in early 1934, where it demonstrated performance on par with existing piston engines except for difficulty maintaining power at higher altitudes due to the compressor. Work on the design ended in 1936 after Doble found little interest in the design from aircraft manufacturers or the Army. Price started work on his own turbojet design in 1938, although this initial design was far more complex than what eventually emerged as the J37. In an effort to keep the fuel efficiency of the engine similar to existing piston engine, Price used a combination of low-compression axial compressor stages feeding a high- compression reciprocating compressor. In 1941 he was hired by Lockheed to evaluate the General Electric superchargers being fit to the experimental XP-49, a high-altitude version of their famous P-38. By this time Price had the basic design of his jet completed and was able to attract the interest of Lockheed's Chief Research Engineer, Kelly Johnson, who would later found the company's famous Skunk Works. Johnson had been thinking about a new high-speed design after running into various compressibility problems at high speed with the P-38 and the jet engine seemed like a natural fit in this project. During 1941 he ordered the development of a new aircraft to be powered by Price's engine, developing the engine as the L-1000 and the aircraft as the L-133. Later that year the Tizard Mission arrived in the US and presented many technological advances being worked on in England, including information on Frank Whittle's jet engine designs. Rumors of similar work in Germany and the well-publicized flights in Italy suggested that practically everyone but the US was working on jets and getting a design of their own suddenly took on the utmost importance. Vannevar Bush, Tizard's counterpart in the US, decided the best course of action was to simply license the British designs. A committee under the direction of William F. Durand was set up to put the British designs into production and build an aircraft to test them. These projects emerged as the General Electric J31 powering the P-59 Airacomet. On 30 March 1942, Lockheed submitted proposals for the Lockheed L-133 and L-1000 to the US Army Air Force's development division at Wilbur Wright Field. By this point the original design proved too complex and had evolved into a new design replacing the pistons with a set of three centrifugal stages, with intercooling between each of the stages. The main combustor was a \\"canular\\" type with twelve flame cans in an annular container, feeding their exhaust to a five-stage axial turbine. For additional thrust, fuel could be sprayed between the turbine stages. To fine-tune performance at different altitudes, the compressor and turbine stages were coupled using a variable-speed hydraulic clutch. The design called for a weight of 1,700 lb (775 kg) and a sea level thrust of 5,100 lbf (22700 N). By November 1942 the design had been further refined, with the weight settling at 1,610 lb (735 kg) and the combustion area using chrome-steels. The Army remained uninterested and Lockheed apparently started getting cold feet. Nevertheless, on 19 May 1943 Price agreed to start a more radical redesign at the urging of Wright Field. He produced a much simpler design consisting of two sixteen-stage axial compressors with a single stage of intercooling between them. The first four stages of the frontmost compressor remained clutched to allow them to operate at optimum speed. For testing purposes the compressor blades had no airfoil shaping and were attached to the central hub on rotating mounts to allow their angles to be changed between runs. The turbine was reduced to four stages. The low-pressure compressor was encased in a two-part cylindrical casing with stiffening ribs, which gave it an odd appearance similar to the bottom of an egg carton. The shorter high-pressure compressor was similarly encased but with ribs running front-to-back only. Power was taken off between the two compressor stages to power accessories, with the gearbox placed on the top of the engine outside of the compressor casings. In June 1943 the Army eventually demonstrated their interest in a Lockheed jet design but contracted for the P-80 Shooting Star, to be powered by a licensed version of the centrifugal-flow Halford H.1. They remained interested in the L-1000 as well and sent out a long-term development contract under the name XJ37-1 in July 1943 with the first delivery on 1 August 1945. However, when the war ended the first example was only about two thirds complete. Some of the work had been contracted out to Menasco Motors Company and at the end of the year the entire mechanical side of the project was turned over to them. The XJ37 was being worked on at the same time as competing Westinghouse axial-flow designs undergoing development, the 19A and 19B, were being test-run through the 1943-45 period, resulting in America's first production axial-flow turbojet engine, the Westinghouse J30, of which some 260 examples were made for the earliest American military jets for the U.S. Navy, and for the first American delta-wing fighter design, the Convair XF-92. The first engine was finally ready for operation in 1946. The Army contracted for another four examples. Around this time a turboprop version was proposed, the XT35 Typhoon. This was a fairly simple adaptation of the J37, adding a fifth turbine stage at the rear of the engine, containing a radial turbine that drove the pusher propeller and exited the exhaust around the outer rim of the engine. An alternate arrangement would send the exhaust through an opening in the propeller boss. In September 1947 Lockheed finally threw in the towel and sold the design to Wright Aeronautical. At the time the Army (soon to be US Air Force) was in the process of developing a new truly intercontinental bomber. Given engine and airframe technology at that time it appeared that the only way to build such an aircraft would be to use turboprops and Wright was interested in capturing that market. In June 1946 Boeing proposed their Model 462 to fill the requirement, featuring six T35 engines, later reduced to four in a series of redesigns. However, by 1948 advances in airframe design, particularly the introduction of the swept wing, allowed the bomber to move to jet power, eventually leading to the B-52 Stratofortress. Work on the J37/T35 continued until July 1953, by which point three engines had been delivered to the USAF. The Air Force turned over the engines and all collected data to the industry as a whole. No further interest was forthcoming and the project ended after an estimated $4.5 million (~30 million year 2000 dollars) had been spent. References = Notes = = Bibliography = * Kay, Antony.

He is the author of eight novels, including notably the semi-autobiographical Patrick Melrose novels. In 2006, Mother's Milk was shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Personal background and education Edward St Aubyn was born in 1960 in London, England, into an upper-class family. He is the son of Roger Geoffrey St Aubyn (1906‚Äì1985), a former soldier and a surgeon, and his second wife, Lorna Mackintosh (1929‚Äì2005). On his paternal side, he is great-great grandson of Sir Edward St Aubyn, 1st Baronet, and great-nephew of The 1st Baron St Levan. On his maternal side, he is grandson of Captain Alastair William Mackintosh of the Seaforth Highlanders (briefly married to Constance Talmadge 1926‚Äì1927), and Lela Emery (later Duchess of Talleyrand). Through the latter he is great-grandson of American businessman John Josiah Emery, Sr., and great-nephew of John J. Emery, Jr. and Audrey Emery (wife of Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia). His father was first married to Sophie Helene Freifrau von Puthon of Schloss Mirabell in Salzburg, whom he divorced in 1957. St Aubyn has two half-sisters by his father's first marriage, and an elder sister, Alexandra. He grew up in London and France, where his family had houses. He has described an unhappy childhood in which he was repeatedly raped by his sexually abusive father from the ages of 5 to 8, with the complicity of his mother. St Aubyn attended Westminster School and in 1979 went on to read English at Keble College, Oxford. Although at the time a heroin addict, he graduated, but with a pass, the lowest possible class of degree. He entered psychotherapy at the age of 25 and subsequently became a professional writer. From 1987 to 1990, he was married to the author Nicola Shulman, now The Marchioness of Normanby. St Aubyn has two children, and lives in London. Patrick Melrose series Five of St Aubyn's novels, Never Mind, Bad News, Some Hope, Mother's Milk, and At Last, form The Patrick Melrose Novels, the first four of which were republished in a single volume in 2012, in anticipation of the fifth. They are based on the author's own life, growing up in a highly dysfunctional upper-class English family, dealing with abuse at the hands of his father, the deaths of both parents, alcoholism, heroin addiction and recovery, and marriage and parenthood. The books have been hailed as a powerful exploration of how emotional health can be carved out of childhood adversity. Mother's Milk was made into a feature film released in 2011. The screenplay was written by St Aubyn and director Gerald Fox. It stars Jack Davenport, Adrian Dunbar, Diana Quick, and Margaret Tyzack in her last performance. In 2018 a five-part television series, Patrick Melrose was broadcast, a joint production of Showtime and Sky Atlantic. Benedict Cumberbatch stars as Patrick Melrose (with the young Patrick played by Sebastian Maltz), with each episode based on a different novel in the series. The series premiered on Showtime on 12 May 2018 to favourable reviews.

The approach taken by the team is to offer these individuals an emotional resort, which is where Sen's character plays her part. Her role is to act as a friend and a lover for the patient, but at the same time, refrain from any emotional involvement on her own part as her role is purely that of a nurse who is helping the patient recover. She has to repeatedly break the emotional attachments that she experiences because as a nurse, she is a part of therapy.

Benaud is the son of Louis and Irene Benaud (both deceased). His only sibling was fellow cricketer Richie Benaud (deceased), who was older by 13 years. John is married to Lindsay Benaud with two children. His son Jamie Benaud was born in 1971; he is a firefighter and Hazardous Materials Technician/Specialist with the NSW Fire Brigades. John's daughter Nicole was born in 1973 while Benaud was playing on tour in the West Indies. Nicole is a TAFE teacher. Benaud has lived in the Blue Mountains since 1971. John began his working career at Fairfax's Sydney Sun newspaper as a copy-boy. He was subsequently awarded a journalism cadetship and his career progressed at the paper where he remained for his entire working life. By the time the Sun was closed in 1988 following the disastrous takeover by Warwick Fairfax, Benaud had risen to be the editor-in-chief of the paper. Throughout the 1990s Benaud wrote cricket columns for Australian, British and Indian sports magazines and ghost-wrote several autobiographies. In 1997 he released the book Matters of Choice, the story of his time as an Australian cricket selector. Benaud played first-class cricket for New South Wales for six years, from 1966/67 to 1972/73, becoming captain of the State side. While Captain of the NSW team, Benaud was famously suspended for a month after refusing to obey the ban on Adidas Grass-sports shoes. The public and media outcry forced Cricket NSW to overturn their decision, and in the off-season the ban was lifted. He represented Australia in the summer of 1971/1972 playing against Gary Sobers' Rest of the World XI. He was selected for three Tests in 1972 to 1973. He made his Test debut in the 1st Test against Pakistan at Adelaide over Christmas 1972, making little contribution as Australia won easily. He also played in the 2nd Test at the MCG over the New Year, which Australia won again. He made the top score of 142 in the second innings, in the knowledge that he had been dropped for the 3rd Test. He returned for his third and final Test appearance in the 5th Test against West Indies at Port of Spain, Trinidad, in April 1973. He contributed little with the bat, but bowled four overs to take 2-12 in a drawn match. He was later a selector for the Australian cricket team. The 20-year gap between Richie's and John's Test debuts is the longest for two brothers. He wrote the book Matters of Choice: A Test Selector's Story, which was published in 1997.

Biography Borchard was born in Moscow to German parents, and grew up in Saint Petersburg where he received a solid musical education, as well being a regular visitor to the Stanislavsky Theatre. In 1920, after the Russian Revolution, he emigrated to Germany. Otto Klemperer engaged him as his assistant at the Kroll Opera in Berlin (Klemperer, lacking confidence in his own abilities, expected Borchard to critique his conducting technique). He conducted the Berlin Philharmonic for the first time in January 1933. In 1935, he was banned by the Nazi regime as politically unreliable. He continued teaching at his apartment and received his friends, including Boris Blacher and Gottfried von Einem.Friedrich, Ruth-Andreas. Der Schattenmann ‚Äì Tagebuch Aufzeichnungen 1938-1945.

During World War II he remained in Berlin as a Resistance activist under the name Andrik Krassnow, during which time his duties included contact with Ludwig Lichtwitz, a specialist in false identity papers. Memorial, Berlin-Steglitz, Germany On 26 May 1945, two and a half weeks after Germany's unconditional surrender, he conducted the Berlin Philharmonic at the Titania Palast cinema, in a concert featuring the Overture to Mendelssohn's A Midsummer Night's Dream, Mozart's Violin Concerto in A major and Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 4, to great public acclaim.Patmore D. Review of Tahra CD 520. Classic Record Collector, August 2004. One week later he was appointed musical director of the orchestra by the Soviet official Nikolai Berzarin, replacing Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, who was in exile in Switzerland. His anti-Nazi credentials and command of the Russian language enabled him to enjoy a close relationship with the occupiers. He gave 22 concerts in total as chief conductor of the BPO. Borchard was killed while being driven home after a concert on 23 August 1945. His British driver misinterpreted an American sentry's hand signal to stop, and the sentry fired on the car, accidentally killing Borchard. The British driver and Borchard's partner Ruth Andreas-Friedrich survived. As a result of this incident, it was decided to mark military checkpoints more prominently so that hand signals were not required. On 5 and 6 September 1995 Claudio Abbado and the Berlin Philharmonic marked the anniversary of Borchard's death with performances of Mahler's 6th Symphony.

Biography =Early years= Watkins was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, where he played most of his cricket. He started playing grade cricket for Waratah-Mayfield District Cricket Club in the late 1950s. For four seasons he travelled to Sydney and played for Western Suburbs District Cricket Club under former Test cricketer Alan Davidson. In 1959‚Äì60 he played for Sydney Metropolitan Colts against Tasmania and took 5-16 for Newcastle against a touring Fijian side. That summer he played against Newcastle for the NSW Country Second XI. Watkins played for NSW Colts in 1960‚Äì61. The same summer he played for Northern New South Wales, making 81 as an opener in a game against Southern NSW. In 1961‚Äì62 Watkins took three wickets in an over in a colts game against Queensland.He also played South Australia ‚Äì see https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/97/97112.html That summer he also took 6-66 against Southern NSW. In 1962‚Äì63 he scored 94 in a colts game against Queensland, taking part in a century plus stand with Doug Walters.See also https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/109/109168.html In 1964‚Äì65 he took seven wickets in a colts game against Queensland.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/109/109169.html ‚Äì he also played Victoria ‚Äì see https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/169/169732.html He continued playing for NSW Colts the following summer. Eventually Watkins got sick of travelling and stopped playing grade cricket in Sydney. However he came to national prominence when he represented Northern New South Wales in a non- first-class match against the touring Indian side in 1967‚Äì68. He took ten wickets. The following summer he took 5-42 against the ACT for Newcastle. In the return match in 1969‚Äì70 he scored 66 not out and took 5-57 then 6-54 the following year. He represented Northern NSW against the touring English side in 1970‚Äì71 but had less success than against the Indians, taking three expensive wickets. =1971‚Äì72 First-class debut= In 1971‚Äì72 Watkins took 4-99 for Northern NSW against the touring World XI, including the wicket of Graeme Pollock. He played for NSW against \\"The Thrashers\\" that summer and took 4-19 including the wickets of Richie Benaud and Neil Harvey. A few weeks later he was selected to play for New South Wales against South Australia after John Gleeson withdrew through injury. In the first innings Watkins took 4 for 72 out of a total of 252 for 5 declared, his victims including Ian Chappell (stumped) and Greg Chappell. =1972‚Äì73 season= John Gleeson was dropped from the NSW side at the beginning of the 1972‚Äì73 season and was replaced by Watkins. However, in four Sheffield Shield matches he took only six wickets. The six wickets were taken in the one game, against Victoria, where his scalps included Graham Yallop. It was Watkins' 6 for 38 to bowl Northern New South Wales to victory against the touring Pakistan side that led the national selectors to choose him as the only spinner for the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground a month later, after only five first-class matches in which he had taken 10 wickets at 39.00. (By contrast, in his four matches for Northern New South Wales against touring teams he had taken 24 wickets at 21.35.)Statistics derived from scorecards under Miscellaneous matches played by John Watkins at Cricket Archive Ashley Mallett had withdrawn from the side for business reasons and the selectors had elected to take three leg spinners on the tour to the West Indies: Watkins, Terry Jenner and Kerry O'Keeffe. Watkins bowled poorly in his next game, for NSW against Victoria. =Test match= Prior to his Test debut Rohan Rivett wrote that: > There will be a lot of sympathy for Watkins when he takes the field > tomorrow. His selection was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed > by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour > reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and > Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will > have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the > highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left > school.

Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as > anyone else and would be amazed if the selectors confine him to the 12th man > role. In the Test Watkins bowled inaccurately and took no wickets in his one brief spell. He later recalled: > That bad bowling on that Sunday, that's the only regret I have in cricket, > and I'm sorry I can't have it over again, because knowing what I could do, > in my opinion, that's what hurts most of all [that I didn't get a chance to > atone].

The only person who gave me some moral support, after I'd > bowled the six overs, was Keith Stackpole, he was vice-captain. He ran up > and said, 'It's not easy first-up, 'Wok'. I thought it was good of him to > say that. Unfortunately I had one opportunity and I botched it; I lacked > disposition on the day and after that I lost my confidence. In the Australian second innings, with Australia eight wickets down and a lead of only 75, his ninth-wicket partnership of 83 with Bob Massie gave Australia enough leeway to achieve a narrow victory. Watkins made 36, having scored only 12 runs in his previous five first-class matches. He did not bowl in the second innings but took the catch that won Australia the match. \\"As far as the batting goes and the catch, I'm pleased I got something out of the wreck\\", says Watkins. \\"We [him and Massie] just plugged along, hoped for the best and took it in our stride. I wasn't nervous; I was pretty casual [in fact]. I could always handle a bat; I thought, 'I'll either get runs or I won't'.\\" =West Indies tour= The tour of the West Indies began poorly for Australia, with injuries to Bob Massie and Dennis Lillee resulting in a very real chance Watkins could play a Test. However he was made 12th man for 3 out of the first five games. He took 2-28 against Leeward Islands then four wickets against Trinidad and Tobago. Watkins took four wickets against Guyana, including Clive Lloyd. but could not force his way into the Test team. He took no wickets against the Windward Islands in what turned out to be his last first-class game. His entire first-class career, of 10 matches, had taken only 14 months. In the match against Trinidad and Tobago, Doug Walters mischievously suggested to Watkins that he might relax if he whistled \\"What Shall We Do With The Drunken Sailor?\\" as he ran in to bowl. Watkins did so ‚Äì much to the amusement of Walters ‚Äì but still bowled wide of the stumps.The Doug Walters Story, Rigby, Adelaide, 1981, p. 112. Watkins reflected: > When you lose your confidence you don't want to bowl again. When I went on > the West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets at an > average of about 25, and 10 of them were in first-class games. I only bowled > about 78 overs on tour.

I appreciated the experience [in the Caribbean], but after > three months with no confidence [in my bowling] I was pleased to get back > home. =Later career= Watkins was dropped from the NSW side at the beginning of the 1973‚Äì74 season. He continued to play club cricket, mostly as a batsman, in Newcastle, where he worked for a shipping company.The Oxford Companion to Australian Cricket, OUP, Melbourne, 1996, p. 566. In 1976‚Äì77 he took 4-66 for Newcastle against Sydney.

The group consisted of Dallas Holm on acoustic guitar and vocals, Tim and Ladonna Johnson on keyboards and vocals, as well as Randy Adams on bass. Dallas Holm's influence has been greatest in contemporary Christian music. While he has had several hit singles in CCM, he is best known for the favorite inspirational song \\"Rise Again\\" which is about the resurrection of Christ. Over the course of Holm's tenure in gospel music he has performed many styles of music including adult contemporary, country, blues, reggae and pop/rock. Holm remains active as the director of Praise Ministries and is a member of the Christian Motorcyclists Association. He resides in Lindale, Texas when not on tour. History Holm, a native of Minnesota, was inspired by Elvis Presley and the Byrds when he was growing up and, while in high school, was a member of a rock band. After Holm came to faith in 1965 at the age of 16, he desired to combine his music with his newfound faith. He started writing his own Christian songs around this time performing them in jails, churches and in street ministry. During the late 60s, Holm was a member of a Christian group called the Tri-Tones who made an album entitled I Saw the Light released by the Universal Audio Corp. He expanded his use of music while he was a youth pastor in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. Holm's music eventually caught the attention of David Wilkerson, author of The Cross and the Switchblade, and became a part of Wilkerson's traveling crusades. As a solo artist, his early albums for Zondervan and Impact contained worship songs done in a MOR rock style. During his time with Wilkerson, Holm became the front man for a group named Praise. Aside from Holm, other members of Dallas Holm & Praise consisted of Randy Adams (bass - replaced by Rick Crawford in 1980), Ric Norris (drums), Tim Johnson (keyboards), and LaDonna Gatlin Johnson (vocals). This group released the album Dallas Holm & Praise. . .Live (Greentree, 1977) which sold more than 600,000 copies and was the first Christian album to be certified gold. This album contains the song Rise Again which was one of the biggest radio hits in the history of Christian music. The song has the distinction of garnering a GMA Dove Award in 1978 for Song of the Year. Holm was awarded Songwriter of the Year along with Male Vocalist of the Year in 1978 with the group itself winning Mixed Group of the Year. Over the course of Holm's career he has released 34 albums counting solo, with Praise or other artists. He has received a total of 5 Dove Awards as of 2020. Holm has also been inducted into the Texas Gospel Music Hall of Fame (2007) and the GMA Gospel Music Hall of Fame in 2012. Holm is married and he and his wife, Linda, have two grown children, Jennifer and Jeffery.

It is often considered to be a microquasar, and it is believed to be a compact object in a binary system which is pulling in a stream of gas from an ordinary star companion. It is the only known HMXB containing a Wolf-Rayet star. It is invisible visually, but can be observed at radio, infrared, X-ray, and gamma-ray wavelengths. Observations Cygnus X3 and its X-ray halo Cygnus X-3 is a prominent X-ray source, with soft and hard X-rays both varying in intensity. Periods where the hard X-rays are at minimum intensity are known as soft states. It is less than half a degree from a gamma-ray pulsar, but is itself a weak gamma-ray source. It also shows periodic gamma-ray flares, apparently all occurring during the soft state. It is undetectable at visual wavelengths due to extreme extinction in the galactic plane. However, there is an infrared point source at its position. Cygnus X-3 is also notable as the only microquasar firmly detected in the high energy gamma rays in the range >100 MeV. Because of the variations in emission at various wavelengths, Cygnus X-3 has been given the variable star designation V1521 Cygni. Flares Cygnus X-3 is notable for its intense X-ray emission and ultra-high energy cosmic rays, but it is also remarkable for its gamma-ray and radio flares during which it becomes the brightest radio source in the Milky Way. The gamma-ray flares apparently occur in the quiet radio period before a major radio flare. During the giant radio flares, a relativistic jet has been resolved within about of being aimed directly towards us. Binary system Cygnus X-3 shows consistent variations across all wavelengths with a period. The nature of the infrared spectrum and the x-ray emission is interpreted as a binary system containing a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star and a compact object. The variations have been interpreted as eclipses, but this is thought to be unlikely because there are not well-defined periodic dips in the brightness. The orbit of the binary system is not known accurately, other than the period. Therefore, the masses of the components are not known accurately. Orbital analysis suggested that the mass of the compact object is less than , probably around . It could possibly be a neutron star but is more likely to be a black hole. The combination of a WR star and a black hole would be the only known example. While the combination of WR star and compact object would be unique, the WR component will itself almost certainly become a black hole very quickly by astronomical timescales. A supernova or possible direct collapse to a black hole is expected within a million years or so. However, modelling of the Cygnus X-3 system suggests it is most likely that the binary will be disrupted by any supernova event. The cosmic ray events from Cygnus X-3 had previously led to exotic proposals such as a star made of quarks, but are now explained as being produced in the relativistic jet. The explanation for the unusual relationship between the x-rays and the gamma-ray and radio flares is that the compact objects produces jets along its axis of rotation, within the dense wind from the WR star. These jets evacuate a cocoon within the wind when entering the hard state, and are then quenched by the wind when entering the soft state. Flares are produced during the transition to the hard state as the jets are interacting with the dense wind. Distance Cygnus X-3 lies in the direction of the Cygnus OB2 association in the Cygnus X complex, although it is much further away Its distance can be estimated relative to Cygnus OB2 by studying the X-ray halo produced by dust between us and Cygnus X-3. The distance to Cygnus OB2 is not known precisely, but this method gives possible distances to Cygnus X-3 of or . There is a small X-ray source from Cygnus X-3 that varies with the same period by a phase lag of about . This is thought to be a Bok globule at approximately the same distance as Cygnus X-3. Using molecular line emission from this object, two possible distances are found to be and . A statistical mean is .

Written from a supposedly medical perspective, it exemplified the scientific racism characteristic of the era. Plot summary The book told the story of a young Jewish doctor, who because of antisemitic pressures, seeks to escape his Jewishness by submitting himself to violent and painful ethnic plastic surgery. The doctor has stereotypical Jewish features: black curly hair, oily skin, thick lips, and a large, hooked nose, an effeminate voice, poor posture, and orthopedic impairments. He agrees to undergo a complex medical operation in order to free himself from his Jewishness. Ultimately, he arranges to have all his bones straightened out, has his hair dyed blonde, and gets his larynx altered to change his voice. He is placed in a bathtub and given a blood transfusion by pure Aryan virgins. Having been seemingly cured of his Jewishness, he weds a blonde German woman. However, just as he is about to deliver a speech at his wedding, his voice takes on a high pitch, as all his previous Jewish features resurface. He eventually becomes a gelatinous puddle on the floor, signifying an idea that Jewishness cannot be overcome by attempts at cultural assimilation. The book incorporates the elements of racial antisemitism of the era: The expression of desire on part of the Jew to escape his cultural identity, the lengths to which he will go to transform himself, the pornographic quality of the attempted transformation, and the impossibility of it all. It sought to illustrate an idea that Jews cannot escape their race; and that if they try, they become subhuman or untermensch.

Its type species is A. atacis, named by Le Loeuff in 1995. A possible unnamed species has given Ampelosaurus an age reaching to the latest Cretaceous, from about 70 to 66 million years ago. Like most sauropods, it would have had a long neck and tail but it also carried armor in the form of osteoderms. Over 500 bones have been assigned to Ampelosaurus and all but the braincase (assigned to A. sp.) has been assigned to A. atacis. They are assigned to the same species because all the differences in the limb proportions have been linked to individual variation. A. atacis is known from a few, well-preserved teeth and some cranial material. A right scapula was discovered associated with a coracoid. The blade of the scapula, contrary to most titanosaurs, is triangular. The blade narrows at one end instead of showing an expansion like most other genera. A. atacis is also known from a pubis about long and an ilium. Aside from that, it is known from a partial forelimb, and many femora. Titanosaurians were a flourishing group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. The Spanish locality from the latest Cretaceous of ‚ÄúLo Hueco‚Äù yielded a relatively well preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares a number of unique features with A. atacis from France. However, it appeared to differ from A. atacis in some traits also. The specimen has been provisionally identified as Ampelosaurus sp.; it is most likely a mature titanosaurian since the bones of the braincase have largely fused together. Ampelosaurus lived alongside many other animals. Over 8500 specimens have been found alongside it, including gastropods, bivalves, crocodiles, other sauropods, plants and invertebrates in the Villalba de la Sierra, Gres de Saint-Chinian, Marnes Rouges Inf√©rieures and Gres de Labarre formations. Recent attention has made Ampelosaurus one of the most well-known dinosaurs known from France. Description Size compared to a human Like most sauropods, Ampelosaurus would have had a long neck and tail, but it also carried armor in the form of osteoderms long. The four osteoderms found have three different morphologies, they are plate, bulb, and spine-shaped. Ampelosaurus is thought to have measured to in length and about 8000 kg in weight.Paul, G.S., 2010 The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 207 Ampelosaurus atacis is known from many unattached bones and teeth. It is one of the best-known dinosaurs from France. It is considered to be a dwarf sauropod by Coria et al. (2005) because it has a smaller size in comparison with its ancestors. =Skeleton= Life restoration, with hypothetical osteoderm covering Ampelosaurus is one of the most completely known titanosaurian sauropods from Europe. Since 1989, over 500 bones discovered at the Upper Cretaceous Bellevue locality of southern France have been assigned to A. atacis. An abundant amount of well-preserved elements have been uncovered at Bellevue. In the original description, only a tooth and some vertebrae were examined. In 2005, a complete description was made by Le Loueff of all known material, allowing Ampelosaurus to be much better understood. All the material has been assigned to the species, and even though there are some differences in limb proportions, it has all been linked to individual variation. Skull of A. atacis A. atacis is known from a few, well-preserved teeth and some cranial material, a tooth of which was described in its original description. The teeth differentiate Ampelosaurus from Magyarosaurus and Lirainosaurus, both of which are also from Europe. The teeth are different from the two later genera as Ampelosaurus has teeth that are roughly cylindrical in the top with thin expansions at the bottom. They are high and about wide. Those expansions give its teeth a slight constriction between the root and the crown. The teeth are also quite different from the peg-like teeth of titanosaurids. The teeth, have a general morphology similar to titanosaurians Antarctosaurus and a braincase from Dongargaon. Another skull was described from southern France, but showed some differences, meaning there could have been at least two different titanosaurians in France during the Late Cretaceous. The scapula was found attached to a coracoid. In the longer direction, the bone is long. The blade of the scapula, contrary to titanosaurs, is triangular, larger closer to the base. The blade narrows distally instead of showing an expansion. Differing from Magyarosaurus and Saltasaurus, the scapula does not have the dorsal crest at the base of the scapular blade. The shape of the coracoid is quadrangular, and the coracoid has a thickened cranial margin. Mounted skeleton cast Ampelosaurus is also known from a pubis, about long. It has a strong distal expansion, that is similar to a titanosaur from Brazil, and a large foramen. Contrary to the South American titanosaurs, the ilium does not have an expansion on the side. The ischium, known from a shaft, is unexpanded distally and very well developed. It is also very flat. An incomplete radius is also known. It lacks the proximal and distal ends, and possesses a very prominent ridge along it. The largest and best-preserved specimens are both ulnas. The right ulna has a total length of . The right ulna is small and slender, is missing an olecranon, and has a well-marked ridge. The left ulna is larger, with a length of . The ulna has a deep radial fossa. About 27 femora are known from Bellevue, making them the most common bone, most of them more-or-less complete. They are very flat craniocaudally but otherwise, lack any unusual features. In a study of its bone physiology, it was found that the maximum known femur length was , which is much larger than previously known (). That means, that the ancestors Ampelosaurus were slightly smaller than itself. 18 humeri are also known, but none of them approach the size of the largest femur. The humeri do not have a free medullary cavity. The humeri are robust, about long, with very expanded distal and proximal ends. Three different types of osteoderms have been recovered at Bellevue. Two with large spines have been uncovered. At the base of each spine, which is about tall, are two large foramina. The internal faces are all concavo-convex and have a ridge opposite the spine. In side view, they have two sections, a low half that progressively thickens, and a spine. Vertebrae The holotype specimen of A. atacis is a group of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue and most of them are poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they face toward the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002. =Distinguishing anatomical features= Osteoderm This set of characters was identified by Le Loeuff in his description of Ampelosaurus to distinguish it from all other genera: teeth that weakly spatulate; a laterally widening distal extremity of neural spines on the dorsal vertebrae; neural arch of the dorsal vertebrae inclining strongly towards the rear; the lack of a distal expansion on the scapular blade; the presence of a light, ventral crest on top of the scapula; the presence of plate, bulb, and spine shaped osteoderms; and, in 2005, Le Loeuff added that the constriction of the neural spine on the dorsal and cervical vertebrae was also probably a characteristic of Ampelosaurus. =Ampelosaurus sp.= Referred braincase and CT scans A fossil braincase from Lo Hueco was tentatively assigned to an unnamed species of Ampelosaurus, A. sp., in a 2013 article in the journal PLoS ONE. The braincase was found to share many features with A. atacis, such as a back of the skull that is flat. The braincase, MCCM-HUE-8741, is small in size overall, with a front-to-back length of , and the maximum width of the left half being . Parts of the bottom half of the braincase are missing. Even though section are missing, the specimen does not appear to have been deformed much, as the left and right halves are not very different. Two frontals are preserved. They are each long and wide. The upper surface of each frontal is not smooth. One crest runs along the each frontal, and the together the two crests make up the orbital roof. Both parietals have also been found. The connection between them is marked by a œâ-shaped crest. Viewed from the side, the parietal has two extensions. These extensions are not fully preserved, but they would have been on the border of the upper temporal fenestrae in their middle. Each parietal was preserved as wide. The basioccipital of the specimen from Lo Hueco is unique as it has an occipital condyle that is much wider than tall. The occipital condyle has an irregular surface that was probably caused by the loss of the original cartilaginous covering. The complete braincase was especially low in the skull, and was oriented to the side. The occipital condyle is wide and tall. The braincase floor is made by the parabasisphenoid. The prootic is a tall but not long bone. The basisphenoid is mostly on the side of it, along with the laterosphenoid, the parietal, and the otoccipital. The length of the prootic from the front to the back is around . Neuroanatomy Endocast of the brain showing the labyrinth Compared with Giraffititan, the inner ear of A. sp. shows a more basal morphology. That feature is possibly related to a restricted range of possible movements that involve head-turning. Like in Jainosaurus and most other non-avian archosaurs, the hindbrain and midbrain of A. sp. is relatively poorly preserved in the endocast. In contrast with TMM 40435 and a few other taxa such as cf. Cetiosaurus oxoniensis and Giraffatitan, no characteristic \\"nub\\" of the cerebellum can be seen. As in TMM 40435 and many other archosaurs, the back of the brain is especially narrow in A. sp. The cerebral region of the brain is separated from the rest of the brain by a distinct compression caused in the endocranial cavity. The rearmost part of the cerebral region of the braincase has a top with a small expansion. This is different from Jainosaurus. However, relatively much larger expansions are known in the diplodocoid sauropods Dicraeosaurus and Diplodocus. In MCCM-HUE-8741, the small opening in the skull roof middle is responsible for a swelling on the endocast that is suggestive of a pineal system. It is in the exact position where the pineal gland is expected to have been, between the forebrain and the midbrain. The semicircular canals are contracted, and they are highly curved. The semicircular system of MCCM-HUE-8741 shows also a basal morphology, because the semicircular canals do not attach to each other. Discovery and naming Assortment of bones, Mus√©e des dinosaures, France Ampelosaurus was originally found near the commune of Campagne-sur-Aude in the Aude d√©partement of France. It was recovered in the lower levels of the Marnes Rouges Inf√©rieures Formation, which belong to the early Maastrichtian epoch of the Late Cretaceous Period, ~ 70 million years ago. These sediments represent an ancient floodplain with numerous river channels. French paleontologist Jean Le Loeuff first described and named this dinosaur in 1995. Ampelosaurus is derived from the Greek Œ±ŒºœÄŒµŒªŒøœÇ, \\"the vine\\" and the Latinised Greek saurus, \\"reptile\\". Therefore, Ampelosaurus means \\"vineyard lizard\\" after the Blanquette de Limoux vineyard. The vineyard is located on the south side of the region Ampelosaurus was found in. The specific name is based on the Latin atax, the \\"Aude river\\". The first remains were found in a bonebed discovered in 1989, which produced numerous ribs and vertebrae from the back and tail, as well as many limb bones, but no skull material aside from one tooth. Four osteoderms of different sizes and shapes were also recovered from this bonebed. This material comes from several different individuals. Since 1989, more material has been uncovered in the same region of France, including a relatively complete skeleton with some elements of the skull and lower jaw. Later, in 2001, the Campagne-sur-Aude site was explored again, this time by Gerard Chauvet, Jean-Luc Le Douarec, Colette Rives and Yvonne Vidoux. After 13 years of searching, they had uncovered a mostly complete skeleton that contained much more material, including bones unknown from the holotype. The material all went to the Musee des Dinosaures, and together took about 10 years to assemble. The A. sp. was discovered in 2007. It was found in the course of the construction of a high-speed rail track connecting Madrid with Valencia, in a fossil site that many animals were found in, in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. The site was at a locality named ‚ÄúLo Hueco,‚Äù near the village of Fuentes, Castile-La Mancha, Spain. Over the course of several months, a large-scale emergency excavation by over 60 paleontologists and 100 manual workers allowed thousands of specimens of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates of late Campanian-early Maastrichtian age to be saved, including A. sp. Classification Characteristics of the tail vertebrae and the presence of osteoderms indicate that Ampelosaurus belongs to Lithostrotia, a group of derived titanosaurians which also includes Alamosaurus and Saltasaurus. Many other paleontologists have classified Ampelosaurus as belonging to Titanosauria, Saltasauridae, and Titanosauridae. Ampelosaurus may have an uncertain classification, but it is clearly a titanosaur, with many features found in titanosaurs. Dorsal vertebra, Mus√©e des dinosaures, France Reconstructed forearm and hand More recently, Ampelosauurs has been put in a clade with other French and Spanish titanosaurs from the late Campanian to Maastrichtian, which was named Lirainosaurinae by D√≠ez D√≠az et al. in 2018. Ampelosaurus nested as sister taxon to Atsinganosaurus also from France, and the entire clade was placed in between the taxa commonly classified as Saltasauridae and taxa normally in either Aeolosaurini or Lognkosauria. Paleobiology =Growth= Ampelosaurus seems to have grown in a way similar to more basal sauropods. After a certain point in its development, the microscopic material of the bone became very different from more basal Sauropoda. Ampelosaurus grew more slowly once the bone microstructure became unique among sauropods. Although Diplodocoidea and basal Macronaria also show an increase in bone growth and a decrease in growth rate around the presumed onset of sexual maturity, it is much more gradual than Ampelosaurus. The process of growing, which in other sauropods started around sexual maturity, was clearly delayed in Ampelosaurus. The period of growth after sexual maturity seems to be shortened in Ampelosaurus and is dominated by slow bone building instead of fast growth. Growth marks are generally rare in sauropods or appearing only late in ontogeny, if at all. The lack of growth marks is suggestive of fast and continuous growth in sauropods, which supports the hypothesis that they achieved large body size through because of fast growth. Ampelosaurus does not show growth marks on any bone sample. This is unusual to be found with the apparently reduced growth rate and high level of bone growth seen in it, as those features are often associated with the occurrence of growth marks. =Histology= Fossil femur EFS, a system found on the surface of bones, is thought to show a growth plateau which indicates that maximum body size and skeletal maturity is reached in an individual. Ampelosaurus has not been known to have EFS, found on most non-titanosaurian sauropods. Magyarosaurus, a closely related titanosaur, Lirainosaurus, a titanosaur related to saltasaurids, Alamosaurus, a saltasaurid, and Phuwiangosaurus, a very basal titanosaur, were also found to have lacked EFS. However, the basal macronarian Europasaurus has been shown to have had EFS, so it was likely just titanosaurians that did not have them. The outer edge of the bones, were EFS would have been found, was well-preserved, and still lacked any fossilized proof of them being present for Ampelosaurus. However, in the PLoS ONE study that found the lack of EFS, the larger specimens were not tested, so Ampelosaurus might have had EFS. This is characteristic of titanosaurs, as diplodocoids and basal macronarians seem to have EFS. A majority of all Ampelosaurus specimens have been found with secondary osteons placed densely in the inner regions of bones, and lightly in outer regions. The osteon orientation found in Ampelosaurus of osteons not only facing across the bone is not typical of Neosauropoda. Also, there is no medullary cavity in any bones of Ampelosaurus. Ampelosaurus seems to have had many ontogenetic stages in its life based on its bone histology. Paleoecology Ampelosaurus atacis is known from a specimen from the Marnes Rouges Inf√©rieures Formation. More specifically, it is known from the Bellevue layer, which has produced many vertebrate fossils. Even though it produced many vertebrates, the formation only has a few elements of plants and invertebrates. The vertebrates consist of numerous remains of Ampelosaurus, scales of Lepisosteus, shell fragments of an indeterminate turtle, cranial fragments and teeth of a crocodile, isolated theropod teeth, classified as Dromaeosauridae indet., an indeterminate ankylosaur, and a dentary and many postcranial elements of Rhabdodon priscus. The bird Gargantuavis philoinos, and dinosaur eggs have also been recovered. Another formation A. atacis is known from is Gres de Saint-Chinian. Along with Ampelosaurus, Rhabdodon priscus, Rhabdodon septimanicus, dinosaur eggs, a Nodosauridae indet. (previously known as Rhodanosaurus lugdunensis), \\"Megalosaurus\\" pannoniensis, Variraptor mechinorum, an Avialae indet., an Enantiornithes indet., and a possible Abelisauridae indet. are known from this formation. A. atacis is one of few vertebrates known from the Gres de Labarre Formation. The only other fossils from the formation belong to Rhabdodon priscus and a Nodosauridae indet. =Villalba de la Sierra Formation= Excavation of A. sp. in 2007 The A. sp. is from the latest Cretaceous aged Lo Hueco region in the Villalba de la Sierra Formation. A study shows that the area around Lo Hueco dates to the late Campanian and early Maastrichtian, although a more recent study revised the later date to the latest Maastrichtian. The study showed that Lo Hueco was near the coast of the Tethys Sea, a large seaway through southern Europe and northern Africa. The area directly on the coast was shown to be a brackish-freshwater aquatic environment, with a muddy flood-plain beside it. Lo Hueco was found to be inside the flood-plain. The flood plain was found to have distributary channels of sand and terrigenous material. About 8500 different marcoremains have been found in Lo Hueco. Sauropods make up the largest amount of the remains with many articulated individuals, caudal vertebrae and teeth. The caudal vertebrae have been identified as being from a titanosaur closely related to Lirainsaurus, but with some differences. The teeth, were assigned to Ampelosaurus atacis. Apart from sauropods, the Villalba de la Sierra Formation has a good representation of carbonized plants, mostly known from branches and leaves, and invertebrates, mostly bivalves and gastropods. Fishes from the formation include lepisosteid, which have plenty of material, and unidentified actinopterygians and teleosteans. Turtle fossils are very common, even more common than fishes. Of all this material, only two different groups have been identified, the bothremydids Polysternon and Rosasia, along with an uncommon undetermined Pancryptodiran. Squamate lizards are known only from a few undetermined specimens, and eusuchian crocodiles are known from a specimen with similarities to Allodaposuchus and Musturzabalsuchus. Ornithischias and theropod dinosaurs are not as common as sauropods but still consist of much material. Basal euornithopods and probable ankylosaurians are known from Lo Hueco. The ankylosaurian remains consist of a few vertebrae. Rhabdodon sp. is known from the formation, and is known from a fair amount of elements. Only two theropods have been identified, both Dromaeosauridae indet., one dromaeosaurine and one velociraptorine. =Biogeography= Referred egg Titanosaurians were a flourishing group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. Fossils of titanosaurians have been found on all continents and their remains are abundant in a number of Late Cretaceous sites. Nonetheless, the cranial anatomy of titanosaurians is still very poorly known. Ampelosaurus is now the best known sauropod from Europe. Others include Magyarosaurus from Hungary and an unnamed species from Catalonia, Spain. Numerous other fragments and isolated bones may or may not belong to any of these forms. While most titanosaurs are found in the southern continents of Gondwana, several derived species are known from Maastrichtian sediments in the Northern Hemisphere, including Alamosaurus in North America and Opisthocoelicaudia in Asia, indicating that there must have been at least intermittent connections between the northern and southern continents. This seems to be corroborated by the European find of Tarascosaurus, a Late Cretaceous theropod dinosaur similar to the abelisaurids, otherwise known only from the southern continents. Ampelosaurus sp. is a distinct sauropod as it is known from just a braincase. Although the number of sauropod braincases from the Late Cretaceous European archipelago found to date is limited, it shows a significant diversity. The specimen from Lo Hueco resembles the braincase of A. atacis MDE C3‚Äì761.

Founded in South Shields, England, as an importer of oil cloth, J. Barbour and Sons Ltd has become well known for its waxed cotton jackets which are a common element of British country clothing. The company's waxed cotton jackets are so well known that some people refer to any waxed cotton jacket as a \\"Barbour jacket\\", irrespective of manufacturer. J. Barbour and Sons Ltd holds royal warrant to supply \\"waterproof and protective clothing\\" from Queen Elizabeth II in 1974, the Duke of Edinburgh in 1982, and Charles, Prince of Wales in 1987. Since July 2016, Scottish actor Sam Heughan is Barbour's First Global Brand Ambassador.  History  John Barbour, a native of Galloway, Scotland, founded J. Barbour and Sons Ltd in South Shields, England, in 1894 as an importer of oil-cloth. John's grandson Duncan, a keen motorcyclist, would also take the company in that direction during his tenure as Barbour became the originator of waxed cotton motorcycling suits and jackets. The headquarters for J. Barbour and Sons Ltd at the time of its foundation was located at 5 Market Place, South Shields and the company remains in South Shields today having occupied its current site since the 1980s. While the traditional waxed cotton jackets are still manufactured in Simonside, South Shields, some of the other products are manufactured outside the United Kingdom.

Rangers were hunters and skilled woodsmen, and often lived reclusive lives as hermits. Publication history =Creative origins= The ranger was primarily based on the character Aragorn, and the Rangers of the North of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle- earth mythos, as warriors who use tracking and other wilderness skills to hunt down their enemies. The AD&D; second edition handbook mentions several other inspirations from myth and legend, such as Robin Hood, Jack the Giant Killer, the huntress Diana, and the Greek hero Orion. Other notable rangers in the literature of Dungeons & Dragons include Hank from the cartoon series, King Tristan Kendrick from Forgotten Realms, and Ren from Pool of Radiance. =Original Dungeons & Dragons= The ranger was introduced in The Strategic Review volume 1, number 2. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition= The ranger was one of the standard character-classes available in the original Player's Handbook, one of five subclasses. The first edition rangers were a subtype of the fighters, using any weapon and wearing any armor, but they gained extra attacks at a slower rate than fighters and paladins. Unlike other warriors, the ranger used d8 hit dice instead of d10s, but had a second hit die at 1st level and maxed out at 11 hit dice instead of nine. Rangers also had extensive tracking abilities, based on a percentage score, and were able to surprise opponents on a roll of 1‚Äì3 on a d6 (rather than a 1‚Äì2) while they themselves could only be surprised on a 1. Rangers gained limited spell use at level 8, acquiring 1st‚Äì3rd level druid spells and 1st and 2nd level magic-user spells (two per level maximum). Rangers were most effective when fighting giants and humanoids (such as orcs), gaining a +1 to damage per level against these opponents. High level rangers gained followers, ranging in type and power from classed player-character races, to creatures such as pegasus mounts, pseudodragons, werebears, copper dragons and storm giants. As a general rule, the fewer followers a ranger gained (based on random dice rolls) the more powerful each individual follower was. Rangers were required to be of good alignment, and were initially limited to humans and half-elves. The only multi-class option open to rangers was the ranger/cleric, allowed to half- elves. =Basic Dungeons & Dragons= The ranger was not available as a character class in the game's \\"Basic\\" edition. However, the Best of Dragon Magazine volumes 2‚Äì3 contained variant rules for rangers for this version, including spell lists, henchmen, and tracking ability. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition= Rangers went through several changes in the 2nd edition. Their hit dice were changed to match fighters and paladins. Rangers could still wear any armor, but several of their new abilities required the use of light armor, including the skill to use two weapons without penalty and the thief-like abilities of move-silently and hide-in-shadows. The class retained its tracking abilities but the ability was based on a skill check instead of a percentage roll. Rangers also gained an animal empathy ability which allowed them to calm frightened or hostile animals. Instead of gaining a damage bonus against all giant and humanoid monsters, the ranger focused on a specific creature, which did not have to be of giant or humanoid stock. The class's spell abilities were also limited to 1st‚Äì3rd level priest spells from the plant and animal spheres. Higher level rangers could recruit various woodland animals, mythical creatures (such as the treant, pegasus, and pixie), and classed characters including druids, clerics, or other rangers as followers. Although Rangers were generally Good-aligned, an evil version was featured with the Paka, a race of shape-shifting feline humanoids native to Ravenloft who are hostile to mankind.Entry: \\"Paka\\". Monstrous Compendium ‚Äì Ravenloft Appendix III: Creatures of Darkness (TSR 2153, 1994), pp.88-89. =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= The 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons saw more changes to the ranger. The species enemy was now called favored enemy, and the ranger was allowed to select additional enemies during advancement. The class retained its spellcasting ability, but gained it much earlier, and had its own spell list. The nature of the ranger's companions also changed significantly. Instead of gaining multiple followers the ranger gained a single animal companion, and at an earlier level than in previous editions. The race and alignment restrictions of the earlier editions were dropped, allowing evil rangers for the first time. =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= Rangers in the 4th edition retained their ability to specialize in archery or two weapon fighting. Rangers had the striker role, specializing in single- target damage, as well as mobility. They had the martial power source, and, like all martial classes, their powers were called exploits. Their special abilities made them better suited to hit and run tactics and focusing on a single opponent. Other abilities allowed the ranger to aid his companions with skill checks and avoiding ambushes. Dungeons & Dragons Essentials The Essentials rulebook Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms presented two alternate versions of the ranger, the hunter and the scout. The hunter focused on ranged attacks, while the scout focused on melee attacks. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The ranger was included as a character class in the 5th edition Player's Handbook. At third level, players chose from one of two ranger archetypes: the hunter, and the beast master. The hunter archetype gains combative capabilities, while the beast master gains an animal companion to control. Xanathar's Guide to Everything adds three more ranger archetypes: the Gloom Stalker, Horizon Walker and Monster Slayer. The Gloom Stalker focuses upon hiding in areas of low light, the Horizon Walker gains access to certain teleportation features, and the Monster Slayer becomes adept at attacking certain studied foes. Rangers are a half caster class in 5th edition, gaining limited spellcasting. Their features and spells focus on exploration, survival skills, and tracking foes.  Reception  Screen Rant rated the ranger class as the least powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition. \\"The reason this class gets the lowest ranking is because it forces players to be kind of specific. Being able to have a favored enemy and terrain is kind of cool because the character gets all sorts of bonuses, but if the Ranger is good, say, in the Underdark fighting aberrations, but the DM has set the adventure in a desert ruin somewhere, well, those bonuses won't do much good. That being said, the Revised Ranger stats help balance this out a little bit. Players don't have to be as specific, but still\\". The Gamer rated the 5th edition ranger subclass Horizon Walker as the 8th most awesome subclass out of the 32 new character options in Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything. Gus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \\"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D; Beyond from\\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, rangers were the 6th most created at 8,887 total. Elf (3,076) was the most common racial combination followed by human (1,715) and then half-elf (891). Elf ranger was the second most created character out of all the class and race combinations.

It is situated south-west of Hartley Wintney, east of Basingstoke, north-east of Odiham and west of London. It is connected to London Waterloo and Basingstoke by the South Western Main Line. Winchfield consists of a recently rebuilt village hall (in 1998), a church, a 17th- century inn called the Winchfield Inn and a combination of old residential properties and new ones. Winchfield parish currently has a population of 581 people, which was projected to rise to just over 600 in 2008. The population is scattered across this wide parish, which includes Potbridge, settlement around Winchfield church, Winchfield Hurst and Shapley Heath. History There was a Stone Age settlement at Bagwell Green, a few hundred yards past the church in the direction of Odiham Common. Winchfield also has a few examples of 16th- and 17th-century buildings, particularly near the church. Winchfield's manor was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1088. In 1838, a station was constructed, known as Shapley Heath and was renamed Winchfield Station, probably in 1840, although the exact date for this is unknown. Between 1838 and 1839, Shapley Heath station served as the terminus point for all rail services from London. From here, all mail was then distributed to the rest of the South of England by mail coach. This continued for about a year, when the railway was extended to Basingstoke late in 1839.. Notably, there was also a large workhouse located in Pale Lane which then became a hospital and has since been the subject of redevelopment into a housing development.http://www.hart.gov.uk/index/community_living/guide-to- hart/discover/places_to_discover-winchfield.htm The parish council was formed in 1894, and since then, the village has continued to slowly expand, with newer properties constructed at Winchfield Hurst and near the Station. Notable buildings =St Mary the Virgin= St Mary the Virgin was built during the 12th century. The church has been hardly altered since its original construction in the 12th century, with the exception of the sixteenth-century south porch and a modern north aisle and top stage of the tower.Home St Mary's Winchfield =The Old School House= The Old School House The Old School was built in 1860‚Äì61 by William Burges. The building is of brick, in the gothic style, with a patterned tiled roof. Its most striking feature is the pair of \\"full height windows with open timberwork gables marking the former schoolroom.\\" Following alteration, the school is now a private residence. Winchfield Festival Winchfield holds a biennial festival, which is centred on Winchfield's 12th-century church. The festival developed from a single musical event initiated sixteen years ago to raise funds to renovate the church organ. Since then the festival has expanded with the help of the local community to include both fun and educational events. The Winchfield Festival is a properly constituted charity, with educational as well as entertainment goals. During the 2006 festival, the festival had jazz performances, a male voice choir, easy classics and the Gould Piano Trio, as well as some classical soloists such as Tasmin Little, John Lenehan and Ll≈∑r Williams.http://www.winchfield.org Proposed new development at Winchfield On 27 November 2014, Hart District Council voted http://www.hart.gov.uk/sites/default/files/4_The_Council/Council_meetings/K_November/14%2011%20C%20Council%20Local%20Plan%20housing%20Strategy%20and%20maps.pdf to test Winchfield as a suitable location for a new settlement of up to 5,000 homes.

Initially conceived to clear up a long-standing problem in quantum field theory (namely, the potential for unconstrained negative energy density at a point), quantum inequalities have proven to have a diverse range of applications. The form of the quantum inequalities is reminiscent of the uncertainty principle. Energy conditions in classical field theory Einstein's theory of General Relativity amounts to a description of the relationship between the curvature of space- time, on the one hand, and the distribution of matter throughout space-time on the other. This precise details of this relationship are determined by the Einstein equations G_{\\\\mu u}=\\\\kappa T_{\\\\mu u}. Here, the Einstein tensor G_{\\\\mu u} describes the curvature of space-time, whilst the energy-momentum tensor T_{\\\\mu u} describes the local distribution of matter. (\\\\kappa is a constant.) The Einstein equations express local relationships between the quantities involved‚Äîspecifically, this is a system of coupled non-linear second order partial differential equations. A very simple observation can be made at this point: the zero-point of energy-momentum is not arbitrary. Adding a \\"constant\\" to the right-hand side of the Einstein equations will effect a change in the Einstein tensor, and thus also in the curvature properties of space-time. All known classical matter fields obey certain \\"energy conditions\\". The most famous classical energy condition is the \\"weak energy condition\\"; this asserts that the local energy density, as measured by an observer moving along a time-like world line, is non-negative. The weak energy condition is essential for many of the most important and powerful results of classical relativity theory‚Äîin particular, the singularity theorems of Hawking et al. Energy conditions in quantum field theory The situation in quantum field theory is rather different: the expectation value of the energy density can be negative at any given point. In fact, things are even worse: by tuning the state of the quantum matter field, the expectation value of the local energy density can be made arbitrarily negative. Inequalities For free, massless, minimally coupled scalar fields, for all \\\\tau_0>0 the following inequality holds along any inertial observer worldline with velocity u^i and proper time \\\\tau: :\\\\frac{\\\\tau_0}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{ \\\\langle T_{ij}u^iu^j\\\\rangle d\\\\tau}{\\\\tau^2+\\\\tau^2_0} \\\\geq -\\\\frac{3}{32\\\\pi^2\\\\tau_0^4}. This implies the averaged weak energy condition as \\\\tau_0 \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty, but also places stricter bounds on the length of episodes of negative energy. Similar bounds can be constructed for massive scalar or electromagnetic fields. Related theorems imply that pulses of negative energy need to be compensated by a larger positive pulse (with magnitude growing with increasing pulse separation). Note that the inequality above only applies to inertial observers: for accelerated observers weaker or no bounds entail. Applications Distributions of negative energy density comprise what is often referred to as exotic matter, and allow for several intriguing possibilities: for example, the Alcubierre drive potentially allows for faster-than-light space travel. Quantum inequalities constrain the magnitude and space-time extent of negative energy densities. In the case of the Alcubierre warp drive mentioned above, the quantum inequalities predict that the amount of exotic matter required to create and sustain the warp drive \\"bubble\\" far exceeds the total mass-energy of the universe. People The earliest investigations into quantum inequalities were carried out by Larry Ford and Tom Roman; an early collaborator was Mitch Pfenning, one of Ford's students at Tufts University. Important work was also carried out by Eanna Flanagan. More recently, Chris Fewster (of the University of York, in the UK) has applied rigorous mathematics to produce a variety of quite general quantum inequalities. Collaborators have included Ford, Roman, Pfenning, Stefan Hollands and Rainer Verch.

On an aircraft so equipped, the wing is designed to rotate on center pivot, so that one tip is swept forward while the opposite tip is swept aft. By changing its sweep angle in this way, drag can be reduced at high speed (with the wing swept) without sacrificing low speed performance (with the wing perpendicular). This is a variation on the classic swing-wing design, intended to simplify construction and retain the center of gravity as the sweep angle is changed. History The oldest examples of this technology are the unrealized German aircraft projects Blohm & Voss P.202 and Messerschmitt Me P.1009-01 from the year 1944, based on a Messerschmitt patent. Fl√ºgelpfeilung und Fl√§chenregel, zwei grundlegende deutsche Patente der Flugzeugaerodynamik (Wing Sweep and Area Rule, two German basic patents of aircraft aerodynamics)., Werner Heinzerling, TU Darmstadt p.7 + 8 (in german)http://www.fzt.haw- hamburg.de/pers/Scholz/dglr/hh/text_2011_03_03_Swept_Wing.pdf German development of the Swept Wing 1935-1945, H.-U. Meier After the war, constructor Dr. Richard Vogt was brought to the US during Operation Paperclip.Scientists & Friends The oblique wing concept was resurrected by Robert T. Jones, an aeronautical engineer at the NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. Analytical and wind tunnel studies initiated by Jones at Ames indicated that a transport-size oblique-wing aircraft, flying at speeds up to Mach 1.4 (1.4 times the speed of sound), would have substantially better aerodynamic performance than aircraft with more conventional wings. In the 1970s, an unmanned propeller-driven aircraft was constructed and tested at Moffett Field.NASA tested the Oblique Wing Research Aircraft in the late 1970s. Its unpleasant flying characteristics at extreme wing-sweep angles discouraged researchers. Known as the NASA Oblique Wing, the project pointed out a craft's unpleasant characteristics at large sweep angles. So far, only one manned aircraft, the NASA AD-1, has been built to explore this concept. It flew a series of flight tests starting in 1979. This aircraft demonstrated a number of serious roll-coupling modes and further experimentation ended. Theory The general idea is to design an aircraft that performs with high efficiency as the Mach number increases from takeoff to cruise conditions (M ~ 0.8, for a commercial aircraft). Since two different types of drag dominate in each of these two flight regimes, uniting high performance designs for each regime into a single airframe is problematic. At low Mach numbers induced drag dominates drag concerns. Airplanes during takeoff and gliders are most concerned with induced drag. One way to reduce induced drag is to increase the effective wingspan of the lifting surface. This is why gliders have such long, narrow wings. An ideal wing has infinite span and induced drag is reduced to a two‚Äìdimensional property. At lower speeds, during takeoffs and landings, an oblique wing would be positioned perpendicular to the fuselage like a conventional wing to provide maximum lift and control qualities. As the aircraft gained speed, the wing would be pivoted to increase the oblique angle, thereby reducing the drag due to wetted area, and decreasing fuel consumption. Alternatively, at Mach numbers increasing towards the speed of sound and beyond, wave drag dominates design concerns. As the aircraft displaces the air, a sonic wave is generated. Sweeping the wings away from the nose of the aircraft can keep the wings aft of the sonic wave, greatly reducing drag. Unfortunately, for a given wing design, increasing sweep decreases the aspect ratio. At high speeds, both subsonic and supersonic, an oblique wing would be pivoted at up to 60 degrees to the aircraft's fuselage for better high-speed performance. The studies showed these angles would decrease aerodynamic drag, permitting increased speed and longer range with the same fuel expenditure. Fundamentally, it appears that no design can be completely optimized for both flight regimes. However, the oblique wing shows promise of getting close. By actively increasing sweep as Mach number increases, high efficiency is possible for a wide range of speeds. It is theorized that an oblique flying wing could drastically improve commercial air transportation, reducing fuel costs and noise in the vicinity of airports. Military operations include the possibility of a long‚Äìendurance fighter/attack vehicle. NASA OFW airliner research There have been investigations into an OFW platform being developed into a transcontinental airliner.Michael Williams blog NASA Ames performed a preliminary design study of a theoretical 500-seat supersonic airliner using the concept in 1991. Following this study, NASA built a small remote-controlled demonstrator aircraft with a 20-foot (6.1m) wingspan. It flew only once, for four minutes in May 1994, but in doing so, it demonstrated stable flight with oblique wing sweep from 35 degrees to 50 degrees. Despite this success, the NASA High Speed Research program, and further oblique wing studies, were canceled. DARPA Oblique Flying-Wing (OFW) Project The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) awarded Northrop Grumman a $10.3 million (USD) contract for risk reduction and preliminary planning for an X-plane OFW demonstrator,G. Warwick - Flight International, No. 5029, Vol. 169, p. 20 known as the Switchblade. That program was eventually cancelled, citing difficulties with control systems. The program aimed at producing a technology demonstrator aircraft to explore the various challenges which the radical design entails. The proposed aircraft would be a pure flying wing (an aircraft with no other auxiliary surfaces such as tails, canards or a fuselage) where the wing is swept with one side of the aircraft forward, and one backwards in an asymmetric fashion.Oblique Flying Wing This aircraft configuration is believed to give it a combination of high speed, long range and long endurance.Oblique Flying Wing, Supersonic Aerodynamics The program entailed two phases. Phase I was to explore the theory and result in a conceptual design, while Phase II covered the design, manufacture and flight test of an aircraft. The program hoped to produce a dataset that can then be used when considering future military aircraft designs. Wind tunnel tests for the aircraft design have been completed. The design was noted to be \\"workable and robust.\\"New Angles: Wind tunnel results point way forward for tailless oblique flying wing study.

Ian retired from first-class cricket in 1984 then worked for Dunlop Slazenger (part of the Pacific Brands group) until his retirement in 2010. Bright start Ian Davis' talent was spotted early and he was selected to tour the West Indies in 1969/70 with the Australian Schoolboys XI. To ensure he could make the trip his local community in Shoalhaven clubbed together to sponsor his journey, something Davis remains grateful for to this day. On tour Davis was chosen to open the batting with another future test player Gary Cosier for the first two matches against Jamaica Under-19s. He scored 11, 8 and 8. In the third tour match against Barbados he scored one run not out batting at four. In his sixth match of the tour Davis scored a magnificent century against Trindad and Tobago Under-19s and backed up with 50 not out in the second innings. He finished the tour averaging a very good 43.71 from the seven matches he played. Davis was in good company on the tour, along with Cosier, Trevor Chappell and Gary Gilmour went on the represent Australia, while Andrew Sincock had a long first-class career with South Australia. Davis made his Sheffield Shield debut for New South Wales in November 1973 against Western Australia at The WACA. Batting at 6 he scored 27 and 25. In his next match Davis scored a first innings 86 against South Australia. Davis' good form was enough to earn him a call-up to the Australian XI to face New Zealand in December 1973 (just a month after debut and aged just 20). A weak New Zealand side were routed by an innings and 25 runs. Davis, batting at 6, scoring 15 runs before being caught behind by Ken Wadsworth off the bowling of Dayle Hadlee. His maiden first-class century came on 18 January 1974 against Victoria. He scored 109 not out against a Victorian bowling line-up including future Australia international Ray Bright and former international Alan Thomson. Davis ended the season top of the NSW batting averages with 52.90 in 12 innings in 7 Sheffield Shield matches, the 109 not out being his only century, with 5 fifties. He was sixth overall in the Shield batting averages, with Greg Chappell top averaging a remarkable 92.09 in 13 innings. Davis was selected for the test series in New Zealand playing in all three tests. He scored his first test fifty in Christchurch in March 1974 scoring exactly 50 runs from 107 balls before being caught by New Zealand captain Bev Congdon off the bowling of Richard Hadlee. It was during this tour that Davis made his ODI debut scoring 11 not out in Dunedin. Davis performed well enough to be included in the Australian squad for the 1974/75 Ashes series at home to England. Although he did not appear in any of the Test matches Davis did face Mike Denness' tourists playing for NSW scoring 4 and 38 batting at 3, being dismissed by Chris Old in both innings. NSW lost the match by 187 runs. The 1974/75 season was a poor one for Davis. He failed to register a first-class century, scoring only one fifty. He played 15 innings in 8 matches averaging only 17.21. His place in the test XI had been taken by the returning Ross Edwards. Australia regained the Ashes in a series famous for the fierce fast bowling of Lillee and Thomson. For the 1975/76 season Davis moved to Queensland. Under the captaincy of Greg Chappell, Davis was chosen to open the batting. Although not as spectacular as his debut season he averaged 34.08 from 12 innings in 8 matches, with a top score of 61. That season Queensland won the Gillette Cup beating Western Australia in the final, Davis scored 44 from 57 balls, in a thrilling 4 run win. The 1976/77 season saw a return to form for Davis, he returned to NSW, after just one season away, and topped their batting averages (53.83) after scoring two hundreds in the first four matches of the Sheffield Shield. Recalled Subsequently Davis was recalled by Australia for the 1976/77 test series at home to Pakistan. Selected to open the batting in the first test at Brisbane he scored his maiden test century (105 off 201 balls) in the first innings but was out for a duck in the second bowled by Sarfraz Nawaz. Davis finished the three match series with an average of 49.00 after scoring fifties in both innings in the second test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (56 and 88). A two test tour to New Zealand followed the Pakistan series. Davis finished the tour with an average of 33.72 and top score of 68 from 12 innings in 6 matches. He scored only 75 runs in the tests with a top score of just 34. The thrilling Centenary Test match against England at the MCG was played in March 1977, Davis scoring a vital 68 in the Aussies' second innings. Australia won the match by 45 runs, Dennis Lillee claiming 11 wickets in the match. The Australian winter of 1977 saw Davis selected in the Ashes party to tour England. Davis played two ODIs on the tour scoring one run in two innings, he never played another ODI. In the six test series Davis was picked in the second, third and fourth tests opening with Rick McCosker. However he scored only 107 (ave. 17.83), his best score of 34 coming in his first test innings at Old Trafford. Following scores of 12, 33, 9, 0 and 19 Davis was dropped and replaced by Craig Serjeant at the top of the order. The fourth test at Headingley would not only be Davis' last test but also the last officially recognised first class match he would play until the 1979/80 season. World Series Cricket Davis was signed by Kerry Packer for World Series Cricket in 1977. As one of the brightest talents in Australia his signature was considered vital for the marketing and success of the brand. In the first year of WSC (1977/78) Davis played 3 Supertests scoring a best of 84 against the World XI. He would play 2 more Supertests in the 1978/79 season scoring just 48 runs (ave. 12). Davis found breaking into the WSC Australian XI just as tough as the official side his path being blocked by McCosker and Bruce Laird. The fact that Davis averaged roughly half as many runs in Supertests as he did in official tests highlights the high level of competition in WSC. It was during the second Supertest that Australian batsman David Hookes suffered a broken jaw from an Andy Roberts bouncer. Packer was said to encourage his bowlers to be aggressive. Traditional cricket followers became shocked by the posturing and bad-language broadcast via pitch microphones. The highly charged atmosphere and Packer's preference for fast bowling led to many of the WSC stars, including Davis, to wear protective helmets. A piece of cricket equipment Davis would later help develop after retirement. Davis had more success in the International Cup (the 40 over competition), which is surprising given he was only selected for three official One-Day Internationals. He played in 18 International Cup matches over the two seasons scoring 428 runs (ave. 25.18) with two fifties (top score 69). Davis was selected for the marquee WSC Tour of the West Indies, however the bank he was employed with refused to grant him leave. So Davis missed out on the tour which signalled the end of World Series Cricket after Packer reached a settlement with the cricketing authorities in May 1979. After World Series Cricket The 1979/80 season saw the Packer players return to their State sides. Although Davis would play only three Sheffield Shield matches that season batting back down the order at 4. The highlight of his being a score of 112 against the new fully participating Tasmania side at Launceston. He failed to pass 50 in any of his other innings. The 1980/81 season was another relatively poor one for Davis. He played 7 matches scoring just 251 runs, with a top score of 91 not out. He finished the season with an average of 27.88. However NSW, under the captaincy of Rick McCosker, finished runners-up in the table only 3 points behind Western Australia. NSW would finish even closer runners-up in 1981/82 just two points behind David Hookes' South Australia. Davis had his best season since 1976/77 averaging 38 with two hundreds, he had moved back to open the batting. His best innings (133) coming against Tasmania at Hobart. Another century followed in the next match, an 8 wicket win against Queensland (113). 1982/83 proved to be Davis' final first- class season. NSW were again runners-up to Western Australia, this time by four points. But Davis played just twice scoring 87 runs. Davis retired aged just 30. His last first-class match being played on 10 February 1983 against the touring Sri Lankans. He scored 14 runs. Davis' autobiography was published in 2004 entitled More Than Cricket' by Brian Wood. In January 2009 Davis revealed that Slazenger were weeks away from releasing a new bat designed by Danny Waugh, a younger brother of former Test stars Steve and Mark, called the Clubba, in competition with Gray-Nicolls, maker of the only 'double-sided' bat in top level cricket, controversially used by New South Wales and Australia opener David Warner. Davis was quoted, \\"The Waugh bat has a slightly longer handle for batsmen who go the tonk, no shoulders and a power zone. While we're marketing for the 50-over form of the game, it can also be used for Twenty20.\\" Although the bat was not released with Slazenger Australia's new 2009 range, some of the design features have been included specifically the \\"power zone\\" and a flatter back to the bat.

The paladin is a holy knight, crusading in the name of good and order, and is a divine spellcaster. From 1st through 3rd edition, paladins were required to maintain the Lawful Good alignment. In addition, compared with other classes the paladin class has one of the most restrictive codes of conduct and paladin characters are expected to demonstrate and embody goodness. Failure to maintain a lawful good alignment or adhere to the code of conduct causes paladins to lose their paladin status and many of their special abilities until they are able to atone. With the introduction of the 4th edition of D&D;, paladins become champions of a chosen deity instead of just righteous warriors, paladins can be of any alignment, and can no longer fall in disgrace and lose their paladinhood. Publication history =Creative origins= The development of the Dungeons & Dragons Paladin, first introduced in the original Greyhawk supplement, was heavily influenced by the fictional character Holger Carlson from Poul Anderson's novel \\"Three Hearts and Three Lions\\", which was in turn based on the epic poetry of the Chansons de geste. Also mentioned as a basis were the paladins of Roland, the Palatine Guard of Augustus deified, the Papal Guard of the same name, and the Christian myths of King Arthur. =Dungeons & Dragons= The paladin was introduced in Supplement I ‚Äì Greyhawk (1975), as a subclass of fighting man. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition= The paladin was one of the standard character classes available in the original Player's Handbook. The paladin was one of five subclasses presented in the original Players Handbook. In the 1st edition of Dungeons & Dragons the paladin class had very high ability score prerequisites, and stipulated that only human characters could be paladins. Despite this, several Dragon magazine articles describe paladins of other races besides human and of other cultures besides the Western European chivalric romance notion of a true Christian knight. In the Players Handbook, paladin appeared as a sub-class, and while a paladin was now much more powerful, paladins have to satisfy more rigorous criteria. When Unearthed Arcana was first published in 1985, the paladin class became a sub-class of the newly introduced cavalier class.Unearthed Arcana, by Gary Gygax, published 1985, =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition= The paladin, as part of the \\"warrior\\" group, was one of the standard character classes available in the second edition Player's Handbook. The second edition Player's Handbook gives several examples of heroes throughout legend and history who could be called paladins: Roland and the 12 Peers of Charlemagne, Sir Lancelot, Sir Gawain, and Sir Galahad. With the release of AD&D; 2nd Edition the paladin class reverted to being tied to the fighter group. With elements of the cavalier class, it was reintroduced as a character kit in The Complete Fighter's Handbook, published in 1989,The Complete Fighter's Handbook, by Aaron Allston, published 1989, and finally got its own recognition in The Complete Paladin's Handbook, published in 1994.The Complete Paladin's Handbook, by Rick Swan, published 1994, As in 1st edition, the paladin class had very high ability score prerequisites, and stipulated that only human characters could be paladins. =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= While there are no specific ability score requirements, a Paladin character in 3rd edition is still advised to have some high scores in order to be effective. These abilities are: * Strength & Constitution: As their class makeup and general honor code favor front-rank combat, Strength and Constitution are both important to Paladins in order to deal and withstand damage in melee. * Charisma: Charisma is key to the Paladin's most crucial abilities: Lay on Hands (for healing) and Smite Evil (to harm malign creatures) both function relative to Charisma bonus, as does Divine Grace, which grants improved saving throws (commonly used to resist harmful magic). Turn Undead is also bolstered by Charisma. * Wisdom: Though generally less critical than Charisma, a good Wisdom score is necessary in order for a Paladin to access divine spells at higher levels. Other Paladin class abilities include the ability to detect evil at will, immunity to fear and disease, the ability to cure disease, the opportunity to use \\"holy avenger\\" swords with imbued divine spells or extra damage to evil creatures, and to summon a \\"special mount\\" ‚Äì usually a heavy warhorse of unusual strength and intelligence. Their spell-casting and Turn Undead abilities are similar to but weaker or more specialized than comparable cleric abilities. Typical tenets of the Paladin code are as follows (though many variants exist): * A Paladin must be of Lawful Good alignment in 3rd edition or earlier. * A Paladin may never willfully commit an Evil act. * A Paladin cannot associate with any character who persistently commits acts which would cause the Paladin him/herself to Fall ‚Äì notably Evil creatures. * A Paladin must remain truthful and forthright at all times. * A Paladin must give fair warning and due quarter to enemies. * A Paladin holds stealth, subterfuge, attack from the rear, missile weapons and especially poison as weapons of last resort. Occasional, necessary, minor deviations are permissible, but a single gross violation of his/her code of conduct will strip the Paladin of powers until he/she Atones. Acts of Evil or alignment shift always qualify. (Atonement typically involves a quest or undertaking by way of penance, but forced or accidental violations may waive this requirement.) The Paladin class is available to all races, although most Paladins are still human. The class is notably uncommon among savage humanoids such as orcs and goblins, where good-aligned beings are rare. Similarly to Monks, Paladins cannot consistently multiclass. Adding levels to any other class permanently halts progression as a Paladin, to reflect the devotion and single-mindedness of purpose expected of the class. However, all class abilities are retained in such cases. Certain feats found in the Complete Adventurer and the Eberron campaign setting permit normal multiclassing (e.g. Eberron's Knight Training feat permits multiclassing with any one chosen class, and permits the same benefit to monk levels if that is the class chosen). Some prestige classes also waive this restriction (typically classes built especially for Paladins). A Fallen Paladin can choose to trade in their levels for equivalent Blackguard powers. Certain accessory products, most notably the Unearthed Arcana, feature variant Paladins such as the Lawful Evil Paladin of Tyranny, the Chaotic Evil Paladin of Slaughter, and the Chaotic Good Paladin of Freedom (with the base Paladin being called \\"Paladin of Honor\\"). Under this scheme, Paladins become complementary to Druids, championing the extreme \\"corner\\" alignments just as Druids are champions of the partly Neutral \\"cross\\" alignments. However, issue 310 of Dragon magazine featured a \\"Paladin\\" for each alignment (for example, a Neutral Good Sentinel). Aasimar have Paladin as their favored class. =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= With the installment of Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, paladins are now champions of a chosen deity rather than just being a righteous warrior. As such, paladins may also have a different alignment from the traditional lawful good, however the paladin's alignment must correspond with his/her chosen god. Another new feature is the permanence of paladinhood. Once a character is ordained as a paladin, he/she cannot fall or have powers stripped in any way. This can allow players to avoid having to \\"police\\" their fellow party members, but depending on one's god, it may be encouraged to curb any excessively evil behavior. It is stated that failing to live up to one's deity's tenets will result in that paladin's compatriots hunting down and judging their wayward members. Smite Evil has also been replaced with various \\"smites\\" and \\"strikes\\" as part of the paladin's power set, which are defined as Prayers (the term used for divine classes' powers). Two builds are presented in the Player's Handbook: the Avenging Paladin, based on Strength and offense, and the Protecting Paladin, based on Charisma and defense. Strength-based attack prayers are generally weapon-based and limited to melee range, while Charisma-based attack prayers include both melee weapon attacks and ranged implement-based attacks. Paladins also have the divine challenge class feature, which causes a targeted opponent to take damage when it makes an attack which doesn't include the paladin, as well as \\"marking\\" that opponent, which penalizes any attack roll the opponent makes against a target other than the marking character. In place of a bonded mount, they can have powers at later levels that allow them to teleport across the battle field to aid endangered allies. The paladin was initially the only class in 4th edition to have plate armor proficiency at first level. Since then, the Knight (a variant of the fighter, first presented in Heroes of the Fallen Lands) and two more paladin variants, the Cavalier (Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms) and the Blackguard (Heroes of Shadow), also have this ability. Paladins may also take special feats related to their deity with their Channel Divinity class feature. Many paladin prayers benefit from high Wisdom, and like clerics, paladins can use holy symbols as implements. Paladins no longer have the innate ability to remove disease or have immunity to diseases or fear, but can gain powers that allow other characters to make saving throws for status ailments that can be ended as such, as well as bolster resistances to negative status effects. Paladins also have the highest amount of healing surges out of any class, which when combined with their lay on hands ability, allows them to act as emergency healers. In 4th edition, Paladins use the standard multiclassing rules instead of having special multiclassing restrictions like they did in the previous edition. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The paladin has been included as a character class in the 5th edition Player's Handbook. In 5th Edition, paladins commit themselves to a path that obeys a certain set of tenets, and can choose one of a number of sacred oaths that encompasses the nature of their quest: *Oath of Devotion: paladins who appeal to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and honor. Those who take this oath are Lawful Good, following the tenets of honesty, courage, compassion, honor, and duty. Nicknamed cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors. *Oath of the Ancients: paladins who cast their lot in with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life- giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. Those who take this oath are typically Neutral Good, putting the principles of good above concerns of law or chaos, and follow the tenets of Kindling the Light, Sheltering the Light, Preserving Their Own Light, and Being the Light. Nicknamed fey knights, green knights, or horned knights. *Oath of Vengeance: a solemn commitment to punishing those who have committed grievous sins. Those who take this oath are typically either Lawful Neutral or Neutral due to their willingness to forsake their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil. Their tenets are simple: Fight the Greater Evil, No Mercy for the Wicked, By Any Means Necessary, and Restitution. Nicknamed avengers or dark knights. * Oath of Conquest: These paladins are those who seek glory in battle and subjection of their enemies, since to these paladins (known as iron mongers or knight tyrants) it isn't enough to just establish order; they must also vigorously crush the forces of chaos and evil. These Paladins toe the line between hero and villain in their neverending quest to squash evil evident by the fact that even archdevils such as Bel as one his more ardent supporters. With their tenets being Douse the Flames of Hope, Rule with an Iron Fist and Strength of Above All. This oath is found in Xanathar's Guide to Everything. * Oath of Redemption: Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Their tenets are Peace, Innocence, Patience and Wisdom. This oath is found in Xanathar's Guide to Everything. * Oath of the Crown: Paladins who follow this path are sworn to the ideals of civilization, serving society and the just laws that hold the society together. Their tenets are usually set by the sovereign they serve but generally include: Law, Loyalty, Courage and Responsibility. This oath is found in Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide. Paladins can be any of alignment, although evil paladins are extremely rare. However, their oath and their alignment can either be in harmony, or their oath might represent standards that they have not yet attained. The 5th edition Dungeon Master's Guide includes an entry for Oathbreaker paladins, including class features and a quick guideline for atonement. The Anti-Paladin An article in the July 1980 issue 39 of Dragon magazine introduced a new non-player character to Dungeons & Dragons, the evil opposite of the Paladin, the Anti-Paladin. The article stated \\"The Anti-Paladin represents everything that is mean, low and despicable in the human race.\\" Introduced first in the original Fiend Folio, the Death Knight is an undead paladin that has fallen from grace and has died before seeking atonement. Campaign settings =Dark Sun= Paladins do not exist in Athas. =Eberron= In the Eberron campaign setting, the most famous paladins belong to the religion of the Silver Flame, and are known for their monotheistic worship and their crusades against lycanthropes and demons. The Silver Flame religion venerates the paladin Tira Miron, who sacrificed herself to defeat a powerful demon. =Forgotten Realms= All paladins in the Forgotten Realms are devoted to patron deities of either Law or Good, and often permitted to obtain special training based on the divine portfolio of their patron deity. Lord Piergieron, leader of the Lords of Waterdeep (the most prominent city in the Forgotten Realms), is a paladin. In video games The paladin's specialties in most Dungeons & Dragons video games are its high defense, its ability to cast spells and especially its proficiency against undead monsters. Software versions of Dungeons & Dragons such as Neverwinter Nights often loosen the requirements for playing a paladin to simply being lawful good in alignment, and the paladin's unique position and alignment restriction is very rarely apparent in these software versions (with the exception of The Temple of Elemental Evil) where the paladin can search dead bodies and unprotected chests and lockers without moral penalties. This bothers many \\"hardcore\\" pen-and-paper role-players who see the paladin's limitations as part of what makes it an interesting class to play. For example, in the game Icewind Dale II paladins will often refuse the rewards for quests if they represent the party to the quest giver, since \\"[the] paladins of Icewind Dale do not accept monetary gain for their just deeds.\\" Paladins are more rarely represented in early role-playing video games.  Reception  Screen Rant rated the paladin class as the 4th most powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition. The Gamer rated the 5th edition paladin subclass Oath Of Conquest as the 4th most awesome subclass out of the 32 new character options in Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything. Gus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \\"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D; Beyond from\\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, paladins were 7th in player creations at 8,840 total. Human (2,326) was the most common racial combination followed by dragonborn (1,688) and then dwarf (971). Wezerek wrote \\"when I started playing 'Dungeons & Dragons' five years ago, I never would have chosen the game‚Äôs most popular match: the human fighter. There are already enough human fighters in movies, TV and books ‚Äî my first character was an albino dragonborn sorcerer. But these days I can get behind the combo‚Äôs simplicity\\".

The programme was on air from February 2001 to March 2011 and was broadcast each weekday morning between 10:00am and 12:45pm, and later 13:00-16:00 each weekend afternoon. And Bank Holidays And Good Fridays At 10.00‚Äì13.00 Show format The show began at 10:00am and lasted for two and three quarter hours every day. News and sport was read at 10:30am and 11:30am And Bank Holidays And Good Fridays at 12.30. It also featured the latest entertainment news with Natalie Jamieson at 12:00pm. In addition the show had a number of features as well as guests and live music performances from well-known artists. The show handed over to Newsbeat at 12:45. History Jo Whiley had a weekday lunchtime show from February 1997. This was originally called The Jo Whiley Show, but later changed its name to The Lunchtime Social. This included elements of the evening show, such as tour dates and occasional live 'sessions' at Maida Vale Studios while working within the restrictions of Radio 1's daytime schedule. When Simon Mayo left BBC Radio 1 for BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Radio 2 in February 2001, Whiley's show was moved to a mid morning slot and regained its original name. In July 2008 The Jo Whiley Show was fined ¬£75,000 for misleading listeners, along with other BBC programmes totaling ¬£400,000 The incident involved a member of BBC staff posing as a member of the public taking part in a competition. The BBC claim Whiley herself was unaware of the deception at the time of its broadcast. In July 2009 it was announced that the Jo Whiley show would finish broadcasting on weekdays on Radio 1 in September as part of a major shake up of the station's weekday schedule. The shake up would see Greg James move to the afternoon slot (then occupied by Edith Bowman), and Fearne Cotton move to Whiley's slot. Cotton took over many of Whiley's popular features including the famous Live Lounge segment. Whiley's final weekday program took place on 18 September 2009, and her final weekend programme took place on 27 March 2011. Features There were numerous features on the show. Features which were running at the weekday show's are marked in bold type: *Changing Tracks ‚Äì Daily feature ‚Äì This is when a listener would email in and ask for a song that reminded them of a time in their life when music changed everything, particularly if that had had a great experience or whether a song provided some kind of comfort after a traumatic time. This feature was similar to former BBC Radio 1 DJ Simon Bates's Our Tune. *Live Lounge ‚Äì Where invited artists would come into the studio to perform music from their new album/single as well as performing a cover version of a song they particularly admired. They would give their own take on it. Selected guests included Goldfrapp and Nelly Furtado Florence + the Machine's version of Halo by Beyonc√© was stated to be the best cover in the history of the Live Lounge when it was performed in 2009. This was a popular feature of the show and several compilation albums of such covered music have been released. *Pet Sound ‚Äì Daily feature ‚Äì A song considered by Jo to be something that we need to hear. It usually had not been released or was due to be released in due time. This song would be played once on Jo's show for the week and it changed every week. *Marilyn Manson was never in The Wonder Years ‚Äì This happened infrequently. Basically if there was a question that a listener did not know the answer to and would like answered, then this was the place to find out. The title comes from the urban legend that Marilyn Manson was a cast member for the series The Wonder Years when actually he wasn't. *I Have Never... ‚Äì An occasional feature where Jo embarked on something she had never done in her life. Listeners were also challenged to the same thing, examples including not watching television for a whole week and trying a sport for the very first time. *What Rocked? What Sucked? ‚Äì This feature involved listeners e-mailing or texting the show to tell Jo and the listening audience what went well and what didn't. Jo sometimes offered her own view from time to time. This feature took place on a Friday allowing listeners to reflect upon the good and bad points of the week that had passed. *7 Song Shuffle ‚Äì Daily feature ‚Äì A mishmash of seven different songs would be played to a listener via telephone and they would then be given around 45 seconds to name the artist and song title. The number of correct answers they got corresponded to the number of albums they would receive as prizes. The actual prize was vouchers for popular music store HMV, which came in ¬£10 denominations to represent the number of albums. If not all seven songs were guessed correctly then other listeners could claim them by texting or emailing the missing answers. It was more difficult than it appeared, as the contestants had to listen to the jumbled tracks on the telephone rather than the radio, making the songs harder to differentiate. In the show's eight-year run, only four people correctly answered all seven songs. After 17 July 2007 the game became 'just for fun' with listeners playing along at home and no prizes on offer due to the BBC's suspension of all telephone competitions. *We Love Mondays ‚Äì Weekly feature ‚Äì At the start of each week, Jo would run through various reasons to be happy on a Monday morning, such as what was showing at the cinema, what music albums and singles were being released and what was coming up on television and radio. *Ask the Experts ‚Äì Weekly feature ‚Äì For this feature, listeners were able to e-mail in their dilemmas or questions to a certain expert, whether it be about video games, gadgets or relationships. Tracey Cox was one of the experts, with her field being relationships. The full list of experts featured in this section was; *Martin Lewis ‚Äì Money *Angela Buttolph ‚Äì Fashion *Johnny Minkley ‚Äì Video Games *Tracey Cox ‚Äì Relationships *Tom Dunmore ‚Äì Gadgets *Natalie Jamieson ‚Äì Entertainment News *Mark Chapman ‚Äì Sport Weekend show's features include; *Jo's Road Trip *Top of the Shops *SpellStar *Live Lounge (same as her former weekday mid-morning show) References  External links  * Category:BBC Radio 1 programmes Category:British music radio programmes ","title":"The Jo Whiley Show"},{"id":"3615941","title":"Linux Game Publishing"},{"id":"3615945","text":"John Smith (4 January 1939 ‚Äì February 1988) was an English footballer.

Both are used for histology staining and biophysical studies of protein aggregation. In particular, these dyes have been used since 1989 to investigate amyloid formation. They are also used in biophysical studies of the electrophysiology of bacteria. Thioflavins are corrosive, irritants, and are acutely toxic, causing serious eye damage. Thioflavin T has been used in research into Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. Thioflavin T Thioflavin T (Basic Yellow 1, Methylene yellow, CI 49005, or ThT) is a benzothiazole salt obtained by the methylation of dehydrothiotoluidine with methanol in the presence of hydrochloric acid. The dye is widely used to visualize and quantify the presence of misfolded protein aggregates called amyloid, both in vitro and in vivo (e.g., plaques composed of amyloid beta found in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients). When it binds to beta sheet-rich structures, such as those in amyloid aggregates, the dye displays enhanced fluorescence and a characteristic red shift of its emission spectrum.H. LeVine III, Methods in Enzymology. 309, 274 (1999) Additional studies also consider fluorescence changes as result of the interaction with double stranded DNA. This change in fluorescent behavior can be caused by many factors that affect the excited state charge distribution of thioflavin T, including binding to a rigid, highly-ordered nanopocket, and specific chemical interactions between thioflavin T and the nanopocket. Prior to binding to an amyloid fibril, thioflavin T emits weakly around 427 nm. Quenching effects of the nearby excitation peak at 450 nm is suspected to play a role in minimizing emissions. When excited at 450 nm, thioflavin T produces a strong fluorescence signal at approximately 482 nm upon binding to amyloids. Thioflavin T molecule consists of a benzylamine and a benzathiole ring connected through a carbon-carbon bond. These two rings can rotate freely when the molecule is in solution. The free rotation of these rings results in quenching of any excited state generated by photon excitation. However, when thioflavin T binds to amyloid fibrils, the two rotational planes of the two rings become immobilized and therefore, this molecule can maintain its excited state. Thioflavin T fluorescence is often used as a diagnostic of amyloid structure, but it is not perfectly specific for amyloid. Depending on the particular protein and experimental conditions, thioflavin T may or may not undergo a spectroscopic change upon binding to precursor monomers, small oligomers, unaggregated material with a high beta sheet content, or even alpha helix-rich proteins. Conversely, some amyloid fibers do not affect thioflavin T fluorescence, raising the prospect of false negative results. In adult C. elegans, exposure to thioflavin T results \\"in a profoundly extended lifespan and slowed aging\\" at some levels, but decreased lifespan at higher levels. Thioflavin S Thioflavin S is a homogenous mixture of compounds that results from the methylation of dehydrothiotoluidine with sulfonic acid. It is also used to stain amyloid plaques. Like thioflavin T it binds to amyloid fibrils but not monomers and gives a distinct increase in fluorescence emission. However unlike thioflavin T, it does not produce a characteristic shift in the excitation or emission spectra. This latter characteristic of thioflavin S results in high background fluorescence, making it unable to be used in quantitative measurements of fibril solutions. Another dye that is used to identify amyloid structure is Congo red.

The Monongah mining disaster of Monongah, West Virginia occurred on December 6, 1907, and has been described as \\"the worst mining disaster in American history\\". The explosion occurred in Fairmont Coal Company‚Äôs No. 6 and No. 8 mines, and was one of the contributing events leading to the creation of the United States Bureau of Mines. The disaster Rescuers going into the mouth of the No. 6 mine, newspaper photo. On Friday, December 6, 1907, there were officially 367 men in the two mines, although the actual number was much higher as officially registered workers often took their children and other relatives into the mine to help. At 10:28 AM an explosion occurred that killed most of the men inside the mine instantly. The blast caused considerable damage to both the mine and the surface. The ventilation systems, necessary to keep fresh air supplied to the mine, were destroyed along with many railcars and other equipment. Inside the mine the timbers supporting the roof were blown down which caused further issues as the roof collapsed. An official cause of the explosion was not determined, but investigators at the time believed that an electrical spark or one of the miners' open flame lamps ignited coal dust or methane gas.Humphrey, H. B. Historical Summary of Coal-Mine Explosions in the United States, 1810‚Äì1958. Washington D.C.. UNT Digital Library. https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc12740/. Accessed February 27, 2014. Pg. 27‚Äì28 Rescue attempts Artistic view of the explosion at the No. 8 mine. During the early days of coal mining, time was of the essence to bring people out alive. The first volunteer rescuers entered the two mines twenty- five minutes after the initial explosion. The biggest threats to rescuers are the various fumes, particularly ‚Äúblackdamp‚Äù, a mix of carbon dioxide and nitrogen that contains no oxygen, and ‚Äúwhitedamp‚Äù, which is carbon monoxide. The lack of breathing apparatus at the time made venturing into these areas impossible. Rescuers could only stay in the mine for 15 minutes at a time.McAteer, Monongah, 132. In a vain effort to protect themselves, some of the miners tried to cover their faces with jackets or other pieces of cloth. While this may filter out particulate matter, it would not protect the miners in an oxygen-free environment.McAteer, Monongah, 134. The toxic fume problems were compounded by the infrastructural damage caused by the initial explosion: mines require large ventilation fans to prevent toxic gas buildup, and the explosion at Monongah had destroyed all of the ventilation equipment. The inability to clear the mine of gases transformed the rescue effort into a recovery effort. One Polish miner was rescued and four Italian miners escaped. The official death toll stood at 362, 171 of them Italian migrants. As a result of the explosion, along with other disasters, the public began demanding additional oversight to help regulate the mines. In 1910 Congress created the United States Bureau of Mines, with the goal of investigating and inspecting mines to reduce explosions and to limit the waste of human and natural resources. In addition the Bureau of Mines set up field officers that would train mine crews, provide rescue services, and investigate disasters when they do occur.Humphrey, Historical Summaries of Coal Mine Explosions, 34‚Äì35. In 2003, to commemorate the explosion, the Italian commune of San Giovanni in Fiore, from which many of the miners had emigrated, erected a memorial with the inscription Per non dimenticare minatori calabresi morti nel West Virginia (USA). Il sacrificio di quegli uomini forti tempri le nuove generazioni. Monongah, 6 dicembre 1907; San Giovanni in Fiore, 6 dicembre 2003 (\\"Lest we forget the Calabrian miners dead in West Virginia (USA). The sacrifice of those strong men shall bolster new generations. Monongah, December 6, 1907, San Giovanni in Fiore, December 6, 2003\\") In 2007, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the explosion, the Italian region of Molise presented a bell to the town of Monongah. Today the bell sits in the Monongah town square. In 2009, the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, conferred the honor of \\"Stella al Merito del Lavoro\\" (Star of Reward of Work) upon the victims of the disaster. In 2020, Fallout 76 featured a tribute to the Monongah mining disaster in the form of an optional quest.

It is also known as the Bathgate branch and was originally operated by the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway. Except for the short section at the original Bathgate terminus, the main line is still in use, with a frequent passenger train service operated by Abellio ScotRail. Extension to Airdrie and Glasgow In 2005, the Scottish Executive declared that in line with plans to upgrade the unfinished part of the A8 to motorway standard, public transport links between Glasgow and Edinburgh must also be improved. The closed section of the Bathgate and Coatbridge Railway between the 1989 Drumgelloch station and Bathgate was rebuilt and electrified, connecting with the North Clyde Line at Drumgelloch. This opened up an important fourth railway link between Glasgow and Edinburgh, giving many towns in West Lothian better connections to the Greater Glasgow conurbation. From 12 December 2010, the Edinburgh to Bathgate service was absorbed into the North Clyde Line with services from and via . All work on the extension was completed by 8 March 2011. History The Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway was opened from a junction near Ratho to Bathgate, in 1849. The owning company immediately leased the line to the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway. From the following year, shale oil was extracted in the area, and the line became very successful from that traffic. Other railways joined at Bathgate and the line later became part of a through route from Edinburgh to Glasgow via Airdrie. In 1956 the passenger service was withdrawn, but it was reinstated from Edinburgh to Bathgate in 1986. In 2010 the through route to Airdrie and Glasgow was reopened and electrified, and the line continues in heavy passenger use at the present day. =Authorisation and opening= System map of the Edinburgh and Bathgate RailwayThe Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway (E&BR;) was authorised by Act of Parliament on 3 August 1846. The main line of 11 miles (17 km) was to run to Bathgate, then an important manufacturing town, from a junction near Ratho on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway main line.Awdry says on the Slamannan Railway, but that is wrong; the Slamannan came no nearer than Manuel. In addition there were to be branches to Midcalder, to Binny Quarries, from Barrack to Whitburn, and a loop from Whitburn to Bathgate, though in fact only one of these was built by the E&BR.; The authorised capital was ¬£250,000. Two subsequent Acts, in 1847 and 1848, authorised deviations. The engineer for the work was Thomas Grainger. The only branch that was built by the E&BR; was to Uphall, and from there a mineral railway extension ran to the Binny Quarry, near Ecclesmachan. The main line to Bathgate was opened on 12 November 1849. The company had been encouraged by the E&GR;, and the E&BR; leased its line to the E&GR; for 999 years from the date of opening. The lease charge was 4% of the capital cost of the line plus a proportion of receipts.The lease charge was complex; the E&GR; were to pay to the E&BR; \\"an annual fixed rent ... equal to four per cent. on [the cost of constructing the line, and also] a further fluctuating and contingent rent, or consideration, equal to one-half of the whole receipts ... after deducting the said fixed rent of four per cent., and a sum equal to 33 per cent. on such gross receipts in respect of the expense of maintaining and working the [line]\\".Some sources are unclear about the status of the company. Ross says (page 72) that it was \\"vested\\" in the E&GR; for 999 years from 31 July 1852, and it \\"passed into the NBR embrace in 1865\\". In fact the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway Company remained in existence until 1922, but the physical line was leased to the E&GR;, and the lease passed to the NBR when it took over the E&GR; in 1865. As a shell company the E&BR; Company remained in existence until the grouping of the railways in 1923 (see below). The initial stations from Bathgate Junction (near Ratho) were Broxburn, Houston, and Bathgate. =Developments at Bathgate= Bathgate was an established centre of traditional industries when the line was proposed, but the situation was revolutionised when James Young, an industrial chemist, had developed an industrial process of manufacturing paraffin from torbanite, a type of oil shale. He had obtained a patent for the process in October 1850, and the torbanite had been discovered on the Torbanehill estate, about halfway between Bathgate and Whitburn. Young joined in partnership with Edward William Binney and Edward Meldrum and the Bathgate Works started operations in February 1851. This was the first commercial oil works in the world. When the torbanite was exhausted, shale rocks were exploited, at Bathgate and elsewhere in the locality, and although they had an inferior oil content they were nonetheless commercially desirable. The Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway built a branch line from the E&BR; line to Blackhall, connecting Young's oil processing plant; the line opened in 1850 and diverged from the E&BR; immediately east of the Bathgate station. The Monkland Railways too wished to reach the area and they extended their line eastward from Blackstone Junction (on the former Slamannan Railway) and from Armadale, both routes reaching Bathgate in 1855, and connecting the town to Airdrie and Coatbridge, via the rope-worked Ballochney Railway section of the Monkland Railways. The rope worked sections were by- passed by the \\"new line\\" by 1859, but it was not until 1871 that a direct NBR line between Coatbridge and Glasgow was available. Numerous mineral branches were built from the E&BR; line to nearby points of extraction. =The North British Railway= The Edinburgh and Glasgow was absorbed by the North British Railway on 1 August 1865; the E&GR; had itself absorbed the Monkland Railways the previous day. In 1866 the E&BR; Company was opposing NBR Bills for direct access to certain mineral sites, which would reduce NBR dependency on the E&BR.; The NBR board set about a scheme to purchase the E&BR; company outright, and agreed terms of 5% on capital for seven years, then rising to 5.5%, as well as accepting all of the E&BR;'s debenture debt. However a shareholders' meeting threw out the scheme. At the E&BR; half-yearly meeting on 10 August 1866 the E&BR; chairman regretted the loss of the arrangement, blaming factions within the NBR. In 1869 the NBR built a branch to Pumpherston Oil Works and Camps brickworks (from Houston) and in 1875 to Seafield Oil Works (from West Calder Branch Junction). In 1897 the NBR opened the chord at Bathgate allowing through running from north (Blackstone) to east (towards Edinburgh). =Passenger services= In 1895 there were seven passenger trains daily on the line, with two more on Saturdays; some of these were semi-fast, running through from Edinburgh to Glasgow. =Bangour Private Railway= In June 1904 the first patients were admitted to Bangour Village Hospital, a mental hospital near Dechmont. The road network in the district was inadequate, and the large premises would require a considerable volume of general stores as well as coal. A private branch railway was opened to the public on 19 June 1905 from the E&BR; line, authorised by the Edinburgh and District Lunacy Board Act, 30 July 1900. (The line may have been used before the official opening date in connection with construction of the hospital.) It was worked by the North British Railway, and there was an intermediate station at Dechmont, available to the general public, and many of the staff lived at Dechmont and used the railway for travel to the hospital. Bangour station was considered private, and tickets issued to and from it were marked \\"Bangour (Private)\\". The terms of operation by the NBR required the hospital to guarantee an income of ¬£1,500 annually to the NBR. It was estimated that the actual income was ¬£300 a year, so that the subsidy amounted to ¬£1,200. The hospital was extensively used during World War I for treatment of wounded soldiers, and the road network was correspondingly improved. After the war, the necessity for the railway was diminished and it was closed on 1 August 1921, although passenger services probably ceased on 4 May 1921. =The twentieth century= The Edinburgh and Bathgate line in 1906In the first decades of the twentieth century, the shale oil industry was at its height, and numerous mineral lines were connected to the Bathgate line serving shale pits and oil works, where the oil was extracted from the mineral. However the availability of cheaper liquid oil supplies from the Middle East and elsewhere reduced the demand for shale oil, and the industry declined sharply by 1918. In 1923 the North British Railway became a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway following the Railways Act 1921, and the government again reorganised the railways in 1948, when the Scottish Region of the nationally owned British Railways took charge. Bathgate remained a manufacturing base, as the former Albion Motors plant was now operated by Leyland Motors, but passenger use of the line had declined heavily and on 8 January 1956 the passenger service was withdrawn. A sporadic goods service continued, but the line was sustained by the motor vehicle manufacturing activity. Some passenger use of the line for seasonal trains continued until 1960. =Mid-century developments= The road traffic congestion in Edinburgh became increasingly difficult in the 1970s and 1980s. In addition, Livingston New Town had now developed considerably from a slow start,Livingston was designated as a new town in 1962, although the intention was first declared in 1946. The growth of the urban area eventually filled the space between the former E&BR; line and the Shotts line to Edinburgh. A new station opened on the latter line on 6 October 1984. and a scheme was prepared to reopen the E&BR; line as a branch from the Edinburgh and Glasgow main line to Bathgate, following the original E&BR; main line. =Reopening= Having only carried freight traffic to and from Bathgate (mainly automotive traffic) since passenger services ceased over the line in 1956, the line was reopened to passenger services on 24 March 1986 by British Rail. Lothian Regional Council provided substantial funding toward the project, which was intended to help ease commuting difficulties to and from Edinburgh as road congestion worsened in the mid 1980s, and to alleviate some of the hardship caused by West Lothian's industrial decline. (Since passenger services had ceased in 1956, the remaining shale oil industry became extinct, coal mining was virtually ended in 1984‚Äì1986 by the Thatcher government, and the Bathgate plant of British Leyland was slated for closure.) Economies were made in the project delivery - specifically three miles of railway were removed and between Cawburn Jn and Carmondean Jn, a single line was provided, serving Uphall railway station and Livingston North railway station. The passenger line continued to the terminus at Bathgate while a freight only line (the former Down line) ran between Carmondean Jn and Bathgate yard. The line succeeded in respect of patronage; usage was well above predictions and over the years, Sunday trains were introduced, and the basic weekday service doubled from hourly to every thirty minutes each way during peak hours. From the lines reopening in 1986 by British Rail until electrification, passenger train services were operated by diesel multiple units (at first mainly Class 101s, then from 1987 mainly Class 150s and then (2008‚Äì9) Class 158 or Class 170s.) Following completion of the Airdrie‚ÄìBathgate rail link and electrification of the route resulting in the incorporation of the service into the North Clyde Line timetable, services has been operated by Class 334 electric multiple units. Delay in the delivery and commissioning of the Class 380 resulted in diesel services operating initially between Edinburgh and Bathgate.

It was identified in late 2004 in a seven-month-old child with bronchiolitis in the Netherlands. The virus is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus which enters its host cell by binding to ACE2. Infection with the virus has been confirmed worldwide, and has an association with many common symptoms and diseases. Associated diseases include mild to moderate upper respiratory tract infections, severe lower respiratory tract infection, croup and bronchiolitis. The virus is found primarily in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory illness. It also has a seasonal association in temperate climates. A study performed in Amsterdam estimated the presence of HCoV-NL63 in approximately 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses. The virus originated from infected palm civets and bats. Estimates of its divergence from another coronavirus (HCoV-229E) are around 1000 years ago: it has likely circulated in humans for centuries. The evolution of HCoV-NL63 appears to have involved recombination between an ancestral NL63-like virus circulating in African Triaenops afer bats and a CoV 229E-like virus circulating in Hipposideros bats.Tao Y, Shi M, Chommanard C, Queen K, Zhang J, Markotter W, Kuzmin IV, Holmes EC, Tong S. Surveillance of Bat Coronaviruses in Kenya Identifies Relatives of Human Coronaviruses NL63 and 229E and Their Recombination History. J Virol. 2017 Feb 14;91(5):e01953-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01953-16. Print 2017 Mar 1. PMID: 28077633 Recombinant viruses can arise when two viral genomes are present in the same host cell. Symptoms The first cases of the infection with HCoV- NL63 were found in young children with severe lower respiratory tract infections admitted to hospitals. While the clinical presentation of the virus can be severe, it has also been found in mild cases of respiratory infection. The comorbidity of HCoV-NL63 with other respiratory infections, has made the specific symptoms of the virus difficult to pinpoint. A study of clinical symptoms in HCoV-NL63 patients without secondary infection, reported the most common symptoms to be fever, cough, rhinitis, sore throat, hoarseness, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and croup. An early study investigating children with lower respiratory tract illness, found that HCoV-NL63 was more commonly found in outpatients than hospitalized patients, suggesting that it is a common cold virus similar to HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which generally cause less severe symptoms. However, the high frequency of croup is specific to HCoV-NL63 infection. Cause Seasonal distribution of HCoV-NL63 shows a preferential detection in the period between November and March It is believed that the route of HCoV-NL63 spread is through direct person-to-person transmission in highly populated areas. The virus can survive for up to a week outside of the body in aqueous solutions at room temperature and three hours on dry surfaces. Most people will be infected with a coronavirus in their lifetime, but some populations are more susceptible to HCoV-NL63. These population include children under the age of 5, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. The virus seems to have seasonal incidence, occurring most frequently in the winter months in temperate climates. In more extreme and tropical climates the virus has no preference toward a particular season. Many studies have reported the co-occurrence of HCoV-NL63 with other human coronavirus, Influenza A virus, Human orthopneumovirus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, and Human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Mechanism Transmission of HCoV-NL63 is likely through droplet expulsion from the respiratory tract, which may be airborne or spread through close personal contact. The virus is able to survive for up to seven days in respiratory secretions and remains infective at room temperature. Once the virus has entered the host it binds to cellular receptors using spike proteins, similar to those found in HIV-1. The virus is able to use Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an entry receptor to bind to and enter target cells. No determination of the specific entry of the virus into the host cell has been completed. Therefore, entrance into the cell is either through direct cell fusion with the plasma membrane or endocytosis followed by fusion with the membrane. Due to the lack of a cDNA clone of HCoV-NL63, research on the replication cycle is limited. Because it is a positive single-stranded RNA virus, the processes of replication via transcription and translation can be carried out in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Diagnosis It is difficult to distinguish between symptoms caused by infection of the HCoV-NL63 virus and those caused by other common human viruses, making diagnosis and detection complex. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of samples collected through nasopharyngeal swab is the most commonly used method for detection of the virus. Viral culture or blood serum testing for antibodies may also be used for the confirmation of infection. Prevention The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends several measures for the prevention of infection with HCoV-NL63 including: washing hands often with soap and water, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and not touching the eyes, mouth, or nose. Treatment and prognosis Treatment for the HCoV-NL63 virus is dependent on the severity of associated symptomology. Most mild to moderate infections will go away on their own. Symptoms can be relieved by taking a pain reliever or fever medication, taking a hot shower, or using a humidifier. Antiviral treatment may be necessary for infected patients that end up in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to acute respiratory infection. Intravenous immunoglobulin is an FDA approved HCoV-NL63 inhibitor that is also used to treat primary immune deficiency, RSV, and Kawasaki disease. Virology HCoV-NL63 is one of seven known coronaviruses to infect humans. The other six are: *Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) *Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) *Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) *Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) *Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-1) *Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Recent research Recent data suggest an association of HCoV-NL63 infection with Kawasaki disease, a systemic vasculitis in childhood that may result in aneurysms of the coronary arteries. In the developed world, Kawasaki disease is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children. Further analysis of HCoV-NL63 pathogenicity seems warranted, in particular because of recent evidence that this virus uses the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV (ACE2). HCoV-NL63 has also been found in the intestinal tract of infected individuals and linked to gastroenteritis. This type of infection is the direct result of the viral invasion of the mucosal lining of the intestines. The role of HCoV-NL63 in gastroenteritis is unclear due to typical coinfection with other viruses in this condition. HCoV- NL63 is likely under-detected due its role in many mild to moderate respiratory infections and comorbidity with other disease. Researchers have suggested that more comprehensive, population-based studies are necessary to determine the effects of this virus on systems outside of the respiratory tract.

Vasile Voiculescu (, literary pseudonym V. Voiculescu; 27 November 1884 - 26 April 1963) was a Romanian poet, short-story writer, playwright, and physician. Biography =Early life and education= Voiculescu was born in P√¢rscov, BuzƒÉu County, Romania, to a family of wealthy peasants. He attended primary school in Ple»ôcoi, a village near his home, for a year, after which he was sent to a boarding school in BuzƒÉu. He attended high school in BuzƒÉu, then in Bucharest -- the Gheorghe LazƒÉr High School, where he befriended George Ciprian, an aspiring actor at that time, and the young writer Urmuz. Upon graduating high school in 1902, he read philosophy for a year at the University of Bucharest before starting his medical studies at the Faculty of Medicine. He became a doctor of medicine in 1910. =Prominence= March 1912 marked Voiculescu's debut as a poet with Dor (\\"Longing\\"), a poem first published in Convorbiri Literare. He managed to publish a volume of poems in 1916, but the German Empire forces occupying Bucharest (see Romanian Campaign (World War I)) destroyed all copies. In 1918, he published the volume Din »õara zimbrului (\\"From the Land of the Wisent\\"). Between the two world wars, he lived in Bucharest and held a series of public conferences on medicine, broadcast on radio and aimed primarily at peasant audiences. He wrote poetry of religious persuasion, themed around the birth of Christ, Magi, and Crucifixion. His literary style gradually became Expressionistic. Voiculescu published several short stories, such as Capul de zimbru (\\"Wisent Head\\"); novels, such as Zahei orbul (\\"Zahei the Blind\\"), and plays: Duhul pƒÉm√¢ntului (\\"Earth's Ghost\\"), Demiurgul (\\"The Demiurge\\"), GimnasticƒÉ sentimentalƒÉ (\\"Sentimental Gymnastics\\"), Pribeaga (\\"The Wanderer\\"). =Imprisonment and release= After World War II, Romanian communist authorities attacked and persecuted Voiculescu for his religious and democratic ideals, and did not allow him to publish. He was imprisoned in 1958, at the age of 74, and he spent the following four years in prison; he became ill during detention, dying of cancer a few months after his release. His final work, Shakespeare's Last Imagined Sonnets in the Imaginary Translation of..., comprises 90 sonnets, written between 1954 and 1958. An intricate portrayal of love in all its glory, it was published after his death. In 1990, he was posthumously elected member of the Romanian Academy. His house in P√¢rscov became the Vasile Voiculescu memorial house. Also, the county library in BuzƒÉu bears his name. =Works= *Ultimele sonete ale lui Shakespeare/Les derniers sonnets de Shakespeare (Paralela, 2005).

He is usually described as a pupil of Antonio Zucchi and Angelica Kauffman and as a fruit and flower painter to the Prince Regent.Samuel Redgrave. Dictionary of Artists of the English School: Painters, Sculptors, Architects, Engravers and Ornamentists. London, 1874; Dictionary of National Biography. Vol.3, 1885; Desmond, Ray, Ellwood, Christine. Dictionary of British and Irish Botanists and Horticulturists. London, 1994, p.74. Two of his large-scale paintings ‚Äî altarpieces The Deposition from the Cross (1781) and The Apparition of Our Lord to St Thomas (1784) are in Wolverhampton, and can be seen today at St John's church and at St Peter & St Paul's Roman Catholic church. During Barney's lifetime, his artistic achievements were respected and praised. In 1798, Stebbing Shaw, mentioning The Deposition from the Cross in his History of Staffordshire, called Barney a \\"native genius\\" of Wolverhampton.Shaw, Stebbing. History of Staffordshire. Vol.2, part.1. 1798. P.164. In the collection of Wolverhampton Art Gallery, there is a pen and ink drawing, A Blind Musician, which gives some additional idea of quality and versatility of Barney's works.  Biography  =Early years= Wolverhampton archival materials and other local documents identify Joseph Barney as a son of Joseph Barney Snr., a local japanner, and, from 1780‚Äì1802, a partner of the Barney & Ryton, japanners.Roper, John S. Wolverhampton. A List of Trades and Occupations from the Town Rate Book 1792; Trades and professions in Wolverhampton 1802. Wolverhampton, 1969; Z5/5/5/29. Birmingham Diocese Archives. Lease for a year to invest possession, Mr B. Barney and Mr Jos. Barney His mother was Eleanor, n√©e Denholm. Being a son of a japanner, he received some artistic training and indeed started his artistic career painting flowers which were a popular decoration for japanned ware. =Studying in London= Barney came to London from Wolverhampton before or in 1774, as in that year he received from the Royal Society of Arts \\"a Silver Palette for a drawing of flowers\\". Barney indeed studied with Zucchi some time between c.1774 and 1780, as in 1777 he exhibited at the Society of Artists \\"at Mr Zucchi's, John Street, Adelphi\\". But the statement in the Dictionary of National Biography - \\"studied under the Italian decorative painter Antonio Zucchi (1726‚Äì1795) and Angelica Kauffman (1741‚Äì1807), exhibiting from their London address in 1777\\" http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/1486 must be challenged. Angelica Kauffman did not share the home with Zucchi, and lived at 16, Golden Square, chaperoned by her father. Barney must have known Angelica as a co-founder of the Academy of Art, an extremely popular and successful artist, and his mentor's future wife. He obviously was much influenced by her works, but so far, there is no documentary evidence of Barney being a pupil of Angelica Kauffman. During his lifetime, Barney exhibited more than hundred artworks at the Royal Academy and the British Institution. Their subjects demonstrate that the established description of Barney as \\"Fruit and Flower Painter\\" is inadequate. Only a small number of exhibited works are \\"flower pieces\\". The great majority of recorded Barney's works are religious, historic, literature, and genre paintings, which express his strong ambition to become a historic painter. While the Silver Palette of 1774 was given for his early flower designs, the Gold Palette was awarded to him in 1781 for his historical drawings.Wolverhampton Local Archives, DX-174/7; Wood, Henry Trueman. A History of the Royal Society of Arts. 1913. P.164 =Working for Matthew Boulton: mechanical paintings= Barney returned to Wolverhampton in about 1779, as in August 1779 he married Jane Whiston Chambers (or Chandler) at St John's chapel, Wolverhampton.Keith Jobst. The Barneys. 1835-1865. Brisbane, 1997;St Peter's Parish records, Wolverhampton. In October 1780, their first child was born. It was imperative to obtain means to support his new family. No later than in November 1779 he started to collaborate with Matthew Boulton (1728‚Äì1809) and his Soho manufactory, assisting in the production of so-called mechanical paintings.Eric Robinson and Keith R. Thompson. \\"Matthew Boulton's Mechanical Paintings.\\" The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 112, No. 809, pp. 497-507; Birmingham City Archives. MS3782, Matthew Boulton papers His duties were to touch and finish in paint images of original paintings which were mechanically reproduced on paper or canvas. He worked on paintings after Sir Joshua Reynolds, Benjamin West, Joseph Wright of Derby, Antonio Zucchi and Angelica Kauffman. All paintings associated with Joseph Barney from the Soho period, be it mechanical or original, are figurative. Many of them, like Benjamin West's and Angelica Kauffman's works, are complex many-figures compositions. Matthew Boulton and Josiah Wedgwood both possessed mechanical paintings finished by Barney. Other customers were Mrs Elizabeth Montagu (1718‚Äì1800), Sir Sampson Eardley, 1st Baron Eardley(1744‚Äì1824); possibly, Beilby Porteus, the Bishop of Chester and a well-known abolitionist (1731‚Äì1809); Lord Macclesfield and, possibly, Isaac Hawkins Browne.Birmingham City Archives. MS3782, Matthew Boulton papers =Independent artist= In 1781, Boulton was ceasing the production of mechanical paintings, thus Barney's collaboration with Soho manufactory finished. In 1784, Barney still was in the Midlands, painting his second altar piece, The Apparition of Our Lord to St Thomas, for St Peter & St Paul's Roman Catholic church, and exhibiting at the Royal Academy from Summer Hill, Birmingham. Between 1786 and 1793, he lived in London, at 29, Tottenham Street, actively exhibiting figurative and historic paintings at the Royal Academy, although The London Book Trade names him as an engraver and print-seller. His Scene in the ‚ÄòTempest, exhibited in 1788, might indicate his ambition to join the Boydell's Shakespeare Project in which his friends Benjamin West and Angelica Kauffman participated. During this time period, one of Barney's apprentices was William Armfield Hobday, (1771-1831), who later was an eminent court painter. In October 1793 he took the post of the Second Drawing Master for Figures at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and moved to Greenwich. He remained at the Academy until 1820.Cattermole F J. Records of the Royal Military Academy 1741-1892. Woolwich, 1892 Joseph Barney. The Thatcher. 1802 The role of Drawing Master for Figures obviously influenced Barney's later subjects, increasingly sentimental, but still figurative, not \\"fruit and flowers\\". They also reveal his close collaboration with Francis Wheatley (1747‚Äì1801), Charles Turner (engraver) (1774‚Äì1857), William Hamilton (painter) (1751‚Äì1801), Thomas Gaugain (1756‚Äì1812). But, on the whole, his late works are of inferior quality in comparison with his early paintings. In 1796, a reviewer of the 1796 exhibition at the Royal Academy commented on Barney's Inside of a Stable: \\"We have seen a great many better things of this sort than this is - it wants effect and truth of colouring. - Apropos, where is Morland?\\" London Packet or New Lloyd's Evening Post. 16.05.1796. Joseph Barney did not fulfil his artistic ambitions. His name is associated today with short-lived enterprise of mechanical paintings, a small number of \\"fruit and flowers\\" pieces, and cheap sentimental colour prints, if not practically forgotten. The present location of most of his large-scale historic and religious paintings is unknown. But their number and their titles which correspond to those by leading artists of that time indicate his sound presence in London artistic world of the late 18th-early 19th centuries. Barney's early altar pieces which survive in Wolverhampton, give a good idea about his strong artistic potential which was recognised and respected by his contemporaries. Reporting Barney's death in April 1832, The Staffordshire Advertiser wrote: \\"On the 13th inst., at his house, Stanhope-Terrace, Regent's Park, London, Joseph Barney, Esq. [died], aged 77. He was an eminent painter, and for more than 30 years drawing master at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.

A muscular, broad-shouldered man with a shock of dark hair and a big moustache, Alan Hurst fit the archetype of Australian fast bowler, 1970s style. Career Hurst made his first class debut in 1972‚Äì73 taking 18 wickets at 40.61. =Test debut= Hurst was talked about as a test prospect early on because of his pace. He was picked to play in the thirst test against New Zealand at the Adelaide, replacing an injured Max Walker. That season the selectors were \\"experimenting\\" heavily in anticipation of the Ashes series later in the year. According to one writer, \\"Hurst is no express. A famous Australian former selector refers to him as \\"the hearse\\" but throughout a hard Shield season he has carried the burden for Victoria and his figures have been consistently presentable.\\" In Hurst's first test he captured the wicket of the Kiwis‚Äô star bat Glenn Turner, taking 1‚Äì56 and 0‚Äì17. However he wasn't selected to make the trip across the Tasman for the return series a few weeks later, despite a request from Australian skipper Ian Chappell that he do so. Chappell considered Hurst the fastest bowler in the country with Dennis Lillee sidelined by a severe back injury. Hurst took 38 first class wickets in 1973‚Äì74 at 30.57. Hurst was unable to play the first few games of 1974‚Äì75 due to his back injury. The rise of Jeff Thomson during the Ashes series later in 1974 pushed Hurst further down the pecking order in the hunt for a baggy green cap. He took 29 wickets at 20.13 over the summer and was picked on the 1975 tour of England. =1975 Tour of England= Hurst took 21 wickets on the tour at 31.38 but did not play a test. He was kept on in the squad to play the 1975 World Cup. He had a strong season in 1975‚Äì76, taking 39 wickets at 23.38, including a spell of 4‚Äì13 in nine overs for Victoria against the touring West Indies. However he was unable to force his way into the test side past Lillee, Thomson, Max Walker and Gary Gilmour. Hurst‚Äôs next flirtation with international representation came in early 1976 when he toured South Africa with Richie Benaud‚Äôs International Wanderers team. Opening with Dennis Lillee, Hurst lost nothing by comparison as far as pace was concerned. He took 8 first class wickets at 19.50. In 1976‚Äì77 Hurst took 12 wickets at 18, missing some games in November due to a side strain. He was selected on the 1977 tour of New Zealand but did not perform particularly well, taking only three first class wickets at an average of 72.66. One innings his bowling was called \\"gloomily unpenetrative.\\" He was overlooked for selection on the 1977 Ashes; the fast bowlers who went were Thomson, Walker, Len Pascoe, Mick Malone and Geoff Dymock. =World Series Cricket= After knocking back a contract with the rebel organisation, Hurst was selected for the first test of the 1977‚Äì78 series against India. He took 0‚Äì31 and 2‚Äì50; he also scored 26 in the second innings, taking part in a 50-run last-wicket partnership with Jeff Thomson which proved crucial for Australia's victory. He kept his place in the second test but fell injured and was replaced by Sam Gannon. When Hurst recovered he was unable to force his way back into the side for the rest of the series, or on the 1978 tour of the West Indies. He took 41 first class wickets over 1977‚Äì78 at 27.24, including 8‚Äì84 against Queensland. =1978‚Äì79 summer= Hurst did play in the entire Ashes series during the summer of 1978‚Äì79. In six Tests, he grabbed 25 wickets and formed an opening partnership with debutant Rodney Hogg that rivalled Lillee-Thomson for potency. Even though Australia lost 5‚Äì1, the England players were full of praise for Hurst, whose sustained pace and stamina impressed those who had previously believed him to be physically suspect. Hurst took 4‚Äì93 and 0‚Äì17 in the first test. The second brought him 3‚Äì70 and 1‚Äì43. He took 1‚Äì24 and 1‚Äì30 in the third. In the fourth he took 5‚Äì28 and 0‚Äì43. In the fifth his figures were 3‚Äì65 and 4‚Äì97. He took 2‚Äì7 for Australia in a one-day game, helping in a rare Australian victory that summer. In the sixth he took 3‚Äì58. Hurst played two tests against Pakistan. In the first he took 3‚Äì55 and 3‚Äì115, but an Australian batting collapse saw them lose the game. In the second test he took 4‚Äì61 and 5‚Äì94. He took 65 first class wickets over that summer at 20.81. He was a crucial contributor to Victoria winning the Sheffield Shield that summer. =1979 World Cup and India Tour= Hurst was selected to go England for the second World Cup in 1979. He took 5‚Äì21 in a game against Canada. Hurst was also selected on the 1979 tour of India. After going wicketless in two Tests ‚Äì 0‚Äì51 and 0‚Äì93 ‚Äì Hurst was forced to return home due to a serious back injury. \\"It's a shame for this to happen to Alan,\\" said captain Kim Hughes. \\"He's no sloucher. I don't think he's ever come off a cricket ground in his life. He will be staying with us throughout the fourth Test.... Alan wants to help with other duties in any way he can. That's the sort of person he is... He really struggled for his rhythm and line. He just can't get around. He's very disappointed. He was hopeful he might put up with it and carry on, but it's no use now... He's lost everything. On his form against West Zone you just couldn't play him anymore. He's still got a lot of cricket left in him and he could do himself permanent damage.\\" Faced with potential incapacitation in later life if he continued to play, Hurst opted to retire from all cricket. He took 6 first class wickets on the tour at 37.33. He played again briefly for Victoria in 1980-81 but took no wickets. In first class cricket, he captured 280 wickets at 26.28 with a best performance of eight for 84. Hurst was an athletic man in the outfield who bowled with an elaborate, \\"winding\\" delivery stride that generated real pace. He was a terrible batsman, scoring 10 ducks in 20 Test innings. In the 1978‚Äì79 Ashes series, he set a record by scoring two pairs. The only truly controversial incident of his career happened in the 1979 Perth test when Alan Hurst ran out Pakistan‚Äôs number eleven batsman Sikander Bakht at the bowler's end as Bakht was backing up too far ‚Äì the fourth such instance in Test cricket. Later in the day, Australian batsman Andrew Hilditch was given out after an appeal for handled the ball and became the only non-striker to have suffered that decision. Hilditch picked up a wayward throw that had dribbled onto the pitch and handed the ball back to Sarfraz Nawaz who appealed and the umpire had to give him out. This incident was in retaliation for Hurst‚Äôs actions. The brief series was one of the most bad-tempered in history, caused in part by Pakistan‚Äôs decision to play their WSC-contracted men. Post-match career In 2004, Hurst was appointed as an ICC Test match referee and made his debut in the position during a match between Bangladesh and New Zealand at Dhaka.

The Austrian commander Antoniotto Botta Adorno tried to prevent this and send Count Serbelloni with the vanguard to attack. The Bourbon Army defended the town of Rottofreddo till their baggage train crossed the Tidone to the west, but were then overwhelmed by the Austrian mainforce. During the following attack against the main French army at Castel San Giovanni Austrian Field Marshal B√§renklau tried a flank attack in the south, but was hit by a musket ball and died shortly after.https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz1843.html#adbcontent The French and Spanish could hold their line but finally decided to retreat to Tortona. In the aftermath Piacenza surrendered to Austrian General N√°dasdy, but the following invasion of the Provence should end in failure. Nevertheless Italy was secured for the Austrians.

Sabarimala temple dedicated to Lord Ayyappa is located on the banks of the river Pamba. The river is also known as 'Dakshina Bhageerathi'. During ancient times it was called 'River Baris'. The River Pamba enriches the lands of Pathanamthitta District and the Kuttanad area of Alappuzha District and few areas of Kottayam Course The Pamba originates at Pulachimalai hill in the Peerumedu plateau in the Western Ghats at an altitude of and flows through Chittar, Vadasserikkara, Ranni, Ayroor, Cherukole, Keezhukara, Kozhencherry, Maramon, Aranmula, Arattupuzha, Edanad, Puthencavu, Chengannur, Kallissery, Pandanad, Parumala, Mannar, Kadapra, Melpadom, Thevery, Veeyapuram, Thakazhy, Pullangady, Pallathuruthy before emptying into the Vembanad Lake, while another branch flows directly via Karuvatta into Thottappally Spillway. The river enriches the Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha districts of Kerala state. Kuttanad, an important rice cultivation area in Kerala receives its irrigation water from the Pamba river. The Pamba basin is bounded on the east by the Western Ghats. The river shares its northern boundary with the Manimala River basin, while it shares the southern boundary with the Achankovil River basin. One branch of Pamba called Varattar flows from Arattupuzha/Puthenkavu and along Edanad, Othera, Thiruvanvandoor, Eramallikkara and flows into Manimala River at Kallumkal East side. Another branch of Pamba flows from Kuthiathode and joins with Manimala River at Kallumkal West side, and branches out again at Nedumpuram from Manimala River and flows along Thalavady, Edathua, Champakulam, Pullangady, Nedumudy and empties into Vembanad Lake at Kainakary. This branch links with Mainstream Pamba River at Pullangady while continuing to flow to Vembanad lake. One branch of Achankovil River joins with Pamba at Paippad/Veeyapuram, while another branch flows into Pamba again via Karichal, Cheruthana.

After traversing a distance of through Pathanamthitta and Alappuzha districts the river joins the Arabian Sea through a number of channels. The basin extends over an area of with the entire catchment area within Kerala state. The basin is bounded on the east by Western Ghats and on the west by Arabian Sea. Topography of the basin, reservoirs and command area Like all the river basins in Kerala, the Pamba basin also can be divided into three natural zones based on elevation, consisting of low land or seaboard, midland and high land. The coast for a short distance along the borders of lakes is flat, retreating from it the surface roughens up into slopes which gradually combine and swell into mountains on the east. The low land area along sea coast is generally swampy and liable to be flooded during monsoon inundation. The plains/midlands succeed low land in gentle ascents and valleys interspersed with isolated low hills. The high land on the eastern portion is broken by long spurs, dense forests, extensive ravines and tangled jungles. Towering above all their slopes are Western Ghats that form eastern boundary of the basins. Endangered state Information board near Nadappanthal, Sabarimala to keep Pamba clean Due to drought and a lack of conservation and protection by the government, the Pampa River has shrunk to a stream and is totally dry in many places. Nearby wells have also dried up. Water for farming, such as paddy fields, is scarce. Experts are calling for governmental awareness of the dire situation and the need to rein in development that is destroying the environment. The Kerala High Court has initiated steps to control the pollution of the river from the practice of some visitors to Sabarimala who throw their clothes into it. As part of the Punyam Poonkavanam project, pilgrims have been exhorted to avoid the usage of soap and oil while bathing in River Pamba. They are also requested not to throw any material, including clothes, to this holy river. At a broader level, this project aims to spread the message of cleanliness and greenness beyond Pamba and Sabarimala.http://www.technoparktoday.com/vsc-supports-sabarimala-clean-drive- punyam-poonkavanam/ Significance in Hinduism Lord Ayyappan (Sri Dharmasastha) appeared to the Pandalam Raja as a child on the banks of the Pamba River. The Pamba River has been venerated as Ganga of kerala, and devotees of Lord Ayyappan believe that immersing oneself in the Pamba is equivalent to bathing in the Holy Ganges River. Bathing in the river, believed to absolve one's sins, is a requirement before commencing the trek through the forest to the Ayyappan Temple atop Sabarimala. The river pamba flowing in kerala state has many famous temple in its banks other than the Sabarimala.Tiruvalla Sreevallabhapuram temple, Adoor Mannar Temple, Aranmula temple, Chenganoor Mahadeva temple, Thakazhy Sree Dharma Sastha Temple are most famous few among them.

Along with Ohmdenosaurus is one of the two formally described sauropods from the Toarcian of the northern hemisphere. Discovery The remains, consisting of a partial adult skeleton and associated partial juvenile skeleton found in continental detrital sediments of the Toarcian aged Azilal Formation, were described by Ronan Allain et al. in early 2004. The generic name derives from one of the localities, Tazouda, while the specific descriptor is a latinization of the Arabic term for \\"slender\\" due to the animal's small size for a sauropod. Its fossil was found alongside that of Berberosaurus and an indeterminate Large Theropod.Allain, R., Tykoski, R., Aquesbi, N., Jalil, N. E., Monbaron, M., Russell, D., & Taquet, P. (2007). An abelisauroid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from the Early Jurassic of the High Atlas Mountains, Morocco, and the radiation of ceratosaurs. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 27(3), 610-624. Description Scaled type specimen Tazoudasaurus, a small sauropod at long, is characterized by rather primitive features such as the prosauropod-like mandible with spatulate and denticle- bearing teeth, lack of a U-shaped mandibular symphysis as other more derived sauropods. Teeth wear in V-shaped marks indicates tooth occlusion, suggesting that vulcanodontids processed food orally when feeding. The frontal and the parietal are incomplete, the former being broken anteriorly and the latter posteriorly. The neck is flexible with elongate vertebrae that lack true pleurocoels while dorsal and caudal vertebrae series tend to be more rigid. T. naimi bears the most complete fossil skeleton for Early Jurassic sauropod remains found to date due to the scarcity of exposed strata of that age.Peyer, K., & Allain, R. (2010).

A sorcerer is weak in melee combat, but a master of arcane magic, generally the most powerful form of D&D; magic. Sorcerers' magical ability is innate rather than studied. Publication history =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= The sorcerer class was introduced in third edition as being separate from the wizard class, having more in common with contemporary fantasy fiction than the Vancian spell system. Sorcerers were introduced in the 3rd edition Player's Handbook, and updated in the 3.5 edition Player's Handbook. Compared to wizards, sorcerers' instinctive grasp of magic has more flexibility within the moment but less versatility overall. That is, they do not need to prepare specific spells in advance, but each sorcerer also acquires a much smaller number of spells, since they do not use spell books and cannot simply copy new spells from others' writing. Conversely, they do not worry about carrying spell books and having them stolen. Other effects of the sorcerers' intuitive approach are that they can cast more spells per day, but qualify for more powerful spells slightly more slowly than wizards. Since sorcerers can only have a limited number of spells at their arsenal, most tend to specialize in the offensive magic that an adventurer will use most. While they gain only a few non-combat spells, they have perhaps more sheer destructive force than any other character class. Their biggest strength is also their most fundamental disadvantage: sorcerers lack the versatility of wizards, who can use any information on an adventure ahead to prepare spells from a wide range of options. The flexible sorcerer, however, can still choose which of his few spells to use or re-use next based on each new thing he learns in the adventure, regardless of any predictions. Sorcerers and wizards often disagree; wizards tend to think of sorcerers as sloppy and undisciplined, while sorcerers can consider wizards obsessive and distant. Kobolds, wild elves, Chaos Gnomes (a subrace of Gnomes introduced in the Races of Stone supplement), Diaboli (an obscure race of anarchists from the Mystara Campaign setting, updated in Dragon magazine #327), and Spellscales (a humanoid draconic race from the Races of the Dragon supplement) all have Sorcerer as their favored class. =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= Sorcerers are among the classes presented in the 4th edition Player's Handbook 2, and expanded on in Arcane Power. Presented in the Player's Handbook II, the sorcerer is an arcane striker, with controller as a secondary role. Unlike other editions of the game, 4e sorcerers now have their own list of spells, rather than the same spells as the wizard. Sorcerers' attack spells generally use charisma; furthermore, many sorcerer spells benefit from high strength or dexterity. Sorcerers' sole class feature is spell source; there are several versions of spell source, one of which must be selected during character creation. Each version of spell source gives the sorcerer resistance to one damage type (which is fixed or variable depending on the version of spell source), gives the sorcerer a damage bonus based on either dexterity or strength, additionally, strength-based versions of spell source allow the sorcerer to use strength instead of dexterity or intelligence to determine AC while wearing light armor, and all versions of spell source give the sorcerer at least one additional benefit specific to that version of spell source, and many sorcerer powers have additional effects if a sorcerer has a specific version of spell source. In Player's Handbook II, two versions of spell source are presented: dragon magic and wild magic. Dragon magic refers to the belief that some sorcerers have draconic blood in their veins. Wild magic refers to a random, uncontainable magic that the sorcerer can tap into. In addition, the supplement Arcane Power introduces two more versions of spell source: storm magic and cosmic magic. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The sorcerer has been included as a character class in the 5th edition Player's Handbook with different subclasses defined by Sorcerous Origin. They are given two Sorcerous Origins to choose from: Draconic Bloodline and Wild Magic. The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide adds a third Sorcerous Origin, that of Storm Sorcery. Xanathar\`s Guide to Everything contains three Sorcerous Origins: Divine Soul, Shadow Magic and Storm Sorcery. Draconic Bloodline sorcery draws its power from a draconic magic in the character's blood, embuing the sorcerer with certain traits of that particular dragon type. Wild Magic sorcery draws its power from the chaos of wild magic giving the character unpredictable, but powerful, spell effects. Storm Sorcery, from the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide adds the power of the storm, giving sorcerers the power to control the weather. Divine Souls get their powers from a divine source and gives them healing powers. Shadow Magic comes from the Shadowfell tainting the user with the power of darkness and shadows.  Reception  Screen Rant rated the sorcerer class as the 5th most powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition. The Gamer rated the 5th edition sorcerer subclass Shadow Magic as the 6th most awesome subclass out of the 32 new character options in Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything. Gus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \\"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D; Beyond from\\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, sorcerers were second to last in player creations at 7,587 total.

Cosier's star shone very briefly following a sensational debut, when he became only the ninth Australian to post a century in his first Test. Overview The stocky, redheaded Cosier was a middle- order batsman who often attacked the bowling when a more judicious method was the order of the day. Given an extended trial at international level over four seasons, he never really established himself as a Test batsman, although he was vice-captain of Australia for a brief period. He had two major highlights at Test level ‚Äì a hundred on his Test debut at Melbourne against the West Indies in 1975‚Äì76, and a 168 against Pakistan the following season. Test bowlers were quick to exploit his technical deficiencies, in particular a very short backlift and abbreviated footwork. Cosier was all brute force with little finesse, but he did try to modify his technique somewhat during the 1978‚Äì79 Ashes series, when he was incongruously used as an opener. He could back his batting with slow medium-pacers that swung alarmingly when the conditions favoured him. On the 1977 tour of England he showed in an ODI at Edgbaston that he could have been well suited to the burgeoning genre of one- day cricket when he snared five for 18. However, Cosier's bowling was not really used in Tests and his first Test wicket did not come until his 13th match. He was also an excellent close-in fielder and secure slipper. Early Career Born and raised in Melbourne, Cosier attended University High School, where he captained the First XI and represented the Australian junior team in the West Indies.Taylor, P. \\"Uni. High Strong Again\\", The Age, 26 February 1970, p. 13. Highlights of that trip included 96 against Barbados. Cosier played club cricket for Northcote where his captain was Bill Lawry. He made his first-class debut aged 18 for Victoria during the summer of 1971‚Äì72, opening with Lawry. Early sports writers sometimes compared him to Lawry. Cosier was a different style of batsman but later said \\"Bill's influence on me was in the way he could fight out of a situation. He was incredible the way he would bat with pain and with everything running against him.\\"Beecher p 23 During that summer he also appeared for the Victorian Colts side along with such players as Rodney Hogg and Paul Hibbert. Cosier struggled with his weight throughout his career, in part due to his back trouble ‚Äì a permanent condition since birth: a vertebra is out of alignment. \\"I can't do any heavy physical work at all\\", he said in February 1977. \\"I can't run or do gym work.\\" =Move to South Australia= He relocated to South Australia to play regular first class cricket. \\"I wasn't getting many runs, and one day keeper Ray Jordon told me to get across to Adelaide\\", he later recalled. \\"I thought no more of it until Ray, now a newspaper columnist, wrote a story saying I would definitely be going to South Australia\\". This resulted in a series of offers from Adelaide clubs which prompted Cosier to move in 1974. Coming under the influence of South Australian skipper Ian Chappell, Cosier pursued his positive approach to batting and seemed to be headed for the top, although Chappell doubted his commitment to the game. Highlights of the 1974‚Äì75 summer for Cosier included 81 against Victoria. International Cricketer =1975‚Äì76 Season= Cosier had an excellent season with the bat in 1975‚Äì76. He leapt into test consideration with 130 for South Australia against the touring West Indians. He followed this up with 76 against NSW, and a match winning 49 against Queensland. He was named in a 13-person Australian squad to play a one-day international against the West Indies. Cosier pressed his claims with 71 and 49 against Victoriaon although he injured his hamstring in the second innings at had to bat with a runner. Cosier made his international debut for Australia against the West Indies in a one-day game. He took 1-33 and scored 25 not out, helping guide Australia to a five wicket victory. He was duly selected in the test team for the third test, replacing Terry Jenner. Cosier celebrated this by promptly scoring another century for South Australia against the West Indians, 107. =Test Debut= Cosier scored a century on debut.http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63152.html Cosier later recalled: > I remember going out to bat at 5pm and Andy Roberts had just taken the > second new ball. I had a really close lbw decision when I had scored about > five. I knew I'd hit it but I didn't know that Robin Bailhache, the umpire, > knew that I hit it. But thankfully he gave me not out. I went into lunch the > next day at 99 not out and I was so happy to get a century with my parents > and friends watching. He followed this in the next test with a knock of 28 (taking part in a 99 run partnership with Greg Chappell). \\"I value that 28 with Greg just as high as either of my test hundreds\\", said Cosier. \\"That sort of innings means something to the team. And to me.\\"Beecher p 50 Cosier was taken to hospital after crashing into a boundary and knocking his head while fielding during South Australia's Gilette Cup semi-final loss to Queensland. He managed to recover and scored 94 and took 4-95 in a state game against Victoria. Against the West Indies for Australia in the fifth test he then scored 37 in the first innings. He injured his back during the game and did not bat in the second innings and was ruled out of the sixth test. Rick McCosker took his place. He recovered to help South Australia win the Sheffield Shield that year. =1976‚Äì77 vs Pakistan= Cosier made a slow start to the 1976‚Äì77 summer, and was lucky to keep his place in the test side against Pakistan. He also captained South Australia in a number of games. \\"I loved it\\", said Cosier. \\"People said it affected my batting but that's crap.\\"Beecher p 24 Cosier said his innings of 42 against a Queensland attack led by Jeff Thomson was his best ever for South Australia. In the first test he made 33 in the first innings and was not out for 25 in the second, when he and Rod Marsh famously refused to go for a victory. Cosier later said \\"there's no way that I have had any second thoughts about the way Rod or I batted in Adelaide... I loved it.\\" Cosier was much criticised, including by Ian Chappell in an article in Cricketer magazine in January 1977 which stated: > I must confess I've still yet to be convinced that Cose is ready for test > cricket. Last summer he earned his test place, and confirmed it with his > century in Melbourne. But since then a question mark has arisen over his > dedication to cricket, and also over his ability to play on wickets which > are doing a bit. And he is definitely suspect outside his off stump. I'd > like to see Gary work harder at his game. He appears to be overweight and I > wonder how hard he is prepared to work at his batting at this stage. Cosier responded with a first innings 168 in the second test, crucial to helping set up an Australian victory. Cosier said Chappell's article \\"was really the thing that spurred me on to prove him wrong. That article got me a century.\\" In the third test he top scored in Australia's first innings with 50 but only scored 4 in the second as Australia fell to a defeat. In a February 1977 interview, Cosier admitted \\"I've got doubts about my own ability. I'm not convinced I\\"m a test batsman yet. I've got a long way to go... At the moment I'm playing one good innings and then three bad ones. I don't know why. Maybe I need to relax myself more of perhaps it's got something to do with attitude. All I know is I'm trying to work on it... I've heard about the things they say about me outside the off stump and to an extent I go along with them... I admit I'm a bit overweight.\\"Beecher p 22-23 =Tour of New Zealand= Cosier did not have a particularly memorable tour of New Zealand. In the first test he scored 23 and 2. In the second he made 21. However he did scored 93 off 92 balls against Northern Districts in a tour game. =Centenary Test= Cosier kept his place for the Centenary Test. He scored 10 and 4. Cosier was also selected on the 1977 Ashes. During the game Cosier noticed Austin Robertson handing out brown envelopes to players. Cosier later recalled: > I was told he was handing out a few theatre tickets and I didn't suspect > anything because he always looked after the boys.

Things got worse when it was revealed most of the Australian squad had signed to play World Series Cricket. Only four had not been invited: Cosier, Geoff Dymock, Kim Hughes and Craig Serjeant. Cosier: > It was incredible really. In 1977, I flew over to England with the players > and that was the flight on which Rodney Marsh broke the world beer drinking > record. Three-quarters of the players on that flight had signed these > sensational Packer contracts and they were all as drunk as you could > imagine. But the secret still didn't get out. I sat beside Hookesy on the > flight over and I had been best man at his wedding and not even he breathed > a word of it to me... [After I found out] I went up and talked to Hookesy he > said: \\"Sorry mate, I didn't know whether you had signed or not.\\" Hookesy > said he had wanted to tell me, but he just couldn't. Cosier said the revelations greatly affected the tour: > All of a sudden we had two Australian teams on one tour... I certainly felt > excluded... At one stage in England I was waiting in a bar for my teammates > to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they > never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out.

There were times when we were there to play for > Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There > were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than > what they should have been. Cosier played in the second ODI, taking 5-18 with his medium pacers, but an Australian collapse meant they lost the game. Cosier did not play a test match on the tour, with David Hookes, Richie Robinson, Craig Serjeant and Kim Hughes all being preferred to him. Cosier: > I didn't play that well in stages of the tour and other players deserved a > game. But we got to halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell > came to me and said there was trouble at the top of the order and asked if I > would like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was > quite successful. I think at the end of the tour I finished about fifth in > the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the > only one who didn't play a Test match. Cosier's highlights for the tour were 56 against Glamorgan, 56 against Warwickshire, and 100 against Nottinghamshire. World Series Cricket =1977‚Äì78 vs India= The World Series Cricket defections meant that Cosier was one of the few players left in Australian first class cricket with recent test experience. He received a lucrative offer to play for Queensland and moved to Brisbane at the beginning of the summer. A score of 55 runs off 50 balls against West Australia and 62 against South Australia helped ensure his selection for the first test. For the first test, Cosier was made opener, and scored 19 and 0. An injury meant he missed the second test, but he was back for the third, making 67 and 34, but being unable to prevent an Australian defeat. In the fourth test he made 17 and 68. For the fifth test Cosier was put down the order and scored 1 and 34. He also took some crucial catches to help Australia win. Cosier: > To be honest, I wasn't very smart about things. At that stage I was still > averaging 40 after nine Tests or so and with the Packer players away, most > of the other guys in the Aussie Test team were very new to the team. I > thought it was up to me to compete with the Packer boys.

I > probably played more aggressively than I should have. My feeling was I > wanted to give the crowd something to look at when they came in the gates. I > should have been more circumspect. In a lot of cases I was happy to get out > for 30 or 40. But I felt we needed to compete with WSC boys. =1977‚Äì78 Tour of the West Indies= Cosier began the West Indies tour well. He scored 84 off 78 balls in the first one-day game. In the first test he made a courageous 46 in Australia's first innings of 90. In the second test he failed twice, making 1 and 8. But he scored 114 against Guyana in a tour game. The third test saw Cosier score 9 and 0. He broke a thumb against Windward Islands, could not bat in the second innings and did not play another game on tour. =1978‚Äì79 Ashes= Cosier began the next summer well with 94 against Victoria. He was picked for the first test against England, made vice captain to Graham Yallop. During the match it was announced he had signed a 10-year contract with a sporting ground developer worth $50,000 a year. Playing as opener again he made 1 and 0. The second test he was put down the order and made 4 and 47; the latter was Australia's second highest score of that innings but by then Cosier had been dropped for Allan Border. =One Day Achievements= Cosier was kept on for the one day series that summer. He scored a lusty late innings 28 off 14 balls which helped Australia win the 4th IDO. He then took 3-22 in the next game and scored 8 not out, another Australian victory. =1979 World Cup= Cosier was selected in the Australia squad for the 1979 World Cup. Against England he scored 6 and took 0-24. Against Pakistan he took 3-54 and made a duck. Against Canada ‚Äì the sole Australian victory ‚Äì Cosier took 2-17. He was overlooked for the tour of India.ion Later Career =1979‚Äì80= The readmission of WSC players in 1979‚Äì80 curtailed his opportunities at state level. He said, \\"I guess though you could honestly say the relationship between Greg (Chappell) and myself, when he came back from World Series Cricket, and all of a sudden I was playing in Queensland with him, was difficult for a little while.\\" Cosier started the season well, at one stage averaging 71, but his form tapered off. He eventually returned to his native Melbourne where his first class career ended with two outings for Victoria in 1980‚Äì81. Cosier: > There are quite a few players like me who did really well early in their > careers, but didn't consolidate later on. I guess it is like climbing the > highest peak on your first climb ‚Äì where do you go from there, where is the > next peak? Players these days have a great support network around them to > guide them through that sort of stuff. Post-playing career For a number of years Cosier worked in indoor cricket. In the late 1980s he was a Victorian coach and selector. He lived in Tangier for three years and managed Abdur Rahman Bukhatir's cricket and golf interests. The North African nation boasts an eight-team national league, and proudly claims an indigenous-participation rate of 95%, and Cosier managed the national team, which is an ICC affiliate member. He returned to Australia and went into coaching and sports management.

It is classified in Thyreophora, the armoured dinosaurs; its closest relatives may have been Emausaurus and Scelidosaurus, another armored dinosaur which was mainly a quadrupedal dinosaur, unlike bipedal Scutellosaurus. It is one of the earliest representatives of the armored dinosaurs and the basalmost form discovered to date. Scutellosaurus was a small, lightly-built, ground-dwelling, herbivore, that could grow up to an estimated long. Etymology Restoration. The genus name Scutellosaurus means \\"little-shielded lizard\\", and is derived from the Latin word \\"scutellum\\" meaning \\"little shield\\", and the Greek word \\"sauros\\" (œÉŒ±œçœÅŒ±) meaning \\"lizard\\". The type and only valid species known today is Scutellosaurus lawleri. The specific name honors David Lawler who collected the fossil. Description Scutellosaurus was lightly built, and was probably capable of walking on its hind legs. It had an unusually long tail, possibly to provide a counterbalance against the weight of the armored body. It was around long, tall at the hips, and weighed . The fossil evidence includes several partial skeletons recovered from Arizona by the Museum of Northern Arizona and the University of California Museum of Paleontology, although the skull is poorly known from these specimens. There were several hundred osteoderms running along its neck to its back and as far down as its tail. These formed parallel rows, with as many as five rows on each side. It also had double rows of osteoderms, or external plates, running neck to tail. Some of these shields were flat, while others were pitted. Discovery and occurrence Coelophysis kayentakatae feeding on a Scutellosaurus. The holotype specimen of Scutellosaurus lawleri (MNA V175) was recovered at the West Moenkopi Plateau locality in the Silty Facies Member of the Kayenta Formation, in Coconino County, Arizona on the land of the Navajo Nation. The specimen was discovered and collected by David Lawler in red claystone sediments that were deposited during the Sinemurian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 196 million years ago. Skeletal reconstruction showing known material The holotype specimen was described by Edwin Colbert based on the following: partially preserved premaxillae with teeth, a right maxilla with seven teeth, a left maxilla with five teeth, dentaries that are missing their posterior portions, a left dentary with 18 teeth, a right dentary with 10 teeth, other skull fragments, 21 presacral vertebral centra, several complete and partial neural arches and spines, five sacral vertebrae, 58 caudal vertebrae with neural arches and several chevrons, several incomplete ribs, both scapulae, both coracoids, partially preserved ilia, fragments of the pubic bones and of the ischia, both humeri, the distal end of the right radius, the proximal and distal ends of the left radius and ulna, fragments of the manus, both femora, the right tibia, the proximal end of the right fibula, the right astragalus, the left tibia, the left fibula, various bones of the pedes, including a possible distal tarsal bone, and over 300 osteoderms.

He was baptised in 1559. Barnham along with his elder brother Martin (baptised 1548, died 1610) was educated at St. Alban's Hall, Oxford, but left apparently without a degree. Barnham became a liveryman of the Drapers' Company. He was elected Member of Parliament for Minehead in 1589. On 14 October 1591 he was chosen alderman of Bread Street ward (a position he held for the rest of his life). In the same year he was third warden of the Drapers' Company, but surrendered this post on election as sheriff for the year 1591 and 1592 (At 32 he was considered young to be sheriff but thirteen men more senior than he had declined to serve owing to the financial demands of the office). He served two terms as Master of the Drapers' Company in 1592‚Äì1593 and 1596‚Äì1597. In 1597 he sat in Parliament for the second time, this time representing Yarmouth, Isle of Wight. Barnham was a member of the Elizabethan College of Antiquaries. He died 3 April 1598, aged 39, and an elaborate monument was erected above his grave in St Clement Eastcheap. cites John Stow's London (ed. Strype), ii. 183. Barnham was acquiring estates by 1575 and by his death he held property in London, and land in Essex, Hampshire and Kent valued at ¬£20,100. The chief beneficiaries were his wife and daughters, but Wood tells that he left ¬£200 to St. Alban's Hall, Oxford, to rebuild \\"its front next the street\\", and that \\"as a testimony of the benefaction his arms were engraved over the gateway and on the plate belonging to the house\\". Family Barnham married Dorothy (died 1639), daughter of Ambrose Smith of Cheapside (the silkman to Queen Elizabeth), at St Clement Eastcheap on 28 April 1583. They had eight children. Three girls and a boy died in infancy. The remaining four girls lived to marry: Elizabeth the eldest married Mervyn Tuchet, 2nd Earl of Castlehaven, Alice married Sir Francis Bacon in 1606, and Bridget married Sir William Soame of Thurlow, Suffolk. Dorothy survived her husband, and became, a year or two after his death, the wife of Sir John Pakington.

Although a wicketkeeper batsman in state cricket, Robinson's three Tests were as a specialist batsman. Robinson captained Victoria and played World Series Cricket, notably keeping wicket for the Cavaliers on the Cavalier Country Tour in 1978/79 playing 17 matches, scoring 315 runs at 22.50, with 31 catches and 8 stumpings.

Career =First Class Debut= Serjeant made his first class debut in 1976‚Äì77 for Western Australia. He enjoyed a successful season, scoring 730 runs at an average of 66.36, including 89 against New South Wales, 82 against Pakistan, 54 against Victoria, 140 against Queensland and 101 against the touring MCC. This run of strong scores, particularly against two touring sides, saw him selected in the Australian squad for the 1977 Ashes. He was one of a number of young batsmen in the squad, others including Kim Hughes and David Hookes. Australia only took two specialist openers, Rick McCosker and Ian Davis, and it was thought Serjeant could be a back up. =1977 Ashes= Australia's batting line up in the Test immediately prior to the tour had been Rick McCosker, Ian Davis, Gary Cosier, Greg Chappell, David Hookes and Doug Walters. Poor early tour form from Cosier and Davis saw opportunities open up in the Test team for Sergeant, who was one of the better performing batsmen, with scores of 65 at Arundel, 55 against Kent and Surrey, 50 against Somerset and 59 against Essex. Many of these runs were scored with Sergeant opening. Serjeant expressed a desire to bat down the order but Greg Chappell said \\"he has no say in the matter\\". Australia's Test preparations were thrown by the news of the World Series Cricket plans. Serjeant was one of only four players in the Australian squad who had not signed. Serjeant was picked to play in two of the One-Day Internationals. Test Debut Serjeant was selected to play in the first Test at Lord's, batting at four (Richie Robinson was picked to open.) Serjeant top scored in Australia's first innings with 81 but failed in the second in a match that ended in a draw.1st test England v Australia Played at Lord's, London 16,17,18,20,21 June 1977 Serjeant's good form continued with 159 against Nottinghamshire, in one of Australia's few victories on the tour and 55 against Yorkshire. He revealed he had been offered a place in World Series Cricket but declined. Serjeant failed twice in the second Test then endured a run of poor form in the tour games. He was overlooked for the third and fourth Tests. During the tour Serjeant received an offer to play in Queensland but turned it down. Serjeant was recalled to the team for the fifth Test, where he replaced Ian Davis as opener. He scored a duck. =1977‚Äì78 vs India= Although Serjeant was not one of the initial players offered a contract to play World Series Cricket, his success in England saw an attempt to recruit him. Serjeant turned down the offer as he wanted to play establishment cricket. Serjeant enjoyed good domestic form at the beginning of the 1977‚Äì78 summer, scoring 129 against New South Wales, 140 against Queensland and 63 against South Australia. He was not only selected in Australia's team for the first Test, but also appointed vice captain under Bob Simpson. He scored a pair in the first Test failed twice against India for WA, then failed twice again in the second Test. Serjeant managed to keep his position for the next two Tests. In the third he made 85, which he later described as his best innings. However he failed in the second innings, and in both digs in the 4th Test. He was dropped for the final Test of the series, but was kept on for the tour to the West Indies. =1977‚Äì78 West Indies Tour= In the West Indies Serjeant scored 63 in his first tour game but a duck in the second. This meant he was initially not picked in the first Test team but a last minute illness to Rick Darling saw him open ‚Äì he scored 3 and 40. Serjeant then made 114 against Barbados but failed twice in the second test. Serjeant kept his place in the third Test. He made a duck in the first innings but scored 124 in the second, helping lead Australia to a famous victory.The Frank Worrell Trophy ‚Äì 3rd Test West Indies v Australia Played at Bourda, Georgetown, Guyana 31 March, 1,2,4,5 April 1978 In the fourth Test Serjeant made 49 and 4 then 26 and 32 not out in the fifth. =Later career= Serjeant struggled early during the 1978‚Äì79 season and was unable to regain his place in the Australian team. However, he performed solidly for Western Australia for the next few seasons.Craig Serjeant season by season first class totals He was appointed vice captain at the beginning of the 1981‚Äì82 season. Post-cricket career Serjeant graduated from Curtin University with a degree in science in 1972 and worked as a chemist at SCGH for 12 years. He then became a financial planner, working under former Australian bowler Sam Gannon from 1988 onwards.

Valero was the first to recognise and describe the outbreak of Bubonic Plague in Palestine (\\"Streptomycin in Bubonic Plague\\", British Medical Journal, 29 May 1948, pp. 1026‚Äì1027). A year later, he observed the outbreak of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Palestine (Harefuah, Vol. XXXVI, No 9,36, pp. 1‚Äì3, 1 May 1949). In his 1953 publication he presented the first reported case of human Ornithosis in the Middle East (\\"Human Ornithosis in Israel\\", Harefuah, Vol XLV, No. 5, 1 September 1953). In the 1960s, Valero recognised the potential for synergy between the clinical medical staff at Rambam Hospital and engineers at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. Valero organised teams from the two institutions, which he headed up. This unique co-operation led to the first product of the soon to be established Biomedical Engineering Department of The Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology. It was an electronic device capable of recording arterial pulsations and the mechanical events of the heart without actually making contact with the chest wall. This device was first described in the American Journal of Cardiology, 19 February 1967, Vol. 19, pp. 224‚Äì230 and in subsequent publications (list below). His first medical book Clinical E.C.G. was published in 1973 by the Technion Michlol publishing house, and his second book, Bedside Detection, was published in 1980. Valero attended Gymnasia Ivrit in Jerusalem and received an M.B. Ch.B degree from Birmingham University in England in 1938. Upon returning to Jerusalem in 1939, he volunteered to work at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. In 1941‚Äì1946, during World War II, he volunteered to join the British Army's Royal Army Medical Corps as a physician, where he reached the rank of Major. In 1946, he joined the staff of the British Government Hospital, Haifa which later became Rambam Hospital, of which he was a founder. In 1948‚Äì1949, during the Israeli War of Independence he served as a regiment physician on Israel's Northern Front. In 1950, he became Head of the Department of Internal Medicine at Rambam Hospital. In 1956, he became Director of the Israeli Government's Poriya Hospital. In 1972, he was elected a tenured Professor of the Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine of the Technion in Haifa. In 1980, he became the Dean of Medical Education of the Faculty of Medicine at the Technion. In 1980‚Äì1986, he also served as Head of the Department of Internal Medicine at Nahariya Hospital in Nahariya. In 2002, The Professor Aaron Valero Fund for the Advancement of Medical Education was established and endowed by the Valero Family in memory of Dr. Valero. The Fund enables guest speakers from Israel and abroad to give workshops, training sessions and to participate in the Professor Aaron Valero Patient ‚Äì Physician Relationship Day at the Technion.

He is commonly called Yuri Isageum.  Name  As a descendant of Silla's founder Hyeokgeose, his surname was Park. His title was Isageum, also recorded as Ijilgeum or Chijilgeum. This title is a change from Geoseogan (the first king Hyeokgeose) and Chachaung (second king Namhae). The actual Silla word is thought to be Itgeum . Imgeum is the modern Korean word for \\"King\\".  Background  Yuri was the son of Silla's second ruler, Namhae, and his queen Lady Unje. It is unclear how many siblings Namhae had, but he did have a sister. This sister, Princess Ani, was married to a non-Sillan man named Seok Talhae, who originated from an island nation called Tapana. Talhae became a very highly ranked official and Namhae seemed to prefer him as successor instead of his son. This is revealed on Namhae's deathbed, but Talhae insisted that the prince's rise to the throne would be righteous and allowed Yuri to become the next ruler of Silla.  Reign  According to the Samguk Sagi, the principal source for events of this period, Yuri centralized rule over the aristocracy by turning the six tribes into six official administrative divisions of Silla. He is said to have granted surnames to each of the clans: Yi, Choe, Son, Jeong, Bae, and Seol. He is also said to have created 17 bureaucratic rank levels. However, modern scholars doubt that these occurred so early in Silla's development. Silla was attacked by Lelang commandery and other tribes, but made peace with Maekguk (probably Dongye, present-day Chuncheon). The Samguk Sagi records that Silla conquered Iseoguk (present-day Cheongdo), but this appears to be a mistaken recording of an Yurye-era event. During Yuri's reign, the Silla people celebrated a holiday during the 15th day of the 8th month, where two teams of women would compete in a contest. The losers of the contest would have to prepare songpyeon, rice cakes, meats, fruits, and other food, shared by everyone in a feast. This is said to have been the origin of the modern Korean holiday Chuseok. Also during Yuri Isageum's reign was the rise of the Gaya confederacy as a military power in the region. Silla was under constant rivalry with Baekje already, but Gaya in the middle was even more of a direct threat.  Succession  Yuri Isageum had two sons, but his dying words were to make his brother-in-law, Seok Talhae, his successor to the throne. Yuri Isageum died in 57 AD after 34 years of reign.

A rogue is a versatile character, capable of sneaky combat and nimble tricks. The rogue is stealthy and dexterous, and in early editions was the only official base class from the Player's Handbook capable of finding and disarming traps and picking locks. The rogue also has the ability to \\"sneak attack\\" (\\"backstab\\" in previous editions) enemies who are caught off-guard or taken by surprise, inflicting extra damage. Publication history =Creative origins= The abilities of the thief class were drawn from various archetypes from history and myth, but clear debts from modern fantasy literature can be traced to characters such as J.R.R. Tolkien's Bilbo Baggins, Fritz Leiber's The Gray Mouser, and Jack Vance's Cugel the Clever. In his article \\"Jack Vance and the D&D; Game\\", Gary Gygax stresses the influence that Vance's Cugel and also Zelazny's Shadowjack had on the thief class.\\"Using a blend of ‚ÄúCugel the Clever‚Äù and Roger Zelazny‚Äôs ‚ÄúShadowjack‚Äù for a benchmark, this archetype character class became what it was in original AD&D.;\\" =Dungeons & Dragons= D&D; fan Gary Switzer shared the idea for a thief class with Gary Gygax over the phone; development was done in Switzer's roleplaying group, primarily by D. Daniel Wagner, one of the writers of The Manual of Aurania, the first non-TSR D&D; supplement. The thief class was introduced in the original 1975 Greyhawk supplement. They had 4-sided hit dice under the new combat system introduced in that supplement. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition= The thief was one of the standard character classes available in the original Player's Handbook. The thief was presented as one of the five core classes in the original Players Handbook. In 1st edition the thief was the only character class that any nonhuman type, such as an elf, dwarf, or halfling, could achieve unlimited levels in. The thief's hit dice improved to a d6. In 1st edition, thieves were swiftest to earn new levels. At the same time, thieves were sharply limited by having their essential skills (such as Open Locks and Move Silently) defined as beginning at a flat chance of success of perhaps 10-20% regardless of most circumstances, and requiring perhaps ten levels to reach the point where they had much confidence in using them. =Basic Dungeons & Dragons= Thieves were available as a character class in the game's \\"Basic\\" edition. In the later (Moldvay and Mentzer) editions of the Basic Set, they could be any of the three available alignment options (Lawful, Neutral and Chaotic). Thieves had to be Human, as this edition treated non- human races as distinct classes.Part 1 of an extended review of the Holmes Basic Set They retained the same abilities (with the same high failure rates at low levels) as in the Original and Advanced games, and at higher levels gained additional abilities, such as the ability to read any nonmagical writing (including dead languages and secret codes) and casting magic-user spells from scrolls, both with a high success rate. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition= The thief, as part of the \\"rogue\\" group, was one of the standard character classes available in the second edition Player's Handbook. According to the second edition Player's Handbook, many famous folk heroes have been larcenous like the thief class, including Reynard the Fox, Robin Goodfellow, and Ali Baba. In 2nd edition the term \\"Rogue\\" first appeared, used to describe the group of classes made up of those individuals \\"living by their wits day to day-often at the expense of others.\\" In the core rules, these \\"rogue\\" classes were the thief and the bard. Thieves could be of any alignment other than lawful good while bards had to be at least partially neutral. The thief was the robber, the thug, or the \\"expert treasure hunter\\". They specialized in the acquisition of goods, stealth, and disarming traps. Unlike in 1st edition, 2nd edition allows thieves to specialize in skills so that they needed only a few levels to master two skills. The assassin class, a sub- class of the thief in first edition, was excluded from the second edition core rules. The assumption was that an assassin could be treated mechanically as a normal thief who simply specialized in assassination-related skills. The thief class is further detailed in The Complete Thief's Handbook. =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= The thief became known as the rogue in 3rd edition. Spies, scouts, detectives, pirates, and sundry ne'er-do-wells, as well as thieves and just about any other character who relies on stealth or a broad range of skills, are stated to fall under the rogue class. In fact, the character class still bears only three large divergences from other character classes, namely their superior aptitude for skills, their capacity to notice traps, and their signature \\"sneak attack\\" maneuver. The rogue class is given 8 skill points per level, higher than any other character class. However, the number of skill points is modified by the Intelligence attribute, so it is possible for a very low intellect rogue to be no better off than a particularly bright fighter, although they would still have a broader range of skills to choose from. Also, 3rd edition skills removed the flat percentage rolls that previous thieves had used, using their Difficulty Class mechanic to let a rogue have a better chance against the cheap locks and ordinary guards that might appear in lower-level games. Modifying the skills system, rogues are normally the only class allowed to search for most traps; nobody else has the training to recognize them. However supplements to core D&D; have added a few new classes that can also recognize traps, such as the scout. The rogue has the ability to deliver a sneak attack whenever an opponent loses its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (i.e., when the opponent is flat-footed or flanked or cannot see the rogue). The rogue can then take advantage of this momentary weakness to strike at a vital part of the anatomy (provided the creature has a discernible enough anatomy to suffer a critical hit). This ability was formerly a \\"backstab,\\" which made it difficult to define when it might be applied in open combat. Allowing flanking (attacking while a teammate is on the opposite side of the target to create a sneak attack) makes the rogue deal a great amount of damage. The Iconic rogue is Lidda, a halfling female. =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= Fourth edition Rogues are skirmishers, focused on getting to where the enemy does not want them and hurting them by applying extra \\"sneak attack\\" damage to enemies that grant combat advantage to them (for instance because they are flanking the enemy or the enemy is dazed or prone). They are also highly skilled, with the most trained skills of any class in the game and all with training in stealth and thievery (a skill that includes picking locks and pockets, and disarming traps). In fourth edition rules, there are two very different mechanical conceptions of the same class; Rogues and Thieves. The Rogue was introduced in the fourth edition Player's Handbook, and initially came in two types; Artful Dodgers and Brutal Scoundrels, with Artful Dodgers being able to slip past or flank enemies easily (gaining their charisma bonus to defend against opportunity attacks) and Brutal Scoundrels adding their strength bonus to sneak attack damage to hit even further. Player's Handbook Rogues focus on their Exploits ‚Äì codified tricks they can use either at will, once per encounter, or once per day and that show how they move and how they attack. Martial Power added the Ruthless Ruffian who can use maces easily and focuses on intimidating people as well as hurting them, and Martial Power 2 added the Cunning Sneak who can hide in shadows where no one else can and therefore normally specialises in ranged attacks, and added in the option to choose as their weapon talent the crossbow. The Thief was added in Heroes of the Fallen Lands and uses a very different approach to roguish skirmishing; instead of representing the Rogue's more cinematic abilities with encounter and daily exploits it does so with \\"tricks\\" that the rogue uses as they move, with, for example, Tactical Trick allowing them combat advantage against any enemy adjacent to one of your allies and Sneak's Trick allowing the thief to hide as easily as a Cunning Sneak rogue can in order to more easily ambush enemies. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The rogue is included as one of the standard character classes in the 5th edition Player's Handbook. Players may choose from three different Roguish Archetypes at third level: Thief, Assassin, and Arcane Trickster. The Thief archetype focuses on rogues who steal, giving bonuses for sleight of hand, climbing and sneaking. The Assassin archetype deals with rogues who kill for a living, allowing them to dispatch targets swiftly and create poisons and false identities. The Arcane Trickster archetype opens up limited magic to rogues allowing them to cast spells. Later supplements introduced additional subclasses. The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide supplement adds Mastermind and Swashbuckler to the list of Rogue archetypes. The Mastermind becomes an expert in leadership, and deception, while the Swashbuckler focuses upon swordplay and rakish taunting. Xanathar's Guide to Everything reprinted both these earlier subclasses and added the Inquisitive, which focuses on detective work and investigation, and the Scout, which focuses on swiftness and a few survival skills. The Rogue's focal point in 5th edition is its aptitude for skill checks. It gains proficiency in more skills than any other class, and three of the features it gains through levels serve to improve the skills' respective ability checks. Its core features include sneak attack, which rewards a player for gaining advantage on an attack roll, such as by sneaking up on a foe unseen or incapacitating it.  Reception  Screen Rant rated the rogue class as the 6th most powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition. The Gamer rated the 5th edition rogue subclass Swashbuckler as the 3rd most awesome subclass out of the 32 new character options in Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything. Gus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \\"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D; Beyond from\\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, rogues were second most created at 11,307 total. Human (2,542) was the most common racial combination followed by elf (2,257) and then halfling (1,797).  References   Bibliography  Cook, Monte; Tweet, Jonathan & Williams, Skip.

Leonetti and starring Eric Lively, Erica Durance, Dustin Milligan and Gina Holden. The film is largely unrelated to the 2004 film The Butterfly Effect and was released direct-to-DVD on October 10, 2006. It is followed by The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations (2009). The film received generally negative reviews, with reviewers criticizing its formulaic copy of the first film, simply with different characters. Plot Nick and his girlfriend, Julie, are celebrating Julie's 24th birthday with their friends Trevor and Amanda. Julie and Nick start to discuss their future when Nick is called in to work, urgently. He has to go to the meeting because he is up against co-worker Dave for a promotion. As the four friends drive back to the city there's an accident with a semi-truck. Of the four friends, Nick is the only survivor. Later, when looking at a photograph of himself and Julie, everything in the room begins to shudder and shake, while the people in the photograph begin moving. One year later, Nick suffers a blinding headache and nosebleed at work, while presenting an important sales pitch to investors. As a result, he is given a week's suspension. Back home, Nick looks at photographs from Julie's birthday and somehow manages to transport himself back to the moment just before the fatal accident. This time, he knows how to avoid the accident and he awakens in a new timeline where Julie is living happily with him. However, in this reality, Nick's life is ruined when he is fired for backing up his friend and now colleague Trevor. Later, Nick sees a Christmas photograph of him, his friends and colleagues, and realizes that this was the point at which a crucial deal was made, resulting in Dave's promotion. Nick decides to try to alter this in his favor, so he concentrates on the photo in order to trigger another episode. Sure enough, he finds himself at the party. After deliberately spilling a drink on Dave to distract him he finds the paperwork for the crucial deal. He then returns to the present in a new version of reality. In this reality, Nick is the vice- president of the company, but he and Julie have split up and he is living the bachelor lifestyle. Also, Trevor and Nick end up on the wrong side of a shady investor; the company is broke due to failed deals in this version of reality, and the investor, infuriated by a lack of results, ends up killing Trevor, who borrowed the money from him. In the course of trying to escape a similar fate, Nick runs into Julie just as one of the investor's armed henchmen tries to hit him, but hits her instead. Nick is rendered unconscious before he can go back in time once again, and sexually assaulted, but manages to kill his captor and escape. Nick confesses everything to his mother, who tells him that he can't \\"control everything\\". She says his father also tried to control things (implying in the process that his father had the same ability as Nick does), and ultimately committed suicide. Nick transports himself to the scene from the start of the movie, hoping to finally fix everything by breaking up with Julie. However, he didn't bank on how upset she would be ‚Äì and she confesses to being pregnant and speeds away in his car. Fearing a similar accident as the original, Nick speeds after her, but ends up facing an oncoming vehicle himself. He opts to save Julie rather than himself and drives off the cliff. One year later, Julie lives in New York with her son, Nick Jr., who has the same affliction as his father, since his environment becomes unstable while looking at a photograph of his parents and their friends. In a series of flickering flashbacks that run during the end credits, an unidentified man who is presumably Nick's own father is shown grappling with mental illness -presumably brought on by the progressive brain damage that the time-traveling causes to its user with each use -and eventually committing suicide. In the last of the flickering images, Nick himself is shown recovering in a hospital bed from serious injuries, but whether this is him recovering from his initial accident shown at the beginning of the movie, or him recovering from his successful effort to save Julie, is unclear. Cast Critical reception The Butterfly Effect 2 was met with negative reviews. Reviewers claim that the sequel adds nothing to the message of the first movie, covering exactly the same ground with different characters. With a limited temporal scope, the story of this movie isn't as intertwined as the first. Also, the less- impressive special effects and very short filming time combine to give the movie a much less impressive feel than the original. It received a negative reception from Reel Film Reviews, which called it \\"An abominable, pointless sequel.\\" References External links  Category:2006 direct-to-video films Category:2006 psychological thriller films Category:Alternate timeline films Category:American science fiction thriller films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Direct-to-video sequel films Category:Films about time travel Category:Films shot in Vancouver Category:New Line Cinema direct-to-video films Category:Films directed by John R.

History The party was founded on 25 December 1980, as a continuation of the Hindustani Ghadar Party - Organisation of Indian Marxist-Leninists Abroad founded in Canada in 1970. The group had established a presence in Punjab during the 1970s. Initially the group identified itself with the Naxalite movement in India, especially in Punjab. However, by the end of the 1970s the group rejected the Three Worlds Theory and sided with Albania in the Sino- Albanian split.Judge, Paramjit S. Insurrection to Agitation: The Naxalite Movement in Punjab. Bombay: Popular Prakashan, 1992. p. 145statement of cgpi 15 August 2000 Leftist Parties of India The name of the party was inspired by the American-based Ghadar Party, formed by Indian revolutionaries in the early 1900s. Ghadar means revolt, a narrative abbreviation referring to Indian Revolt. The party opposed the policies of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI(M)) at the time, which according to CGPI had both adopted a policy of parliamentarianism and support for the Soviet Union and the Naxalbari were fragmented. The party also adopted a policy of opposing 'national oppression', particularly in Punjab, Kashmir and Manipur and rejected defense of the centralised India state. In December 1990 they held their first congress where they reflected upon the collapse of the Soviet Union, declaring \\"we are our own models\\". They concluded that \\"it is the workers and peasants, women and youth, organised in their collectives, who should rule\\". They recognised the communist movement as one, and rejected social-democracy as a compromise between right reaction and revolution and rejecting support for the Indian National Congress party against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The Second Congress was held in 1999, and the Third Congress in January 2005. At the latter the Constitution of the Communist Ghadar Party of India was adopted. The Fourth Congress was held in October 2010. 25 December 2010 marked the 30th anniversary of the founding the Party. Ideology and theory The work of CGPI is based on the theoretical thinking of Marxism-Leninism and guided by contemporary Marxist-Leninist thought. Contemporary Marxist-Leninist thought is the summation, taken in general form, of the experience of the application of Marxism-Leninism to the conditions of socialist revolution and socialist construction, to the struggle against modern revisionism and against capitalist restoration, against fascism, militarism, imperialism and medievalism. It is not the final form of Marxism- Leninism under the economy, empowerment of the people and the democratic renewal of India. The principle adopted at the First Congress that \\"we are our own models\\", let us emulate the best we have created. \\"We are her masters!\\" ‚Äî the Program adopted by the Second Congress of the Communist Ghadar Party of India in October 1998 was characterised by the slogan: \\"Hum hain Iske Malik! Hum hain Hindostan! Mazdoor, Kisan, Aurat aur Jawan!\\" ‚Äî which means: \\"Workers, peasants, women and youth ‚Äî We constitute India! We are her masters!\\" CGPI, 3rd Congress document,(2005), p71 From its 3rd congress document it states: The challenge is to enable the working class to emerge as a united force that forges a powerful front with the peasants and all the oppressed. The challenge is to organise and lead this front to wrest political power from the hands of the exploiting minority and vest it in the hands of the people. The workers, peasants, women and youth of all the nations, nationalities and tribal peoples constituting India must be enabled and organised to set the agenda for the new society.CGPI, 3rd Congress document,(2005), p11 Titled: Towards the Rule of Workers and Peasants and a Voluntary Indian Union. =\\"Towards the Rule of Workers and Peasants and a Voluntary Indian Union\\"= In its research, CGPI states in its 3rd congress document:- India is seeking a place at the privileged high table, to carve up the world. The Indian big bourgeoisie, in pursuit of imperialist aims, is seeking closer collaboration with US imperialism as well as with the European Union and Russia. China is seen as a major competitor, while it could also be a potential collaborator. The Indian bourgeoisie is colluding and contending with other imperialist powers, seeking to expand its own sphere of influence in the world, especially in central and South-East Asia. Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism, stands increasingly exposed as a system that cannot prolong its life without raining death and destruction on a colossal scale. It is being exposed as a system that is unable to sustain itself without militarisation and wars of conquest, without intensifying the degree of exploitation and misery of the labouring people, and without destroying entire nations and continents. Capitalist globalisation‚Äîthrough liberalisation, privatisation and fiscal stabilisation‚Äîhas been exposed as nothing but unbridled robbery and plunder of the nations and peoples of the world in the interests of monopolies and financial oligarchs of a few big and emerging powers. \\"Within the capitalist democracies, the regimes in power are openly showing their contempt for the well-being and rights of the working class and peoples. They are openly revealing themselves as the tools of finance capital and of the biggest and most aggressive capitalist monopolies. The political process of bourgeois democracy, in its parliamentary and presidential forms, stands exposed as a process designed to concentrate political power in fewer and fewer hands, to the exclusion of the vast majority of people. More and more people are protesting this exclusion from power. They are protesting the fact that they have no say, except to vote once in a few years to legitimise the rule of one or another party or coalition of the bourgeoisie.CGPI, 3rd Congress document, (2005), p75-78 \\"The times are calling on all Indian communists to redouble their efforts to forge the political unity of the working class, peasantry, intelligentsia, oppressed nations and nationalities, tribal peoples, dalits, women and youth. Such political unity can and must be forged on the basis of uncompromising opposition to the bourgeoisie and its anti-social program; and for the realisation of the program for the Navnirman of India. This is a program for taking India out of the world imperialist system by making a clean break with the colonial legacy in economic and political terms. It is a program to establish the rule of workers and peasants, and a voluntary Indian Union, with the economy being oriented to fulfil the needs of the toilers and tillers. The Communist Ghadar Party of India, as a contingent of the international communist movement, is dedicated to adopt tactics that will pave the way for the defeat of the bourgeoisie and those who conciliate with it, and ensure the victory of the program for the Navnirman of India.\\" CGPI, 3rd Congress document, (2005), p81 =On developing theory= It pointed out the necessity for the working class to contest outmoded Eurocentric ideas as well as the reactionary bourgeois rendering of Indian thought, so as to develop the theory of the Indian revolution. It also pointed out that the seeds of revolution exist within the existing conditions of perpetual crisis and revolutionary theory must illuminate the way to nourish those seeds so as to open the path to revolution and social progress. The starting point of all theoretical work is the study of the facts and phenomena that are being revealed. Revolutionary theory must assist in analysing the class struggle within the present conditions. * ... aimed at exposing and defeating the lies, illusions and diversions that the bourgeoisie is throwing at the working class and other discontented masses of people. It must be waged against the enemy within the communist movement‚Äîthat is, those who are acting as the channels of spreading bourgeois illusions among the workers and peasants. * ... against the notion that some individual genius or expert group can develop theory and lead the ideological struggle. The struggle against this 'expert line' has been waged concretely by involving more and more comrades in the theoretical and ideological work. The Central Committee has made a conscious effort to create an enabling environment for wider and wider participation in this work. This has greatly contributed to the strengthening of the work of developing theory. In addition to enriching the line, this work has assisted in raising the ideo-political level of all members of the time-tested. * ... have brought together a large number of comrades to spend extended periods of time on concentrated research work and theoretical treatment of selected topics. * ... approach to the theoretical and ideological work, as in the case of all other time-tested work, has been to rely on the principle of collective leadership and individual responsibility. * ... waged a stern struggle in the course of carrying out the theoretical and ideological work, in defence of the scientific method and implementation of agreed upon decisions of the collective. The scientific method consists in starting from facts and analysing the problem as it presents itself today, based on studying the documents of the Party and the Marxist-Leninist classics. A constant struggle has been waged against the tendency to start writing without studying the facts or the Party‚Äôs basic documents and the classics. * ... adopted the immediate program of Navnirman (reconstruction, to build afresh, a thoroughgoing renewal), aimed at making the toilers and tillers the masters of India. * ... have further laid bare the laws of capitalism as they operate at the present stage of monopoly capitalism and imperialism. We have investigated and exposed the content of the privatisation and liberalisation program and the so-called war against terrorism. We have further elaborated the theoretical considerations underlying the Program we have adopted. All this work has contributed to developing the content of the struggle of the working class against this anti-social program.

History The dive took place in January 1992, during the filming of the National Geographic documentary Blue Wilderness, at Dyer Island, South Africa. After 8-10 large Great White sharks had been kept around their boat for about 6 hours using chum and sea mammal flesh, four scuba divers carried out the world's first dive amongst these animals without a safety cage, or any other protection, like chain-mail suits. The divers were Ron & Valerie Taylor, notable Australian film-makers and pioneers of underwater exploration, their friend George Askew, a South African diver and photographer, and Piet 'PJ' van der Walt, who had founded the South African cage-diving industry in 1988. The Taylors and Askew, recognised shark experts and authorities, were testing their hypothesis that these animals had a much fiercer reputation than they deserved. Their hypothesis was based on many years of experiences with various types of shark, including face to face encounters underwater. In 1978, Askew had written an article entitled \\"The Jaws fish - Myth or Maneater?\\", published in the UK magazine Underwater World, proposing that Great Whites did not deserve the horrific image and reputation that Jaws author Peter Benchley and film director Steven Spielberg had imprinted in peoples minds. Askew postulated that, as they rely on stealth and surprise when attacking, Great Whites would be unlikely to attack if you were aware of their presence. He had two more articles on the same subject published in 1983 and 1991, and then went on to prove that point with the historic dive in 1992. Whilst surface testing of the prototype \\"Shark POD\\" Protective Oceanic Device (now Shark Shield) for the Natal Sharks Board, the divers discovered that despite having been excited for hours previously by large amounts of blood-laden chum (mashed fish, blood and oil) and chunks of dolphin and whale meat from washed up carcasses, the sharks were actually very shy and difficult to approach, even scared of these unknown intruders. After a long 20 minute wait, the divers had several timid encounters with the very cautious sharks and were never at any time challenged, nor made to feel uneasy. This ground-breaking \\"Underwater Everest\\" conquest, a huge leap forward in ocean exploration, strongly challenged the idea of the Great White as a \\"Mindless Monster\\" eating machine, and changed the way the world viewed sharks. The Taylors felt that the Australian sharks may have a slightly different disposition to South African ones, but as it is now known that Great Whites swim between South Africa and Australia, this is open to debate. On two occasions many years before, they had released Great Whites trapped in wire ropes from cages without being harassed, despite touching the animals. Askew had encountered Great White Sharks several times previously over the years whilst spear-fishing. The first was in 1960, when meeting one was considered to mean certain death. This encounter was with a very gravid female who had come into a small cove to drop her pup/s. She was in such an advanced stage of pregnancy that her body was distorted, with her mouth actually facing forward above her hugely distended stomach. She was what is referred to as a \\"Drop- Gut\\". In the animal world a mother is usually very protective and aggressive just before and just after giving birth, and yet this large Apex Predator showed no aggression towards him. Because of this and similar encounters, and those of his colleagues, he became more interested in this question. Just before the dive, Askew and Ron Taylor were kneeling on the dive platform a few centimetres above water, with their hands in the water filming. Askew stood up and stepped back, and at that moment a four-metre Great White slid onto the platform and stopped 3 inches from his foot before sliding back, but made no attempt to snap or lunge at him. It would have taken his camera and arms, and maybe pulled him in if he had not got up. Askew sees that incident as pure opportunism and not savagery. The Prototype 'Pod\\" Valerie is seen wearing during this dive was a dummy for continuity and afforded the divers no protection. That first close encounter dive demonstrated that Great Whites are not built only to devour people but are very curious and can be quite 'friendly'. This dive is directly responsible for the upsurge in Shark Tourism ‚Äì especially free-diving (i.e. Out of cage swimming) with big sharks. When existing and potential operators around the world learnt of the theory that the Great White was quite approachable and not likely to attack, it was hypothesised that the same applied to other dangerous sharks such as tiger sharks, bull sharks and oceanic whitetip sharks. This proved to be the case and shark tourism began to expand rapidly. It is now a multibillion-dollar a year industry, and has provided a lot of useful insights into sharks. Since this dive some divers have attempted cage-less dives with big sharks, even hitching rides on their dorsal fins and touching them underwater. Another cage-less dive expedition took place October 2011 off the coast of Baja, Mexico. On this expedition divers from 4 countries dove outside the cage successfully with Great Whites. However, such attempts are not recommended as sharks are still Apex Predators and very opportunistic. Although there have never been any serious incidents from free-swimming with Great Whites, the same cannot be said for other sharks. There have been a number of fatalities and other injuries.

Other names for the plant are nodding avens, drooping avens, cure-all, water flower and Indian chocolate.A Modern Herbal. It is native to much of Europe, with the exception of Mediterranean areas, as well as some parts of Central Asia and North America. In North America, it is known as purple avens. It grows in bogs and damp meadows, and produces nodding red flowers from May to September. The plant is a native perennial of slow-draining or wet soils and can tolerate mildly acidic to calcareous conditions in full sun or under partial shade. Habitats include stream sides, pond edges, damp deciduous woodland and hay meadows.Wildseeds Website. Geum rivale is pollinated primarily by bees, less often by flies and beetles. As the flower matures, elongation of the stamens ensures it self-fertilises if not already cross- pollinated. The flowers stigmas mature before the stamens. It begins flowering a little earlier than G. urbanum, so early pollinations will be within the gene-pool of the single species. The seeds of Water Avens are burr-like, and are distributed after being caught in the coats of rabbits and other small mammals, and by rhizomal growth.

Clerics are versatile figures, both capable in combat and skilled in the use of divine magic (thaumaturgy). Clerics are powerful healers due to the large number of healing and curative magics available to them. With divinely-granted abilities over life or death, they are also able to repel or control undead creatures. Clerics also have specific 'domains' which usually align with the character's alignment and the god that cleric serves. Whether the cleric repels or controls undead is dependent on the cleric's alignment. It is the only class to be in every version of Dungeons & Dragons without a name change. Publication history =Dungeons & Dragons= The cleric character class first appeared in the original edition of Dungeons & Dragons. In the original edition, the class is described as gaining \\"some of the advantages from both of the other two classes (Fighting- Men and Magic-Users) in that they have the use of magic armor and all non- edged magic weapons (no arrows!), as well as a number of their own spells. In addition, they are able to use more of the magical items than are the Fighting-Men.\\" As is typical of the terse manner of the original rule books, little more is said about the cleric class. Since then, followers gained when creating a stronghold include \\"Turcopole\\"-type horsed crossbowmen, there is already a hint of the crusades as an inspiration, as seemingly later confirmed by Len Lakofka.\\"The AD&D; game models its cleric after the medieval fighter- cleric, √† la Templar or Hospitlar.\\" The cleric character class began as a simulation of vampire hunting clergy, such as seen in B grade \\"Hammer Horror\\" films, specifically created to oppose a vampire player character called \\"Sir Fang\\". E. Gary Gygax added the restriction on weapon types, influenced by a popular interpretation of the Bayeux Tapestry where Odo of Bayeux is depicted with a mace in hand, though this is sometimes conflated with Archbishop Turpin of Chanson de Roland fame, who actually wields both spear and a sword called \\"Almace\\". When the paladin character class was introduced in Supplement I ‚Äì Greyhawk (1975), the potential for confusion between the roles of the two classes arose. The clearest way to understand the distinction is to envision the archetypes as relating primarily to Archbishop Turpin and Roland as models. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition= The cleric was one of the standard character classes available in the original Player's Handbook. The cleric was presented as one of the five core classes. The cleric's hit dice improved to a d8, first level clerics could now cast one spell, and the wisdom score now gave clerics a spell bonus while low wisdom gave a chance of spell failure. The speciality cleric and cleric spell sphere concepts were first introduced in the Dragonlance Adventures hardcover book (1987). =Dungeons & Dragons= The cleric was available as a character class in the game's \\"Basic\\" edition. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition= The cleric, as part of the \\"priest\\" group, was one of the standard character classes available in the second edition Player's Handbook. According to the second edition Player's Handbook, the cleric class is similar to certain religious orders of knighthood of the Middle Ages such as the Teutonic Knights, the Knights Templar, and Hospitalers, which combined military and religious training with a code of protection and service. Archbishop Turpin (of The Song of Roland) is an example of such a cleric. The Complete Priest's Handbook details priestly characters and religion in campaigns. The 2nd edition cleric could optionally choose to be a priest of a specific mythoi and pick a specific religion or mythos. Within the mythos or religion chosen by the character are abilities and powers, represented by the Spheres of Influence (Combat, Creation, Healing, Necromancy, Protection, Sun, Weather, etc.) defined by the worshiped deity's dogma (Tyranny, Death, Life, Healing, etc.), power (demi, lesser, intermediate or greater power), and alignment (Lawful Good, Chaotic Evil, etc.). Further variant clerics were developed in Spells and Magic and Faith and Avatars, including the Crusader, Monk, Mystic, and Shaman. Spells The cleric's dogma determines what type of spell the cleric has access to, with greater access (all spells within a sphere, providing the cleric is of sufficient power [level] to cast it) for those spells closely aligned with the deity's dogma and minor access (spells of equal to or less than 3rd level) of those partially within the deity's dogma, while no access to those spells outside the deity's dogma. The deity's power defines the upper limit of the spells able to be granted to a cleric: a demi- god can grant up to 4th level spells and a greater deity up to 7th level spells. For example, a greater deity of Healing could grant spells of all levels in the Healing sphere, minor access to Divination spells and no access to combat spells such as Flamestrike since they are antithetical to its healing dogma. Weapons and armor Reluctant to shed blood, clerics are limited to blunt, bludgeoning weapons unless allowed other weapons by their dogma or mythos. They are trained for battle and spiritual works, so they may use any armor or shield. =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= In the 3rd Edition (and revised 3.5 Edition) of D&D; the cleric must choose either a deity or an alignment concept to be dedicated to (the \\"patron\\"). The cleric's alignment must be within 1 step of their patron (e.g., for a Lawful Good patron the cleric can be Neutral Good, Lawful Good or Lawful Neutral). Notably, it is also stated that a cleric needn't worship a specific deity or have a religion at all, but can draw their power from a philosophy or even their personal devotion to a cause or way of life. Divine spellcasting in 3rd Edition is dependent on Wisdom, which restricts the highest spell levels available to the cleric. Other useful abilities for the Cleric include Charisma, to bolster Turn/Rebuke Undead and Diplomacy checks, and Constitution, to complement their melee abilities by way of Concentration for defensive casting, and increased Hit Points.  Domains  At the beginning of their career, clerics must choose two of the powers associated with the patron (called Domains) as the focus of their particular training, faith, and dogma. These allow them to prepare Domain Spells each day from those domains' spell lists, in addition to their more general cleric spells. Each domain also has another set power associated with it. For example, the Strength domain allows its clerics to increase their strength for one round per day by a number equal to their cleric level, and the Healing domain makes clerics more adept at casting healing spells. There are many other domains like \\"animal\\" or \\"good\\".  Spontaneous casting  Clerics differ from other spellcasters in that they can use an unprepared healing spell (or harming spell, for evil aligned clerics) in lieu of another spell of the same level. For example, Good-aligned clerics can transform a prepared (non-domain) spell into a healing spell of the same level (for example, a Chaotic Good cleric can transform Protection from Evil, a first level protective spell, into Cure Light Wounds, a first level healing one). Evil aligned clerics can perform a similar feat but convert prepared spells into Inflict spells that cause similar damage. Neutral clerics must choose one type of spell conversion or the other at first level, which is subsequently permanent. This choice also affects a cleric's ability to turn (drive off or force to cower in terror) and destroy or rebuke (force to cower in awe) and command undead. * A cleric who spontaneously casts healing spells channels positive energy, and therefore turns (or destroys) undead. * A cleric who spontaneously casts inflict spells channels negative energy, and so rebukes (or commands) undead. Spontaneous casting encourages clerics to function the way adventures often require them to, as steady sources of healing (or damage), but allows them to prepare a full variety of spells in case not all that direct power is needed.  Weapons  Clerics are no longer restricted to blunt weapons. They are proficient with all simple weapons and may be proficient with other weapons depending upon chosen domains or feats; often clerics will wield their deity's signature weapon (training in this weapon is granted to the cleric by default) as a tangible symbol of their faith and dedication. Clerics may use any armor or shield (except the tower shield, which only fighters normally use). =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= The cleric's power source remains divine, and they fill the role of Leader. Their powers (called prayers) are mainly concerned with healing, protection and support; however, like most 4th edition classes, they gain the standard number of attack powers based on their level, and like all 4th edition classes, their attack powers generally include damage-dealing capabilities. Like Wizards, Clerics gain Ritual Caster as a bonus feat. The Player's Handbook presents two Cleric builds, Battle Cleric, which focuses on offense, melee combat and Strength-based prayers, and Devoted Cleric, focusing on support, ranged combat and Wisdom-based prayers, many of the cleric's Strength and Wisdom based prayers have secondary effects related to Charisma. Like paladins, clerics possess the \\"Channel Divinity\\" class feature and can use it for multiple functions, including Turn Undead and deity-specific powers. The Player's Handbook includes four Cleric paragon paths: Angelic Avenger, Divine Oracle, Radiant Servant and Warpriest (later renamed Tactical Warpriest, to avoid confusion with the Essentials variant of the same name). Dungeons & Dragons Essentials The Essentials rulebook Heroes of the Fallen Lands presented an alternate core version of the Cleric, known as the Warpriest. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The cleric has been included as a character class in the 5th edition Player's Handbook. Players choose from one of seven Divine Domains when creating a cleric character: Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, or War. The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide supplement adds the Divine Domain of Arcana to the possible options. Xanathar's Guide to Everything adds the Divine Domains of Forge and Grave. Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica adds the Divine Domain of Order. In addition to those, the Dungeon Master\`s Guide contains the Death Domain under the Villainous Class Options section. Each Divine Domain gives the cleric different default domain spells. The Knowledge domain values learning and understanding, Life values healing, Light values rebirth and renewal, Nature values protecting the natural world, Tempest values the power of the natural world, Trickery values shaking things up and being disruptive (for good or evil) and War values fighting for his or her faith. Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide adds the Arcana domain which melds the power of the gods with magic. The Forge domain from Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything focuses on creation and empowering weapons, while the Grave domain from the same supplement focuses on preserving the balance of life and destroying the undead. Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica adds the Order domain which represents discipline and devotion to society and law. The Death domain from the Dungeon Master\`s Guide is intended for evil characters and is focused on death, necromancy and the undead. Campaign settings =Dark Sun= As there are no gods in Dark Sun, Clerics derive their powers directly from the elemental planes.  Reception  Screen Rant rated the cleric class as the 3rd most powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition. The Gamer rated the 5th edition cleric subclass Grave Domain as the 5th most awesome subclass out of the 32 new character options in Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything. Gus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \\"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D; Beyond from\\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, clerics were the fifth most created at 9,009 total. Human (2,339) was the most common racial combination followed by dwarf (2,199) and then elf (921).

It held village status prior to January 1, 2015. It is located on Highway 3, 16 kilometres north of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border and 200 kilometres southwest of Winnipeg. Crystal City was established in 1947. Thomas Greenway, the community's founder, later became its provincial representative in the Manitoba Legislature and later Premier of Manitoba. The community was moved near the railway, which is no longer in use, for more attraction. Greenway named it Crystal City because he thought that one day it would become a city - but it never did. The local school is named after him: Thomas Greenway Middle School (TGMS). TGMS has grades 5‚Äì8, and the Crystal City Early Years School (CCEY) has grades K-4. The community has a rich heritage as a thriving agricultural service centre. Since the 1960s, Crystal City has had to adapt to changes brought about by the trend toward larger farms and an aging population.

LPP identifies learning as a contextual social phenomenon, achieved through participation in a community practice. According to LPP, newcomers become members of a community initially by participating in simple and low-risk tasks that are nonetheless productive and necessary and further the goals of the community. Through peripheral activities, novices become acquainted with the tasks, vocabulary, and organizing principles of the community's practitioners. Gradually, as newcomers become old timers and gain a recognized level of mastery, their participation takes forms that are more and more central to the functioning of the community. LPP suggests that membership in a community of practice is mediated by the possible forms of participation to which newcomers have access, both physically and socially. In the case of a mentor-mentee relationship between older timers and newcomers, the old timer has both the power to confer legitimacy to the newcomer, and to control the newcomer's level of access to different community practices and experiences. If newcomers can directly observe the practices of experts, they understand the broader context into which their own efforts fit. Conversely LPP suggests that newcomers who are separated from the experts have limited access to their tools and community and therefore have limited growth. As participation increases, situations arise that allow the participant to assess how well they are contributing through their efforts, thus legitimate peripheral participation provides a means for self-evaluation . LPP is not reserved for descriptions of membership in formal organizations or professions whose practices are highly defined. For example, O'Donovan and Kirk suggest that young people's participation in sport can be compared to a Community of Practice related to physical education. In his later work on communities of practice, Wenger abandoned the concept of legitimate peripheral participation and introduced the idea of a duality instead; however, the term is still widely used in relation to situated learning.

It is used to represent diagrams of digital integrated circuits. The ASM diagram is like a state diagram but more structured and, thus, easier to understand. An ASM chart is a method of describing the sequential operations of a digital system.  ASM method  The ASM method is composed of the following steps: :1. Create an algorithm, using pseudocode, to describe the desired operation of the device. :2. Convert the pseudocode into an ASM chart. :3. Design the datapath based on the ASM chart. :4. Create a detailed ASM chart based on the datapath. :5. Design the control logic based on the detailed ASM chart.  ASM chart  An ASM chart consists of an interconnection of four types of basic elements: state name, state box, condition checks, and conditional outputs. An ASM state, represented as a rectangle, corresponds to one state of a regular state diagram or finite state machine. The Moore type outputs are listed inside the box. State Name State Name: The name of the state is indicated inside the circle and the circle is placed in the top left corner or the name is placed without the circle. State box State Box: The output of the state is indicated inside the rectangle box Decision box Decision Box: A diamond indicates that the stated condition/expression is to be tested and the exit path is to be chosen accordingly. The condition expression contains one or more inputs to the FSM (Finite State Machine). An ASM condition check, indicated by a diamond with one input and two outputs (for true and false), is used to conditionally transfer between two State Boxes, to another Decision Box, or to a Conditional Output Box. The decision box contains the stated condition expression to be tested, the expression contains one or more inputs of the FSM. Conditional output box Conditional Output Box: An oval denotes the output signals that are of Mealy type. These outputs depend not only on the state but also the inputs to the FSM.  Datapath  Once the desired operation of a circuit has been described using RTL operations, the datapath components may be derived. Every unique variable that is assigned a value in the RTL program can be implemented as a register. Depending on the functional operation performed when assigning a value to a variable, the register for that variable may be implemented as a straightforward register, a shift register, a counter, or a register preceded by a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block associated with a register may implement an adder, subtracter, multiplexer, or some other type of combinational logic function.  Detailed ASM chart  Once the datapath is designed, the ASM chart is converted to a detailed ASM chart. The RTL notation is replaced by signals defined in the datapath.

Professor Randall Rhoades of Ashland, Ohio, coined a word in 1945 that became the accepted description of the study of picture postcards.Postcard Collector's Magazine: Postcard Enterprises Inc., Palm Bay, Florida, First Issue January 1976, page 15Deltiology 101, Retrieved 10 July 2011 It initially took about 20 years for the name to appear in a dictionary. Compared to philately, the identification of a postcard's place and time of production can often be an impossible task because postcards, unlike stamps, are produced in a decentralised, unregulated manner. For this reason, some collectors choose to limit their acquisitions to cards by specific artists and publishers, or by time and location. History Deltiology appeared at the end of the 19th century, when the mass production of postcards began and received international distribution as the cheapest type of postal items. The first postcard was published in 1869, and by 1875, 231.5 million open letters were sent in the member countries of the Universal Postal Union. In the late XIX- early XX centuries the first organizations of deltiologists appeared. Special magazines and catalogs began to be published (in Germany, Austria-Hungary, France, Russia, Great Britain, the United States, Italy, Switzerland, Spain, etc.), international exhibitions took place (in Leipzig, Saint Petersburg, Nice, Paris, Florence, Nuremberg, London, etc.), congresses of collectors and postcard publishers (in Leipzig - 1896, 1910; in Nice - 1899), the first auctions began to be held. Since the beginning of the 20th century deltiology has become one of the most popular types of collecting facilitated by the mass production of postcards of diverse topics (geography, ethnography, history, various types of art, technology, sports, portraits, etc.) and of high-quality art and printings, and by postal exchange between countries which expanded significantly with the strengthening of international relations. The initial views on deltiology were somewhat different from the ones we have today. At the beginning of the XX century it was believed that only a postcard that was mailed, ‚Äúfulfilled its function‚Äù, can be a worthy collectible. Moreover a postcard with a view of a city (locality) can be sent only from this city (locality). A blank postcard without a postmark was equated to a ‚Äúpicture‚Äù. Nowadays, on the contrary, a number of collectors go by the principle of ignoring the cards with writings on them. Today deltiology is one of the most popular types of collecting. Moreover, postcards are usually valued in proportion to their age and rarity of the topic. Recently, an increased demand for postcards has provoked an increase in prices. So, for example, the price of some postcards at online auctions can reach one thousand dollars, whilst most of postcards would not reach the cost of 5 dollars.Osinin A. Why do we collect postcards, or could postcards to be a good investment// Deltiology. ‚Äî 2007. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 1. ‚Äî P. 49. Identification There are some general rules to dating when a postcard was printed.Information about dating postcards Postcards are generally sent within a few years of their printing so the postmark helps date a postcard. If the card is original and not a reprint, a postcard's original printing date can be deduced from such things as the fashions worn by people in the card, the era in which the cars on the street were made, and other time-sensitive clues. Postcards produced by the Curt Teich Company can be dated more exactly if the stamp box on the reverse is visible, since the company printed a date code within the stamp box.A guide to the year published is available at Guide to dating Teich cards Picture postcards can be assigned to \\"the Golden Age of Postcards\\" (1898‚Äì1919), the time of the linens (circa 1930‚Äì1950), or to the modern chromes (after 1940). Modern chromes are color photographs and thus differ from photochromes generated from black and white photographs before 1915. Picture postcards can also be differentiated on the basis of other features: undivided backs are typical for c. 1901‚Äì1906, and divided backs for c. 1907‚Äì1915, while white border cards are common from c. 1915-1930. Practice Postcards are collected by historical societies, libraries and genealogical societies because of their importance in research such as how a city looked at a particular time in history as well as social history. Many elementary schools use postcards to teach children geography. Postcard pen pal programs have been established to help children in language arts. Deltiologists, as postcard collectors are called, collect for a variety of reasons. Some are attracted to the postcards themselves, then narrow down their interests. Others are interested in something in particular, such as ballet, then decide to collect ballet-related postcards as a way to augment their interest in ballet. Collectors may find picture postcards at home in boxes, attics, or scrapbooks, generate their own on trips and vacations, and acquire them from stores, flea markets, purchasing on the Internet, or other collectors. A number of artists have become recognized for the creation of postcards and certain publishers specialize in the production and printing of picture postcards.See subsections in Category:Postcards  Worldwide popularity  Worldwide deltiology is the third-largest collecting hobby after stamp collecting and coin/banknote collecting. Postcard clubs may be found in many countries; and these clubs, as well as related organizations, frequently host postcard shows. Online postcard clubs have also become popular. They mainly focus on providing their members with catalogs and features for tracking their collections and interacting with each other. Some websites popularize deltiology by providing opportunity to receive and send postcards to random people around the world. Collection storage There are three most popular ways to store postcards: index card, in albums and in envelopes. Until the 1990s collectors mainly used cardboard albums threading the corners of postcards in the slots. Nowadays plastic photo albums with pockets are used more often, as a postcard can be inserted in the pockets completely. The album storage method ensures the safety of the collection in the best way, plus its visually appealing. However, there are such disadvantages as the space the collection takes up, the weight of and the overall cost of all the albums one might need. With the index card storage method collections of postcards are located in boxes of the appropriate size. Such boxes can be made by the collector independently from plywood, hardboard and standard shoe boxes. The boundaries of each subsection of the collection are marked with separator cards, which have a format larger than that of the postcard. And when it comes to envelops, a collector can put different postcards in an envelope dividing them by their themes. The main advantages of these methods compared to albums are its compactness, money saving, and time saving as you do not need to spend time on inserting and rearranging cards in albums; the main disadvantage is that postcards quickly wear out from constant sorting.

Due to the harsh geographical condition of Usan-guk, people of Usan-guk believed that Silla would not invade its island. Still, Isabu decided to subjugate this island nation. However, such tough geographical condition was not the only obstacle. As Usan-guk is an island nation composed of independent tribes that rely on fishing for living, the people of Usan-guk turned out to be somewhat uncontrollable and aggressive and thus hard to conquer. In order to overcome such obstacles and conquer this island nation, Isabu came up with an idea to trick people of Usan-guk into surrendering.

Biography of Isabu and historical implications of his activities. The review of Isabu and east sea, 1, 241-273. Eventually, his trick worked and the people of Usan-guk surrendered. Thanks to Isabu, Usan-guk was subjugated to Silla in 512.Kim, Myung-Ki. (2010). A Study on the Legality of the Conquest over Usanguk by General Isabu of Shilla in International Law. The review of Isabu and east sea, 2, 5-37 Isabu further expanded Silla's territory after gaining supreme military power in 541, as far as former Baekje and Goguryeo territory that reached far north of present-day Hamgyong. Isabu also subjugated Daegaya that put an end to the Gaya confederacy and thus, consolidated Silla's power on southeastern part of Korea.Kang, Bong-Ryong. (2010).

Greek for \\"jointed neck\\", the arthrodires had movable joint between armor surrounding the head and body. Lacking distinct teeth, like all placoderms, they used the sharpened edges of a bony plate as a biting surface. The eye sockets are protected by a bony ring, a feature shared by birds and some ichthyosaurs. Early arthrodires, such as the genus Arctolepis, were well- armoured fishes with flattened bodies. The largest member of this group, Dunkleosteus, was a true superpredator of the latest Devonian period, reaching 1 to as much as 6 m in length. In contrast, the long-nosed Rolfosteus measured just 15 cm. Heterosteus ingens from the Middle Devonian of Estonia A common misconception is the arthrodires (along with all other placoderms) were sluggish bottom-dwellers that were outcompeted by more advanced fish. Leading to this misconception is that the arthrodire body plan remained relatively conserved (that is, the majority of arthrodires were bullet- or torpedo- shaped) during the Devonian period, save for increasing in size. However, during their reign, the arthrodires were one of the most diverse and numerically successful, if not the most successful, vertebrate orders of the Devonian, occupying a vast spectrum of roles from apex predator to detritus- nibbling bottom dweller. Despite their success, the arthrodires were one of many groups eliminated by the environmental catastrophes of the Late Devonian extinction, allowing other fish such as sharks to diversify into the vacated ecological niches during the Carboniferous period.

The class was introduced in 1985 and went through a number of evolutions in subsequent editions of the game. Publication history =Creative origins= The barbarian is based on Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian, Gardner Fox's Kothar and to a lesser extent Fritz Lieber's Fafhrd. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition= The first official barbarian character class was introduced by Gary Gygax in Dragon #63 (July 1982), as a sub-class of fighter. The barbarian later appears in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons manual, Unearthed Arcana in 1985. The barbarian, along with the cavalier, received a revision in Dragon magazine #148 (August 1989), as the author David Howery felt that the class as described in Unearthed Arcana was \\"too powerful and too vaguely defined.\\" Another version of the barbarian appeared as a character class in the original Oriental Adventures in 1985. According to a reviewer for White Dwarf, the barbarian was \\"altered to fit into an Eastern pattern\\", and was \\"primarily a steppes warrior, or a forest and jungle dweller\\". =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition= Barbarians appear in The Complete Fighter's Handbook as a character kit, and later receive full attention as a stand-alone class in The Complete Barbarian's Handbook. =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= Barbarian is one of the base character classes presented in the Player's Handbook. The barbarian is seen as the archetypal warrior who uses brute strength and raw fury to excel in combat, instead of the honed skills of the Fighter or measured strength of the Monk. Of all the classes, only the barbarian begins the game illiterate and is forced to expend extra skill points or multiclass in order to read and write. Half-Orcs have Barbarian as a favored class. Barbarians can tap their inner fury to fly into a berserker-like rage. Once the rage is expended, the barbarian becomes fatigued for the remainder of the encounter. Rage provides bonuses to Strength, Constitution, and Will saving throws (which can make barbarians surprisingly resistant to harmful magic), and a glut of additional hit points which expire along with their rage. Rage also reduces armour class and interferes with any skill requiring patience or concentration. As barbarians gain in power, their rage can be used more often and provides even larger Strength and Constitution bonuses, while taking less of a toll on their bodies. The Iconic barbarian is Krusk, a male half-orc. =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= The barbarian appears in the 4th edition as a player character class in Player's Handbook 2 (2009). As strikers, barbarians are focused on single target damage. Some defender or leader capabilities are also available to the class. Barbarians are proficient in melee weapons and light armor. Barbarians use the primal power source. Two barbarian builds have been detailed, the Rageblood Barbarian, which focuses on the Rageblood Vigor form of Feral Might, Strength and Constitution and leans towards the defender role, and the Thaneborn Barbarian, which focuses on Strength, Charisma and a different form of Feral Might, and leans towards the leader role. Barbarians' powers are called Evocations. The Rageblood Berserker paragon path was first presented in the 2008 preview for Player's Handbook 2. The Player's Handbook 2 has several barbarian paragon paths, including the Bear Warrior, Fearbringer Thane, Frenzied Berserker and Wildrunner. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The barbarian is as a character class in the Player's Handbook. It encompasses two subclasses, known as primal paths: the Path of the Berserker and the path of the Totem Warrior. The Path of the Berserker archetype heightens a barbarians rage allowing for more savage attacks, while the Totem Warrior imbues them with some animal attributes. Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide included the Battlerager, exclusive to dwarves and allowing them to wear and utilise damaging spiked armor. Xanathar's Guide to Everything added three more paths: Ancestral Guardian, Storm Herald, and Zealot. The Ancestral Guardian provides supernatural defensive protection to allied creatures, the Storm Herald emits storm-themed auras that damage foes and shield allies when the barbarian's Rage feature is activated, and the Zealot empowers their attacks with divine energy and can be easily brought back from death. Barbarians focus on defensive power. They have the highest average hit points of any class, and they gain access to a powerful unarmored defense feature. In combat, their rage feature grants them resilience against common damage types, and can be extended by taking or dealing damage. Barbarians in specific campaign settings =Eberron= In most Dungeons & Dragons games, the barbarian is represented as a savage, tribal warrior. However, in the Eberron campaign setting, barbarians are more like nomads ‚Äî while they may not be civilized, they are certainly not savages. =Forgotten Realms= Barbarians in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting are similar in presentation as the class presented in the core rulebook. Barbarians can be of any race in the Realms, though some are more uncommon than others. Barbarians are described as being confused by the cosmopolitan nature of certain regions of Faer√ªn.  Reception  Screen Rant rated the barbarian class as the 8th most powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition. The Gamer rated the 5th edition barbarian subclass Path Of The Zealot as the 2nd most awesome subclass out of the 32 new character options in Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything. Gus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \\"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D; Beyond from\\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, barbarians were the fourth most created at 9,063 total. Goliath (1,729) were the most common racial combination followed by half-orc (1,709) and then human (1,435). References External links * D&D; Wiki has all the SRD Classes, along with the Barbarian.

It was financed by regular deductions from seamen's pay, which were deposited in a chest held at Chatham Dockyard and disbursed upon proof of a sailor's disability. The fund ceased operation in 1803 when it was merged with an equivalent pension scheme run by Greenwich Hospital. The actual Chatham Chest has since been displayed at the National Maritime Museum in London and at The Mast House at Chatham Historic Dockyard. Origin Originally conceived as a charity, the Chatham Chest was established after seamen who had been disabled in the war against Spain petitioned Queen Elizabeth for relief and maintenance. Credit for its founding may belong to Charles Howard, the Lord High Admiral of England, who promoted the concept at court. The Chest itself was a strong iron box with five locks, located at Chatham Dockyard under the protection of the Chatham Division of the Royal Marines. Keys for the Chest were held by five separate officials to reduce the risk of individual embezzlement.Kemp 1970, pp.22-23 Payments and rates Payments into the Chest were made as compulsory deductions from the pay of each Royal Navy seaman. From 1594 to 1649, deductions were set at of a seaman's wages, equivalent in 1626 to a sixpence from the monthly pay of fifteen shillings. In 1649 the standard seaman's wage was increased to nineteen shillings and a differential deduction introduced, of sixpence a month for ordinary seamen, eight pence for surgeons and ten pence for chaplains.Kemp 1970, p. 27 Pensions were granted on a fixed scale, ranging from ¬£6.13s.4d per annum for the loss of a limb to ¬£15 per annum for the loss of both arms. In addition each pensioner was granted an immediate lump sum, generally equal to one year's pension, called \\"smart money\\". Difficulties During its long life the Chest experienced many difficulties. Until the late eighteenth century, and particularly before 1660, seamen's wages were often significantly less than the official rates while payments to the Chest remained fixed. As a consequence many seamen were required to contribute amounts exceeding of their pay. Despite the mechanism of five separate officials being required to open the Chest, large quantities of funds went missing. Further, in the early 1620s King Charles I simply appropriated the Chest's contents for payment of unrelated debts. By 1660 the number of pensioners had increased during the First Dutch War and the war against Spain, but when peace returned and the ships were paid off, the Chest's income dramatically decreased. The first expedient adopted was to offer pensioners voluntary commutation of their pensions, based on two years' purchase, but still the Chest found it difficult to pay the remaining pensions. Samuel Pepys, Clerk of the Acts to the Navy Board, took a great interest in the affairs of the Chest and reported in his diary (18 June 1667) that there was no money to pay the pensioners \\"at their public pay the 14th of this month, which will make us a scorn to the world.\\" Treasury funds were obtained and taken down the Thames by barge to Chatham, and the immediate crisis was staved off. From about 1673 onwards it was tacitly accepted that the Government would meet the excess of expenditure over income each year on a \\"pay as you go\\" basis. This principle remained in force, though sometimes the Government was late in paying and pensions fell into arrears. In 1690 some pensions were as much as three years outstanding. The Chest also experienced a substantial increase in the number of pensioners during the Napoleonic Wars, rising to 5,205 in 1802. Merger John Burnet, 1855 Following an Act of Parliament in 1803 the functions of the Chest were merged with the welfare programmes of Greenwich Hospital.Kemp 1970, p. 63 The merger was completed in 1814, and the physical Chest was removed from use. It was subsequently displayed at London's National Maritime Museum, and at The Mast House in Chatham Historic Dockyard.

He took four wickets against NSW and 4‚Äì70 against India. He was called into the Australian side for the second Test against India replacing an injured Alan Hurst. He took 3‚Äì84 and 4‚Äì77 (including a spell of 4‚Äì13), helping Australia win by two wickets. This effort meant Gannon kept his place for the next two Tests. He took only four wickets over the next two Tests, both of which Australia dropped. Gannon was dropped for the 5th Test against India and subsequent tour of West Indies in favour of Ian Callen. According to one report, \\"Gannon captured 11 wickets at 32.82 in his three Tests, but most of his victims were tailenders, and the top order Indian batsmen seldom experienced difficulty against him..\\" At the beginning of the 1978‚Äì79 season, selector Neil Harvey said Gannon was a prospect for Test selection. However he was not picked and the season turned out to be his last. Post playing career Following his retirement from cricket, Gannon became a highly successful businessman. Gannon was elected chairman of the Western Australian Cricket Association in August 2013.

He was an independent presidential candidate in the 2006 general election before dropping out and joining the Kampala mayoral race. Background and education He was born in Kampala, Uganda's capital city, on 15 November 1947. Nasser died on 26 September 2020. Career Following the expulsion of Asians by Idi Amin in 1972, Nasser Sebaggala acquired a supermarket called UGANTICO on Nkrumah road the lower entrance to current CHAM towers an electronics and clothes store on Kampala Road, the main thoroughfare in Kampala. His business interests grew over time. In 1998, he began his political career by running for the position of Mayor of Kampala. Ostensibly a member of the Democratic Party, Sebaggala won the first direct elections for mayor of Kampala in 1998, beating two government-sponsored candidates. However, he was arrested in the United States two months later, in June 1998, on eight counts of fraud and lying to U.S. customs officials. In February 1999, he received a 15-month sentence but was paroled in December 1999. He returned to Kampala in February 2000 to a warm welcome and considered a bid in the 2001 presidential elections. In mid-December 2005, he broke with the Democratic Party (DP), after he came third in the party presidential primaries, which was won by Ssebaana Kizito, and registered himself as an independent. A week later, he reversed his decision, withdrawing his candidacy and announcing his support for Kizito. When he lost the Democratic Party nominations to Norbert Mao in 2010, he quit the DP and formed his own party.

(\\"Special Search List Great Britain\\") was a secret list of prominent British residents to be arrested, produced in 1940 by the SS as part of the preparation for the proposed invasion of Britain codenamed Unternehmen Seel√∂we (Operation Sea Lion). After the war, the list became known as The Black Book. ‚Äì Geheim! (Secret!) is printed in red on the grey-green cover. The information was prepared by the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) under Reinhard Heydrich. Later, SS-Oberf√ºhrer Walter Schellenberg claimed in his memoirs that he had compiled the list, starting at the end of June 1940. It contained 2,820 names of people, including British nationals and European exiles, who were to be immediately arrested by SS Einsatzgruppen upon the invasion, occupation, and annexation of Great Britain to the Third Reich. Abbreviations after each name indicated whether the individual was to be detained by RSHA Amt IV (the Gestapo) or Amt VI (Ausland- SD, Foreign Intelligence). The list was printed as a supplement or appendix to the secret Informationsheft G.B. handbook, which Schellenberg also claimed to have written. This handbook noted opportunities for looting, and named potentially dangerous anti-Nazi institutions including Masonic lodges, the Church of England and the Boy Scouts. On 17 September 1940, SS-Brigadef√ºhrer Dr Franz Six was designated to a position in London where he would implement the post-invasion arrests and actions against institutions, but on the same day, Hitler postponed the invasion indefinitely. In September 1945, at the end of the war, the list was discovered in Berlin. Reporting included the reactions of some of the people listed. Background SS functionary Walter Schellenberg said he had compiled the Black Book The list was similar to earlier lists prepared by the SS, such as the Special Prosecution Book-Poland () prepared before the Second World War by members of the German fifth column in cooperation with German Intelligence, and used to target the 61,000 Polish people on this list during Operation Tannenberg and Intelligenzaktion in occupied Poland between 1939 and 1941. Rapid German victories led quickly to the Fall of France and British forces had to be withdrawn during the Dunkirk evacuation, with the Nazi spearhead reaching the coast on 21 May 1940. It was only then that the prospect of invading Britain was raised with Hitler, and the German high command did not issue any orders for preparations until 2 July. Eventually, on 16 July, Hitler issued his Directive no. 16 ordering preparation for invasion, codenamed Operation Sea Lion. German intelligence set out to provide their invading forces with encyclopaedic handbooks giving useful information. Seven maps, each covering the whole of the British Isles, covered different topographical aspects. A book provided 174 photographs, mostly aerial photography, supplemented with views cut out from newspapers and magazines. A mass of information was included in a book on Military- Geographical Data about England. Only one book was marked secret, the Informationsheft GB. Walter Schellenberg wrote in his memoirs that \\"at the end of June 1940 I was ordered to prepare a small handbook for the invading troops and the political and administrative units that would accompany them, describing briefly the most important political, administrative and economic institutions of Great Britain and the leading public figures.\\" Description The Sonderfahndungsliste G.B. was an appendix or supplement to the secret handbook Informationsheft Grossbritannien (Informationsheft GB) which provided information for German security services about institutions thought likely to resist the Nazis, including the private public schools, the Church of England and the Boy Scouts. A general survey of British museums and art galleries suggested opportunities for looting. The handbook described the organisation of the British police, and had a section analysing the British intelligence agencies. Following this, four pages had around 30 passport-sized photographs of individuals who also appeared in the appendix. The appendix, of 104 pages, was a list in alphabetical orderWalter Schellenberg, The Schellenberg Memoirs, London 1956 (Deutsch: Aufzeichungen, M√ºnchen 1979)Invasion 1940. The Nazi Invasion Plan for Britain by SS General Walter Schellenberg, London 2000 of 2,820 names, some of which were duplicated. The term Fahndungsliste translates into \\"wanted list\\", and Sonderfahndungsliste into \\"specially\\" or \\"especially wanted list\\". The instructions \\"S√§mtliche in der Sonderfahndungsliste G.B. aufgef√ºrten Personen sind festzunehmen\\" (\\"all persons listed in the Special Wanted List G.B. are to be arrested\\") made this clear. Beside each name was the number of the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) to which the person was to be handed over. Churchill was to be placed into the custody of Amt VI (Ausland-SD, Foreign Intelligence), but the vast majority of the people listed in the Black Book would be placed into the custody of Amt IV (Gestapo). The book had some significant errors, such as people who had died (Lytton Strachey, died in 1932) or were no longer based in the UK (Paul Robeson, moved back to the United States in 1939), and omissions (such as George Bernard Shaw, one of the few English language writers whose works were published and performed in Nazi Germany).Schellenberg, Invasion, 1940, p. 150 The dimension of the booklet is given as , and \\"Geheim!\\" (\\"Secret!\\") is printed on the cover. The facsimile version shows the printing in red, on a pale grey-green cover, and has 376 pages. Post-war discovery A print run of the list produced around 20,000 booklets but the warehouse in which they were stored was destroyed in a bombing raid and only two originals are known to survive. One is in the Imperial War Museum in London, and one is noted in the Hoover Institution Library and Archives. On 14 September 1945, The Guardian reported that the booklet had been discovered in the Berlin headquarters of the Reich Security Police (Reich Main Security Office). When told the previous day that they were on the Gestapo's list, Lady Astor (\\"enemy of Germany\\") said \\"It is the complete answer to the terrible lie that the so-called 'Cliveden Set' was pro-Fascist\\", while Lord Vansittart said \\"The German black-list might indicate to some of those who now find themselves on it that their views, divergent from mine, were somewhat misplaced. Perhaps it will be an eye-opener to them\\", and the cartoonist David Low said \\"That is all right. I had them on my list too.\\" Being included on the list was considered a mark of honour.

His work includes the comic panel Ballard Street, which has run since 1991 (discontinued April 30, 2019). Before 1991 he drew a comic panel entitled The Neighborhood for ten years. He has been recognized with the National Cartoonist Society Newspaper Panel Award for 2004 and 2006 for his work on Ballard Street. Van Amerongen's work is currently distributed by Creators Syndicate. Biography Van Amerongen was born and raised in Grand Rapids, Michigan. After seventeen years in corporate sales, marketing and product management, Van Amerongen switched to cartooning at the age of 40. Jerry Van Amerongen‚Äôs single panel cartoon The Neighborhood ran in newspapers throughout the United States from 1980-1990. The comic was similar in format and content to Gary Larson‚Äôs The Far Side, employing a single panel gag cartoon infused with surreal humor. Van Amerongen discontinued The Neighborhood and began Ballard Street in 1991. Ballard Street ran as a multi-panel strip until 1993, when Van Amerongen reverted to the single panel format employed by The Neighborhood. Van Amerongen's cartoon ideas come from scribbles and drawings as often as they do from preconceived ideas. The drawings themselves rely on facial expressions and body postures to give readers additional information beyond the caption, providing the motivation behind the action. Boyhood memories shaped by the ethnic influences of his Dutch and Polish heritage, images of roly-poly women in print dresses and rotund men in baggy trousers, shape the look of his characters. ‚ÄúRegardless of our physical appearance, we see ourselves as having wrinkles and rumples on the inside. We all perceive ourselves as having big bottoms‚Äù. In April 2004, Van Amerongen's Giclee prints and some original pieces were presented during a one-man show at the Every Picture Tells A Story Gallery in Santa Monica, California. His Ballard Street was awarded the Best Newspaper Cartoon Panel Of The Year Award by the National Cartoonist Society in 2004 and 2006.

He took 132 district wickets before transferring to Richmond in 1972. =First Class career= He made his d√©but for Victoria against Western Australia in 1970-71, taking four wickets. His best performances that summer was taking five wickets against South Australia. He had to take some time off from cricket in November due to exams, thus missing games against the touring English XI. During the 1971-72 season, Higgs took his first five wicket haul at first class level with 5-162 against South Australia. He picked up eight wickets against West Australia and four against South Australia. At the start of the 1972-73 season there was some talk Higgs might be a possibility for a spot in the squad to tour the West Indies at the end of the summer. However his form was less impressive, apart from six wickets against South Australia, and he was dropped from the Victorian side and replaced by Ray Bright.\\"Higgs Out of Team\\", The Age, Jan 16, 1973 accessed 4 December 2013 Higgs started the following summer strongly with seven wickets against Queensland but was never as successful again ‚Äì indeed he was made 12th man for some games. However, in a Richmond versus Northcote game he took 8 for 19. 1974‚Äì75 was Higgs' breakthrough season. He took 8-66 and 3-52 against Western Australia, 3-107 against the touring English, five against Queensland, eight against NSW and six against South Australia. He finished the summer with 42 wickets at an average of 21.92 and was subsequently selected for the Ashes tour in 1975 to England. =1975 Ashes Tour= Ashley Mallett was Australian spinner at the time so Higgs did not play a Test on tour, but gained fame by not scoring a run for the whole tour. He batted twice and was bowled by the only ball he faced (against Leicestershire), which appealed to his humorous character. Higgs' first class highlights included four wickets against Kent, six against the MCC and seven against Somerset. He took 27 wickets at an average of 32 with a first class batting average of 0. He injured his finger during the tour but played on regardless. Higgs, along with Richie Robinson, did not take part in the reduced 14-man squad that participated in the 1975 World Cup. Higgs did not enjoy as bountiful a time in 1975-76 apart from 4-86 against South Australia. Terry Jenner was picked ahead of him in the test team. In the 1976-77 season, Higgs took 4-90 against South Australia and 5-90 in the district cricket final, helping secure Richmond a premiership, breaking a 30-year drought. However, by this stage Kerry O'Keeffe was Australia's preferred leg spinner and Ray Bright was the favoured second spinner. Ian Chappell wrote in a 1977 article that Higgs, along with fellow spinner David Hourn, \\"In my opinion neither of them are real cricketers. By that I mean they are only bowlers, not cricketers. They are both well below standard as fieldsmen and batsmen.\\" =1977-78 World Series Cricket= With the introduction of World Series Cricket, vacancies arose in the Australian team, especially for the spin bowling spot, as Kerry O'Keefe, Ashley Mallett and Ray Bright were all banned and no longer considered available for selection. Higgs took 6-131 against the touring Indians, which put him in the frame for the Australian side however Tony Mann was selected instead. Mann kept his place for the first four tests before being replaced by Bruce Yardley in the fifth. Both were better batsmen than Higgs, whose next best performance that summer was five wickets against West Australia. However Higgs was picked on the tour to the West Indies as the second spinner apart from Yardley. =1977-78: Tour of West Indies and Test Debt= Higgs started the West Indies tour spectacularly well, taking 6-91 and 6-71 against the Leeward Islands. This earned him selection in the first test as part of a spin duo with Bruce Yardley; Higgs took 4-91, the best performing Australian, but Australia lost the test by an innings. He took 1-46 and 1-34 in the second test and did not play the third. In the fourth, Higgs' four wickets helped put Australia in a winning position but a second innings batting collapse saw them lose. Playing Jamaica, Higgs got 5-73 and 4-43. In the final test Higgs took five wickets ‚Äì 2-47 and 3-67; he and Yardley were on the verge of bowling Australia to victory when the crowd rioted and the game was called off. Higgs took 42 first class wickets at an average of 22 on the tour. =1978-79 Ashes= Higgs had come back form the West Indies with his reputation considerably enhanced. He took 3-82 against the touring Englishmen, and 4-72 against Western Australia Higgs and Yardley were kept as Australia's spinners for the first test against England, but could not prevent a comfortable English victory; Higgs' returns were 0-9 and 0-43.Australia vs England 1st test 1978-79 at Cricinfo Higgs was not picked in the second test but took 4-86 against NSW then 6-85 in another match against the same team. Higgs came back to the Australian side for the third test, where his three wickets contributed to a rare Australian win. Higgs' best performance of the summer came in the fourth test, where he took eight wickets including 5-148 in England's second innings, meaning Australia only had to score 205 to win. However they collapsed and Australia lost. Higgs took three wickets in the fifth test and five in the sixth (4-69 and 1-12) both Australian defeats. He was dropped from the Australian side for the second test against Pakistan, replaced by Bruce Yardley. Higgs rounded out the summer with 5-35 and 2-23 against Tasmania. Victoria won the Sheffield Shield that season, Higgs' 51 first class wickets playing no small part. =1979 Tour of India= Higgs was picked on the 1979 tour of India, along with Yardley and Peter Sleep. Five wickets against South Zone got his tour off to a strong start. Higgs took 7-143 in the first test (a draw). The rest of the series was harder going; for the second he got 1-95 and took no wickets in the third. 3-63 and 3-22 against the West Zone restored his confidence but he went for 3-150 in the fourth test (bowling in tandem with Peter Sleep) 1-107 in the fifth, and 2-116 in the sixth. =1979-80= From 1979-80 onwards, the World Series Cricket players were eligible for selection in the Australian team again. Higgs started the 1979-80 season well with 5-50 and 7-49 against West Australia and 4-79 and 4-78 against NSW. This saw him recalled to the Australian team in the second test against the West Indies, replacing Jeff Thomson. Higgs went for an expensive 3-122 in an Australian loss. He was kept on in the side to play England, but only bowled one over. The good form continued at domestic level, with 4-90 against Qld, 4-18 against Tasmania and 6-57 against South Australia. These returns helped Victoria win another Sheffield Shield and Higgs' seasonal record was 41 wickets at an average of 20. Higgs was selected in the initial squad to tour Pakistan in 1980 but did not actually tour. This meant he could be available to play the end of the Shield. He also announced his unavailability to tour on the 1980 tour of England. =1980-81= Higgs started the 1980-81 season more slowly, although he did take three wickets for Victoria against the touring New Zealanders. 2-65 and 4-67 against WA saw him picked in the Australian side to face New Zealand for the first test. His first innings effort 4-59 against New Zealand helped Australia win the game and a return of 4-25 in the second innings helped them win the second. Higgs picked up 3 wickets in the third test ‚Äì a game probably best remembered for an incident when Higgs was batting. He was 1 not out and Australia 9-279 with Doug Walters on 77 when Lance Cairns bowled a bouncer; Higgs hit it to the wicketkeeper but umpire Robin Baillache ruled the delivery an illegal one as it was too intimidatory. Higgs went on to score 6 off 69 balls, Walters hit a century, Australia made 321 and ended up winning the game.Cliip of dismissal at YouTube Against India, a second innings haul of 4-25 helped bowl Australia to victory in the first test though he took no wickets in the third (0-65 and 0-41), which Australia lost. This was Higgs' last test. In February 1981 Ian Chappell said he would not pick Higgs for the English tour even though he felt Higgs was \\"the most productive spinner in Australia. English wickets are no help to leggies and Jim really struggled on the 1975 tour.\\" =Later career= Higgs was appointed captain of Richmond in 1981-82. He never made the Australian team again but took six wickets against Tasmania in a Shield game, seven wickets against WA. and 5-68 against WA His last first class game was in 1982-83 against Queensland; Higgs' figures were 0-90 and 2-24. He led Richmond to a premiership in 1982-83. Higgs retired at the end of the 1982-83 season because of persistent back problems. =Selector= He was a Victorian selector from 1982-83 to 1988-89 and was appointed an Australian selector in 1985-86\\\\. He was also president of Richmond from 1994‚Äì97 and served on the Board of Cricket Victoria.

A D&D; monk is a fantasy martial artist, specializing in unarmed combat. Publication history =Original Dungeons & Dragons= The original monk character class was created by Brian Blume, inspired by the fictional martial arts of the Destroyer series of novels.E. Gary Gygax, \\"Preface\\", Oriental Adventures (1st edition, 1986): \\"In its early development, the D&D; game was supplemented by various booklets, and in one of these the monk, inspired by Brian Blume and the book series called The Destroyer, was appended to the characters playable. So too was this cobbled-together martial arts specialist placed into the AD&D; game system, even as it was being removed from the D&D; game.\\" The monk was introduced in 1975's Blackmoor supplement. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition= The monk was a main character class in the first edition Players Handbook. The monk was presented as one of the five core classes in the original Players Handbook. In 1981, Philip Meyers argued that \\"the monk is the weakest of the character classes\\" in an article published in Dragon Magazine #53 (later reprinted in Best of Dragon, Volume III). Meyers offered an extensive unofficial revision to the class, expanding and strengthening many of its game abilities (for example, increasing the monk's hit dice by 50%, raising the maximum level from 17 to 21, and adding class abilities as a \\"form of psionic power\\").Meyers, Philip. Dragon #53, pp. 7-9. In 1985, the next official revision of the monk appeared as a character class in the first edition Oriental Adventures rulebook, by Gary Gygax and David Cook.Gygax, Gary, with David Cook, and Fran√ßois Marcela-Froideval. Oriental Adventures (TSR, 1985) This version retained most of the class as presented in the first edition Players Handbook, but replaced the abstract hand-to-hand attacks with a more specific rules system to emulate different styles of martial arts (such as karate, judo, etc.). According to a reviewer for White Dwarf, this version of the monk was \\"altered to fit into an Eastern pattern\\", and was \\"at last in the proper context\\". =Basic Dungeons & Dragons= The monk was available as a character class known as a \\"mystic\\" in the game's \\"Basic\\" edition, introduced in the Dungeons & Dragons Master Set. =Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition= The monk was dropped as one of the standard character classes available in the second edition. The Complete Priest's Handbook did, however, allow for clerics to take on some aspects of the monk class via the monk kit. This version of the monk retained clerical spellcasting and gained unarmed combat skills. The monk was reintroduced as a second edition class of the priest group in Faiths & Avatars and Player's Option: Spells & Magic. This version of the monk is a fully playable character class, but differs significantly from previous incarnations of the monk. This version of the monk gains priestly spells (though from different spheres of influence than the cleric) and retains skill with unarmed attacks and unarmored defenses, but no other abilities attributed to earlier versions of the monk. With the release of The Complete Psionics Handbook, many of the psionic or psionic-like abilities of the 1st edition monk became available in 2nd edition, though the 2nd edition monk was not given these abilities. The monk was also reintroduced in The Scarlet Brotherhood for the Greyhawk setting, along with the Assassin class. This version is a direct update of the first edition class, and has no clerical powers. =Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition= With the release of the third edition rules, the monk was reintroduced as a class. =Dungeons & Dragons 4th edition= A preview version of the class was published online in the 375th issue of Dragon, released in May 2009. As published in Player's Handbook III,Mike Mearls, Bruce R. Cordell, Robert J. Schwalb (2010). Player's Handbook III Wizards of the Coast. . the Monk uses the Psionic power source, but may use ki focuses (similar in use to implements used by spellcasting classes) to add enhancements to his unarmed attacks. The monk class now makes it possible for them to use weapons effectively, even allowing them to be used as implements for some powers. In the absence of proficiency with high-damage weapons, however, the monk is still primarily an unarmed class. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition= The monk has been included as a character class in the 5th edition Player's Handbook. It features three Monastic Traditions a Monk can choose from: the Way of the Open Hand, the Way of Shadow and the Way of the Four Elements. In the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, two new traditions are introduced: The Way of the Long Death and the Way of the Sun Soul. Later, in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, two more traditions are added: The Way of the Drunken Master and the Way of the Kensei. The Way of the Open Hand are the master of martial arts, allowing monks to manipulate ki in combat. Way of the Shadow monks are sneaky and stealthy, allowing monks to use ki to hide themselves. Way of the Four Elements monks are masters of harnessing the elements through ki. The Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide adds the Way of the Long Death, allowing monks to use ki to manipulate life and death itself, and the Way of the Sun Soul, which allows monks to channel their life energy into attacks. Finally, Xanathar's Guide to Everything introduces the Way of the Drunken Master, improving mobility, luck and speed in the heat of battle with the unpredictability of the drunkard, and the Way of the Kensei, which grants monks mastery over ki-empowered weapon usage.  Reception  Screen Rant rated the monk class as the 2nd to least powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition. The Gamer rated the 5th edition monk subclass Way Of The Sun Soul as the most awesome subclass out of the 32 new character options in Xanathar‚Äôs Guide to Everything. Gus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \\"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D; Beyond from\\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, monks were 9th in player creations at 7,892 total. Human (1,946) was the most common racial combination followed by elf (1,349) and then aarakocra (835). Further reading *Skip Williams, Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook.

He is best known for his novel Imperium in Imperio, a utopian work that envisions a separate African-American state within the United States. Biography =Early years= Griggs was born Elbert Sutton Griggs (he later changed the order of his given names) in 1872 in Chatfield, Texas, to the Rev. Allen R. and Emma Hodge Griggs. His father, a former Georgia slave, became a prominent Baptist minister and founder of the first black newspaper and high school in Texas. Sutton worked closely with his father on the National Baptist Convention's Education Committee. He wrote frequently later in life of his deep respect for his parents' characters and accomplishments.Literary Encyclopedia entry by Harish Chander, Shaw University. Sutton Griggs attended Bishop College in Marshall, Texas and Richmond Theological Seminary. Upon graduation, he became pastor of the First Baptist Church in Berkley, Virginia. There he married Emma Williams, a teacher, in 1897. In 1899, he became pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church in East Nashville and corresponding secretary of the National Baptist Convention. =Career= Griggs was a prolific author, writing more than thirty books and pamphlets in his lifetime and selling them door-to-door or at the revival meetings at which he preached. His first novel, Imperium in Imperio, published in 1899, is his most famous. In 1901, Griggs founded the Orion Publishing Company to sell books to the African American market. None of his four subsequent novels achieved the success of Imperium in Imperio, but he produced a steady stream of social and religious tracts, as well as an autobiography. An admirer of W. E. B. Du Bois and a supporter of the Niagara Movement and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Griggs was strongly influenced by contemporary social theory. He believed that the practice of social virtues alone could advance a culture and lead to economic success.James W. Byrd and David M. Tucker, \\"Griggs, Sutton Elbert\\", Handbook of Texas Online (accessed June 23, 2008). Published by the Texas State Historical Association The more radical ideas expressed in his novels, particularly Imperium in Imperio, have led him to be sometimes characterized as a militant separatist in the mold of Marcus Garvey. During his lifetime, however, his integrationist philosophy and courting of white philanthropy earned him the scorn of self-help advocates.\\"The Battle That Raged\\", Issues & Views, Fall 1996. Griggs's careers in both the church and social welfare sphere were active and itinerant. In Houston, he helped establish the National Civil and Religious Institute. In 1914, he founded the National Public Welfare League. From 1925 to 1926, he served as president of the American Baptist Theological Seminary, which his father helped found. His longest tenure‚Äî19 years as pastor of Tabernacle Baptist Church in Memphis‚Äîsaw him act on his belief in the social mission of churches, providing the only swimming pool and gymnasium then available to African Americans in the city. =Death and legacy= The Wall Street Crash of 1929 stripped the Tabernacle of investment funds and led to its bankruptcy. Griggs returned to Hopewell Baptist Church in Denison, Texas, then to a brief pastorship in Houston. Shortly after resigning that post in 1933, he died in Houston, and was buried in Dallas. Griggs as an author Title page of the first edition of Imperium in Imperio Griggs's first novel follows a familiar formula: two childhood friends are separated by wealth, education, skin tone, and political outlook; one is a militant and one an integrationist. A traumatic incident galvanizes the more moderate friend into action, and the two work together to redress the injustice. Imperium in Imperio (1899) follows this plotline with a startling twist: the revelation of an African American \\"empire within an empire,\\" a shadow government complete with a Congress based in Waco, Texas. The light-skinned and more militant Bernard Belgrave who has been hand-picked to serve as president advocates a takeover of the Texas state government, while the dark-skinned Belton Piedmont argues for assimilation and cooperation. Bernard reluctantly has Belton executed as a traitor only after Belton resigns from the Imperium (an act that is tantamount to suicide), leaving the potentially violent and unstable Bernard in control of the Imperium as the novel ends.Steven G. Kellman, \\"Imagining Texas as Black Utopia\\", The Texas Observer, February 27, 2004. The Hindered Hand, written in 1905 as a direct reply to Thomas Dixon's The Leopard's Spots, contains graphic accounts of sexual violence and lynching, and was among the most popular African-American novels of the period. With a stiff prose style and long rhetorical passages punctuated by melodramatic events, Griggs' novels are not models of \\"literary\\" styling. However, for the African-American audiences for which they were written, the novels provided a rare opportunity to read about the political and social issues that preoccupied them, including violence, racism, and the pursuit of political and economic justice. Although he outsold more famous contemporaries, Griggs remained largely invisible in literary histories of the time. A re-issue of Imperium by the Arno Press in 1969 revived interest in Griggs, and several editions have been published since. Imperium has been embraced as an important addition to the history of utopian literature, western fiction, and African- American literature.

He played two Test matches for Australia v England in 1978‚Äì79 Ashes series and four One Day Internationals against the same opponents. He was called up by Australia when most of their regular first- choice players were playing in World Series Cricket. Carlson took two Test wickets and two ODI wickets. Graham Gooch was his most popular victim. He dismissed him once in Tests (50% of wickets) and he got him out twice in ODI (100%). Former Australian selector John Benaud criticised the Test selection of Carlson, supposedly as an allrounder but whose \\"slow, gentle mediums\\" and batting ability at number six was not what Australian captain Graham Yallop needed.Benaud, J. \\"The second-rate eleven\\", Australian Cricket, March 1979, p. 9.

He was dropped for the third test in favour of Alan Border, although was kept on to play a one-day international. Carlson then scored a century and took ten wickets in a game against New South Wales. He followed this with 88 against South Australia. He was recalled to the Australian side for the fifth test, replacing Geoff Dymock. He performed poorly in two tests.

He was given the Reuben Award for Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year for 2010. Cul de Sac In 1982 Thompson began working at the Washington Post, and he was the newspaper's unofficial staff artist by 1985. Thompson provided illustrations for Joel Achenbach's Washington Post column and Gene Weingarten's column in The Washington Post Magazine. The weekly, watercolored incarnation of his comic Cul de Sac launched in The Washington Post Magazine on February 14, 2004. The strip focuses on a four- year-old girl, Alice Otterloop, and her daily life at preschool and at home. It was published in more than 70 newspapers by the fall of 2007. It was distributed nationally as both a daily and Sunday strip by Universal Press Syndicate. The first book collection of Cul de Sac strips, published in 2008 by Andrews McMeel, includes the pre-syndication Washington Post strips in color, as well as a foreword by Bill Watterson, who praised Thompson's work: 250px In 2009, Andrews McMeel published a second Cul de Sac collection, Children at Play, featuring a foreword by Mo Willems. Richard's Poor Almanac Thompson's cartoon series Richard's Poor Almanac appeared weekly (usually on Saturdays) in the Washington Post Style section. A compendium of his Richard's Poor Almanac cartoons was published by Emmis Books in 2005. The Richard's Poor Almanac cartoon published the week of George W. Bush's first inauguration included a mock inaugural poem, \\"Make the Pie Higher,\\" composed of some of Bush's more incoherent quotations, or \\"Bushisms\\". When \\"Make the Pie Higher\\" was leaked onto the Internet, it spread rapidly and was eventually dissected and analyzed on Snopes.com, which did a lengthy review of its origins. The poem has been set to music at least five times in various styles, including Irish and choral music. Illustrations Thompson's illustrations have appeared in U.S. News & World Report, The New Yorker, Air & Space/Smithsonian, National Geographic and The Atlantic Monthly. In 2004, Thompson illustrated Francis Heaney's Holy Tango of Literature. In 2010, he wrote and illustrated \\"Barney Google and the Bigfoot Style\\", the foreword for Craig Yoe's Barney Google: Gambling, Horse Races & High-Toned Women (Yoe Books/IDW, 2010). In 2010, the Pixar director Pete Docter hired Thompson to work on character sketches and development for his upcoming movie Inside Out. In 2014, the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum at Ohio State University hosted an exhibition of Thompson's work: \\"The Irresistible Force Meets the Immovable Object: A Richard Thompson Retrospective\\".

On July 16, 2009, Thompson announced that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, a problem he described as \\"a pain in the fundament\\", which slowed him down but did not affect his drawing hand. Stephan Pastis, creator of Pearls Before Swine, described Thompson as \\"probably the most talented all-around syndicated cartoonist working today\\" and praised the courage and optimism he showed in revealing his illness. The children's book illustrator Stacy Curtis became the inker of Cul de Sac on March 26, 2012; but by August the effects of Parkinson's were progressing, and Thompson announced that he would be ending Cul de Sac: \\"Parkinson's disease is horribly selfish and demanding. A daily comic strip is too and I can only deal with one at a time. So it was a long, gradual, sudden decision.\\" In 2012, the book Team Cul de Sac: Cartoonists Draw the Line at Parkinson's was published. It was created by his close friend Chris Sparks to honor Richard. It features the work of Bill Watterson and other cartoonists, who rallied together to raise money to benefit Team Fox, the fundraising arm of the Michael J. Fox Foundation that is working to find a cure for Parkinson's disease. In 2014, Watterson, Nick Galifianakis and David Apatoff published a collection of Thompson's artwork and illustrations: The Art of Richard Thompson. A short documentary of the same name, profiling Thompson and his work, was also produced that year, directed by Bob Burnett. In June 2016 Encore Stage & Studios in Arlington, Virginia, premiered the play Cul de Sac by Amy Thompson ‚Äî Richard's wife ‚Äî based on his comic strip. Thompson died on July 27, 2016, from complications of Parkinson's disease.

They are distinct from district nurses, who provide clinical healthcare, domestically.  Responsibilities  Health visitors are mainly concerned with helping to ensure that people's domestic behaviour is sanitary, hygienic, and beneficial to the welfare of themselves and their families, particularly to their children. As their name suggests, they fulfill their role in the community, by visiting family homes, to give advice and support to all age groups. They have a key role with regard to safeguarding vulnerable people, as they are often the first experts to enter the homes of individuals at risk of abuse and neglect, especially children. A check at two years of age is now a major part of the standard provision. If the health visitor suspects that matters were serious enough to warrant child protection measures, it is their responsibility to initiate the process of intervention. The dual role of advice and inspection has made some families wary of health visitors, despite being appreciative of their potential for assistance. In addition to their early years work, health visitors have now started to run health promotion schemes such as stop-smoking services, and to deliver certain vaccination programmes. Many health visitors are represented professionally by the Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association, which is part of Unite the Union.  History  At the time the health visiting profession began, living conditions for the urban poor were often cramped and extremely insanitary, leading to many business owners sending women around to workers' homes to educate their wives about sanitation and nutrition. The initial focus of health visiting was on families with young children. Visits would cover topics such as sanitation, feeding, nutrition, care, and support to both infants and parents. Typically there would be regular visits throughout a child's early years, to provide routine child development checks. Issues of hygiene, malnutrition, or disease, would be corrected with suitable advice, and reported to the relevant authorities where appropriate The role of Health visitors was formalised with the establishment of the Ladies Sanitary Reform Association in 1862. By 1890 some local councils were paying the salaries of Health Visitors. = Early twentieth century = The role of health visitors was given greater weight following the Notification of Births Acts 1907 and 1915 and the Maternity and Child Welfare Act 1918 which empowered local authorities to establish maternal and child welfare services and led to the first training courses for health visitors. In 1929, health visitors began to be employed by local councils on a statutory basis and since 1974 they have been employed by the National Health Service. = Post-war = Beginning in 1945, health visitors operating in the UK were required to be Registered Nurses or Midwives who had undertaken further training to work as part of a primary health care team. In the 1950s, their interventions were made more extensive to ensure they could provide a cradle-to-grave service, working also with the elderly and chronically ill. In 1962, the Health Visiting and Social Work (Training) Act established the Council for the Training of Health Visitors (CTHV) and the Council for Training in Social Work (CTSW). The CTHV comprised 31 members of whom 14 were appointed by the Minister of Health. In 1970 the title of the CTHV was changed to the Council for the Education and Training of Health Visitors (CETHV). = Post-1997 = Under the Blair Ministry, rising case-loads were considered to be affecting the potential quality of interventions in young families. As a result, their work was refocused back to young families; the reduced intervention in elderly care has been accompanied by a commensurate rise in admissions of elderly patients to A+E departments and care homes. After Sure Start was introduced, to provide general early years support to families, the refocusing on young families lead many health visitors to use Sure Start centres as their base. The Healthy Child Programme, published in October 2009, influences the core service available to families, breaking it down into two age groups : firstly the first 5 years, and secondly 5-19 year olds. The latter age group are traditionally dealt with by school nurses - a public health nurse embedded within, or frequenting a school - with health visitors handing over responsibility to them, for a child's development and welfare, once the child starts to attend school. The 2010 Coalition Government sought to reverse the move towards reducing the scope of health visitors by giving a commitment to recruit more health visitors, to ensure that their caseloads were not negatively impacted.Health Visitor implementation plan 2011 to 2015 The government's reorganisation of the NHS returned responsibility for public health, at a local level, to local councils once again, with national issues and oversight being provided by Public Health England. Health visitor services will therefore now be commissioned by local councils, in partnership with clinical commissioning groups.  Numbers of health visitors  In 1977 there were 10,623 health visitors in the UK. In 2015 there were 12,292 in England and Wales, an increase from 10,046 in 2000. In 2000 there were 297 children under 5 per health visitor, a figure which rose to 419 in 2011. UK training In the early days of statutory health visiting, training in the UK was overseen by the Royal Sanitary Institute, who later evolved into the Royal Society for Public Health. Training was later taken over by the government's Ministry of Health, and they are now regulated by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Post-qualification, a 1-year full-time (or equivalent part-time) degree or masters level course.  Sources of further information  The Journal of Health Visiting, launched in January 2013, is a monthly peer- reviewed journal for health visitors. Researchers interested in the history of health visitors may be interested in consulting the Welcome Trust's London's Pulse collection, which provides a digital archive of London's Medical Officer of Health reports, for the period 1848-1972. These reports often referred to the activities of health visitors.

He played for New South Wales from 1977 to 1981 and for South Australia from 1982 to 1992. He was an Australian cricket selector from 1996 until 2011. Early career Hilditch was born in North Adelaide, South Australia, but made his First-class debut for New South Wales against Tasmania in Hobart in February 1977, scoring 5 and 42. Tasmania was not yet in the Sheffield Shield and the NSW side was mostly full of younger players. Hilditch played a further four matches for NSW in 1977/78 when the NSW side was weakened through the loss of players to World Series Cricket. He filled in as NSW captain in only his third match for them. First time in Australian team The 1978/79 season was the breakthrough for Hilditch, establishing himself as a regular opener in the NSW side, scoring 778 runs at 45.76. His maiden first-class century came in his birth city of Adelaide, scoring 124 against South Australia. He also scored 93 against the touring England team.NSW First-Class Season 1978/79: Averages With England leading the six-Test series 4‚Äì1, Hilditch was selected to make his Test debut in the final Test in Sydney. He scored just 3 and 1Cricinfo - Test 846 but was retained for the following two-Test series against Pakistan. In the first Test in Melbourne, Hilditch failed again in the first innings but scored a composed 62 in the second innings before being the second of nine dismissals for Sarfraz Nawaz.Cricinfo - Test 849 In the second Test in Perth, Hilditch had made 29 as Australia chased 236 for victory in their second innings. When a wayward throw from a Pakistani fieldsman dribbled onto the pitch, Hilditch picked up the ball and handed it back to the bowler, Sarfraz Nawaz. Sarfraz appealed and the umpire had no option but to uphold the letter of the law and give Hilditch out. Hilditch was only the second player to be given out handled the ball in a Test match and the first non-striker.Cricinfo - Test 850Hit wicket and handled ball - just for interest Despite playing in the 1979 Cricket World Cup and in all six Tests on the 1979/80 Australian tour to India, Hilditch was dropped from the Australian side once the World Series Cricket players were available again and even found it difficult to get a regular game for NSW. Hilditch did not play First-class cricket in the 1981/82 season. Move to South Australia For the 1982/83 season, Hilditch returned to his birth state of South Australia. He played most of the season batting at three and scored his first century (109) for his new team in Adelaide against a Tasmanian bowling attack led by West Indian Michael Holding. Hilditch returned to his preferred opening role and enjoyed a brilliant 1983/84 season for South Australia scoring 937 runs at 58.56. This run included his highest first class score of 230 against Victoria in Melbourne. Australian recall An innings of 184 against NSW in the opening match of the 1984/85 Sheffield Shield, plus a string of other good scores, led to his recall to the Australian Test team for the fourth Test against the West Indies at Melbourne. Hilditch made 70 and 113, his maiden Test century, to not only win the Man of the Match award, but also help end the West Indies then-record run of 11 consecutive Test victories. For the next Test in Sydney, Hilditch was named as Australian vice- captain. Hilditch retained his vice-captaincy role for the 1985 Australian tour of England. He began the tour, scoring 119, his highest Test innings, and 80 in the first Test loss at Headingley. He was then dismissed three times in the forties in the middle of the series. In the second Test at Lord's with Australia chasing a small target, Hilditch played a hook shot against an Ian Botham bouncer and was caught on the leg side boundary. In the fifth Test at Edgbaston, Hilditch again fell to Botham in the same manner. This happened a third time in the sixth Test at The Oval. Hilditch gained a reputation as a compulsive player of the hook shot. On returning to Australia, Hilditch played against New Zealand in Brisbane and was twice caught at fine leg, again playing the hook. Hilditch's international career was over - he was dropped from the Australian test team and never regained his place. Post-Test career Following being dropped from the test side Hilditch suffered a big loss of form.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/130635187 However he recovered and established himself for South Australia and was made captain of the side for the 1990/91 season. He finished the 1991/92 as South Australia's leading runscorer for the season and then retired to concentrate on his career in law. Hilditch re-appeared on the Australian cricket scene as a national selector in 1996/97. He became the chairman of the selection panel in April 2006 following the resignation of Trevor Hohns. When he became chairman, Australia were first placed in the ICC Test rankings, but fell to fifth place by October 2010, shortly before his removal in August 2011. Criticism by some members of the press and former players included his missing the Third Test in 2009 to walk on the beach with his daughter and dog, the removal of Brad Hodge from the test side two matches after making a double century, the selectors' use of ten spinners in the four years after the retirement of Shane Warne, and the removal of Simon Katich's contract after he had been the second highest Test run scorer in the world after Alastair Cook since his Test recall. Hilditch is the son-in-law of former Australian captain and coach, Bob Simpson. Hilditch is a partner at national law firm Barry.Nilsson. He specialises in insurance law.

In effect, the Dungeon Master controls all aspects of the game, except for the actions of the player characters (PCs), and describes to the players what they see and hear. The title was invented by Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) for the Dungeons & Dragons RPG, and was introduced in the second supplement to the game rules (Blackmoor). To avoid infringement of TSR's trademarks, and to describe referees in role-playing genres other than sword and sorcery, other gaming companies use more generic terms, like Game Master, Game Operations Director (a backronym of GOD), Judge, Referee or Storyteller. Some use more esoteric titles related to the genre or style of the game, such as the \\"Keeper of Arcane Lore\\" from Call of Cthulhu and the \\"Hollyhock God\\" from Nobilis.  Role  The Dungeon Master (DM) assumes the role of the game master or referee and describes for other players what they perceive in this imaginary world, and what effects their actions have. That person is responsible for preparing each game session, and must have a thorough understanding of the game rules. Since the inception of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons system in 1977, these rules have been contained in three hardbound books: the Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual. Many other rulebooks exist as well, but these are not required for conducting the game. The DM is responsible for narrative flow, creating the scenario and setting in which the game takes place, maintaining the pace and providing dynamic feedback. In storyteller role, the DM is responsible for describing the events of the D&D; game session and making rulings about game situations and effects based on the decisions made by the players. The DM can develop the adventure plot and setting in which these PCs participate or use a preexisting module. This is typically designed as a type of decision tree that is followed by the players, and a customized version can require several hours of preparation for each hour spent playing the game. The DM serves as the arbiter of the rules, both in teaching the rules to the players and in enforcing them. The rules provide game mechanics for resolving the outcome of events, including how the player's characters interact with the game world. Although the rules exist to provide a balanced game environment, the DM is free to ignore the rules as needed. The DM can modify, remove, or create entirely new rules in order to fit the rules to the current campaign. This includes situations where the rules do not readily apply, making it necessary to improvise. An example would be if the PCs are attacked by a living statue. To destroy the enemy, one PC soaks the statue in water, while the second uses his cone of cold breath to freeze the water. At this point, he appeals to the DM, saying the water expands as it freezes and shatters the statue. The DM might allow it, or roll dice to decide. In the above example the probability roll might come up in favor of the players, and the enemy would be shattered. Conversely, rules do not fit all eventualities and may have unintended consequences. The DM must ultimately draw the line between creative utilization of resources (e.g. firing wooden arrows into a dragon, then using a spell that warps wood at a distance) and exploit (e.g. \\"horse bombing\\" - using a non-combat spell that creates a temporary mount, several dozen feet above an enemy; hiring several thousand commoners to form a line and use a rule that allows characters to pass items to each other immediately to propel objects at railgun speeds.) Gaming groups Regular gaming groups consist of a dungeon master and several players. Some meet weekly or monthly, while others may only meet two or three times a year. A DM can also run a single adventure otherwise unconnected with a campaign or game world. In this latter case there is no connected plot, and the players can choose to play different characters in each session. The game session is typically known as an \\"adventure.\\" It can be metaphorically described as an act within a stage play, where the players are the lead actors. In this analogy, the DM provides the stage, the scenery, and the basic plot on which the improvisational script is built, as well as all the bit parts and supporting characters. Typically, each player generates a fictional player character (PC) to play within the adventure. A series of adventures generally compose a campaign, and the player's characters will often remain as elements of the continuing story arc unless they meet an unfortunate demise. Using the stage play analogy, a campaign would comprise all acts of said play. While each adventure may have its own story arc, they are usually parts of the larger story arc of the campaign. The DM strings individual adventures into this campaign, in which the same PCs fight many different monsters and a few recurring villains; the PCs gain treasure, reputation and power as they go. Such campaigns can last for years or decades, earning a great deal of loyalty from their players. Also, there can be a common theme (e. g., find the Sword of Light) to a number of adventures that may in time become a campaign of sorts. Beyond the campaign is the \\"game world\\". This vast construct is typical of many fantasy novels, such as J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth or Robert E. Howard's Conan saga. DMs may choose to run a game based on a published game world, with the maps and history already in place; such game worlds often have pre-written adventures. Alternately, the DM may build their own world and create their own adventures. In fiction In the Faiths and Pantheons Dungeons & Dragons campaign, the Faerunian Overgod Ao answers to a superior entity, insinuated to be the \\"Dungeon Master\\".

G. Wodehouse. It was first published in the United Kingdom on April 15, 1926 by Herbert Jenkins, and in the United States on March 4, 1927 by George H. Doran, New York, under the title Divots.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 50‚Äì51, A36. The stories were originally published in magazines between 1921 and 1926. The stories all concern golf, and are told by the Oldest Member. The book can be considered a sequel to The Clicking of Cuthbert (1922). Contents The original story titles and publication dates were as follows: =\\"The Heart of a Goof\\"= * UK: Strand, April 1924 * US: Red Book, September 1923 ;Plot The Oldest Member tells a young man at the club that a \\"goof\\" is someone who is unskilled at golf and becomes overly dejected because of this. He recounts the following tale of a goof, Ferdinand Dibble. The Oldest Member sees Ferdinand talking to Barbara Medway, who is about to leave for the summer to Marvis Bay. Ferdinand confides in the Oldest Member that he wants to propose to Barbara, but he lacks confidence in himself because of his poor golfing. Later, Barbara also confides in the Oldest Member. She has figured out that Ferdinand loves her and returns his feelings. She is annoyed that Ferdinand will not tell her how he feels. The Oldest Member explains that Ferdinand is a goof, and suggests that Barbara induce Ferdinand to go to Marvis Bay. The average skill of the golfers at the hotel there is notoriously low. Ferdinand will gain enough confidence by defeating them to propose to Barbara. She follows this advice. At Marvis Bay, Ferdinand is amazed by his success against the other golfers, including the lawyer Mr Tuttle, Barbara's uncle. Barbara had to postpone her visit to Marvis Bay at the last moment. Ferdinand does not mind waiting because he continues to win and become more confident. Ferdinand starts holding up games to give advice to his opponents. They resent this and plot to take him down a peg. Mr Tuttle employs a young man and relatively skilled golfer named George Parsloe, whom he invites to Marvis Bay to beat and humble Ferdinand. Ferdinand agrees to play against Parsloe. He regrets this when he sees Parsloe practising. Barbara arrives at Marvis Bay, but Ferdinand is too dejected because of Parsloe to be cheerful. She mistakenly believes he is not happy to see her and has met another girl. When Ferdinand notices the resulting change in her manner, he thinks she has fallen for Parsloe, who is an old friend of hers. While the match between Ferdinand and Parsloe is going on, Barbara hears about it in the hotel and realizes the actual reason Ferdinand seemed preoccupied. She rushes to the golf course. Her uncle tells her the two players are at the fifteenth hole and have the same score. Ferdinand became listless since he thought he lost Barbara, so he is not nervously over-thinking like usual and is playing better. Barbara suddenly speaks while Parsloe is playing and distracts him, leading to victory for Ferdinand. Barbara and Ferdinand confess their feelings for each other and plan to get married. Ferdinand knows he played better because he was too miserable to worry about his shots, and is concerned he will only be happy from now on. Barbara assures him she be able to think of a hundred ways of bothering him when they are married. Ferdinand is delighted. =\\"High Stakes\\"= * UK: Strand, October 1925 * US: Saturday Evening Post, 19 September 1925 ;Plot A young man tells the Oldest Member that two rich golfers at the club wagered money on who would win their match. The Oldest Member is reminded of the following story in which two men play for high stakes. American millionaire Bradbury Fisher plays golf and collects famous golf relics, though his wife disapproves of his collecting. Bradbury returns to New York while his wife continues her holiday in England. At his home in Goldenville, Long Island, his English butler Blizzard informs him that Gladstone Bott, another American millionaire, wants to speak with him on the telephone. Gladstone has been Bradbury's rival since they were young men at Sing-Sing, and they now have the same handicap of 24. Gladstone has acquired a baffy that Bobby Jones used as an infant and wants to exchange the baffy for Blizzard, who is the former butler of an Earl and the finest English butler on Long Island. Bradsbury agrees, and the Jones baffy arrives at Bradbury's house. He worries about what will happen if he sends Blizzard away, since his wife values Blizzard highly. The next day on the golf course, Bradbury insults Gladstone's golfing ability and goads him into a match on Friday for high stakes. If Bradbury loses, he must give Gladstone three railroads, but if he wins, he will get to keep Blizzard. The day of the match, Bradbury arrives at the course and finds Gladstone Bott waiting with two caddies. Bott plays cautiously and steadily while Bradbury is a riskier player. Their scores are the same when they reach the sixteenth hole. Bradbury's ball ends up in a grassy area, in a spot difficult to hit the ball out of. While Bott is not looking, Bradbury gives his caddie a hundred dollars, then moves his ball slightly to a better spot. The caddie says nothing to Gladstone. Bradbury cheats a second time, and bribes his caddie with a hundred and fifty dollars. Bradbury apparently wins the match. The caddie, who is actually a detective paid by Gladstone, then reports that Bradbury cheated. Victory is awarded to Gladstone. Bradbury goes home disappointed and is nervous about telling his wife, Evangeline. She returns to New York and tells Bradbury she has done something awful. She took on Vosper, the extremely impressive butler of a Duke, as their new butler. Vosper came to America on the same ship. She does not know what to do since she hasn't the nerve to fire Blizzard. Bradbury, secretly relieved, says he will try to get Gladstone to engage Blizzard. =\\"Keeping in with Vosper\\"= * UK: Strand, March 1926 * US: Liberty, 13 March 1926 ;Plot While a young man at the club must wait for his wife while she telephones her dress-maker, the Oldest Member tells him another story about American millionaire Bradbury Fisher. Bradbury employs a dignified English butler named Hildebrand Vosper, who previously worked in the prestigious household of a duke. Bradbury is pleased that his friend Rupert Worple, who was just released from Sing-Sing, is paying him a visit. However, Bradbury becomes nervous when he learns that his wife's disapproving mother, Mrs Lora Smith Maplebury, is coming. One evening, Vosper tells Bradbury that Mr Worple must go. His laugh is too hearty, and, in the butler's words, it would not have done for the Duke. Bradbury initially resists being bossed by his butler, but Bradbury's wife insists he do as Vosper says so Vosper does not resign. Bradbury reluctantly tells Rupert to leave. After Rupert has left, Mrs Maplebury arrives. To make matters worse for Bradbury, his wife is going to take up golf again and play with him every day. Vosper suggested it for exercise. Bradbury is now even more annoyed with Vosper, because his wife is an excruciatingly slow golfer. She also has little respect for the usual etiquette and rules of the club. She brings her pet dog to the course, does not replace divots, and speaks lightly of the Green Committee. Bradbury is unwilling to play golf with her any longer. He claims he has business in the City, but actually goes to another golf course. Mrs Maplebury tells her daughter she does not believe Bradbury and suspects he is having an affair. Bradbury qualifies for the sixth sixteen in the annual invitation tournament of his new club. Vosper says he does not want to work for someone engaged in commerce, so Bradbury cannot pretend to go to the office anymore. He notices an announcement about the inauguration of a new football stadium at Sing-Sing, and pretends he must join his old friends at the event. He actually goes to the tournament, and wins a small pewter cup. He returns to the house in a cheerful mood and doubles Vosper's wages. Bradbury claims he saw a football game, but Mrs Fisher knows this is a lie, having read that the stadium inauguration was postponed. Bradbury admits he was playing golf. Mrs Fisher is glad to hear this, and forgives him. She will not play golf again because Vosper saw how she played one morning and told her respectfully that she must stop. Bradbury is pleased and trebles Vosper's salary. Vosper says that Mrs Maplebury must leave, noting that the Duke would not have approved of her. Bradbury is thrilled and quadruples Vosper's salary. =\\"Chester Forgets Himself\\"= * UK: Strand, May 1924 * US: Saturday Evening Post, 7 July 1923 ;Plot The Oldest Member remarks that members of the clergy should be given more lenient handicaps, because they bear the strain of not being able to swear. He recounts the following story of a man named Chester Meredith, whose happiness was nearly ruined because he tried to contain himself in this respect. Chester complains to the Oldest Member about The Wrecking Crew, a slow foursome that don't let other golfers pass them. A beautiful woman walks by, and Chester is instantly smitten with her. The knowledgable Oldest Member tells him she is Felicia Blakeney, and has come for a month to visit a friend. Her mother is a well-known novelist, and her brother is an essayist named Crispin. Chester did not get along well with Crispin at school. The Oldest Member suggests that Chester pretend he was good friends with Crispin, who is away in India, to make Felicia like him. The Oldest Member introduces Chester to Felicia as a friend of Crispin. Felicia seems cold and unfriendly, which the Oldest Member thinks is due to Chester's shy stiffness. Chester plays golf with Felicia. He usually swears when he makes mistakes but resists doing so around her. He praises her brother, and her mother's novels, which he secretly hates. Felicia actually dislikes the highbrow nature of her intellectual family and is not fond of her brother Crispin. She respects Chester's skill at golf, but thinks he is too dispassionate on the links. Chester is unaware of this and proposes to Felicia. She turns him down. Disappointed, Chester devotes himself to golf. Two weeks later, Chester has become a very skilled golfer. Felicia agrees to play one last round with him before she leaves. After a bad start, Chester plays very well. Felicia points out that he could beat the lowest course record, sixty-eight. (Peter Willard, from the story \\"A Woman is Only a Woman\\", got the highest record, a hundred and sixty-one.) Chester keeps himself from swearing and remains calm when his ball falls into some undergrowth. His attitude again disappoints Felicia. Chester can still beat the record. When he gets to the eighteenth hole, he has to wait for the Wrecking Crew. Eventually, Chester is able to play a few shots and must hole out in two strokes to break the record. A member of the Wrecking Crew called the First Grave-Digger hits his ball while Chester is bending to make a shot. The ball hits Chester in the seat of his plus-fours, and causes him to hit his ball too short a distance. Chester loudly shouts many swears. He stops when he hears Felicia say his name, and apologizes, but she is glad that he shouted. She realizes he was controlling himself before for her sake. She says she will marry him. The Wrecking Crew apologize to Chester. However, he still has one more shot to break the record, and he succeeds. Felicia and Chester admit they both dislike Crispin, and happily wander off into the sunset. =\\"The Magic Plus Fours\\"= * UK: Strand, December 1922 * US: Red Book, January 1923 (as \\"The Plus Fours\\") ;Plot The Oldest Member remarks that someone can become arrogant if they become good at golf too quickly, and tells the related story of Wallace Chesney. Wallace Chesney, a nice and modest young man, does not play golf well but is an enthusiastic player. He and his fianc√©e Charlotte Dix are a happy couple. Wallace lacks confidence in golf and thinks he can overcome this by acquiring the right golf club. He goes to the Cohen Bros. second-hand shop, where the Cohen brothers, a purposeful bunch eager to make a sale, sell Wallace multiple goods in addition to a putter with a unique design. They also show him a pair of vivid, prismatic plus fours. Wallace is initially shocked by the garment's bright appearance, but when he tries them on, he feels a surge of confidence. He buys them and wears them to the club. His friends and Charlotte immediately object to the plus fours. However, Charlotte acknowledges that they have improved Wallace's game tremendously after they play a match. Wallace continues to improve in golf, and becomes conceited and unpopular. After playing with Wallace, Raymond Gandle complains to the Oldest Member about Wallace's new superior attitude, and mentions that Charlotte broke off their engagement. Concerned, the Oldest Member goes to talk to Charlotte. She will not return to Wallace unless he becomes his old self again. The Oldest Member next visits Wallace, who claims that Charlotte's handicap is too high at 14, though the Oldest Member observes that Wallace is not truly happy. Wallace says he is bored because he is too good at golf, and everyone else is jealous of him. During the club's July competition, many spectators watch as Wallace plays a match against Peter Willard, an untalented but amiable player. During their match, Wallace plays excellently, smokes his pipe, and treats Peter as his inferior. While they are playing a hole with a lake, Peter smacks Wallace to hit a wasp, which annoys Wallace. Peter then tries to tell Wallace something, but Wallace won't listen. A moment later, he realizes he is on fire. It started because Peter inadvertently hit the match- box for Wallace's pipe when killing the wasp. Peter suggests that Wallace jump in the lake, and he does so. The plus fours are charred and ruined, so a caddie fetches Wallace's grey flannel trousers. Wallace changes behind a group of male spectators. Without the plus fours, he begins to feel uncertain of himself like he used to. When he resumes playing golf, he makes mistakes and hits his balls into the lake. Peter does the same. They sympathize with each other, and the spectators are cheerfully amused. Wallace is happy and feels that golf is fun again. Charlotte Dix, one of the spectators, is pleased that Wallace is back to normal. =\\"The Awakening of Rollo Podmarsh\\"= * UK: Strand, January 1923 * US: Red Book, March 1923 (as \\"Rollo Podmarsh Comes To\\") ;Plot The Oldest Member disapproves of the club's new bowling green. A young man says the game of bowls was good enough for Francis Drake, who chose to finish a game of bowls even when the Spanish Armada was in sight. The Oldest Member tells the story of a similar case in the history of golf. Diffident, 28-year-old Rollo Podmarsh was raised to be overly health-conscious by his mother. He wears extra layers of clothes and regularly eats a bowl of hot arrowroot for his health. Mary Kent, the daughter of an old friend of Rollo's mother, comes to stay while her parents are abroad. Like Rollo, she plays golf. Rollo falls in love with Mary right away, while she thinks he is too health-conscious. Her opinion of him improves after he smokes a pipe, in an attempt to get better at golf by imitating Ted Ray, though this alarms his mother. One evening, Rollo asks Mary what kind of man she would fall in love with. She answers that she could only love a brave man who did something heroic. Rollo is concerned about this, and also about his golf. He hopes to finish the course in under a hundred strokes, but always scores one hundred and twenty. He starts to lose his appetite. Lettice Willoughby, his very young niece, remembers that her family's dog, Ponto, lost his appetite not long before he had to be put out of his misery because he was very old and ill. Rollo tells Lettice he feels old and miserable. However, he feels better later when Mary asks him to play golf with her. Mary is a better golfer than Rollo and encourages him to reach his goal. He appreciates this and quietly says her name to himself. The syllables happen to coincide with the correct form and timing for the shot, and he hits the ball perfectly. Bolstered by Mary's encouragement, he gets through the first half of the course in forty-six strokes. While Jane is not there, Rollo's sister, Enid Willoughby, comes and tells Rollo that Lettice wrote to her about putting Rollo out of his misery. Enid does not take this seriously, but Rollo does, since his arrowroot tasted odd the last few evenings. He believes Lettice poisoned it, though Enid thinks the idea is absurd. Rollo thinks he is unlikely to do the first nine holes in forty-six again, so despite his nervousness about his health, he resumes playing. He gets a score of ninety-seven. Rollo then tells Mary he has been poisoned, and that her he loves her. Mary thinks Rollo is heroic, and they get engaged. Enid returns and repeats that Rollo's concerns were nonsense. She talked to Letty, who gave up when the chemist wouldn't sell her poison. The arrowroot only tasted strange because Mrs Podmarsh put something in it meant to break a smoking habit. Rollo is overjoyed. He stops taking arrowroot and worrying over his health. =\\"Rodney Fails to Qualify\\"= * UK: Strand, March 1924 * US: Saturday Evening Post, 23 February 1924 ;Plot The Oldest Member thinks a golfer should think twice before marrying a non-golfer and tells the club secretary the following story. Jane Packard and William Bates are not officially engaged, but they grew up together and there is a sort of understanding between them that they will get married someday. William, a large, slow-moving man, sends her gifts months apart, and Jane, also an athletic and slow-moving person, does not mind a slow courtship. They play golf together every day and have similar handicaps. One day, the Oldest Member notices that Jane seems discontent. She read a passionate romance novel and wants her life to be more romantic. The Oldest Member goes to William's cottage and tells him to propose to Jane and be passionate. William decides to do so at the sixth hole on the golf course. At the course, The Oldest Member sees Jane with a romantic-looking young man named Rodney Spelvin who has come to stay for a while at a house nearby. Rodney is a poet, and Jane admires his poetry. William cannot propose to her with Rodney around. Later, the Oldest Member warns William that Jane is romantic and may be drawn away by a fascinating stranger like Rodney. William doubts Jane would fall in love with a poet who doesn't play golf. Around a week later, William proposes to Jane in a simple unpoetic way. She turns him down, saying that she loves Rodney. The Oldest Member tries to tell Jane to reconsider William's proposal. However, Rodney proposed to her, much more poetically than William did, and they got engaged. William still cares for Jane and caddies for her during the Ladies' Invitation Tournament at Mossy Heath. She becomes annoyed by Rodney for humming while she addresses her ball and for not noticing her good shots. She hits one of her balls into a waist-high river. She takes a penalty and hits another ball, but this one also ends up in the water. William suggests she play that ball from where it floats. There is a boat, which William will row. Jane asks Rodney to steer. He does so, though he is more interested in talking poetically about nature than in Jane's golf. Standing on the boat, Jane tries to hit the drifting ball, sending water spraying over Rodney, irritating him. She misses the ball and repeatedly tries again, while her opponent patiently reads a book. When Rodney tries to leave the boat while Jane is swinging her niblick, the boat overturns. Jane's bag of clubs sinks to the bottom of the stream. She tells Rodney to find it. Rodney has had enough and leaves. William retrieves Jane's clubs for her. Jane loves William and will marry him. She returns to trying to hit the ball out of the stream with encouragement from William. =\\"Jane Gets off the Fairway\\"= * UK: Strand, November 1924 * US: Saturday Evening Post, 25 October 1924 ;Plot The Oldest Member is inspired by white violets in the club secretary's buttonhole to tell another story about William, Jane, and Rodney. William Bates marries Jane. The Oldest Member warns William not to forget his anniversary, since Jane is romantic. William knows she likes white violets because Rodney used to get them for her. William has paid a florist to send white violets to Jane on their anniversary for five years, and thinks the violets will remind him. Jane and William frequently play golf together and are a happy couple. However, Jane becomes worried that he will forget their first anniversary. When the day comes, William says nothing about it. While in their garden, Jane sees a postman deliver a cardboard box with white violets. There is no message with the flowers. Jane thinks that Rodney sent the flowers, as a way of saying that, though all was over between them, he had not forgotten her. Jane is loyal to William but touched nonetheless, and puts the violets in her room. The same thing occurs on their next four anniversaries. Shortly after the fifth anniversary, when their son Braid Vardon Bates (named after golfers James Braid and Harry Vardon) is four years old, a novel by Rodney is published. The novel becomes popular, especially after it is denounced by a group of mothers and members of the clergy. The Oldest Member finds it pretentious, but Jane adores the book. One day, Jane runs into Rodney. Rodney does not remember her at first but eventually recalls that they were once engaged. He pretends he based the heroine of his novel on her, which moves Jane. She becomes dissatisfied with William's lack of romance. She tells William she feels stifled and wants to live in a studio in town. They move into a studio in the city. Jane gives parties for artists and intellectuals, including Rodney. William dislikes this and says he will go back to their old place if she keeps having Rodney around. She says she will not be kept from seeing an old friend. William leaves and focuses on playing golf, but he misses playing with Jane. He receives a letter from the florists, asking if he wishes to renew his five-year order. William now remembers he sent flowers and goes to see Jane. Meanwhile, Jane misses William and is not fascinated by her new friends or Rodney anymore. She sees little Braid Vardon holding William's spare mashie incorrectly and realizes that she has been neglecting her son's golf education. A female neighbour mentions to Jane that Rodney tells every girl he meets that they are the model for his novel's heroine. William comes and asks if he can keep sending her white violets even though they are living separate lives. Jane is surprised that William sent the violets and apologizes. They reconcile and go back to their old cottage together with their son. =\\"The Purification of Rodney Spelvin\\"= * UK: Strand, September 1925 * US: Saturday Evening Post, 22 August 1925 This story follows \\"Rodney Fails to Qualify\\" and \\"Jane Gets off the Fairway\\", and is followed by \\"Rodney Has a Relapse\\" (collected in Nothing Serious). ;Plot The Oldest Member tells the club secretary a third story involving William Bates, his wife Jane Bates, and Jane's ex-fianc√© Rodney Spelvin. Jane and William have been married seven years, and their son, Braid Vardon Bates, is six years old. Jane invited William's sister Anastatia, an expert golfer and talented teacher, to visit and help teach their son golf. Anastatia tells Jane she loves a man named Rodney Spelvin. This concerns Jane, who does not trust Rodney. After seeing a film in which the heroine goes at night to the apartments of a libertine to beg him to spare her sister, Jane plans to secretly go to Rodney and tell him to leave Anastatia alone. She hopes to use his past affection for her to get him to agree. She telephones Rodney to have lunch with him. Rodney somehow seems nobler than before. They have lunch, but the conversation is difficult since he hardly remembers her. William sees them having lunch and knows Jane is lying when she says she had lunch at the club. William starts avoiding Jane. She realizes he suspects something, but she is reluctant to tell him the truth, since he would tell Anastatia not to see Rodney, and Anastatia would be offended and stop teaching their son. Rodney telephones the house, and Jane answers it, pretending to be Anastatia. Rodney asks her to come to his house the next day and says they will be alone. Jane is scandalized and more determined than ever to end Anastatia's association with him. The next day, Jane goes to Rodney's house to confront him. She is not worried since she is athletic while Rodney is not, and she could beat him in a fight. William suddenly appears, along with two detectives in bowler hats. William listened to the telephone conversation between Jane and Rodney, and thinks they are having an affair. Jane explains that she came to save Anastatia, who is infatuated with Rodney. They hear Rodney and Anastatia coming, and hide. They all overhear Rodney say things to her that seem suggestive, but when they leave their hiding spots, they see Anastatia is actually just giving Rodney a golf lesson. Rodney says he is too much a sensitive artist to takes lessons in public, so he is taking private lessons at home. William asks Rodney if he has proposed to Anastasia. Rodney is shocked at the idea. He admits he loves her but he does not feel worthy of her. Anastasia is delighted and confesses her feelings for Rodney. They get married and take a cottage near that of William and Jane. In golf, they are well-matched as couples, since Jane and William have handicaps of ten, while Anastatia and Rodney have handicaps of zero and eighteen, respectively.

(alternatively spelled Conbrio or ConBrio) was a short-lived but influential synthesizer manufacturing company which, from 1978 to 1982, produced its most famous (and only) product, the ADS (an acronym for Advanced Digital Synthesizer).  Early history and the ADS 100  Con Brio was founded in Pasadena, California, around 1979 by Tim Ryan, Alan Danziger, and Don Lieberman, three California Institute of Technology students who originally studied audio synthesis equipment designed to map the cerebral cortex of cats. Their first prototype was a modular production station dubbed the ADS 100. Originally designed as a tone generator to test hearing, the ADS was innovative in its approach to synthesis, and was, in fact, one of the earliest digital synthesizers. It was capable of several types of synthesis, including additive synthesis, phase modulation synthesis, and frequency modulation synthesis (commonly abbreviated to FM). It used three 6502 processors (the same processor used in the Apple II computer and Commodore 64) and included a video monitor which displayed sequences and envelope parameters. It could also be upgraded with commonly available computer peripherals, including an 8-inch floppy disk drive. All of this was controlled via a brightly colored control panel and two 61-note keyboards. The ADS 100 was later famously used to generate sound effects for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979) and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (1982). Although Con Brio used this aggressively to market their product, no price for the ADS was given at the time, and the ADS 100 was largely assumed to be commercially unavailable.  ADS 200  The ADS 100 was later modified and rebuilt to produce the ADS 200. This incarnation of the ADS series was an all-in-one machine, similar to the PPG Realizer, and weighed approximately 175 pounds. All components were built into a large wooden box, and several features were added, including the ability to display musical notation and splittable keyboards. The sequencer also could sync and play up to four tracks at a time, and five 6502 processors were used, as opposed to only three on the 100. The ADS 200 also implemented CV/Gate, an interfacing system that was standard before the invention of MIDI. The ADS 200 was completely hand-wired and reportedly took over seven months to build. Of the two units built, only one was reportedly sold for approximately $30,000 (about ¬£17,000), making the ADS 200 a relative success. The buyer was film composer David Campell, Beck's father, who also arranged music for Tori Amos, Elton John, The Rolling Stones, Kiss, Aerosmith, and films, such as Brokeback Mountain. It was reportedly kept in friend Chick Corea's studio for several years before being acquired by musician and noted aficionado of vintage synthesizer gear Brian Kehew.  Legal troubles and the ADS 200-R  By 1981, Yamaha began to take notice of Con Brio's use of FM synthesis, on which they owned a patent (although the legality of the patent was in doubt, as FM synthesis had been used commonly for many years before Yamaha's claim). Because the ADS 200 used FM synthesis extensively, Yamaha warned Con Brio that royalties would be requested if any more ADS units were sold. Con Brio replied that because their device was completely configurable, they did not have control over whether or not the device was used as an FM synthesizer. Although Con Brio continued to violate Yamaha's patent, legal action was never taken, presumably because Con Brio was never successful enough to become a major competitor. Yamaha would later implement FM synthesis with their wildly successful DX7 synthesizer. In 1982, Con Brio introduced the ADS 200-R, a three-piece, detached double-keyboard model that was marketed toward touring musicians as being \\"roadable.\\" It featured a 16-track polyphonic sequencer capable of storing 80,000 notes. At US$20,500 (about GBP¬£11,500), with an additional US$25,000 (about GBP¬£14,200) of options available, the 200-R was significantly less expensive than the original 200. However, the one unit that was built failed to sell. Although Con Brio considered retooling it into a sampling workstation similar to the Fairlight CMI, the cost of their operation and pressure from cheaper synthesizers and larger manufacturers forced the company to go out of business later that year before their vision was able to be realized.  Aftermath  In the years since Con Brio's demise, Danziger and Lieberman have become successful manufacturing semiconductors. Tim Ryan, motivated to continue manufacturing music equipment, cofounded The Sonus corporation, which later became M-Audio, a leading manufacturer of computer audio interfaces, MIDI controller keyboards, and studio monitor speakers. The one Con Brio ADS 200 that was ever sold now belongs to Brian Kehew of The Moog Cookbook. He claims that it was originally the ADS 100 and that it was retooled as the 200. In the years he has owned it, some functions have ceased to work, including the floppy drive. This is underway to be repaired. In researching the repair of the ADS 200, Kehew also obtained the final Con Brio made, the ADS 200-R machine. In February 2009, the ADS 200R was restored to nearly full operation.

Biography =Early life and studies= Tattarescu was born in Foc≈üani in 1818. He began as an apprentice to his uncle Nicolae Teodorescu, a church painter. He studied at the Painting School from BuzƒÉu, when Teodorescu moved there. The Orthodox Bishop of BuzƒÉu, Chesarie, helped him obtain a scholarship in Rome, where he was taught by professors from the Accademia di San Luca. While there, Tattarescu made copies of paintings by Raphael, Bartolom√© Est√©ban Murillo, Salvatore Rosa, and Guido Reni. =Political activities= Portrait of Nicolae BƒÉlcescu (1851) February 11th, 1866 - The Modern Romania Tattarescu was a participant in the 1848 Revolution in Wallachia. After the revolution, he painted portraits of Romanian revolutionaries in exile such as Gheorghe Magheru, ≈ûtefan Golescu, and, in 1851, that of Nicolae BƒÉlcescu (in three almost identical versions). Romantic nationalist ideals were the inspiration for his allegorical compositions with revolutionary themes in Romania's rebirth (1849), the patriotic Principalities' Unification (1857) and February 11 - The Modern Romania (1866).Voinescu, p. 46-47 =Later life and legacy= In 1860, being commissioned to draw up a National Album of sights and historical monuments of the country, his talent of painting vaguely Romantic landscapes became highly valued. At the same time, showing his sympathy with various peasant uprisings, he painted The peasant at the Danube in 1875. He was also commissioned to decorate several churches in a neoclassical manner. In 1864, together with painter Theodor Aman, Tattarescu founded the National School of Fine Arts in Bucharest; he was a professor there for a long time after, and served as the School's headmaster for two years (1891‚Äì1892). In 1865, he wrote Useful Principles and Studies on Proportions of the Human Body and Drawing after the Most Famous Painters. Tattarescu died in Bucharest. The house he bought in 1855 and lived in for almost 40 years is now home to the Gheorghe Tattarescu Memorial Museum. It was opened 1951, and hosts several of his original works of art.

He was a prominent member of the \\"Investigating Sex\\" group of Surrealist thinkers. In politics, he was a Communist and then a Trotskyist, before joining the PSU. He led a career as an occupational sociologist. Early life Naville was born in 1903 in Paris, to a family of Swiss Protestant bankers. Surrealist from its earliest times In 1922 he founded the avant- garde periodical L'≈ìuf dur (The Tough Egg) together with Philippe Soupault, Fran√ßois G√©rard, Max Jacob, Louis Aragon and Blaise Cendrars. He was co-editor with Benjamin P√©ret for the three first numbers of La R√©volution Surr√©aliste, founded the Bureau de Recherches Surr√©alistes in (1924 and participated in surrealist activities with Andr√© Breton before eventually opposing Surrealism because of his political divergences from the emerging Surrealist orthodoxy. Politics In 1926, Naville joined the French Communist Party (PCF), for which he managed the publication Clart√©. He was a member of a delegation that visited Leon Trotsky in Moscow in 1927. He returned convinced by Trotsky's arguments and was expelled from the Communist Party in 1928 for deviationism. From this point onwards, he participated in the life of the French Trotskyist extreme left and notably its publications. However, he became less and less convinced by Trotsky's position, and broke with the group in 1939. He then organised attempts to create a Marxist left, devoid of Communist and Trotskyist trappings, through a publication called the Revue Internationale. Initially passing through the PSU, Naville continued to search for a modern left in the PSG, then the UGS, before taking part in the re-establishment of the Parti Socialiste Unifi√© (PSU) under the Fifth Republic. He remained loyal to this party in spite of his opposition to the \\"realists\\" (Gilles Martinet, Michel Rocard) and showed total rejection of Fran√ßois Mitterrand. Psycho- sociology of work Appointed director of research at the CNRS in 1947, he worked with Georges Friedmann at the Centre d'√©tudes sociologiques, dedicating his work to the psychosociology of work, and the study of automation, industrial society, the psychology of comportment, and the strategists and theoreticians of war, notably Carl von Clausewitz. He supervised the French translation and publication of the complete works of Clausewitz. Existentialism He was the primary other contributor mentioned at the end of Jean-Paul Sartre's L'existentialisme est un humanisme (Existentialism is a Humanism), criticising existentialism.

After drawing editorial cartoons while at West High School in Torrance, California, Staake attended the University of Southern California (1977) on a journalism/international relations scholarship. He interned at the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial's Students Press Law Center. Cartoons and illustration Artwork by Staake has been published in the Chicago Tribune, Easy Reader, the Los Angeles Times, the Miami Herald, The New York Times, Sports Illustrated Kids, Time, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal. His illustrations have appeared in advertising for numerous companies, including American Express, the Cartoon Network, Dr Pepper, Hallmark Cards, Kenner Toys, McDonald's, Nickelodeon, Ralston Purina, Sony and United Airlines. Starting in 1993, Staake contributed concepts and cartoons to \\"The Style Invitational\\", a humor competition at The Washington Post. In 1995, he became a regular contributor to Mad. He created many covers for The New Yorker, beginning with the September 4, 2006 issue. Staake is noted for using vintage software to create his illustrations. He currently uses Adobe Photoshop 3.0 on Classic in Mac OS X. Books Staake began as a book illustrator in 1992 when he contributed to Jay Leno's Headlines (Warner Books). In 1998, he wrote and illustrated his first book for children, My Little 1 2 3 Book (Little Simon), a 26-page board book. He followed with numerous books for children, including The Red Lemon, named by The New York Times as one of the ten best illustrated children's books of 2006. In The Complete Book of Caricature (North Light Books, 1991). Staake explained how a subject's personality is incorporated into a drawing and provided reference materials, along with samples of caricaturists, including David Levine, Mort Drucker and Ralph Steadman. In 1990, 1991 and 1993, Staake wrote and co-edited the Humor and Cartoon Markets series of resource books listing magazines, newsletters, greeting card companies and other publishers who purchase humorous illustrations. In 1996, for The Complete Book of Humorous Art (North Light), he interviewed 20 illustrators, including Gary Baseman, Lou Brooks and Elwood Smith. In September 2016 Bob Staake released under the pseudonym Arthur Gackley a book of children's book covers for adults entitled Bad Little Children's Books. Three months after release blogger Kelly Jensen at Book Riot critiqued the humor book for propagating racist stereotypes. The subsequent online outcry led Staake to request that his publisher, Abrams Books, cease printing the book. The National Coalition Against Censorship, whose Board of Directors currently includes Abrams president and CEO Michael Jacobs, issued a statement in support of the book: ‚ÄúWe support Abrams‚Äô decision to publish this, or any other book, even if it offends some readers. We urge the company not to accede to pressure to withdraw the book, but to stand for the proposition that it is the right of authors to write as they choose and of individuals to decide for themselves what to read.‚Äù Abrams clarified in a statement that they were only ceasing future printings of the book in order to honor the author's request and would not otherwise have intervened.

It is found in the southeastern United States near swamps, rocky uplands, and pine woods. It migrates to the West Indies, Central America, and northwestern South America. Taxonomy This bird is generally confused with the better-known whippoorwill (Antrostomus vociferus),For example, Henninger (1906) combines the old scientific name of C. carolinensis with the common name \\"Whip-poor-will\\". As C. carolinensis does not occur in the area discussed, he obviously refers to C. vociferus. In other cases, the specific identity of birds may not be determinable. because of their similar calls and unusual names. Though rather closely related, they are two distinct species. Description The chuck-will's-widow has a short bill and a long tail typical of the nightjars. It has mottled brownish underparts, a buff throat, reddish-brown feathers lined with black, and brown and white patterning on head and chest. Males have patches of white on their outer tail feathers.

Hendrik de Cock protested against the perceived theological liberalism in the Netherlands government controlled Dutch Reformed Church in the 18th century. This protest led to the Secession (Afscheiding) of 1834. He is sometimes called the father of the Secession of 1834. Early life Hendrik de Cock was born in the city of Veendam, Groningen, the Netherlands on 12 April 1801 to father Regnerius Tjaarda de Cock and mother Jantje Kappen. His grandfather Regnerus Tjaarda de Cock was a minister in the Dutch Reformed Church around 1750. His parents were associated with the Dutch Reformed Church. Shortly after de Cock's birth his family moved to Wildervank, Groningen. In 1824 he married Frouwe Venema (b 1803 - d 1889). Education He entered into the University of Groningen to study to become a minister of theology. In 1823 he graduated from this university. He was called to the congregation of Eppenhuizen, Groningen and (shortly after his marriage in 1824) was ordained there as a Minister. He would serve this congregation for three years until in 1827 he became Minister in Noordlaren, Groningen for two years. History In 1829, Hendrik de Cock (who is also known as the father of the Secession) became minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in the town of Ulrum, near the city of Groningen. He was not evangelical but his congregation was. One of the members gave him the Canons of Dordt to read. This, plus his own discovery of John Calvin's Institutes of the Christian Religion, led to a great change in his preaching. This change in his preaching attracted many people from other congregations to his worship services. Later these same people requested Hendrik de Cock to baptize their new babies. They could not, in good conscience have their babies baptized in their own churches, partly because the old Baptism Form had been replaced with, in their view, other heretical practices and liturgy, and partly because if the old Form was still used they could not answer \\"Yes\\" to the question whether they \\"believed the doctrine taught in their church was the truth of God's Word\\". After careful consideration, consultation with his consistory and others, and through anxious prayer, De Cock did baptize these children. This infuriated the clergy from the other congregations, who in turn notified the authorities. It was, in fact, this issue that De Cock's colleagues brought in protest against him at Classis. In his defense he wrote a pamphlet defending what he and his consistory believed to be the truth. This sparked off much debate and as a result the Dutch Reformed Church suspended him as a minister on 13 December 1833. > in order to maintain law and order in the Reformed Church, to protect the > name and honour of the ministers of the Gospel, and to prevent more > disorders, divisions, and revolutions in several congregations in our > Fatherland; . . . if preachers as DeCock were not halted in their reckless > enterprise, this Board fears the worst. Hendrik de Cock submitted to his suspension and stayed off his pulpit, but tensions continued to rise. They reached a kind of climax when Rev. Heinrich Scholte (later to settle and establish a colony in Pella, Iowa), who was known to be friendly to him, was forbidden to preach in Hendrik de Cock's church. In this way, a modernist could occupy the pulpit instead. The congregation did not take kindly to this and the police were called in to prevent what was a near riot. Hendrik de Cock refused to recant, and finally, with his congregation, officially parted (seceded) on 13 October 1834 from the Dutch Reformed Church. The next day they signed the Act of Secession or Return (1834). The first two years under de Cock saw the formation of over 200 churches that quickly developed out of local Bible studies called, \\"oefeningen,\\" with a leader who served as the \\"oefenaar,\\" that were meeting in homes. Here believers had been reading together from the \\"Old Writers\\" (17th century Further Reformation\\" pastors and theologians) who emphasized not only mindful apprehension of Reformed doctrine but also personal appropriation of these Calvinist truths. Other churches also left the Dutch Reformed Church to join Hendrik de Cock in the Christian Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (CGKN). These churches and their members would be called the \\"Secessionists\\" or \\"Seceders\\". The Secession (Afscheiding) The Dutch Reformed Church and the Dutch government made the Seceders suffer terribly for their convictions. Their meetings were often broken up by mob violence; they were fined and imprisoned. On 25 October 1834 a company infantry (104 soldiers) were sent by the Dutch government to Ulrum and to other places where the Seceders had established separate congregations and were billeted in the homes of the seceders. These people were usually rather poor, which also why the other clergymen held them in contempt; yet they were forced to feed and shelter the soldiers, tend to their needs, and live their lives with the soldiers always present. The soldiers stayed there until the end of January 1835, and even then, half of them remained until 7 July 1835. As a counter-measure to the Secession, the Dutch government reinstated an old French law from the time of Napoleon, that forbade any assembly of more than 20 people. This made it difficult, if not impossible, for the Seceders to gather to worship. If any regulations imposed on them were broken, they were fined vast sums of money. And if they were unable to pay the fines, their possessions were sold in Sheriff's sales and the proceeds paid to the government. If even this did not suffice, they would be imprisoned. Hendrik de Cock himself was fined 150 florin (guilders) and spent three months in prison, separated from wife and family. Not until under King William II in 1841 would this counter-measure and the religious persecution end. Later years In 1837 Hendrik de Cock was called to the city of Groningen to be minister of the Reformed Church (Gereformeerde Kerk) there. He would serve this congregation until his death. He died from a lung disease at the age of 41, on 14 November 1842. He is buried in Groningen at the Southern Cemetery (Zuiderbegraafplaats) in a well marked (and maintained) grave. He was survived by his wife and five children, three of whom were very young. De Cock's grave stone was erected in 1891 (two years after his wife died) and renewed in 1911. The known names of his children are Helenius de Cock (son), Eelbrina de Cock (daughter) and Jantje de Cock (daughter) (born 20 January 1836).

Prior to becoming a sportscaster, James was a professional football player for the New England Patriots of the National Football League and for the Washington Federals of the United States Football League. He ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in Texas in 2012, but was defeated in the first round of the Republican primary. Early life James was born in Jacksonville, Texas, in 1961 and grew up in the Houston, Texas area. When he was in the first grade, his parents divorced and he moved with his mother and brother (former Major League Baseball player Chris James) to Pasadena, Texas. James has talked about growing up witnessing his mother being abused and struggling financially to support her sons. James attended Stratford High School in Houston, where he was a star running back on their 1978 Texas class 4A championship football team, setting the single- season Texas 4A rushing record with 2,411 yards gained in 15 games. James also played on his high school baseball team and was offered a contract by the New York Yankees out of high school to play first base in the minor leagues, but chose to pursue a football career instead. College James was heavily recruited out of high school and decided to attend Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. James stated that he decided on SMU because his girlfriend at the time (and future wife), Marilyn, was already a freshman student there. Parade's national high school running back of the year, Eric Dickerson, as well as a large number of blue-chip recruits, also signed with SMU in 1979. The star running back tandem was to become known as \\"The Pony Express\\", and the tandem would alternate possessions throughout their four- year careers at SMU. In his freshman year in 1979, James proved more reliable than Dickerson, outgaining him 761 yards to 477, and was named the Southwest Conference's Offensive Newcomer of the Year. In the 1980 Holiday Bowl (later known as the \\"Miracle Bowl\\"), James' offensive production of 225 rushing yards and 9.9 yards/carry were not enough as SMU lost the Holiday Bowl, though he set records that stood for 13 and 15 years respectively. By 1982, while the pair continued to alternate possessions at tailback, Dickerson had established himself as the featured back as he carried 232 times for 1,617 yards compared to James running 197 times for 938 yards. James found other ways to contribute to the team as he took over punting duties midway through the year after the regular punter was injured, and finished sixth in the nation in punting. That year, he also scored on a 96-yard touchdown reception to set a new record as the longest scoring play in Southwest Conference history. James played on the 1981 SMU team that won the Southwest Conference title while being on NCAA probation as a result of recruiting violations dating back to the mid-1970s. In later years, SMU was further caught up in the Southern Methodist University football scandal, which involved payments to players in the 1983 recruiting class, with such payments improperly continuing while SMU was again on probation in 1985 and 1986. As a result of the repeated violations, SMU received the \\"death penalty\\" from the NCAA, shutting down the program in 1987 and 1988. Neither James' recruitment nor his participation in the SMU football program were cited by the NCAA in levying sanctions against SMU. In 2012, James admitted to having received what he called \\"an insignificant amount\\" of improper gifts while playing at SMU. He has always denied that improper financial inducements had anything to do with his decision to attend SMU. Professional football career =Washington Federals (USFL)= After his senior season, James was drafted by the Washington Federals of the USFL with the fourth overall pick in the spring league's inaugural draft in 1983. James signed with the Federals to a series of four guaranteed 1-year deals. He stated that he decided to join the USFL rather than the NFL because of a desire to be a \\"pioneer\\" to a new league, similar to what he and Dickerson did at SMU. Despite already being signed to the Federals, the New England Patriots, who were coached by James' former SMU coach Ron Meyer, drafted the rights to James in the 7th round of the 1983 NFL Draft. His first pro season in Washington saw James and the Feds struggle to a 4‚Äì10 record. He started all 14 games and rushed for 823 yards and 4 touchdowns. He also caught 40 passes out of the backfield that season. The following year, 1984, James suffered a knee injury on March 4, in a game at RFK against the Philadelphia Stars. He was placed on injured reserve later that week. He was released by the cash- strapped Federals a month later, allowing him to join the Patriots for their training camp in August that year.\\"Craig James\\", latimes.com, October 6, 1985. =New England Patriots (NFL)= In his first year with the Patriots in the 1984-85 season, he was initially a backup to Tony Collins under his old coach Meyer. When Meyer was fired after a 5‚Äì3 start to the season, new coach Raymond Berry made James the starting running back and he finished the year as the Patriots' leading rusher with 790 yards.\\"Patriots' Craig James Proves He's Not Slow, After All\\", google.com. Craig James (left) rushes the ball past the Dolphins' defense in the 1985‚Äì86 AFC Championship game. In the 1985-86 season, James started at running back all season and rushed for 1,227 yards and was selected for the Pro Bowl. He was the last white player to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season until Peyton Hillis reached that mark in 2010. In week 2 against the Chicago Bears he caught a 90-yard touchdown pass from Tony Eason which was the longest touchdown from scrimmage in Patriots history at the time. He was a major factor in the Patriots' 31-14 upset win over the Miami Dolphins in the AFC title game, rushing for a career postseason high of 105 yards. However, he was dominated by the Chicago Bears' defense in Super Bowl XX, which held him to only 1 yard on 5 carries. James struggled to continue his Pro Bowl form in the 1986-87 season, finishing with just 427 yards on 154 carries. At the end of the year, he had surgery to repair his right shoulder after suffering from recurrent dislocations during the year.google.com. James returned for the start of the 1987-88 season, but got just got 3 carries in the first 2 games of the year before he was shut down with another shoulder injury.\\"Pats' Mistakes, Injuries Doomed Bright Outlook\\" Bangor Daily News - Dec 30, 1987, via google.com. After gaining 15 yards on four carries and 14 catches for 171 yards in the first six games of the 1988-89 season, James suffered from posterior shoulder dislocations and underwent surgery in October, missing the remainder of the season.\\"Craig James underwent surgery on both shoulders and will be out the remainder of the season\\", orlandosentinel.com, October 26, 1988. James retired from the NFL after the 1988 season, having rushed for 2,469 yards and eleven touchdowns in his five seasons with the Patriots. He also had 819 receiving yards and two touchdown catches, and completed three of six pass attempts, with all three completions going for touchdowns. Radio and television career After his retirement from play in 1989, James went on to become a radio analyst for SMU college football games, then the sports anchor for KDFW-TV. During this time, he also appeared on ESPN as a studio analyst on the College GameDay and College Football Scoreboard programs. James worked the Game Day Desk with Lee Corso and would pick up the nickname Mustang Breath from Lee in the 'Not So Fast' segment on their pick 'em segment. In 1996, he joined CBS, where he served as a studio analyst on College Football Today as well as The NFL Today programs before becoming a game analyst on NFL on CBS. During his CBS stint, he served as a reporter during the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship as well as the 1998 Winter Olympics. In 2003, James moved to ABC. He served as a studio analyst on their college football coverage through the 2008 season. James also appears as an analyst on ESPN's Thursday night package as well as other college football programs such as College Football Live. He then teamed with Mike Patrick and sideline reporter Heather Cox as game analyst for the 2009 season, working ESPN on ABC Saturday afternoon broadcasts, while still working the Thursday night package. On December 19, 2011, James announced that he was leaving ESPN to run for the United States Senate. James also operates his own broadcasting school, eponymously called the Craig James School of Broadcasting. James said in 1998 that the Wisconsin Badgers were \\"the worst team to ever play in the Rose Bowl.\\" Wisconsin went on to defeat #6 UCLA 38-31 in the 1999 Rose Bowl. Afterward, Badger coach Barry Alvarez fired back, \\"Well, I know we're at least the second worst.\\" James is a voter in the AP college football poll, and has received some attention and criticism for his reported tendency to give low votes to teams from outside the Automatic Qualifying conferences, such as Boise State and TCU.\\"AP on Craig James' controversial Boise State vote: 'We have no reason to step in'\\" .

Leach allegedly had Adam twice stand in a shed for two hours during practice. James in response had gone directly to the chancellor Kent Hance and members of the board of trustees with his accusations. In light of the allegations, ESPN removed James from announcing the Alamo Bowl, replacing him with Bob Davie. In a lawsuit filed by Leach against Texas Tech, he alleges that Adam \\"voluntarily placed himself into the electrical closet and apparently took pictures with his phone camera.\\" In response, James stated, \\"Since the James family is not a party to the lawsuit, we deem it inappropriate to discuss it.\\" Leach later filed suit against James and others for defamation and wrongful termination related to the publicity surrounding this incident.

A tall man, he was known for batting bare-headed showing his blonde hair. Biography Wiener's mother and father, Bella and Sasha, were Polish and Austrian Jews respectively, and both escaped the concentration camps of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. The surname Wiener came from Vienna, the home of Sasha. His parents married in 1947 in Paris, before coming to Australia as refugees on the famous Dunera ship in 1947. Wiener's father ran a successful textile business, which allowed him to send Wiener to the private Brighton Grammar School. Wiener's father had early sporting success in table tennis, which Wiener applied to his cricket, playing for Prahran in Melbourne grade cricket. He subsequently completed his university education at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in business management, before moving to England to pursue his cricket career. He made a century on his first class debut for Victoria against Queensland in 1977‚Äì78, scoring 106. Two strong seasons, including three further centuries, saw Wiener selected to make is ODI debut as an opening batsman in December 1979 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against England and the West Indies. He struggled, scoring 7 and 27 respectively. Despite this he was selected to make his Test cricket debut against England at the WACA a few days later. He made 11 in the first innings before being run-out while batting with captain Greg Chappell, before scoring 58 in the second innings as Australia won the match. He played in four consecutive tests that summer (two each against England and the West Indies) before being omitted for the final test of the summer. Wiener played in five further ODIs in the Australian season, with his best performances being a 33 and 50 against the West Indies in Sydney in the final two group matches. Averaging only twenty, he was dropped from the ODI team for the finals and ended his ODI career with a slow strike rate of only 42. He was named to tour Pakistan in early 1980, and was recalled to the Test XI for the second and third tests in Faisalabad and Lahore. He made his highest score of 93 in the third test, but that turned out to be the last test of his career, as he was not selected for the national team again. He scored 281 runs at an average of 25.5 in his career. He, along with Jeff Moss had a partnership of 390 at the Junction Oval against Western Australia in 1981‚Äì82.https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/126861735 This still stands as a record for the third wicket for Australians in first-class cricket. Wiener scored an unbeaten 221 in that innings, one of three centuries he produced in the season. Wiener played at the first-class level until retiring at the 1984/85 season, having scored seven centuries in 66 matches. He had also claimed 17 wickets with his off spin, although none of these came at national level. Wiener has worked in the corporate sector since leaving cricket.

The captured images are digitized and stored as a computer file ready for further digital processing, viewing, electronic publishing, or digital printing. Until the advent of such technology, photographs were made by exposing light sensitive photographic film and paper, which was processed in liquid chemical solutions to develop and stabilize the image. Digital photographs are typically created solely by computer-based photoelectric and mechanical techniques, without wet bath chemical processing. The first consumer digital cameras were marketed in the late 1990s. Professionals gravitated to digital slowly, and were won over when their professional work required using digital files to fulfill the demands of employers and/or clients, for faster turn-around than conventional methods would allow. Starting around 2000, digital cameras were incorporated in cell phones and in the following years, cell phone cameras became widespread, particularly due to their connectivity to social media websites and email. Since 2010, the digital point-and-shoot and DSLR formats have also seen competition from the mirrorless digital camera format, which typically provides better image quality than the point-and-shoot or cell phone formats but comes in a smaller size and shape than the typical DSLR. Many mirrorless cameras accept interchangeable lenses and have advanced features through an electronic viewfinder, which replaces the through-the-lens finder image of the SLR format. History While digital photography has only relatively recently become mainstream, the late 20th century saw many small developments leading to its creation. The history of digital photography as we know it began in the 1950s. In 1951, the first digital signals were saved to magnetic tape via the first video tape recorder. Six years later, in 1957, the first digital image was produced through a computer by Russell Kirsch. It was an image of his son. First Digital Image ever created by Russell Kirsch. It is an image of his son Walden The metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) process, invented by engineers Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, led to the development of digital semiconductor image sensors, including the charge-coupled device (CCD) and later the CMOS sensor. The first semiconductor image sensor was the CCD, invented by physicists Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith at Bell Labs in 1969. While researching the MOS process, they realized that an electric charge was the analogy of the magnetic bubble and that it could be stored on a tiny MOS capacitor. As it was fairly straightforward to fabricate a series of MOS capacitors in a row, they connected a suitable voltage to them so that the charge could be stepped along from one to the next. The CCD is a semiconductor circuit that was later used in the first digital video cameras for television broadcasting, and its invention was recognized by a Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. The first image of Mars was taken as the Mariner 4 flew by it on July 15, 1965, with a camera system designed by NASA/JPL. Later, in 1976 the Mars Viking Lander produced digital images from the surface of Mars. While not what we usually define as a digital camera, it used a comparable process. It used a video camera tube, followed by a digitizer, rather than a mosaic of solid state sensor elements. This produced a digital image that was stored on tape for later slow transmission back to Earth.Fred C. Billingsley, \\"Processing Ranger and Mariner Photography,\\" in Computerized Imaging Techniques, Proceedings of SPIE, Vol. 0010, pp. XV-1‚Äì19, January 1967 (August 1965, San Francisco). \\"Mariner is unique in that the pictures were converted to the 6-bit digital form in the spacecraft. The digital signals were transmitted at a very slow rate (8 1/3 bits/sec) and decoded and reformatted in the 7094 computer before being presented to the film recording equipment on computer tape. Thus, there are no digitizing and synchronizing problems, and the operation consists merely of producing the digitally recorded film.\\" The first published color digital photograph was produced in 1972 by Michael Francis Tompsett using CCD sensor technology and was featured on the cover of Electronics Magazine. It was a picture of his wife, Margaret Thompsett. The Cromemco Cyclops, a digital camera developed as a commercial product and interfaced to a microcomputer, was featured in the February 1975 issue of Popular Electronics magazine. It used metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS) technology for its image sensor. An important development in digital image compression technology was the discrete cosine transform (DCT), a lossy compression technique first proposed by Nasir Ahmed while he was working at the Kansas State University in 1972. DCT compression later became the basis for JPEG image standard, which was introduced by the Joint Photographic Experts Group in 1992. JPEG compresses images down to much smaller file sizes, and has become the most widely used image file format. The JPEG standard was largely responsible for popularizing digital photography. The first self- contained (portable) digital camera was created later in 1975 by Steven Sasson of Eastman Kodak. Sasson's camera used CCD image sensor chips developed by Fairchild Semiconductor in 1973. The camera weighed 8 pounds (3.6 kg), recorded black and white images to a cassette tape, had a resolution of 0.01 megapixels (10,000 pixels), and took 23 seconds to capture its first image in December 1975. The prototype camera was a technical exercise, not intended for production. While it was not until 1981 that the first consumer camera was produced by Sony, Inc., the groundwork for digital imaging and photography had been laid. The first digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera was the Nikon SVC prototype demonstrated in 1986, followed by the commercial Nikon QV-1000C released in 1988. The first widely commercially available digital camera was the 1990 Dycam Model 1; it also sold as the Logitech Fotoman. It used a CCD image sensor, stored pictures digitally, and connected directly to a computer for downloading images.Carolyn Said, \\"DYCAM Model 1: The first portable Digital Still Camera\\", MacWeek, vol. 4, No. 35, 16 Oct. 1990, p. 34. Originally offered to professional photographers for a hefty price, by the mid-to-late 1990s, due to technology advancements, digital cameras were commonly available to the general public. The advent of digital photography also gave way to cultural changes in the field of photography. Unlike with traditional photography, dark rooms and hazardous chemicals were no longer required for post-production of an image ‚Äì images could now be processed and enhanced from behind a computer screen in one's own home. This allowed for photographers to be more creative with their processing and editing techniques. As the field became more popular, types of digital photography and photographers diversified. Digital photography took photography itself from a small somewhat elite circle, to one that encompassed many people. The camera phone helped popularize digital photography, along with the Internet, social media, and the JPEG image format. The first cell phones with built-in digital cameras were produced in 2000 by Sharp and Samsung. Small, convenient, and easy to use, camera phones have made digital photography ubiquitous in the daily life of the general public. =Number of photos taken= According to research from KeyPoint Intelligence/InfoTrends, an estimated 400 billion digital photos were taken globally in 2011 and this will rise to 1.2 trillion photos in 2017. Several billion JPEG images are produced every day as of 2015. An estimated 85 percent of the photos taken in 2017 will be done with the smartphone rather than a traditional digital camera. Digital camera =Sensors= Image sensors read the intensity of light, and digital memory devices store the digital image information as RGB color space or as raw data. The two main types of sensors are charge-coupled devices (CCD), in which the photocharge is shifted to a central charge-to-voltage converter, and CMOS or active pixel sensors. =Multifunctionality and connectivity= Except for some linear array type of cameras at the highest-end and simple webcams at the lowest-end, a digital memory device (usually a memory card; floppy disks and CD-RWs are less common) is used for storing images, which may be transferred to a computer later. Digital cameras can take pictures, and may also record sound and video. Some can be used as webcams, some can use the PictBridge standard to connect to a printer without using a computer, and some can display pictures directly on a television set. Similarly, many camcorders can take still photographs, and store them on videotape or on flash memory cards with the same functionality as digital cameras. Digital photography is one of the most exceptional instances of the shift from converting conventional analog information to digital information. This shift is so tremendous because it was a chemical and mechanical process and became an all digital process with a built in computer in all digital cameras. =Performance metrics= The quality of a digital image is a composite of various factors, many of which are similar to those of film cameras. Pixel count (typically listed in megapixels, millions of pixels) is only one of the major factors, though it is the most heavily marketed figure of merit. Digital camera manufacturers advertise this figure because consumers can use it to easily compare camera capabilities. It is not, however, the major factor in evaluating a digital camera for most applications. The processing system inside the camera that turns the raw data into a color-balanced and pleasing photograph is usually more critical, which is why some 4+ megapixel cameras perform better than higher-end cameras. Resolution in pixels is not the only measure of image quality. A larger sensor with the same number of pixels generally produces a better image than a smaller one. One of the most important differences is an improvement in image noise. This is one of the advantages of digital SLR (single-lens reflex) cameras, which have larger sensors than simpler cameras (so-called point and shoot cameras) of the same resolution. *Lens quality: resolution, distortion, dispersion (see Lens (optics)) *Capture medium: CMOS, CCD, negative film, reversal film etc. *Capture format: pixel count, digital file type (RAW, TIFF, JPEG), film format (135 film, 120 film, 5x4, 10x8). *Processing: digital and/or chemical processing of 'negative' and 'print'. Pixel counts The number of pixels n for a given maximum resolution (w horizontal pixels by h vertical pixels) is the product n= w √ó h. This yields e. g. 1.92 megapixels (1,920,000 pixels) for an image of 1600 √ó 1200. The pixel count quoted by manufacturers can be misleading as it may not be the number of full-color pixels. For cameras using single-chip image sensors the number claimed is the total number of single-color-sensitive photosensors, whether they have different locations in the plane, as with the Bayer sensor, or in stacks of three co-located photosensors as in the Foveon X3 sensor. However, the images have different numbers of RGB pixels: Bayer-sensor cameras produce as many RGB pixels as photosensors via demosaicing (interpolation), while Foveon sensors produce uninterpolated image files with one-third as many RGB pixels as photosensors. Comparisons of megapixel ratings of these two types of sensors are sometimes a subject of dispute.Foveon X3 Sensor Claims Put to the Test The relative increase in detail resulting from an increase in resolution is better compared by looking at the number of pixels across (or down) the picture, rather than the total number of pixels in the picture area. For example, a sensor of 2560 √ó 1600 sensor elements is described as \\"4 megapixels\\" (2560 √ó 1600= 4,096,000). Increasing to 3200 √ó 2048 increases the pixels in the picture to 6,553,600 (6.5 megapixels), a factor of 1.6, but the pixels per cm in the picture (at the same image size) increases by only 1.25 times. A measure of the comparative increase in linear resolution is the square root of the increase in area resolution, i.e., megapixels in the entire image. Dynamic range Practical imaging systems both digital and film, have a limited \\"dynamic range\\": the range of luminosity that can be reproduced accurately. Highlights of the subject that are too bright are rendered as white, with no detail; shadows that are too dark are rendered as black. The loss of detail in the highlights is not abrupt with film, or in dark shadows with digital sensors. \\"Highlight burn-out\\" of digital sensors, is not usually abrupt in output images due to the tone mapping required to fit their large dynamic range into the more limited dynamic range of the output (be it SDR display or printing). Because sensor elements for different colours saturate in turn, there can be hue or saturation shift in burnt-out highlights. Some digital cameras can show these blown highlights in the image review, allowing the photographer to re-shoot the picture with a modified exposure. Others compensate for the total contrast of a scene by selectively exposing darker pixels longer. A third technique is used by Fujifilm in its FinePix S3 Pro digital SLR. The image sensor contains additional photodiodes of lower sensitivity than the main ones; these retain detail in parts of the image too bright for the main sensor. High-dynamic-range imaging (HDR) addresses this problem by increasing the dynamic range of images by either *increasing the dynamic range of the image sensor or *by using exposure bracketing and post- processing the separate images to create a single image with a higher dynamic range. =Storage= Many camera phones and most digital cameras use memory cards having flash memory to store image data. The majority of cards for separate cameras are Secure Digital (SD) format; many are CompactFlash (CF) and the other formats are rare. XQD card format was the last new form of card, targeted at high-definition camcorders and high-resolution digital photo cameras. Most modern digital cameras also use internal memory for a limited capacity for pictures that can be transferred to or from the card or through the camera's connections; even without a memory card inserted into the camera. Memory cards can hold vast numbers of photos, requiring attention only when the memory card is full. For most users, this means hundreds of quality photos stored on the same memory card. Images may be transferred to other media for archival or personal use. Cards with high speed and capacity are suited to video and burst mode (capture several photographs in a quick succession). Because photographers rely on the integrity of image files, it is important to take proper care of memory cards. Common advocacy calls for formatting of the cards after transferring the images onto a computer. However, since all cameras only do quick formatting of cards, it is advisable to carry out a more thorough formatting using appropriate software on a PC once in a while. Effectively, this involves scanning of the cards to search for possible errors. Market impact In late 2002, the cheapest digital cameras were available in the United States for around $100.http://www.kegel.com/cameras.html At the same time, many discount stores with photo labs introduced a \\"digital front end\\", allowing consumers to obtain true chemical prints (as opposed to ink-jet prints) in an hour. These prices were similar to those of prints made from film negatives. In July 2003, digital cameras entered the disposable camera market with the release of the Ritz Dakota Digital, a 1.2-megapixel (1280 x 960) CMOS-based digital camera costing only $11 (USD). Following the familiar single-use concept long in use with film cameras, Ritz intended the Dakota Digital for single use. When the pre-programmed 25-picture limit is reached, the camera is returned to the store, and the consumer receives back prints and a CD-ROM with their photos. The camera is then refurbished and resold. Since the introduction of the Dakota Digital, a number of similar single-use digital cameras have appeared. Most single-use digital cameras are nearly identical to the original Dakota Digital in specifications and function, though a few include superior specifications and more advanced functions (such as higher image resolutions and LCD screens). Most, if not all these single-use digital cameras cost less than $20 (USD), not including processing. However, the huge demand for complex digital cameras at competitive prices has often caused manufacturing shortcuts, evidenced by a large increase in customer complaints over camera malfunctions, high parts prices, and short service life. Some digital cameras offer only a 90-day warranty. Since 2003, digital cameras have outsold film cameras. Prices of 35mm compact cameras have dropped with manufacturers further outsourcing to countries such as China. Kodak announced in January 2004 that they would no longer sell Kodak-branded film cameras in the developed world. In January 2006, Nikon followed suit and announced they would stop production of all but two models of their film cameras. They will continue to produce the low-end Nikon FM10, and the high-end Nikon F6. In the same month, Konica Minolta announced it was pulling out of the camera business altogether. The price of 35mm and APS (Advanced Photo System) compact cameras have dropped, probably due to direct competition from digital and the resulting growth of the offer of second-hand film cameras. Pentax have reduced production of film cameras but not halted it. The technology has improved so rapidly that one of Kodak's film cameras was discontinued before it was awarded a \\"camera of the year\\" award later in the year. The decline in film camera sales has also led to a decline in purchases of film for such cameras. In November 2004, a German division of Agfa-Gevaert, AgfaPhoto, split off. Within six months it filed for bankruptcy. Konica Minolta Photo Imaging, Inc. ended production of Color film and paper worldwide by March 31, 2007. In addition, by 2005, Kodak employed less than a third of the employees it had twenty years earlier. It is not known if these job losses in the film industry have been offset in the digital image industry. Digital cameras have decimated the film photography industry through declining use of the expensive film rolls and development chemicals previously required to develop the photos. This has had a dramatic effect on companies such as Fuji, Kodak, and Agfa. Many stores that formerly offered photofinishing services or sold film no longer do, or have seen a tremendous decline. In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy after struggling to adapt to the changing industry. (See Photographic film.) In addition, digital photography has resulted in some positive market impacts as well. The increasing popularity of products such as digital photo frames and canvas prints is a direct result of the increasing popularity of digital photography. A man takes a photo with a smartphone, holding it somewhat awkwardly, as the form factor of a phone is not optimized for use as a camera Digital camera sales peaked in March 2012 averaging about 11 million units a month, but sales have declined significantly ever since. By March 2014, about 3 million were purchased each month, about 30 percent of the peak sales total. The decline may have bottomed out, with sales average hovering around 3 million a month. The main competitor is smartphones, most of which have built-in digital cameras, which routinely get better. Like most digital cameras, they also offer the ability to record videos. While smartphones continue to improve on a technical level, their form factor is not optimized for use as a camera and battery life is typically more limited compared to a digital camera. =Social impact= Digital photography has made photography available to a larger group of people. The new technology and editing programs available to photographers has changed the way photographs are presented to the public. There are photographs that are so heavily manipulated (\\"photoshopped\\") that they end up looking nothing like the original photograph and this changes the way they are perceived.Benovsky, Jiri. 2014. \\"The Limits of Photography.\\" International Journal Of Philosophical Studies 22, no. 5: 716‚Äì733. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (Retrieved February 23, 2018). Until the advent of the digital camera, amateur photographers used either print or slide film for their cameras. Slides are developed and shown to an audience using a slide projector. Digital photography revolutionized the industry by eliminating the delay and cost. The ease of viewing, transferring, editing and distributing digital images allowed consumers to manage their digital photos with ordinary home computers rather than specialized equipment. Camera phones, being the majority of cameras, have arguably the largest impact. The user can set their smartphones to upload their products to the Internet, preserving them even if the camera is destroyed or the images deleted. Some high street photography shops have self- service kiosks that allow images to be printed directly from smartphones via Bluetooth technology. Archivists and historians have noticed the transitory nature of digital media. Unlike film and print, which are tangible and immediately accessible to a person, digital image storage is ever-changing, with old media and decoding software becoming obsolete or inaccessible by new technologies. Historians are concerned that we are creating a historical void where information and details about an era would have been lost within either failed or inaccessible digital media. They recommend that professional and amateur users develop strategies for digital preservation by migrating stored digital images from old technologies to new. Scrapbookers who may have used film for creating artistic and personal memoirs may need to modify their approach to digital photo books to personalize them and retain the special qualities of traditional photo albums. The web has been a popular medium for storing and sharing photos ever since the first photograph was published on the web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992 (an image of the CERN house band Les Horribles Cernettes). Today photo sharing sites such as Flickr, Picasa, and PhotoBucket, as well as social Web sites, are used by millions of people to share their pictures. In today's world digital photography and social media websites allow organizations and corporations to make photographs more accessible to a greater and more diverse population. For example, National Geographic Magazine has a Twitter, Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram accounts and each one includes content aimed for the type of audience that are part of each social media community.Goldberg, Susan. 2017. \\"OUR SOCIAL MEDIA MISSION.\\" National Geographic 231, no. 4: 4. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (Retrieved February 10, 2018). It is also important to remember that digital photography has also had an impact in other fields, such as medicine. It has allowed doctors to help diagnose diabetic retinopathy and it is used in hospitals to diagnose and treat other diseases.Srihatrai, Parinya, and Thanita Hlowchitsieng. 2018. \\"The diagnostic accuracy of single- and five-field fundus photography in diabetic retinopathy screening by primary care physicians.\\" Indian Journal Of Ophthalmology 66, no. 1: 94‚Äì97. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (Retrieve February 23, 2018). Digitally altered imagery New technology with digital cameras and computer editing affects the way we perceive photographic images today. The ability to create and fabricate realistic imagery digitally as opposed to untouched photos changes the audience's perception of ‚Äòtruth‚Äô in digital photography Manipulation in the digital era allows us to brush up our pictures, shape our memories to be picture perfect and therefore shape our identities. Recent research and innovation Research and development continues to refine the lighting, optics, sensors, processing, storage, display, and software used in digital photography. Here are a few examples. *3D models can be created from collections of normal images. The resulting scene can be viewed from novel viewpoints, but creating the model is very computationally intensive. An example is Microsoft's Photosynth, which provided some models of famous places as examples. *Panoramic photographs can be created directly in camera without the need for any external processing. Some cameras feature a 3D Panorama capability, combining shots taken with a single lens from different angles to create a sense of depth. *High-dynamic-range cameras and displays are commercially available. Sensors with dynamic range in excess of 1,000,000:1 are in development, and software is also available to combine multiple non-HDR images (shot with different exposures) into an HDR image. *Motion blur can be dramatically removed by a flutter shutter (a flickering shutter that adds a signature to the blur, which postprocessing recognizes). It is not yet commercially available. *Advanced bokeh techniques use a hardware system of 2 sensors, one to take the photo as usual while the other records depth information. Bokeh effect and refocusing can then be applied to an image after the photo is taken. *In advanced camera or camcorders, manipulating the sensitivity of the sensor not one, but 2 or more neutral density filters are available. *An object's specular reflection can be captured using computer- controlled lights and sensors. This is needed to create attractive images of oil paintings, for instance. It is not yet commercially available, but some museums are starting to use it. *Dust reduction systems help keep dust off of image sensors. Originally introduced only by a few cameras like Olympus DSLRs, have now become standard in most models and brands of detachable lens camera, except the low-end or cheap ones. Other areas of progress include improved sensors, more powerful software, advanced camera processors (sometimes using more than one processor, e.g., the Canon 7d camera has 2 Digic 4 processors), enlarged gamut displays, built in GPS and WiFi, and computer-controlled lighting. Comparison with film photography =Advantages already in consumer level cameras= The primary advantage of consumer-level digital cameras is the low recurring cost, as users need not purchase photographic film. Processing costs may be reduced or even eliminated. Digicams tend also to be easier to carry and to use, than comparable film cameras. They more easily adapt to modern use of pictures. Some, particularly those that are smartphones, can send their pictures directly to e-mail or web pages or other electronic distribution. =Advantages of professional digital cameras= The Golden Gate Bridge retouched for painterly light effects *Immediate image review and deletion is possible; lighting and composition can be assessed immediately, which ultimately conserves storage space. *High volume of images to medium ratio; allowing for extensive photography sessions without changing film rolls. To most users a single memory card is sufficient for the lifetime of the camera whereas film rolls are a re-incurring cost of film cameras. *Faster workflow: Management (colour and file), manipulation and printing tools are more versatile than conventional film processes. However, batch processing of RAW files can be time-consuming, even on a fast computer. *Much faster ingest of images, it will take no more than a few seconds to transfer a high resolution RAW file from a memory card vs many minutes to scan film with a high quality scanner. *Precision and reproducibility of processing: since processing in the digital domain is purely numerical, image processing using deterministic (non-random) algorithms is perfectly reproducible and eliminates variations common with photochemical processing that make many image processing techniques difficult if not impractical. *Digital manipulation: A digital image can be modified and manipulated much easier and faster than with traditional negative and print methods. The digital image to the right was captured in raw image format, processed and output in 3 different ways from the source RAW file, then merged and further processed for color saturation and other special effects to produce a more dramatic result than was originally captured with the RAW image. Manufacturers such as Nikon and Canon have promoted the adoption of digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) by photojournalists. Images captured at 2+ megapixels are deemed of sufficient quality for small images in newspaper or magazine reproduction. Eight- to 24-megapixel images, found in modern digital SLRs, when combined with high-end lenses, can approximate the detail of film prints from 35 mm film based SLRs. =Disadvantages of digital cameras= *As with any sampled signal, the combination of regular (periodic) pixel structure of common electronic image sensors and regular (periodic) structure of (typically man-made) objects being photographed can cause objectionable aliasing artefacts, such as false colors when using cameras using a Bayer pattern sensor. Aliasing is also present in film, but typically manifests itself in less obvious ways (such as increased granularity) due to the stochastic grain structure (stochastic sampling) of film. A large number of mechanical film camera existed, such as the Leica M2. These battery-less devices had advantages over digital devices in harsh or remote conditions. =Equivalent features= ; Image noise and grain Noise in a digital camera's image may sometimes be visually similar to film grain in a film camera. ; Speed of use Turn of the century digital cameras had a long start-up delay compared to film cameras, i.e., the delay from when they are turned on until they are ready to take the first shot, but this is no longer the case for modern digital cameras with start-up times under 1/4 seconds. ; Frame rate While some film cameras could reach up to 14 fps, like the Canon F-1 with rare high speed motor drive., professional digital SLR cameras can take still photographs at highest frame rates. While the Sony SLT technology allows rates of up to 12 fps, the Canon EOS-1Dx can take stills at a 14 fps rate. The Nikon F5 is limited to 36 continuous frames (the length of the film) without the cumbersome bulk film back, while the digital Nikon D5 is able to capture over 100 14-bit RAW images before its buffer must be cleared and the remaining space on the storage media can be used. ; Image longevity Depending on the materials and how they are stored, analog photographic film and prints may fade as they age. Similarly, the media on which digital images are stored or printed can decay or become corrupt, leading to a loss of image integrity. ; Colour reproduction Colour reproduction (gamut) is dependent on the type and quality of film or sensor used and the quality of the optical system and film processing. Different films and sensors have different color sensitivity; the photographer needs to understand his equipment, the light conditions, and the media used to ensure accurate colour reproduction. Many digital cameras offer RAW format (sensor data), which makes it possible to choose color space in the development stage regardless of camera settings. Even in RAW format, however, the sensor and the camera's dynamics can only capture colors within the gamut supported by the hardware. When that image is transferred for reproduction on any device, the widest achievable gamut is the gamut that the end device supports. For a monitor, it is the gamut of the display device. For a photographic print, it is the gamut of the device that prints the image on a specific type of paper. Color gamut or Color space is an area where points of color fit in a three-dimensional space. Professional photographers often use specially designed and calibrated monitors that help them to reproduce color accurately and consistently. =Frame aspect ratios= Most digital point & shoot cameras have an aspect ratio of 1.33 (4:3), the same as analog television or early movies. However, a 35 mm picture's aspect ratio is 1.5 (3:2). Several digital cameras take photos in either ratio, and nearly all digital SLRs take pictures in a 3:2 ratio, as most can use lenses designed for 35 mm film. Some photo labs print photos on 4:3 ratio paper, as well as the existing 3:2. In 2005 Panasonic launched the first consumer camera with a native aspect ratio of 16:9, matching HDTV. This is similar to a 7:4 aspect ratio, which was a common size for APS film. Different aspect ratios is one of the reasons consumers have issues when cropping photos. An aspect ratio of 4:3 translates to a size of 4.5\\"x6.0\\". This loses half an inch when printing on the \\"standard\\" size of 4\\"x6\\", an aspect ratio of 3:2. Similar cropping occurs when printing on other sizes, i.e., 5\\"x7\\", 8\\"x10\\", or 11\\"x14\\".

The prices of these institutional or library subscriptions have been rising much faster than the Consumer Price Index for several decades,. while the funds available to the libraries have remained static or have declined in real terms. As a result, academic and research libraries have regularly canceled serial subscriptions to accommodate price increases of the remaining current subscriptions.. Causes The subscription prices of scholarly journals have been increasing at a rate faster than the inflation rate for several decades. This chronic inflation is caused by several factors, discussed below. =Price inelasticity= Each journal title publishes unique research findings and as a result is a unique commodity that cannot be replaced in an academic library collection by another journal title, such as a less expensive journal on the same subject, as one could with commodities. The publisher thus has the ability to act as a monopolist. Scholarly journals vary greatly in quality as do the individual articles that they publish. The highest quality journals are often expected and demanded by scholars to be included in their institution's library collections, often with little regard or knowledge about the subscription costs. Traditional metrics for quality in scholarly journals include Impact Factor and Citation count as recorded by Journal Citation Reports. This leads to price inelasticity for these higher quality journals. = Publishers = Another possible set of factors in this situation includes the increasing domination of scholarly communication by a small number of commercial publishers, whose journals are far more costly than those of most academic societies.. However, the institutional subscription prices for journals published by some academic society publishers (see below) have also exhibited inflationary patterns similar to those seen among commercial publishers. The earnings of the American Chemical Society (ACS), for example, is based, in large parts, on publications. In 1999, the income of the ACS was $349 million, where $250 million came from information services. According to a 2004 House of Commons report (by the Science and Technology Committee), the ACS is one of the driving forces of the STM (science, technology, medicine) serials crisis. According to the same report, the crisis started around 1990, when many universities and libraries complained about the dramatic inflation of STM subscription prices especially for the flagship JACS, which is exclusively sold as a bundle with all other ACS journals. The report further complains that Every year the Library Journal publishes a summary of periodical pricing and inflation. \\"The rate of price increase is analyzed for more than 18,000 e-journal packages handled by EBSCO Information Services...For 2019, the average rate of increase over two years was 5.5%, up slightly from 5% in 2018.\\" = Growth in scholarly publishing = An additional problem is a dramatic increase in the volume of research literature and increasing specialization of that research, i.e. the creation of academic subfields. This includes a growth in the number of scholars and an increase in potential demand for these journals. At the same time, funds available to purchase journals are often decreasing in real terms. Libraries have seen their collection budgets decline in real terms compared to the United States Periodical Price Index. There are other library expenditures such as computers and networking equipment that have also had a negative impact on scholarly publishing. As a result of the increasing cost of journals, academic libraries have reduced their expenditures on other types of publications such as scholarly monographs. = Exchange rates = Currency exchange rates can serve to increase the volatility of subscription prices throughout the world. For example, journal publishers in Europe often set their prices in euro, not United States dollars, so subscribers in the United States will experience varying prices due to exchange rate fluctuations. The converse is true for European institutions who subscribe to journals published in the United States. As the United States and Europe publish the vast majority of scholarly journals, libraries in other regions are subject to ever greater uncertainty. Although exchange rates can go down as well as up, long-term trends in currency values can lead to chronic price inflation experienced by particular libraries or collections.  Solutions, alternatives and developments  There is much discussion among case librarians and scholars about the crisis and how to address its consequences. Academic and research libraries are resorting to several tactics to contain costs, while maintaining access to the latest scholarly research for their users. These tactics include: increasingly borrowing journals from one another (see interlibrary loan) or purchasing single articles from commercial document suppliers instead of subscribing to whole journals. Additionally, academic and research libraries cancel subscriptions to the least used or least cost-effective journals. Another tactic has been converting from printed to electronic copies of journals, however, publishers sometimes charge more for the online edition of a journal, and price increases for online journals have followed the same inflationary pattern as have journals in paper format. Many individual libraries have joined co-operative consortia that negotiate license terms for journal subscriptions on behalf of their member institutions. Another tactic has been to encourage various methods of obtaining free access to journals.  Big deal  A subscription to a bundle of several journals, at a discounted price, is known as a \\"big deal\\". It became prevalent in the 2000s as the amount of content offered by the Big Five grew beyond the perceived ability to pick specific titles to subscribe to. In a big deal, a library or consortium of libraries typically pays several million dollars per year to subscribe to hundreds or thousands of toll access journals. In the 2010s, efforts increased to \\"unwrap\\" or \\"unbundle\\" the subscription, if not to cancel them altogether. Some \\"libraries are electing to critically appraise these big deals by assessing their collections, the value for money they are receiving from these packages, and how they might more strategically spend their finite collections resources.\\" Services emerged for libraries to share information and reduce the information asymmetry in negotiations with the publishers, like the SPARC cancellation trackinghttps://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-cancellation- tracking/ and the Unpaywall Journals data analysis tool.  Open access  Developed in part as a response to the serials crisis, open access models have included new models of financing scholarly journals that may serve to reduce the monopoly power of scholarly journal publishers which is considered a contributing factor to the creation of the serials crisis. These include open access journals and open access repositories.

In the surroundings, through suitable passive linkages, the whole of the work done by such forces can lift a weight. Also, just through such mechanisms, energy can transfer from the surroundings to the system; in a sign convention used in physics (though chemistry uses the opposite sign convention), such energy transfer is counted as a negative amount of work done by the system on its surroundings. The externally measured forces and external effects may be electromagnetic,Guggenheim, E.A. (1985). Thermodynamics.

Thermal Physics, second edition, W.H. Freeman, San Francisco, . For thermodynamic work, these externally measured quantities are exactly matched by values of or contributions to changes in macroscopic internal state variables of the system, which always occur in conjugate pairs, for example pressure and volume or magnetic flux density and magnetization. By an external system that lies in the surroundings, not necessarily a thermodynamic system as strictly defined by the usual thermodynamic state variables, otherwise than by transfer of matter, work can be said to be done on a thermodynamic system. Part of such surroundings-defined work can have a mechanism just as for system-defined thermodynamic work done by the system, while the rest of such surroundings-defined work appears, to the thermodynamic system, not as a negative amount of thermodynamic work done by it, but, rather, as heat transferred to it. The paddle stirring experiments of Joule provide an example, illustrating the concept of isochoric (or constant volume) mechanical work, in this case sometimes called shaft work. Such work is not thermodynamic work as defined here, because it acts through friction, within, and on the surface of, the thermodynamic system, and does not act through macroscopic forces that the system can spontaneously exert on its surroundings, describable by its state variables. Surroundings-defined work can also be non- mechanical. An example is Joule heating, because it occurs through friction as the electric current passes through the thermodynamic system. When it is done isochorically, and no matter is transferred, such an energy transfer is regarded as a heat transfer into the system of interest. Thermodynamic work is a specialized version of the concept of work in physics. In the SI system of measurement, work is measured in joules (symbol: J). The rate at which work is performed is power. History =1824= Work, i.e. \\"weight lifted through a height\\", was originally defined in 1824 by Sadi Carnot in his famous paper Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire, where he used the term motive power for work. Specifically, according to Carnot: > We use here motive power to express the useful effect that a motor is > capable of producing. This effect can always be likened to the elevation of > a weight to a certain height. It has, as we know, as a measure, the product > of the weight multiplied by the height to which it is raised. =1845= Joule's apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat In 1845, the English physicist James Joule wrote a paper On the mechanical equivalent of heat for the British Association meeting in Cambridge.Joule, J.P. (1845) \\"On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat\\", Brit. Assoc. Rep., trans. Chemical Sect, p.31, which was read before the British Association at Cambridge, June In this paper, he reported his best-known experiment, in which the mechanical power released through the action of a \\"weight falling through a height\\" was used to turn a paddle-wheel in an insulated barrel of water. In this experiment, the motion of the paddle wheel, through agitation and friction, heated the body of water, so as to increase its temperature. Both the temperature change ‚àÜT of the water and the height of the fall ‚àÜh of the weight mg were recorded. Using these values, Joule was able to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat. Joule estimated a mechanical equivalent of heat to be 819 ft‚Ä¢lbf/Btu (4.41 J/cal). The modern day definitions of heat, work, temperature, and energy all have connection to this experiment. In this arrangement of apparatus, it never happens that the process runs in reverse, with the water driving the paddles so as to raise the weight, not even slightly. Mechanical work was done by the apparatus of falling weight, pulley, and paddles, which lay in the surroundings of the water. Their motion scarcely affected the volume of the water. Work that does not change the volume of the water is said to be isochoric; it is irreversible. The energy supplied by the fall of the weight passed into the water as heat. Overview =Conservation of energy= A pre-supposed guiding principle of thermodynamics is the conservation of energy. The total energy of a system is the sum of its internal energy, of its potential energy as a whole system in an external force field, such as gravity, and of its kinetic energy as a whole system in motion. Thermodynamics has special concern with transfers of energy, from a body of matter, such as, for example a cylinder of steam, to the surroundings of the body, by mechanisms through which the body exerts macroscopic forces on its surroundings so as to lift a weight there; such mechanisms are the ones that are said to mediate thermodynamic work. Besides transfer of energy as work, thermodynamics admits transfer of energy as heat. For a process in a closed (no transfer of matter) thermodynamic system, the first law of thermodynamics relates changes in the internal energy (or other cardinal energy function, depending on the conditions of the transfer) of the system to those two modes of energy transfer, as work, and as heat. Adiabatic work is done without matter transfer and without heat transfer. In principle, in thermodynamics, for a process in a closed system, quantity of heat transferred is defined by the amount of adiabatic work that would be needed to effect the change in the system that is occasioned by the heat transfer. In experimental practice, heat transfer is often estimated calorimetrically, through change of temperature of a known quantity of calorimetric material substance. Energy can also be transferred to or from a system through transfer of matter. The possibility of such transfer defines the system as an open system, as opposed to a closed system. By definition, such transfer is neither as work nor as heat. Changes in the potential energy of a body as a whole with respect to forces in its surroundings, and in the kinetic energy of the body moving as a whole with respect to its surroundings, are by definition excluded from the body's cardinal energy (examples are internal energy and enthalpy). =Nearly reversible transfer of energy by work in the surroundings= In the surroundings of a thermodynamic system, external to it, all the various mechanical and non-mechanical macroscopic forms of work can be converted into each other with no limitation in principle due to the laws of thermodynamics, so that the energy conversion efficiency can approach 100% in some cases; such conversion is required to be frictionless, and consequently adiabatic.F.C.Andrews Thermodynamics: Principles and Applications (Wiley- Interscience 1971), , p.17-18. In particular, in principle, all macroscopic forms of work can be converted into the mechanical work of lifting a weight, which was the original form of thermodynamic work considered by Carnot and Joule (see History section above). Some authors have considered this equivalence to the lifting of a weight as a defining characteristic of work.Silbey, R.J., Alberty, R.A., Bawendi, M.G. (2005). Physical Chemistry, 4th edition, Wiley, Hoboken NJ., , p.31K.Denbigh The Principles of Chemical Equilibrium (Cambridge University Press 1st ed. 1955, reprinted 1964), p.14.J.Kestin A Course in Thermodynamics (Blaisdell Publishing 1966), p.121.M.A.Saad Thermodynamics for Engineers (Prentice-Hall 1966) p.45-46. For example, with the apparatus of Joule's experiment in which, through pulleys, a weight descending in the surroundings drives the stirring of a thermodynamic system, the descent of the weight can be diverted by a re-arrangement of pulleys, so that it lifts another weight in the surroundings, instead of stirring the thermodynamic system. Such conversion may be idealized as nearly frictionless, though it occurs relatively quickly. It usually comes about through devices that are not simple thermodynamic systems (a simple thermodynamic system is a homogeneous body of material substances). For example, the descent of the weight in Joule's stirring experiment reduces the weight's total energy. It is described as loss of gravitational potential energy by the weight, due to change of its macroscopic position in the gravity field, in contrast to, for example, loss of the weight's internal energy due to changes in its entropy, volume, and chemical composition. Though it occurs relatively rapidly, because the energy remains nearly fully available as work in one way or another, such diversion of work in the surroundings may be idealized as nearly reversible, or nearly perfectly efficient. In contrast, the conversion of heat into work in a heat engine can never exceed the Carnot efficiency, as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics. Such energy conversion, through work done relatively rapidly, in a practical heat engine, by a thermodynamic system on its surroundings, cannot be idealized, not even nearly, as reversible. Thermodynamic work done by a thermodynamic system on its surroundings is defined so as to comply with this principle. Historically, thermodynamics was about how a thermodynamic system could do work on its surroundings. =Work done by and on a simple thermodynamic system= Work done on, and work done by, a thermodynamic system need to be distinguished, through consideration of their precise mechanisms. Work done on a thermodynamic system, by devices or systems in the surroundings, is performed by actions such as compression, and includes shaft work, stirring, and rubbing. Such work done by compression is thermodynamic work as here defined. But shaft work, stirring, and rubbing are not thermodynamic work as here defined, in that they do not change the volume of the system against its resisting pressure. Work without change of volume is known as isochoric work, for example when an agency, in the surroundings of the system, drives a frictional action on the surface or in the interior of the system. In a process of transfer of energy from or to a thermodynamic system, the change of internal energy of the system is defined in theory by the amount of adiabatic work that would have been necessary to reach the final from the initial state, such adiabatic work being measurable only through the externally measurable mechanical or deformation variables of the system, that provide full information about the forces exerted by the surroundings on the system during the process. In the case of some of Joule's measurements, the process was so arranged that some heating that occurred outside the system (in the substance of the paddles) by the frictional process also led to heat transfer from the paddles into the system during the process, so that the quantity of work done by the surrounds on the system could be calculated as shaft work, an external mechanical variable.Buchdahl, H.A. (1966). The Concepts of Classical Thermodynamics, Cambridge University Press, London, p. 40.Bailyn, M. (1994). A Survey of Thermodynamics, American Institute of Physics Press, New York, , pp. 35‚Äì36. The amount of energy transferred as work is measured through quantities defined externally to the system of interest, and thus belonging to its surroundings. In an important sign convention, preferred in chemistry, work that adds to the internal energy of the system is counted as positive. On the other hand, for historical reasons, an oft-encountered sign convention, preferred in physics, is to consider work done by the system on its surroundings as positive. =Processes not described by macroscopic work= One kind of heat transfer, through direct contact between a closed system and its surroundings, is by the microscopic thermal motions of particles and their associated inter-molecular potential energies.G.J. Van Wylen and R.E. Sonntag, Fundamentals of Classical Thermodynamics, Chapter 4 - Work and heat, (3rd edition) Microscopic accounts of such processes are the province of statistical mechanics, not of macroscopic thermodynamics. Another kind of heat transfer is by radiation.Prevost, P. (1791). M√©moire sur l'equilibre du feu. Journal de Physique (Paris), vol 38 pp. 314-322.Planck, M. (1914). The Theory of Heat Radiation, second edition translated by M. Masius, P. Blakiston's Son and Co., Philadelphia, 1914. Radiative transfer of energy is irreversible in the sense that it occurs only from a hotter to a colder system, never the other way. There are several forms of dissipative transduction of energy that can occur internally within a system at a microscopic level, such as friction including bulk and shear viscosityRayleigh, J.W.S (1878/1896/1945). The Theory of Sound, volume 2, Dover, New York, chemical reaction, unconstrained expansion as in Joule expansion and in diffusion, and phase change. Thermodynamic work does not account for any energy transferred between systems as heat or through transfer of matter. =Open systems= For an open system, the first law of thermodynamics admits three forms of energy transfer, as work, as heat, and as energy associated with matter that is transferred. The latter cannot be split uniquely into heat and work components. One-way convection of internal energy is a form a transport of energy but is not, as sometimes mistakenly supposed (a relic of the caloric theory of heat), transfer of energy as heat, because one-way convection is transfer of matter; nor is it transfer of energy as work. Nevertheless, if the wall between the system and its surroundings is thick and contains fluid, in the presence of a gravitational field, convective circulation within the wall can be considered as indirectly mediating transfer of energy as heat between the system and its surroundings, though the source and destination of the transferred energy are not in direct contact. =Fictively imagined reversible thermodynamic \\"processes\\"= For purposes of theoretical calculations about a thermodynamic system, one can imagine fictive idealized thermodynamic \\"processes\\" that occur so slowly that they do not incur friction within or on the surface of system; they can then be regarded as virtually reversible. These fictive processes proceed along paths on geometrical surfaces that are described exactly by a characteristic equation of the thermodynamic system. Those geometrical surfaces are the loci of possible states of thermodynamic equilibrium for the system. Really possible thermodynamic processes, occurring at practical rates, even when they occur only by work assessed in the surroundings as adiabatic, without heat transfer, always incur friction within the system, and so are always irreversible. The paths of such really possible processes always depart from those geometrical characteristic surfaces. Even when they occur only by work assessed in the surroundings as adiabatic, without heat transfer, such departures always entail entropy production. =Joule heating and rubbing= The definition of thermodynamic work is in terms of the changes of the system's extensive deformationBuchdahl, H.A. (1966). The Concepts of Classical Thermodynamics, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, page 6. (and chemical constitutive and certain other) state variables, such as volume, molar chemical constitution, or electric polarisation. Examples of state variables that are not extensive deformation or other such variables are temperature and entropy , as for example in the expression . Changes of such variables are not actually physically measureable by use of a single simple adiabatic thermodynamic process; they are processes that occur neither by thermodynamic work nor by transfer of matter, and therefore are said occur by heat transfer. The quantity of thermodynamic work is defined as work done by the system on its surroundings. According to the second law of thermodynamics, such work is irreversible. To get an actual and precise physical measurement of a quantity of thermodynamic work, it is necessary to take account of the irreversibility by restoring the system to its initial condition by running a cycle, for example a Carnot cycle, that includes the target work as a step. The work done by the system on its surroundings is calculated from the quantities that constitute the whole cycle.Lavenda, B.H. (2010). A New Perspective on Thermodynamics, Springer, New York, , pp. 117‚Äì118. A different cycle would be needed to actually measure the work done by the surroundings on the system. This is a reminder that rubbing the surface of a system appears to the rubbing agent in the surroundings as mechanical, though not thermodynamic, work done on the system, not as heat, but appears to the system as heat transferred to the system, not as thermodynamic work. The production of heat by rubbing is irreversible;Planck, M. (1926). √úber die Begr√ºndung des zweiten Hauptsatzes der Thermodynamik, Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften: Physikalisch-mathematische Klasse: 453‚Äì463. historically, it was a piece of evidence for the rejection of the caloric theory of heat as a conserved substance.Lavenda, B.H. (2010). A New Perspective on Thermodynamics, Springer, New York, , page 20. The irreversible process known as Joule heating also occurs through a change of a non-deformation extensive state variable. Accordingly, in the opinion of Lavenda, work is not as primitive concept as is heat, which can be measured by calorimetry.Lavenda, B.H. (2010). A New Perspective on Thermodynamics, Springer, New York, , page 120. This opinion does not negate the now customary thermodynamic definition of heat in terms of adiabatic work. Known as a thermodynamic operation, the initiating factor of a thermodynamic process is, in many cases, a change in the permeability of a wall between the system and the surroundings. Rubbing is not a change in wall permeability. Kelvin's statement of the second law of thermodynamics uses the notion of an \\"inanimate material agency\\"; this notion is sometimes regarded as puzzling.Lavenda, B.H. (2010). A New Perspective on Thermodynamics, Springer, New York, , page 141. The triggering of a process of rubbing can occur only in the surroundings, not in a thermodynamic system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium. Such triggering may be described as a thermodynamic operation. Formal definition In thermodynamics, the quantity of work done by a closed system on its surroundings is defined by factors strictly confined to the interface of the surroundings with the system and to the surroundings of the system, for example, an extended gravitational field in which the system sits, that is to say, to things external to the system. A main concern of thermodynamics is the properties of materials. Thermodynamic work is defined for the purposes of thermodynamic calculations about bodies of material, known as thermodynamic systems. Consequently, thermodynamic work is defined in terms of quantities that describe the states of materials, which appear as the usual thermodynamic state variables, such as volume, pressure, temperature, chemical composition, and electric polarization. For example, to measure the pressure inside a system from outside it, the observer needs the system to have a wall that can move by a measurable amount in response to pressure differences between the interior of the system and the surroundings. In this sense, part of the definition of a thermodynamic system is the nature of the walls that confine it. Several kinds of thermodynamic work are especially important. One simple example is pressure‚Äìvolume work. The pressure of concern is that exerted by the surroundings on the surface of the system, and the volume of interest is the negative of the increment of volume gained by the system from the surroundings. It is usually arranged that the pressure exerted by the surroundings on the surface of the system is well defined and equal to the pressure exerted by the system on the surroundings. This arrangement for transfer of energy as work can be varied in a particular way that depends on the strictly mechanical nature of pressure‚Äìvolume work. The variation consists in letting the coupling between the system and surroundings be through a rigid rod that links pistons of different areas for the system and surroundings. Then for a given amount of work transferred, the exchange of volumes involves different pressures, inversely with the piston areas, for mechanical equilibrium. This cannot be done for the transfer of energy as heat because of its non-mechanical nature.Tisza, L. (1966). Generalized Thermodynamics, M.I.T. Press, Cambridge MA, p. 37. Another important kind of work is isochoric work, i.e., work that involves no eventual overall change of volume of the system between the initial and the final states of the process. Examples are friction on the surface of the system as in Rumford's experiment; shaft work such as in Joule's experiments; stirring of the system by a magnetic paddle inside it, driven by a moving magnetic field from the surroundings; and vibrational action on the system that leaves its eventual volume unchanged, but involves friction within the system. Isochoric mechanical work for a body in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium is done only by the surroundings on the body, not by the body on the surroundings, so that the sign of isochoric mechanical work with the physics sign convention is always negative. When work, for example pressure‚Äìvolume work, is done on its surroundings by a closed system that cannot pass heat in or out because it is confined by an adiabatic wall, the work is said to be adiabatic for the system as well as for the surroundings. When mechanical work is done on such an adiabatically enclosed system by the surroundings, it can happen that friction in the surroundings is negligible, for example in the Joule experiment with the falling weight driving paddles that stir the system. Such work is adiabatic for the surroundings, even though it is associated with friction within the system. Such work may or may not be isochoric for the system, depending on the system and its confining walls. If it happens to be isochoric for the system (and does not eventually change other system state variables such as magnetization), it appears as a heat transfer to the system, and does not appear to be adiabatic for the system. Sign convention In the early history of thermodynamics, a positive amount of work done by the system on the surroundings leads to energy being lost from the system. This historical sign convention has been used in many physics textbooks and is used in the present article.Schroeder, D. V. An Introduction to Thermal Physics, 2000, Addison Wesley Longman, San Francisco, CA, , p. 18 According to the first law of thermodynamics for a closed system, any net change in the internal energy U must be fully accounted for, in terms of heat Q entering the system and work W done by the system: :\\\\Delta U = Q - W.\\\\; Freedman, Roger A., and Young, Hugh D. (2008). 12th Edition. Chapter 19: First Law of Thermodynamics, page 656. Pearson Addison-Wesley, San Francisco. An alternate sign convention is to consider the work performed on the system by its surroundings as positive. This leads to a change in sign of the work, so that \\\\Delta U = Q + W\\\\,. This convention has historically been used in chemistry, but has been adopted in several modern physics textbooks.Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry (IUPAC Green Book) See Sec. 2.11 Chemical Thermodynamics, p. 56.Planck, M. (1897/1903). Treatise on Thermodynamics, translated by A. Ogg, Longmans, Green & Co., London., p. 43.Adkins, C.J. (1968/1983). Equilibrium Thermodynamics, (1st edition 1968), third edition 1983, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge UK, , pp. 35‚Äì36. This equation reflects the fact that the heat transferred and the work done are not properties of the state of the system. Given only the initial state and the final state of the system, one can only say what the total change in internal energy was, not how much of the energy went out as heat, and how much as work. This can be summarized by saying that heat and work are not state functions of the system. This is in contrast to classical mechanics, where net work exerted by a particle is a state function. Pressure‚Äìvolume work Pressure‚Äìvolume work (or PV work) occurs when the volume of a system changes. PV work is often measured in units of litre- atmospheres where = . However, the litre-atmosphere is not a recognised unit in the SI system of units, which measures P in Pascal (Pa), V in m3, and PV in Joule (J), where 1 J = 1 Pa¬∑m3. PV work is an important topic in chemical thermodynamics. For a process in a closed system, occurring slowly enough for accurate definition of the pressure on the inside of the system's wall that moves and transmits force to the surroundings, described as quasi- static,Callen, H. B. (1960/1985), Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics, (first edition 1960), second edition 1985, John Wiley & Sons, New York, , p. 19.M√ºnster, A. (1970), Classical Thermodynamics, translated by E. S. Halberstadt, Wiley‚ÄìInterscience, London, , p. 24. work is represented by the following equation between differentials: :\\\\delta W = P dV \\\\, where \\\\delta W denotes an infinitesimal increment of work done by the system, transferring energy to the surroundings; P denotes the pressure inside the system, that it exerts on the moving wall that transmits force to the surroundings.Borgnakke, C., Sontag, R. E. (2009). Fundamentals of Thermodynamics, seventh edition, Wiley, , p. 94. In the alternative sign convention the right hand side has a negative sign. dV denotes the infinitesimal increment of the volume of the system. Moreover, :W=\\\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} P\\\\,dV. where W denotes the work done by the system during the whole of the reversible process. The first law of thermodynamics can then be expressed as :dU = \\\\delta Q - P dV \\\\, . (In the alternative sign convention where W = work done on the system, \\\\delta W = - P dV \\\\,. However, dU = \\\\delta Q - P dV \\\\, is unchanged.) =Path dependence= PV work is path-dependent and is, therefore, a thermodynamic process function. In general, the term is not an exact differential.Haase, R. (1971). Survey of Fundamental Laws, chapter 1 of Thermodynamics, pages 1‚Äì97 of volume 1, ed. W. Jost, of Physical Chemistry. An Advanced Treatise, ed. H. Eyring, D. Henderson, W. Jost, Academic Press, New York, lcn 73‚Äì117081, p. 21. The statement that a process is reversible and adiabatic gives important information about the process but does not determine the path uniquely, because the path can include several slow goings backwards and forward in volume, as long as there is no transfer of energy as heat. The first law of thermodynamics states dU =\\\\delta Q - \\\\delta W . For an adiabatic process, \\\\delta Q=0 and thus the integral amount of work done is equal to minus the change in internal energy. For a reversible adiabatic process, the integral amount of work done during the process depends only on the initial and final states of the process and is the one and the same for every intermediate path. If the process took a path other than an adiabatic path, the work would be different. This would only be possible if heat flowed into/out of the system. In a non-adiabatic process, there are indefinitely many paths between the initial and final states. In the current mathematical notation, the differential \\\\delta W is an inexact differential. In another notation, is written (with a line through the d). This notation indicates that is not an exact one-form. The line-through is merely a flag to warn us there is actually no function (0-form) which is the potential of . If there were, indeed, this function , we should be able to just use Stokes Theorem to evaluate this putative function, the potential of , at the boundary of the path, that is, the initial and final points, and therefore the work would be a state function. This impossibility is consistent with the fact that it does not make sense to refer to the work on a point in the PV diagram; work presupposes a path. Other mechanical types of work There are several ways of doing mechanical work, each in some way related to a force acting through a distance.Yunus A. Cengel and Michael A. Boles,Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach 7th Edition, , McGraw-Hill, 2010, In basic mechanics, the work done by a constant force F on a body displaced a distance s in the direction of the force is given by :W = F s \\\\, If the force is not constant, the work done is obtained by integrating the differential amount of work, :W=\\\\int_{1}^{2} F\\\\,ds. =Rotational work= Energy transmission with a rotating shaft is very common in engineering practice. Often the torque T applied to the shaft is constant which means that the force F applied is constant. For a specified constant torque, the work done during n revolutions is determined as follows: A force F acting through a moment arm r generates a torque T :T = F r \\\\,‚ÜíF=\\\\frac{T}{r} This force acts through a distance s, which is related to the radius r by :s = 2\\\\left( r\\\\pi n \\\\right) The shaft work is then determined from: :W_s = F s=2 \\\\pi n T The power transmitted through the shaft is the shaft work done per unit time, which is expressed as :\\\\dot{W}_s=2 \\\\pi T \\\\dot{n} =Spring work= When a force is applied on a spring, and the length of the spring changes by a differential amount dx, the work done is :\\\\partial w_s=F dx For linear elastic springs, the displacement x is proportional to the force applied :F=Kx, where K is the spring constant and has the unit of N/m. The displacement x is measured from the undisturbed position of the spring (that is, X=0 when F=0). Substituting the two equations :W_s=\\\\frac{1}{2} k \\\\left(x_{1}^2-x_{2}^2\\\\right), where x1 and x2 are the initial and the final displacement of the spring respectively, measured from the undisturbed position of the spring. =Work done on elastic solid bars= Solids are often modeled as linear springs because under the action of a force they contract or elongate, and when the force is lifted, they return to their original lengths, like a spring. This is true as long as the force is in the elastic range, that is, not large enough to cause permanent or plastic deformation. Therefore, the equations given for a linear spring can also be used for elastic solid bars. Alternately, we can determine the work associated with the expansion or contraction of an elastic solid bar by replacing the pressure P by its counterpart in solids, normal stress œÉ=F/A in the work expansion :W=\\\\int_{1}^{2} F\\\\,dx. :W=\\\\int_{1}^{2} A \\\\sigma\\\\,dx. where A is the cross sectional area of the bar. =Work associated with the stretching of liquid film= Consider a liquid film such as a soap film suspended on a wire frame. Some force is required to stretch this film by the movable portion of the wire frame. This force is used to overcome the microscopic forces between molecules at the liquid-air interface. These microscopic forces are perpendicular to any line in the surface and the force generated by these forces per unit length is called the surface tension œÉ whose unit is N/m. Therefore, the work associated with the stretching of a film is called surface tension work, and is determined from :W_s=\\\\int_{1}^{2} \\\\sigma_s\\\\,dA. where dA=2b dx is the change in the surface area of the film. The factor 2 is due to the fact that the film has two surfaces in contact with air. The force acting on the moveable wire as a result of surface tension effects is F=2b œÉ, where œÉ is the surface tension force per unit length. Free energy and exergy The amount of useful work which may be extracted from a thermodynamic system is determined by the second law of thermodynamics. Under many practical situations this can be represented by the thermodynamic availability, or Exergy, function. Two important cases are: in thermodynamic systems where the temperature and volume are held constant, the measure of useful work attainable is the Helmholtz free energy function; and in systems where the temperature and pressure are held constant, the measure of useful work attainable is the Gibbs free energy. Non- mechanical forms of work Non-mechanical work in thermodynamics is work determined by long-range forces penetrating into the system as force fields. The action of such forces can be initiated by events in the surroundings of the system, or by thermodynamic operations on the shielding walls of the system. The long-range forces are forces in the ordinary physical sense of the word, not the so-called 'thermodynamic forces' of non-equilibrium thermodynamic terminology. The non-mechanical work of long-range forces can have either positive or negative sign, work being done by the system on the surroundings, or vice versa. Work done by long-range forces can be done indefinitely slowly, so as to approach the fictive reversible quasi-static ideal, in which entropy is not created in the system by the process. In thermodynamics, non-mechanical work is to be contrasted with mechanical work that is done by forces in immediate contact between the system and its surroundings. If the putative 'work' of a process cannot be defined as either long-range work or else as contact work, then sometimes it cannot be described by the thermodynamic formalism as work at all. Nevertheless, the thermodynamic formalism allows that energy can be transferred between an open system and its surroundings by processes for which work is not defined. An example is when the wall between the system and its surrounds is not considered as idealized and vanishingly thin, so that processes can occur within the wall, such as friction affecting the transfer of matter across the wall; in this case, the forces of transfer are neither strictly long-range nor strictly due to contact between the system and its surrounds; the transfer of energy can then be considered as by convection, and assessed in sum just as transfer of internal energy. This is conceptually different from transfer of energy as heat through a thick fluid-filled wall in the presence of a gravitational field, between a closed system and its surroundings; in this case there may convective circulation within the wall but the process may still be considered as transfer of energy as heat between the system and its surroundings; if the whole wall is moved by the application of force from the surroundings, without change of volume of the wall, so as to change the volume of the system, then it is also at the same time transferring energy as work. A chemical reaction within a system can lead to electrical long-range forces and to electric current flow, which transfer energy as work between system and surroundings, though the system's chemical reactions themselves (except for the special limiting case in which in they are driven through devices in the surroundings so as to occur along a line of thermodynamic equilibrium) are always irreversible and do not directly interact with the surroundings of the system.Prigogine, I., Defay, R. (1954). Chemical Thermodynamics, translation by D.H. Everett of the 1950 edition of Thermodynamique Chimique, Longmans, Green & Co., London, p. 43. Non-mechanical work contrasts with pressure‚Äìvolume work. Pressure‚Äìvolume work is one of the two mainly considered kinds of mechanical contact work. A force acts on the interfacing wall between system and surroundings. The force is that due to the pressure exerted on the interfacing wall by the material inside the system; that pressure is an internal state variable of the system, but is properly measured by external devices at the wall. The work is due to change of system volume by expansion or contraction of the system. If the system expands, in the present article it is said to do positive work on the surroundings. If the system contracts, in the present article it is said to do negative work on the surroundings. Pressure‚Äìvolume work is a kind of contact work, because it occurs through direct material contact with the surrounding wall or matter at the boundary of the system. It is accurately described by changes in state variables of the system, such as the time courses of changes in the pressure and volume of the system. The volume of the system is classified as a \\"deformation variable\\", and is properly measured externally to the system, in the surroundings. Pressure‚Äìvolume work can have either positive or negative sign. Pressure‚Äìvolume work, performed slowly enough, can be made to approach the fictive reversible quasi-static ideal. Non-mechanical work also contrasts with shaft work. Shaft work is the other of the two mainly considered kinds of mechanical contact work. It transfers energy by rotation, but it does not eventually change the shape or volume of the system. Because it does not change the volume of the system it is not measured as pressure‚Äìvolume work, and it is called isochoric work. Considered solely in terms of the eventual difference between initial and final shapes and volumes of the system, shaft work does not make a change. During the process of shaft work, for example the rotation of a paddle, the shape of the system changes cyclically, but this does not make an eventual change in the shape or volume of the system. Shaft work is a kind of contact work, because it occurs through direct material contact with the surrounding matter at the boundary of the system. A system that is initially in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium cannot initiate any change in its internal energy. In particular, it cannot initiate shaft work. This explains the curious use of the phrase \\"inanimate material agency\\" by Kelvin in one of his statements of the second law of thermodynamics. Thermodynamic operations or changes in the surroundings are considered to be able to create elaborate changes such as indefinitely prolonged, varied, or ceased rotation of a driving shaft, while a system that starts in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is inanimate and cannot spontaneously do that. Also published in Thus the sign of shaft work is always negative, work being done on the system by the surroundings. Shaft work can hardly be done indefinitely slowly; consequently it always produces entropy within the system, because it relies on friction or viscosity within the system for its transfer.M√ºnster, A. (1970), Classical Thermodynamics, translated by E.S. Halberstadt, Wiley‚ÄìInterscience, London, , p. 45. The foregoing comments about shaft work apply only when one ignores that the system can store angular momentum and its related energy. Examples of non-mechanical work modes include * Electrical work ‚Äì where the force is defined by the surroundings' voltage (the electrical potential) and the generalized displacement is change of spatial distribution of electrical charge * Magnetic work ‚Äì where the force is defined by the surroundings' magnetic field strength and the generalized displacement is change of total magnetic dipole moment * Electrical polarization work ‚Äì where the force is defined by the surroundings' electric field strength and the generalized displacement is change of the polarization of the medium (the sum of the electric dipole moments of the molecules) Gravitational work Gravitational work is defined by force measured in the surroundings' gravitational field. It may cause a generalized displacement in the form of change of the spatial distribution of the matter within the system. The system gains internal energy (or other relevant cardinal quantity of energy, such as enthalpy) through internal friction. As seen by the surroundings, such frictional work appears as mechanical work done on the system, but as seen by the system, it appears as transfer of energy as heat. When the system is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, its temperature is uniform throughout. If the volume and other extensive state variables, apart from entropy, are held constant over the process, then the transferred heat must appear as increased temperature and entropy; in a uniform gravitational field, the pressure of the system will be greater at the bottom than at the top. By definition, the relevant cardinal energy function is distinct from the gravitational potential energy of the system as a whole; the latter may also change as a result of gravitational work done by the surroundings on the system. The gravitational potential energy of the system is a component of its total energy, alongside its other components, namely its cardinal thermodynamic (e.g. internal) energy and its kinetic energy as a whole system in motion.

Once considerably larger, Bickleigh now comprises a group of buildings from various periods which together formed a water castle. The main building was destroyed during the English Civil War, however other buildings, mostly arranged around a central courtyard survived. The castle is frequently open to the public by appointment, but it serves principally as a bespoke wedding venue. The River Exe runs through the grounds. History A Norman motte castle of the late 11th or early 12th century was dismantled in the mid 12th century. During this time a small stone chapel was built in the bailey. In the 15th century the Courtenay family built a mansion on the site and incorporated some of the earlier buildings. The Courtenay and Carew families then lived there until the English Civil War, and the Carews owned the Estate until 1924. During the English Civil War Charles I's queen, Henrietta Maria stayed in the castle as a guest of Sir Henry & Lady Dorothy Carew in 1644, on her way to Exeter. Shortly after her visit she gave birth to Princess Henrietta Anne Stuart, who later married Le Duc d'Orl√©ans, the bisexual brother of King Louis XIV of France; there is a plaque commemorating the birth of the Princess in Exeter, which is now displayed in the Princesshay Shopping Centre. The Queen then exiled herself in July 1644 from Falmouth, and did not return until the 1660s. Subsequently, at the end of 1645, Fairfax's Parliamentarian troops attacked the castle, after 'slighting' neighbouring Tiverton Castle. The bulk of the castellated structure was then demolished by Parliamentarian troops. The 'slighting' of Bickleigh was a response to the Royalist sympathies of the Carew family and its use as a stronghold during the conflict with the main manor house and inner keep being destroyed. Following the Restoration, a typical Devon farmhouse of cob and thatch was added. The buildings subsequently fell into disrepair, and became a farm store and cottage until they were restored early in the 20th century. The Norman chapel and a 12th-century gatehouse still exist, as does the 15th- century Courthouse and parts of the original Norman curtain wall. On a small hill behind the castle, encased amongst rhododendrons, are the remains of the Saxon 'motte' (watchtower). Buildings The west range no longer survives. A building now known as the \\"Old Court\\" is south of the courtyard. Along with the North range and gatehouse most of the buildings were arranged around a central courtyard. The chapel is east of the rest of the buildings close to the River Exe. Moat Cottage is north of the other buildings. =Gatehouse= The gatehouse dates from the early 12th century and is a Grade I listed building. It is a three-storey single-depth plan stone structure with an asbestos slate roof surmounted by turrets. A central carriage archway leads into a courtyard. The building was substantially altered in the 15th century by the Courtenay family, and restored in the 1920s and 1930s during the ownerships of Mr Francis Harper and Lt Col Jasper Henson. The chapel at Bickleigh Castle, reputed to be Saxon The Sanctuary of the chapel pre-dates the Norman additions and alterations. The first documentary evidence of this building is circa AD600 probably before the Saxons arrived circa AD 660, with further documentary reference to it being a chapel circa AD800s. The Sanctuary is the oldest part no doubt altered during that time. There is archeological evidence of a wall at the west end of the Sanctuary with an arch, dividing it from the then nave. This was demolished when the nave was enlarged and replaced with a wooden Rood Screen. The current \\"wagon roof\\" dating from the 15th century. It is often cited as the oldest complete building in Devon. It was substantially renovated in the early 20th century. The rood screen was unfortunately lost during the 19th century when the Chapel was temporarily used to house cattle. The Chapel currently (2017) enjoys the benefit of a recently restored Estey organ dating from 1884. =Old Court= The Old Court is south of the range around the courtyard. It was built in the mid-fifteenth century as a Magistrates' Court for Thomas, the 6th Earl of Devon, who was executed after the Battle of Towton in 1461; however, it has been revised and added to many times and part of the structure may have been demolished. It may have formed a hall house covered by a five arch braced jointed truss cruck roof. After the English Civil War, when the Castle was severely damaged, it became a residence, and may well have had some of the alterations made at that time. It is believed an underground passage connects the Old Court to the Keep Gatehouse at a point in the Keep Gatehouse where a room has been bricked up. =North Range= The North Range was built in the latter half of the 17th century and served as a farmhouse, housing staff for the owner, Sir Henry Carew, Kt. It is a two-storey building with a thatched roof. In the left end room is a 16th-century overmantel (c.1550) carved with scenes relating to the Reformation and specifically the trial and execution of Henry Courtenay, Marquis of Exeter & Earl of Devon, Sir Nicholas Carew, and Henry Pole at the Tower of London in January 1539 following the alleged 'Exeter Conspiracy'; in the carving is a stylised depiction of the City of Exeter and the Inner Keep of Bickleigh Castle. King Henry VIII is also depicted. A part of the carving may also relate to the role of the Carew family in putting down the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549. The building was restored in the 1930s. The carving was originally in the part of the Castle demolished by the Parliamentarian Forces in the Civil War; for safe-keeping, it was stored in the vaults of Exeter Cathedral until the 1930s, when it was returned to the owner, Lt Col Jasper Henson, after a chance conversation with William Cecil, Bishop of Exeter, and eventually installed in its current position. =Moat Cottage= Moat Cottage which stands to the north of the other buildings was constructed in the late 16th century. It is a stone building with a thatched roof. =Stable block= The thatched former stable block was rebuilt in the 19th century on the site of an earlier building. It is surmounted by a turret clock, and has now been converted into accommodation and reception rooms. Grounds It is set in of grounds of which are landscaped. The outer wall, gardens and fish ponds in front of the Keep Gatehouse were landscaped during the ownership of Sir Thomas Carew, Bt., in the 18th Century. The ponds were created from the remnants of the Norman moat. The garden walls, gate piers and gates are also designated as listed buildings. Current use The Castle was open to the public from 1970 to 1990 and was visited by 20,000 people each year. The Castle is currently open to public visitors by prior appointment; guided tours last approximately one hour. The Castle and surrounding buildings are now used principally to host prestigious bespoke Weddings, and also House Parties, Events and Bed & Breakfast.

Along with Jose Altuve, Verlander was also named winner of the Babe Ruth Award as co-MVPs of the 2017 postseason.  2018: 200 career wins, 2,500 strikeouts, Cy Young runner-up  On March 5, 2018, Verlander was named the opening day starter for the Astros. This was his 10th career opening day start and first with Houston. He started and won on March 29 versus Cole Hamels of the Texas Rangers, pitching six shutout innings and striking out five. Unlike in previous seasons, Verlander started masterfully in 2018, leading an Astros rotation that began the season as the most dominant in the major leagues. In April, Verlander went 4‚Äì0 with a 1.36 ERA and 48 strikeouts over 40 innings. He was named the AL Player of the Week on April 17; in 15 innings over two starts that week, he struck out 20 and allowed a .100 opponents' batting average. On May 1, Verlander struck out 14 Yankees, tying his career high, over eight shutout innings in Houston. On May 16, Verlander threw a complete game shutout against the Los Angeles Angels for his eighth career shutout and 24th complete game. He struck out Shohei Ohtani in the top of the ninth inning for his 2,500th career strikeout, becoming the 33rd pitcher in Major League history to reach the milestone. He was second among active leaders in strikeouts behind CC Sabathia. 12 games into the 2018 season, Verlander led the AL in 17 different categories, most notably: ERA (1.11), Wins (7), Innings Pitched (81.1), WAR for pitchers (3.3), WHIP (0.713), H/9 Innings (4.8) and BAA (.153). Verlander was named AL Pitcher of the Month for May, his fifth such award. In six starts, he produced a 0.86 ERA and .437 OPS against, allowed nine extra base hits, while striking out 50 over innings. He started and ended the month by dominating the Yankees‚Äîthe only lineup in baseball with an OPS over .800‚Äîwith 20 strikeouts and only one run allowed in innings. On July 8, Verlander was named to his seventh All-Star Game, and his first with the Astros. However, Verlander made his scheduled start on the Sunday before the All-Star Game, and did not pitch in the game. On August 19, Verlander went innings striking out six and giving up four earned runs in a crucial 9‚Äì4 victory over the Oakland Athletics. The win was Verlander's 200th career win, becoming the 114th pitcher (and third active pitcher) to reach the milestone, and only the 20th pitcher in Major League history to do so in 412 starts or fewer. On September 10, in his first start in Detroit since being traded, Verlander got the win while allowing two runs on six hits in seven innings pitched. He struck out 10 Tigers batters, giving him 258 strikeouts this season. Verlander and Gerrit Cole became the first teammates to strike out at least 250 batters in the same season since Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in 2002. Verlander was given many standing ovations during his outing, and Comerica Park played a tribute video showing highlights of his 13 seasons as a Tiger. Verlander tied his career high of 269 strikeouts in a season with an 11-strikeout performance in a 5‚Äì4 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on September 16. Verlander subsequently set a new career high the next game in a 10‚Äì5 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on September 22. Verlander struck out 11 in six innings while only giving up one hit, stretching his career high to 280 strikeouts. Verlander also helped set a new Major League record for the Astros with their 1,069th strikeout by their starters in a season, breaking the mark set by the Cleveland Indians in 2017. Verlander finished the 2018 season with a 16‚Äì9 record in 214 innings pitched, and posted a 2.52 ERA with a career-high 290 strikeouts. He posted his lowest ERA since his American League MVP and Cy Young Award-winning 2011 season and led the AL in strikeouts for the fifth time in his career. Verlander also led the major leagues with a 0.902 WHIP and a 7.84 strikeouts-to-walks ratio. His 1.6-per-9 IP walk rate was the lowest of his career. He had the highest fly ball percentage among major league pitchers (51.4%).Major League Leaderboards ¬ª 2018 ¬ª Pitchers ¬ª Batted Ball Statistics  FanGraphs Baseball He finished the season with four straight games in which he struck out 10+ batters, giving him a career best 13 games this season with double-digit strikeouts. In Game 1 of the ALDS, Verlander earned the win, allowing two runs in innings and striking out seven against the Cleveland Indians. The Astros earned a three- game sweep over the Indians, and moved on to face the Boston Red Sox in the American League Championship Series. Verlander started and won Game 1 of the ALCS in Fenway Park, allowing two runs and two hits in six innings pitched. Verlander lost Game 5 of the ALCS with his team down three games to one, surrendering four runs in six innings. It marked the first time in his career that he lost a postseason elimination game. In the 2018 AL Cy Young Award voting announced on November 14, Verlander finished second to Blake Snell of the Tampa Bay Rays by 15 points (169‚Äì154). Verlander received 13 first-place votes to Snell's 17. This was Verlander's third Cy Young runner-up finish, and sixth time finishing in the top five. 2019: Third no-hitter, 3,000 strikeouts, second Cy Young award, and World Series On March 24, 2019, Verlander and the Astros agreed on a two-year, $66 million contract extension to keep Verlander with Houston through the 2021 season. Verlander made his 11th career opening day start on March 28, earning a 5‚Äì1 victory against reigning Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell and the Tampa Bay Rays. On June 1, Verlander threw eight innings of one-run ball with eight strikeouts in a 5‚Äì1 win over the Oakland Athletics in Oakland. In doing so, Verlander passed Cy Young on the all-time MLB strikeouts list and finished the night with 2,809 career strikeouts. He struck out seven in his next outing against the Chicago White Sox to move into the top 20 on the all-time strikeouts list, surpassing Mike Mussina's total of 2,813. On June 12, in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers Verlander struck out a career-high 15 batters, 14 of them swinging, in just seven innings. He got a no-decision though as the Astros lost the game in extra innings. On June 18, Verlander struck out eight Cincinnati Reds batters to move past Mickey Lolich for 19th place on the all-time strikeouts list. Verlander was named to the American League All-Star team for the eighth time in his career. At the time of the selection, Verlander had a 10‚Äì3 record, 2.86 ERA, 147 strikeouts, and an MLB-leading 0.794 WHIP. Verlander was selected as the starting pitcher for the All-Star game for the second time in his career on July 9. He pitched one inning and retired all three batters he faced, two on strikeouts. On July 30, Verlander struck out 13 batters over 7 innings of two-hit ball in a 2‚Äì0 victory over the Cleveland Indians in Cleveland. The win was his first in Cleveland since June 21, 2014 and his fourth consecutive win in his last four starts. He also surpassed 2,900 career strikeouts in the game, finishing his night at 2,902. On August 4, Verlander struck out 10 batters over 6 innings in a 3‚Äì1 win over the Seattle Mariners. With the 10-K performance, Verlander surpassed 200 strikeouts in a season for the ninth time in his career. He joined Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens, Tom Seaver, Pedro Martinez, and Bob Gibson as the only pitchers with 9 or more seasons of 200+ strikeouts. All but Clemens and Verlander are in the Hall of Fame. On August 16, Verlander struck out 11 batters over 7 innings against the Oakland A's. It was his sixth consecutive start with 10+ strikeouts, setting an Astros franchise record and becoming the first pitcher to achieve this since Max Scherzer and Chris Sale in 2017. In combination with his prior start against the Baltimore Orioles on August 11, Verlander now has more strikeouts than innings pitched in his career. On August 21, Verlander lost to the Detroit Tigers, 2‚Äì1 even though he did not allow any walks and only two hits, both of them solo home runs over nine innings. He is the only pitcher other than Mike Mussina (1998) known to have pitched a complete game loss without ever throwing a pitch with a runner on base. Verlander also had 11 strikeouts in the game, the seventh straight game in which he recorded double-digit strikeouts. On September 1, in a road game against the Toronto Blue Jays, Verlander threw his third career no-hitter. He allowed one base-runner, a walk to Cavan Biggio in the first inning, and struck out 14 batters. The Astros' only runs came on a two-run home run by Abraham Toro in the top of the ninth inning. This was Verlander's second career no-hitter against the Blue Jays making him just the third pitcher of the modern era to no-hit the same team twice, and the first to pitch both no hitters against the same team on the road. He is the sixth pitcher ever to throw three or more no-hitters in their career. On September 28, in his final start of the 2019 regular season, Verlander struck out Kole Calhoun in the bottom of the 4th inning against the Los Angeles Angels for his 3,000th career strikeout becoming the 18th pitcher in history to strike out 3,000 hitters. Verlander struck Calhoun out again in the bottom of the 6th for his 300th strikeout of the season, a new career high. Verlander and teammate Gerrit Cole became the first pair of starting pitchers to strike out 300+ hitters in the same season since Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling achieved the feat in 2002 for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Verlander finished the 2019 season 21‚Äì6 with 300 strikeouts and a 2.58 ERA in 223 innings pitched. He finished first in MLB in innings pitched and games started for the fourth time in his career, first in wins for the third time in his career, and first in WHIP for the third time in his career. His 0.803 WHIP was the lowest in a major league season since Pedro Mart√≠nez posted a 0.737 WHIP in 2000. Verlander also led the American League with a 7.14 strikeouts- to-walks ratio. He was also first in MLB in WAR for pitchers (7.8) and lowest hits per nine innings (5.529). Batters hit .171 against him, the lowest batting average in the major leagues, and his left on base percentage of 88.4% was the best in the majors. He allowed the highest fly ball percentage of all major league pitchers (45.2%), which contributed to a career-high 36 home runs allowed. During the top of the second inning of game 2 of the 2019 World Series, Verlander recorded the 200th postseason strikeout of his career setting a new major league record and surpassing the previous record of 199 set by John Smoltz. He finished the game with six strikeouts, seven hits and four earned runs in six innings in a 12‚Äì3 loss to the Washington Nationals. With the loss, he became the first pitcher in major league history to lose his first five World Series decisions. On November 12, 2019, Verlander won his second Cy Young Award receiving 171 points and 17 of 30 first place votes to top teammate Gerrit Cole (159 points, 13 first place votes). It was also the first time he received the award while playing for the Houston Astros.https://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/mlb-awards-astros-justin-verlander- wins-al-cy-young-award-over-teammate-gerrit-cole/ 2020 On March 17, 2020, Verlander underwent surgery on his right groin that required six weeks to recover. At around the same time, the season was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 26, 2020, it was reported that Verlander would be shut down with a forearm strain. On September 19, Verlander confirmed via his Instagram account that he would undergo Tommy John surgery and would miss the remainder of the 2020 season plus all of the 2021 season as well. The operation has him sidelined until the end of his current Astros contract.Verlander underwent the procedure on September 30, 2020. Pitching style Verlander throws four pitches: a hard four-seam fastball averaging 94‚Äì95 mph (topping out at 102), a slider in the mid-to-high 80s, a 12‚Äì6 curveball around 80, and a changeup at 85‚Äì88 mph. His four-seam fastball has an \\"elite\\" spin rate of over 2500 rpm according to Statcast, giving it a late \\"tailing\\" action that cuts inside to righties and away from lefties. He often uses his four-seam fastball up in the zone to hitters. This has allowed him to strike out more batters with that pitch than any others. His slider has evolved throughout his career. In his early years, his slider was in the mid-80s with a larger break. However, in recent years, Verlander has added velocity to his slider. This change has caused a later, sharper break that has led many to believe it is actually a cutter, although Verlander has denied this on various occasions. In 2017, Verlander began to incorporate both sliders. He usually throws the slower, longer slider under the hands of lefties, and the sharper, faster slider down and away to righties. His 12‚Äì6 curveball has always been a dominant pitch that buckles hitters' knees at any point in the count. He also intentionally uses this pitch up in the zone at times to freeze hitters or throw off their timing. Since the 2016 season, Verlander has essentially become a three-pitch pitcher (fastball, slider, curveball). His changeup has been used almost exclusively against left-handed batters in recent years, and its usage has dropped considerably. The changeup accounted for 8.5 percent of his pitches in 2016, only 4 percent of his pitches in 2017, and less than 2 percent of his pitches in 2018. Verlander is known for his unusual ability to \\"add\\" and \\"subtract\\" from his fastball velocity at any point in the game, giving him the ability to throw it in the upper 90s even in the late innings of games. Since 2008, Verlander has thrown pitches of over 100+ mph in the 8th inning or later 44 times, 39 more times than James Paxton who is second on the list. This is despite the fact that he has thrown the most pitches in the major leagues since the beginning of the 2008 season. After a couple of injury prone seasons, many believed Verlander had lost the velocity most fans had grown accustomed to. However, Verlander's velocity soared back up to an average of 95.3 in his 2017 campaign, 4 miles per hour faster than his average in 2014 (91.2), and 3 MPH faster than his average in 2015 (92.3). Verlander's average fastball velocity with no strikes is 94.7 mph, while with two strikes it is 97.0 mph. Due to the changing nature of how pitchers are used in baseball, Verlander is considered by many to be the last of the old school power pitchers. He is also considered to be a higher-than average fly ball pitcher. Throughout his career, Verlander has consistently been near or at the top of the league in innings pitched, leading the league in 2009, 2011,2012, and 2019. He has finished in the Top 10 in innings pitched 9 times (2009‚Äì13, 2016‚Äì19) and has the most 200+ innings pitched seasons of any current player with 11. His power pitching frequently leads to high strikeout totals. He is a five-time American League strikeout champion (2009, 2011, 2012, 2016 and 2018), and led all of major league baseball in three of those five seasons (2009, 2011 and 2012). He has fanned over 3,000 batters in his career, one of only 18 pitchers in history to reach that total. Following the 2019 retirement of CC Sabathia, Verlander is now the only active pitcher with at least 3,000 career strikeouts. Charity work In 2016, Verlander started the \\"Wins For Warriors Foundation\\" for veterans of the United States military. The \\"Wins For Warriors Foundation\\" campaign raised $246,311 to help Houston recover from Hurricane Harvey in 2017. To date, Verlander has donated over 1 million dollars to this cause. Verlander has also supported various local Detroit charities for the impoverished as well as helping out with national efforts such as the Red Cross. Personal life Verlander with wife Kate Upton (left) in 2019 Verlander grew up in Manakin- Sabot, Virginia with his parents, Theodore and Kathy Verlander and a younger brother, Ben Verlander. His life experiences and the story of his development are outlined in his parents' 2012 book, Rocks Across the Pond: Lessons Learned, Stories Told. His younger brother, Ben played for the Tigers organization as an outfielder. Ben was released on June 23, 2017. Verlander started dating model-actress Kate Upton in early 2014, and in 2016 the couple got engaged. In the 2014 iCloud leaks of celebrity photos, many of Verlander's personal pictures including nude pictures of both himself and Upton, as well as other women, were leaked online. On November 4, 2017, two days after he won the World Series with the Astros, the two married in a medieval church in Tuscany, Italy overlooking the Montalcino valley. On July 14, 2018, they announced that Kate was pregnant with their first child. The couple had a daughter, Genevieve later that year. During the off-season, Verlander lives in Los Angeles.

As a small boy, his family moved to Maisons- Laffitte where his father worked at the local race track. There, at a young age Pierre Bellocq used his natural talent to begin creating caricatures of horses and horse people. At age 19, the French racing journal France Courses gave him national exposure when they published one of his cartoons of a jockey. Bellocq signed the drawing as \\"Peb\\", a signature which would become his lifelong moniker. Within a few years Peb was widely known and an emerging artist who also gained recognition for his caricatures on sports advertising posters. Career By 1954, Bellocq's work had achieved international recognition and he was contracted by Laurel Park owner John D. Schapiro to do drawings for the inaugural running of the Washington, D.C. International Stakes. He settled in the United States and in early 1955 accepted an offer to work as the staff cartoonist for the Morning Telegraph newspaper and its sister paper, the Daily Racing Form, a job he held until December 2008. Pierre Bellocq has produced several books; his first consisted of 150 cartoons and was titled Peb's Equine Comedy. It was published by Random House in 1957 and is still in print. As well, he did the illustrations for the 1969 Joe Hirsch book A Treasury of Questions and Answers from the Morning Telegraph and Daily Racing Form. In 2004, he created drawings for author Ed Hotaling's book on jockey Jimmy Winkfield whom Bellocq had known personally when the African American rider was living and racing in his hometown of Maisons-Laffitte, France. He received the National Cartoonists Society 1991 Sports Cartoon Award and their 1999 Newspaper Illustration Award. In 1998, the Daniel Wildenstein Art Gallery in New York held an exhibition of Bellocq's work titled \\"The Racing World in Sketch and Caricature.\\" From July 24, 2004 until December 31, 2005, the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame put on a special exhibition of his works titled \\"Peb: The Art of Humor\\" that celebrated his 50th anniversary of horse racing artwork in the United States. In 2001, when Churchill Downs began its major renovations, one of the additions to the clubhouse was a 36-foot mural by Pierre Bellocq depicting all 96 jockeys who had won the Kentucky Derby from 1875 to 2004. Another Bellocq mural, in the clubhouse of Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, depicts the dominant jockeys, trainers and racing personalities of the track's century-long history.

He began by working as a roadie in Australia in the early 1970s to managing pop, rock performers including Sherbet (1970 ‚Äì 79), Olivia Newton-John (1979 ‚Äì 1986), Tina Turner (1981 to date), James Reyne (1986 ‚Äì 1990), Tony Joe White (1989 ‚Äì 2000), Dalbello (1984), Cher (1999 to date), Janet Jackson (1989 ‚Äì 2002), Joe Cocker (1991 to date), Sade (1991 to date), M People (1997 ‚Äì 2000), and Pink (2001 to date).  Biography  Roger Davies was born in 1952 and grew up in Melbourne. In 1970 he left university to become a roadie for a progressive rock band, Company Caine. In the following year he relocated to Sydney and worked for a booking agency, Consolidated Rock ‚Äì set up by Michael Browning and Michael Gudinski. In October 1972, with a fellow work mate, Michael Chugg, he set up Sunrise booking agency. = Sherbet= Davies became the talent manager for pop-rock group, Sherbet; he was impressed by the group's attitude: their \\"willingness to work anywhere, anytime, whatever it took.\\" According to musicologist, Ian McFarlane, \\"Under the direction of astute manager Roger Davies, the band also pioneered the concept of the national rock tour by undertaking arduous, cross-country treks to play in the far-flung corners of the continent. Sherbet's carefully cultivated image tended to alienate the 'serious' music fan, although the band's ability to deliver well-crafted pop music has never been in doubt.\\". Unusually for the time, Sherbet, under Davies‚Äô direction, the band established its own record label, publishing company and merchandising company. With no previous management experience, Davies proceeded along the path he perceived successful English bands to have taken. Starting the record label was a major innovation and for a band to have a merchandising company was ahead of its time. Sherbet evolved from a soul-based covers band into a teen-oriented pop, rock outfit that relied mostly on original material. They had eleven singles peak in the Australian top ten. Note: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1974 until Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) created their own charts in mid-1988. In 1992, Kent back calculated chart positions for 1970‚Äì1974. From 1975 Davies and Sherbet turned their attention to the international market. The single, \\"Howzat\\" (1976), was inspired by the sport of cricket, which went to number one in Australia, and New Zealand. It was a Top 10 hit in several European countries ‚Äì including number four on the UK Singles Chart, It had less chart success in the United States where it reached No. 61 on the Billboard Hot 100. Nevertheless, its success led to an extensive international tour from 1976 to 1977. The group's foray into the US market began in 1977 with their album, Photoplay, retitled, Magazine, which failed to chart there. They signed with RSO Records and changed their name to Highway but still had no US charting with the subsequent album, Highway 1 (1978). In mid-1979 the group disbanded and Davies remained in the US; the band returned to Australia and reformed as the Sherbs in 1980. = Olivia Newton-John = In 1978 in the US Roger Davies became the manager for Steve Kipner (ex-Steve and the Board, Tin Tin), a singer-songwriter, who had been in Australia during the 1960s. Davies also worked for Olivia Newton-John's then-manager, Lee Kramer. Kipner had co-written \\"Physical\\" for Tina Turner, another of Kramer's clients, who thought it \\"too obvious\\" and rejected it. Davies and Kramer heard Kipner's demo and decided they would offer it to Newton-John. She recorded it, but felt the lyrics were \\"too rude to release.\\" In 1981 Davies took over Newton-John's management following her split with Kramer. In September 1981 \\"Physical\\" was issued and provided Newton-John with an international hit including staying at the top of the US charts for ten weeks. Davies helped continue her commercial success during the early 1980s, including her studio albums, Physical (October 1981) and Soul Kiss (October 1985), and her North American Physical Tour (1982). In April 2018 the Australian television bio-pic Olivia Newton-John: Hopelessly Devoted To You featured Delta Goodrem as Olivia Newton, and Gyton Grantley as manager Roger Davies. = Tina Turner = In 1980 Roger Davies' employer Lee Kramer became the manager of singer, Tina Turner. Turner had divorced her husband, Ike, in March 1978 and by 1979 was without a record contract. To support herself, Turner had worked on the club circuit, It was on the set of Olivia Newton-John's ABC TV Special ‚ÄúHollywood Nights‚Äù that Davies first met Tina Turner. Davies and Kramer saw her perform live at the Fairmont Hotel, San Francisco in February 1980; where \\"She said 'I want to get out of here and play rock venues'.\\" Turner asked Kramer to be her manager and Davies reluctantly went along with the plan. Davies used his industry contacts to put together a comeback and by 1981 he was Turner's manager. Davies advised Turner to drop her cabaret ensemble and remodel her show into a grittier rock'n'roll showcase. Turner's return to popularity began in the United Kingdom with a cover version of The Temptations' \\"Ball of Confusion\\" (1982), and was followed by a cover of Al Green's \\"Let's Stay Together\\" (November 1983), which was a hit in Europe. Her major breakthrough came with \\"What's Love Got to Do with It\\" (June 1984), a track written by Terry Britten (ex-The Twilights) and Graham Lyle. Turner had disliked the song and originally turned it down, but despite her reservations, it provided her with her first US number-one hit on 1 September 1984. In August 1984, Davies booked Turner at The Ritz in New York City for a series of three gigs reviewed as \\"a hip-shaking, knee- swinging rendition of a rock song, she pauses for a deep, sweeping, bow, delivered with a diva's hauteur\\". Her single, \\"Private Dancer\\" (October), (penned by Mark Knopfler) was an international hit and the related album Private Dancer became one of the biggest successes of the 1980s, earning Turner three Grammy Awards in 1985, and re-establishing her as one of the world's top rock performers. Turner accepted the role of \\"Aunty Entity\\" in the Australian film, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (July 1985). In 1993 What's Love Got to Do with It, a biopic about Turner by Kurt Loder, was filmed with Angela Bassett in the lead role and Australian singer-actor James Reyne (former lead singer of Australian Crawl) portraying DaviesMcFarlane, 'James Reyne' entry. Archived from the original on 6 August 2004. Retrieved 16 October 2015. ‚Äì however it was Kramer who should have been depicted at that point of her career. Davies was satirically portrayed by Alec Baldwin in a sketch on Saturday Night Live when Turner guested on the program on 22 February 1997. = James Reyne = Whilst managing Tina Turner, Davies was also the manager of Australian-based singer- songwriter James Reyne, known for his work in the rock band Australian Crawl. The eponymous album James Reyne was released on 1987 Capitol Records, with Olivia Newton-John credited on guest vocals. Hard Reyne was the follow up album released 29 May 1989 also on Capitol Records. Reyne later played the part of Roger Davies in the movie of Tina Turner's life-story, the semi- autobiographical 1993 film \\"What‚Äôs Love Got To Do With It\\". Years later, the American artist, Pink, saw the film and asked her record label to \\"arrange a meeting with the guy who managed Tina as she wanted him to manager her\\". In 2001 Davies became Pink's manager. = Tony Joe White = In 1989 Davies was approached by various artists for artist management, and with Tina Turner's career consolidated, Davies took on a few more acts. He agreed to manage the blues singer/songwriter Tony Joe White from Louisiana, who worked with Tina Turner on the four songs he had written for the 1989 \\"Foreign Affair\\" album. Davies negotiated a record contract with Polydor for Tony Joe and co-produced three albums; 1991's Closer to the Truth, 1993 The Path of a Decent Groove, and 1995 Lake Placid Blues. Tony Joe White is also credited on Joe Cocker's 1996 album Organic, for the songs Heart Full of Rain, and High Lonesome Blue. = Janet Jackson = Davies was then approached by US lawyer, Don Passman, to manage Janet Jackson who at the time was a successful MTV artist being managed by her father. As Tina Turner had moved to Europe and was wanting to slow down, Davies agreed to manage Janet Jackson, confident he could take her to a new level. The first project they worked on was the \\"Rhythm Nation 1814\\" album and tour. The record on A&M; Records was ambitious, with a social slant, very different to what Janet had done before. It reached #1 on the US Billboard 200 and was certified six times platinum, eventually selling 14 million copies worldwide. It was certified the #1 selling album of the year in 1990 winning multiple music awards and the corresponding video won a Grammy. The subsequent \\"Rhythm Nation\\" tour, the artist's first ever tour, became the most successful debut tour by any recording artist. It played to over two million people, grossing $28 million in the US. In 1991, following the success of Rhythm Nation 1814, Davies negotiated a highly publicised multimillion-dollar contract with Virgin Records, citing Janet the highest paid female recording artist in contemporary music. The following year Janet recorded her next album \\"Janet\\" released 1993, it debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and the album's #1 hit single \\"That‚Äôs the Way Love Goes\\" won a Grammy award for Best R & B song. The album was certified six times platinum, with worldwide sales of 20 million copies. The album entitled \\"Janet\\" was released in May 1993. The record opened at number one on the Billboard 200 and was certified six times platinum, selling over 20 million copies worldwide. The lead single \\"That‚Äôs the Way Love Goes\\" won the Grammy Award for Best R&B; Song and topped the Billboard Hot 100 for eight consecutive weeks. In 1997 Davies launched the \\"Velvet Rope\\" album, which reached top five status on global record charts. It debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 and was certified triple platinum. Janet embarked on \\"The Velvet Rope Tour\\", selling out stadiums across North America, Europe Japan, Australia and NZ. The concert was filmed for an HBO broadcast and received over 15 million viewers, surpassing the ratings of the four major networks and winning an Emmy for outstanding technical direction/camera work. The show was a massive production of theatrics and pyrotechnics and the video, produced by Davies, has been judged by multiple critics to portray the most influential choreography and setting of any music video, achieving legendary status. The album \\"All for You\\" was released in April 2001. It entered at #1 on the Billboard 200 with 605,000 copies sold, the highest first-week sales of her career. The title song broke the overall airplay debut record with a first week audience of seventy million. It topped the Hot 100 for seven weeks, also reaching the top ten in eleven countries. The album was certified double platinum, selling nine million copies worldwide. In July 2001, Janet embarked on the All for You Tour, and on the final date, in Hawaii, the show was filmed and broadcast as a concert special for HBO drawing an audience of twelve million viewers. The special was nominated for an Emmy Award and the subsequent video was a major hit, reaching #1 in Australia. Having sold over 100 million records, Janet Jackson is ranked as one of the best-selling artists in the history of contemporary music. In 2016 Billboard magazine released its list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, placing her at number seven. = Dalbello = Roger Davies became the manager of Canadian singer- songwriter, Dalbello (aka Lisa Dal Bello), after she had released her fourth album, whomanfoursays (1984). For that album she had worked with Mick Ronson (David Bowie) as producer and musician. Davies preferred to work with other UK-based producers as he previously had a negative meeting with Ronson at an interview for production work for Tina Turner. According to Sam Lederman (Ronson's then-manager) \\"We met with Tina and Roger all day but Mick got tongue-tied, he just couldn't explain what he wanted to do.\\" Dalbello started to record with Rupert Hine producing,\\"'Renaissance' rock star puts on his thinking cap\\". Toronto Star, 5 September 1986. but Davies \\"vetoed the project and suggested that she look for another producer who might be more commercial.\\" Dalbello provided demo versions of new material, which she had self-produced under an anagramatic pseudonym, Bill da' Salleo. The ruse convinced Davies and the label, A&R;, to approve da' Salleo as the producer for an album. Eventually Davies was told that Dalbello herself had produced the album, he \\"began to question the strength of the album's production and commercial viability.\\" The project was delayed, and finally issued as she in 1987 supported by the music video 'Tango'. = Sade = Davies added the British band Sade to his management stable after an approach from the band's lawyer in London in March 1991. The first album under Davies‚Äô management was Love Deluxe, the band's fourth album released in 1992. It hit top 10 in several countries and achieved quadruple platinum status in the US. The album was the basis for the Love Deluxe tour and the single \\"No Ordinary Love\\" won a Grammy Award for best R & B performance. The album has sold over 7,000,000 copies. Sade then released \\"The Best of Sade\\" on 31 October 1994, going quadruple platinum in the US went on to sell 11,708,000 copies. November 2000 the album, Lovers Rock, was released as the band's fifth studio album, achieving triple platinum status and winning the Grammy Award for best pop vocal album in 2002. A successful North American tour followed. After another extended break, Sade's sixth studio album Soldier of Love was released February 2010. It debuted at #1 in 16 countries including the US where it remained at number one of the Billboard charts for three weeks, then certified double platinum. The title track won the Grammy Award for Best R&B; performance by a group. In May 2011 the band's second compilation album was released, The Ultimate Collection, and Davies took the band on the road for the first time in 11 years. The \\"Soldier of Love Tour\\", was a state of the art production for 21 arena dates in Europe, starting in Nice, France on 29 April 2011, followed by 54 dates in North America, as well as playing arena dates in Chile, Argentina, and Brazil. Demand was such that the band returned to Europe for a further 15 shows, and wound up the year with dates in Australia, New Zealand, and a final date at the Yas Arena, Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates on Friday 16 December 2011. The band have not performed since their tour finished. = Pink = Davies has enjoyed continuing success with American singer-songwriter Pink. He took over her management commencing from her second album, 2001's Missundaztood where the written album credits RD Worldwide Management. Pink was unhappy with her direction and reportedly had little control over her first album, so she enlisted the help of singer- songwriter Linda Perry (4 Non Blondes) for her next and personal second album. Davies had been impressed enough with Pink's presence in her first video to review her debut album (which he reportedly did not like), but when he heard some of the early songs Pink wrote with Perry he was intrigued; \\"She not only sang the tracks, but she acted them out.\\" \\"She said, 'This song is going to be the first single, and this is how the video should be.' By then I knew I wanted to manage her. I told her that she was taking a huge risk by changing her sound, but she knew that. She was just fearless.\\" Davies' and Pink's determination paid off. Her second album proved a tremendous hit, with worldwide sales of over 16 million, winning over critics and fans alike and earning Pink two Grammy nominations, and the single Get the Party Started became a Top Five US hit. Pink's 2003 third album Try This sold over 3 million copies worldwide, and earned Pink her second Grammy Award for her song Trouble, Roger Davies is listed in the management credits, and within the executive producers. Her fourth album, 2006's I'm Not Dead, sold over 6 million copies worldwide, the album credits include \\"Roger Davies, you are a force, a treat to be around. Thank you for your energy and support\\". The tour of the same name smashed attendance records in Australia and Europe for a solo female artist. In 2009, Pink's fifth album Funhouse outsold her \\"I'm Not Dead\\" album and produced the hit singles \\"So What\\" and \\"Sober\\". Within the album credits Davies is mentioned \\"Roger, when I think of you, I automatically feel better, safer, and smarter, and full of love and gratitude. Thank you for that. I feel like I won the lottery with you\\". Her Funhouse Tour played to over two million people at 160 sold-out arena dates worldwide, and in 2010, she followed it up with her Funhouse Summer Carnival Tour, playing 34 European stadium and festival shows in 14 countries in 12 weeks, adding a further one million fans. Pink's seventh album The Truth about Love included 5 hit singles and a sold out worldwide tour. Album seven, Beautiful Trauma, album which included the hit single What About Us, lists Davies along with P!nk as Executive Producers, and within the liner notes written by Pink includes: \\"Thank you Roger Davies, for being a sounding board, a coach, a mentor, a priest, and a friend. My life is made up of memories and you are a huge part of my highlight reel, and even though you don't like to be in the picture, you're standing not far from all them. This is where it's at, at least it fucking used to be.\\" The album released October 2017 was number one over eight countries. Pink's eighth studio album, Hurts 2B Human, was released April 2019, the back page of the artwork booklet lists many thanks including \\"Roger Davies, I love you with all my heart\\". The album's lead single, \\"Walk Me Home\\" was released on 20 February 2019. On the release date, Pink performed the song alongside a medley of her biggest hits at the BRIT Awards, including \\"Try\\", \\"Just Give Me a Reason\\" and \\"What About Us\\". She was also awarded with the Outstanding Contribution to Music Award at the ceremony.

The blast and collapse trapped 13 miners for nearly two days; only one survived.Dao, James (January 4, 2006). \\"12 Miners Found Alive 41 Hours After Explosion\\", nytimes.com; accessed May 27, 2016. It was the worst mining disaster in the United States since the Jim Walter Resources Mine disaster in Alabama on September 23, 2001, and the worst disaster in West Virginia since the 1968 Farmington Mine disaster. It was exceeded four years later by the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster, also a coal mine explosion in West Virginia, which killed 29 miners in April 2010. The disaster received extensive news coverage worldwide. After mining officials released incorrect information, many media outlets initially reported, erroneously, that 12 of the miners survived. Background =Mine ownership= Anker West Virginia Mining was listed as the permittee for the Sago Mine. Testifying before U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) on March 23, 2006, Vice President Sam Kitts described the corporate structure as follows, \\"Sago is part of Wolf Run Mining Company, which is a subsidiary of Hunter Ridge Mining Company. Hunter Ridge is a subsidiary of ICG, Inc.\\" International Coal Group, Inc. was formed in May 2004 by investor Wilbur Ross, who led a group that bought many of Horizon Natural Resources' assets in a bankruptcy auction. The company produces coal from 12 mining complexes in Northern and Central Appalachia (Kentucky, Maryland, and West Virginia) and from one complex in the Illinois basin. Ross, originally operating as Newcoal LLC with four other investors, expressed interest in buying Horizon's nonunion properties, but not its six union operations. According to the Associated Press, Horizon was then allowed to sever its union contracts, including pension benefits, by bankruptcy court. In March 2005, ICG agreed to buy Anker Coal Group, Inc. =Prior inspection history= In 2005, the mine was cited by MSHA 208 times for violating regulations, up from 68 in 2004. Of those, 96 were considered S&S; (significant/serious and substantial).MSHA. Mine Data Retrieval System. Use \\"4608791\\" for the mine ID number. The Charleston Gazette said \\"Sago mine has a history of roof falls\\". MSHA found 52 violations from April to June, of which 31 were \\"serious and substantial\\" (S&S;). From early July to late September, MSHA found 70 violations, 42 of which were S&S.; MSHA inspections from early October to late December resulted in 46 citations and three orders, 18 of which were S&S.; Violations include failure to follow the approved roof control and mine ventilation plans and problems concerning emergency escapeways and required pre-shift safety examinations. The Gazette article explained that \\"S&S;\\" violations are those that MSHA believes are likely to cause an accident that would seriously injure a miner. Originally, MSHA reported on its website that none of the violations were considered \\"immediate risk of injury\\" and that all but three violations, related to shoring up the roof, were corrected by the time of the accident. But the current posting says, \\"Of the 208 citations, orders and safeguards issued in 2005, several involved significant violations that were the result of high negligence and MSHA ordered that mining cease in the affected area until the unsafe condition was addressed.Sago Mine Accident - General Questions and Answers, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) - U.S. Department of Labor; posted January 21, 2006. However, fewer than half of the overall citations against Sago Mine in 2005 were for \\"significant and substantial\\" violations‚Äîand all but eight of the overall citations have been corrected by the operator. The eight remaining issues were being abated by the operator in compliance with the abatement provisions of the Mine Act. \\"Mining operations at the Sago Mine more than doubled between 2004 and 2005, and the injury rate was significantly above the national average. This prompted MSHA to dramatically increase‚Äîby 84%‚Äîits on- site inspection and enforcement presence. As a result, MSHA also took significantly more enforcement actions‚Äî208 in total‚Äîagainst Sago Mine in 2005, requiring the operator to quickly correct health and safety violations in accordance with federal Mine Act standards.\\" Davitt McAteer, Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety during the Clinton administration, told The Gazette, \\"The numbers don‚Äôt sound good....[they are] sufficiently high that it should tip off management that there is something amiss here. For a small operation, that is a significant number of violations.\\" McAteer said the roof fall frequency \\"suggests that the roof is bad and that the support system is not meeting the needs of the roof.\\" On January 3, 2006, Bruce Watzman of the National Mining Association, interviewed by Tom Foreman for Anderson Cooper 360, was asked whether any of the violations \\"leaps out at you as endangering miners' lives?\\" Watzman explained that they could be \\"paperwork errors [or] reporting errors. A lot of violations, but many of which were not significant to really impact miner safety.\\" By contrast, a report in Christian Science Monitor on January 6, 2006, quotes McAteer as saying \\"Sago raises red flags for mine oversight ... If you have a widespread practice of S&S; violations over an extended period of time like we have here, it suggests that you've got much more serious problems than just paperwork violations\\". Relying on MSHA records, Ellen Smith, the editor of Mine Safety and Health News, comments on her publication's website in an article, Sago Mine Facts that \\"Sago's accident rate was 17.04 for 2005, with 16 miners and contractors injured on the job. Sago‚Äôs accident rate was 15.90 in 2004 when the national average was 5.66. \\"Compare this accident rate to another small mine in West Virginia, Kingston Mining No. 1 Mine, which had an accident rate of 1.21 in 2005.\\" Explosion The explosion occurred at approximately 6:30 a.m. ET at the beginning of the first shift after the mine reopened after the New Year's holiday weekend. An examination conducted at 5:50 am by a mine fire boss had cleared the mine for use. Two carts of miners were making their way into the mine to begin work. =Early theories of cause= Early reports noted that there was a thunderstorm in the area at the time and suggested a lightning strike near the mine entrance may have ignited methane, but no one reported seeing such a strike. Sensors from the U.S. National Lightning Detection Network indicated there were at least two cloud-to-ground lightning strikes near the mine. Another early theory was that lightning struck a methane well that had previously been drilled from the surface to an area behind the seals. Methane wells are used to extract methane from coal seams and sometimes from sealed areas when methane levels are high. Storm systems are accompanied by low atmospheric pressure, which causes more methane to escape from coal seams and sealed areas. In winter the air is drier and less dense and creates a drier mine environment. Such conditions have been known to contribute to past mine fires and explosions. Other factors affecting methane liberation include whether the mine ventilation system is exhausting (negative pressure) or blowing (positive pressure), and the operating pressures of the fans. Fourteen men on the second cart escaped the initial explosion. The 12 trapped miners were on the first cart, which apparently passed the point where the explosion occurred. The foreman on the second cart, whose brother was among those trapped, the mine superintendent and three others entered the mine to rescue the trapped miners. They reached into the mine before air quality detectors indicated there was too much carbon monoxide to proceed. In addition, repairs they had made to ventilation controls raised fears that increased fresh air to the interior of the mine may cause a second explosion. =Victims= Of the thirteen miners, Randal L. McCloy Jr., 26, was the only survivor from those trapped at the Sago mine. He was removed from the site at approximately 1:30 a.m. on January 4, and transported to St. Joseph's Hospital (Buckhannon, West Virginia). After being stabilized there, McCloy was transported by ambulance later that morning to a level 1 trauma center at West Virginia University's Ruby Memorial Hospital, away in Morgantown. He was found to be suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning, a collapsed lung, brain hemorrhaging, edema, muscle injury, faulty liver and heart function. On the evening of January 5, McCloy was transferred to Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh to receive infusions of oxygen in a hyperbaric chamber to counteract the effects of carbon monoxide. On January 7, he returned to Ruby Memorial Hospital where he remained in a coma. On January 18, doctors reported McCloy was showing signs of gradual awakening. On January 25, doctors reported McCloy was emerging from the coma, but was still unable to talk. On January 26, 2006, West Virginia Hospitals announced that McCloy had been transferred from Ruby Memorial to its HealthSouth Mountainview Regional Rehabilitation Hospital in Morgantown, and was under the care of a rehabilitation specialist. He was responsive, could eat, but was still unable to talk. McCloy recovered almost fully after months of physical therapy, but he stated he still suffered from some vision and hearing impairment as well as weakness on the right side of his body. Private funerals for the 12 deceased miners were held on January 8 to 10, 2006. A public memorial service was held on January 15 for them at West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon. More than 2,000 attended the service, which was televised live on CNN. Among the speakers were Governor Joe Manchin and author and West Virginia native Homer Hickam. Both of West Virginia's U.S. senators, Robert Byrd and Jay Rockefeller, and U.S. Representative Shelley Capito also attended, but did not speak. Rescue It was reported that the early hours after the blast were chaotic and the mining company did not call a specialized mine rescue crew until 8:04 a.m. ‚Äî more than 90 minutes after the blast. The company notified MSHA at 8:30. The company said it started its calls at 7:40. MSHA records two calls at 8:10 to personnel who were out of town due to the holiday. MSHA personnel arrived on site at approximately 10:30 am. The first rescue crew arrived ten minutes later. High levels of carbon monoxide (CO) and methane gas in the mine atmosphere made it necessary for rescuers to wait 12 hours after the explosion to begin to reach the miners. Tests taken through holes drilled from the surface showed that the air near where the miners were last known to be stationed contained 1,300 parts per million of CO. More than 200 parts per million is considered unsafe. However, each miner had a Self-Contained Self-Rescuer (SCSR) device that provided one hour of breathable air. Emergency supplies were stored in 55-gallon drums (205 L drums) within the mine. Even after the gases abated, rescue teams had to proceed with caution, continually testing for hazards such as water seeps, explosive gas concentrations, and unsafe roof conditions. This limited their rate of progress to an hour. They checked in every , and then disconnected their telephones until the next checkpoint in order to avoid the possibility of a spark creating another explosion. MSHA had deployed a 1,300-lb. (520 kg) robot into the mine as well, but pulled it out after it became mired from the mine entrance. After more than nine hours of searching, rescue teams pulled out of the mine at about 3:40 a.m. Tuesday, January 3. Through an agency spokeswoman, Bob Friend of MSHA said the teams were withdrawn when they discovered that the mine's atmospheric monitoring system was still running. Due to the air quality in the mine, power to the system could have caused another explosion, according to safety experts. A borehole being drilled to check the mine's air quality was nearing the mine roof. \\"The bit and steel being used was not equipped to use water, which meant the bit was hot and could ignite an explosive mixture of methane,\\" Friend told a reporter from the West Virginia Gazette. Rescue teams returned to the mine 6:22 a.m. =Locating the trapped miners= The 13 trapped miners were about inside the mine at approximately below ground. Five four-man teams tried to make their way through the entries, which were high. By 12:40 p.m. on January 3, they had reached into the mine. It was believed that the trapped miners were somewhere between from the entrance. Two holes were drilled from the surface into areas where the miners were believed to be; microphones and video cameras lowered into them for ten-minute periods did not find any signs of life. Air quality tests performed through the first hole on the morning of January 3 indicated that carbon monoxide (CO) levels in that part of the mine were at 1,300 parts per million. Officials called this \\"very discouraging.\\" A third hole encountered groundwater and could not be drilled all the way down. However, the miners were trained to find a safe part of the mine and barricade themselves into it in the event of an explosion or collapse. Experts expected that a third hole, if successful, could expand the opening and provide a better way of rescuing the miners than proceeding into the mine. Miners are required to carry a SCSR that provides a one-hour supply of oxygen for evacuation. The first hint of the miners' status came around 5:00 p.m. on January 3 when it was reported that a body had been found. Because of the location of the body, those familiar with the miners and their jobs believed it was the fire boss, Terry Helms. Hours later, just before midnight, rumors spread quickly that 12 of the 13 miners had been found alive. Thirty minutes later, the rescue team told company officials that the original report was incorrect. In the early morning of January 4, 41 hours after the incident began, 12 of the miners were found dead. Randal L. McCloy Jr. was found alive, but in critical condition. The remaining miners were found at the working face of the second left portion of the mine, some from the mine entrance, behind a \\"rough barricade structure\\", as described by Hatfield. This is the same area where drilling had indicated high carbon monoxide levels. About three hours after the reports, company CEO Bennett Hatfield confirmed that McCloy was the sole survivor. This was the first official report from the company since the victims were found. Soon after the first reports of survivors, ambulances and the hospital emergency room were on standby. Hatfield said that carbon monoxide levels in the area where the miners were found was in the range of 300‚Äì400 ppm when the rescue team arrived. This is near the safe threshold level to support life for 15 minutes. He said that carbon monoxide poisoning was the likely cause of death. \\"Our intentions are to do the right thing and protect our people the best we can ... Federal and state mining officials will conduct a thorough investigation of the accident with full company support\\", Hatfield said. =Sole survivor's account of explosion= McCloy wrote a letter to the families of the victims, which was published in the Charleston Gazette on April 28, 2006. McCloy wrote that three weeks before the explosion, he and Junior Toler found, while drilling a bolt hole, a gas pocket, which detectors confirmed the presence of methane. \\"We immediately shut down the roof bolter, and the incident was reported up the line to our superiors. I noticed the following day that the gas leak had been plugged with glue normally used to secure the bolts.\\" He remembered that on January 2, 2006, just after exiting the mantrip, \\"the mine filled quickly with fumes and thick smoke and that breathing conditions were nearly unbearable....\\" At least four of the rescuers' emergency oxygen packs were not functioning. \\"I shared my rescuer with Jerry Groves, while Toler, Jesse Jones and Tom Anderson sought help from others. There were not enough rescuers to go around.\\" Because of the bad air, they \\"had to abandon our escape attempt and return to the coal rib, where we hung a curtain to try to protect ourselves. The curtain created an enclosed area of about 35 feet.\\" They \\"attempted to signal our location to the surface by beating on the mine bolts and plates. We found a sledgehammer, and for a long time we took turns pounding away. We had to take off the rescuers in order to hammer as hard as we could. This effort caused us to breathe much harder. We never heard a responsive blast or shot from the surface.\\" After becoming exhausted, they stopped trying to signal. \\"The air behind the curtain grew worse, so I tried to lie as low as possible and take shallow breaths... I could tell that it was gassy.\\" According to McCloy, Toler and Anderson tried to find a way out. \\"The heavy smoke and fumes caused them to quickly return. There was just so much gas.\\" At that point the miners, despite their fears, \\"began to accept our fate. Toler led us all in the Sinner's Prayer. We prayed a little longer, then someone suggested that we each write letters to our loved ones.\\" McCloy \\"became very dizzy and lightheaded. Some drifted off into what appeared to be a deep sleep, and one person sitting near me collapsed and fell off his bucket, not moving. It was clear that there was nothing I could do to help him. The last person I remember speaking to was Jackie Weaver, who reassured me that if it were our time to go, then God‚Äôs will would be fulfilled. As my trapped co-workers lost consciousness one by one, the room grew still and I continued to sit and wait, unable to do much else. I have no idea how much time went by before I also passed out from the gas and smoke, awaiting rescue.\\" On January 5, notes written by some of the deceased miners were submitted to family members. =Early response of government officials= West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin arrived at the Sago site on January 2. Congresswoman Shelley Moore Capito was also among the officials that joined the family members at the scene. The Mine Safety and Health Administration had approximately 25 people on the scene at any given time, according to the Agency's Web site. =Mine closure= On March 11, 2006, the Associated Press reported that federal inspectors had approved the Sago mine for reopening the previous day. On March 16, the Village Voice reported that the mine reopened. The paper criticized, \\"So, not knowing what caused the explosion, or whether the mine remains vulnerable to that kind of accident, the mine owners started operations again as the federal and state safety officials stood by.\\"Ridgeway, James (March 16, 2006). \\"Few Answers as Sago Mine Reopens\\". Village Voice. ICG closed the mine on March 19, 2007.\\"Sago Mine, where 12 miners died, is shut due to high costs, low coal prices\\". USA Today. March 21, 2007. Retrieved 2013-04-23. On December 12, 2008, they announced on their website they would be closing it permanently.\\"Sago Mine to close for good in ‚Äô09\\". Times West Virginia. Community Newspaper Holdings. December 13, 2008. Retrieved 2013-04-23. Investigations =West Virginia government= Governor Joe Manchin announced on January 9 that he had appointed J. Davitt McAtteer, Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health during the Clinton administration, to oversee a state probe of the disaster. The Charleston Gazette named the committee to the Sago probe as including former miner Mike Caputo, D-Marion; Eustace Frederick, D-Mercer; and Bill Hamilton, R-Upshur; and Sens. Jeff Kessler, D-Marshall; Shirley Love, D-Fayette; and Don Caruth, R-Mercer. On March 1, 2006, Governor Manchin announced the March 14, 2006, hearing had been rescheduled for May 2, delayed at the request of several family members of miners who died in the disaster. McAteer said the complex investigation warranted a careful and thorough investigation only with all the facts. McAteer later moderated a joint federal-state hearing to be held on the campus of West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon, to include a panel of MSHA, the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety & Training (WVMHST), state, labor and industry officials. Manchin said, \\"I'm confident that May's public hearings will be very useful in providing crucial information to the families of these fallen miners.\\" McAteer said MSHA and the state Office of Miners Health, Safety and Training have agreed to publish transcripts of the so far secret interviews in the federal investigation before the May 2 hearing. The commission released its preliminary report on the Sago disaster on July 19, 2006. =U.S. Department of Labor= On January 4, 2006, U.S. Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao, announced that MSHA would launch a full investigation to determine the cause, and to \\"take the necessary steps to ensure that this never happens again.\\" MSHA issued its own release, announcing an independent eight-member team that would conduct the investigation including the cause of the explosion, compliance with regulations and the handling of information on the trapped miners' condition. The team would examine the site, interview mine personnel and others with information, review records and plans, inspect any equipment involved and issue any citations for violations. The MHSA website reiterated that its team will be headed up by a senior MSHA safety professional who has not been part of the initial inspection and enforcement efforts.\\" On January 9, 2006, David G. Dye, Acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health, announced that \\"MSHA joins Governor Manchin and the State of West Virginia in announcing that we will conduct a joint investigation into the Sago Mine disaster, which will include a joint public hearing. West Virginia has its own mine safety inspection and enforcement agency, and we want to coordinate closely to ensure that our investigation is thorough and complete...Our full investigative report will also be made available to the families and the public.\\" It was announced that Richard A. Gates, MSHA district manager in Birmingham, Alabama, would head the team of technical experts. Others would be ventilation experts John Urosek and Richard Stoltz, ventilation supervisor Dennis Swentosky; electrical supervisor Robert Bates, field office supervisor Joseph O'Donnell, engineer Clete Stephan, and special investigator Gary Harris. UMWA participation On January 18, 2006, mine owner International Coal Group (ICG) issued a press release objecting to United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) participation in the investigation, accusing the union of attempting to manipulate a provision of the federal regulations, and seeking to interfere with the investigation in order to exploit the tragedy for its own purposes. In reply, UMWA International President Cecil Roberts denied ‚Äòmanipulation', saying that it was fulfilling its responsibility under the MSHA regulations. He accused the ICG of attempting to get the identities of the miners who designated the UMWA as their representative, and questioned why they needed to know that, and what they would do with that information. MSHA filed a motion in federal court to allow UMWA participation, and U.S. District Judge Robert E. Maxwell ordered ICG to allow UMW officials to enter the mine, saying \\"There's no question that the public interest is best served by a complete and thorough investigation into the occurrence of the problems at the Sago Mine....There is a strong public interest in allowing miners to play a role in this investigation, as it is their health and safety that is at issue.\\" On January 27, 2006, the ICG said it would appeal. MSHA Freedom of Information Act Disclosure Policy The Sago Mine Disaster brought public attention to criticism of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) policy first raised by Ellen Smith, editor of Mine Safety and Health News in a July 16, 2004 editorial, \\"Assault on Freedom of Information\\". She reported complaints from UMWA for over a year, from mine operators and by her paper that they could no longer get information from MSHA though the FOIA. She stated that the previous week, \\"Ed Clair, the U.S. Labor Department‚Äôs Associate Solicitor for Mine Safety and Health, disclosed that, without public comment or input, MSHA secretly changed its long-standing policy of routinely releasing inspector notes under the Freedom of Information Act.\\" The prior policy had been in effect since the Mine Act of 1977. She continued, \\"Now, the public will no longer be able to get MSHA inspector notes from a mine inspection, unless the operator or miner is willing to go through legal proceedings and the discovery process. Under this new policy, the press is certainly excluded from these notes, miners may be as well, and it certainly hampers an operator's ability to resolve many MSHA enforcement disputes without litigation.\\" On January 11, 2006, Representative Henry A. Waxman (D-CA) asked Labor Secretary Chao to reverse MSHA's 2004 decision to exclude mine safety inspectors' notes in FOIA responses, citing how the agency's secrecy policy limited disclosure about safety violations at the Sago mine for years before the recent disaster. On January 20, 2006, Education and the Workforce Committee Chairman John Boehner (R-OH), Workforce Protections Subcommittee Chairman Charlie Norwood (R-GA) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), sent a letter to Chao, also requesting a reversal. According to a news release by Boehner, on January 30, 2006, Acting Assistant Secretary David G. Dye wrote, ‚ÄúI have recently concluded that, given MSHA‚Äôs unique statutory framework, inspector notes should generally be released once a citation has been issued (or an inspection is closed without citations), rather than withholding the notes until all litigation is concluded. The policy will be effective immediately.\\" Transcripts of interviews Transcripts of 70 closed-door interviews of Sago miners, mine managers, mine rescue team members and state and federal mine safety inspectors, conducted over the period from January 17, 2006, to April 5, 2006, are available at both the Charleston Gazette and the West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training websites. As of April 28, MSHA had not posted the interviews on its site. Transcripts were made public only after The Charleston Gazette filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents and posted the documents to its website on April 16, 2006. \\"At first, state officials released a limited number of the transcripts, but then made others widely available after the Gazette obtained them and posted them on the Internet\\", reported Charleston Gazette reporter Ken Ward Jr. in his April 22, 2006, story, \\"Details of ICG's inquiry into Sago disaster sought.\\" During his interview with government investigators on March 23, 2006, ICG Vice President Sam Kitts repeatedly refused to discuss the company's investigation. His Lexington, Kentucky attorney, Maraco M. Rajkovich, who also represented several other ICG employees during the interviews, said ICG had not authorized Kitts to answer questions about the investigation. Rajkovich said he did not know who was authorized to answer such questions. MSHA publishes details of public hearing In an April 13, 2006, Federal Register notice, MSHA said state and federal officials would question witnesses at the Sago public hearing. A representative of the Sago victims‚Äô families will be able to submit questions for witnesses.\\"Sago Mine Explosion, Buckhannon,WV; Public Hearing; Correction\\" (PDF, 173KB). Federal Register / Vol. 71, No. 73 / Monday, April 17, 2006 / Notices. U.S. Department of Labor, Mine Safety and Health Administration. GPO.gov; accessed May 27, 2016. ICG refuses to release records In that same April 22, 2006, Charleston Gazette story, \\"Details of ICG's inquiry into Sago disaster sought,\\" staff writer Ken Ward Jr., reported that investigators from MSHA and the West Virginia Office of Miners Health, Safety and Training were negotiating with International Coal Group (ICG) to release company‚Äôs internal investigation, as well as testimony, for a Manchin administration public hearing on the Sago disaster scheduled to start May 2, 2006, at West Virginia Wesleyan College in Buckhannon. \\"We certainly want to see what they have,\\" said Bob Friend, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health. Office of the Solicitor, Division of Mine Safety and Health Attorneys James Crawford, Tim Williams and Bob Wilson will assist in the investigation according to MSHA's January 4, 2006, release available on the website. =U.S. Senate=  First investigation  On January 9, 2006, on his congressional website, the Senate Appropriations Committee: Labor, Heath Human Services and Education Subcommittee's ranking Democrat, West Virginia Senator Robert Byrd, announced a January 19, 2006, hearing, crediting Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), and Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, for their help in its scheduling. \\"The families of the Sago miners deserve to know what happened in that mine,‚Äù Byrd said. ‚ÄúJust as importantly, miners and their families across this country want to know that steps are being taken to prevent others from ever experiencing such pain.\\" He added, \\"The investigation at the Upshur County mine will tell us what caused that deadly explosion. But one conclusion is already evident: it‚Äôs time for the decisions affecting America‚Äôs miners to be made with their best interests at heart. That should be the legacy of the Sago miners: :In Congress, there are tough questions to be asked of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Is enforcement of coal mining regulations tough enough? Are the regulations on the books today current enough to handle the challenges posed by 21st century coal mining? Are mine hazards being minimized? These and other issues demand scrutiny, and the miners‚Äô families deserve the answers. On January 13, on its website, the committee issued a notice of the subcommittee meeting. Federal witnesses would be Acting Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health David Dye, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Mine Safety and Health Bob Friend, Coal Mine Safety and Health Administrator Ray McKinney and Mine Safety and Health Associate Solicitor, Edward Claire. Industry witnesses will be International Coal Group (ICG) President and CEO Ben Hatfield, West Virginia Coal Association Senior Vice President Chris Hamilton and National Mining Association Vice President for Safety and Health Bruce Watzman. West Virginia witness will be investigation leader Davitt McAteer. Labor witness will be UMWA International President Cecil Roberts. On January 18, 2006, on its website, the committee rescheduled the hearing for January 23, 2006. The witness list remained the same. The Republican members of the subcommittee were Arlen Specter (Chairman) (PA), Thad Cochran (MS), Judd Gregg (NH), Larry Craig (ID), Kay Bailey Hutchison (TX), Ted Stevens (AK), Mike DeWine (OH) and Richard Shelby (AL). The Democratic members were Tom Harkin (Ranking Member) (IA), Daniel Inouye (HI), Harry Reid (NV), Senator Herb Kohl (WI), Patty Murray (WA), Mary Landrieu (LA), Richard Durbin (IL). The written versions of testimony from the hearings were posted on the Appropriations Committee website. * Ben Hatfield of ICG * Bruce Watzman of the National Mining Association * Cecil Roberts of the UMWA * Chris Hamilton of the West Virginia Coal Association * David Dye of MSHA * Davitt McAteer of the West Virginia's Governor's investigation Second investigation In a January 10, 2006, letter found on his website, Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) wrote Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) Committee chairman Mike Enzi (R-WY) and ranking Democrat, Edward M. Kennedy (MA). Also signing the letter were coal state senators Robert Byrd (D-WV), Rick Santorum (R-PA), Paul Sarbanes (D-MD), Richard Durbin (D-IL), Richard Shelby (R-AL), Evan Bayh (D-IN), Barack Obama (D-IL), Jim Bunning (R-KY), Ken Salazar (D-CO), Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and Richard Lugar (R-IN). In a press release about the letter, Rockefeller stated, \\"We need to know why the administration thinks that it can carry out a policy where it is committing fewer and fewer resources to meet an industry that has more and more needs.\\" \\"We need congressional hearings not only so that we can determine what happened at Sago, but, more broadly, about the state of mine safety across West Virginia and across the country.\\" Enzi held a confirmation hearing January 31, 2006, for Bush's nominee to head MSHA, Richard Stickler. He announced he had written a January 5, 2006, letter to Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao requesting ‚Äúregular and comprehensive briefings on the progress and preliminary findings‚Äù of the MSHA investigation. and enforcement efforts at the Sago mine. Enzi held an oversight hearing March 2, 2006, into safety procedures and enforcement measures related to the disaster. (Links to testimony transcripts in PDF format.) =U.S. House of Representatives= On January 4, 2006, Representatives George Miller (D-CA) and Major Owens (D-NY) wrote a letter posted on Miller's website to House Education and Workforce Committee: Workforce Protections Subcommittee Chairman John Boehner (R-OH) asking for a hearing, saying Congress had abdicated its oversight responsibilities on worker safety issues, while the Bush administration filled worker safety agencies with industry insiders. On January 5, 2006, Representative Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) wrote Chairman Boehner requesting him to schedule a hearing at the earliest possible date and posted the letter on her congressional website. The chairman, along with subcommittee member Charlie Norwood (R-GA), issued a statement posted on the committee's website, \\"We expect MSHA to produce a thorough account of the events that occurred before, during, and after this tragedy, and the Committee will closely monitor this investigation to ensure its timely completion. Following a full accounting of the facts, the Committee will examine the results of the investigation and determine what appropriate steps may be necessary to ensure a similar tragedy never happens again.\\" Findings to date on possible causes =Lightning strike and seismic activity= Weatherbug, a Germantown, Maryland-headquartered weather tracking system reported on January 6, 2006, that, ‚Äúthe evidence suggests that the lightning strike could have caused the explosion due to the correlation between the timing and location of the lightning strike and seismic activity.‚Äù The company's equipment detected 100 lightning strikes in the region within 40 minutes of the explosion. A single, powerful lightning strike registered at or near the mouth of the Sago mine at 6:26:36 a.m. This strike carried a particularly high positive current of . (A typical strike is and relatively rare positive strikes tend to be especially destructive.) Dr. Martin Chapman, PhD, a Virginia Tech research assistant professor, found that two independent sensors recorded a minor seismic event, possibly from the explosion, 2 seconds later at 6:26:38 a.m. =Use of foam rather than concrete seals= In his January 13, 2006, story in the Charleston Gazette, \\"Sago blast area was recently sealed\\" Ken Ward Jr., reported that state officials approved the use of ‚ÄúOmega blocks,‚Äù a dense foam product, to seal the mine, rather than the required concrete blocks. Deputy director of the West Virginia Office of Miners‚Äô Health, Safety and Training told the state board of that group that, \\"the seals, made with foam, could withhold pressures of five pounds per square inch.\\" U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration rules seals to be built using \\"solid concrete blocks\\" or alternate materials that will withstand 20 pounds per square inch of pressure. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in its report, \\"Protecting Coal Miners from Gob Explosions through Explosion-Resistant Mine Ventilation Seals (1993‚Äì2005)\\" reported that \\"without reliable seal designs, miners' lives could be in jeopardy from the consequences of an underground explosion.\\" NIOSH also noted that in an explosion caused by lightning in a sealed area of the Gary 50 Mine, thick pumped cement seals tested by NIOSH and approved by MSHA, \\"effectively contained the explosion, thereby sparing the miners working nearby.\\" =Proximity with active gas and oil wells= In the January 13, 2006,Charleston Gazette story \\"Gas wells near mine\\", staff writers Paul J. Nyden and Ken Ward Jr. report that according to just released state mine permit records, at least four natural gas wells were in close proximity to the mine. One appeared to be adjacent to the sealed area where the explosion is believed to have occurred. =Sparks from restarting machinery after holiday= On January 3, 2006, Jeselyn King and Betheny Holstein, writing for the Wheeling Intelligencer had written a story \\"Explosion's Cause Remains Unknown\\". Former MSHA official Davitt McAteer said restarting operations after a holiday weekend may have caused sparks to ignite an excess buildup of methane gas and coal dust in the mine. Media coverage News of the Sago mine explosion first broke widely to television viewers on the cable news channel CNN. At approximately 11:41 a.m. on January 2, during CNN Live Today, anchor Daryn Kagan, announced, \\"This just in, news out of West Virginia, an underground explosion at a coal mine there.\\" Hundreds of media, reporters, camera crews, satellite trucks and photographers descended on the small community, taking over yards and setting up camp outside the Sago Baptist Church and at the mine's coal processing plant. Officials had turned a small second-story room there into a makeshift briefing room for the media. CNN with Anderson Cooper, Fox News with Geraldo Rivera and MSNBC with Rita Cosby all broadcast live from Sago throughout the night of January 3 and early morning of January 4 as the story continually changed. Shortly before rumors started spreading that the miners were found alive Tuesday night (and then reversed Wednesday morning), a reporter there posted a description of the scene on his blog, My West Virginia (now defunct) :Sago Road, where the mine is, follows the Buckhannon River and a set of railroad tracks. When you arrive just outside the Sago Baptist church, where relatives and friends of the miners have gathered, you see cars. Everywhere, lining the roads, in people's yards, there are cars as far as you can see. Then, you see satellite trucks and TV crews and reporters and photographers. They're also everywhere and you can tell our presence, just under 24 hours at the time, is taking a toll on the small town and the little area we've taken over. =Miscommunication and wrong reports= About 11:50 p.m. on January 3, news services including the Associated Press and Reuters reported that 12 of the 13 miners had survived, attributing the reports of survivors to the family members. CNN.com and other websites sported headlines including \\"We Got 12 Alive!\\" as well as \\"Believe in Miracles: 12 Miners Found Alive.\\"\\"12 Miners Found Alive 41 Hours After Explosion\\". New York Times. January 4, 2006. Governor Manchin, who was in the church with the families when the first incorrect reports began to come in, was soon seen outside the church celebrating \\"a miracle\\". The governor later said that his staff never confirmed that there were survivors, but was euphoric along with the families at what seemed to be remarkable news. Congresswoman Capito appeared on CNN about 1:00 a.m. and said 12 miners had been brought out alive. At about 2:45 a.m., Lynette Roby, a resident of Sago, and her two young children told CNN correspondent Anderson Cooper that Hatfield had just told family members in the church that a miscommunication had taken place and only one of the 13 miners had been found alive. The family members reportedly began to shout and call mine officials \\"liars\\" and at least one person in the church had \\"lunged\\" at mine officials. Weeks later, CNN's Randi Kaye told an audience at West Virginia University that she had been listening to Cooper's interview from outside the Sago Baptist Church. > \\"I heard this unfolding on our air and I must have said something out loud > because there was a print photographer standing beside me and he said, 'Did > you just say what I think you said?' and I said, 'I think there's only one > alive,'\\" the CNHI News Service quoted Kaye as saying. \\"Then one of our > producers was screaming in my ear, 'Get confirmation. Get confirmation'\\", > Kaye said. Bennett Hatfield confirmed the miscommunication at a press conference shortly thereafter. Initial information indicated that the miscommunication occurred between the rescue team in the mine and the command center at the surface. According to Hatfield, several personnel at the center were able to simultaneously hear the communications directly from the rescue team. Because of the state regulatory officials on site, both company and state officials, including representatives from the governor's office, were present at the command center. Hatfield estimated that 15‚Äì20 minutes elapsed before they learned that there was in fact a miscommunication. \\"Bad information\\" The CEO said he did not know how the reports of 12 survivors spread, and noted that ICG never officially made that statement, calling it \\"bad information\\" that \\"spread like wildfire.\\" He said that the information could have been spread through \\"stray cell phone communication.\\" \\"I have no idea who made that announcement,\\" he said, \\"but it was not an announcement that International Coal Group had authorized.\\" Asked by reporters why the company allowed rumors to circulate for several hours, Hatfield said officials had been trying to clarify and verify information before putting family members on an even worse emotional roller coaster. However, Fox correspondent Bill Hemmer said he was \\"ashamed\\" of how the media repeatedly reported the existence of survivors even as reporters and producers themselves were growing to understand that, in his words, \\"something didn't add up.\\" Hemmer noted that the coal company, which had been quite punctual in its dealings with the media throughout the rescue attempt, had not given any information to corroborate the allegations that 12 miners had been rescued, and that the always-available Manchin was nowhere to be found, yet the cable news channels continued to report the story anyway until doctors in a hospital many miles away stated that they had had no contact with emergency service personnel about any of the miners except for McCloy. Speaking on MSNBC's Imus in the Morning program, Lisa Daniels speculated that erroneous reports about survivors on local radio stations were heard by mine officials, causing them to question the accuracy of their own information stating that 12 of the 13 were dead, which in turn delayed an official announcement. 12 died and one survived. Wrong headlines Many Wednesday morning newspapers in the United States erroneously reported on their front pages that 12 miners were found alive. USA Today ran a headline in their East Coast edition that read \\"Alive! Miners beat odds\\". The printed New York Times attributed its information to the family members, but the Times's website initially displayed a headline that expressed the live rescue as fact. Others, such as the Washington Post, were unclear in their attributions. In a published report on the website of the newspaper trade journal Editor & Publisher, the editor of The Inter-Mountain, a local afternoon daily based in Elkins, West Virginia, blamed the national media's inaccurate reporting on a lack of knowledge of local culture. \\"We get a lot of people here who sometimes believe they have an inside story because they hear it on a police scanner or listen to a conversation,\\" Linda Skidmore said. \\"We know to be cautious of those situations.\\" =Media criticism of MSHA= Critics suggested that the severity of the accident's aftermath was related in part to inadequate safety standards endorsed by the MSHA under David Lauriski, a mining industry executive appointed to head the agency by George W. Bush. On January 6, 2006, Scott Lilly, a columnist for the Center for American Progress wrote about Lauriski in his article, \\"MSHA and the Sago Mine Disaster: How Many Brownies are there in this Administration?\\" An August 9, 2004, story in the New York Times by Christopher Drew and Richard A. Oppel, Jr., \\"Friends in the White House Come to Coal's Aid\\", had summed up Lauriski's record.Friends in the White House Come to Coal's Aid. New York Times. August 9, 2004 Other problems cited included the rejection of a proposed clarification of an existing standard, \\"Escapeways and Refuges,\\" by Lauriski's administration, which requires that a mine \\"shall have two or more separate, properly maintained escapeways to the surface....\\" A January 5 editorial in The New York Times explicitly linked the safety conditions at the mine to the effects of \\"an industry with pervasive political clout and patronage inroads in government regulatory agencies.\\" It noted that \\"political figures from both parties have long defended and profited from ties to the coal industry,\\" and asserted that \\"the Bush administration's cramming of important posts in the Department of the Interior with biased operatives\\" created doubts about mine safety, singling out J. Steven Griles, a former mining lobbyist and onetime deputy secretary of the Interior who, The Times alleged \\"devoted four years to rolling back mine regulations.\\" Federal responsibility for enforcing the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, which governs the activities of the MSHA, was transferred from the Department of the Interior to the Department of Labor in 1978. A second editorial in the Times, on January 6 discussed budget cuts to the MSHA and \\"the Bush administration's ... [appointment] of a raft of political appointees directly from energy corporations to critical regulatory posts\\" in the context of the disaster, suggesting that the Sago 12 \\"might have survived if government had lived up to its responsibilities.\\" Other commentators, including Scott Shields, a blogger for MyDD,MyDD:: How Bush Failed the Sago 13 , mydd.com; January 3, 2006; accessed August 26, 2016. Kevin Drum, a blogger for The Washington Monthly, and Andrew Sullivan also linked the presence of Republican-appointed coal mining executives in the MSHA to the tragedy. Jack Spadaro, a former director of the National Mine Health and Safety Academy who was fired after participating as a whistleblower in a prior case involving the MSHA, made similar statements, referring to the current Bush administration's \\"reluctance to take the strong enforcement action that's sometimes necessary\\" in an appearance on the show Hannity & Colmes. Spadaro was criticized as \\"extreme left-wing\\" for his statements by host Sean Hannity. The MSHA, on a \\"Questions and Answers\\" page regarding the incident, has strongly disputed many of these criticisms. In particular, the administration noted that the Sago mine was not an \\"accident waiting to happen\\" as the MSHA had never cited the mine for violations that would lead to \\"immediate risk of injury.\\" It noted also that it had exercised its right to shut down various parts of the mine, eighteen times in 2005, until safety problems were corrected. Most relevant to the criticisms discussed in this section, the MSHA explicitly disputed the suggestion that \\"MSHA has grown 'too soft' on mine operators and has not been aggressive enough in enforcing the Mine Act.\\" It noted that between 2000 and 2005, the number of citations it had issued had increased by 4%, and the number of coal-mine specific citations had increased by 18%. Dennis O'Dell, of the United Mine Workers of America union, disputed this response, suggesting that the fines MSHA handed to companies for these violations were too small to force action. A Knight Ridder \\"investigative report\\", published on January 7 and containing reference to the official MSHA response, concluded that \\"Since the Bush administration took office in 2001, it has been more lenient toward mining companies facing serious safety violations, issuing fewer and smaller major fines and collecting less than half of the money that violators owed.\\" =Evaluation of media coverage= West Virginia University On February 13, 2006, The West Virginia University Perley Isaac Reed School of Journalism convened a panel of six journalists for a forum titled ‚ÄúSearching for a Miracle: Media Coverage of the Sago Mine Disaster.‚Äù According to the School's website, the forum covered the \\"challenges faced by journalists covering the story, the lessons they learned and the role that 24-hour news coverage may have played in one of the biggest media faux pas of the century.\\" Moderator Kelly McBride, Ethics Group Leader for Florida's Poynter Institute was quoted by the Charleston Gazette's February 14, 2006, story, \\"Forum at WVU examines media coverage of Sago Mine disaster\\" by Ry Rivard, as saying, \\"There were real people involved in this story. Real people who didn‚Äôt deserve to become the epicenter of a news event....Journalism is supposed to be a service to communities.\\" Mark Memmott, a media issues reporter for USA Today said, \\"Out there in the real world the story is that mines aren‚Äôt safe, and why did it take so long for rescuers to get there.... Just because we did this panel doesn‚Äôt mean we think the media blowing it is the big story.\\" According to Memmott, the New York Times, without directly quoting Joe Thornton, West Virginia's deputy secretary for the Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety said Thornton had confirmed \\"rescued miners were being examined at the mine shortly before midnight and would soon be taken to nearby hospitals. Mr. Thornton said he did not know details of their medical condition.\\" C-SPAN's American Perspectives: Katrina Recovery & W.V. Mining Disaster aired the forum on February 18, 2006, and has a video of the forum available online as clip 24738. (includes video link.) West Virginia legislation: SB 247 After the Sago Mine disaster, the state legislature passed Gov. Joe Manchin's SB247 on the January 23, 2006, the same day it was submitted. The bill created a new mine emergency-response system and required coal companies to provide miners with additional emergency air supplies, communications equipment and tracking devices. The governor signed the bill into law on January 27, 2006. Provisions of the law and its history of passage are available on the state legislature's website. =Emergency rules= In a story in the Charleston Gazette on February 3, 2006, \\"Manchin mine rules contain no deadlines\\", staff writer Ken Ward Jr. reported on emergency rules filed February 1, 2006, with WV Secretary of State Betty Ireland to implement the law. The Manchin administration could have put the requirements into effect as soon as Ireland approved them, or in 42 days if she took no action. The Governor must have submitted the rules for a public comment period and revised them accordingly. The emergency rules could have remained in effect for 15 months. Final rules required legislative approval, which was likely to take place in the 2007 session. Federal legislation =S.2231= On February 1, 2006, Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) introduced a bill to direct the Secretary of Labor to prescribe additional coal mine safety standards and require additional penalties for habitual violators. The bills was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. Initial cosponsors were Democrats Richard Durbin (IL), Tom Harkin (IA), Ted Kennedy (MA), Barack Obama (IL) and Jay Rockefeller (WV). The status of the bill can be tracked on Congress.gov, the Library of Congress's legislative information system.Congress.gov (Library of Congress). (S.2231 - Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 2006). Senator Byrd outlined some of the provisions of the bill on his Senate website. Statements made by Senators Byrd, Rockefeller, Reid and Kennedy regarding the introduction of this bill were published in the 2006 Congressional Record, pages S447 to S452. * The bill would mandate equipment to communicate with miners, locate miners, and provide sufficient caches of air. * Rescue teams must be staffed and on site. * Operators must notify the MSHA immediately when there is an accident. Any coal operator who fails to do so will be subject to a $100,000 fine, and/or 12 to 15 years imprisonment * The bill would mandate a rapid notification and response system. * The bill would create a new mandatory minimum penalty of $10,000 for coal operators that show ‚Äúnegligence or reckless disregard‚Äù for the safety standards of the Mine Act. * The bill would nullify an MSHA rule issued in 2004 that authorizes the use of belt entries for ventilation, which may have caused fire in another accident at Alma. * The bill would create a science and technology transfer office in MSHA to pull research and development ideas from other federal agencies for use in the mines. * The bill would create an ombudsman in the Labor Department‚Äôs Inspector General office for miners to report safety violations. Office of Miners Health, Safety and Training (MHST) In the first set of rules, the state Office of MHST will require caches of air supplies to give each miner at least 16 additional devices. Mines with coal seams taller than four feet (1.2 m) must have caches every in each working section. In smaller mines, there must be caches every . Operators must submit plans for cache locations within 30 days for review and suggestions for change; however there is no deadline for equipping the mines with the caches. Coal operators have no deadline to provide miners with improved rescue gear. It also sets no deadline for new communications equipment or tracking devices. On February 2, 2003, MHST director Conaway said as soon as the equipment becomes available, \\"we‚Äôre expecting them to be in the mines....An operator is going to have to show us that they have it or that it‚Äôs on order....If they can‚Äôt get them, they are going to have to show us that they have ordered them and that they are trying to get them.‚Äù According to Ward, Chris Hamilton, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said ‚ÄúI know there are several months of backlog right now...There is still some concern on the reliability of the wireless communications and tracking system....A lot of that is still in the prototype stage and not commercially available.‚Äù This last statement contradicts the finding of a 2003 MSHA report, which called the systems ‚Äúgenerally effective‚Äù and said the agency ‚Äúencourages‚Äù their use. Mine and Industrial Accident Rapid Response System The West Virginia Division of Homeland Security proposes a rule that requests filed under the state Freedom of Information Act ‚Äúshall be held in abeyance until appropriate notification of next of kin of any deceased or victims that are grievously injured.‚Äù The next of kin will have to give consent for the release of information. Any requests for information about mine accidents reported to the new response system must include the ‚Äúexact dates and times‚Äù of accidents and ‚Äúthe intended use of any information provided.‚Äù Jimmy Gianato, the state‚Äôs homeland security director, said the language might need to be revised if questions are raised about properly responding to FOIA requests. =H.R. 4695= On February 1, 2006, Representative Nick J. Rahall (D-WV) filed companion legislation in the House of Representatives, where it was referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. Cosponsors were Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Alan B. Mollohan (D-WV). Current status is found by searching on the bill number on Thomas, the Library of Congress's legislative information system. The Congressional Record for Rahall's comments is found on page H127. His extended comments are found on pages E 46 and 47. Rule changes for the Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 =Emergency temporary rules for mine operators= On March 9, 2006, David G. Dye, acting assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health, announced that MSHA was invoking a power that had only been invoked twice since its formation in 1978. ‚ÄúThis...will require the use of proven technologies and techniques to help miners evacuate quickly and safely after a mine accident....We are using the emergency temporary standard to get help into the field as fast as possible.‚Äù The proposed rules were published in the Federal Register. *Self-Contained Self Rescue Devices (SCSRs): Provide additional SCSRs for each miner underground in a storage area to be readily accessible in an emergency. *Lifelines Install lifelines in all primary and alternate escape routes to help guide miners when visibility is poor. *Miner training Quarterly emergency evacuation drills on transferring from one SCSR to another. *Accident Notification Informing MSHA of an accident within 15 minutes =Omega Block moratorium= After a second mine accident, which resulted in five deaths in which the foam blocks did not withstand an explosion at the Kentucky Darby, LLC Mine No. 1 in Harlan, Kentucky, David Dye, Acting MSHA director, announced a moratorium on the use of the blocks and a requirement to test for methane build up behind the seals. Writing about the announcement in his May 23, 2006, article, \\"Mine sealer banned,\\" Brian Bowling of the Pittsburgh Tribune Review noted that \\"Officials at International Coal Group, which owns the Sago Mine, contend the agency's 20-pounds-per-square- inch standard is inadequate. The Ashland, Kentucky, company hired a structural engineer, who determined explosive forces in the West Virginia mine reached as high as 60 to 90 psi.\\" This assertion was made by the company in its March 14, 2006, news release announcing the reopening of the mine and the findings of its initial study of reasons for the accident. In popular culture The band Trailer Choir's song \\"What Would You Say\\" is a song about the Sago Mine Disaster. The following words appear in the song: \\"13 men felt trapped in a mine in West Virginia,/only one made it out alive/but their love lives on in the words/I can not wait to see you on the other side.\\" The song \\"Sago Mine\\" by Pete and Maura Kennedy appears on The Kennedys (band) album \\"Better Dreams\\". They write in the liner notes: \\"We were in West Virginia while this was happening, and the manipulation of the hopes of the townspeople gave an extra overlay of tragedy to the event.\\" See also * Aracoma Alma Mine accident (January 19, 2006) * Mining accident * Quecreek Mine rescue (July 2002) References Sources * ABC News; January 3, 2006, Rescuers Break Ground in Miner Mission. * Associated Press; January 5, 2006, The Victims.

Though not a true gazelle, it is similarly marked, with long legs and neck. It is often confused with the gerenuk due to their striking resemblance. The typical head-and-body length is about . They stand up to about . Male dibatag weigh between , whereas females range from . The length of the curved horns, present only on males, is typically between . The upper parts are gray to fawn, while the dorsal and lateral areas are cinnamon to rufous (reddish brown). The underparts, rump and the insides of the legs are all white. While markings are visible on the face, there are none on the flanks or the buttocks. Dibatag are alert and secretive, and their brown coat provides an excellent camouflage, making the dibatag one of the antelopes most difficult to hunt. They are diurnal animals, and navigate in very small herds. Both sexes attain sexual maturity at 12 to 18 months. The species is polygynous. After a gestational period of six to seven months, a single offspring is born. Parturition usually occurs from September to November. The lifespan typically averages 10 to 12 years. Dibatag may maintain temporary territories demarcated by preorbital gland secretions, urine or feces. Primarily browsers, the dibatag feed on foliage and young shoots and shrubs. Dibatag are well adapted to semi-arid habitats, with the capability of surviving on very little or no water. Several factors including human settlement, habitat degradation, large numbers of livestock, political unrest and armed conflicts in the areas covering its range and lack of conservation measures for two to three decades in the late 20th century have now reduced the population to only a few thousand. Significant populations still occur in southern Ogaden (Ethiopia). The dibatag is listed by the IUCN as \\"Vulnerable\\". Taxonomy and etymology The dibatag was first described in 1891 by British zoologist Oldfield Thomas, who he gave it the scientific name Ammodorcas clarkei. It is the sole member of the genus Ammodorcas, and is placed in the family Bovidae. Some authors such as Rod East of the IUCN SSC Antelope specialist group have classified it under a separate tribe Ammodorcadini. When Thomas first studied specimens from Somalia in 1891, he observed that the animal seemed to combine the horns of a reedbuck with the characteristic features of a gazelle (muzzle, facial markings, and anteorbital glands). At first, he considered it to be a reedbuck, though it appeared unnatural that a reedbuck should occur in the dry sandy plateau of Somalia. Thomas originally considered it a relative of the genus Redunca due to similarities in the morphology of horns, and placed it under the genus Cervicapra. However, after considering further specimens, he placed it under the separate genus Ammodorcas. No subspecies have been identified. The dibatag, which holds its black tail straight up when it is fleeing, gets its common name from the Somali words for 'tail' and 'erect': dabu and tag. The dibatag is also known as Clarke's gazelle, after T. W. H. Clarke, an Australian big game hunter who collected the type specimen. Description Detail of head illustrated by Joseph Smit, The dibatag is a medium-sized antelope with a slim body and long neck and legs. The typical head-and-body length is about . It stands up to about at the shoulder. The male weighs between , whereas the female ranges from . The long dark tail ends in a rounded but indistinct tassel. The tail is nearly long. The curved horns, resembling those of reedbuck, are present only on males, with the pointing tips facing forward. The length of horns is typically between , though Rowland Ward recorded a length of from Somalia. This antelope is sexually dimorphic, because females tend to be smaller than males and lack horns. Two views of a male dibatag skull The species has a small, flat, pointed, wedge-shaped head with large eyes and medium-sized ears. A similarity to the gazelles is the black, branched structure in the interior of the ears. The mouth is very small and the upper lip slightly elongated. There are strong facial markings resembling those of a gazelle. A chestnut brown streak runs from the crown up to the nostrils along the nose, flanked on both sides by parallel white stripes that circle the eyes. A white spot marks the throat. The soft and smooth coat is gray to fawn in the upper parts. The ventral side, rump and the insides of the legs are completely white, and the flanks and the buttocks are unmarked. The dibatag closely resembles the gerenuk, with which it is sympatric in eastern and central Somalia and southeastern Ethiopia. Both are brachyodonts and share several facial and cranial features, along with a two- tone coloration of the pelage and strong thick horns (only in males). However, there are also some features distinguishing it from the gerenuk, including major morphological differences in horns, horn cores, tail, postorbital area and basioccipital processes. The gerenuk has a longer, heavier neck and a shorter tail. A finer point of difference is the absence of an inward-curving lobe in the lower edge of the ear (near its tip) in the gerenuk. Ecology and behavior Dibatag are diurnal animals (they are active in the daytime). They navigate either in solitude or in very small herds, resembling the social behavior of the gerenuk. Singles and pairs are most common, though groups of up to six individuals have been reported. Generally groups of over four individuals are rarely observed. The reaction of dibatag towards gerenuk is obscure, with there being reports of their loose associations as well as avoidance of each other. These territorial animals may maintain temporary territories demarcated by preorbital gland secretions, urine or feces. They defecate at fixed points and form dung piles. Males fight one another to defend their territory. Sparring is a notable part of fighting behavior: one male pushes and shoves against the neck and horns of the opponent, trying to throw him off balance. The stance is head down with the nose tucked between the forelegs for protection. Dibatags are well adapted to semi-arid habitats, with the capability of surviving on very little or no water. They meet most water requirements only from food. Their long neck and limbs enable them to place their forelegs on branches and reach higher branches. The brown pelage helps them hide in bushes. Alert and secretive, the dibatag hides in vegetation and remains motionless while watching for possible threats. When alarmed it flees in a slow and relaxed manner with the neck upright and tail erect. The antelope may even resort to stotting (a behavior particular to the gazelles), a kind of leaping with all four limbs in the air, but this gait is most often used during play. It gallops only when in real danger. Predators include the cheetah, lion, spotted hyaena, black-backed jackal, caracal, Cape hunting dog and large eagles. Eagles usually target juveniles. =Diet= Commiphora, one of the plants preferred by the dibatag The dibatag is a typical browser, whose diet consists of foliage and young shoots and shrubs. It limits itself to a small area for foraging. Dibatag have hardly been observed drinking water in the wild. The elongated upper lip assists in the ingestion of thorny vegetation, while leaves are plucked off by the front teeth and mobile lips. They prefer Commiphora, Acacia, Boscia, Dichrostachys and Maerua species. They often gather in areas with leafy Commiphora stands due to the high water content of their leaves and shoots. In the rainy season, young soft grasses are preferred, while in the dry season they feed on fry fruits, flowers, buds, shrubs, and tall herbs. They choose a wide variety of species for browsing, hence no clear diet specialization is identified. =Reproduction= Both sexes attain sexual maturity at 12 to 18 months. The species is polygynous. Rutting appears to be related to the onset of the wet season in several parts of the range. Observations in the Naples Zoo show many similarities between the courtship behavior of the dibatag and that of the gerenuk. The male dibatag pursues the female; during the march his body is upright and the nose is held high. The male uses preorbital gland secretions to mark the female on her chest and rump. Flehmen, leg-tapping, urine testing and nosing of female genitalia are notable features of the courtship. Once in close contact with the female, he slowly raises his foreleg between her hindlegs; this is followed by copulation. After a gestational period of six to seven months, a single offspring is born. Parturition usually occurs from September to November, though births have been reported even in June and July. The infant remains in hiding for one or two weeks, with its mother close by. No further information on parental care is available. The lifespan of a dibatag averages 10 to 12 years. Habitat and distribution An 1894 map showing the historical distribution of dibatag in Somaliland Dibatag inhabit a mix of different habitat types. They may occasionally visit treelands. They are thought to be more commonly found in areas where Commiphora shrubs grow. They occur within the altitude range of . Habitat preference does not vary significantly with seasons. A study published in 1972 found a greater number of the dibatag in areas rich in red soil. The dibatag is endemic to the evergreen bushland of the Ogaden region of southeastern Ethiopia and adjoining parts in northern and central Somalia. In the past their range extended from the southern parts of northern Somalia through southeastern Ethiopia and central Somalia (between the coastline of the Indian Ocean and bounded by the Fafen River in the west and the Shebelle River in the southwest). Rock paintings of two dibatag were discovered on the west bank of the river Nile and north of the Aswan Dam in Egypt, suggesting a southward migration of the species in the Predynastic period in Egypt. Nowadays, however, the dibatag has disappeared from the majority of its historical range. From 1985 to 2006, over two decades, the overall decline has been estimated at more than 30 percent of the original population. In the northern Ogaden, the animal has become very rare owing to a high density of human settlements and large numbers of armed pastoralists and their livestock. However, in the southern Ogaden, it is still common due to greater wealth of natural flora and fewer human settlements. Threats and conservation Droughts and habitat degradation are the major threats across the range. In Somalia, conservation measures have been hindered by lack of political stability due to conflicts over two to three decades in the latter half of the 20th century. During this period its habitat was adversely affected by over-exploitation of wildlife, prevalence of weapons and deforestation. In Ethiopia hunting is the most severe threat to the dibatag; locals have claimed that dibatag meat is preferred due to its excellent taste. However its brown pelage and alertness and timidity make hunting for it in dense bushes considerably difficult compared to other antelopes. The dibatag has been identified as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). It has not been listed under the Washington Convention (CITES). There are no protected areas in its range. No population estimates or surveys could be made in the three decades from the 1960s to the 1990s due to political unrest and armed conflicts in the areas covering the range. The total surviving population is not known. In 1998, Rod East gave an estimate that the populations must be in only a few thousand given a total remaining range of and a population density of 0.1 to 0.3 per square kilometer. In 2006, the population in Ogaden was estimated at 1,500. The scenario is grim in Somalia: the dibatag have been overhunted, and their habitat faces destruction due to farming practices such as livestock grazing. They are also threatened by drought. It had nearly disappeared from most of the country by the early 1980s. Though locals claimed to have seen it in the central coastal hinterland even in the late 1980s, no clear surveys have been conducted since then to support this. Captive populations are not known.

It is named after the late film star Maria Montez, who was born in the province of Barahona. The airport is on the coast, and approach from and departure toward the east each involve altitude changes over water. The Barahona VOR/DME (Ident: BHO) and Barahona non-directional beacon (Ident: BHN) are located on the field.Barahona VORBarahona NDB It has the capacity to receive Jumbo 747, DC-10 and other wide-bodied aircraft. It has a large parking lot for more than a hundred vehicles. Until November 1998 in this one labored about 100 employees. Later, from 1999 to 2017, the number of employees is lower, this is attributed to the reduction of the operations that this terminal has at the moment.  History  Maria Montez Airport was officially inaugurated on Saturday, April 27, 1996, in a ceremony presided over by President Joaqu√≠n Balaguer. It was built at a cost of almost five hundred million pesos. In the year 2010 as consequences of the devastating earthquake that shook Haiti on January 12, about 70 members of the 61 The fifth contingency Response Wing of the United States Army was deployed in the Dominican Republic with the support of Operation Unified Response. Due to the influx of overwhelming air traffic at the Port-au-Prince International Airport, Haiti, additional locations were identified at the San Isidro Air Base and Maria Montez International Airport, as delivery staging areas for the provision of humanitarian aid. In 2011, with an investment of $30 million peso RD,the runway was restored and takeoff of that air station, which has a dimension of 3.000 meters, a platform for aircraft parking 40.000 square meters, and a taxiway of 300 meters that, where they facilitate the operations of large aircraft. In the month of July 2012, the operations of the International Company organization Terpel were initiated as an aviation fuel supplier for the airport. In 2016, Aerodom is the operator of this terminal who performs efficiently all the tasks of maintenance of this airport with around 22 employees.

The terminal has immigration services, customs, plant and animal health, drug control. Security is commissioned by the specialized Civil Aviation Security Corps (CESAC), which controls the safety of the terminal. In 2017, the biggest investment in the private sector in the area was for the hotel and real estate project Perla del Sur, in La Cienaga, which is intended to inaugurate im 2019 with a first stage of 162 has Bitaciones. Although the project contemplates 1.200 rooms that will be finished in eight years, 5 that will allow the entrance more number of tourists via this terminal, which is and will be used for this project for expansive purposes. In August 2018, The Ministry of Public Works and communications (MOPC) made an asphalt road access to the airport from the city as well as its parking aerial to improve the conditions of this air finish. These improvements are framed to make the airport's appearance and conditions better and for users who occasionally make use of that air terminal, can show the intentions that from the state are sought to put the terminal in operation Aerial. 6 Asphalt works North Park of AIMM Barahona The asphalt that carries out public works, in first phase contemplates the road that gives access and the whole area of parking, which is already in phase of completion, of Maria Montez and then, according to source to this medium, will continue with the runway of that term Air Inar, which will be conditioned and extended.

The company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry, including printers, bookbinders, booksellers, and publishers in England. The Register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work, and constituted an early form of copyright law. The Company's charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books. For the study of English literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries--for the Elizabethan era, the Jacobean era, the Caroline era, and especially for English Renaissance theatre --the Stationers' Register is a crucial and essential resource: it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else. Together with the records of the Master of the Revels (which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication), the Stationers' Register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, and all of their immediate predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.Chambers, Elizabethan Stage, Vol. 3, pp. 164-77. By paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence, a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work. One example: the Stationers' Register reveals that on 26 November 1607, the stationers John Busby and Nathaniel Butter claimed the right to print \\"A booke called Master William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear, as yt was played before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall vppon Sainct Stephens night at Christmas Last, by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the Globe on the Banksyde.\\" (They paid sixpence.)Halliday, Shakespeare Companion, pp. 265 and 474. Enforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world; books were sometimes published without registration, and other irregularities also occurred. In some cases, the companies of actors appear to have registered plays through co-operative stationers, with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interest.Much Ado About Nothing, Henry V, As You Like It, and Every Man in His Humour were registered, apparently for such a purpose (\\"to be stayed\\"), on 4 August 1600. Yet if this interpretation is correct, the strategy to forestall publication had limited success; the first two plays were published later in 1600, and the last in 1601. Only As You Like It remained out of print at the time. Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 359; Halliday, pp. 216, 326. In 1710, the Copyright Act or Statute of Anne entered into force, superseding company provisions pertaining to the Register. The company continued to offer some form of registration of works until February 2000. References Sources * Arber, Edward, ed.

Developed from the Saro P.531, it served as a land-based general purpose military helicopter, sharing a common ancestor and numerous components with the naval-orientated Westland Wasp helicopter. The type's primary operator was the Army Air Corps of the British Army, which operated it in several conflict zones including Northern Ireland and the Falklands War. Development Both the Scout and the Wasp were developed from the Saunders- Roe P.531, itself a development of the Saunders-Roe Skeeter. With the acquisition of Saunders Roe, Westland took over the P.531 project, which became the prototype for the Scout (originally called Sprite) and the Wasp. The initial UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) development contract was for a five to six seat general purpose helicopter. The first version that met both RN and Army requirement, the P.531-2, flew on 9 August 1959 with a Bristol Siddeley Nimbus engine. A de Havilland Gnome engine-equipped version was also trialled, starting 3 May 1960. The production Scout AH.1 used a Rolls-Royce Nimbus engine (RR having acquired Bristol Siddeley by then). The engine was rated at , but the torque was limited to . Extensive theoretical design and practical testing was carried out to provide an undercarriage that was tolerant to ground resonance. The first Army Scout AH Mk 1 flew on 4 August 1960, a powered-controls version followed in March 1961 and deliveries started in early 1963. Following trials ranging from Canada to Nairobi, the airframe was released for operations between ‚àí26C and ISA+30C. Design Behind the two front seats was a three-seat bench, although this could be replaced with a four-seat bench when fitted with modified rear doors. It was used for general light work, including observation, liaison, training and search & rescue. When fitted as a light attack helicopter, it carried either two, skid-mounted, forward-firing machine gun (L8A1 General Purpose Machine Gun) packs or a single pintle-mounted machine gun in the rear cabin. The pintle mount was available in both port and starboard mountings. The gun-packs, which were both aimed at a pre-set convergence angle, carried 200 rounds of ammunition and were mounted on a tubular spar that was fixed between the front and rear undercarriage legs. In the anti-tank role, it could carry four guided missiles (the Nord SS.11). The sighting unit was the AF.120, the result of a joint venture between Avimo and Ferranti, had x2.5 and x10 magnification. The APX Bezu sight unit was also evaluated but rejected, although it was adopted for use on the Westland Wasp. SS.11 equipped Scout of 3 CBAS in 1978 Additional testing and trials were carried out with the Swingfire anti-tank guided missile. Initial firings were carried out in early 1972, to test the \\"Hawkswing\\" system for the Westland Lynx, the associated AF.530 gyro- stabilized sight was subsequently trialled in 1974. The Hawkswing system was cancelled in 1975 due to its manual command to line of sight (MCLOS) compared to the semi-automatic (SACLOS) system used by the MILAN missile. In the casualty evacuation role (CASEVAC), the Scout could carry two stretchers internally or two on externally mounted pods, the co-pilot's seat could also be reversed to allow an attendant to face the casualties. Although the general design of the aircraft was robust, with an airframe fatigue life of 7,200 hours, the cockpit ergonomics were less than perfect. An example of this was the cabin heater switch being mounted next to the fuel cock; this led to the loss of at least four aircraft when the pilot inadvertently closed the fuel cock instead of switching off the cabin heater, causing the engine to shut down. The autorotational qualities of the Scout have also been described by some pilots as 'startling'. In service trials and testing were carried out by the AAC's Development Wing at Middle Wallop, Hampshire. A wide variety of weapons and equipment were evaluated, although many were never adopted. Amongst these were the 7.62mm General Electric Minigun and the two-inch rocket pod. The rocket pods were mounted either side of the central fuselage section on the multi-spar weapon booms and both smooth tube and fin-stabilised rockets were tested, although the accuracy was described as \\"indifferent\\". Studies were also carried out for a pintle-mounted M2 Browning machine gun in place of the standard 7.62 GPMG, and the French AME.621 20mm cannon. Another was the installation of a Bendix R.100 lightweight weather and ground-mapping radar, which had a range of eight and 40 miles. This was mounted behind the fibreglass nose access panel along with a small viewing screen in the cockpit. The radar antenna was moved further forward later in the development to improve downward scanning. During the development of the WG.13 Westland Lynx, two Scouts were used as testbeds and fitted with full-scale, composite construction semi-rigid Lynx main rotor heads as the Scout had the nearest size rotor. The first test flight was achieved 31 August 1970. The first prototype MBB BO 105 tested the airframe with Scout main rotor head and blades but it was destroyed due to ground resonance during its initial trials. About 150 Scouts were built through 1968, primarily at the Fairey Aviation Division factory at Hayes. Scout AH.1 at Farnborough 1962 Operational history The Scout formed the backbone of the Army Air Corps throughout the 1960s and well into the 1970s; the first Scout flew on 29 August 1960 and an initial order for 66 aircraft followed a month after its first flight. Engine problems delayed the introduction of the Scout until 1963, and as an interim measure the Army Air Corps received a small number of Alouette II helicopters. Although the aircraft's entry into service was delayed, the Scout still had a number of teething troubles when it was introduced. One of the earliest losses was XR596, which crashed into the jungle near Kluang airfield in southern Malaya on 16 July 1964, following a fuel pump failure. The two crew died in the incident. Engine failures were responsible for the loss of at least 11 military and civilian registered aircraft. The engine life of the Nimbus during the early part of its service was notoriously low, with four to six flying hours being the norm. A competition was allegedly held, with a prize to the first unit that could achieve an engine life of 25 flying hours. Operational experience and development work steadily improved the reliability of the Nimbus and by 1964 engine life had improved to two or three engine changes per 1,000 flying hours. The Scout AH Mk 1 was operated by the Army Air Corps on general light work, including observation and liaison. Like the Wasp, the Scout could be fitted out with different role equipment including flotation gear and a Lucas air-driven hoist which had a lift capacity of . In the light attack role, it was capable of carrying one pintle machine gun in the rear cabin (it is possible to carry two pintle-mounted GPMGs in the cabin, although this would, unsurprisingly, be somewhat cramped) or two forward- firing 7.62mm L7 General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs) fixed to the undercarriage skid. These GPMG combinations were sometimes used in unison to great effect. The forward firing GPMGs were electrically operated, being fired by the pilot and aimed using a rudimentary system of drawing a small cross on the windscreen with a chinagraph pencil. In sandy conditions, these weapons could jam, which necessitated one of the free crew leaning out of the cockpit door and 'booting' the offending weapon in the hope of clearing it. This procedure was not strictly in accordance with the flight reference cards. The L7A1 pintle-mounted weapon was operated by a door gunner. 8 Flight Scout AH.1 at Habilayn, Radfan 1967 In the anti-tank role, four SS.11 ATGWs were carried; these could be carried in conjunction with the pintle-mounted GPMG. During the Falklands campaign, the SS.11 achieved some success, being used to attack Argentine positions on 14 June 1982. For night time reconnaissance, the Scout could carry four parachute flares mounted on special carriers. In addition, two smaller parachute flares could be carried to allow emergency landings at night. These were fitted on the starboard rear fuselage on a special attachment point. About 150 Scout helicopters were acquired for the Army Air Corps, which operated them until 1994. The way British military aviation has been established has meant that the Royal Marines have never actually \\"owned\\" their own aircraft. The larger Westland Whirlwind, Westland Wessex and Westland Sea Kings have been Fleet Air Arm helicopters and, like today's Lynx AH Mk 7, the Scout AH Mk 1s operated by 3 Commando Brigade Air Squadron (3 CBAS) were British Army helicopters on loan. 3 CBAS flew the Scout from 1971 through to 1982, when it was replaced by the Westland Lynx, and the squadron was eventually renumbered as 847 Naval Air Squadron.847 NAS Affiliations The Scout saw operational service in Borneo during the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation, the Aden Emergency, Oman, Rhodesia, Northern Ireland and then in the South Atlantic. The Territorial Army (AAC) formed 666 Squadron with a number of Scouts in the late 1980s. =Borneo= Mystery still surrounds a Scout that went missing 20 September 1965.Geldard, Geoffrey 1965: XR599 ‚Äì Was missing helicopter hijacked? XR599 set off for a night flight from Lundu to Kuching, the mission being to transport a local communist suspect to the Sarawak capital for interrogation. At 23:00 hrs, the aircraft was posted as missing and a search and rescue mission was mounted. Although the aircraft and the remains of the pilot, the escort rifleman and the suspect were never found, a fisherman later dredged up small parts of the aircraft wreckage. On 23 September, the Singapore newspaper The Straits Times, printed a story speculating that the Scout had been hijacked by the prisoner who had somehow managed to capture his escort's weapon and then ordered the pilot to either fly out to sea or over the jungle towards the Indonesian border until they ran out of fuel. Tragedy struck a second time on 25 September when an RAF Westland Whirlwind HAR.10 of 225 Sqn, searching over jungle for XR599, crashed killing the five crew.Geldard, Geoffrey 1965: 5 Die in Copter Crash in Sarawak =Aden and Radfan= In Aden and Radfan, a number of Scouts were shot down, although these usually resulted in a forced landing and the aircraft were recovered, repaired and returned to service. An example of this occurred on 26 May 1964 when the commanding officer of 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, Lt Col Anthony Farrar-Hockley, used a Scout to reconnoitre the Wadi Dhubsan area, Radfan. The aircraft was hit by enemy fire and the pilot made an emergency landing behind enemy lines. The aircraft was subsequently recovered; Farrar-Hockley rejoined the unit and was awarded the Bar to his Distinguished Service Order for his leadership. Three Scouts were written off during the campaign, the first, XR634, was through pilot error whilst landing on 16 May 1966. Although initially repairable, this aircraft was subsequently damaged beyond economic repair when it was dropped by the RAF Westland Wessex sent to recover it. The second aircraft, XT635, flew into a hillside during a night patrol at Jebal on 5 May 1967, killing the two crew and the two passengers. The third aircraft, XT641, was destroyed on the ground in an incident where the pilotThe Times, 7 September 1967, p.4 and his Foreign Office intelligence officer passenger were captured and shot dead by the National Liberation Front after landing in a wadi bed whilst on a flight from Ataq to Mayfa‚Äôah on 3 September 1967. The NLF then set fire to and destroyed the aircraft. On 1 August 1968, Westland Sioux XT123 crashed at Sharjah, Oman, and was subsequently written off when it was dropped by the Westland Scout that was attempting the recovery. Lt David John Ralls, Royal Corps of Transport, was awarded the DFC for counter-attacking a large group of enemy which had previously attacked an army road repair party on the road to Habilayn. Lt Ralls attack, on 30 May 1967, utilised both the forward-firing and pintle- mounted weapons, forcing the enemy to retreat. Despite his aircraft being hit a number of times, he then directed three Hawker Hunter airstrikes onto the target. =Falklands War= At the start of Operation Corporate, six Scouts from 3 CBAS were operating alongside three machines from No. 656 Squadron AAC. When the 5th Infantry Brigade landed, they were joined by another three Scouts from 656 Squadron. During the Falklands conflict, the Scout was engaged in casualty evacuation, re-supply and special forces insertion roles. One aircraft, XT629, was one of two Scouts of B Flight, 3 CBAS that was attacked by two FMA IA 58 Pucar√°s (the only Argentine air-to-air victory in the war) of Grupo 3 near Camilla Creek House, North of Goose Green. XT629 was hit by cannon fire and crashed, killing the pilot and severing the leg of the crewman, who was thrown clear of the wreckage on impact. The second Scout evaded the Pucar√°s and later returned to the site to evacuate the survivor. Another Scout, XR628, of 656 Sqn AAC, suffered a main rotor gearbox failure whilst in a low hover over MacPhee Pond on 8 June 1982. XR628 had taken cover as two pairs of A-4 Skyhawks from Grupo 5 approached; these aircraft later attacked the RFA landing ships Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram at Bluff Cove. Once the threat had passed and the pilot began to climb away, the main gearbox failed at the main input drive and the aircraft made a forced landing at the lakeside in around four feet of water. The two crew were picked up another 656 Sqn Scout piloted by Capt J G Greenhalgh later that day. The aircraft was eventually recovered and airlifted to Fitzroy by Sea King on 11 June, but was subsequently written off on its return to the UK. XR628 was also the aircraft that was shot down on 26 May 1964, carrying 3 Para's CO, Lt Col Farrar- Hockley. Scouts armed with SS.11 anti-tank missiles were used to great effect during the Falklands campaign. On 14 June 1982, an Argentine 105 mm pack howitzer battery dug in to the West of Stanley Racecourse was firing at the Scots Guards as they approached Mount Tumbledown. As the guns were out of range of the MILAN ATGWs of nearby 2nd battalion Parachute Regiment, their 2IC, Major Chris Keeble, contacted Capt J G Greenhalgh of 656 Sqn AAC on the radio and requested a \\"HELARM\\" using SS.11 missiles to attack them. As he was engaged in ammunition re-supply, his Scout was not fitted with missile booms ‚Äì this was in order to reduce weight and increase the aircraft lift capability. Capt Greenhalgh then returned to Estancia House, where his aircraft was refuelled, fitted out, and armed with four missiles in 20 minutes with the rotors still turning. An 'O' group was then held with the crews of two Scouts of 3 CBAS and Capt Greenhalgh took off on a reconnaissance mission, while the other aircraft were fitted out and readied. Within 20 minutes, he had located the target and carried out a detailed reconnaissance of the area. He fired two missiles at the enemy positions and then returned to a pre-arranged RV to meet up and guide in the other two Scouts. The three aircraft, positioned 100 metres apart, then fired a total of 10 missiles (nine missiles hit, one failed) from the ridge overlooking the Argentine positions 3,000 m away and succeeded in hitting the howitzers, nearby bunkers, an ammunition dump and the command post. The Argentine troops returned mortar fire, a round landing directly in front of Capt Greenhalgh's Scout. =Northern Ireland= In Northern Ireland, the Scout pioneered the use of the Heli-TeleScout fitted with Heli-tele Flight International 1976 aerial surveillance system, having a gyro-stabilised Marconi unit shoe-horned into the rear cabin. The Heli-Tele unit weighed some , although later developments reduced this significantly. The aircraft was also used for mounting Eagle patrols. In this role, the rear cabin doors and seats were removed and four troops sat in the rear cabin with their feet resting on the skids. Operating with two aircraft in unison, this allowed an eight-man patrol to be quickly inserted into an area and mount snap vehicle check points (VCPs) if necessary. Up until 1973, the standard tail rotor colour scheme for the Scout was bands of red and white. On 14 September 1973, a soldier died during training at Gosford Castle, Armagh, after coming into contact with the tail rotor blades whilst the aircraft was on the ground. Following this accident, the tail rotor blade colour scheme was changed to the distinctive black and white bands. Because of the specialist nature of operations in Northern Ireland, a particularly important piece of role equipment was introduced in the form of the \\"Nightsun\\" 3.5 million candlepower searchlight. Operations at night were greatly enhanced with the introduction of night vision goggles, although these missions could still be hazardous. This was evident on the night of 2 December 1978, when the pilot of XW614, 659 Sqn, became disorientated during a sortie and crashed into Lough Ross, killing the two crew.Capt Stirling & Cpl Adcock memorial XW614 was the last of five Scouts written off during operations in the province. =Exports= Unlike its naval counterpart, the Scout did not achieve the same export success as the Wasp, with the Royal Jordanian Air Force acquiring three helicopters, two were operated in Uganda, and Bahrain had two helicopters, which were operated by the Bahrain Public Security Force in police service roles. The Scout never received civilian airworthiness certification, which prevented it from being sold to civilian operators, and meant that the design was used exclusively by the army from the outset. All current operators require an 'Experimental' certificate to fly them. Two Scout helicopters were acquired by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in April 1963 and were operated by 723 Naval Air Squadron, with the aircraft being rotated aboard the hydrographic survey ship HMAS Moresby. The RAN Scouts proved the practicalities of operating helicopters from small ships for the RAN, and the RAN operated these helicopters up until 1973, when they were replaced by Bell 206B-1 Kiowas. The RAN experience with the Scouts aboard HMAS Moresby illustrated the need for a higher-level maintenance regime as a result of operating the helicopters in areas with high concentrations of abrasive coral sand encountered around the Australian coastline and the detrimental effect that it had on the rotor blades, airframe and engine components. Despite the additional effort to maintain the helicopters, the Scouts were considered to be superior to the seaplanes and flying boats that had previously been used in this role. One of the Scouts ditched in Wewak Harbour while taking off from HMAS Moresby in April 1967; it was subsequently recovered but the aircraft was deemed to be written off. =Survivors= Survivor Westland Scout flying in the Royal International Air Tattoo 2015 Although none are operational in military roles, there are still Scouts in the air; mainly in the UK; as of 2014 there were 10 Scouts remaining on the UK civil register, including the Army Air Corps Historic Flight's aircraft. Outside the UK, the last of six Scouts that were exported to New Zealand have been withdrawn from use, leaving only ZS-HAS flying in South Africa operating.

Camp was later found guilty of voluntary vehicular manslaughter and sentenced to ten years' probation. In 2001, he was sentenced to eight years' imprisonment for a variety of parole violations. He was paroled under supervision on July 31, 2006. The homicide and the outcome of the trial against Camp galvanized the punk community and raised accusations about the social tolerance of the Texan city. Brian Deneke Brian Deneke was born in Wichita, Kansas, the younger of two sons to Michael Max \\"Mike\\" Deneke and Elizabeth Louise \\"Betty\\" Bieker. His father was a native of Beloit, Kansas, and was born to Sylvester and Darlene Deneke. Betty Deneke was a native of Concordia, Kansas, and was born to Omer and Marie Bieker. Mike Deneke and Betty Bieker married in 1974 in Concordia, and had two sons: Jason Michael and Brian Theodore. The family settled in southwest Amarillo, Texas from Wichita in winter 1981. Deneke was a dancer in a Boy Scouts troupe during elementary school. He attended Belmar Elementary, Paramount Terrace Elementary, Crockett Middle School, and Amarillo High School in Amarillo. He dropped out of high school during his junior year, and earned his GED at age 17. Deneke was an artist for Stanley Marsh 3's art project, Dynamite Museum, which consisted of handmade mock road signs scattered across Amarillo city streets. Deneke was also the vocalist of punk rock group The White Slave Traders, and aspired to become a famous punk rock musician. Deneke was remembered by his friends as being friendly, charismatic and seen as a leader in local punk circles, helping to organize many local musical events. Nicknamed \\"Sunshine\\", Deneke had a spiked mohawk hairstyle and often wore a black leather jacket with a studded leather collar and sported homemade tattoos. He was also an enthusiastic skateboarder, and it was this interest which drew him into the punk subculture. Like other punks in Amarillo, Deneke had suffered frequent harassment and bullying, and acquired nicknames such as \\"Punch\\" and \\"Fist Magnet\\" by tormenters. His parents were against their son's lifestyle, and warned him of possible prejudice from people in Amarillo. Death The International House of Pancakes across the street from the Western Plaza Shopping Center was a popular hangout for youths in Amarillo, Texas. On Saturday, December 6, 1997, a confrontation occurred at the IHOP involving Dustin Camp, an honor student and star football player for Tascosa High School in Amarillo, and John King, a member of the punk rock community. One witness, Kendra Petitt, claims that Camp hopped the median in his Cadillac as he tried to run the punks down in the parking lot, and that Camp missed and instead had his car window smashed by John King's police baton. Camp and friends denied this event ever happened. Tension and resentment from this confrontation lingered among the respective groups for the following week. After a night of heavy drinking on Friday, December 12, 1997, Dustin Camp and his companions returned to the Western Plaza Shopping Center at 11:00 p.m., anticipating a fight with members of the punk community. Violence soon broke out between jocks and punks outside of the IHOP restaurant. During the fight Dustin Camp retreated into his Cadillac; at first Camp appeared to drive away but then he sharply turned back, targeting Deneke by running him over. Camp's attorney would later argue that Camp returned to defend a fellow jock; however, this claim was denied by Deneke's companions. Trial of Dustin Camp During Camp's murder trial, a passenger eyewitness testified that Camp exclaimed \\"I'm a Ninja in my Caddy!\\" as he targeted Deneke and then \\"I bet he liked that one!\\" after he ran over Deneke as he sped away from the scene. Dustin Camp was charged with first-degree murder; during his trial his defense claimed that he had acted in defense of a friend whom Deneke was attacking. Camp's defense attorney, Warren L. Clark, defended by trying to shift the blame on Deneke and the punk community. Clark portrayed the punks as violent thugs and went as far as calling them \\"armed goons\\". Defense attorney Clark used incidents from Deneke's past that made him look violent, and claimed that he was the aggressor on the night of his death. The defense also claimed that witnesses for the prosecution were punks who lied under oath. In contrast to the punks, the defense characterized the alleged murderer as a wholesome and clean-cut youth. The defense emphasized Camp's normalcy, claiming Camp was a good Christian, a good Texan, and a football player. The punks who testified consistently saw Deneke as the victim. One of Camp's companions, who was a passenger in his car, also incriminated him. She did not see him acting in defense of a third person and testified on the \\"Ninja in the Caddy\\" exclamations. Although Camp had been charged with murder, the jury only found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced him to ten years' probation and a $10,000 fine. Both Camp's attorney and the district attorney found this sentence to be uncommonly mild. The jury refused to comment after the trial, citing the welfare of the families. Alternate juror Wade Colvin said he was \\"completely surprised\\" that the jury did not convict Camp of murder and opted for a manslaughter conviction instead. \\"What stuck with me more than anything‚ÄîI felt like Brian was running away and Dustin had a chance [to stop his car],\\" Colvin said. He believed the jury gave Camp a second chance because of his youth. \\"I had those thoughts, too, about him being so young,\\" Colvin said, \\"but he did wrong.\\" =Camp's probation violations= In June 2001 Camp was apprehended for underage drinking and was arrested for being a minor in the possession of alcohol. Michael Camp, father of Dustin, attempted to cover for his son's probation violations. Michael Camp was formally charged with making false statements to the police. He was sentenced to 60 days' deferred adjudication (a type of probation) and a US$100 fine after a plea bargain. In September 2001, Dustin Camp received an eight-year prison sentence for violating his probation. Dustin's brother David was also arrested during the June events. He served one year of probation for providing alcohol to minors and hindering police efforts to arrest Dustin Camp. In 2006 Dustin Camp was paroled under supervision until his sentence expired in 2009. Media coverage and significance Deneke's funeral service was held at St. Mary's Catholic Church on December 16, 1997, in Amarillo. His death shook Amarillo and horrified the punk subculture. Punks in Amarillo reported that they had often been targets of abuse and harassment by jocks because of their differences, even before the incident; after the trial there was a general feeling that Camp walked free because he was seen as a \\"good kid\\", unlike the punks. The lenient sentence for Camp caused a public outcry in Amarillo and incited a debate on whether the city was a tolerant place. The mayor of Amarillo, Kel Seliger, attempted to distance the town from the verdict. \\"It was not a community verdict,\\" he said, \\"it was 12 people.\\" Nonetheless, the murder trial had prompted the mayor to emphasize tolerance for differences and mutual respect. Deneke's father was unsurprised by the lenient verdict: \\"Quite honestly,\\" Deneke's father said, \\"we had been prepared for that. If you pay attention to what happens in the criminal justice system, it's not unusual\\". National television and radio paid attention to the case in 1999 and 2000 being featured on Leeza, Dateline NBC, 20/20, NPR, (RealAudio .RAM file) and in an MTV documentary, Criminal \\"Punks vs Preps\\". The widely syndicated City Confidential episode \\"Amarillo, TX: High School Hit & Run\\" in 2005 reinforced interest in the case. In 2000, musician Marilyn Manson discussed the Deneke case at the Disinfo conference while addressing the issue of the causes of youth violence. The conflict between jocks and punks in Amarillo has been compared to the widespread social divisions in Columbine High School which have been said to contribute to the Columbine High School massacre.Jane Bluestein, Creating Emotionally Safe Schools: A Guide for Educators and Parents(HCI, 2001) p. 157 The Deneke case has also been referred to briefly in an academic article arguing the case for expanding the definitions of bias crime beyond the usual boundaries of religious, sexual and racial groups, to other social groupings.M. Blake, \\"Geeks and Monsters: Bias Crimes and Social Identity\\" Law and Philosophy, Volume 20, Number 2, March 2001 , pp. 121-139 Tributes to Brian Deneke =Concerts= Numerous tribute gigs and concerts have been made for Deneke since his death. In 2000, The Unity Through Diversity festival was held in Amarillo featuring The Undead and Mike Watt, amongst other bands. The tenth anniversary of his death demonstrated the ongoing significance of his death to the punk community with 25 concerts being held on December 8, 2007 across the United States and Canada, including concerts in New York City, Chicago, Seattle and five concerts across Texas including a two-day event in Amarillo. Half of the money raised by these events went to National Organization for Parents of Murdered Children, the other half to various anti prejudice causes. The memorial concerts stated aims were: \\"Brian was only 19 years old when he succumbed to violent death due to prejudice and ignorance. The Memorial events will donate our profits to charities that fight hate-crime. Brian's existence will continue to inspire others.\\" =Songs= Deneke's death has been the subject of a number of songs, including: *\\"Brian's Song\\" by Fifteen *\\"Brian's Song\\" by The Code *\\"Tears On A Pillow (in Amarillo)\\" by The Undead *\\"Fortunes of War\\" by Dropkick Murphys *\\"Sunshine Fist Magnet\\" by Against All Authority *\\"A Punk Killed\\" and \\"Murdered\\" by Total Chaos *\\"American Justice Is All a Lie\\" by Career Soldiers *\\"Sunshine\\" by The Swellers *\\"Hail\\" by Hamell on Trial *\\"Brian Deneke\\" by Christopher Owens =Drama= A play about the Deneke case, Manslaughtered, by David Bucci, was performed at the Annex Theatre, Seattle in 2000. =Film= A film about Brian Deneke's short life has been made called Bomb City, named after Amarillo's nickname as a nuclear weapons disassembly site.

The monument in the now non-existent village of Huta Pieniacka in Lviv region in western Ukraine was erected in memory of the hundreds of people who lived in the then Polish village and were brutally killed in 1944 by a police regiment. On the 9th of January 2017 the Monument to Polish Victims of World War II Massacre was vandalized. A cross made of stone was blown up, while two stone tables with the names of the Poles killed during the 1944 massacre were damaged allegedly by vandals from russian \\"People's Liberation Movement\\" who were one the first who published video of destroyed monument.

The parish covered an area of and had a population of 270 in 116 households at the 2001 census, the population increasing to 289 at the 2011 Census. On the 1st of April 2019 the parish was merged with Bixley to form Caistor St Edmund and Bixley. The remains of a Roman market town and capital of the Iceni tribe, Venta Icenorum, are nearby (British National Grid ref TG230034). The ruins are in the care of the Norfolk Archaeological Trust and managed by South Norfolk Council. It is assumed that the Roman 'Stone Street' runs from Dunwich on the Suffolk coast to Caistor St Edmund near Norwich. The parish church of St Edmund's lies at the south-east corner of the old Roman town. Caistor St Edmund features on the Antonine Itinerary, a Roman \\"road map\\" of the routes around Britain. Caistor Old Hall was built in 1612 for Thomas Pettus. During the 19th century it was owned by John Spurrell (son of William Spurrell, of Thurgarton, Norfolk). The River Tas passes under Markshall bridge, just north of the Roman camp, and then flows on towards Arminghall and Trowse. The village has one hotel, Caistor Hall Hotel, a fine example of Georgian building constructed between 1795 and 1797 by the Dashwood family. The actual site can be traced back even further to before the Norman Conquest and originally belonged to the Abbey at Bury St Edmunds until it was confiscated during the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Caistor Manor and land then passed to the Godslave family who owned it until the early 1600s and then in turn to the Pettus family. Through marriage the land became the property of the Dashwoods in 1793. The first recorded owner was Horatio Dashwood who lived in the hall with his wife Harriet and their children.http://www.caistorhall.com/ In fiction English comedic character Alan Partridge was married in the church.

The incident received widespread publicity as part of the increasing debate about political correctness in the United States in the 1990s. History The incident occurred on January 13, 1993, when Eden Jacobowitz shouted, \\"Shut up, you water buffalo! If you're looking for a party, there's a zoo a mile from here,\\" out of his window to a crowd of mostly black Delta Sigma Theta sorority sisters making noise outside his dorm. Others had shouted at the crowd, but Jacobowitz was the only one charged. Initially Jacobowitz had an advisor assigned to him, who urged him to accept the University's offer of a settlement. The settlement required him to admit to violating the racial harassment policy. Instead, he contested the university's decision under the advice of Penn history professor and libertarian activist Alan Charles Kors. Jacobowitz explained his choice of \\"water buffalo\\" as from Hebrew slang \\"behema\\" (animal or beast, see also behemoth), used by Israelis to refer to a loud, rowdy person. He procured several expert witnesses who attested to this and others, such as Michael Meyers, President and Executive Director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, who gave testimonies that \\"water buffalo\\" was not a racial epithet against African Americans. Jacobowitz's story was brought to the fore by the media focus on Penn. On April 23, several days before his hearing, the New York-based Jewish Daily Forward broke his story with the headline \\"Pennsylvania Preparing to Buffalo a Yeshiva Boy\\". The story gained even wider media coverage after The Wall Street Journal picked up the story with an editorial entitled \\"Buffaloed at Penn\\" on April 26. Jacobowitz was interviewed on television several times. Based on testimony that Jacobowitz had called the women \\"water buffalo\\" and the university's belief that this was a racial epithet, it proceeded with prosecuting him. On May 13, 1993, news anchor John Chancellor had the following commentary: > Eden Jacobowitz is a student at the University of Pennsylvania. His studies > were interrupted by a noisy crowd of students, many black and female. He > yelled out his window, \\"Shut up, you water buffalo.\\" He is now charged with > racial harassment under the university's Code of Conduct. The school offered > to dismiss the charge if he would apologize, attend a racial sensitivity > seminar, agree to dormitory probation, and accept a temporary mark on his > record which would brand him as guilty. He was told the term \\"water buffalo\\" > could be interpreted as racist because a water buffalo is a dark primitive > animal that lives in Africa. That is questionable semantics, dubious > zoology, and incorrect geography. Water buffalo live in Asia, not in Africa. > This from the University of Pennsylvania. Mr. Jacobowitz is fighting back. > The rest of us, however, are still in trouble. The language police are at > work on the campuses of our better schools. The word cops are marching under > the banner of political correctness. The culture of victimization is hunting > for quarry. American English is in danger of losing its muscle and energy. > That's what these bozos are doing to us Vernon Jordan offered a dissenting viewpoint years later when he wrote \\"the participant in the white mob became a hero for the right wing, while the four black women remained faceless and the objects of national ridicule.\\" University President Sheldon Hackney argued that the incident \\"was hijacked for ideological purposes\\" and that dismissing the phrase as harmless \\"ignores the long history of animalistic representations of African Americans as part of white supremacy's mind game [and] ignores the question of what the women thought they heard and why they got so angry.\\" Although the incident prompted widespread media coverage, the University did not discuss its actions. The hearing was delayed for another two months while international press commented and criticized Penn's decisions. Garry Trudeau devoted a Sunday's Doonesbury to the water buffalo incident.Trudeau, Garry. Doonesbury Comic Strip, July 11 1993 . GoComics.com. Retrieved 6 March 2010. The University declined repeated requests by Jacobowitz's legal teams to have charges dropped. At the hearing the panel decided not to dismiss the charges and issued a gag order to keep proceedings from leaking to the press. Amid public scrutiny, the University denied issuing a gag order, and Sheldon Hackney offered Kors a deal in which Jacobowitz would apologize for rudeness and the University and the plaintiffs would drop the charges. The affair ended when at a press conference the 15 women agreed to drop charges, stating that the media coverage made it unlikely they would get a fair hearing. The University stated there were no charges pending. A second student, Jacobowitz's roommate, was also charged by the university and placed on probation for his part in the original midnight ruckus.

The film was co-produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and Universal Pictures. It stars Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Ralf M√∂ller, Oliver Reed (in his final role), Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, and Richard Harris. Crowe portrays Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when Commodus, the ambitious son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus becomes a gladiator and rises through the ranks of the arena to avenge the murders of his family and his emperor. Inspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 book Those About to Die (formerly titled The Way of the Gladiator), the film's script, initially written by Franzoni, was acquired by DreamWorks and Ridley Scott signed on to direct the film. Principal photography began in January 1999, before the script was completed, and wrapped up in May of that year, with the scenes of Ancient Rome shot over a period of nineteen weeks in Fort Ricasoli, Malta. The film's computer-generated imagery effects were created by British post-production company The Mill, who also created a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving Reed's character Proximo due to Reed dying of a heart attack during production. Gladiator premiered in Los Angeles on May 1, 2000, and was released theatrically in the United States on May 5 and in the United Kingdom on May 11. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, with praise for the acting (particularly Crowe's and Phoenix's performances), Scott's direction, visuals, screenplay, action sequences, musical score and the production values. It was a box office success, grossing $187.7 million in the United States and grossed $457 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of 2000. The film won multiple awards, including five Academy Awards at the 73rd Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor for Crowe, Best Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects. It also received four BAFTA Awards at the 54th British Academy Film Awards for Best Film, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design and Best Editing. Since its release, Gladiator has also been credited with reinventing the swords and sandals genre and rekindling interest in entertainment centered around ancient Greek and ancient Roman culture such as the TV series Rome. Plot In AD 180, Hispano-Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius intends to return to his home after he leads the Roman army to victory against the Germanic tribes near Vindobona on the Limes Germanicus. Emperor Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that his own son, Commodus, is unfit to rule, and that he wishes Maximus to succeed him, as regent, to help save Rome from corruption and restore the Roman Republic. Commodus, upon hearing this, murders his father. Commodus proclaims himself the new emperor and asks Maximus for his loyalty, but Maximus refuses. Maximus is arrested by the Praetorian Guard and is told that he and his family will die. He kills his captors, although not without injury, and rides for his home near Trujillo, where he finds his home destroyed and his family murdered. Maximus buries his wife and son, then collapses from his injuries. He is found by slavers who take him to the city of Zucchabar in the Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis, where he is sold to a gladiator trainer named Proximo. Although reluctant at first, Maximus fights in local tournaments and befriends two other gladiators: Juba, a Numidian; and Hagen, a German. His military skills help him win matches and gain recognition from other gladiators and the crowd. Proximo reveals that he was once a gladiator who was freed by Marcus Aurelius, and advises Maximus that he must \\"win the crowd\\" to win his freedom. When Commodus organizes 150 days of games, Proximo takes his gladiators to fight in Rome's Colosseum. Disguised by a masked helmet, Maximus debuts in gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum as a Carthaginian in a re-enactment of the Battle of Zama. Unexpectedly, Maximus leads his side to victory, and Commodus enters the Colosseum to offer his congratulations. He orders the disguised Maximus, as leader of the gladiators, to show himself and give his name; Maximus reveals himself and declares vengeance. Commodus is compelled by the crowd to let the gladiators live, and his guards are held back from striking them down. Maximus's next fight is against a legendary undefeated gladiator named Tigris of Gaul. Commodus has arranged for several tigers to be set upon Maximus during the duel; Maximus, however, prevails. Commodus orders Maximus to kill Tigris, but Maximus spares his opponent's life; he is called \\"Maximus the Merciful\\" by the crowd. Angered at this outcome, Commodus taunts Maximus about his family's deaths, but Maximus turns and walks away. Maximus discovers from Cicero, his ex-orderly, that his former legions remain loyal. Lucilla, Commodus's sister; Gracchus, an influential senator; and Maximus meet secretly. Maximus will escape Rome, join his soldiers, topple Commodus by force, and hand power back to the Roman Senate. Commodus learns of the plot when Lucilla's son, Lucius, innocently hints at the conspiracy. Commodus threatens Lucilla and Lucius, and has the Praetorian Guard arrest Gracchus and attack the gladiators' barracks. Proximo and his men, including Hagen, sacrifice themselves to enable Maximus to escape. Maximus is captured at the rendezvous with Cicero, where the latter is killed. In an effort to win back the people's approval, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in the Colosseum. He stabs Maximus before the match to gain an advantage. Despite his injuries, Maximus disarms Commodus, whom the Praetorian Guard refuse to aid. Commodus then produces a hidden knife, which Maximus drives into Commodus's throat, killing him. Maximus succumbs to his wounds. Before he dies, he asks for political reforms, for his gladiator allies to be freed, and for Senator Gracchus to be reinstated. Maximus's friends and allies honor him as \\"a soldier of Rome\\", at Lucilla's behest, and carry his body out of the arena, leaving the dead Commodus behind. Juba visits the Colosseum at night and buries the figurines of Maximus's wife and son at the spot where he died. Juba promises to see Maximus again, \\"but not yet\\". Cast * Russell Crowe as Maximus Decimus Meridius: A Hispano-Roman legatus forced into becoming a slave who seeks revenge against Commodus. He has earned the favor of Marcus Aurelius, and the love and admiration of Lucilla prior to the events of the film. His home is near Trujillo in today's Province of C√°ceres, Spain. After the murder of his family he vows vengeance. Mel Gibson was first offered the role, but declined as he felt he was too old to play the character. Antonio Banderas and Hugh Jackman were also considered. * Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus: The amoral, power-hungry, embittered son of Marcus Aurelius. He murders his father when he learns that Maximus will hold the emperor's powers in trust until a new republic can be formed. * Connie Nielsen as Lucilla: Maximus's former lover and the older child of Marcus Aurelius. Lucilla has been recently widowed. She resists her brother's incestuous advances, while protecting her son, Lucius, from her brother's corruption and wrath. * Oliver Reed as Antonius Proximo: An old, gruff gladiator trainer who buys Maximus in North Africa. A former gladiator himself, he was freed by Marcus Aurelius and becomes a mentor to Maximus. This was Reed's final film appearance, as he died during the filming. In the original film script, Proximo was supposed to live. * Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus: A member of the Roman Senate who opposes Commodus's rule and an ally of Lucilla and Maximus. * Djimon Hounsou as Juba: A Numidian tribesman who was taken from his home and family by slave traders.

He is murdered by his son Commodus before his wish can be fulfilled. * Ralf M√∂ller as Hagen: A Germanic warrior and Proximo's chief gladiator who later befriends Maximus and Juba during their battles in Rome. He is killed by the Praetorian Guard during Maximus's attempted escape from Rome. * Tommy Flanagan as Cicero: Maximus's loyal servant who provides liaison between the enslaved Maximus, his former legion based at Ostia, and Lucilla. He is used as bait for the escaping Maximus and eventually killed by the Praetorian Guard. * David Schofield as Senator Falco: A Patrician, a senator opposed to Gracchus. He helps Commodus to consolidate his power. * John Shrapnel as Senator Gaius: A Roman senator allied with Gracchus, Lucilla, and Maximus against Commodus. * Tomas Arana as General Quintus: A Roman legatus, commander of the Praetorian Guard, who betrays Maximus by allying with Commodus.

Production =Development and pre-production= Gladiator was based on an original pitch by David Franzoni, who wrote the first draft. Franzoni was given a three-picture deal with DreamWorks as writer and co- producer on the strength of his previous work, Steven Spielberg's Amistad, which helped establish the reputation of DreamWorks. Not a classical scholar, Franzoni was inspired by Daniel P. Mannix's 1958 novel Those About to Die, and he chose to base his story on Commodus after reading the Augustan History. In Franzoni's first draft, dated April 4, 1998, he named his protagonist Narcissus, a wrestler who, according to the ancient sources Herodian and Cassius Dio, strangled Emperor Commodus to death. Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down) by Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me, the 19th-century painting that inspired Ridley Scott to tackle the project. Ridley Scott was approached by producers Walter F. Parkes and Douglas Wick. They showed him a copy of Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me's 1872 painting entitled Pollice Verso (Thumbs Down). Scott was enticed by filming the world of Ancient Rome. However, Scott felt Franzoni's dialogue was too \\"on the nose\\" (lacking subtlety) and hired John Logan to rewrite the script to his liking. Logan rewrote much of the first act and made the decision to kill off Maximus's family to increase the character's motivation. Russell Crowe describes being eager for the role as pitched by Parkes, in his interview for Inside the Actors Studio: \\"They said, 'It's a 100-million-dollar film. You're being directed by Ridley Scott. You play a Roman General.' I've always been a big fan of Ridley's.\\" With two weeks to go before filming, the actors complained of problems with the script. William Nicholson was brought to Shepperton Studios to make Maximus a more sensitive character. Nicholson reworked Maximus' friendship with Juba and developed the afterlife thread in the film, saying, \\"he did not want to see a film about a man who wanted to kill somebody.\\" The screenplay faced many rewrites and revisions, with several actors providing changes. Crowe allegedly questioned every aspect of the evolving script and strode off the set when he did not get answers. According to a DreamWorks executive, Crowe \\"tried to rewrite the entire script on the spot. You know the big line in the trailer, 'In this life or the next, I will have my vengeance'? At first he absolutely refused to say it.\\" Crowe described the script situation: \\"I read the script and it was substantially underdone. Even the character didn't exist on the pages. And that set about a long process, that's probably the first time that I've been in a situation where the script wasn't a complete done deal. We actually started shooting with about 32 pages and went through them in the first couple of weeks.\\" Of the writing and filming process, Crowe added, \\"Possibly, a lot of the stuff that I have to deal with now in terms of my 'volatility' has to do with that experience. Here was a situation where we got to Morocco with a crew of 200 and a cast of a 100 or whatever, and I didn't have anything to learn. I actually didn't know what the scenes were gonna be. We had, I think, one American writer working on it, one English writer working on it, and of course a group of producers who were also adding their ideas, and then Ridley himself; and then, on the occasion where Ridley would say, 'Look, this is the structure for it ‚Äì what are you gonna say in that?' So then I'd be doing my own stuff, as well. And this is how things like, 'Strength and honor,' came up. This is how things like, 'At my signal, unleash hell,' came up. The name Maximus Decimus Meridius, it just flowed well.\\" Maximus' habit of rubbing soil before each fight references the attachment and affection to his former life as a farmer. In a conversation with Marcus Aurelius, Maximus says the fecund soil of his farm is \\"black like my wife's hair\\". Crowe wrote the speech himself, drawing on his feelings of homesickness for his own farm. In preparation for filming, Scott spent several months developing storyboards to develop the framework of the plot. Over six weeks, production members scouted various locations within the extent of the Roman Empire before its collapse, including Italy, France, North Africa, and England. All of the film's props, sets, and costumes were manufactured by crew members due to high costs and unavailability of the items. =Filming= The film was shot in three main locations between January and May 1999. The opening battle scenes in the forests of Germania were shot in three weeks in the Bourne Woods, near Farnham, Surrey, in England. When Scott learned that the Forestry Commission planned to remove a section of the forest, he persuaded them to allow the battle scene to be shot there and burn it down. Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson used multiple cameras filming at various frame rates and a 45-degree shutter, creating stop motion effects in the action sequences, similar to techniques used for the battle sequences of Saving Private Ryan (1998). Subsequently, the scenes of slavery, desert travel, and gladiatorial training school were shot in Ouarzazate, Morocco, just south of the Atlas Mountains over a further three weeks. To construct the arena where Maximus has his first fights, the crew used basic materials and local building techniques to manufacture the 30,000-seat mud brick arena. Finally, the scenes of Ancient Rome were shot over a period of nineteen weeks in Fort Ricasoli, Malta. In Malta, a replica of about one-third of Rome's Colosseum was built, to a height of 52 feet (15.8 meters), mostly from plaster and plywood (the other two- thirds and remaining height were added digitally). The replica took several months to build and cost an estimated $1 million.Winkler, p.130 The reverse side of the complex supplied a rich assortment of Ancient Roman street furniture, colonnades, gates, statuary, and marketplaces for other filming requirements. The complex was serviced by tented \\"costume villages\\" that had changing rooms, storage, armorers, and other facilities. The rest of the Colosseum was created in computer-generated imagery using set-design blueprints and textures referenced from live action, and rendered in three layers to provide lighting flexibility for compositing in Flame and Inferno software. =Post-production= Several scenes included extensive use of computer-generated imagery shots for views of Rome. British post-production company The Mill was responsible for much of the computer-generated imagery effects that were added after filming. The company was responsible for such tricks as compositing real tigers filmed on bluescreen into the fight sequences, and adding smoke trails and extending the flight paths of the opening scene's salvo of flaming arrows to get around regulations on how far they could be shot during filming. They also used 2,000 live actors to create a computer-generated crowd of 35,000 virtual actors that had to look believable and react to fight scenes. The Mill accomplished this by shooting live actors at different angles giving various performances, and then mapping them onto cards, with motion-capture tools used to track their movements for three-dimensional compositing. The Mill created over 90 visual effects shots, comprising approximately nine minutes of the film's running time. An unexpected post-production job was caused by the death of Oliver Reed of a heart attack during the filming in Malta, before all his scenes had been shot. The Mill created a digital body double for the remaining scenes involving his character Proximo by photographing a live-action body double in the shadows and by mapping a three-dimensional computer-generated imagery mask of Reed's face to the remaining scenes during production at an estimated cost of $3.2 million for two minutes of additional footage. Visual effects supervisor John Nelson reflected on the decision to include the additional footage: \\"What we did was small compared to our other tasks on the film. What Oliver did was much greater. He gave an inspiring, moving performance. All we did was help him finish it.\\" The film is dedicated to Reed's memory.Schwartz, p.142 Historical authenticity The film is loosely based on real events that occurred within the Roman Empire in the latter half of the 2nd century AD. As Ridley Scott wanted to portray Roman culture more accurately than in any previous film, he hired several historians as advisors. Nevertheless, some deviations from historical fact were made to increase interest, maintain narrative continuity, and for practical or safety reasons. Scott also stated that due to the influence of previous films affecting the public perception of what ancient Rome was like, some historical facts were \\"too unbelievable\\" to include. For instance in an early version of the script, gladiators would have been carrying out product endorsements in the arena; while this would have been historically accurate, it was not filmed for fear that audiences would think it anachronistic.Not Such a Wonderful Life: A Look at History in Gladiator IGN movies February 10, 2000 At least one historical advisor resigned due to these changes. Another asked not to be mentioned in the credits (though it was stated in the director's commentary that he constantly asked, \\"where is the proof that certain things were exactly like they say?\\"). Historian Allen Ward of the University of Connecticut believed that historical accuracy would not have made Gladiator less interesting or exciting, stating, \\"creative artists need to be granted some poetic license, but that should not be a permit for the wholesale disregard of facts in historical fiction\\". =Fictionalization= * Marcus Aurelius was not murdered by his son Commodus; he died at Vindobona (modern Vienna) in 180 AD from the Antonine Plague. The epidemic, believed to be either smallpox or measles, swept the Roman Empire during the reign of Marcus. * There is no indication Marcus Aurelius wished to return the Empire to a republican form of government, as depicted in the film. Moreover, he shared the rule of the Empire with Commodus for three years before his own death. Commodus then ruled alone from that point until his death at the end of 192 AD. * The film depicts Marcus as defeating the barbarians in the Marcomannic Wars. In reality the war was still ongoing when Aurelius died; Commodus secured peace by a treaty with the two Germanic tribes allied against Rome, the Marcomanni and the Quadi, immediately after his father's death. * The character of Maximus is fictional, although in some respects he resembles the historical figures Narcissus (Commodus's real-life murderer and the character's name in the first draft of the screenplay), Spartacus (who led a significant slave revolt in 73‚Äì71 BC), Cincinnatus (519‚Äì430 BC) (a farmer who was made dictator, saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month appointment after 15 days),Livy. Cincinnatus Leaves His Plow. Taken from The Western World and Marcus Nonius Macrinus (a trusted general, Consul in 154 AD, and friend of Marcus Aurelius). * Although Commodus engaged in show combat in the Colosseum, he was not killed in the arena; he was strangled in his bath by the wrestler Narcissus. Commodus reigned for over twelve years, unlike the shorter period portrayed in the film. * In the film, Lucilla is portrayed as a lone widow of Lucius Verus with one son, also named Lucius Verus. While Lucilla was the widow of Verus and also had a son by that name, their son died young, long before the reign of Commodus, and Lucilla remarried Claudius Pompeianus soon after Verus' death.Peacock, Phoebe B., Library of Congress, Lucius Verus (161‚Äì169 AD) , roman-emperors.org. Accessed 2012-5-29. She had been married to him for 11 years by the time her brother became Emperor. The film omits Lucilla's other two children with Verus, Lucilla Plautia and Aurelia Lucilla. * The character of Maximus had a similar career (and personality traits as documented by Herodian) to Claudius Pompeianus (a Syrian) who married Marcus Aurelius' daughter Lucilla following the death of Lucius Verus. It is believed Aurelius may have wanted Pompeianus to succeed him as Caesar, in preference to Commodus, but was turned down. Pompeianus had no part in any of the many plots against Commodus. He was not depicted in the film. * Lucilla was implicated in a plot to assassinate her brother in 182 AD, along with her stepson by Pompeianus and several others. She was first exiled to the island of Capri by her brother, then executed on his orders later in the year. * In the film the character Antonius Proximo claims \\"the wise\\" Marcus Aurelius banned gladiatorial games in Rome forcing him to move to Mauretania. The real Aurelius did ban the games, but only in Antioch as punishment for the city's support of the usurper Avidius Cassius. No games were ever banned in Rome. However, when the Emperor started conscripting gladiators into the legions, the resulting shortage in fighters allowed lanistae such as Proximo to make \\"windfall\\" profits through increased charges for their services. * In real life, the death of Commodus did not result in a peace for Rome, nor a return to the Roman Republic. Rather, it ushered in a chaotic and bloody power struggle that culminated in the Year of the Five Emperors of AD 193. According to Herodian, the people of Rome were overjoyed at the news of Commodus dying, although they feared that the praetorians would not accept the new emperor Pertinax. =Anachronisms= Costumes in the film are rarely historically correct. Some of the soldiers wear fantasy helmets. The bands wrapped around their lower arms were rarely worn. Their appearance is the product of a filmic stereotype whereby historical films depict peoples of antiquity wearing such bands. Although the film is set within the 2nd century AD, the Imperial Gallic armor and the helmets worn by the legionaries are from AD 75, a century earlier. This was superseded by new designs in AD 100. The legions' standard bearers (Aquilifer), centurions, mounted forces, and auxiliaries would have worn scale armour, lorica squamata. The Germanic tribes are dressed in clothes from the Stone Age period.Junkelmann, Marcus in Hollywoods Traum von Rom (Hollywood's Dream of Rome), p. 117, 120 and 195. Roman field artillery used in open battle was far more compact and transportable than shown by the film. But it was indeed capable of creating \\"killing zones\\" with a low chance of survival, as proven by tightly spaced impacts on a real battlefield. The Roman cavalry are shown using stirrups. This is anachronistic in that the horse-mounted forces of the Roman army used a two-horned saddle, without stirrups. Stirrups were only employed in filming for safety reasons because of the additional training and skill required to ride with a Roman saddle. Catapults and ballistae would not have been used in a forest. They were reserved primarily for sieges and were rarely used in open battles. Fire arrows and canisters fired from catapults were not used at any point in ancient history. The Praetorian Guards seen in the film are all wearing purple uniforms. No historical evidence supports this. On campaign they usually wore standard legionary equipment with some unique decorative elements. In the bird's eye view of Rome when the city is introduced for the first time there are several buildings that did not exist at the time of Gladiator. For example, the Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine is quite prominent, though it was not completed until AD 312. Early in the story, Commodus regards a statue in his father's tent; the statue has no pupils, a trait commonly seen in fiction about the Roman Empire. In fact, most statues were thought to have painted eyes and pupils at the time when they were created; it was only through the passage of time that the paint would have worn off, leaving the statues with their blank stares. Influences The film's plot was influenced by two 1960s Hollywood films of the sword-and-sandal genre, The Fall of the Roman Empire and Spartacus, and shares several plot points with The Fall of the Roman Empire, which tells the story of Livius, who, like Maximus in Gladiator, is Marcus Aurelius's intended successor. Livius is in love with Lucilla and seeks to marry her while Maximus, who is happily married, was formerly in love with her. Both films portray the death of Marcus Aurelius as an assassination. In Fall of the Roman Empire a group of conspirators independent of Commodus, hoping to profit from Commodus's accession, arrange for Marcus Aurelius to be poisoned; in Gladiator Commodus himself murders his father by smothering him. In the course of Fall of the Roman Empire Commodus unsuccessfully seeks to win Livius over to his vision of empire in contrast to that of his father, but continues to employ him notwithstanding; in Gladiator, when Commodus fails to secure Maximus's allegiance, he executes Maximus's wife and son and tries unsuccessfully to execute him. Livius in Fall of the Roman Empire and Maximus in Gladiator kill Commodus in single combat, Livius to save Lucilla and Maximus to avenge the murder of his wife and son, and both do it for the greater good of Rome. Scott cited Spartacus and Ben-Hur as influences on the film: \\"These movies were part of my cinema-going youth. But at the dawn of the new millennium, I thought this might be the ideal time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the last two thousand years ‚Äì if not all recorded history ‚Äì the apex and beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political power the world has ever known.\\" Spartacus provides the film's gladiatorial motif, as well as the character of Senator Gracchus, a fictitious senator (bearing the name of a pair of revolutionary Tribunes from the 2nd century BC) who in both films is an elder statesman of ancient Rome attempting to preserve the ancient rights of the Roman Senate in the face of an ambitious autocrat ‚Äì Marcus Licinius Crassus in Spartacus and Commodus in Gladiator. Both actors who played Gracchus (in Spartacus and Gladiator), played Claudius in previous films ‚Äì Charles Laughton of Spartacus played Claudius in the unfinished 1937 film I, Claudius and Sir Derek Jacobi of Gladiator, played Claudius in the 1976 BBC adaptation. Both films also share a specific set piece, wherein a gladiator (Maximus here, Woody Strode's Draba in Spartacus) throws his weapon into a spectator box at the end of a match, as well as at least one line of dialogue: \\"Rome is the mob\\", said here by Gracchus and by Julius Caesar (John Gavin) in Spartacus. The film's depiction of Commodus's entry into Rome borrows imagery from Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will (1935), although Scott has pointed out that the iconography of Nazi rallies was itself inspired by the Roman Empire. Gladiator reflects back on the film by duplicating similar events that occurred in Adolf Hitler's procession. The Nazi film opens with an aerial view of Hitler arriving in a plane, while Scott shows an aerial view of Rome, quickly followed by a shot of the large crowd of people watching Commodus pass them in a procession with his chariot.Winkler, p.114 The first thing to appear in Triumph of the Will is a Nazi eagle, which is alluded to when a statue of an eagle sits atop one of the arches (and then is shortly followed by several more decorative eagles throughout the rest of the scene) leading up to the procession of Commodus. At one point in the Nazi film, a little girl gives flowers to Hitler, while Commodus is met by several girls who all give him bundles of flowers.Winkler, p.115 Music The Oscar-nominated score was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, and conducted by Gavin Greenaway. Zimmer was originally planning to use Israeli vocalist Ofra Haza for the score, after his work with her in The Prince of Egypt. However, Haza died in late February 2000, before she was able to record, and so Gerrard was chosen instead. Lisa Gerrard's vocals are similar to her own work on The Insider score. The music for many of the battle scenes has been noted as similar to Gustav Holst's \\"Mars: The Bringer of War\\", and in June 2006, the Holst Foundation sued Hans Zimmer for allegedly copying the late Holst's work. Another close musical resemblance occurs in the scene of Commodus's triumphal entry into Rome, accompanied by music clearly evocative of two sections ‚Äì the Prelude to Das Rheingold and Siegfried's Funeral March from G√∂tterd√§mmerung ‚Äì from Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung. On February 27, 2001, nearly a year after the first soundtrack's release, Decca produced Gladiator: More Music From the Motion Picture. Then, on September 5, 2005, Decca produced Gladiator: Special Anniversary Edition, a two-CD pack containing both the above-mentioned releases. Some of the music from the film was featured in the NFL playoffs in January 2003 before commercial breaks and before and after half-time.Winkler, p.141 In 2003, Luciano Pavarotti released a recording of himself singing a song from the film and said he regretted turning down an offer to perform on the soundtrack. Reception =Box office= Gladiator grossed $187.7 million in the United States and Canada and $269.9 million in other territories for a total of $457.6 million, against a production budget of $103 million. In North America, the film earned $34.8 million in its opening weekend at 2,938 theaters, topping the box office.Schwartz, p.141 It remained number one in its second weekend grossing $24.6 million, and dropped to third place in its third weekend with $19.7 million behind newcomers Dinosaur, Mission: Impossible 2 and Shanghai Noon. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 77% based on 197 reviews, with an average rating of 7.26/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Ridley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladiatorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 67 out of 100, based on 46 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. The Battle of Germania was cited by CNN as one of their \\"favorite on-screen battle scenes\\", while Entertainment Weekly named Maximus as their sixth favorite action hero, because of \\"Crowe's steely, soulful performance\\", and named it as their third favorite revenge film. In December 2000, Gladiator was named the best film of the year by viewers of Film 2000, taking 40% of the votes. In 2002, a Channel 4 (UK TV) poll named it as the sixth greatest film of all time. Entertainment Weekly put it on its end-of-the-decade, \\"best-of\\" list, saying, \\"Are you not entertained?\\".Geier, Thom; Jensen, Jeff; Jordan, Tina; Lyons, Margaret; Markovitz, Adam; Nashawaty, Chris; Pastorek, Whitney; Rice, Lynette; Rottenberg, Josh; Schwartz, Missy; Slezak, Michael; Snierson, Dan; Stack, Tim; Stroup, Kate; Tucker, Ken; Vary, Adam B.; Vozick-Levinson, Simon; Ward, Kate (December 11, 2009), \\"The 100 Greatest Movies, TV shows, Albums, Books, Characters, Scenes, Episodes, Songs, Dresses, Music vidos, and Trends that entertained us over the past\\". Entertainment Weekly. (1079/1080):74‚Äì84 Michael Wilmington of The Chicago Tribune gave praise to Scott's direction, comparing the visual style of the film to that of Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner. Conversely, Roger Ebert gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, criticizing the look of the film as \\"muddy, fuzzy, and indistinct.\\" He also derided the writing, saying it \\"employs depression as a substitute for personality, and believes that if characters are bitter and morose enough, we won't notice how dull they are.\\" Camille Paglia called the film \\"boring, badly shot and suffused with sentimental p.c. rubbish.\\" =Accolades= Gladiator was nominated in 36 individual ceremonies, including the 73rd Academy Awards, the BAFTA Awards, and the Golden Globe Awards. Of 119 award nominations, the film won 48 prizes. The film won five Academy Awards and was nominated for an additional seven, including Best Original Screenplay, Best Supporting Actor for Joaquin Phoenix and Best Director for Ridley Scott. It was the first movie to win Best Picture without winning either a directing or screenwriting award since All the King's Men at the 22nd Academy Awards in 1950. In 2003, Chicago became another Best Picture winner which didn't win an Academy Award in either of these two major categories. Due to Academy rules, only Hans Zimmer was officially nominated for Best Original Score, and not Lisa Gerrard at the time. However, the pair did win the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score as co-composers. Impact The film's mainstream success is responsible for an increased interest in Roman and classical history in the United States. According to The New York Times, this has been dubbed the \\"Gladiator Effect\\". The Cicero biography Cicero: The Life and Times of Rome's Greatest Politician and Gregory Hays's translation of Marcus Aurelius's Meditations received large spikes in sales after the release of the film. The film also began a revival of the historical epic genre with films such as The Last Samurai, Troy, The Alamo, King Arthur, Alexander, 300, Kingdom of Heaven, and Robin Hood (the last two were also directed by Scott). The gladiator arena set piece from the 2002 film Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, which entered production shortly after the release of Gladiator, has been compared to the arena setting in the Scott film. The character of Maximus was placed 12th in the Total Film list of 50 best movie heroes and villains and 35th in the Empire's 100 Greatest Movie Characters.The 100 Greatest Movie Characters Empire Maximus is also featured on 55c \\"Australian Legends\\" postage stamp series. Russell Crowe attended a ceremony to mark the creation of the stamps. Home media The film was first released on DVD on November 21, 2000, and has since been released in several different extended and special edition versions. Special features for the Blu-ray Disc and DVDs include deleted scenes, trailers, documentaries, commentaries, storyboards, image galleries, Easter eggs, and cast auditions. The film was released on Blu-ray in September 2009, in a 2-disc edition containing both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, as part of Paramount's \\"Sapphire Series\\" (Paramount acquired the rights to the film when it bought the DreamWorks library in 2006). Initial reviews of the Blu-ray Disc release criticized poor image quality, leading many to call for it to be remastered, as Sony did with The Fifth Element in 2007. A remastered version was later released in 2010. The DVD editions that have been released since the original two-disc version, include a film only single-disc edition as well as a three-disc \\"extended edition\\" DVD which was released in August 2005. The extended edition DVD features approximately fifteen minutes of additional scenes, most of which appear in the previous release as deleted scenes. The original cut, which Scott still calls his director's cut, is also select-able via seamless branching (which is not included on the UK edition). The DVD is also notable for having a new commentary track featuring director Scott and star Crowe. The film is on the first disc, the second one has a three-hour documentary into the making of the film by DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika, and the third disc contains supplements. Discs one and two of the three-disc extended edition were also repackaged and sold as a two-disc \\"special edition\\" in the EU in 2005. The film was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray by Paramount Home Media Distribution on May 15, 2018. Sequel In June 2001, Douglas Wick said a Gladiator prequel was in development. The following year, Wick, Walter Parkes, David Franzoni, and John Logan switched direction to a sequel set fifteen years later; the Praetorian Guards rule Rome and an older Lucius is trying to learn who his real father was. However, Russell Crowe was interested in resurrecting Maximus, and further researched Roman beliefs about the afterlife to accomplish this. Ridley Scott expressed interest, although he admitted the project would have to be retitled as it had little to do with gladiators. An easter egg contained on disc 2 of the extended edition/special edition DVD releases includes a discussion of possible scenarios for a follow-up. This includes a suggestion by Parkes that, in order to enable Russell Crowe to return to play Maximus, a sequel could involve a \\"multi-generational drama about Maximus and the Aurelians and this chapter of Rome\\", similar in concept to The Godfather Part II. In 2006, Scott stated he and Crowe approached Nick Cave to rewrite the film, but their ideas conflicted with DreamWorks's idea of a spin-off involving Lucius, whom Scott revealed would turn out to be Maximus's son with Lucilla. Scott noted that a tale of corruption in Rome was too complex, whereas Gladiator worked due to its simple drive. In 2009, details of Cave's ultimately-rejected script, titled Christ Killer, surfaced on the internet, which Cave described as a \\"deities vs. deity vs. humankind\\" story. The script would have opened with a group of dying Roman gods reincarnating Maximus, who returns to Rome to defend his son Marius and his Christian companions against the Decian persecution. The film would have concluded with Maximus defeating Roman legionaries led by an adult Lucius and becoming an immortal force of war, with a 20-minute sequence of Maximus fighting in the Crusades, World War II, and the Vietnam War before ending up working at the modern-day Pentagon. In March 2017, Scott again stated that he has an idea of how a sequel could be done, and that he is currently trying to convince Russell Crowe to reprise his role as Maximus. By November 2018, it was announced that Paramount Pictures is developing a sequel, which Universal has the option to co-finance, with Scott returning as director and Peter Craig writing the script. In June 2019, Parkes and MacDonald confirmed that the sequel was still in development with Scott and Craig, saying, \\"We're working with Ridley Scott, that's one we wouldn't touch unless we felt in a way to do it was legitimate. We're working with an amazing writer as well, Peter Craig. It picks up the story 30 years later... 25 years later.\\" The plot is expected to center on the story of Lucius.

They are colloquially called \\"clown doctors\\" which is a trademarked name in several countries. These visits to hospitals have been shown to help in lifting patients' moods with the positive power of hope and humor. There is also an associated positive benefit to the staff and families of patients.Battrick, Cath; Glasper, Edward Alan; Prudhoe, Gill and Weaver, Katy. 2007. ‚ÄúClown Humour: The Perceptions of Doctors, Nurses, Parents and Children.‚Äù Journal of Children's and Young People's Nursing 1(4): 174-179. Background Patch Adams, considered the first hospital clown, started being a hospital clown in the 1970s. He was portrayed in the movie Patch Adams by Robin Williams, bringing attention to hospital clowning. Professional Clown Doctors began working in hospitals in 1986 under a program called the Big Apple Circus Clown Care Unit, which was started by Michael Christensen in New York City. Clown Doctor programs now operate in every state in Australia, New Zealand,Mora, Jim. July 14, 2009. \\"Clown Doctors.\\" Radio New Zealand National interview the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, South Africa, Hong Kong, Brazil, Belarus ,Taiwan and all over Europe and in some parts of India. Clown Doctors attend specifically to the psycho-social needs of the hospitalized child but in some hospitals they also visit adults.Nuttman-Shwartz, Orit; Scheyer, Rachel and Tzioni, Herzl. 2010. ‚ÄúMedical Clowning: Even Adults Deserve a Dream.‚Äù Social Work in Health Care 49: 581‚Äì598. They parody the hospital routine to help children adapt to their surroundings, they also distract from and demystify painful or frightening procedures. The atmosphere of fun and laughter can help children forget about the illness and the stress for a moment. Clown Doctors use techniques such as magic, music, storytelling and other clowning skills to empower children with doses of fun that help them deal with the range of emotions they may experience while in hospital: fear, anxiety, loneliness, boredom. The healing power of humor and laughter combats stress, reduces pain by releasing endorphin (the body's natural painkiller), boosts the immune system by increasing the level of T cells & lowering serum cortisol levels, helps promote a positive outlook, helps people to cope with difficult situations and helps to create bonds and therefore support between people, all of which aids the healing process. According to Tan, Mets√§l√§, and Hannula, \\"Clown care creates a positive emotional state, promotes interaction between parents and child, and fosters affirmative environmental conditions.\\" Research on the physiological health benefits on laughter has been conducted for decades and continues to be carried out by medical physicians internationally. There is also a growing group of researchers that are exploring the psychological benefits of laughter, and specifically the work of Clown- Doctors.Nicklaus Childrens, Big Apple Circus Clown Care¬Æ Celebrates 15 Years of Bringing Smiles to Hospitalized Children at Nicklaus Children‚Äôs HospitalClown as interpreters of emotions, by Alberto Dionigi P.A.T.

In the 1926 elections, he was elected to the Central Legislative Assembly as a Swaraj Party candidate from Oudh. He became the Chief Whip of the Swaraj Party in the Assembly. Kidwai's political acumen helped maintain a unity in the party on controversial issues. In 1929, Kidwai was elected the Secretary of the Swaraj Party in the Assembly. He had utmost loyalty towards Moti Lal Nehru. The Indian National Congress made a demand of Purna Swaraj on 19 December 1929 and Mahatma Gandhi launched the Civil Disobedience Movement in January 1930. In January 1940, Kidwai resigned from the Central Legislative Assembly in response to the Purna Swaraj resolution by the Congress Working Committee and plunged into the Civil Disobedience Movement. After the passage of the Government of India Act 1935, he held an office for the Indian National Congress. In 1937, Kidwai became a minister for Revenue and Prisons in Govind Ballabh Pant's cabinet in the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh (UP) under the Provincial Autonomy Scheme. Under his stewardship, UP became the first province to curtail the zamindari system. In April 1946, he became the Home Minister of UP. Politics (post-independence) Kidwai was a major ally of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. After India gained independence from the British Raj in 1947, Kidwai became India's first Minister for Communications. (Kidwai and Abul Kalam Azad were the two Muslims in Nehru's central cabinet.) After the first general elections in 1952, Mr.Kidwai elected from Bahraich. Nehru entrusted Kidwai with the portfolio of Food and Agriculture at a time when there was food rationing in the country. Death Kidwai died in Delhi on 24 October 1954. He had heart failure after experiencing an attack of asthma while delivering a speech. His burial site, at his home village, was covered by a Mughal-style mausoleum. According to historian Paul Brass, \\"A formidable fund-raiser for Congress movements and elections, he distributed his largesse to all and sundry, but died in debt, leaving behind only a decaying house in his home village.\\" Legacy The Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Award was created in 1956 by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) in 1956 to recognize Indian researchers in the agricultural field. Awards are distributed every second year, and take the form of medals, citations, and cash prizes.

Early service Born in Bellingham, Washington, Fairchild moved to Olympia in 1905 when his father was appointed by Governor Meade as chairman of Washington's first Railroad Commission. Muir graduated from Olympia High School (officially William Winlock Miller High School) in 1913, then entered the U.S. Army's Signal Corps in 1913 in an Army Signal Corps reserve unit in Seattle, while he was a student at the University of Washington. In 1916, he was deployed in the Washington National Guard with the rank of sergeant, and his unit joined in the search for Pancho Villa along the Mexican border, where he spent much time in a horse saddle in the desert heat. Watching observation planes flying overhead in the United States' first armed conflict using airplanes, Fairchild was an easy recruit when flyboys were being sought to fight with the French and Italians in the developing war in Europe, before the U.S. entered World War I. A year later Fairchild became a flying cadet at Berkeley, California, getting his wings and commission in the U.S. Army's Aviation Section in January 1918. Fairchild fought the Germans from the air over the Rhine, including night bombing missions, in an era when bombs were still being released from the hand grasp of the bombardier. Between the wars In December 1918 Fairchild returned home and served at McCook Field, Ohio; Mitchel Field, New York, and Langley Field, Virginia. On October 20, 1922This day in aviation he was practicing dog fighting with Lt. Harold Ross Harris; when Harris plane went out of control and Harris was forced to parachute his way to safetyEvening star. [volume, June 02, 1929, Image 93 accessed January 11,2019 incorrectly gives date as August 22]; ironically nearly a year later August 22, 1923 both Harris and Fairchild piloted the US Military first heavy bomber the Witteman-Lewis XNBL-1. In 1926 and 1927, he flew to South America as part of the Pan American Good Will Flight a pioneering flight that sought to promote air postal service, U.S. commercial aviation and take messages of friendship to the governments and people of Central and South America, while forging aerial navigation routes through the Americas. The flight originated with five aircraft and crews taking off from Kelly Field, Texas on December 21, 1926, seeking to land in 23 Central and South American countries. The aircraft used for the journey were new observation planes, the Loening OA-1A that could be used as both landplanes and seaplanes, with Liberty engines and a wood interior structure with an aluminum-covered fuselage and fabric-covered wings. Each plane was named for a U.S. city and crewed by two pilots, one of whom was an engineering officer, since there were very few airfields or repair facilities along the route, with the crew choosing the motto \\"No Work, No Ride.\\" Crew of the New York: Maj. Herbert Dargue, Lt. Ennis Whitehead; Crew of the San Antonio: Capt. Arthur McDaniel, Lt. Charles Robinson; Crew of the San Francisco: Capt. Ira Eaker, Lt. Muir Fairchild; Crew of the Detroit: Capt. Clinton F. Woolsey, Lt. John Benton; Crew of the St. Louis: Lt. Bernard Thompson, Lt. Leonard Weddington The flight was marred by tragedy when the Detroit and New York accidentally collided mid-air and got locked together. The crew of the New York were able to parachute to safety but Capt. Woolsley and Lt. Benton were killed when the Detroit hit the ground. The Pan American Flyers were greeted by a cheering crowd including President Calvin Coolidge, Cabinet members, and diplomats from Central and Latin America when they returned to Bolling Field, Washington, D.C., on May 2, 1927. Fairchild and the rest of the surviving Pan American Flight crew, and Charles Lindbergh, were among the first nine aviators to receive the newly created award Distinguished Flying Cross. The Pan Am Good Will Tour aviators were the first to be named to receive the Distinguished Flying Cross, Lindbergh's being named came after the Pan Am Good Will Tour members, though Lindbergh actually received his medal first. Fairchild went on to complete the course in the Air Corps Engineer School at Wright Field in June 1929 and went to Santa Monica, California, as Air Corps representative to Douglas Aircraft Corporation. In June 1935 he graduated from the Air Corps Tactical School, along with strategic bombing advocates Haywood S. Hansell, Barney Giles, Vernon M. Guymon, Laurence S. Kuter, Lawson H. M. Sanderson and Hoyt S. Vandenberg, then became an Air Corps Tactical School instructor. He later attended the Army Industrial College, and the Army War College. He rose to director of air tactics and strategy in 1939. Second World War Dwight Eisenhower, Army Chief of Staff; Maj Gen Muir Fairchild, AU commander; and Maj Gen David Schlatter, the AU deputy commanding general (education), review an AU organizational chart during General Eisenhower's visit to Maxwell on 9 April 1947. In 1940, Fairchild went to the Plans Division in Washington and in 1941 was named secretary of the newly formed Air Staff. Two months later he was advanced two grades to brigadier general and named assistant chief of Air Corps. In 1942 he became director of military requirements and was promoted to major general in August. In November he became a member of the Joint Strategic Survey Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Post war In January 1946, he was named commandant of Air University at Maxwell Field in Alabama, with promotion to lieutenant general. On May 27, 1948 he became the second vice chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, with the rank of general. General Fairchild died of a heart attack at his quarters at Fort Myer on March 17, 1950, while still on active duty as vice chief of staff at the Pentagon. He was survived by his wife, Florence Alice Fairchild, and his daughter, Betsy Anne Calvert. Legacy Fairchild Hall, the main academic building at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado, and the library at the Air University in Alabama, Fairchild Memorial Hall, were named for him.

He was a co-founder of pop rock group Sherbet, which had commercial success in the 1970s including their number-one single, \\"Summer Love\\" in 1975. The majority of Sherbet's original songs were co-written by Shakespeare with fellow band member Garth Porter. Other Sherbet singles co-written by Shakespeare include \\"Cassandra\\" (peaked at number nine in 1973), \\"Slipstream\\" and \\"Silvery Moon\\" (both reached number five in 1974). In January 1976 Shakespeare left the band citing dissatisfaction with touring, pressures of writing and concerns over the group's finances. Shakespeare has produced albums for other artists including Post by Paul Kelly in 1985. Biography Clive Richard Shakespeare was born in Southampton, Hampshire, England on 3 June 1947. With his family he migrated to Australia and settled in Sydney. As lead guitarist, he joined various bands including The Road Agents in 1968 in Sydney with Terry Hyland on vocals. He was a founding member of Down Town Roll, which was a Motown covers band, alongside Adrian Cuff (organ), Frank Ma (vocals), Doug Rea (bass guitar), Pam Slater (vocals) and Danny Taylor on drums. In April 1969 Rea, Shakespeare and Taylor founded pop, rock band, Sherbet with Dennis Laughlin on vocals (ex- Sebastian Hardie Blues Band, Clapham Junction) and Sammy See on organ, guitar, and vocals (Clapham Junction). See had left in October 1970 to join The Flying Circus and was replaced by New Zealand-born Garth Porter (Samael Lilith, Toby Jugg) who provided Hammond organ and electric piano. Sherbet's initial singles were cover versions released by Infinity Records and distributed by Festival Records. From 1972 to 1976, Sherbet's chief songwriting team of Porter and Shakespeare were responsible for co-writing the lion's share of the band's material, which combined British pop and American soul influences. For their debut album, Time Change... A Natural Progression (December 1972), Shakespeare co-wrote five tracks including the top 30 single, \\"You've Got the Gun\\". Other Sherbet singles co-written by Shakespeare include \\"Cassandra\\" (peaked at number nine in 1973), \\"Slipstream\\" and \\"Silvery Moon\\" (both reached number five in 1974), and their number-one hit \\"Summer Love\\" from 1975. Sherbet followed with more top five singles, \\"Life\\" and \\"Only One You\\" / \\"Matter of Time\\". In January 1976, Shakespeare left Sherbet citing 'personal reasons'. He later explained \\"I couldn't even go out the front of my house because there were all these girls just hanging on the fence [...] There was always a deadline for Garth and me - another album, another tour. When it did finally end, I was relieved more than anything because I had had enough. I left the band early in 1976 for reasons I don't want to discuss fully ‚Ä¶ but let's just say I wasn't happy about where all the money went\\". The last single he played on was \\"Child's Play\\", which was a No. 5 hit in February. Shakespeare was soon replaced by Harvey James (ex-Mississippi, Ariel). In 1977, Shakespeare issued a solo single, \\"I Realize\\" / \\"There's a Way\\" on Infinity Records. Shakespeare set up Silverwood Studios and worked in record production, including co- producing Paul Kelly's debut solo album, Post (1985). Shakespeare rejoined Sherbet for reunion concerts including the Countdown Spectacular tour throughout Australia during September and October 2006. That year also saw the release of two newly recorded tracks on the compilation album, Sherbet ‚Äì Super Hits, \\"Red Dress\\" which was written by Porter, Shakespeare, Daryl Braithwaite, James, Tony Mitchell, and Alan Sandow; and \\"Hearts Are Insane\\" written by Porter.

Publishing history Robot Archie appeared in Lion Issue #1 in February 1952; it was published by IPC Magazines -- at the time, the biggest publisher of weekly adventure comics in the UK, along with DC Thomson. Lion was a science fiction action-adventure title in the mold of Eagle, and was a direct competitor to it. Archie began his career in Lion with the moniker The Jungle Robot. The character was created by writer E. George Cowan and artist Ted Kearon. The strip lasted 25 weeks before it took a five-year hiatus and returned in 1957 as Archie, The Robot Explorer, eventually becoming better known as Robot Archie. The strip was one of Lion's most popular during the '60s, but the character's adventures ended when Lion was finally cancelled in May '74. The series was published in France and the Netherlands, and was popular there. In the Netherlands, beginning in 1971, Robot Archie appeared in the comics magazine Sjors, for which Bert Bus drew new Archie material (which was translated into French, as well), and two or three series of albums, which -- like the Archie publication in France -- were halted in the early '80s.Robot Archie strips appeared in colour (with re-drawn art from the Dutch series) in Vulcan, a short-lived weekly title which lasted until 1976. After that, Robot Archie entered publishing limbo but remained well-loved by fans. He made a brief cameo showing under the name \\"Android Andy\\" in Alan Moore and Alan Davis's run on Captain Britain for Marvel UK. Subsequently, Archie emerged in the pages of Grant Morrison's Zenith strip in 2000 AD. There, he was portrayed as a burned-out acid casualty calling himself \\"Acid Archie\\". In 2004, a new \\"Classic Archie\\" adventure by Bert Bus was published in Dutch. In 2005, it was announced that Robot Archie, as well as all of IPC's adventure heroes, would appear in a new six-issue mini-series, to be published by the Wildstorm imprint of DC Comics. Called Albion, the series was plotted by Alan Moore, and written by Leah Moore and John Reppion, with art by Shane Oakley and George Freeman. Robot Archie is featured on the cover of the first issue, which was drawn by Dave Gibbons. Fictional character biography Robot Archie was built by Professor C.R. Ritchie to be the world's most powerful mechanical man. Originally, he was dubbed \\"The Jungle Robot\\" (due to his early adventures taking place in the jungles of Africa and South America), and was controlled remotely by Professor Ritchie, along with nephew Ted Ritchie and Ken Dale, his best friend. Robot Archie's adventures started off as conventional action-thrillers, with Archie and his friends battling criminals and jungle creatures, but over time, he began to fight more fantastic and dangerous villains and aliens, including The Sludge, a monster that had previously had its own strip in Lion. Initially, Archie could not speak, but around 1966, he gained a voice box, revealing a boastful, yet charming, personality. When Robot Archie re-appeared in the pages of Grant Morrison's Zenith as \\"Acid Archie\\", he was part of a team of heroes called \\"Black Flag\\"; there, he helped Zenith fight the evil, supernatural race known as the Lloigor. Archie was apparently destroyed by Ruby Fox, a.k.a. \\"Voltage\\", in Phase IV, when she short-circuited him whilst he was trying to rip off her head. But later, that was revealed to have been a copy of Archie within the Chimera pocket universe, as he is seen partying with Zenith and Peter St. John, a.k.a. \\"Mandala\\" during the Epilogue. Archie also surfaced in zzzenith.com, in the special Prog 2001 edition of 2000AD, where Zenith explained that rust in the brain-pan had caused Archie's personality to switch from anarchist Acid-House aficionado, to vigilante, hunting down sex-offenders with a lethal vigour. He was last seen in the story wearing a false beard, as he escaped on a bus after sexually assaulting popstar Britney Spears. Robot Archie's swan song was in Albion, where he was found in the basement of a Manchester pub by Penny Dolmann, who repaired and modified him in order to rescue her father. He was being held in an isolated prison where men and women, some innocent, were sent simply for the 'crime' of being different. Archie killed many guards and was destroyed whilst acting as a decoy for Penny. \\"Albion\\" #1-6 (Aug. 2005 ‚Äì Nov. 2006) See also *Albion *Lion *Zenith References External links *Robot Archie at International Superhero *History of Lion at comicsuk Category:British comic strips Category:Drama comics Category:Science fiction comics Category:1952 comics debuts Category:Comics characters introduced in 1952 Category:2006 comics endings Category:British comics characters Category:Wildstorm Publications superheroes Category:Fleetway and IPC Comics Category:Fictional humanoid robots Category:Male characters in comics ","title":"Robot Archie"},{"id":"3616865","text":"Bob Rich is an American cartoonist.

The Black Boys, so- called because they sometimes blackened their faces during their actions, were upset with British policy regarding American Indians following Pontiac's War. When that war came to an end in 1765, the Pennsylvania government began to reopen trade with the Native Americans who had taken part in the uprising. Many settlers of the Conococheague Valley were outraged, having suffered greatly from Indian raids during the war. The 1764 Enoch Brown School Massacre, in which ten school children had been killed and scalped, was the most notorious example of these raids. Led by James \\"Black Boy Jimmy\\" Smith, the Black Boys‚Äîfaces blackened and dressed as Indians‚Äîconfiscated and destroyed a number of supply wagons that were headed to Fort Pitt on March 6, 1765. Some of the items in the supply wagons were official diplomatic presents, necessary for making peace with Native Americans at Fort Pitt. Other items, however, were trade goods sent by Indian trader George Croghan, who was seeking to recoup his losses from the French and Indian War. Croghan had secretly (and illegally) included rum and gunpowder in the shipments in order to make a profit once trade with the Indians was legally resumed. Despite the fact that the shipment contained illegal trade goods, British army officers at nearby Fort Loudoun sided with Croghan and the traders. Using American Indian raiding tactics, the Black Boys continued to prevent shipments from moving through the valley, and Fort Loudoun was surrounded and fired upon on several occasions. Tensions dissipated after formal peace in Pontiac's War had been established, but in 1769, when another war with Native Americans seemed imminent, Black Boys again stopped another wagon train. After British troops arrested several of the Black Boys and imprisoned them in Fort Bedford, James Smith and the Black Boys surprised and captured the fort on September 12, 1769. No one was harmed, and the prisoners were set free. (This capture of Fort Bedford is documented only in Smith's autobiography, so it may be a tall tale, although historian Gregory Evans Dowd notes that there is some corroborating evidence, and some other historians believe the tale to be true.) Troops were sent to arrest Smith, and in a struggle a friend of Smith was shot and killed. Smith was arrested and charged with manslaughter, but was acquitted, as there were doubts that it was his weapon that had killed the man. The Black Boys were similar to the earlier Paxton Boys in their hostility to the British Crown and the colonial government, but the Black Boys did not target Native Americans in their actions. According to historian Gregory Evans Dowd, a number of historians have confused the two movements. The Black Boys Rebellion has generally been forgotten, overshadowed in American historiography by the 1765 Stamp Act crisis. Nevertheless, some historians see the Black Boys Rebellion as a precursor to the American Revolution. A fictionalized version of the Black Boys Rebellion was depicted in the 1939 Hollywood film Allegheny Uprising, starring John Wayne as James Smith. The film was based on the 1937 boys' history The First Rebel: Being a lost chapter of our history and a true narrative of America's first uprising against English military authority, by Neil H. Swanson. References *Dixon, David. Never Come to Peace Again: Pontiac's Uprising and the Fate of the British Empire in North America.

Formed in 1996, their music is reminiscent of British indie bands. History After playing in a short lived grunge cover band together in their teens, Adrian Da Silva and Don Cruz regrouped in the summer of 1996 to write Brit/indie-rock style music, a relatively new musical direction for them. After recording a demo and recruiting bassist Wade Bolingbroke and drummer Alex Lee, 'Cry' (later renamed Audiotraffic) was signed to Wings Music Entertainment. In 1998, Cry's first album was recorded and produced by Benjamin LeFevre, a music veteran who has worked with the likes of Pet Shop Boys, The Rolling Stones and Van Halen. Adrian and Don travelled to London to do a final mixing of their CD, spending just 11 days on recording and post production. Wade and Alex left the band due to personal reasons and were replaced by Woo Joo Lee and Masaki Heung respectively. The band has since spent the last few years playing at various venues and events, appearing on television, film, radio, online and in print. One of the highlights of their career has been opening and supporting the British rock group Mansun on their 1999 tour of Hong Kong. The band was particularly grateful for the personal praise and encouragement that they received from Mansun following their performance. They have also opened for Rialto, Swedish group Prime STH, and Brett Anderson and Bernard Butler‚Äôs band The Tears. Now independent from Wings Music Entertainment and as of 2003 renamed 'Audiotraffic', the band continued on their path to bring their music to a larger audience. Audiotraffic actively contributed to the Hong Kong entertainments scene having co-written and performed on the soundtrack for the 2003 Eason Chan and Louis Koo film 'Naked Ambition', and appeared in Jackie Chan's 2004 film 'New Police Story'. They have been a popular act at the Hong Kong Rockit music festival in 2003 and 2004, sharing the main stage with artists such as The 5.6.7.8's (the band from the Tarantino film Kill Bill: Vol. 1), Aqualung, Electric Eel Shock, and The Cooper Temple Clause. In 2005 they were relegated to the Marquee Stage at the festival to make way for other local bands. In 2004, Audiotraffic were the winners of the Hong Kong region in the World Battle of the Bands competition . As regional finalists they qualified to represent Hong Kong at the World final held in Auckland, New Zealand, where they competed with other finalists from the Asia Pacific region. Audiotraffic lost out to the local Kiwi finalists, but received an honorable mention from the judges. Whilst in New Zealand, Audiotraffic toured the country for two weeks with the other finalists making several TV appearances and radio broadcasts. Trivia * Before signing to Wings Music Entertainment in 1998, the band rejected a chance to sign to PolyGram Records due to artistic differences with their proposed producer. * Audiotraffic's members hail from all over East and Southeast Asia - Adrian is from Hong Kong, Don from Malaysia, Woo Joo is from South Korea, Masaki from Hong Kong, and Glenn and Ferdie from the Philippines. * Adrian was a VJ on Channel [V] International from 1999 to 2002. Audiotraffic (at the time still named Cry) performed on the final episode of Channel [V]'s 'Top 5 at 5' in the summer of 2002.

According to contemporary sources, she was a good and faithful wife, in spite of her husband's infidelity; and, forewarned of the attempt on his life, she endeavoured in vain to prevent his murder.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. I, p. 582 (\\"Calpurnia\\", No. 2). Biography =Background= Born 76 BC, Calpurnia was the daughter of Lucius Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus, consul in 58 BC. Her brother was Lucius Calpurnius Piso, who would become consul in 15 BC.Caesar's Gallic War, Book 1, Julius Caesar, Hinds & Noble, 1898, pg. 83. =Marriage= Calpurnia married Julius Caesar late in 59 BC, during the latter's consulship.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 19, 21.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 13, 14; \\"The Life of Pompeius\\", 47. She was about seventeen years old, and was likely younger than her stepdaughter, Julia. About this time, Julia married Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus, a former prot√©g√© of Sulla, who had been consul in 70 BC, and recently become one of Caesar's closest political allies. Prior to their marriage, Caesar had been married either two or three times. In his childhood, Caesar had been betrothed to Cossutia, the daughter of a wealthy eques,Plutarch, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 5.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 1. although there is some uncertainty as to whether they were ever formally married. According to Suetonius, he was obliged to break off their engagement when, at the age of sixteen, he was nominated Flamen Dialis, a high-ranking priestly office whose holders had to be married by confarreatio, an ancient and solemn form of marriage that was open only to patricians. Caesar then married Cornelia, a woman of patrician rank and the daughter of Lucius Cornelius Cinna, at that time the most powerful man in Rome. By all accounts, their marriage was a happy one, and the product of their union was Julia, Caesar's only legitimate child. Following the downfall and death of Cinna and the ruin of his faction, the dictator Sulla commanded Caesar to divorce his rival's daughter, a demand that Caesar refused at great personal risk, for it nearly cost him his life.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 1, 5.Velleius Paterculus, Roman History, ii. 41. Cornelia died in 69 or 68 BC, as her husband was preparing to set out for Spain. On his return, Caesar married Pompeia, a granddaughter of Sulla. Their marriage ended in scandal. In 63 BC, Caesar had been elected Pontifex Maximus, receiving as his official residence a house on the Via Sacra. Here the sacred rites of the Bona Dea, from which all men were excluded, were celebrated in the winter of 62. But an ambitious young nobleman named Publius Claudius Pulcher entered the house disguised as a woman, ostensibly for the purpose of seducing Pompeia. His subsequent discovery shocked the Roman aristocracy, and rumours swirled about Pompeia's fidelity.Appian, \\"Bellum Civile\\", ii. 14. Caesar felt that he had no choice but to divorce Pompeia, not because he personally believed the rumours, but because the wife of the Pontifex Maximus had to be above suspicion.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 9, 10.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 6.Cassius Dio, Roman History, xxxvii. 45. Caesar then married Calpurnia. Her contemporaries describe Calpurnia as a humble, often shy woman.Carcopino, Cicero: The Secrets of his Correspondence, Vol. 1, pg. 352. By all accounts Calpurnia was a faithful and virtuous wife, and seems to have tolerated Caesar's affairs: he was rumored to have seduced the wives of a number of prominent men, including both of his allies in the First Triumvirate;Suetonius, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 50. and he had for some time been intimate with Servilia, a relationship that was an open secret at Rome. It was rumoured that Caesar was the father of Servilia's son, Marcus Junius Brutus,Plutarch, \\"The Life of Brutus\\", 5. although this is improbable on chronological grounds,Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, pp. 792, 793 (\\"Servilia\\", No. 2). and that Servilia attempted to interest Caesar in her daughter, Junia Tertia‚Äîwho according to other rumours, was also Caesar's daughter. Caesar also carried on affairs with the Mauretanian queen, Euno√´, and most famously with Cleopatra, the Queen of Egypt, who claimed that he was the father of her son, Ptolemy XV, better known as \\"Caesarion\\".Suetonius, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 52.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 49. No children resulted from Calpurnia's marriage to Caesar. According to the Roman historians, Caesar's murder was foretold by a number of ill omens, as well as the Etruscan haruspex Spurinna, who warned him of great personal danger either on or by the Ides of March in 44 BC.Suetonius, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 81.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 63.Cassius Dio, Roman History, xliv. 17. The night before his assassination, Calpurnia dreamed that Caesar had been stabbed, and lay dying in her arms. In the morning, she begged him not to meet the senate, as he had planned, and moved by her distress and entreaties, he resolved not to go.Appian, Bellum Civile, ii. 115.Velleius Paterculus, Roman History, ii. 57. But Decimus Junius Brutus, one of Caesar's closest friends, whom he had recently appointed Praetor Peregrinus, and secretly one of the conspirators against him, came to the house and persuaded Caesar to ignore the omens, and go to the senate.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Caesar\\", 64.Cassius Dio, Roman History, xliv. 18. Following her husband's assassination, Calpurnia delivered all of Caesar's personal papers, including his will and notes, along with his most precious possessions, to the consul Marcus Antonius, one of Caesar's most trusted allies, who had not been involved in the conspiracy.Plutarch, \\"The Life of Antonius\\", 15. She never remarried. Cultural depictions Greer Garson as Calpurnia. *In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Calpurnia has a dream that a statue of Caesar was flowing with blood as many Romans wash their hands in the blood. She also sees in her dream that Julius Caesar would die in her arms. *Calpurnia was portrayed by Gertrude Michael in Cleopatra (1934), Greer Garson in the 1953 adaptation of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, Gwen Watford in Cleopatra (1963), Joan Sims in Carry On Cleo (1964), Jill Bennett in the 1970 adaptation of Julius Caesar and Valeria Golino in the 2002 miniseries Julius Caesar. *Calpurnia was shown solving a murder in Mist of Prophecies (2002) - part of the Roma Sub Rosa series by Steven Saylor.

The concept of using measures of a candidate's moral and leadership attributes as well as physical and mental qualifications for selection was introduced in 1956, for the first time at any service academy. Also in 1956, as another service academy first, General McDermott introduced a comprehensive curriculum enrichment program designed to provide each cadet with a challenge to advance academically as far and as fast as possible, in accordance with the cadet's aptitudes, interests and prior preparation. General McDermott laid the groundwork for the establishment of an Astronautical Research Laboratory and an extension of the enrichment program to include graduate education opportunities for exceptional cadets. He was credited with introducing about 30 academic majors to the Academy and bringing a degree of flexibility to curriculum requirements.Adam Bernstein, \\"Robert McDermott; Air Force Academy Dean\\", Washington Post, obituary, August 29, 2006.

Among many TV appearances O'Malley is known for his portrayal of Patrick Harper in the long-running [1993-2009] Sharpe TV series with Sean Bean. O'Malley first appeared in roles in the films The Long Good Friday and Withnail and I, leading guest roles in many UK television series including Tales of the Unexpected, Waking The Dead, Wire in the Blood, Silent Witness and Vera, and roles in Longitude, Cleopatra for ABC and The Magnificent Seven for CBS and in the US TV film Vendetta, as well as Camelot and Shaughnessy: The Iron Marshal. O'Malley also played Irish explorer Tom Crean in the epic Central 8 part television series The Last Place on Earth with Hugh Grant and Martin Shaw and Max Von Sydow. In 2011 O'Malley turned his focus back to the stage and appeared in a slew of stage productions in the US and in the UK in quick succession. In the UK O'Malley appeared as Father Jack in a revival of Dancing at Lughnasa, which was nominated for an MTA Best Production Award, and followed that by playing John Rainey in a London revival of Irvine's Mixed Marriage, which received positive reviews. In 2014, O'Malley appeared as Big Daddy in a widely acclaimed production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at The Royal Exchange Theatre Manchester, for which he was nominated for an MTA Best Actor award. UK's The Stage selected O'Malley's performance in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof as one of the Top Five Performances in UK theatre in 2014. In 2018, it was announced that O'Malley would play the screen legend Marlon Brando in the one-man stage play Brando which is being developed by the Sundance Theatre Forum with The Brando Estate. Biography Daragh O'Malley was born in Holles Street Hospital in Dublin on 25 May 1954 to a politician, Donough, and a medical doctor Hilda (n√©e Moriarty). He was raised in Limerick and educated by the Jesuits at Crescent College and later by Carmelite monks at Terenure College in Dublin. On the day that O'Malley was born, his father, Donogh O'Malley, an engineer, was elected to D√°il √âireann for the first time. Donogh O'Malley served as a TD for Limerick East from 1954 to 1968 and as his country's Minister for Health and later Minister for Education. As Minister for Education Donogh O'Malley is credited with the upsurge in the Irish economy and the improvement of the quality of life in Ireland by introducing free education at secondary level. O'Malley's mother, Hilda Moriarty, was Patrick Kavanagh's inspiration for the poem Dark Miriam Ran Away, later put to the air of The Dawning of the Day and renamed Raglan Road at the request of the poet when he met the singer Luke Kelly of The Dubliners; it has been recorded by Van Morrison, Sinead O'Connor and Billy Joel. In 2019 this was voted Ireland's All Time Favourite Folk Song in a national TV poll. O'Malley's aunt Meave (his father's sister) is singer Dido's grandmother. Dido wrote Grafton Street in memory of her father, who was a nephew of Hilda Moriarty ‚Äì O‚ÄôMalley, the dark haired beauty that snared Patrick Kavanagh. The Irish Times said that as ‚Äòa young girl, Dido was obsessed with great-aunt Hilda, the tales of her beauty and her role in Raglan Road‚Äô, and that she sung Raglan Road to her father as he was dying. As a teenager, O'Malley appeared as the lead in several student productions at Terenure College Of the cast of one of the school plays, Juno and the Paycock, five of the cast went on to become professional actors. He won multiple All Ireland prizes for poetry recitation and public speaking - aged 14 he won The Galassi Cup, an all-aged national public speaking competition. O'Malley's subject was The Life of Padraig Pearse. O'Malley has seemingly been approached many times over the years by the Fianna F√°il party to put his name forward for election in his father's constituency, then Limerick East now Limerick City, but on each occasion O'Malley declined the invitation. On the Sam Smyth Radio Show in 2004, O'Malley stated, \\"The stress of politics, one of the great performance arts, killed my father at 47 ‚Äì while I would like nothing better than appearing in the great theatre that is D√°il √âireann [the Irish parliament] even for just one day, I feel the price one would pay is far too high. Politics I have discovered, really is a thankless business which ultimately ends in failure ‚Äì no matter how well intentioned one is.\\" O'Malley was very friendly with Irish actor Richard Harris, who was also from Limerick. O'Malley's father was once engaged to Harris's sister Audrey, but she died aged 21. O'Malley and Harris were often spotted together in hostelries around London and at rugby matches in Britain when the Munster team were playing - often with Peter O'Toole in tow - or in Kilkee in County Clare, Ireland and at Dingle Races in Kerry. O'Malley and Harris both had an interest in horse racing - Harris owned two racehorses - Cromwell and A Tramp Shining, and O'Malley owned two, Mustang Prince and Running Deer, a filly named after a character in Harris's film A Man Called Horse. O'Malley was one of the last people to take a meeting with former Taoiseach Charles Haughey. Haughey, who was O'Malley's father's best friend, requested a meeting with O'Malley in his final days. O'Malley spent an afternoon in June 2006 with a very ill Haughey at his home in Dublin, accompanied by Noel Pearson, producer of the film My Left Foot. O'Malley studied at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art, where he appeared as Creon in Antigone with US actress Amy Irving in his final year production. On leaving LAMDA O'Malley was a founding member of Common Stock Theatre Company, one of London's first community theatre groups, which was based in an old church on Pentonville Road in London ‚Äì where the great clown Grimaldi is buried - and which took theatre to the poor of London's East End. A fellow founder member of Common Stock was Dame Harriet Walter O'Malley married Gabrielle Leavy in June 1993 at Farm Street Church in London. From 1992 to 2009, O'Malley appeared with Sean Bean in the iconic ITV series Sharpe, filmed in Ukraine, Crimea, Portugal, Turkey, India and at various locations in the UK. Sharpe is considered to be one of the most successful British TV series ever made and having been digitalized is still seen in 120 countries around the world. It has been dubbed into many languages from Spanish to Hindi. Former British prime minister David Cameron's only job outside of politics was as PR for Sharpe when he worked as Director of Communications for Carlton Television who produced the series. After Bobby Ewing was killed off in Dallas, Patrick Duffy, who had played the part, and O'Malley formed a partnership in the film production company European Motion Pictures. In 1992 O'Malley sued Rupert Murdoch, Gill and McMillan/WH Allen and The Sunday Press for libel, over an article which appeared on the front page of the News of the World and was copied in subsequent publications, which linked O'Malley and Patrick Duffy with the IRA. The case was settled on the steps of Ireland's High Court, with Murdoch accepting \\"that there was no truth whatsoever in the News of The World article\\", resulting in Murdoch et al paying O'Malley a sum plus costs, which at the time was \\"the highest libel settlement in the history of the Irish State\\". In the mid-1990s, O'Malley was cast as Debra Winger's husband in the ill-fated feature Divine Rapture, which also starred Marlon Brando, John Hurt and Johnny Depp. The production collapsed a few weeks into filming when Orion, the major Los Angeles production company backing the film, suddenly went bankrupt. O'Malley lived in Los Angeles for many years and after the collapse of Divine Rapture remained close to Brando. O'Malley and Brando were working on a film version of The Merchant of Venice - with Brando due to play Shylock - when Brando died. On Brando's death the project went into turnaround and was subsequently picked up with Al Pacino as Shylock. O'Malley bowed out and was not involved in the production of the Pacino film. In 2011, O'Malley returned to the stage, appearing as Father Jack in a UK production of Brien Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa and as trade unionist John Rainey in an acclaimed London production of Irving's Mixed Marriage. Michael Billington of The Guardian described O'Malley's performance as \\"magnificent\\" in \\"the most compelling play in London\\". In late 2014, O'Malley appeared as Big Daddy in \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre. O'Malley was nominated as Best Actor at The MTA Theatre Awards - MTA stated \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof seethes with unhappy people circling the central character, patriarch Big Daddy. Daragh O‚ÄôMalley blisters his way through this famous role like a raging bull with great physical presence tempered by emotional vulnerability\\". The Times called O'Malley's performance as Big Daddy \\"towering in every sense of the word\\". In 2019 O'Malley appeared in a series of TV commercials for Allianz Insurance entitled We Cover Courage, playing his father, Donogh, in a high-end dramatisation of the announcement of the revolutionary free education scheme in Ireland in 1966. The Allianz commercials were directed by movie director Richie Smyth (The Siege of Jadotville). O'Malley is the voice of the iconic crooked lawyer Nick Virago in the multi-million-selling Lucas Arts CD-ROM Grim Fandango. Also a voice actor and voice-over artist, O'Malley was for many years the voice of the Utah-based Beneficial Life Insurance Company on commercial radio across North America. Awards O'Malley produced the Irish version of The Rocky Horror Show in Dublin; the show won numerous awards, including a Best Production Jacob's Award. Author Richard O'Brien described O'Malley's Irish production as \\"without doubt, the sexiest version of my show ever produced\\". In Los Angeles, O'Malley won a Drama-Logue Best Actor Award for his 1998 performance as Sweeney in Patrick Marber's Dealers Choice at The Mark Taper Forum. A one-off episode of the BBC Series Doctors, a two-handed episode in which O'Malley appeared with actor Christopher Timothy, won a BANFF TV Award. In 2011, a production of Dancing at Lughnasa in which O'Malley appeared as Father Jack was nominated for an MTA Award. In 2015, O'Malley was nominated for an MTA Award and STAGE Best Actor Award for his performance as Big Daddy in Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof at the Royal Exchange, Manchester. In 2017, O'Malley was nominated for a West End Offie Award for his performance as the crooked police chief Ivan in the UK premiere of Maxine Gorky's The Last Ones at The Jermyn Street Theatre. Charity work O'Malley was founder of The Sharpe's Children Foundation, a charity designed to fight poverty with education and take orphaned and destitute children off the streets of the Third World and into residential primary education. The SCF was launched at Apsley House, once home of the Duke of Wellington, in October 2010. Team India, sponsored by The Sharpe's Children Foundation and made up of children who lived in railway carriages at Delhi Railway Station and who played football in the railway yards, won The Street Children's World Cup in Durban, South Africa in 2010. The Sharpe's Children Foundation was chosen as World Charity of The Year in 2012 by Intellectual Property Magazine and was integrated with The Consortium for Street Children later that year.

Because none of them could win after years, they decided to use the Chuhehanjie to divide China into two parts, with the eastern part to Xiang Yu and western part to Liu Bang after negotiation. Liu Bang broke this agreement later when Xiang Yu retreated from Xingyang to rescue the capital of his territory, which was attacked by Han Xin.

The University of Virginia spherical gantry, an example of a modern image-based gonioreflectometer A gonioreflectometer is a device for measuring a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). The device consists of a light source illuminating the material to be measured and a sensor that captures light reflected from that material. The light source should be able to illuminate and the sensor should be able to capture data from a hemisphere around the target. The hemispherical rotation dimensions of the sensor and light source are the four dimensions of the BRDF. The 'gonio' part of the word refers to the device's ability to measure at different angles. Several similar devices have been built and used to capture data for similar functions. Most of these devices use a camera instead of the light intensity-measuring sensor to capture a two-dimensional sample of the target. Examples include: *a spatial gonioreflectometer for capturing the SBRDF (McAllister, 2002). *a camera gantry for capturing the light field (Levoy and Hanrahan, 1996). *an unnamed device for capturing the bidirectional texture function (Dana et al., 1999).

He contributed to most major magazines in the 1950s and 1960s, signing his work ‚ÄúGallagher.‚Äù He won the National Cartoonist Society Gag Cartoon Award in 1957 and 1971.  Early life  John Joseph Gallagher was born January 24, 1926 in Englewood, New Jersey. His parents were George and Gertrude Gallagher. He was the eldest of three children. One brother was Gerald, who became an attorney and the other was George ‚ÄúGately‚Äù Gallagher who created the popular comic strip, Heathcliff. Gallagher‚Äôs father, renowned for his sense of humor, was a longshoreman who had always wished to be a cartoonist. He and his wife encouraged John‚Äôs and George‚Äôs artwork. John Gallagher began drawing Mickey Mouse and Popeye at the age of three. After John and George became professional cartoonists, their father clipped hundreds of cartoons from magazines and glued them in spiral bound notebooks for their reference. John grew up in Bergenfield, New Jersey and graduated from Bergenfield High School in 1944. He drew cartoons for ‚ÄúThe B Hive‚Äù, the school newspaper, as well as the school yearbook, ‚ÄúCrossroads.‚Äù After he graduated high school, John went into the Navy. He served as a Signalman aboard a destroyer escort which was en route to invade Japan when the war ended. John attended Syracuse University School of Art on the G.I. Bill. While attending Syracuse, he did illustrations and cartoons for ‚ÄúThe Syracusan‚Äù the university magazine. It was there he met cartoonist Brad (Marmaduke) Anderson, who became his lifelong friend. Anderson showed him how to put together cartoons for submission to magazines. After two years, John transferred to Pratt Institute, majoring in Illustration.  Career  In 1951, his senior year at Pratt, John sold his first cartoon to The Saturday Evening Post. In January, 1951, he married Dorothy ‚ÄúDot‚Äù Lotter, whom he first met while in grammar school. After his graduation from Pratt, they moved to New York City where he became a staff artist for the Howell- Rojin Agency, which helped pioneer TV ‚Äúgreen screen‚Äù technology, still used today by TV news weathermen. At this time, he began to submit cartoons regularly. When his freelance career began to take off, he and his wife moved back to Bergenfield, New Jersey. For the next 20 years, Gallagher enjoyed an immensely successful gag cartoon freelancing career. His cartoons appeared in magazines such as The Saturday Evening Post, Collier‚Äôs, American Legion Magazine, Sport, Military Life, True, Golf, Argosy, Parade, 1000 Jokes Magazine, For Laughing Out Loud, Saga and Boys‚Äô Life. He once said his best work appeared in 1000 Jokes Magazine. In the late 1960s he created a regular feature for Boys‚Äô Life called ‚ÄúThe Cartoon Bug.‚Äù Aspiring young cartoonists submitted their best work and Gallagher critiqued their work and published it with succinct comments on the art of cartooning. They received $25 for their efforts. After the feature ran its course in Boys‚Äô Life it was syndicated, appearing biweekly in newspapers in the United States and Canada. When the magazine cartoon markets began to dry up in the late 1960s, John left freelancing and became Art Director for American Kitchen Foods, where he designed packaging and promotional material for their new frozen French fry products, including ‚ÄúTasti Fries.‚Äù Later, he drew more than a hundred oversized industrial safety posters for Marlin Industries, where his cartoonist friend Herb Green was Art Director. During this period, he also began a long association with fellow cartoonist Bob Weber, supplying gags for his syndicated comic strip, Moose. When his brother, George Gately, launched his popular syndicated newspaper comic panel, Heathcliff (McNaught/Creator‚Äôs Syndicate), in 1971, Gallagher became involved in all creative aspects of the feature. He was Heathcliff‚Äôs primary gagwriter and layout penciler until shortly before his death. Today, the comic strip is drawn by their nephew, Peter Gallagher. He received the National Cartoonist Society Gag Cartoon Award for 1957 and 1971 for his work.  Later life and death  John Gallagher died at age 79 on March 17, 2005 of complications from emphysema. Jack (to his family and friends) and Dot had four children, five grandchildren and nine nieces and nephews. His papers have been donated to The Billy Ireland Cartoon Library and Museum in Columbus, Ohio.

() is the national commercial radio station for the Isle of Man. It began broadcasting on 29 June 1964, almost ten years before commercial radio was licensed in the United Kingdom. The Isle of Man, having its own government and laws, was not subject to the rules prohibiting commercial broadcasting in the UK. However, the Manx Government still had to apply to the UK's General Post Office for a frequency and for permission to broadcast. First requested in 1960, a licence was eventually granted in May 1964. It was allocated an FM frequency of 89.0 MHz and a comparatively low power of 50 watts. In October 1964, an additional frequency of 1600 kHz AM was allocated to the station to provide greater coverage, although again at a limited power of 50 watts. It broadcasts mainly in English with a few hours a week devoted to broadcasting in Manx. Current frequencies Manx Radio now broadcasts on 1368 kHz AM to the whole island; 89.0 MHz (from Snaefell) for the north of the island; 97.2 MHz FM (from Douglas/Carnane) for the south of the island; and 103.7 MHz (from Jurby) for the island's hills. Additional low-power transmitters cover Ramsey and Peel on a frequency of 89.5 MHz. The station's FM and AM services are also available online Financial dependency Manx Radio's commercial revenues in 2018 accounted for over 60% of its revenues. To provide the public service element of its output it received a government subvention of ¬£875,000 as well as government support for its transmission networks and its coverage of the TT. Company structure Manx Radio is the island's public service broadcaster. It was originally run by the Isle of Man Broadcasting Commission, a state- owned body, under the name Isle of Man Broadcasting Company. In 1980 the company was moved to an arms-length operation using the name Radio Manx Limited (the on-air name did not change). Since 1994, the shares in Radio Manx Limited have been held by the Manx Radio Trust, further distancing the station from Tynwald. Nevertheless, the company remains responsible to Tynwald and its operations are reviewed annually. Manx Radio TT During the Isle of Man TT races, the 1368 kHz frequency becomes Manx Radio TT, providing news and results on the races. The service is also available on 87.9 FM in Douglas and 100.6 FM in Sulby. Regulars Chris Williams, Chris Kinley and Tim Glover can all be heard each day, John Moss presents the Manx Radio TT news bulletins. In May 2012, Radio TT was re-branded as Manx Radio TT 365 to signify that the station was available to listen to throughout the year via the Internet. The service incorporated archive commentary recordings with classic music tracks, as well as the TT fortnight broadcasts. However, after less than a year the service was subsequently closed. Manx Radio TT recommenced its usual service in May 2013. In 2015 and 2016, the service was broadcast as Vauxhall Radio TT. = Isle of Man TT Radio= In 2019 the traditional race coverage service was broadcast under the name of Isle of Man TT Radio, under terms agreed by the Department for Enterprise and Manx Radio for the 2019 TT and Festival of Motorcycling. The agreement resulted the removal of all Manx Radio TT branding from its coverage and the end of it being able to sell its own advertising for race coverage. The commentary and race coverage carried only an hourly announcement that said ‚Äôthis service is provided by Manx Radio‚Äô. It is possible that future radio coverage of the TT will be put out to commercial tender. Presenters =Notable presenters= *David Callister *Bob Carswell *Austin Powell Manx Radio news Manx Radio employs a team of broadcast & digital journalists, responsible for hourly news bulletins, the news orientated Breakfast Show (7:30-9:30am), Mannin Line (noon - 1pm) and Update (5:30 - 6pm). They also produce a range of other shows focussing on news and local politics including 'Perspective' at noon on Sunday and a range of sport updates and shows. Transmitter reuse A deal between United Christian Broadcasters (UCB) and Manx Radio saw UCB broadcast via Manx Radio from 5 October 1987 for an hour on a Sunday from 9pm on the AM transmitter. Since September 2015, Radio Caroline has been broadcasting 'live' for one weekend each month as \\"Radio Caroline North\\" (with original DJs and a mixed sixties, seventies and eighties music content and jingles) from its former home the MV Ross Revenge on the Blackwater Estuary in Essex, via Manx Radio's 1368 kHz 20 kW transmitter.

He is known as Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya by the members of the Gayatri Pariwar. He pioneered the revival of spirituality and creative integration of the modern and ancient sciences and religion. Served restlessly from teenage till his last breath (He took Nirvana) . Pt. Shri Ram Sharma Acharya popularly known as gurudev by his disciples set forth an example before the whole world of enlightenment of most one's soul by practicing the world's ancient found literature's most famous Sanskrit Chant -\\"THE GAYATRI MANTRA\\"  Birth and early life  Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya was born on 20 September 1911, to Pandit Roop Kishore Sharma and Mata Daan Kunwari Devi in Aanwalkheda village, near Agra in Uttar Pradesh, India.. His father Roop Kishore Sharma was a scholar of the Bhagavata Purana (also known as the Srimad Bhagavatam) and he traveled widely to give religious discourses on the Bhagavatam. Roop Kishore was also the classmate and close associate of Indian educationist, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya who founded the Banaras Hindu University. Later, when Shriram became eight years of age, Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya solemnized Shriram's sacred thread ceremony (Yagyopaveet) and initiated him in the Gayatri Mantra. Shriram completed his elementary education from the primary school in his village, and his father taught him Sanskrit Grammar on the basis of Laghu Kaumudi and Sidhanta Kaumudi. Traveling with his father, as the latter visited various Princes and Maharajahs, and listening to his father impart religious discourses in their courts, Shriram achieved proficiency in the Bhagavata Purana too. Shriram visited the Himalayas four times for higher spiritual attainments and took active part in Indian freedom movement and was sent to jail three times. In 1943, he married Bhagavati Devi Sharma,'Evolution of a Divine Mission: Chronological Compendium', in Hamsa Yoga: The Elixir of Self-Realization (Soham SƒÅdhanƒÅ). who assisted her husband in running the Gayatri Parivar and took over its running upon his death in 1990.Lise McKean, Divine Enterprise: Gurus and the Hindu Nationalist Movement (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996), p. 45 .  First Meeting With His Guru  According to Shriram Sharma when he was fifteen years of age, he had an encounter with Sri Sarveshwarananda , a Yogi who resided in an astral body. Describing this encounter Shriram writes:  Participation in Indian Freedom Movement  Shriram Sharma on a 1991 stamp of India Fellow freedom fighters nicknamed him \\"Matta\\" (the Intoxicated, obsessed, completely devoted to the idea of a Free India) on account of his dedication and devotion.Sri Ram Sharma Acharya. Indian Post. Retrieved on 6 December 2018. Much of his writing and poetry were published in the Hindi newspaper Sainik (soldier) under the nickname of Matta. He was arrested for breaking prohibitory orders in April 1931 in Agra but released shortly afterwards. Undeterred, he announced a flag procession in the village of Parakhi near his home village Awalkhera. The government again issued prohibitory orders and the police force attacked the procession with batons. Shriram was struck unconscious and carried to a nearby hospital. In 1933, he left for Kolkata to attend the Rashtriya Adhivation (national meeting) of Congress, but was arrested and sent to Asansol jail with other national leaders such as Mahamana Madan Mohan Malaviya, Swaruparani Nehru, Devdas Gandhi, Rafi Ahmad Kidwai etc.  The yearning for literature  To help people, his aim was to diagnose the root cause of the ailing state of the world today and enable the upliftment of society. He recognized the crisis of faith, people‚Äôs ignorance of the powers of the inner self, and the lack of righteous attitude and conduct. Realizing the potential of inspirational literature and its importance in sparking an intellectual evolution, he had chosen writing as the principal mode towards uprooting the evil tendencies and blind faith from people‚Äôs minds and replacing it with wisdom, strength and spiritual bliss. Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya initiated the movement of VICHAR KRANTI (Thought Revolution) with the very first issue of Akhand Jyoti. By 1960, he had compiled and translated the 4 Vedas, 108 Upanishads, 6 Darshanas, 18 Puranas, Yogavasishtha and various Aranyakas and Brahmanas with lucid commentaries to enable the masses to understand the knowledge contained in them. The translation was also aimed at eliminating misconceptions, superstitions and blind customs, which were propagated in the medieval era by misinterpretations of the Vedas and other scriptures. This contribution to the world of knowledge and human culture was highly acclaimed and appreciated by scholars like Dr S Radhakrishnan, Acharya Vinoba Bhave; the distinguished title of \\"Vedmurti\\" was conferred upon him in its recognition.\\"Yugrishi Vedmurti Taponishtha Pt. Sriram Sharma Acharya: Seer-Sage of the New Golden Era\\" Akhand-Jyoti (bimonthly) Jan‚ÄìFeb 2003 Understanding the modern day psychology of the people, and recognizing the non-relevance, in the present times, of the mythical characters and the background of life depicted in the Puranas, he wrote \\"Pragya Purana\\" in the narrative and conversational style of the ancient Puranas to preach the eternal principles of happy, progressive and ideal life with practical guidance relevant to the modern age. He wrote many books on almost all aspects of human life, whether it be the elucidation of the esoteric aspects of the subtle science of spirituality, research directions on brain and consciousness, discussions on child psychology and family institutions, guidelines on mental, emotional and physical health, and cheerful attitude in daily life. His discourses manifested a similar sense of eloquence. The simplicity of language in his orations and his ability to establish a rapport with the audience is said to have had a hypnotizing effect on the listener‚Äôs mind.  Establishment of Shantikunj and Brahmavarchas  According to the pressing need of the modern times, he established Shantikunj in Haridwar, as a spiritual center for implementing the teachings of different Rishis. He also established the Brahmavarchas Research Institute in Haridwar, a center for inter communion of science and spirituality, where interrelation between these two aspects is studied. The prime aim of setting up this Institute is to establish the ancient Indian Yogic Philosophy as the science and art of living. Acharyaji pioneered the resurrection of the rishi culture by a simultaneous renaissance and expansion of the reformative and constructive endeavours of the leading rishis of the Vedic Age. He reviewed the immortal contributions of the divine culture of India to the rest of the world and endeavoured for nurturing and re-establishing the foundational elements of the Indian Culture and the roots of its divine nature in new scientific light through several activities of the Gayatri Pariwar. As a part of his intensive study of the Indian culture and religious philosophy, he rediscovered the sociological and psychological importance of pilgrimage. He taught how the ancient glory and the real purpose of the tirthas (sacred places of pilgrimage) could be revived in the present times for the welfare of the masses. Dev Sanskriti Vishwavidyalaya (the Divine Culture University) inaugurated in 2002 posthumously, under the auspices of Shantikunj is an instrument for the revival of the Divine Indian Culture as per his vision.  The dawn of the New Era  During 1984‚Äì1986, he carried out the unique spiritual experiment of sukshmikara√±a, meaning sublimation of vital force and physical, mental and spiritual energies. He authored a special set of 40 books (termed Revolutionary Literature or Krantidharmi Sahitya) highlighting the future of the world and conveying the message of the dawn of the New Era of Truth during the 21st Century.  The formation of Yugrishi Shriram Sharma Acharya Charitable Trust  With ideals and teachings of Pandit Ji, the YUGRISHI SHRIRAM SHARMA ACHARYA CHARITABLE TRUST (registration No: 4981/2004) was formed in 2004 initially to work for the welfare of the poor and downtrodden in Bihar as the state had always been a laggard on all aspects of human well-being. The trust was formed by Shree Ramesh Chandra Shukla (1917-) ‚Äì a social reformer of the 20th century and a disciple of Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya. The trust has a purpose driven approach with an uncompromising attitude towards values and beliefs. The primary source of such values and beliefs are the 3 pillars of spiritual/purposeful life (Upasana, Sadhana and Aradhana) and the 7 areas of evolutionary development (for a better world) as preached and clarified by Pandit Shriram Sharma Acharya. The trust works on the 7 areas (of evolutionary development)- Health, Education, Awakening of Women, Environment, Eliminating Social Evils, Entrepreneurship and promoting spirituality. The underlying purpose of the trust has been to improve the quality of life of people so that their activities will finally help people to overcome social, economic and psychological barriers and usher positive change. With this theory of change in mind the trust started the Akhand Jyoti Eye hospital in December 2005 at village Mastichak, 60 km away from the capital city of Patna. Akhand Jyoti Eye Hospital was founded by Mr. Mritunjay Tiwari (grandson of Shree Ramesh Chandra Shukla) as part of his spiritual awakening process which happened through a chance visit to Bihar (his parental roots are in Bihar) wherein he witnessed a father selling off his girl child for a mere one thousand five hundred rupees. Mritunjay till then was an urban businessman and his world view was through his business insight. This incident shook him, and he realized that his world was nowhere close to reality. People in low-income regions of India lives in extreme poverty. Lack of education among the masses compounds the problem and the poor are treated as the downtrodden. Thereafter the trust resolved to only work in the low-income geographies of India. Today, Akhand Jyoti Eye Hospital - a unit of Yugrishi Shriram Sharma Acharya Charitable Trust works to eradicate curable blindness from low-income regions of India by providing affordable, accessible, sustainable, quality curative and preventive eye care services, and empower rural girls/women to achieve this.

Bedel was born in Salem, New Hampshire. During the French and Indian War he served as a lieutenant in the New Hampshire Provincial Regiment at Fort at Number 4, Crown Point, Fortress Louisbourg, the capture of Quebec and later at the capture of Havana, Cuba. Bedel served in the New Hampshire colonial and state assembly during and after the war and was elected to the break away assembly to create New Connecticut which became known as the Vermont Republic. Bedel and his wife Elizabeth had a son named Moody Bedel, born on May 12, 1764, who became a brigadier general during the War of 1812. Moody Bedel held a grant of land in Northern New Hampshire, known as Bedel's Grant. Subsequently the area was settled by John Haynes and others and the Indian Stream Republic was formed (1785-1842) in the area that is now Pittsburgh, New Hampshire. Moody Bedel's son John Bedel was a brigadier general of volunteers during the American Civil War. Bedel lived in Bath, New Hampshire between 1769 and 1775.David Library of the American Revolution: Timothy Bedel Papers Retrieved 2018-08-18. American Revolution On May 26, 1775, Timothy Bedel, a member of the New Hampshire provincial assembly representing Bath, was appointed to command a company of rangers to be raised at Coos, New Hampshire (an Abenaki name for a place variously spelled cowasuk, cohos, or Koes), a military command located in Haverhill, New Hampshire and Newbury, Vermont where natives gathered to transport people and goods into Canada. Bedel recruited a unit which quickly grew into a regiment of eight companies. He became a colonel in the New Hampshire militia to protect the northern frontier of New Hampshire in an area of disputed land Grants between Fort at Number 4 and Crown Point. A contemporary soldier of the French and Indian War with whom he served, William Stark, an older brother of John Stark, also wanted this command, and when turned down William Stark joined the British Army. Bedel's Regiment joined the Continental Army during the Invasion of Canada. Bedel saw action at the Siege of Fort St. Jean. When his unit arrived he was the senior regimental commander. His command was criticized by General Richard Montgomery for overspending and wasting of provisions, particularly rum. He missed the Battle of the Cedars while he was ill at the hospital at Lachine, Quebec. At The Cedars, most of Bedel's Regiment was captured by the British and their Native American allies. Eight days later his men were exchanged for British soldiers captured at the St. Jean. Both Bedel and his second-in-command, Major Isaac Butterfield, were court-martialed for the disaster at The Cedars. Bedel was found not guilty and Butterfield was found guilty of cowardice. Bedel's Regiment was disbanded on January 1, 1777, when enlistments expired. He recruited a series of ranger regiments for New Hampshire. Part of his command became part of the Green Mountain Boys at the Battle of Quebec. Bedel served as a 1st Lieutenant in a militia regiment at the Battle of Bennington under general John Stark, became a staff officer for generals Philip Schuyler and Horatio Gates at Saratoga concerning Indian affairs, and was restored to regimental command. On December 11, 1779, General George Washington ordered Colonel Bedel to raise another regiment at Coos to help Colonel Moses Hazen and General Jacob Bayley in the construction of a possible invasion route to Canada and to conduct an investigation of misconduct and fraud against the Continental Army Quartermaster at Coos, New Hampshire. Later years After the war, Bedel worked unsuccessfully to have lands in northern New Hampshire and Vermont granted to Abenakis who had sided with the United States during the war. Some early histories state that Bedel became a general in the New Hampshire, Vermont, or New York militia, but historian Albert Batchellor could find no evidence of this and believed it to be an error because Bedel was always addressed by his contemporaries as \\"Colonel\\".

An accelerated northward course followed, leading to the hurricane's landfall along the Louisiana coast on June 16\\\\. It weakened over land and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on June 18, accelerating northeast towards the Canadian Maritimes thereafter. The storm's slow track over Central America between June 5‚Äì8 led to copious rainfall and triggered deadly floods; El Salvador and Honduras suffered most among Central American countries. Rainfall totals exceeded in some areas. Fourteen rivers in El Salvador rose above their banks. Entire villages in El Salvador were destroyed by the floods, with damage extensive in the country's interior and along its Pacific coast. Communications with El Salvador were downed for 36 hours. Extensive damage to crops and infrastructure occurred in and around San Salvador, where at least 2,000 people may have perished; property damage totaled $2 million (1934 USD) in the city. The hurricane was especially deadly in Honduras, primarily west and north of Tegucigalpa. In Ocotepeque, torrential rainfall caused a landslide that formed a natural dam, allowing floodwater to accumulate behind it. The dam failed on June 7, and the resulting debris flow downstream destroyed most of Ocotepeque and killed an estimated 468 people. The Yucat√°n Peninsula's sparse population mitigated significant damage when the hurricane struck Quintana Roo on June 9, though crops were impacted between Progreso and Payo Obispo. Much of the shores of the Gulf of Mexico were affected by the hurricane due to its erratic path. High winds and coastal floods stemming from swells generated by the storm reached Tamaulipas and Brazos Island along the western extents of Gulf of Mexico, while a stationary front tapped into moisture from the storm to produce heavy rainfall across southern Georgia and Florida. The worst of hurricane's impacts associated with its landfall in Louisiana were caused by the storm's rainbands that raked across Louisiana and Mississippi ahead of the hurricane's center. Six people were killed in Louisiana and four were killed in Mississippi. Approximately 3,000‚Äì7,000 homes were damaged in Louisiana. The storm continued to produce high winds and flooding rainfall as it tracked northeast across the Mid-Atlantic states and into Canada, causing power outages and property damage. Meteorological history The circumstances leading to the storm's formation in the western Caribbean Sea were unclear, marked only by inclement weather in the Gulf of Honduras. An area of low pressure developed in the area and organized into a tropical depression by 12:00 UTC on June 4, strengthening into a tropical storm six hours later. The following day, the cyclone made landfall near Belize City in the British Honduras with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph (80 km/h). Over the next two days, the storm took a looping path primarily through Guatemala. Although interaction with land initially weakened the cyclone, the storm's winds quickly increased when it passed near Guatemala's Pacific coast. It re-entered the Gulf of Honduras on a northward path early on June 8 and strengthened into a hurricane by June 9. Concurrently, it curved towards the west, leading to a landfall along the Yucat√°n Peninsula on June 9 with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h). The next day, the system moved into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm on a northwestward heading. Two days later, the storm executed another loop, restrengthening into a hurricane before taking a northward course. Observations from ships in the vicinity of the hurricane were suggestive of an intensifying system. On June 14, the storm attained winds of 100 mph (160 km/h), ranking it as a Category 2 hurricane intensity on the modern Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale. It held this intensity for two days and made landfall along the coast of Louisiana near Jeanerette at 19:00 UTC on June 16. Upon landfall, the storm's barometric pressure was 966 mbar (hPa; 28.53 inHg). The hurricane weakened and accelerated towards the northeast after moving ashore, though the swampy terrain of coastal Louisiana curtailed the weakening process. The storm's winds decreased below hurricane strength on June 17 and fell further to tropical depression strength on June 18 as the system tracked across Mississippi and Tennessee. Its entanglement with an approaching cold front on June 18 signaled the storm's transition into an extratropical cyclone. The storm continued towards the northeastern United States and the Canadian Maritimes, tracking across Nova Scotia and the northern shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence before it was last documented on June 21 over Labrador. Impact = Central America and Southeastern Mexico = alt=View of the Lempa River near Octoepeque, Honduras Between June 5‚Äì8, the center of the storm slowly tracked across British Honduras, southeastern Mexico, and Guatemala, with estimated peak sustained winds of along this path. These peak winds were measured in San Salvador, El Salvador. Lesser winds of 34 mph (55 km/h) were recorded in Belize City, British Honduras, where the storm initially made landfall. The slow-moving tropical cyclone produced torrential rainfall, resulting in widespread flooding that killed several thousand people. Estimates of the death toll in Central America vary; a list of the deadliest Atlantic tropical cyclones compiled by meteorologists Edward Rappaport and Jose Fernandez-Partag√°s in 1996 indicates that the hurricane may have caused over 3,000 fatalities, with a low-end estimate of 506. Between 1,000‚Äì3,000 casualties occurred across Honduras according to the U.S. Weather Bureau's report in the Monthly Weather Review. Relief workers in Honduras suggested approximately 2,000 fatalities occurred, while reporting by the Associated Press estimated at least 2,000 deaths near San Salvador with at least 2,500 deaths across Central America. Rainfall totals exceeded in some locations, increased by the effects of the mountains of the Trifinio region. In El Salvador, the storm contributed to the country's wettest year on record; this record stood until 2005. Rivers and lakes rose from the excessive rains. Banana and timber regions were heavily impacted by the storm. The worst effects were felt in El Salvador and Honduras, with lesser impacts occurring in Guatemala. The heaviest damage in El Salvador occurred in the departments of Caba√±as, Cuscatl√°n, La Paz, San Miguel, San Vicente, and Usulut√°n. Fourteen rivers throughout the country overflowed their banks, with floods along the Lempa proving to be particularly devastating in northwestern El Salvador. Entire villages in El Salvador were destroyed, including those along the Pacific coast of El Salvador from La Libertad to La Uni√≥n. On a single estate along the coast, 100,000 head of cattle perished. All Pacific ports were flooded; few buildings withstood the storm in Acajutla, whose port was rendered inoperable. Verapaz was wrecked by floods rushing down the slopes of a nearby volcano. Power lines were brought down by the storm, with communications company All America Cables reporting an inability to connect with the country for 36 hours. A report from San Salvador described \\"considerable damage\\" arising from flooding. Property damage totaled $2 million (1934 USD) and initial reports tallied 500 people rendered homeless near the city. Large buildings in the city were damaged and homes were washed away in the residential districts of Ilopango and Soyapango. The 30-foot (9 m) rise of Lake Ilopango destroyed buildings along its banks. Similarly, flooding along the banks of Lake G√ºija and the Coatepeque Caldera washed away settlements along their shores. A partially-completed stadium intended for the Central American and Caribbean Games in December 1934 was flooded, forcing to event to be delayed to March 1935. Substantial damage was also wrought to crops around San Salvador. Long segments of the international railroad of Central America were washed out, requiring three months of repairs; one train on its tracks derailed. Bridges were torn apart by the flooding, with washouts and landslides reported on railways and highways. Washouts occurred on nearly all roads throughout the country. On June 8, martial law was declared in El Salvador, with an early curfew enforced in San Salvador. Electricity was restored in the city between June 9‚Äì10 while potable water was made available twice daily. Churches and other public buildings served as havens for those displaced by the storm in San Salvador. The government of El Salvador seized all gasoline in San Salvador to ensure adequate supplies for emergency transport. A decree from the president enacted price controls on food and suspended import duties on cereal for three months. Hundreds of men were pressed into service by the presidents to repair highways. The American Red Cross contributed $10,000 towards relief for victims of the hurricane in the country. alt=Photograph of a church Rains from the hurricane affected Honduras for nine days. The storm disrupted transportation service in Honduras, completely isolating Tegucigalpa. Low-lying areas of the capital city were flooded as the R√≠o Grande quickly rose due to heavy rainfall. The storm destroyed homes in San Juancito. Banana-growing regions along the Atlantic coast were also heavily impacted; plantations near Santiago were inundated in floodwaters, and large plantations owned by the United Fruit Company were destroyed. Rail service to these areas was suspended due to the flooding. The worst impacts in Honduras occurred in districts west and north of Tegucigalpa. On June 4, 25.2 in (64 cm) of rain fell in Ocotepeque, Honduras, triggering a landslide in a mountain valley above the city. The landslide acted as a natural dam along the southern slope of Cerro El Pital . Rainfall accumulated in a lake formed behind this temporary obstruction as the storm meandered over Central America. On June 7, the barrier burst, producing a debris flow that killed an estimated 468 people, representing over 10 percent of Ocotepeque's population. The town was largely destroyed, with all buildings succumbing to the flood except for the town church. Despite the magnitude of the disaster, contemporary reports were scarce due to the city's remote location and lack of communications. The destruction caused the city to be relocated 2.5 mi (4 km) north, where it was named Nueva Ocotepeque; the former city was later resettled slightly outside the floodplain of the R√≠o Marchala and renamed as Antigua Ocotepeque. The Lempa and Ul√∫a rivers rose significantly due to the rainfall, with the latter rising . Residents of Pimienta fled to a hill to avoid advancing floodwaters only to be drowned there as the Ul√∫a River continued to rise. Hundreds of cattle also drowned in Pimienta. More than 125 buildings were destroyed in the city with property losses estimated at $500,000. At Villanueva, floods were deep. Honduran president Tiburcio Car√≠as Andino appealed to American officials in Panama for tents due to the displacement of Ocotepeque residents. A total of 65 tents were delivered by 11 bombers to Tegucigalpa on June 16. Serum for combating disease in storm- stricken Honduras and El Salvador was prepared and sent to San Salvador for distribution. The American Red Cross allocated $1,000 towards relief for those affected by the hurricane in Honduras. Six people were killed in the Mexican state of Chiapas following a plane crash, possibly due to strong winds from the storm. After completing its loop over Central America and reemerging into the Caribbean Sea, the storm made landfall as a on Quintana Roo on June 9, producing hurricane-force winds inland over the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Due to the region's sparse population, there were no reports of significant damage. The storm damaged crops between Progreso and Payo Obispo. Ships were sunk in the harbor at Progreso. = Northern Mexico and Northern America = alt=Contour map of rainfall totals in Florida and Georgia Along the U.S. Gulf Coast ahead of the storm, a semi-stationary weather front across southern Georgia and northern Florida drew moist air from the hurricane, causing heavy rains over central and northern Florida; the maximum rainfall total in the state was as recorded in St. Leo. The storm's trajectory on June 11 suggested a possible track towards the Mexican coast between Tampico and the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. Swells ahead of the storm flooded roads in low-lying areas of Brazos Island and cut off the beach at Playa Miramar. Buildings were boarded up in the Rio Grande Valley in preparation for the hurricane. In Tampico, hospitals, police, and the Red Cross prepared for the storm. Bus fleets were readied for potential evacuations. High winds ultimately reached the coast of Tamaulipas on June 13 with little impact. Northeast storm warnings were issued for the U.S. Gulf Coast between Pensacola, Florida, and Morgan City, Louisiana, on June 15\\\\. Hurricane warnings were later issued on June 16 for the Louisiana coast between Grand Isle and Vermilion Bay. These warnings were disseminated via radiophone, telegraph, and telephone. A cutter from the United States Coast Guard was sent to alert ships of the storm's approach at Mobile Bay. The hurricane moved ashore Louisiana at on June 16, passing over Jeanerette, west of Morgan City. Along the coast, shrimp-drying platforms and oil derricks incurred $105,000 in damage. However, the hurricane's small size reduced the resulting storm surge, leading to maximum storm tide heights of between Grand Isle and Vermilion Bay. The storm's most destructive effects were associated with squalls that swept across Louisiana and Mississippi in advance of the storm's landfall. These localized storms felled trees throughout New Orleans. Winds in Morgan City reached as the hurricane made landfall. There, homes lost their roofs and chimneys. A rainfall maximum of was recorded in Lafayette. Six people were killed in Louisiana and the property damage toll reached $2.605 million. The American Red Cross estimated that 75‚Äì150 homes were destroyed and that another 3,000‚Äì7,000 were damaged. An additional $1.5 million damage toll was inflicted upon crops, including corn and cotton. Corn and cotton crops recovered soon after the hurricane's passage. Squalls associated with the hurricane killed four people and injuring many others in Mississippi. Gusty winds destroyed and unroofed homes in Natchez. The storms produced heavy rainfall across western parts of the state, elevating the Pearl River above flood stage by between Monticello and Jackson. Mississippi crops sustained $3 million in losses. In Tennessee's Red River Valley, crops and roads sustained $250,000 in damage from excessive rainfall. Cedar Hill, Tennessee, recorded of rain in 14 hours; this was the heaviest June rain event in state history. A -wide tornado struck a rural area north of Joelton, Tennessee on June 17, damaging a few farm buildings. The tropical storm proceeded to produce strong winds and rainfall over New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. A -wind was measured in Atlantic City, New Jersey, as the storm emerged into the Atlantic. The extratropical remnants of the hurricane passed over the Canadian Maritimes with sustained winds of up to 40 mph (65 km/h). The storm caused power outages between Sorel and Montreal, Quebec. Poles were toppled along the Canadian National Railway between the two cities. A fire caused by the storm destroyed three barns near Verch√®res; eight other barns were destroyed throughout Quebec. The storm also caused flooding in Ontario, inundating some of the main streets in Toronto.

This church was organized over 300 years ago, and has contributed to the creation of a number of Baptist churches nearby. Founding The origins of the Fuller Baptist church stretch back as far as 1666, when the first Nonconformist meetings commenced in Kettering following the Act of Uniformity 1662. That was when Mr Maydwell, the Rector of Kettering, left the Parish Church to establish the Independent Meeting. The first entry, in the Old Church Book, which is undated, lists amongst its members a Mr William Wallis who, with six other members, was dismissed from membership for being an Anabaptist. In October 1696 these men set up their own fellowship in a house in Bayley's Yard, Newland Street, with William Wallis as their pastor, and this formed the first Baptist Church in Kettering, and from which the Fuller Church ultimately grew. At about the same time a second Baptist fellowship was established in Goosepasture Lane (now Meadow Road) under the leadership of Mr Wills, formerly pastor of the Independent Meeting but who also had been dismissed from membership. Around 1729 the two separate Baptist meetings merged, meeting together for worship on the common basis of believers baptism and open communion. The church soon was in need of its own burial ground but the buildings in Goosepasture Lane had little or no land attached. Mr Beeby Wallis (the great-grandson of William Wallis the pastor), made available to the church his house, warehouse, barn, stable yard and gardens situated in Gold Street; this property was worth a total of ¬£350, but was bought by the church for ¬£139 14s 9d. By 1775 under the leadership of George Moreton of Arnesby, the membership had risen to 75. However, not long after Mr Moreton was forced to give his resignation due to ill health, and a young minister named Andrew Fuller was approached. Fuller was minister at Soham at the time and was reluctant to leave his small flock, but after consulting with nine of his fellow ministers, Fuller eventually and reluctantly accepted the call and, together with his family, moved to Kettering in October 1782. Enlargement Andrew Fuller brought life and vigour to the church. He was a prolific writer and a powerful preacher. By 1786 it was considered necessary to enlarge the Chapel at a cost of ¬£133. In the same year a daughter church - Gretton Chapel - became independent of the Kettering church. In 1792 Fuller helped in the creation of what was to become the Baptist Missionary Society, but it was also the year Beeby Wallis and Fuller's own wife died. Two years later Fuller married Ann Coles, the daughter of the Reverend William Coles of Ampthill and found in his new wife \\"the perfect helpmeet\\". By 1805 a further rebuilding of the chapel was required, and the building was lengthened by 18 feet and the walls raised by 4 feet, and now could contain 900 people. Fuller died on Sunday, 7 May 1815. It was estimated that 2000 people attended his funeral. Fuller was succeeded by his assistant, John Keen Hall, who died in 1829 at the age of 43. In 1851 the Sunday School had 534 children attending on Sunday mornings and 625 in the afternoon. Gas lighting was introduced into the Chapel in 1846. Revd James Mursell, whose ministry began in March 1853, had an \\"exciting and innovative\\" ministry. It was during his time that the new chapel was built. The Fuller Chapel, as it was named, opened for worship on 24 September 1861. James Mursell served until January 1870. By 1884 the membership had risen to 410. In July 1891 the foundation stone of a mission hall in Nelson Street was laid, which become what is now known as Carey Memorial Chapel. By 1896 membership of Fuller stood at 720 with a Sunday School of around 2000 children. In 1945 another church plant in Rockingham Road gained its independence (Rockingham Road Baptist Church) and yet another (Corby) became independent in 1956. Modern usage In 1996 Fuller Baptist Church celebrated its 300th Anniversary with a varied programme of events, including Organ Recitals, Sports Day, and evangelistic outreach. Outreach continues through church activities and the Fuller Coffee House.

California, 314 U.S. 219 (1941), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court upheld the criminal conviction and death sentence imposed upon a man who confessed to murder after being detained for more than 24 hours, slapped and deprived of sleep and food.. The petitioner argued that the confession was coerced, and that it violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Facts =Murder of Mary Busch= Major Raymond Lisenba (a.k.a. \\"Robert S. James\\") worked as a barber in La Ca√±ada Flintridge, California in the 1930s. His wife was a manicurist named Mary Busch. In 1935, Lisenba purchased a life insurance policy on his wife. A few months later, he purchased several rattlesnakes, which were used in an unsuccessful attempt to murder his wife. Hours later, Mary was found dead by drowning. Investigators from the insurance company discovered that Lisenba had been married several times previously and that one of his prior wives had died under similar circumstances. =Decision= The majority of the Supreme Court found that the police officers violated state law when they illegally detained Lisenba for two days, assaulted him, and denied him access to counsel. However, the court found that these illegal acts did not themselves constitute a due process violation, asserting that Lisenba had confessed of his own free will after being confronted with the testimony of an accomplice, not directly after the interrogation. Justice Owen J. Roberts' opinion reads, in part: > Counsel had been afforded full opportunity to see [Lisenba] and had advised > him. He exhibited a self-possession, a coolness, and an acumen throughout > his questioning, and at his trial, which negatives the view that he had so > lost his freedom of action that the statements made were not his but were > the result of the deprivation of his free choice to admit, to deny, or to > refuse to answer. = Dissent = Justice Hugo Black, joined by Justice William O. Douglas, used the facts of the case to decide in favor of the petitioner, noting the case's factual similarities to Chambers v. Florida, a landmark 1940 case (argued before the court by future Justice Thurgood Marshall on behalf of the petitioner) in which the court ruled that confessions compelled by police through duress are inadmissible at trial. Black's dissenting opinion describes the circumstances of Lisenba's confession: > Suspecting the defendant of murder they entered his home on Sunday, April > 19, 1936, at 9 a.m. He was taken to a furnished house next door, in which > the State's Attorney's office had installed a dictaphone. For the next > forty-eight hours, or a little longer, the State's Attorney, his assistants, > and investigators held James as their prisoner. He was so held not under > indictment or warrant of arrest but by force. At about 4 a.m. Monday, one > Southard, an investigator, 'slapped' the defendant, whose left ear became > red and swollen. James was apparently kept at the State's Attorney's office > during the daylight hours; the full extent to which he was questioned there > is not clear. But on Monday and Tuesday nights, at the furnished house, with > no one present but James and the officers, he was subjected to constant > interrogation. The questioning officers divided themselves into squads, so > that some could sleep while the others continued the questioning. The > defendant got no sleep during the first forty-two hours after the officers > seized him. And about 3:30 or 4 a.m. Tuesday morning, while sitting in the > chair he occupied while being interrogated, at the very moment a question > was being asked him, the defendant fell asleep. There he remained asleep > until about 7 or 8 a.m. At about 11 a.m. the officers took him to jail and > booked him on a charge of incest. During the entire forty- two hours > defendant was held, he repeatedly denied any complicity in or knowledge of > the murder of his wife.Lisenba, 314 U.S. at 241-42 (Black, J., dissenting).

Elastic energy occurs when objects are impermanently compressed, stretched or generally deformed in any manner. Elasticity theory primarily develops formalisms for the mechanics of solid bodies and materials. (Note however, the work done by a stretched rubber band is not an example of elastic energy. It is an example of entropic elasticity.) The elastic potential energy equation is used in calculations of positions of mechanical equilibrium. The energy is potential as it will be converted into other forms of energy, such as kinetic energy and sound energy, when the object is allowed to return to its original shape (reformation) by its elasticity. : U = \\\\frac12 k\\\\, \\\\Delta x^2\\\\, The essence of elasticity is reversibility. Forces applied to an elastic material transfer energy into the material which, upon yielding that energy to its surroundings, can recover its original shape. However, all materials have limits to the degree of distortion they can endure without breaking or irreversibly altering their internal structure. Hence, the characterizations of solid materials include specification, usually in terms of strains, of its elastic limits. Beyond the elastic limit, a material is no longer storing all of the energy from mechanical work performed on it in the form of elastic energy. Elastic energy of or within a substance is static energy of configuration. It corresponds to energy stored principally by changing the interatomic distances between nuclei. Thermal energy is the randomized distribution of kinetic energy within the material, resulting in statistical fluctuations of the material about the equilibrium configuration. There is some interaction, however. For example, for some solid objects, twisting, bending, and other distortions may generate thermal energy, causing the material's temperature to rise. Thermal energy in solids is often carried by internal elastic waves, called phonons. Elastic waves that are large on the scale of an isolated object usually produce macroscopic vibrations sufficiently lacking in randomization that their oscillations are merely the repetitive exchange between (elastic) potential energy within the object and the kinetic energy of motion of the object as a whole. Although elasticity is most commonly associated with the mechanics of solid bodies or materials, even the early literature on classical thermodynamics defines and uses \\"elasticity of a fluid\\" in ways compatible with the broad definition provided in the Introduction above. Solids include complex crystalline materials with sometimes complicated behavior. By contrast, the behavior of compressible fluids, and especially gases, demonstrates the essence of elastic energy with negligible complication. The simple thermodynamic formula: dU = -P\\\\,dV \\\\ , where dU is an infinitesimal change in recoverable internal energy U, P is the uniform pressure (a force per unit area) applied to the material sample of interest, and dV is the infinitesimal change in volume that corresponds to the change in internal energy. The minus sign appears because dV is negative under compression by a positive applied pressure which also increases the internal energy. Upon reversal, the work that is done by a system is the negative of the change in its internal energy corresponding to the positive dV of an increasing volume. In other words, the system loses stored internal energy when doing work on its surroundings. Pressure is stress and volumetric change corresponds to changing the relative spacing of points within the material. The stress-strain-internal energy relationship of the foregoing formula is repeated in formulations for elastic energy of solid materials with complicated crystalline structure. Elastic potential energy in mechanical systems Components of mechanical systems store elastic potential energy if they are deformed when forces are applied to the system. Energy is transferred to an object by work when an external force displaces or deforms the object. The quantity of energy transferred is the vector dot product of the force and the displacement of the object. As forces are applied to the system they are distributed internally to its component parts. While some of the energy transferred can end up stored as the kinetic energy of acquired velocity, the deformation of component objects results in stored elastic energy. A prototypical elastic component is a coiled spring. The linear elastic performance of spring is parametrized by a constant of proportionality, called the spring constant. This constant is usually denoted as k (see also Hooke's Law) and depends on the geometry, cross-sectional area, undeformed length and nature of the material from which the coil is fashioned. Within a certain range of deformation, k remains constant and is defined as the negative ratio of displacement to the magnitude of the restoring force produced by the spring at that displacement. : k = - \\\\tfrac{F_r}{L-L_{o}} The deformed length, L, can be larger or smaller than Lo, the undeformed length, so to keep k positive, Fr must be given as a vector component of the restoring force whose sign is negative for L>Lo and positive for L< Lo. If the displacement is abbreviated as : (L-L_{o})= x\\\\, then Hooke's Law can be written in the usual form : F_r =\\\\, - k \\\\, x. Energy absorbed and held in the spring can be derived using Hooke's Law to compute the restoring force as a measure of the applied force. This requires the assumption, sufficiently correct in most circumstances, that at a given moment, the magnitude of applied force, Fa is equal to the magnitude of the resultant restoring force, but its direction and thus sign is different. In other words, assume that at each point of the displacement Fa = k x, where Fa is the component of applied force along the x direction : \\\\vec{F_a} \\\\cdot \\\\vec{x} = F_{a}\\\\,x . For each infinitesimal displacement dx, the applied force is simply k x and the product of these is the infinitesimal transfer of energy into the spring dU. The total elastic energy placed into the spring from zero displacement to final length L is thus the integral : U = \\\\int_{0}^{L-L_o}{k\\\\ x\\\\ dx} = \\\\tfrac{1}{2} k (L-L_o)^2 For a material of Young's modulus, Y (same as modulus of elasticity Œª), cross sectional area, A0, initial length, l0, which is stretched by a length, \\\\Delta l: :U_e = \\\\int {\\\\frac{Y A_0 \\\\Delta l} {l_0}}\\\\, d\\\\left(\\\\Delta l\\\\right) = \\\\frac {Y A_0 {\\\\Delta l}^2} {2 l_0} :where Ue is the elastic potential energy. The elastic potential energy per unit volume is given by: :\\\\frac{U_e} {A_0 l_0} = \\\\frac {Y {\\\\Delta l}^2} {2 l_0^2} = \\\\frac {1} {2} Y {\\\\varepsilon}^2 :where \\\\varepsilon = \\\\frac {\\\\Delta l} {l_0} is the strain in the material. In the general case, elastic energy is given by the free energy per unit of volume f as a function of the strain tensor components Œµij : f(\\\\varepsilon_{ij}) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\lambda \\\\varepsilon_{ii}^2 + \\\\mu \\\\varepsilon_{ij}^2 where Œª and Œº are the Lam√© elastical coefficients and we use Einstein summation convention. Noting the thermodynamic connection between stress tensor components and strain tensor components, : \\\\sigma_{ij} = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial \\\\varepsilon_{ij}} \\\\right)_T , where the subscript T denotes that temperature is held constant, then we find that if Hooke's law is valid, we can write the elastic energy density as : f = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\sigma_{ij}. Continuum systems A bulk material can be distorted in many different ways: stretching, shearing, bending, twisting, etc. Each kind of distortion contributes to the elastic energy of a deformed material. In orthogonal coordinates, the elastic energy per unit volume due to strain is thus a sum of contributions: :U = \\\\frac{1}{2} C_{ijkl} \\\\varepsilon_{ij} \\\\varepsilon_{kl} , where C_{ijkl} is a 4th rank tensor, called the elastic, or sometimes stiffness, tensor which is a generalization of the elastic moduli of mechanical systems, and \\\\varepsilon_{ij} is the strain tensor (Einstein summation notation has been used to imply summation over repeated indices). The values of C_{ijkl} depend upon the crystal structure of the material: in the general case, due to symmetric nature of \\\\sigma and \\\\varepsilon, the elastic tensor consists of 21 independent elastic coefficients. This number can be further reduced by the symmetry of the material: 9 for an orthorhombic crystal, 5 for an hexagonal structure, and 3 for a cubic symmetry. Finally, for an isotropic material, there are only two independent parameters, with C_{ijkl} = \\\\lambda\\\\delta_{ij}\\\\delta_{kl} + \\\\mu(\\\\delta_{ik}\\\\delta_{jl}+\\\\delta_{il}\\\\delta_{jk}), where \\\\lambda and \\\\mu are the Lam√© constants, and \\\\delta_{ij} is the Kronecker delta. The strain tensor itself can be defined to reflect distortion in any way that results in invariance under total rotation, but the most common definition which regard to which elastic tensors are usually expressed defines strain as the symmetric part of the gradient of displacement with all nonlinear terms suppressed: :\\\\varepsilon_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\partial_i u_j + \\\\partial_j u_i ) where u_i is the displacement at a point in the i^{th} direction and \\\\partial_j is the partial derivative in the j^{th} direction. Note that: : \\\\varepsilon_{jj} = \\\\partial_j u_j where no summation is intended. Although full Einstein notation sums over raised and lowered pairs of indices, the values of elastic and strain tensor components are usually expressed with all indices lowered. Thus beware (as here) that in some contexts a repeated index does not imply a sum overvalues of that index (j in this case), but merely a single component of a tensor.

One newspaper summed up that: \\"SHARE has brought help and hope, homes and happiness to the lonely old people who have been forgotten by society\\". The organisation was founded in 1970 by Brother Jerome Kelly and students of Presentation Brothers College, Cork, to deal with the social issues of the time. As it gathered momentum, other schools in Cork joined, and today students from 18 secondary schools collaborate in organising every aspect of the charity. Since its founding, over 200 custom-built homes have been provided by the organisation. Work by the members of SHARE is year-round, but its most active period is the Christmas Fast & Fundraising Campaign, when over 1800 students collect in Cork city centre. The charity's sole collection period lasts only ten days, which has made it a recognisable part of the Cork Christmas season. It has received recognition from the media, important Irish political figures, and the people of Cork; but it is the involvement of students from all of Cork city's secondary schools has made SHARE \\"a truly unique and effective organisation\\" in Ireland today.Lord Mayor of Cork Deirdre Clune; quoted in History In 1969, Brother Jerome Kelly returned home from missionary work and was made principal of Presentation Brothers College. He organised a series of workshops, in which the students of Presentation College were encouraged to think globally and act locally. The senior students were sent out to walk the lanes and side streets of Cork City and identify the major problems themselves. While the city centre's main thoroughfares were bustling with \\"elegant buildings and fashionable shop windows\\", there existed a different reality in the dreary alleys and decaying tenements. The students were \\"unanimous in their belief that the greatest single need was the plight of the elderly citizens‚Ä¶ apparently forgotten by their own people\\". The new Crib in Daunt Square, in 2006. In 1970, SHARE was founded when a group of 12 students erected a makeshift crib on St. Patrick's Street and fasted for thirty hours to attract attention to the plight of the elderly. At first they aimed to help the elderly by renovating the \\"depressing attic rooms and tiny basement flats,\\" until the uncaring landlords increased the rent. The students obtained the support of the civic leaders at the time for their project, getting \\"free land in key areas of the city,\\" and were then \\"faced with challenge of fundraising and ensuring homes for the elderly were built.\\" Through their work, they had sufficient funds by 1975 to begin building the first SHARE Complex. In 1976, twelve houses were built and furnished at Cloch√°n Barra on Sheare's Street and accommodation for thirteen people was provided at Grenville Place. Over the following two years, eleven homes were provided at Sheare's Street, seven houses at Sunday's Well, and 13 houses at Fair Street. The nineteen houses at Shandon were formally opened by the Taoiseach Jack Lynch. Following the securing of these new homes for the residents, the practice of regular visits was begun to deal with the problem of loneliness. The enthusiastic support of the people of Cork ensured the organisation's rapid development throughout the city, and the support of the students‚Äô parents led to the establishment of \\"SHARE Mothers.\\" SHARE celebrated its 10th anniversary in 1980, with the fifteen-house complex at Abbey Street opened by President of Ireland Patrick Hillery. Complexes were also opened at Dyke Parade and Ardfert, Great William O‚ÄôBrien Street. In 1988, President Hillery also opened a 32 house complex at Grattan Street. Organisation The Preslink Choir singing outside the Crib in Daunt Square, in 2006. Although originally made up solely of students of Presentation College, SHARE is currently organised by an elected Executive committee of 50-60, composed of students from the 18 secondary schools in Cork city. These students are typically fifth year or senior cycle students. Pres still maintains a strong presence on the committee, with the chairman elected from the school, in recognition of its role in founding the organisation. The organisation's sole collection period each year is the \\"Christmas Fast & Fundraising Campaign\\", which starts on 14 December and spans the 10-day run up to Christmas. During this time, the members of the Executive committee spend as much as ten hours collecting in the city centre each day, with the focal point of the collection at The Crib in Daunt's Square. Additionally, there is a separate Fasting Committee, which spends 24 hours fasting outside the crib at a time. The campaign is therefore linked with the Christian message of the Gospel and the significance and relevance of the Christmas Crib. There are also cribs in the city's main suburban shopping centres, in the Blackpool, Bishopstown Court, Douglas Court, Douglas Village, Mahon Point, Merchant's Quay and Wilton shopping centres. Overall, 1800 volunteer students also get involved in this collection, bearing the organisation's \\"trademark yellow collection boxes and enthusiastic smiles\\", regardless of the weather. SHARE always aims to have at least 100 collectors on the streets at any one time. While collection only occurs at Christmas, members of the SHARE Executive visit any resident of the housing schemes that desires visitation, on a regular basis. Although they are not obliged to continue to do this on a permanent basis (as the executive is changed each school year), many develop a strong bond of friendship and keep in touch for years after. Facilities The Brother Jerome Kelly Day Care Centre, on Sheare's Street. There are 167 SHARE housing units in total, located in clusters throughout Cork city: in Blackpool, Shandon Street, Sheare's Street, Grattan Street, Abbey Street, Blarney Street and Sunday's Well. These facilities are a mix of sheltered housing, apartments and small individual homes, each with \\"all the modern requirements\\" and fully furnished. Here the elderly enjoy \\"the freedom of their own comfortable space in a safe environment\\", and are provided with a range of practical services; including medical treatments, meals, laundry services and support networks as necessary. Additionally, there is the Day Care Centre at Sheare's Street, \\"a really homely centre for elderly people, with practical and fun activities.\\" Activities available include dance, arts and crafts, bingo, darts, quiz games, knitting, sewing, baking, card games, snooker and drama. Maintaining, managing and refurbishing these facilities requires continuous funding. As the Chairman of the 2007 Executive, Kevin Olden, announced: Recognition and media coverage Since the opening of the first SHARE homes in 1976, complexes have been opened by Taoiseach Jack Lynch, President Hillery, President Mary Robinson, then Minister for Health and Children Miche√°l Martin TD, and the various Lord Mayors of Cork. On the opening of the 100th SHARE house, President Hillery said: \\"SHARE's achievements demonstrate a generosity and dedication on the part of young people which is an inspiration and challenge to us all\\". In 2002, the SHARE Day Care Centre was visited by President Mary McAleese. Later, in 2006, President McAleese acknowledged the work \\"which changed bad lives into good.\\" Each year since Br. Jerome's death, the Br. Jerome Lecture has been held in his honour, on social issues and the involvement of SHARE in the community. Guest speakers in the past have included Miche√°l Martin, Pat Cox and Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. The Taoiseach described the SHARE project as \\"a model of active citizenship\\", \\"character building\\" and \\"satisfying and empowering\\": The work of SHARE has also received significant attention in both local, national and international media over the years. The British newspaper The Guardian described the project as \\"Imaginative, courageous and exciting\\", while Dick Cross of The Irish Independent labelled it as: \\"One of the most imaginative and practical projects ever undertaken in this country\\". Tom McSweeney of RT√â said the \\"exciting venture by Cork's youth has brought new life to the old city\\", and similarly Padraigh O'Morain of The Irish Times described it as \\"one of Ireland's great success stories\\". In 2005, it was further acclaimed as a demonstration of \\"the magnificent generosity of the Cork people\\". In 2007, the SHARE residents endorsed the organisation's 38th Christmas Fast & Fundraising Campaign.

In 1918, Jones became the first Executive Secretary of the NUL. The League, under his direction, significantly expanded its multifaceted campaign to crack the barriers to black employment, spurred first by the boom years of the 1920s, and then, by the desperate years of the Great Depression. He implemented boycotts against firms that refused to employ blacks, pressured schools to expand vocational opportunities for young people, constantly prodded Washington officials to include blacks in New Deal recovery programs, and a drive to get blacks into previously segregated labor unions. Together with Charles S. Johnson in 1923, he helped launch Opportunity a journal which addressed problems faced by blacks. In 1925, the National Conference of Social Work elected Jones treasurer, and he served the organization until 1933, rising to the position of Vice President. He was the first African American on its executive board. In 1933, Jones took a position with the Department of Commerce in Washington, DC as an advisor on Negro Affairs.

Background Blair was born in 1741 in Faggs Manor, near Cochranville, Chester County, Pennsylvania, the son of a Presbyterian minister also named Samuel Blair who died when the son was about ten years old. His mother was Frances van Hook, daughter of Judge Lawrence van Hook and Johanna (Smith) van Hook, who was the daughter of Hendrick Barents Smith of New York City. Education His primary education was at his father's theology school, the Faggs Manor Classical School. He went on to earn a B.A. in 1760 and a M.A. in 1764 from The College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), where he also tutored from 1761-1764. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Newcastle in 1764. He earned a M.A. from Harvard College in 1767 and a D.D. (Doctor of Divinity) from the University of Pennsylvania in 1790. Life A conscientious and eloquent minister, he became pastor of the Old South Church in Boston in 1766. While traveling to Boston, he survived a shipwreck but became ill and lost his possessions including the sermons he had written. In the spring of 1769, he traveled to Philadelphia and became severely ill, believing he would not recover. Because of his poor health, and conflict with his church members regarding the Half-Way Covenant, he resigned and was dismissed on October 10, 1769. He then moved to Germantown, Pennsylvania. During the revolutionary war, he was a chaplain of the Continental Army from 1775 until June 20, 1780. His rank as an officer made him eligible for membership in the Society of the Cincinnati. He was appointed the second Chaplain of Congress on December 10, 1790, a position he held for two years, until he was replaced by Ashbel Green on November 5, 1792. Blair was a member of the American Philosophical Society and died in Germantown in September 1818.

It is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade I, and is part of the East Hampshire Hangers Special Area of Conservation. It is managed by the National Trust. Topography The Common occupies the crown of Selborne Hill, an easterly guardian of the Hampshire Downs. The highest part has an elevation of above sea level. The southerly and westerly flanks slope away gently; on the other sides the contours are steeper. The steepest slope of all, with a maximum gradient of about 50%, overlooks the village and is called \\"Selborne Hanger\\". To the west of this is Coneycroft Hill, which in places is almost as precipitous. Between Selborne Hanger and Coneycroft Hill is a deep dell. Geology The soil on the Common consists of clay with flints, overlying the chalk of which the South Downs are made. The watercourses are underground and discharge into the Oakhanger Stream, flowing north-eastwards, and the Caker Stream, flowing northwards. Both ultimately join the River Wey. Flora The steepest slopes are clad in ancient beechwood (Fagus sylvatica): a \\"hanger\\", in East Hampshire, is just such a beechwood. The plateau is occupied by more beechwood, mixed with other broad- leaved species such as English oak (Quercus robur), ash (Fraxinus excelsior) and hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna), and in places is scrubby. A small part of the plateau comprises open grassland with scattered gorse (Ulex europaeus) and stands of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum). Other, smaller areas of chalk grassland have recently been recreated elsewhere. The Common is noted for its wild flowers, with thriving communities of yellow archangel (Galeobdolon luteum), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa). Spurge-laurel (Daphne laureola) is sparsely but widely distributed. The Common is also home to such interesting species as stinking hellebore (Helleborus foetidus), green hellebore (H. viridis ssp. occidentalis), bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), violet helleborine (Epipactis purpurata), the extreme rarity E. x schulzei (first British record here, 1931), and green- flowered helleborine (E. phyllanthes). Fauna Various rare molluscs and insects have been recorded. Butterflies on the Common include the Duke of Burgundy (Hamearis lucina), silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia) and purple emperor (Apatura iris). The avifauna includes most of the species typical of broad-leaved woodland in southern England, such as sparrowhawk (Accipter nisus), stock dove (Columba oenas), tawny owl (Strix aluco), European green woodpecker (Picus viridis), great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major), garden warbler (Sylvia borin), blackcap (S. atricapilla), chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita), spotted flycatcher (Muscicapa striata), marsh tit (Parus palustris), nuthatch (Sitta europaea), treecreeper Certhia familiaris and jay (Garrulus glandarius). Buzzards (Buteo buteo) regularly hunt over the tree canopy. Hobby (Falco subbuteo), woodcock (Scolopax rusticola), common firecrest (Regulus ignicapillus) and brambling (Fringilla montifringilla) are occasional visitors. Selborne Common is a reliable place to find the wood warbler (Phylloscopus sibilatrix). Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) are resident mammals. History and management From the prehistoric or Romano-British period there is evidence of a field system, which may have been re-used during the Middle Ages. The Common has not been ploughed since then. Earthworks on the western boundary have tentatively been dated to the mid thirteenth century, when Newton Park was emparked. An earth bank, running across the Common, has been dated to around 1750 and was probably used to protect coppice woodland from grazing animals. During the eighteenth century, the lord of the manor felled beeches on the Common. Local people exercised their common rights to graze cattle and sheep and to collect firewood, activities which continued into the 1950s. In mediaeval times the nearby Selborne Priory was lord of the manor of Selborne; the manor subsequently passed to Magdalen College, Oxford, which donated it to the National Trust in 1932. Cattle have recently been reintroduced in an attempt to reconstruct the ancient, flower-rich, wood- pasture habitat which commoning produced and which has almost disappeared from England. A dew pond, Wood Pond, is situated near the western boundary. Gilbert White Selborne Common is internationally famous for its association with the eighteenth-century naturalist, Gilbert White. Access The Common is freely accessible to all, subject to the National Trust's byelaws. It is best approached from Selborne, via the (steep) Zig-Zag or Bostal paths (car park behind the Selborne Arms public house, Ordnance Survey reference ). A more level track leads to the Common from Newton Valence; footpaths join it also from the south-east and north-west. After rain and especially in winter, some paths can become very muddy. Selborne Common is on the Hangers Way. References Bibliography *Brewis, Anne, et al. (1996) The Flora of Hampshire.

The British retrieved some supplies and destroyed others, as well as destroying some residences and other buildings. Learning that Count Casimir Pulaski was on the way, the British quickly left by ship the following day. They had an encounter with Pulaski's forces a week later and caused heavy losses. Background At the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, Chestnut Neck was a busy thriving trade center on the Little Egg Harbor River near the New Jersey coast, about north of present-day Atlantic City, New Jersey. Local vessels traveled to New York and elsewhere, carrying mail, trading goods and merchandise. With the coming of the war, American privateers took over the harbor facilities to use as a home base. They would attack and seize British ships and take their captured prizes into Chestnut Neck. The captured vessels and their cargoes were sold, and the captured vessels were often adapted for use as privateers. In addition, French aid to the Patriots may have come in through Chestnut Neck as well - supplies, ammunition, uniforms, and the like. With the British holding Philadelphia and New York City during the winter of 1777-78, General George Washington at Valley Forge was cut off from his sources of supplies. Supplies were brought into Little Egg Harbor, unloaded at Chestnut Neck, taken up the river in flat-bottomed boats to the Forks, carted across the peninsula to Burlington, across the Delaware River, and transported overland to Valley Forge. Many British cargoes intended for Sir Henry Clinton in New York were seized by American privateers and reached General Washington via Chestnut Neck and the described route. General Clinton became so exasperated by this constant loss of his ships, that he decided to \\"clean out that nest of Rebel Pirates.\\" Accordingly, on September 30, 1778, a fleet of nine British ships and transports, under the command of Captain Henry Collins, with 300 British regulars and 100 New Jersey Loyalists, under Captain Patrick Ferguson, sailed from New York, bound for Chestnut Neck. Governor William Livingston learned of their sailing, and sent riders to warn the people. General Washington dispatched Count Kazimierz Pu≈Çaski and his Legion to assist the Patriots, although they did not arrive until the day following the battle. Battle Because of bad weather, the British fleet did not arrive off Little Egg Harbor until late in the afternoon of October 5, 1778, and were prevented from getting over the bar. Knowing the people had been warned and that Count Pu≈Çaski was on his way, the British troops made their way up the river to Chestnut Neck as quickly as possible. The troops were put aboard the galleys and armed boats and left at daybreak on October 6, 1778. They were delayed when two boats grounded, and did not reach Chestnut Neck until four o'clock, in heavy fog. They fought against American defenders and retrieved some supplies. Having destroyed any supplies that they could not retrieve, and having received intelligence that Count Pu≈Çaski was on his way, they quickly left at noon on October 7, 1778, stopping at the mouth of the Bass River to destroy the salt works and mills of Eli Mathis. They also burnt the houses on his plantation, his home and barns and then rejoined their ships. Aftermath As soon as Count Pu≈Çaski arrived at Chestnut Neck, he crossed the river and marched to Tuckerton, arriving there on October 8, 1778. Pu≈Çaski (with 50 troops) and the British (with 200) watched each other until October 15, 1778. That day the British surprised an outpost of Pu≈Çaski's men, bayonetting the sentry and almost all of the other men while still sleeping. The British withdrew and sailed back to New York. Americans call this the \\"Little Egg Harbor massacre.\\" The site is marked by a monument erected by the Sons of the Cincinnati. Although they retrieved some supplies and destroyed others at Chestnut Neck, the British and American Loyalists were not able to capture any of the American privateers or recapture any of the prize vessels present in the area. After the battle, Chestnut Neck never regained its status as a trade center. Three of the large land owners returned and rebuilt their homes, but the others eventually built new homes in present-day Port Republic. Legacy Monument commemorating the battle in Port Republic. In the early twentieth century, the General Lafayette Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution erected a high monument to mark the site of the Battle of Chestnut Neck and honor the men that fought there.

In the beginning it was a holding company for \\"Loftlei√∞ir\\" and Air Iceland under the name Flugleidir, a hybrid of the two old names. In 1978 Flugleidir took over all assets of both companies. Until then \\"Loftleidir\\" had used \\"Loftleidir Icelandic\\", \\"Icelandic Airlines\\" or just \\"Icelandic\\" for international marketing and Air Iceland used \\"Icelandair\\". That same year the name \\"Icelandair\\" was to be used solely for international marketing. Fluglei√∞ir was still the official name of the company until 2005. Icelandair Boeing 757-200In December 2002 Baugur Group acquired 20% of the company.Kaupthing Bank sells stake in Stodir to Baugur Group hf in ISK1.4bn deal Nordic Business Report, Dec 5, 2002 Baugur Group was reportedly controlled by a number of companies in a single mailbox in British Virgin Islands.Logo of FL Group before the name change = 2005 change = In 2005, the company known as Fluglei√∞ir was changed to an investment company called FL GROUP. The airline had been spun off into a subsidiary named Icelandair in 2002. On October 23, 2005 FL GROUP announced its acquisition of the Danish low-cost airline Sterling Airways. In addition, FL GROUP holds a 16.18% stake in British \\"no-frills\\" carrier easyJet. On January 6, 2006, Hannes Sm√°rason, CEO, stated that a merger of easyJet and Sterling was a possibility. = 2006-2007 = In early 2006 Fer√∞askrifstofa √çslands was sold to Sumarfer√∞ir and Icelandair Car Rental (Hertz) was sold to Magn√∫s Kristinsson, the owner of Toyota in Iceland. In February 2006 FL GROUP announced plans to list its subsidiary Icelandair Group in Iceland Stock Exchange. FL sold its 16.9% stake in British no-frills airline easyJet in April 2006 for ‚Ç¨325m, returning a profit of ‚Ç¨140m on its investment. FL had first invested in easyJet in October 2004, taking an 8.4% share, increasing this over the course of 2005. In October 2006 FL GROUP secured the sale of Icelandair Group. In 2007, the FL Group invested $50 million in several Bayrock projects linked to Donald Trump, including a development in Whitestone, Queens, and Trump SoHo in Manhattan. =2008 revamp= In February 2008, after the US real-estate bubble had burst, FL Group announced it was divesting itself of its real-estate projects in the US. The Trump Tower project, along with other US based real estate projects, were moved to a subsidiary of FL Group called FL Bayrock Holdco. In March, stakes in Finnair and investment group Aktiv Kapital were divested; in April a 39% stake in FL was acquired by Styrkur Invest, a company controlled by FL's Chairman J√≥n √Åsgeir J√≥hannesson. The company then delisted from the Iceland Stock Exchange on 6 June after a share buyback. J√≥n √Åsgeir stepped down as Chairman later that month after a conviction for breaking accounting laws. His wife Ingibjorg Stefania Palmadottir was elected as his replacement. On July 4, FL Group announced both that it had changed its name to Stodir and acquired a 39% stake in retail holding company Baugur Group. = Insolvency 2008 = In September 2008 it was announced that Stodir had filed an application for a debt moratorium process at the District Court of Reykjav√≠k, effectively putting the company into administration. The move was prompted by the Government of Iceland's acquisition of three-quarters of troubled bank Glitnir, in which Stodir had previously held a 32% stake. For 2008, FL Bayrock Holdco posted more than 140 million USD in losses. It was declared bankrupt in January 2014, costing its sole investor and creditor, the parent FL Group, nearly 130 million USD in losses. = 2009-2016 = Composition agreement reached with creditors (June 2009), which thereby acquired all shares in the renamed company Stodir. Between 2009 and 2016, all assets were sold except for a shareholding in Refresco Holding, a pan European beverage company, all debt was paid off, and all legal issues resolved. = 2017 = S121 ehf.

Childhood and early life Roy P. Benavidez was born in Lindenau near Cuero, Texas in DeWitt County. He is a descendant of the founders of Benavides, Texas and was the son of a Mexican farmer, Salvador Benavidez, Jr. and a Yaqui Indian mother, Teresa Perez. When he was two years old, his father died of tuberculosis and his mother remarried. Five years later, his mother died from tuberculosis as well. Benavidez and his younger brother Roger moved to El Campo, where their grandfather, uncle and aunt raised them along with eight cousins. Benavidez shined shoes at the local bus station, labored on farms in California and Washington, and worked at a tire shop in El Campo. He attended school sporadically, and at age 15 he dropped out to work full-time to help support the family. Military career =US Army= Benavidez enlisted in the Texas Army National Guard in 1952 during the Korean War. In June 1955, he switched from the Army National Guard to Army active duty. In 1959, he married Hilaria Coy Benavidez, completed Airborne training, and was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. =Army Special Forces= Benavidez returned to Fort Bragg and began training for the elite Army Special Forces. Once qualified and accepted, he became a member of the 5th Special Forces Group; and the Studies and Observations Group (SOG). Vietnam In 1965 he was sent to South Vietnam as an advisor to an Army of the Republic of Vietnam infantry regiment. He stepped on a land mine It is alternatively reported that it may have been a grenade thrown at the back of him. during a patrol and was evacuated to the United States. Doctors at Fort Sam Houston concluded he would never walk again and began preparing his medical discharge papers. As Benavidez noted in his 1981 MOH acceptance speech, stung by the diagnosis, as well as flag burnings and media criticism of the US military presence in Vietnam he saw on TV, he began an unsanctioned nightly training ritual in an attempt to redevelop his ability to walk.. Getting out of bed at night (against doctors' orders), Benavidez would crawl using his elbows and chin to a wall near his bedside and (with the encouragement of his fellow patients, many of whom were permanently paralyzed and/or missing limbs), he would prop himself against the wall and attempt to lift himself unaided, starting by wiggling his toes, then his feet, and then eventually (after several months of excruciating practice that by his own admission often left him in tears) pushing himself up the wall with his ankles and legs.. After over a year of hospitalization, Benavidez walked out of the hospital in July 1966, with his wife at his side, determined to return to combat in Vietnam. Despite continuing pain from his wounds, he returned to South Vietnam in January 1968. 6 Hours in Hell On May 2, 1968, a 12-man Special Forces patrol, which included nine Montagnard tribesmen, was surrounded by a NVA infantry battalion of about 1,000 men. Benavidez heard the radio appeal for help and boarded a helicopter to respond. Armed only with a knife, he jumped from the helicopter carrying his medical bag and ran to help the trapped patrol. Benavidez \\"distinguished himself by a series of daring and extremely valorous actions... and because of his gallant choice to join voluntarily his comrades who were in critical straits, to expose himself constantly to withering enemy fire, and his refusal to be stopped despite numerous severe wounds, saved the lives of at least eight men.\\" Farinacci, Donald J. Last Full Measure of Devotion: A Tribute to America's Heroes of the Vietnam War. Bloomington, IN: AuthorHouse, 2007. / . At one point in the battle an NVA soldier accosted him and stabbed him with his bayonet. Benavidez pulled it out, yanked out his own knife, killed him and kept going, leaving his knife in the NVA soldier's body. After the battle, he was evacuated to the base camp, examined, and thought to be dead. As he was placed in a body bag among the other dead in body bags, he was suddenly recognized by a friend who called for help. A doctor came and examined him but believed Benavidez was dead. The doctor was about to zip up the body bag when Benavidez managed to spit in his face, alerting the doctor that he was alive. Roman Catholic Saints, Roy Benavidez(see medal citation below) Benavidez had a total of 37 separate bullet, bayonet, and shrapnel wounds from the six-hour fight with the enemy battalion. Benavidez was evacuated once again to Fort Sam Houston's Brooke Army Medical Center, where he eventually recovered. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism and four Purple Hearts. In 1969, he was assigned to Fort Riley, Kansas. In 1972, he was assigned to Fort Sam Houston, Texas where he remained until retirement. Medal of Honor Army Master Sgt. Roy P. Benavidez (center) is flanked by United States Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger (left) and President Ronald Reagan at his Medal of Honor presentation ceremony in 1981. In 1973, after more detailed accounts became available, Special Forces Lieutenant Colonel Ralph R. Drake insisted that Benavidez receive the Medal of Honor. By then, however, the time limit on the medal had expired. An appeal to Congress resulted in an exemption for Benavidez, but the Army Decorations Board denied him an upgrade of his Distinguished Service Cross to the Medal of Honor. The Army board required an eyewitness account from someone present during the action. Benavidez believed that there were no living witnesses of the \\"Six Hours in Hell.\\" Unbeknownst to Benavidez, there was a living witness, who would later provide the eyewitness account necessary: Brian O'Connor, the former radioman of Benavidez's Special Forces team in Vietnam. O'Connor had been severely wounded (Benavidez had believed him dead), and he was evacuated to the United States before his superiors could fully debrief him. O'Connor had been living in the Fiji Islands when, in 1980, he was on holiday in Australia. During his holiday O'Connor read a newspaper account of Benavidez from an El Campo newspaper, which had been picked up by the international press and reprinted in Australia. O'Connor immediately contacted Benavidez and submitted a ten-page report of the encounter, confirming the accounts provided by others, and serving as the necessary eyewitness. Benavidez's Distinguished Service Cross accordingly was upgraded to the Medal of Honor. On February 24, 1981, President Ronald Reagan presented Roy P. Benavidez with the Medal of Honor. Reagan turned to the press and said, \\"If the story of his heroism were a movie script, you would not believe it\\". He then read the official award citation. Post-military retirement In 1976, Benavidez, his wife, and their three children returned home to El Campo, Texas. He devoted his remaining years to the youth of America, speaking to them about the importance of staying in school and getting an education. His message was simple: \\"An education is the key to success. Bad habits and bad company will ruin you.\\" In 1983, Benavidez told the press that the Social Security Administration planned to cut off disability payments he had been receiving since his retirement, as well as the disability payments for thousands of other veterans. He went to Capitol Hill and pleaded with the House Select Committee on Aging to abandon their plans, which they finally did. ; Speaker Benavidez was in demand as a speaker by United States armed forces, schools, military and civic groups, and private businesses. He also spoke in Greece, Panama, Korea, and Japan, where he visited American military personnel and even joined them on field exercises. He received complimentary letters from students, service members, and private citizens throughout the world. ; Author He wrote three autobiographical books about his life and military experience. In 1986, he published The Three Wars of Roy Benavidez, which described his struggles growing up as a poor Mexican- American orphan, his military training and combat in Vietnam, and the efforts by others to get recognition for his actions in Vietnam.Roy Benavidez with Oscar Griffin, The Three Wars of Roy Benavidez New York: Ballantine, 1986. Benavidez later wrote The Last Medal of Honor (Texas: Swan Publishers, 1991) with Pete Billac and Medal of Honor: A Vietnam Warrior's Story in 1995.Roy Benevidez with John R. Craig, Medal of Honor: One Man's Journey From Poverty and Prejudice, Washington, DC: Potomac Books, 1995.

(Saul's Hill); ) is a neighborhood in western Jerusalem, Israel. The neighborhood is located at the western entrance to the city, east of the neighborhood of Har Nof and north of Kiryat Moshe. Givat Shaul stands 820 meters above sea level. Name Givat Shaul is named after the Rishon Lezion, Rabbi Yaakov Shaul Elyashar, the Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel, and not, as commonly believed, for the biblical King Saul, whose capital was probably located on the hill Gibeah of Saul near Pisgat Ze'ev, on the way to Ramallah.Yarok Birushalayim, Shechunat Givat Shaul, Society for the Protection of Nature in Israel, Vol. 85, June‚ÄìJuly 2007. History Givat Shaul was established in 1906 on land purchased from the Arab villages of Deir Yassin and Lifta by a society headed by Rabbi Nissim Elyashar, Arieh Leib and Moshe Kopel Kantrovitz. Difficulties in registering the land delayed construction until 1919. The first residents were needy families who were given small plots to grow fresh produce that was marketed in Jerusalem.Jerusalem neighborhoods: Givat Shaul These families, mainly Yemenite Jews, were joined by others from Meah Shearim and the Old City. The Ashkenazim built the first public building, Beit Knesset HaPerushim. In 1912, an embroidery and sewing workshop was opened with the help of a Jewish philanthropist, Rabbi Slutzkin. Other industries established in Givat Shaul were the Froumine biscuit factory, a factory for kerosene heaters that manufactured arms for the British army during the British Mandate of Palestine, and a matza factory. In 1927, the Diskin Orphanage moved to Givat Shaul from the Old City. This building, designed by a local architect named Tabachnik, was home to 500 orphan boys. According to a census conducted in 1931 by the British Mandate authorities, Givat Shaul had a population of 966 inhabitants, in 152 inhabited houses.Mills, 1932, p. 39 Kfar Shaul Mental Health Center A long, dirt track separated Givat Shaul from a cluster of Arab villages, including Deir Yassin, with whom the Jews maintained good relations. In late 1946, the Haganah straightened and paved the dirt track in order to use it as a landing strip. During the Battle for Jerusalem in 1948, the Haganah flew in supplies, armaments, food, and troops on this runway. After the war, this road became known as Kanfei Nesharim Street. In January 1948, the leaders of Givat Shaul met with the mukhtar of Deir Yassin to work out a non-aggression pact: if armed militia entered Deir Yassin, the villagers would hang out laundry in a certain sequence or place lanterns in a particular location. In return, patrols from Givat Shaul guaranteed safe passage to Deir Yassin residents, in vehicles or on foot, passing through their neighborhood on the way to Jerusalem.Morris 2004, p. 91; Gelber 2006, p. 308. Over time, Deir Yassin became a halfway site for Arab forces moving from Ein Karem and Malha to al-Qastal and Kolonia, which overlooked the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway. On 9 April 1948, Deir Yassin was attacked by Irgun and Lehi forcesLevitza's account, from ‚ÄòNine Measures‚Äô by Yitzhak Levi (\\"Levitza\\") published by ‚ÄòMaarachot‚Äô Israel Defense Forces Press, Tel Aviv, 1986 and between 100 and 110 villagers were killed during the fights or massacred afterward. The population that had not fled was expelled. The rumours about this massacre also contributed to the trigger of the 1948 Palestinian exodus.Gelber 2006 In 1951, the abandoned buildings were used to house a therapeutic community of 300 patients called the Kfar Shaul Government Work Village for Mental Patients.Progress in Psychotherapy, American Psychiatric Association, Grune & Stratton, 1949. The majority of patients were Holocaust survivors.Freidman, Ron. \\"Challenged children get a bird's-eye view of Masada\\", The Jerusalem Post, 17 June 2006. Industrial development Partial view of Angel Bakeries' flour pipeline, which conveys flour directly from the flour mill to the silos (left) to the bakery (right), spanning Beit Hadfus Street in Givat Shaul. After 1948, the Givat Shaul industrial zone expanded with factories and warehouses. Angel's Bakery moved to its present location here in 1958. The Angel brothers and co-CEOs Avraham, Ovadia, and Danny, commissioned a Texas company to construct a 750-foot pipeline to convey flour directly from the mill to the silo to the bakery. Today this pipeline brings 120 tons of flour to the bakery daily. The invention, initially opposed by the Jerusalem municipality for being above-ground, won the Kaplan Prize for distinction in productivity and efficiency. The bakery's landmark factory store opened in 1984. Berman's Bakery, founded in 1875 by Mrs. Kreshe Berman as a cottage industry in the Old City, moved to its present location down the road from Angel's in 1965. A new street, Beit Hadfus Street, was constructed to reach the new bakery. This new street was named \\"Street of the Printing Press\\" for the many printing establishments also located here. These include two large book publishing houses, Keter Publishing House (established in 1958) and Feldheim Publishers, which established its Israel branch in the 1960s. Old City Press has operated here since 1969. Since the late 1980s, aging industrial plants have been replaced by housing projects in Givat Shaul Bet. Demography The population consists of a mix of Haredi and Religious Zionist Jews. The northernmost part of the neighborhood, directly above Highway 1, is mostly Haredi, while residents of the southern part, bordering Kiryat Moshe, are mostly Modern Orthodox Religious Zionists. Neighborhoods =Northern Givat Shaul= The northern part of Givat Shaul is populated mainly by Haredim, and the main street is closed to traffic on Shabbat and Jewish holidays. Several major synagogues are located here, including the Pressburg Yeshiva and neighborhood synagogue, and the Zupnik - Ner Yisroel synagogue, and the ivy Yeshiva, Ner Moshe, headed by Rabbi Avraham Gurewitz and Rabbi Shalom Shechter. The population consists of a mix of Hasidic, Litvishe and Sephardi/Mizrahi Haredim, and a small minority of National- Religious Jews. The rabbi of the Zupnik - Ner Yisroel synagogue is Avrohom Yitzchok Ulman, a senior member of the rabbinical high court, or Badatz, of the Edah HaChareidis. Other important rabbis living in Givat Shaul are Rabbi Yehoshua Karlinsky, rabbi of the Beer Avrohom synagogue; Rabbi Tennenbaum, rabbi of the Babad synagogue and Rabbi Shmuel Taussig, Admor of Toldos Shmuel. =Southern Givat Shaul= In the southern part of Givat Shaul, the population predominantly consists of Modern Orthodox Jews, affiliating with Religious Zionism. This section borders Kiryat Moshe and is often also referred to as such. Institutions in this area include the main synagogue of Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu, a major center of Sephardic Religious Zionism, as well as the primarily Ashkenazi national-religious flagship Mercaz HaRav yeshiva. Israel Central Bureau of Statistics at the western end of Givat Shaul Bet. =Givat Shaul Bet= Berman bakery The Givat Shaul industrial zone, sometimes referred to as Givat Shaul Bet, is situated on two parallel streets, Kanfei Nesharim and Beit Hadfus. While Kanfei Nesharim Street has developed into a modern shopping area with many chain stores and stylish office buildings, Beit Hadfus Street remains largely industrial with discount stores and outlets that attract bargain shoppers. In recent years, low-cost wedding halls servicing the religious population of Jerusalem have opened in several office and industrial buildings on Beit Hadfus Street. Some of these are subsidized by major charity organizations to keep expenses down for low-income families. The Armonot Wolf (Wolf Palaces) wedding halls are affiliated with the Yad Eliezer charity organization, which subsidizes weddings for orphans here through its Adopt-a-Wedding campaign. The Gutnick Halls, funded by Australian philanthropist Joseph Gutnick and managed by Chabad, provide subsidized weddings for 440 needy couples annually through the Colel Chabad charity fund. The Lechaim halls, located into the same industrial complex as Armonot Wolf, are also cheaper than wedding halls in other parts of the city. Government offices include the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the National Authority of Religious Services, the State Comptroller and Ombudsman, the Israel Securities Authority, the Income Tax Commission, the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, and the National Parks Authority. The Israeli branch of Touro College and the Tal Institute, the women's division of the Jerusalem College of Technology, are also located in Givat Shaul. Givat Shaul cemetery Har HaMenuchot cemetery On the northwestern ridge of the neighborhood lies Har HaMenuchot, Jerusalem's largest cemetery. Between the northern section of Givat Shaul and the cemetery is another commercial zone consisting of several large stores and office buildings. The Herzog psychiatric hospital, Egged's bus maintenance facility, and the main depot for the Jerusalem municipality's sanitation services are also located here.

Hand surgery may be practiced by graduates of general surgery, orthopedic surgery and plastic surgery. Chiroplasty, or cheiroplasty, is plastic surgery of the hands. Plastic surgeons and orthopedic surgeons receive significant training in hand surgery during their residency training. Also, some graduates do an additional one-year hand fellowship. Board certified general, plastic, or orthopedics surgeons who have completed approved fellowship training in hand surgery and have met a number of other practice requirements are qualified to take the \\"Certificate of Added Qualifications in Surgery of the Hand\\" examination, formerly known as the CAQSH, it is now known as the SOTH.\\"\\"Certificate of Added Qualifications in Surgery of the Hand\\" The American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery. Retrieved on 2008-11-20. Regardless of their original field of training, once candidates have completed an approved fellowship in hand surgery, all hand surgeons have received training in treating all injuries both to the bones and soft tissues of the hand and upper extremity. Among those without additional hand training, plastic surgeons have usually received training to handle traumatic hand and digit amputations that require a \\"replant\\" operation. Orthopedic surgeons are trained to reconstruct all aspects to salvage the appendage: tendons, muscle, bone. As well, orthopedic surgeons are trained to handle complex fractures of the hand and injuries to the carpal bones that alter the mechanics of the wrist. History The historical context for the three qualifying fields is that both plastic surgery and orthopedic surgery are more recent branches off the general surgery main trunk. Modern hand surgery began in World War II as a military planning decision. US Army Surgeon General, Major General Norman T. Kirk, knew that hand injuries in World War I had poor outcomes in part because there was no formal system to deal with them.American Society for Surgery of the Hand. (1995). The First Fifty Years. \\"The Second World War to 1971: The Founding,\\" pp. 1-17. New York: Churchill Livingstone Inc. Kirk also knew that his civilian general surgical colleague Dr. Sterling Bunnell had a special interest and experience in hand reconstruction. Kirk tapped Bunnell to train military surgeons in the management of hand injuries to treat the war casualties, and at that time hand surgery became a formal specialty. Orthopedic surgeons continued to develop special techniques to manage small bones, as found in the wrist and hand.Terminology for hand surgery. International Federation of Societies for Surgery of Hand, Harcourt Health Sciences, 2001. Pioneering plastic surgeons developed microsurgical techniques for repairing the small nerves and arteries of the hand. Surgeons from all three specialties have contributed to the development of techniques for repairing tendons and managing a broad range of acute and chronic hand injuries. Hand surgery incorporates techniques from orthopaedics, plastic surgery, general surgery, neurosurgery, vascular and microvascular surgery and psychiatry. A recent advance is the progression to 'wide awake hand surgery.'Lalonde DH. Reconstruction of the hand with wide awake surgery. Clin Plast Surg. 2011 Oct;38(4):761-9. doi: 10.1016/j.cps.2011.07.005. In a few countries such as Sweden, Finland and Singapore, hand surgery is recognized as a clinical specialty in its own right, with a formal four to six years hand surgery resident training program. Hand surgeons going through these programs are trained in all aspects of hand surgery, combining and mastering all the skills traditionally associated with \\"Orthopedic hand surgeons\\" and \\"Plastic hand surgeons\\" to become equally adept at handling tendon, ligament and bone injuries as well as microsurgical reconstruction such as reattachment of severed parts or free tissue transfers and transplants. Scope of Field Hand surgeons perform a wide variety of operations such as fracture repairs, releases, transfer and repairs of tendons and reconstruction of injuries, rheumatoid deformities and congenital defects. They also perform microsurgical reattachment of amputated digits and limbs, microsurgical reconstruction of soft tissues and bone, nerve reconstruction, and surgery to improve function in paralysed upper limbs. There are two medical societies that exist in the United States to provide continuing medical education to hand surgeons: the American Society for Surgery of the Hand and the American Association for Hand Surgery. In Britain, the medical society for hand surgeons is the: British Society for Surgery of the Hand (BSSH). In Europe, several societies are brought together by the Federation of European Societies for Surgery of the Hand (FESSH). Research activity among European hand surgery residents.

He played for twelve seasons on the Cleveland Indians (1953‚Äì57, 1964), Chicago White Sox (1958‚Äì62), Baltimore Orioles (1963) and Boston Red Sox (1964). In 2003, he was selected as one of the \\"100 Greatest Indians\\". Smith was an All-Star for two seasons. In 1955, he batted .306 and led the American League (AL) in four categories: 154 games played, 725 plate appearances, 294 times on base, and 123 runs scored. In 1993, Smith was enshrined in the Greater Akron Baseball Hall of Fame of Ohio. Early years Smith, nicknamed \\"Fuzzy\\" by his friends as a teenager when he was the first of them to sprout a beard, was born in Kirkwood, Missouri, and attended Douglass High School in Webster Groves. As a high school star in St. Louis, Smith scored ten touchdowns in a school football game and was a Golden Gloves boxing champion. Baseball career Smith posted a lifetime .272 batting average with 1,458 hits, 167 home runs, 676 RBIs, and also had a .959 fielding average. A good, selective hitter, he compiled a .407 on-base percentage in 1955, his best season. He played six different positions during his 12-year career. Smith started his professional baseball career in the Negro leagues in 1947 with the Cleveland Buckeyes. He joined the Cleveland Indians in 1949, and began his major league career with Cleveland in 1953. Smith was an outstanding defensive left fielder, he earned two AL All-Star selections in 1955 and 1960 (two All-Star Games were played). He is best remembered as the focal point of one of the most famous baseball photographs (see White Sox, below) =Cleveland Indians= An everyday player in 1954, Smith was a member of the Indians team that won a then-American League record 111 games. Batting from the leadoff spot, he responded with a .281 average, 101 runs, 186 hits, 11 home runs and 59 RBIs. He led off the World Series against the New York Giants with a home run. In 1955, he hit .306 with 22 home runs and 77 RBIs. =Chicago White Sox= In December 1957, Smith was traded by Cleveland along with Early Wynn to the Chicago White Sox for Minnie Mi√±oso and Fred Hatfield, in a deal that was very unpopular among Chicago fans (Mi√±oso was \\"their guy\\"). He slumped in his first year with the White Sox to the point that eccentric owner Bill Veeck held an \\"Al Smith Night\\" to honor his outfielder. Anyone named Smith, Smythe, Schmidt, or Smithe was admitted free and given a button that said, \\"I'm a Smith and I'm for Al.\\" On his big night, Smith went one-for-four, hitting into two easy outs with runners in scoring position, and dropped a fly ball that led to the Boston Red Sox's winning run. (Comiskey Park, August 26, 1959). Gora's famous photograph of Smith Smith would contribute enough to help his team win the American League pennant, its first in 40 years, en route to the 1959 World Series. It was during this series that Smith would enter baseball journalism history. In Game Two at Comiskey Park, Smith retreated to the left field wall in pursuit of a long drive hit by Charlie Neal of the Los Angeles Dodgers. As Smith watched the ball sail into the third row seats for a home run, a fan (Melvin Piehl, an executive for a motor-oil company) seated in the first row trying to catch the ball, accidentally tipped over his cup of beer, dousing Smith's head and face. Smith estimated that he signed photographs depicting that moment at least 200,000 times, and without making a cent on it. The photograph was taken by AP Chicago Tribune staff photographer John Raymond Gora, who died in 2003. In 1960, Smith won the respect of the fans by hitting a career-high .315 and making the league All-Star team. In 1961, he slugged a career-high 28 home runs, and led the White Sox in home runs that season. In 1962, he hit .292, and again led the White Sox with 16 home runs. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles at age 35. =Final seasons= Smith was sent to the Baltimore Orioles before the 1963 season with Luis Aparicio in the same transaction that brought Hoyt Wilhelm, Dave Nicholson, Pete Ward and Ron Hansen to the White Sox. His last major league season was in 1964, when he divided his playing time between the Cleveland Indians and the Boston Red Sox. =Major league highlights= All-Star (1955 and 1960) Lifetime batting average (.272) American League leader in games played (1955, 154) American League leader in runs scored (1955, 123) American League leader in times on base (1955, 294) American league leader in plate appearances (1955, 725) American League Pennant winner (1959, Chicago White Sox) Lifetime fielding average (.959) Post-playing career Following his baseball career, Smith became manager of the Chicago park district's baseball program, from 1966 through 1981. He also was the supervisor of recreation for Ogden Park, Illinois and worked part-time as a community relations representative for the White Sox. Smith died in 2002, at the age of 73 in Hammond, Indiana. In his 2010 Gold Mine, Bill James compared Smith to contemporary player Melvin Mora, and wondered if Smith was still well known enough to warrant an English Wikipedia page.

First published in serialized form in L‚Äô√âcho de Paris from 1891 to 1892, Mirbeau‚Äôs novel was reworked and polished before appearing in the Dreyfusard journal La Revue Blanche in 1900.  Plot  The novel presents itself as the diary of Mademoiselle C√©lestine R., a chambermaid. Her first employer fetishizes her boots, and she later discovers the elderly man dead, with one of her boots stuffed into his mouth. Later on, C√©lestine becomes the maid of an upper class couple, Lanlaire, and is perfectly aware that she is entangled in the power struggles of their marriage. C√©lestine ends by becoming a caf√© hostess, who mistreats her servants in turn.  Commentary  C√©lestine, by Octave Mirbeau. As a libertarian writer, Octave Mirbeau gives voice to a maidservant, C√©lestine: that is already subversive in itself. Through her eyes, which perceive the world through keyholes, he shows us the foul-smelling hidden sides of high society, the ‚Äòmoral bumps‚Äô of the dominating classes, and the turpitudes of the bourgeois society that he assails. Mirbeau‚Äôs story undresses the members of high society of their superficial probity, revealing them in the undergarments of their moral flaws: their hypocrisy and perversions.Cf.

Situated 740 ft above sea level. The civil parish of Wessington is, along with Shirland and Higham, the most southerly parish in the district. It stands on the west side of the Amber Valley on the Alfreton to Matlock Road. The settlement is centered on a large village green, a fish and chip shop and an old pub, \\"The Horse and Jockey\\". History When the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086, the village was known as Wistanestune, which may have been derived from the Anglo-Saxon words for 'water' and 'town', meaning \\"wet place\\". The village was then called Washington before acquiring its present name. The parish was separated from Crich in 1859.http://www.crichparish.co.uk/indexwebpages/wessington.html At the time, the village had a fairly large stocking frame knitting industry, with the majority of the inhabitants being employed in it.The National Gazetteer of Great Britain and Ireland, 1868, Genuki, accessed February 2009] Economy Businesses in Wessington include a fish and chip shop and a public house (the Horse and Jockey).

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 30, 1995.. In the episode, Bart is hospitalized after eating a piece of jagged metal in his Krusty-O's cereal and sues Krusty the Clown. While visiting Bart, Lisa discovers her old mentor, jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy, is also in the hospital. When he dies suddenly, she resolves to honor his memory. Steve Allen (as himself) and Ron Taylor (as Bleeding Gums Murphy) guest star, each in their second appearance on the show. Dan Higgins also returns as the writer and performer of all of Lisa and Bleeding Gums' saxophone solos. The episode was written by Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia -- based on a story idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss -- and was the first episode directed by Steven Dean Moore. Jean and Reiss, who were previously the series' showrunners, returned to produce this episode (as well as \\"A Star Is Burns\\") to ease the workload of the show's regular staff. They worked on it alongside the staff of The Critic, the series they had left The Simpsons to create. The episode marks the series' first time that a recurring character was killed off, something the staff had considered for a while. The episode features numerous cultural references, including Carole King's song \\"Jazzman\\", the actor James Earl Jones and the Kimba the White Lion/The Lion King controversy. The episode also features the phrase \\"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\\", used by Groundskeeper Willie to describe the French. The phrase has since entered the public lexicon. It has been used and referenced by journalists and academics, and it appears in two Oxford quotation dictionaries. Plot Bart gets a stomach ache after accidentally eating a jagged metal Krusty-O prize packed in his breakfast cereal. Thinking Bart is feigning illness to avoid a history test, Homer and Marge send him to school anyway. After Bart struggles through the test, Mrs. Krabappel allows him to visit the school nurse once she sees he actually may be ill. Bart collapses in the nurse's office and is taken to Springfield General Hospital, where he undergoes appendicitis surgery from Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick. While visiting Bart in the hospital, Lisa discovers her hero, jazzman Bleeding Gums Murphy, is a patient in another ward. He is destitute after spending all the royalties from his only album, Sax on the Beach, on a $1500-a-day Faberg√© egg habit. Bart's classmates admire his scar and demand to have appendectomies of their own. Lisa spends time with Murphy, who lends her his saxophone for a school recital. With most of the orchestra absent while recovering from appendix surgery, the remaining trio perform and Lisa is a hit with the crowd. She is saddened to learn that Bleeding Gums has died when she returns to the hospital the next day. Lisa is the only person who attends his funeral, where Reverend Lovejoy misidentifies him as a sousaphone player. Lisa vows to make sure that everyone in Springfield appreciates Bleeding Gums' musical legacy. Bart sues Krusty the Clown and is given a $100,000 settlement. After Bart's attorney Lionel Hutz deducts his legal fees, Bart is left with only $500. Still stricken with grief, Lisa decides that the best way to honor Bleeding Gums' memory is by having his album played on the local jazz station. Lisa spots it at the Android's Dungeon for $250; after hearing that Bleeding Gums is dead, Comic Book Guy doubles the price to $500. As she leaves, Bart arrives with his $500 settlement to buy a pog with Steve Allen's face. After seeing his sister's sad face through the shop window, Bart buys Lisa the album because she was the only one who believed his stomach ache was real. When she says he will never again see $500, Bart shows her a box of new Krusty-Os with flesh-eating bacteria which he intends to eat and sue Krusty again with. When the radio station plays one of Bleeding Gums' songs, Lisa is disappointed because the station's tiny range prevents anyone from hearing it. Lightning strikes the antenna, giving it extra power and projecting it into every radio in Springfield. She is satisfied and turns to leave, but Bleeding Gums appears from the heavens to tell Lisa that she has made \\"an old jazz man happy\\". Mufasa from The Lion King, Darth Vader from the Star Wars film series, and James Earl Jones then appear in the clouds alongside Bleeding Gums, who tells them to keep quiet. After saying their final goodbyes, Lisa and Bleeding Gums perform \\"Jazzman\\" one last time. Production \\"'Round Springfield\\" was written by Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, based on a story idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. It was the first episode directed by Steven Dean Moore. Due to Fox's demand for 24 to 25 episodes per season, which the production staff found impossible to meet, two episodes of each season were written and produced by former showrunners, to relieve the stress on The Simpsons writing staff. Jean and Reiss, who were showrunners for the show's third and fourth seasons, returned to produce this episode, as well as \\"A Star Is Burns\\", instead of the season's main showrunner David Mirkin. On both episodes, they were aided by the staff of The Critic, the show the two left The Simpsons to create. Sternin and Ventimilia were writers on The Critic and were big fans of The Simpsons, so were thrilled to be able to write an episode. Steve Allen made his second guest appearance in this episode. This episode marked the first time a recurring character has been killed off on the show. The writers and production team felt that it would be a good, emotional storyline, which, through Lisa, could focus on the theme of grief. They decided that it could not be one of the main characters; Jean joked that \\"we wouldn't want it to be someone like Mr. Burns, that we'd obviously want to see in the show again\\". Eventually, Jean decided on Bleeding Gums Murphy, a character introduced in the season one episode \\"Moaning Lisa\\"; a flashback to \\"Moaning Lisa\\" is featured in the episode. Murphy was a fairly minor character, only appearing in a couple of episodes, but he appeared in the show's opening sequence and remained there after this episode, until the opening was re-designed in season 20. Moore's first ever job on the show was in the animation department for \\"Moaning Lisa\\" so he \\"appreciated\\" being able to direct this episode. Reiss stated, \\"I had been polling for years to kill Marge's mom but this was a better idea\\". Actor Ron Taylor returned to guest star as Murphy in the episode. Comedian Steve Allen also made his second guest appearance on the show, having previously appeared in the episode \\"Separate Vocations\\". The main story of the episode's first act sees Bart get appendicitis from eating a jagged metal Krusty-O. Mike Reiss's father, being a doctor, \\"sort of\\" acted as the medical consultant on this episode. He stated that \\"you can't get\\" appendicitis from eating a piece of metal, but the writers decided to do it anyway. In his flashback, Murphy is shown as having a \\"$1,500 a day Faberg√© egg habit\\". Al Jean \\"didn't realize just how expensive\\" Faberg√© eggs actually were (in 2013, a collector revealed he spent just over $100 million to purchase nine Faberg√© eggs \\"The World's Most Beautiful Eggs: The Genius of Carl Faberge\\" BBC FOUR), so the joke does not make much sense. Cultural references The episode contains numerous references to popular culture. The title is a play on both the jazz standard 'Round Midnight by Thelonious Monk and the similarly named film also about an unappreciated jazz musician. When a deceased Bleeding Gums Murphy appears to Lisa in a cloud towards the end of the episode, he is joined by Darth Vader, Mufasa, and James Earl Jones. Although all three roles were originally portrayed by Jones, the characters in this scene were impersonated by cast member Harry Shearer; Jones himself guest starred twice previously. Additionally, Mufasa accidentally mentions \\"Kimba\\" and corrects himself by saying \\"Simba\\". This is a reference to the debate regarding The Lion Kings resemblance to the anime Kimba the White Lion. Lisa and Bleeding Gums play Carole King's song \\"Jazzman\\" in this scene and in the hospital earlier in the episode. Bleeding Gums has to leave at the end of the scene because he has a date with the jazz singer Billie Holiday. Additionally, Homer has a Starland Vocal Band tattoo on his arm, Bart considers buying a Steve Allen \\"ultimate pog\\", and the music heard just before Bart's operation is a parody of the theme music of ER. Bleeding Gums appears on an episode of The Cosby Show, a reference to Bill Cosby often getting jazz musicians he liked to appear on the show; in the episode, Cosby is voiced by The Simpsons regular Dan Castellaneta. Lionel Hutz's \\"crack team of lawyers\\", Robert Shaporo and Albert Dershman, are parodies of Robert Shapiro and Alan Dershowitz, two of the defense attorneys at the O. J. Simpson murder case. The three drive away in a white pickup truck, similar to the Ford Bronco that Al Cowlings and O.J. Simpson drove in their televised low-speed pursuit before Simpson's arrest. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"'Round Springfield\\" finished 60th in the ratings for the week of April 24 to April 30, 1995, with a Nielsen rating of 8.2. The episode was the fourth highest rated show on the Fox network that week. Mike Reiss and Al Jean thought that the episode would \\"get a ton of awards\\", and joked that this was why they opted to receive a story credit, which they usually would not. Ultimately it did not win any awards. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, found that it was \\"a real tear-jerker\\" and praised Grampa believing everything he saw was death. In a DVD review of the sixth season, Ryan Keefer of DVD Verdict rated the episode a \\"B\\". Adam Finley of TV Squad praised the episode, noting its many \\"great moments\\" including \\"Steve Allen pimping his books on TV: How to Make Love to Steve Allen; Happiness is a Naked Steve Allen; Journey to the Center of Steve Allen; The Joy of Cooking Steve Allen\\" and \\"Moe running a \\"retox\\" clinic right next to a detox clinic\\". The podcast Put it in H - A Die Hard Simpsons Podcast praised the episode for its \\"high number of laughs per minute while still being full of heart\\". However, Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode \\"dull\\", stating that \\"some of the moments connected to Bart's illness are funny\\", but that he \\"really hate[s] that \\"Jazzman\\" song\\" and dislikes \\"the Bleeding Gums parts\\". =Cheese-eating surrender monkeys= In the episode, budget cuts at Springfield Elementary School force the janitor Groundskeeper Willie to be used as a French teacher. Expressing his disdain for the French, he exclaims to his class: \\"Bonjour, you cheese-eatin' surrender monkeys.\\" The quote, particularly the phrase \\"cheese- eating surrender monkeys\\", has since entered wider use. It was used particularly in the run-up to the war in Iraq, having been popularized by the conservative National Review journalist Jonah Goldberg, to describe European and especially French opposition to military action. A piece in The Guardian noted that the phrase was \\"made acceptable in official diplomatic channels around the globe\\". Ben Macintyre has written that the phrase is \\"perhaps the most famous\\" of the show's coinages and since Goldberg's usage it \\"has gone on to become a journalistic clich√©\\". It has subsequently been used by the New York Post (as \\"Surrender Monkeys\\") as the headline for its December 7, 2006, front page, referring to the Iraq Study Group and its recommendation that U.S. soldiers be withdrawn from Iraq by early 2008. The Daily Telegraph has cited it in relation to Anglo-French military cooperation. The term has been used in books by commentator Laura Ingraham, and academics Stuart Croft, Stephen Chan, and Paul L. Moorcraft and Philip M. Taylor. Ned Sherrin included the quote in the Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations; it was introduced in the third edition in 2005. It is also included in the Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations. Douglas Coupland's 2009 novel Generation A refers to Groundskeeper Willie's use of the phrase. The line was written by Ken Keeler during one of the episode's re-write sessions, although none of those present on the episode's DVD audio commentary could remember for sure. According to Reiss, Keeler called it his \\"greatest contribution to the show.\\" The writers were surprised it became as widely used as it did and never meant it as a political statement, merely as an \\"obnoxious\\" joke for Willie. The French dub of the show uses the line \\"singes mangeurs de fromage\\", omitting the word \\"surrender\\".

She began gymnastics at the age of three, though she told her coach she was five because she was afraid that he would not accept such a young gymnast.Sabina Cojocar Official Webpage A few years later, she was accepted into the junior national team in One≈üti. After one year, Cojocar was accepted as a member of the senior national team in Deva, under the direct guidance of head coach Octavian Bellu. She made her international debut at the age of fourteen at the 2000 Junior European Championships in Paris, where she won three gold medals (in the all- around,International Gymnast Magazine, \\"A new voice\\", by John Crumlish, October 2010, page 46 ahead of teammate Silvia Stroescu, and on vault and balance beam) and two silver medals (on floor exercise and with the team). She was touted as the new leader of the young Romanian team and quickly drew international attention, appearing on the cover of the June/July 2000 edition of International Gymnast. Senior career In August 2001, Cojocar competed in the Goodwill Games in Brisbane, Australia. She won the all-around title, upsetting more established gymnasts, such as Russia's Svetlana Khorkina, and earned a bronze medal on the floor exercise. Her first major senior event was later in the year at the 2001 World Championships in Ghent, Belgium, where she placed first with the Romanian team, sixth in the all-around, and fourth on beam.Gymnastics results 2001 World artistic gymnastics championships Cojocar underwent shoulder surgery in December 2001.

She claimed the she had complained of weakness and of severe muscle and ligament pain, but Bellu forced her to continue training and take the medication. In addition, Cojocar alleged that Bellu was physically abusive to the gymnasts, and that some girls had suffered \\"terrible beatings\\".

This so-called \\"Shield World\\" was meant to protect the Forerunners and their technology from the Flood, and the Forerunners or another life form from the Halo Array's firing. The entire inside of the shell is habitable and thus must have some sort of artificial gravity system to keep everything from floating off the surface. Also, in the Halo series, Shield Worlds are Micro-Dyson Spheres often protected by a planet-sized Dyson Swarm of sentries called Sentinels, whereas the Shield World itself will protect its inhabitors from the superweapon's firing, and the Sentinels will protect the Micro-Dyson Sphere from being destroyed by means of weapons or asteroids and such, as is the case with the Shield World called \\"Onyx\\" in the book by Eric Nylund \\"Halo: Ghosts of Onyx\\". Albeit the Micro-Dyson Sphere in question is said to be externally \\"only a few meters in diameter\\", while internally is approximately the size of Earth's orbit around our sun, with a small artificial star. In Halo 4, Master Chief, Cortana, and the UNSC ship Infinity encounter the Forerunner Shield World Requiem, which is a prison for a Forerunner war criminal known as the Didact. Part of the game takes place inside Requiem on the inner surface of the shell while another part takes place on the inside of yet another shell inside of the first one effectively creating a shell inside a shell the inner one of which can be seen by looking up in game. *In the PC/Xbox 360/PS3 game Mass Effect 2, the geth character Legion (a sentient artificial intelligence) mentions the Dyson sphere as the closest analogue to the mega structure its species is currently working: since geth are networked programs (e.g. Legion is a \\"mobile platform\\" for over a thousand of them), such massive platform for the consciousnesses would ensure that \\"no geth would ever be alone\\", which is their idea of utopia. Said Dyson swarm is destroyed by the quarian forces during the events of Mass Effect 3, sending the geth into an equivalent of panic as countless programs are destroyed permanently. **Additionally, antimatter fuel production plants built by organic races are Dyson swarms powering planet-bound particle accelerators. *In the PC/Xbox One/PS4 game Mass Effect Andromeda, Meridian is described at a \\"Dyson Moon\\", a 3,600 km diameter, hollow shell encompassing a power source that provides heat and light to lush green biomes in the interior. *In the Nintendo DS video game Infinite Space, the \\"Overlords\\"‚Äîa transcendent race responsible for the destruction and rebirth of universes‚Äîuse a Dyson sphere attached to the Sun to power the \\"True Void Gate\\" with which they access and manipulate the current universe. *The Facebook game Galaxy Legion features Dyson Spheres as one of the discoverable and colonizable types in the galaxy, although they are extremely rare. *In the role-playing game Final Fantasy XIII, the floating utopia of Cocoon is a Dyson Shell.

He made headlines in Quebec for being a vocal and confrontational opponent of the Charter of the French Language and Quebec nationalism as one of the most prominent leaders of the \\"angryphone\\" movement, before moving to Ontario and criticising official bilingualism in Canada.  Youth  Galganov reportedly had an activist history. His grandfather, a Russian Jew, came to Canada to escape communism. In the 1960s, as a member of the Jewish Defense League, Galganov threw coffins on the Soviet embassy lawn in Ottawa to protest the treatment of Jewish \\"refuseniks\\".^The Independent: Canada learns a new language of protest  Quebec activism  By the 1990s, Howard Galganov had become an outspoken critic of the Quebec sovereignty movement and of the Canadian government for not defending the rights of English-speaking citizens living in the Canadian province of Quebec, stating that banning the use of English entirely is a violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. His goals were defending the equality of all languages, laws defending bilingual equality in Canada, defence against the local unlawful banning of all English in print, as well as the freedom of the individual to choose freely for themselves. He worked to bring awareness to those outside of Quebec on the human rights abuses being enacted in Quebec against anglophones, as noted by both the United Nations and the Supreme Court of Canada. After a 1995 Quebec referendum on sovereignty for the province of Quebec, Galganov founded the Quebec Political Action Committee (QPAC), serving as its president (and only member) until 2000. One of Galganov‚Äôs first prominent QPAC activities was to organize a protest at Fairview Pointe-Claire, a shopping mall, in 1996 in the predominantly anglophone West Island of Montreal to protest that retail stores were not placing any English on their commercial signs despite being allowed under the Charter of the French Language.Montreal Gazette (18 April 1996) Estimated attendance at the protest varied from 500 to 5,000.World Paper (USA) (1 October 1999) Galganov followed up this protest with threatened boycotts of prominent retail stores. He also protested the actions of the Office qu√©b√©cois de la langue fran√ßaise on numerous issues including when language inspectors ordered stores to remove kosher products from their shelves just before Passover because they weren't labelled in the French language.B'Nai Brith Canada (1996) These activities caused a reaction among fringe Quebec nationalist groups, garnering publicity for Galganov.See David Layton-Brown, Canadian Annual Review of Politics and Public Affairs (1996), p.137 Later in 1996, he gave a speech at the Harvard Club of New York, in spite of requests not to do so from federal and provincial officials concerned that it might discourage foreign investment in Canada; the speech went ahead regardless. Maclean's Magazine; see also Layton-Brown, p.137 In 1997, he opened a store with perfectly equal French and English in all signage, deliberately violating the commercial sign provisions of the Charter of the French Language act in order to provoke reactionary measures and media awareness.McGill Daily After his QPAC activities, Galganov attempted several more politically related activities. In June 1997, he unsuccessfully ran for parliament as an independent, coming in second.Elections Canada In 1997, he started hosting an AM radio talk show on Montreal radio station CIQC-AM, first in the morning and then at noon. He was on the air for just over a year (replaced in the morning show by Montreal broadcaster Jim Duff),Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (14 August 1998) and made efforts to help rally support for William Johnson in his run for the leadership of Alliance Quebec. He also ran for mayor of the town of Saint-Lazare, Quebec, placing third.McGill Daily (4 February 2008)  Ontario activism  Shortly after his Saint-Lazare mayoralty campaign, he moved to Eastern Ontario. He ran as an independent candidate in the Ontario riding of Stormont-Dundas-South Glengarry in the federal election of October 14, 2008, advocating an end to official bilingualism and the separation of Quebec from Canada, and finishing fourth with 5.7% of the vote.Elections Canada Galganov, along with Jean-Serge Brisson, a local business owner, is challenging in provincial court a regulation on mandatory bilingual signage adopted on June 16, 2008 by the township of Russell.

WCDB currently broadcasts at 90.9 FM with a signal covering the Capital District and reaching parts of Western Massachusetts. The station is staffed completely by students and operates on a 24/7 schedule. WCDB's programming includes a wide range of alternative music programs. The station is available worldwide via streaming on their website. History as WSUA The first traces of campus radio activity at the Albany campus appeared in the 1940s when the University Radio Council was formed. This organization made initial plans for the creation of a campus station tentatively called WCFA (College For Teachers, UAlbany's first incarnation) and WSCA. In 1962, the college became a University in the State University of New York system. WSUA debuted on February 22, 1963 as a \\"carrier current\\" AM radio station, with the broadcast transmissions propagated via and confined to the electrical wiring of the college campus. The frequency was 640 kHz. At the time, a school newspaper account specified the station's power at eight watts. WSUA was located in a janitor's closet in Brubacher Hall in what is today called the \\"Downtown campus.\\" At the time, the format consisted of news, sports and music in the jazz, classical and Broadway vein. A Top 40 format was later adopted. In the mid 1960s, WSUA upgraded their studio space to the basement of Brubacher Hall, where space for more studios and record storage was available. Around this time, the station's carrier current signal was initiated at the new \\"Uptown\\" campus. The electrical wires used to carry the signal often imparted a buzzing sound on the transmission. In 1975, the station began to use the slogan \\"Buzz Along With Us\\" on some promotional items to acknowledge this fact. A more progressive type of rock music format was introduced in 1968 and would later become the dominant format, displacing the Top 40 music. At the same time, WSUA began sports coverage of the Great Danes basketball and football teams. The station also featured a daily news digest called Earwitness News beginning in 1973. By mandate of the Student Association, the station was required to use this specific ID for its top of the hour announcement: \\"WSUA Albany, subsidized completely by student tax paid to the Student Association of the State University of New York at Albany.http://wcdb.org/ History as WCDB WCDB moved from the AM dial on to the FM dial on March 1, 1978 with the song \\"Born To Run\\" by Bruce Springsteen. The station operated with 10 watts of power in FM stereo. In 1981 the State University of New York submitted to the FCC an application to increase the station's transmitter power to 100 watts, which was approved on March 1, 1982. The first song played at the new higher power was \\"Rock and Roll\\" by the Velvet Underground.

One of their primary objectives was to make kart racing as affordable to as many people as possible whilst maintaining a high level of competition. Kart racing in schools has existed since the late sixties. NatSKA is a nationwide association that holds race meetings throughout the country at major racetracks such as Blackbushe, Glan-y-Gors, Kimbolton, Rowrah, Rye House, Buckmore park and Whilton Mill. The association has 27 teams as far apart as Tyne and Wear through to Kent and Devon. In March 2008, St Michael's, a school which was a member of the NatSKA, had three go karts stolen from their school base. All race meetings are run by NatSKA under the authority of the Motor Sports Association (MSA) who are responsible for all motor sport in the United Kingdom, including British Touring Cars, Formula 3, Formula Renault and all motorcycle racing including the Moto GP British Grand Prix. Karting as a school activity covers a wide range of educational, academic, technological, social and sporting subjects. It provides a tremendous stimulus to all concerned. Pupils are often motivated to attempt work previously considered to be too advanced or technically difficult, and their teachers can often control and channel this to good effect. Indeed, the practical aspects of designing and building a kart are just as important as the enjoyment of driving.

His feast day is August 31 in Roman Catholicism and September 13 in Eastern Orthodoxy. Biography Very little is known of Aristides, except for the introductory information given by Eusebius of Caesarea and Saint Jerome. According to their account, Aristides practiced philosophy in Athens, where he lived, prior to and after his conversion to Christianity. Eusebius writes in his Ecclesiastical History \\"Aristides also, a faithful disciple of our religion, has left an Apology of the faith dedicated to Hadrian.\\". Eusebius and Jerome both state that the Apology was given to Hadrian at the same time that Quadratus delivered his own apology. This suggests that Aristides gave his apology during Hadrian's reign (r. 117‚Äì138) as emperor of Rome, which supports the theory of Aristides died between the years 133‚Äì134 AD. It is also supported by the express language of the Apology in the Armenian version. It is contradicted only by the second superscription to the Syriac version, which says that the Apology was given to Emperor Antoninus Pius in the year 140. If this is taken to mean that it was delivered in person by Aristides, it would rule out the dating of Aristides's death in 133-134 AD. It has been suggested that Eusebius was confused by the fact that Antoninus Pius had adopted the name \\"Hadrianus\\" (Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius) and believed it was Hadrian to whom the Apology was given, and further that Jerome had never read the Apology and copied Eusebius's mistake accidentally.. But Jerome tells us that the Apology was extant in his day, and he gives an account of its contents. The testimony of Eusebius and Jerome and the text of the Armenian version are all in favor of its being delivered to Hadrian, probably in circa 124‚Äì125 AD. Writings =The Apology of Aristides= In 1878, an Armenian fragment of an apology titled To Emperor Hadrian Caesar from the Athenian Philosopher Aristides was published by the Mechitarists of San Lazzaro in Venice from a 10th-century manuscript. The Armenian translation was accepted by most scholars as the long lost Apology of Aristides; however, a few did dispute its authenticity, most notably Ernest Renan. In 1889, the authenticity of the fragment was confirmed with the discovery of a complete Syriac translation of the Apology by British scholar Rendel Harris in the Monastery of St. Catherine on Mount Sinai. With this new discovery, J.A. Robinson was able to show Aristides's work had been in fact extant and edited in the religious book The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat since the 7th century.. Another fragment of the Apology containing two portions of original text in Greek was published in 1922 by the British Museum on papyri.. The Apology of Aristides is the oldest extant Christian apology since only a fragment of the older apology of Quadratus exists. In the 1889 Syriac translation, Aristides begins his apology by stating his name, where he is from and that he is delivering it to Antoninus Pius. In the first chapter, he proclaims God exists because the world exists and that God is \\"eternal, impassible and perfect.\\" In the second chapter, he writes that there are four races of the world; (1) Barbarians, (2) Greeks (includes Egyptians and Chaldeans), (3) Jews, and (4) Christians. He then devotes chapters 3-16 to describing the different groups of people and how they practice religion. The Barbarians (chapters 3-7) worship dead warriors and the elements of the Earth, which he claims are the works of God, therefore they do not know who the true God is.. The Greeks (chapters 8‚Äì13) are next because: > \\"...they are wiser than the Barbarians but have erred even more than the > Barbarians, in that they have introduced many gods that are made; and some > of them they have represented as male and some of them as female; and in > such a way that some of their gods were found to be adulterers and > murderers, and jealous and envious, and angry and passionate, and murderers > of fathers, and thieves and plunderers.\\". In other words, Aristides is calling the Greek gods corrupt, immoral and guilty of being human. He concludes his chapters on the Greeks by commenting on the religious beliefs of the Egyptians, who he claims are the most ignorant people on earth since they did not accept the beliefs of the Greeks or Chaldeans and instead worshiped gods modeled after plants and animals. The Jews (chapter 14) are only commented on in a concise manner. Aristides commends them for their worship of God as the Creator and almighty but claims they have gone \\"astray\\" because \\"their service is to angels and not to God, in that they observe sabbaths and new moons and the passover and the great fast, and the fast, and circumcision, and cleanness of meats: which things not even thus have they perfectly observed.\\" In chapters 15 and 16, Aristides describes the commandments of God and claims Christians \\"walk in all humility and kindness, and falsehood is not found among them, and they love one another.\\" He explains \\"they ask from Him petitions which are proper for Him to give and for them to receive: and thus they accomplish the course of their lives.\\". He concludes the Apology in chapter 17 by requesting the emperor to stop persecuting the Christians and convert to their faith; where he ends with a nice description of the Christian life. =Other works= It has been suggested that Aristides is the author of the Epistle to Diognetus. This theory is supported by similar writing styles, descriptions of Christians, the treatment of Jews, as well as other similarities. Abb√© H. Doulcet was primarily the leading voice of this theory in the late 19th century. The Epistle to Diognetus has been credited to Justin Martyr but without any sufficient evidence.. Aristides is also credited with a sermon on Luke 23:43. Contribution to other authors =Relation to contemporaries= Aristides is the second Greek Christian apologetic of the 2nd century. His writing style and thesis are very similar to the likes of Quadratus, Aristo of Pella, Justin Martyr and the author of the Epistle to Diognetus. Jerome suggests Aristides's apology was the combined opinions of philosophers at the time and imitated by Justin Martyr afterwards. Negatively, Celsus used the Apology for his arguments against the Jews and \\"also certain features which he used in order to scoff at Providence.\\" However, he was easily countered by Origen. =Influence on later writing= The Apology of Aristides was later adapted into the work The Life of Barlaam and Josaphat during the 7th century. In the book, the Apology is told by a pagan philosopher by the name of Nachor, a character in the legend of Barlaam and Josaphat. The unknown use of the Apology in the book, allowed for the text to remain extant the entire time and influence Christian perception of Buddhism. Only with the rediscovery of the Apology in 1878 and 1889, did it reappear in history books. Rendel Harris,See for a complete study of the Apology. J.A. Robinson and few European scholars provided some commentary and studies of the text in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. There has been little revisionist history on the Apology of late, except for an article by G.C. O'Ceallaigh in 1958. He suggested the Apology was a Jewish work of the 2nd century and was then edited by a Christian writer in the 4th century to be a Christian apology.. W. Fairweather, D.W. Palmer and Massey Hamilton Shepherd Jr. have used the Apology of Aristides, and other apologists' works, in order to support their theories on early Christian thought and Greek apologists of the 2nd century.Refer to , and for more information on early Christian thought and second century Greek apologists.

The Priory is within the confines of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, which encompasses the entirety of Vermont. They are particularly known for the songs they have contributed to Roman Catholic worship over the past 50 years, their connection to Latin America, and the crafts produced at the monastery. History and mission Weston Priory was founded by Abbot Leo A. Rudloff of Dormition Abbey in Jerusalem in 1953. He had the intention that some of those trained in Vermont would later assist the Community at Dormition Abbey in Jerusalem. Abbot Leo also expressed the hope that the Priory would become a Community in its own right in the movement of monastic renewal. Today, the community is an Independent or Conventual Priory. At the beginning, Abbot Leo considered locating the Priory in Pennsylvania or a few other places, but the presence of other religious houses in those places required that he look elsewhere. With the help of friendly Benedictine Oblates (Dr. Leon and Dorothea Smith) from his time in Keyport, New Jersey, he located a suitable site in the Green Mountains of Vermont. The original building was an old abandoned farmhouse with an attached barn, a few miles from the village of Weston. The attached barn had been partially burned and was renovated to become the chapel. Abbot Leo engaged Architects and Builders, a Weston group to renovate the barn-chapel. The main house became the monastery kitchen, dining room, library, and tiny gift shop on the ground floor. Four small separate rooms and the Prior's room occupied the second floor. A dilapidated chicken house behind the main house was renovated to become classroom, recreation room and dormitory for novices. This latter building was heated by a small wood stove and fireplace and had indoor plumbing.A Benedictine Legacy of Peace, the Life of Abbot Leo A. Rudloff, 2005 by John Hammond In a small book titled The Silent Life, published in 1957 Thomas Merton refers to Weston Priory as a new Benedictine foundation of \\"the Primitive Observance\\". The Priory was in fact one of several North American monasteries in the renewal movement of Return to the Sources that preceded Vatican Council II, Thomas Merton considered the community to be one of only a handful that was dedicated to Benedictine renewal, including the separation of priests or \\"choir monks\\" from lay-brothers. Founded on the Rule and the Gospels, the Weston community is dedicated to peace and social justice. Its outreach extends particularly to Latin America and also to caring for the natural world. To that end, the abbey has bonded with a group of Benedictine nuns in Mexico, establishing a retreat Center in Cuernavaca to raise consciousness of North Americans of their southern neighbors. Through the monastery's relationships with senators Patrick Leahy and Bernie Sanders, they have tried to bring more attention to the plight of the poor in Mexico. As part of the National Sanctuary movement, in 1984, the Priory received a family of Guatemalan Refugees to live for several years in the monastery guest house. The Priory was, in the 1980s, one of several hundred churches and religious organizations that pledged to provide a haven for refugees in the United States. =Music and artwork= In the 1960s, the brothers of Weston Priory began writing their own music for use in their community prayer, a central feature of monastic life. They compose much of the music they use when they pray the monastic office and celebrate liturgy. Their music is well known throughout the world, as it has become popular Catholic liturgical worship music. Visitors are invited to join in the prayer and worship of the community. The Community maintains gardens, livestock, and a Gallery Shop book store that includes ceramics, woodwork, calligraphy, candles and other items produced by the brothers. Several pieces of the pottery produced at the monastery are held by museums, such as the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. Notable members The most remembered and outstanding brother in the Weston Priory Community was, without doubt, Abbot Leo Rudloff. With the confidence of Pope John XXIII, Abbot Leo, at that time Abbot of Dormition Abbey in Jerusalem was named to the pre-Vatican Council Commission that included the quest for reconciliation between Christians and Jews. His work preceding the Council was focused on the Council Document Nostra Aetate which began a new era of relationship between Christians and Jews. When he retired as Abbot In Jerusalem, he journeyed to his foundation in Weston and was known as brother Leo. Other well-known community members have included ceramic artist Brother Thomas (Thomas Bezanson) and Gregory Norbet, the composer of much of the community's earlier music. Author Tomie DePaola was briefly a member in 1966.  Awards  In July 1992, the Weston Priory Community was awarded the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award in Sherborn, Massachusetts, for its reception of the Guatemalan Refugee family, Elena and Felipe Ixcot and their five children.
