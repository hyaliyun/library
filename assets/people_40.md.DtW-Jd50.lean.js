The typical growth hormone-regulating gene in the Atlantic salmon was replaced with the growth hormone-regulating gene from Pacific Chinook salmon, with a promoter sequence from ocean pout. This gene enables the GM salmon to grow year-round instead of only during spring and summer. These GE salmon are a commercially competitive alternative to wild-caught salmon and to fish farming of unmodified salmon. The purpose of the modifications is to increase the speed at which the fish grows without affecting its ultimate size or other qualities. Fish-farmed Atlantic salmon growth rates have already been improved over wild fish as a result of traditional selective breeding practices. However, GM fish are able to grow even faster and grow to market size in just 16 to 18 months rather than three years. Significance AquAdvantage salmon are the first genetically engineered animals approved for human consumption in the United States and Canada. This approval has been subject to much controversy. Genetic modification AquAdvantage salmon were developed in 1989 by the addition of a single copy of the opAFP-GHc2 construct, which consists of a promoter sequence from ocean pout directing production of a growth hormone protein using the coding sequence from Chinook salmon. The continuous expression of this transgene allows the fish to grow all year-round instead of only during spring and summer. The stability of the new DNA construct was tested, revealing no additional mutational effects during insertion other than the two desired genes. These GM fish were back-crossed (a two generation breeding protocol that starts by generating a hybrid offspring between two inbred strains, one of them carrying the mutation of interest) to wild-type Atlantic salmon, and the genetically modified EO-1…ë gene sequence was identical in the second through fourth generations, indicating that the insertion is stable. While wild Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) have two sets of chromosomes, raised AquaAdvantage salmon have three sets (i.e. are triploid). Induction of triploidy by treatment of eggs renders the fish sterile, reducing the risk of interbreeding with wild-type fish if any of the genetically modified fish were introduced into the wild.  Concerns  There are three main concerns regarding the approval of GE salmon: \`\`consumption of these fish may be harmful to human, that there will be unintended consequences of the gene alteration and that these fish will escape and intermingle with the wild population. Risks assessments have been conducted to determine the health and safety of this technology and a number of preventatives have been implemented to prevent the release of these fish into the wild. =Ethical= Proponents of natural ethics consider genetically engineered salmon to be \\"unnatural\\" and thus unethical. However, as the global population continues to grow, new and innovative methods will be required to ensure adequate food supply. The fast growing genetically engineered AquAdvantage salmon could be considered ethical under utilitarian ethics as a means to feed a large number of people. =Human health risk assessment= Fish are one of the eight food types that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is required, by law, to treat with special care, with regard to allergies. As part of the regulatory process, the FDA required data on whether changes occur in the kinds or levels of fish allergens (such as parvalbumin) in AquAdvantage. The FDA has upheld that people with allergies to Atlantic Salmon will likely be allergic to AquAdvantage Salmon due to the similar species properties, not because it is genetically engineered and that AquAdvantage Salmon is as safe to eat as non-GE salmon because there are no significant food safety hazards associated with it. Other human health concerns arise about the increase hormone content in the edible tissue of transgenic fish. The AquAdvantage salmon showed statistical difference in the concentration of an insulin-like growth factor, yet the amount of (IGF-1) found in AquAdvantage salmon is similar to, or lower than, other amounts found in other common animal products such as organic cow milk. =Off-target effects of gene editing= A concern with genetic engineering is that another gene other than the one intended may also be accidentally edited. The genome sequence of the AquAdvantage salmon has been analyzed and no off-target effects or changes in other genes have been detected. =Precautionary containment procedures= Critics raised concerns about potential environmental impacts if these fish reached the rivers or oceans. Modeled invasion scenarios in semi-natural environments suggest that GM salmon would out compete wild-type salmon. To address concerns about biological containment, the FDA requires AquaBounty to take precautionary measures to ensure that transgenic fish do not mix with the wild population. Aquaculture that uses conventionally bred salmon, mostly Atlantic salmon, cultivates the fish in net pens. In North America, this occurs mostly in coastal waters off Washington, British Columbia, and Maine. However, the application for FDA approval of AquAdvantage salmon specified land-based tank cultivation with no ocean involvement. AquaBounty also altered the fish to be only female and sterile. Male fish are created only for egg-producing service, and are kept in secure, land-based facilities in Canada. These eggs are then shipped to a land-based aquaculture facility at high altitude in Panama near a river that drains into the Pacific Ocean. If eggs were to escape this facility, they would be unable to survive in the high salinity water nearby. In order to make the fish sterile AquAdvantage salmon eggs are treated with pressure, to create batches of fish eggs with three copies of each chromosome (triploid) rather than to two copies (diploid). Any batch that contains 5 percent or more diploid fish, is destroyed because these diploid fish are capable of reproducing. Government regulation  = United States = In September 2010, an FDA advisory panel indicated that the fish is \\"highly unlikely to cause any significant effects on the environment\\" and that it is \\"as safe as food from conventional Atlantic salmon\\" In October 2010, 39 lawmakers asked the FDA to reject the application. Other groups requested that the fish carry a label identifying its transgenic origin. Concerns included alleged flaws in sterilization and isolation, and excessive antibiotic use. On 25 December 2012, the FDA published a draft environmental assessment for AquAdvantage salmon. The FDA also published a preliminary Finding of No Significant Impact. A 60-day period for the public to comment was to elapse before the FDA reviewed Aquadvantage salmon again, which was arbitrarily extended until May 2013. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved AquaBounty Technologies' application to sell the AquAdvantage salmon to U.S. consumers on November 19, 2015. However, a rider to a spending bill signed into law on December 18, 2015 by President Obama bans its import until the FDA mandates labels for the genetically modified product. The decision marks the first time a genetically modified animal has been approved to enter the United States food supply. The decision came nearly twenty years after the company first submitted data to the FDA, and after they had raised ten generations of the animals. The announcement released by the FDA states: \\"AquAdvantage salmon is as safe to eat as any non-genetically engineered (GE) Atlantic salmon, and also as nutritious.\\" One month later, language was introduced into a proposed federal spending bill requiring consumer notification that the fish is genetically modified. In October, 2018, AquaAdvantage salmon was not being sold in the US and the import of the salmon eggs from Canada to be raised at an AquaAdvantage fish farm in Indiana was prohibited by FDA. However, on March 8, 2019, the import alert issued previously by the FDA was deactivated, and AquAdvantage salmon may now be sold in the U.S. and the salmon eggs may now be imported to the Indiana facility. = Canada = On 25 November 2013, Environment Canada approved the product for salmon egg production for commercial purposes in Canada. In May 2016, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency approved the sale of the GM fish. In July 2017, AquaBounty Technologies said they had sold 4.5 tons of AquaAdvantage salmon fillets to customers in Canada.

Born in Leningrad, Atlantov is the son of bass Andrey Petrovich (1906‚Äì1971) who sang in both the Kirov and Maly opera theaters of Leningrad. His mother, Maria Aleksandrovna Yelizarova, was a lyric soprano who performed in the same opera theaters, taught, and later was a vocal consultant in the Kirov theater. She had been awarded the title of the Honored Artist of the RSFSR. His wife, the soprano Tamara Andreyevna Milashkina, is also an opera singer. She had been awarded the title the People's Artist of the USSR as well as the State Award of the Russian SSR. They have a daughter, Lada (b. 1963). Atlantov grew up in the wings of the opera theater. At the age of six, he joined the Glinka choir school and in 1957 he was accepted in the Leningrad Conservatory. In 1962, while still a student, he was hired as an intern in the Kirov theater. The same year he was awarded the silver medal at the Glinka vocal competition and was allowed to go to Milan, Italy to study at the Teatro alla Scala. Together with other Russian singers he studied with E. Barra and E Piazza. In two years at La Scala, Atlantov learned the parts of the Duke in Rigoletto, Rodolfo in La boheme, Riccardo in Un ballo in maschera, and Cavaradossi in Tosca. After his return from Italy, Atlantov sang Alvaro in the Kirov opera's La forza del destino. Sol Hurok heard him in the part and invited him to sing at the New York Metropolitan Opera which would have been Atlantov's first foreign tour. However, the official permission for the tour never came. 1966 saw Atlantov as Gherman in Tchaikovsky's The Queen of Spades. The same year he became the first prize winner at the 3rd Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow. After that Atlantov, was transferred to the Bolshoy Theater in Moscow. His first operas there were La traviata and Eugene Onegin. In 1967 Atlantov won the first prize at the 3rd International Competition in Sofia and the fourth prize winner at the International competition in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He also went to Milan with the Bolshoy Theater. While at the Bolshoy, Atlantov sang 18 roles, 13 of which were new for him. One of his best roles became Otello. In 1978 he was one of seven tenors invited to sing in the Teatro San Carlo in Naples on the occasion of Enrico Caruso's 100th anniversary. In 1987, he was named a Kammers√§nger of the Vienna opera. In 1988, Atlantov left Russia and the Bolshoy Opera, and continued his career in Europe. Parts that he sang most often in the best opera houses of the world were Gherman, Canio, and Otello. Video record of his performances: Sadko - Bolshoy, 1975; The Queen of Spades - Bolshoy, 1982; Otello - Arena di Verona, 1982; Khovanshchina - Vienna, 1989; The Queen of Spades - Vienna, 1991.

The school is located at 86 Martin Luther King Avenue in the Lincolnville National Historic District of St. Augustine, Florida was an all black Catholic school built in 1898. The money for construction of the school ($7,500) was donated by Katherine Drexel (1858‚Äì1955), a nun of the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament, an order founded \\"to serve Indians and Colored People.\\" Drexel a member of the wealthy Philadelphia, Pennsylvania banking family was the niece of Anthony J. Drexel founder of Drexel University. Katherine Drexel was made a Catholic saint by Pope John Paul II in 2000. The school named in honor of St. Benedict the Moor was constructed of brick and was one of the first schools for black students in Florida. The students were instructed by nuns of a local convent of the Sisters of St. Joseph. There were between 90-100 students enrolled per year at the school which was opened between 1898 and 1968. The school is located on a parcel of land which includes the school on the southern end of the property, the parish house in the center and the church of St. Benedict the Moor at the north end. During 1964, Martin Luther King Jr. used the rectory as a meeting place to plan marches. The school was closed soon after, partly as a result of school desegregation legislation which arose in the wake of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The events which occurred in St. Augustine, of which Martin Luther King Jr. played a key role, were an important catalyst in the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Years prior to the Civil Rights Era, in 1916, three white Catholic nuns were arrested for violating a 1913 Florida law prohibiting white teachers for instructing blacks. The three were acquitted on the grounds that the law did not apply to private schools. St. Benedict the Moor School, which sits in the Lincolnville National Historic District, was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Despite this designation the building sits exposed to the elements with no roof or windows. The roof was removed during 2006 as part of a restoration project which has been stalled for an alleged lack of funding.St. Augustine and St. Johns County: A Historical Guide by William R.

Early life Demos is the grandson of immigrants. His mother was a public school teacher, and his father was an attorney in private practice. Demos grew up in New York City where he attended high school, and now lives in Holbrook, New York. Demos received his B.A. from Columbia University, majoring in political science, and his J.D. from Fordham Law School. Career =Securities and Exchange Commission= Demos prosecuted white collar fraud as a prosecutor at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) between 2002 and 2009. =Politics= New York's 1st congressional district Demos vied in 2010 for the Republican nomination to compete for the congressional seat of Democrat Tim Bishop on Long Island in New York State in the November 2010 election, coming in second in the primary. His three-way primary included Christopher Nixon Cox, a grandson of Richard Nixon and son of the state GOP chairman, and businessman Randy Altschuler. Cox's father-in-law to-be, John Catsimatidis, the Gristedes supermarket and oil magnate, raised ethical issues about Demos' time at the SEC, saying he was accused of improprieties, and the subject of a related disciplinary complaint. Demos provided a letter reflecting that he was cleared of the complaint. John Jay LaValle, Suffolk County Republican chairman, opined in February 2010 that Demos was a qualified and \\"extraordinary\\" candidate for the Republican Party's nomination to be a congressman in the 1st District from eastern Long Island. It was Demos's first run for office. He used the strategy firm Shawmut Group, which was formed in 2008 by Mitt Romney's advisors. In January 2010, Demos appointed to his political team Rob Cole, a former advisor to former New York Governor George Pataki, and a member of Romney's 2008 campaign team. That month, Demos also announced that he had raised more than $300,000 for his campaign. At the end of 2009, his campaign had $275,000. He also issued his first TV ad, a 30-second commercial that attacked Bishop for supporting \\"reckless\\" fiscal policy. In April 2010, Demos said that the Suffolk Conservatives were \\"inexplicably\\" preparing to endorse Altschuler. Demos called Altschuler a \\"pro-choice, outsourcing proponent\\" and former member of the Green Party, which embraces \\"radical Marxist ideologies.\\" In July 2010 he issued a new radio ad, in which he identified himself as the \\"only Conservative\\" in the contest. That month he also said that Tea Party members had been supporting his candidacy. In August 2010, he accused Altschuler of stealing another candidate's press releases, pointing to identical releases from Altschuler and Doug Hoffman, a candidate in for another New York congressional seat who uses the same consultant on some issues. That month he also accused rival Chris Cox of using his father-in-law to-be, Catsimatidis, for \\"dirty tricks\\". That month he also objected to the proposed construction of the Park51 community center near Ground Zero. He said that the St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church, the only religious structure destroyed in the 9/11 attacks, should be rebuilt before moving forward on building an Islamic community center in the area, and called for an investigation into the center's financing. In the days leading up to the primary, Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh did a \\"six-minute radio riff in support of George Demos in NY-1, calling the former SEC attorney the only conservative in the race.\\" In the September 2010 primary, Altschuler finished first with 45 percent of the vote, Demos had 30 percent, and Cox was third with 24 percent. 2012 Congressional campaign Demos announced another run for Congress Monday, August 8, 2011. Shortly after his announcement, Demos called Randy Altschuler, the other announced Republican candidate, \\"unelectable\\" for losing in a district with a 30,000 Republican voter edge in 2010. Demos also chided Altschuler for taking the same position as incumbent Congressman Tim Bishop on the 2011 debt ceiling compromise. Citing his impending wedding, Demos withdrew from the race May 25, 2012. 2014 Congressional campaign On October 6, 2013, he announced he would seek the Republican nomination to run against Congressman Tim Bishop. On June 24, 2014 he lost the primary election to New York State Senator Lee Zeldin.http://riverheadnewsreview.timesreview.com/2014/06/55552/zeldin-holds- early-lead-in-gop-primary/ Whistleblower controversy and dismissal In June 2011, it was reported by the Project On Government Oversight that the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York reopened an investigation into Demos for allegedly disclosing the identity of a JPMorgan Chase whistleblower while Demos served as an attorney at the SEC. Initially the 10th Judicial District Grievance Committee disposed of the allegations. However, the court committee transferred the investigation to \\"avoid the appearance of impropriety.\\" In a letter dated September 23, 2011, the Third Judicial Department dismissed the matter again, stating \\"the Committee has determined that there is an insufficient basis for a finding of professional misconduct.\\"  Personal Life  Demos is married to Chrysa Tsakopoulos, daughter of the real estate developer Angelo Tsakopoulos.His sister-in-law, Eleni Kounalakis, is the current Lieutenant Governor of California.

Players Notable members include Sophie Brack, Kathleen Mills, Gerry Hughes, Kathleen Cody, Judy Doyle, Mona Walsh and Elizabeth McNicholl.

In 1938 this facility attracted to the club the daughters of two men who worked at Inchicore railway works, Kathleen Cody and Kathleen Mills Promotion The club was promoted from intermediate in 1938 and defeated senior champions UCD in their first match, all their scores being scored by \\"the young Kathleen Cody,\\" who was 14 at the time. Within weeks another 14-year-old, Kathleen Mills played for the juniors and was promoted to the senior team for her second match. Challenge matches Much of the success of the GSR team was based on their use of free rail travel facilities to play challenge matches in other parts of the country, often against full-strength teams. They beat full strength county teams from Antrim and Meath in 1940. Greatest era In 1951 won the three most prized trophies in club camogie at the time, the Isle of Man cup, the Dublin league and the Dublin championship, a feat never before accomplished by any single team in one season. They were unbeaten for two years 1953-55. Disunity The club disaffiliated from Dublin County Board during two periods of unrest in the 1940s and affiliated directly to Central Council o the Camogie Association, in 1939-41 and 1945-48. This meant that the club had little or no opposition in Dublin or Leinster when their one-club selection represented Dublin, most famously to contest the Al Ireland finals of 1941 and 1947 and winning the All Ireland title in 1948. The club even set up an alternative Dublin county board in 1947 but were asked by central Council not to pursue this policy.

History One of the first metal band in South Tyrol, Still Blind achieved international success during the 1980s, especially thank to their first album Still Blind (1989) and the following European tour (Encyclopaedia Metallum, 2007). As one of the most successful and internationally popular bands from South Tyrol (√öpln√° datab√°ze popul√°rn√≠ hudby, UMD, 1999), together with Graveworm and Skanners, Still Blind continued their career with the 1991 masterpiece Whales (The Metal Archives, 2002). After touring for years with the same line up, the band officially split in 2001, but the Giovanett Brothers continued parallel careers within several projects (Italian Metal Encyclopedia, 2001). Helmuth Giovanett started concentrating on ethnic music, and his brother Reinhold published with Josef Oberhollenzer two demo-CDs: Kaspar Hauser (1999) and Hinter den Bergen (2000). In 2004 Reinhold Giovanett founded Godzilla Intermezzo with the guitarist Roland Novak and the drummer Zeljko Marinkoviƒá. The project started as a Mot√∂rhead-Coverband, but became more and more doom‚Äìprogressive metal oriented, with the album Orgasmatron, published in 2005.

Brian also serves as a member of the Editorial Board of Health and Human Rights: An International Journal at the Harvard School of Public Health. He is an alumnus of Boston College High School'81, as well as an Ignatius Award winner. He holds an undergraduate degree from Middlebury College and JD from Georgetown Law. He is the recipient of the Wasserstein Public Interest Fellowship from Harvard Law School the Brandeis International Fellowship in Human Rights, Intervention, and International Law and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Canisius College. Brian has qualified as an expert witness on country conditions Haiti in over 40 cases in the U.S. and Canada, appearing on behalf of both applicants and the U.S. government. Bureau des Avocats Internationaux After working for the United Nations as a Human Rights Officer for 2 years (1995‚Äì1996), Concannon co-managed the Bureau des Avocats Internationaux (BAI), Haiti's only public interest law office with Mario Joseph between 1996 and 2004. During his time at BAI, Concannon played an essential role in preparing the prosecution of the landmark Raboteau Massacre trial in 2000. As many as 50 people were killed in the Raboteau in 1994.http://www.ncbuy.com/reference/country/humanrights.html?code=ha&sec;=1 Six years after the slaughter, Concannon and BAI were able to convict 16 defendants guilty for their role in the massacre. The Court also issued a civil damages judgment against the defendants for 1 billion gourdes (roughly $43 million). A documentary was made about the trial which features extensive interviews with Concannon. BAI was tasked with various other cases during this time period, geared primarily toward seeking justice for the victims of ex- military and paramilitary violence in Haiti (which has been documented in depth), and BAI was also involved in the investigation into the murder of famed Haitian radio journalist Jean Dominique. Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti In 2004, Concannon left Haiti and returned to the United States to found the Institute for Justice & Democracy in Haiti (IJDH) after the February 2004 coup d'√©tat that overthrew Haiti's president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. IJDH was founded specifically as the sister group of BAI. IJDH and BAI work collaboratively on all their projects. IJDH is based in Boston, Massachusetts. Concannon successfully represented former Prime Minister and political prisoner Yvon Neptune in the first Haiti case ever decided by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. In January 2016, Concannon taught a class on human rights at Whitman College. He was also an integral part of the IJDH team that sued the United Nations for their responsibility in bringing cholera to Haiti. The case was dismissed both by the UN and in the NY Federal Court on the basis of UN immunity. In December 2016, the then UN Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon finally apologized for the cholera outbreak in Haiti, saying he was \\"profoundly sorry\\" for the outbreak.

Yap is one of the four administrative divisions of the FSM. The entire island, only in length, experienced typhoon force winds, and 90% of the structures were damaged or destroyed. Damage was most severe in southeastern Yap, where the eyewall struck and winds exceeded 185 km/h (115 mph), but the center of the typhoon passed south of the island. Typhoon Sudal originally formed on April 2, 2004, out of a persistent area of convection east of the FSM. It moved mostly westward for the first week of its duration, with brief northerly and southwesterly turns. Sudal attained tropical storm status on April 5, and it gradually intensified into a typhoon, which is a tropical cyclone with winds of at least 119 km/h (74 mph) and is the equivalent of a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. On April 9, it passed just south of Yap, and shortly thereafter its peak winds were estimated at 240 km/h (150 mph). Later, Sudal moved to the northwest and eventually to the northeast, becoming an extratropical cyclone on April 16 and dissipating two days later. In addition to the damage on Yap, the typhoon dropped heavy rainfall in Chuuk in the Federated States of Micronesia, where some minor crop damage occurred. Sudal also brushed the United States islands of Guam and Rota with high waves and light rainfall, and later moved very close to the uninhabited Japanese island of Iwo Jima. Overall damage was $14 million (2004 USD, $16.1 million 2010 USD), most of which was on Yap, although no fatalities or serious injuries were reported. Due to the heavy damage, the name was retired and replaced with \\"Mirinae\\". The name \\"Sudal\\" was contributed by South Korea for the Pacific tropical cyclone list and is the Korean name for the otter. Meteorological history The origins of Typhoon Sudal were from a persistent area of convection, or thunderstorms, southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia toward the end of March 2004. Initially, it was in an area of high wind shear, which is the change in wind direction with height and is unfavorable for tropical cyclogenesis. The unfavorable conditions gradually abated, which allowed convection to increase over a broad, developing circulation center. On April 2, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a weak tropical depression near Chuuk in the FSM. It was later classified with the international designation of 0401, meaning it was the first tropical cyclone of 2004. Slow development continued as the system moved slowly westward, and two days later it was classified as Tropical Depression 03W by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC); this was the third tropical cyclone tracked by the agency. Shortly thereafter, the JTWC upgraded the depression to tropical storm status, after convection increased over the circulation. While steadily intensifying, the system turned toward the north. On April 5, the JMA named the system Sudal, after assessing its maximum sustained winds at 65 km/h (40 mph 10-min sustained). Concurrently, the JTWC estimated winds of 100 km/h (65 km/h 1-min sustained). After crossing over the island of Poluwat, a building ridge to the north caused Sudal to turn west-southwestward. On April 6, an eye feature began forming, and the JTWC upgraded Sudal to typhoon strength about southeast of Guam, a small island under possession of the United States. The JMA did not follow suit until late the following day, by which time the eye had become more distinct. Around that time, the typhoon turned toward the northwest, and initially it was thought that Sudal would pass safely north of Yap in the FSM. Instead, it turned to the west-southwest toward the island as the ridge intensified. On April 8, the typhoon intensified rapidly; the JTWC reported winds of 215 km/h (135 mph 1-min sustained), or the equivalent of a Category 4 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane scale. Weakening slightly as its forward motion slowed, Typhoon Sudal passed about south of Yap at 0000 UTC on April 9, which was its closest approach to the island. Intensification continued throughout the day on April 9, with the appearance of concentric eyewalls on satellite imagery; such a feature is indicative of an intense tropical cyclone. Early on April 10, the JTWC estimated that Sudal attained peak winds of 240 km/h (150 mph 1-min sustained), making the cyclone a super typhoon. At the same time, the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km/h (105 mph 10-min sustained), as well as a barometric pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg). Also on that day, Sudal entered the area of warning responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), which provided the name \\"Cosme\\" for local advisories. For several days, the typhoon continued to the northwest, fluctuating in intensity but remaining powerful. On April 12, Sudal turned toward the north and northeast through a weakness in the ridge, and its eye increased to a diameter of about . The next day, the typhoon attained a secondary peak intensity of 230 km/h (145 mph 1-min sustained), although it gradually weakened subsequently due to a combination of increasing upper-level wind shear and cooler water temperatures. The eye of Typhoon Sudal striking Yap on April 9 Early on April 15, Sudal passed very near the uninhabited Japanese island of Iwo Jima as a rapidly weakening typhoon; at the time, its circulation center was exposed from the deepest convection. Shortly thereafter, both the JTWC and JMA downgraded Sudal to tropical storm status. Late on April 15, the JTWC assessed the storm as becoming extratropical, although the JMA maintained advisories until the following day. As an extratropical storm, Sudal continued northeastward until losing its identity early on April 18, well east of Japan and far south of the Aleutian Islands. Impact Damage wrought by the storm on Yap Early in its duration as a weak tropical storm, Sudal passed near Chuuk state in the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). One station reported 17 cm (6.68 inches) of rainfall in a 24‚Äëhour period. The passage of the storm left minor roof damage and some crop damage, due to storm surge contaminating groundwater. No deaths or injuries were reported in the state. The storm briefly threatened Guam, and as it passed south of the island, Sudal produced 5.5 m (18 ft) waves and a 0.9 m (3 ft) storm surge. A station at Apra Harbor recorded a 69 km/h (43 mph) wind gust, and light rainfall of around was reported, although no damage was reported on the island. High waves also occurred on Rota in the Northern Mariana Islands. The FSM is an independent nation in Compact of Free Association with the United States, and the latter nation is responsible for aid and protection. Further west, Typhoon Sudal intensified quickly as it moved through the Caroline Islands and later Yap state. On Ulithi, a wind gust of 132 km/h (82 mph) was reported, and 6.34 inches of rainfall occurred in a 24‚Äëhour period. High waves of over 5 m (18 ft) struck the island, causing severe beach erosion and damaging subsistence crops. The winds downed a few trees and wrecked some poorly built homes. On nearby Faraulep and Fais islands, similar meteorological conditions and damages were reported. The small Ngulu Atoll received gale-force winds and heavy rainfall, which destroyed half of the island's water storage tanks. Later in its duration, Sudal passed near Iwo Jima, producing wind gusts of 141 km/h (87 mph). =Yap= The worst of the damage occurred on the island of Yap. Initially, the typhoon was expected to pass north of the island without affecting it significantly, but instead the island experienced the brunt of the storm. Typhoon Lupit affected the island in the previous year, from which the islanders were still recovering. With the last minute change in direction, government officials rushed to complete preparations on the island. On the day before the typhoon struck, storm shelters were opened in schools and government buildings that could withstand the winds of Sudal. In anticipation of significant damage, Yap officials sent a request to the FSM government for emergency aid to clean up after the storm. A home completely destroyed by Sudal on Yap On April 9, the eye of Sudal briefly passed over the southern portion of the island, and winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) struck the island for about four hours. The entire island, only in length, experienced typhoon force winds. Yap International Airport recorded a peak wind gust of 181 km/h (112 mph); a subsequent survey estimated wind gusts on the island reached 226 km/h (140 mph). Heavy rainfall occurred during Sudal's passage, including 20.0 cm (7.88 inches) in a 48‚Äëhour period at the airport. The lowest pressure on the island was . Along the coast, the typhoon produced waves of 6.7 m (22 ft) in height, along with a 3.7 m (12 ft) storm surge; the combination sunk several ships and heavily damaged the island's coral reefs, the latter which is one of Yap's primary tourism attractions. When Typhoon Sudal struck the island, there were about 8,000 people living on Yap, with about 1,700 houses. The typhoon destroyed 700 homes, and left another 900 damaged; many of the destroyed homes were wooden. Damage was heaviest in the southeastern portion of the island, including in and around Colonia, the capital city. The strong winds downed trees across the island. Over 90% of the structures on the island were damaged or destroyed, including the hospital, airport, most government facilities, and the water, power and communications systems. One of the five hotels on the island was also destroyed. About 80% of the residents lost power or water after the storm. In the southeastern portion of the island, high waves wrecked most of the coastal homes, and also severely damaged the seawall. The intrusion of salt water destroyed almost all of the food crops on the island. Following the typhoon's passage, about 1,000 people were left homeless, and another 500 were forced to stay in shelters. Overall damage from Typhoon Sudal totaled about $14 million (2004 USD, $16.1 million 2010 USD), most of which on Yap from property damage. Despite the heavy damage, there were no deaths, although there were initial reports of one fatality. Only 8 people required hospital treatment due to injuries, none of them serious. Typhoon Sudal was the strongest typhoon to strike Yap in about 50 years. Aftermath Emergency supplies from the Federal Emergency Management Agency being unloaded from a truck to be deployed on Yap Following the passage of Sudal, officials in Yap declared a state of emergency, and a day after the typhoon struck, United States President George W. Bush ordered federal disaster aid for the FSM. The latter declaration provided funding for 75% of the debris removal cost and emergency services. Less than a week after the storm, the Pacific Islands Forum provided $11,500 to Yap for relief efforts. Over the subsequent weeks, the FSM government established a typhoon relief fund of about $250,000. Additionally, the United States government allocated $7,443,000 for relief efforts. Within a few days, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) identified primary concerns for the small island, including fixing the water supply, distributing water, clearing roads, and fixing damaged shelters. On the island, the water supply was rapidly diminishing; more than 80% of the islanders were without clean water, and the water from the treatment plant needed to be boiled for extended periods of time. Health issues included dehydration, sickness, and gastrointestinal problems. Without running water, several people bathed in the oil-contaminated harbor where many boats sunk, which caused skin irritations. Initially, telephone service onto the island was disrupted, and the only method of outside contact was by radio to the University of Guam. The Guam Memorial Hospital dropped a package of medical supplies to Yap, although planes containing aid flying onto the island were disrupted by the damaged runway. About a day after Sudal's passage, the runway was cleared and repaired, which allowed a United States Coast Guard plane to provide relief supplies, including building materials. By April 12, or three days after the typhoon, communication links to the island began to be restored. By four days later, the water treatment plant was repaired. One power station on the island was repaired, but since the strong winds damaged most of the power lines, about 85% of the population remained without electricity. Primary roadways were largely cleared, and all bridges were reopened. Homes and businesses were destroyed across Yap when Typhoon Sudal sent high winds and waters ashore. About two weeks after the typhoon's passage, there were still 500 people in 18 shelters in Colonia, the capital city, as well as about 400 people in shelters elsewhere. Many others were either residing with relatives or staying at their damaged properties. The United States Army Corps of Engineers arrived on Yap to coordinate debris removal and installing generators. Officials sent 23 flights of aid to the island, as well as one each to the outlying islands of Ulithi and Fais. About 76,000 litres (20,000 gallons) of water were sent to the island, and five large water tanks were installed. Members of the United States Forest Service arrived to coordinate the receiving and distribution of relief supplies. The Yap hospital was poorly suited to handle the typhoon, due to the lack of medications or emergency medical equipment. About 60 FEMA personnel worked at the hospital, who required additional items, such as their own supply of water and food, to prevent them from acquiring local diseases. During their stay on the island, the group assisted 163 people, mostly for minor issues. Overall, there were about 100 FEMA workers involved on the island, although only 20 stayed there due to lack of hotels and rental cars. By 26 days after the storm, more than half of the island had power restored, and the cell phone system was fixed. In the weeks and months after the passage of Sudal, water temperatures around Yap decreased from to , due to significant upwelling. The drastic decrease caused unusual amounts of fog over the island, as well as significantly lower tides. By September 2004, rebuilding was still underway, and half of the schools, which had previously been used as shelters, reopened to students. Power and water lines were completely restored. The hospital remained damaged with a temporary roof, and although private businesses quickly re-opened, government buildings took longer to be rebuilt; this was due to the lengthy process of receiving aid from FEMA. Additionally, officials required a land survey to determine where structures were safe to be rebuilt. Due to the heavy damage on Yap, the name Sudal was retired during the 38th session of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and World Meteorological Organization typhoon committee in November 2005; it was replaced with the name Mirinae.

He displayed excellent qualities of leadership in adversity and paved the way for later generations of native Fijian missionaries in spreading Christianity to other parts of Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Life The mission to New Britain was launched in August 1875, just forty years after the first Wesleyan missionaries Cargill and Cross brought Christianity to Fiji's shores in 1835. Just months after the tragic measles epidemic which killed 40,000 in Fiji, Reverend George Brown the Methodist missionary, appealed to the students of Navuloa Methodist Mission School, to embark on spreading the Christian gospel to their Melanesian brethren. Reverend George Brown, emphasized to the zealous native Fijian converts the dangers involved in missionary work and pointed out that they might well be going to their deaths. Eighty three students who attended the mission school were present and heard Brown's appeal. They were cautioned to consult with their wives and families in deciding to volunteer for the mission. It is recorded in the Fiji Methodist Church which was then governed by the New South Wales Australia Wesleyan synod, that the whole student body as enrolled at Navuloa, offered to go and spread the faith. The colonial government of the day was not keen on the mounting of the mission, most probably wanting to limit out-migration of natives as the population had been devastated by the measles epidemic earlier that year. A hand picked few were finally chosen by Brown and cleared by the colonial government. They left the shores of Fiji, true to their evangelical calling some never to return. By 1876 the new mission field in New Guinea which originally consisted of fourteen teacher's stations had been divided into two areas, one under Rev. Baledrokadroka and the other under Rev.Sailasa Naucukidi. Martyrdom In the year 1878, Reverend Sailasa Naucukidi journeyed inland from the northern coast of New Britain with a small party preaching the Gospel. On 6 April at Tanaka, Reverend Naucukidi was suddenly attacked and slain, and his body dismembered and cannibalized. Consequently, three other Fijian missionaries; Reverend Livai Naboro, Reverend Peni Luvu and Layman Timoci Baravi were slain at Talakua in what is now Tungnaparau. Rev Luvu managed to break free from the ambush after he defended himself with a club he grabbed from one of the attackers. He sadly did not reach his Vunela home as he was met along the way by Chief Talili who after offering him a kalau, beheaded him while he was taking a drink.The National, 'Vunela- Where Fijian Missionaries were slain' ,p.39 ,Fri 01 Apr 2016. After the tragedy the remains of the missionaries were later repossessed by Rev. Dr. George Brown, who with local converts carried out retaliatory actions for the murders. At the end of a six-day campaign those responsible for the killings and cannibalizing of the Fijian missionaries surrendered. The accounts of Aminio Baledrokadroka's deep faith and tales of his miraculous deeds are legendary in the Methodist Church of Fiji. He and his wife Lavenia Tupou returned to Fiji in 1885. He finally retired to his village, in Nasaqalau, Lakeba, Lau where he lies buried. Reverend Aminio Baledrokadroka and his fellow Fijian missionaries proselytization legacy and martyrdom is today honored in Kabakada village and the Province of East New Britain. A memorial monument was erected on top of the buried remains of the four slain martyrs on Vunela hilltop on 15 August 1975, the one hundredth anniversary of the arrival of the Fijian missionaries in the New Guinea islands. The burial site now known as the Fijian Cemetery holds 41 graves which are now part of the Vunela historical tourism site.

It was established by a religious brotherhood founded by Hern√°n Cort√©s. The parish church was originally built in 1586, but this building was replaced in the 18th century to the one standing today. The former monastery building and hospital now house the Franz Mayer Museum, but the church still maintains its original function. Most of its interior decorations are gone, but it is still home to two important images, the Christ of the Seven Veils and the Virgin of the Remedies (also called La Gachupina). The church is located on the east side of the Plaza of Santa Veracruz, between 2 de Abril and Valeriano Trijillo Streets facing Hidalgo Street and the Alameda Central . History Shortly after the Conquest, Hern√°n Cort√©s founded the Archicofrad√≠a de la Cruz as an act of gratitude for the successful arrival of the Spanish on the American mainland. The Brotherhood was named after the Good Friday of 1519, or Day of the True Cross, when Cort√©s landed in Veracruz . The original members were conquistadors. Later, memberships were restricted to aristocrats and others with noble titles, but eventually membership was open to anyone with sufficient money and clout. Those who belonged to the organization wore a large red cross on their chest and a crucifix with an image of the Christ of the Seven Veils on two small tablets with the Ten Commandments. The members‚Äô main duty was to accompany prisoners to jail and those condemned to death to the gallows. They also paid the funeral and burial expenses for these prisoners as well. To the common people, this brotherhood was known as the ‚ÄúKnights of the (straw)Mats‚Äù as the prisoners were buried in the cheapest way possible. Side portal of the church This brotherhood requested lands on which to build a church and hospital. The land they received in 1527 was several blocks on what was then called Tlacopan Street. This location was just west of the original Spanish city and just into the neighborhood of Santa Mar√≠a Cuepopan, which was originally set aside for the indigent. It was next to the Tlaxpana Aqueduct and near the La Mariscala fountain, both of which no longer exist. Originally, a small hermitage was built on the site, in the 1520s, making the church one of the oldest in the region. In 1586, a parish church was built, which would become the third most important in the city by the end of the 16th century. It is said that the church was one of the Chapels of the Stations of the Cross, functioning as Station #7. This set of churches began with the church of the monastery of San Francisco. Other brotherhoods which were headquartered here was the Brotherhood of the Most Holy Sacrament (Cofrad√≠a del Sant√≠simo Sacramento), Brotherhood of the Slaves of the Most Holy (Cofrad√≠a de Esclavos del Sant√≠smo), and Brotherhood of the Tears of Saint Peter (Cofrad√≠a de las L√°grimas de San Pedro). The passage of time, along with damage from sinking subsoil, earthquakes, and flooding in the 16th to 18th century, made the church's reconstruction necessary. The original structures were demolished and replaced. Construction on the new and current buildings began in 1759 and were finished in 1776, when the towers and the side facade were completed. Saint Blas was declared the patron saint of both the church and the Brotherhood that sponsored it. During this construction period in 1768, there was a major earthquake in Mexico City, prompting the use of the church's atrium for a mass funeral for 488 people. Originally the interior of the church was rich and ostentatious, with Baroque altarpieces made of precious hardwoods and covered in gold leaf. At the beginning of the 20th century, these were destroyed. All that remains of the original decoration are small marks of the decorative elements and the silverwork in the vault. It is currently being remodeled by the Instituto Nacional de Antropolog√≠a e Historia. The building Interior Christ of the Seven Veils The building has facades on the west, south and east sides, with the south facade, facing Hidalgo Street, as the main one. These facades are covered in tezontle and gray sandstone (cantera) with two elaborately decorated Mexican Baroque or Churrigueresque portals. The portal on the main facade has two levels, with entrance through a rounded arch flanked by pilasters with inverted, elongated, truncated pyramid shapes called estipites. The second level has two pairs of estipites, with a simple cross, a large choral window, and three pyramid-shaped pinnacles. At the top of the facade is a sculpture of Saint Joseph. The side portal is richer than the main one. Access is through a rounded arch flanked by two estipites. It consists of a rounded arch with raised decorative features, flanked by two pilasters decorated with plants motifs, cherubs, and the faces of saints. One aspect of this decoration that stands out are two angels carrying flowers. These flowers carry over to the pediment, which also bears an inscription referring completion of the towers and the side portal. The upper level of the facade is marked by estipite pilasters. Between them is a richly decorated niche with an image of Saint Blas. Above this is a medallion with a cross, and above the cross is an image of the Archangel Michael. Next door is the priest's quarters, constructed by Lorenzo Rodriquez, who was the architect of the Metropolitan Tabernacle. The old monastery and Hospital de San Juan de Dios are now the Franz Mayer Museum. These buildings, along with the church, frame the Plaza de Santa Veracruz. The building has one nave, with a layout of a Latin cross. The nave is covered in vaults of several different types with some containing images of cherubs done in relief. The cupola has eight sides and a raised area with windows (linternilla). The main nave contains the painting Virgin of Guadalupe before the Holy Trinity from the 18th century, and three works from the 19th century called The Baptism of Jesus, The Divine Providence, and The Virgin at the Foot of the Cross. There are also images of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and Saint Blas. In the south bell tower there is a dramatic image of Christ the Nazarene which is dated to the 18th century. The north side has two large chapels. One is dedicated to the Se√±or de la Salud (Lord of Health) and the Se√±or del Santo Entierro (Lord of the Holy Burial). This chapel also serves as the church's baptistery with a fount containing an image of the Holy Lamb. The other is called the Chapel of the Holy Cross. It contains a Baroque altarpiece that features images of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Saint Peter, Saint Paul, and the archangels Michael and Gabriel. This altarpiece is said to contain a splinter of the original cross of Jesus, donated in 1968 by Cardinal Miguel Dar√≠o Miranda y G√≥mez of Mexico and previously authenticated by the Vatican in 1967. The chapel is adorned with hand-painted tiles with contains scenes from the life of missionary Francisco Xavier done by Miguel Cabrera. In the apse, in a simple niche, is the Christ of the Seven Veils, done in cornstalk paste in the 16th century, accompanied by images of the Virgin of the Sorrows and John the Baptist. According to tradition, it was given to Carlos V from Pope Paul III. Carlos V then awarded it to the Brotherhood. It was also believed that those permitted to remove the veils and see the image underneath were rewarded with indulgences. Another important image here is the Virgin of the Remedies (Virgen de los Remedios), which is also known as La Gachupina. Gachupin is a derogatory term for Spaniard. She received the term as she was the patron of the Spanish in Mexico. The Virgin originally had her own sanctuary but was brought here to ask for rain during a dry period, and never left. The remains of Manuel Tols√°, the architect responsible for a number of the city center's iconic buildings, were buried here since he died in 1816. Historical facts In this parish was buried the famous architect and sculptor Manuel Tols√°, who was a neighbor and assistant to this church.

It was first named by paleontologists Jeremy A. Martin and Komsorn Lauprasert in 2010, and the type species is K. siamogallicus. Fossils have been found from the Krabi Basin of southern Thailand and include mostly cranial and mandibular elements as well as some postcranial remains. Krabisuchus is currently the most well known primitive alligatorine from Asia; previously, these animals were only represented in Asia by a few fragmentary remains from China. The fossil record of alligatorines is much more extensive in Europe and North America, where most taxa have been described. Growing to approximately in length, Krabisuchus was a small alligatorine that was much smaller than the living alligator. Like the alligator, it had a blunt snout. Krabisuchus also had a raised skull similar to the extinct alligatorine Arambourgia and living crocodile Osteolaemus tetraspis. The teeth at the back of the jaws were very blunt. It, like other extinct alligatorines, was probably terrestrial rather than semiaquatic. This terrestrial lifestyle may have allowed other alligatorines to colonize much of the northern hemisphere during the Paleogene when global temperatures were much warmer than they are today. Krabisuchus is closely related to the extinct alligatorines Arambourgia, Allognathosuchus, and Procaimanoidea. These taxa are considered sister groups of the Alligator clade.

The middle child of a land surveyor, he grew up with a younger brother and an older sister in Hanover and, from 1907, in Berlin. He encountered the teachings of Rudolf Steiner as a schoolchild. From that moment on, Anthroposophy, a movement for which he would remain active in many contexts, became a constant companion in his life. From 1914 he studied Painting and Music in Munich; 1916 he was drafted into the military. After 1918, his \\"Wanderjahre\\" took him to G√∂ttingen, where he married in 1920, Jena, Hamburg, Cologne and finally back to Berlin in 1930. Following primarily private musical studies, he became a freelance composer and music critic. Between 1930 and 1934 he took over editing the Allgemeine Musikzeitung, combining this activity with contributions to the Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger. Following the National Socialists arrival in power, he became a staff music writer at the Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger until 1944. In 1934, he expressed agreement with nationalist socialist cultural policy with regards to the \\"Neue Musik\\" (new music), which he described as a \\"Rotting bacillus, deliberately and calculatedly inoculated into the cultural body [...]\\" In 1939 he wrote an antisemitic article for the magazine Deutsches Volkstum in which he described the Jewish people's intellectuality as \\"mere means to the end of exerting power\\" and \\"effective method of decomposition, an explosive for splitting the dominated people into powerless classes\\". After the war, Abendroth's work was examined by the Allied Control Council during the so-called Denazification processes. He was deemed to be a german-nationalist antisemite rather than a nationalist-socialist one and as such given 'employable' status. Abendroth moved to Hamburg with his second wife Hilde, n√©e Schlegl, working as features editor for the national newspaper Die Zeit from 1948 until 1955, when he moved to Munich, working freelance as cultural correspondent. He is noted in particular as biographer (1935) and publisher of the composer, conductor and author Hans Pfitzner's works. Artistic Creation In addition to his activities as a music journalist and writer, Abendroth composed five symphonies, as well as a variety of concerts, songs and chamber music. In his compositional work, he endeavoured to develop the traditional forms of music and to combine them with the musical styles of the 20th century.

She was originally laid down for the Imperial Russian Navy as the corvette Witjas, however was confiscated during the Crimean War in 1854. On 28 October 1854, she ran aground on the Draystone Rock, off Sheerness, Kent. Her captain was severely reprimanded at the ensuing court-martial.

Her next posting was on Cape of Good Hope Station, she transported Sir George Grey to his posting as Governor of New Zealand in 1861. She was later sent to China Station before joining the Australia Station in September 1871. In June 1872 the new town for Port Walcott on Western Australia's northwest coast was named Cossack to commemorate a visit in December 1871 with the colonial Governor of Western Australia Sir Frederick Weld on board. She left the Australia Station in 1873 and sailed for England. She was sold to Castle for breaking up at Charlton in May 1875.

It is native to the mountains of Oregon and California, where it grows in many types of woodland and forest habitat, often in moist areas. Description Silene lemmonii is a perennial herb producing several stems and shoots from a woody, branching caudex. The decumbent or erect stems may be up to 45 centimeters long and are hairy, the hairs on the upper parts glandular. Most of the leaves are located low on the plant and are oval to lance-shaped, measuring a few centimeters in length; smaller leaves may occur on the upper stem. The inflorescence bears 1 to 7 nodding flowers on sticky glandular stalks. The moth-pollinated flower has a tubular or inflated calyx of fused sepals open at the tip to reveal five petals.

Similar bills were introduced in several U.S. Congresses before its passage in 2010, and courts had also acted to reduce the sentencing disparity prior to the bill's passage. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 implemented the initial disparity, reflecting Congress's view that crack cocaine was a more dangerous and harmful drug than powder cocaine. In the decades since, extensive research by the United States Sentencing Commission and other experts has suggested that the differences between the effects of the two drugs are exaggerated and that the sentencing disparity is unwarranted. Further controversy surrounding the 100:1 ratio was a result of its description by some as being racially biased and contributing to a disproportionate number of African Americans being sentenced for crack cocaine offenses. Legislation to reduce the disparity has been introduced since the mid-1990s, culminating in the signing of the Fair Sentencing Act. The Act has been described as improving the fairness of the federal criminal justice system, and prominent politicians and non-profit organizations have called for further reforms, such as making the law retroactive and complete elimination of the disparity (i.e., enacting a 1:1 sentencing ratio). Background The use of crack cocaine increased rapidly in the 1980s, accompanied by an increase in violence in urban areas. In response, the Anti- Drug Abuse Act of 1986 included a provision that created the disparity between federal penalties for crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses, imposing the same penalties for the possession of an amount of crack cocaine as for 100 times the same amount of powder cocaine. The law also contained minimum sentences and other disparities between the two forms of the drug.Durbin's Fair Sentencing Act Passed By House, Sent to President for Signature, durbin.senate.gov, accessed September 30, 2010. =Sentencing disparity and effects= In the three decades prior to the passing of the Fair Sentencing Act, those who were arrested for possessing crack cocaine faced much more severe penalties than those in possession of powder cocaine. While a person found with five grams of crack cocaine faced a five-year mandatory minimum prison sentence, a person holding powder cocaine could receive the same sentence only if he or she held five hundred grams. Similarly, those carrying ten grams of crack cocaine faced a ten-year mandatory sentence, while possession of one thousand grams of powder cocaine was required for the same sentence to be imposed.The Fair Sentencing Act corrects a long-time wrong in cocaine cases, The Washington Post, August 3, 2010, accessed September 30, 2010. At that time, Congress provided the following five reasons for the high ratio: crack cocaine was more addictive than powder cocaine; crack cocaine was associated with violent crime; youth were more likely to be drawn to crack cocaine; crack cocaine was inexpensive, and therefore more likely to be consumed in large quantities; and use of crack cocaine by pregnant mothers was dangerous for their unborn children.Beaver, Alyssa L. Getting a Fix on Cocaine Sentencing Policy: Reforming the Sentencing Scheme of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986,Fordham Law Review, vol. 78, April 2010, accessed October 14, 2010. A study released in 1997 examined the addictive nature of both crack and powder cocaine and concluded that one was no more addictive than the other. The study explored other reasons why crack is viewed as more addictive and theorized, \\"a more accurate interpretation of existing evidence is that already abuse-prone cocaine users are most likely to move toward a more efficient mode of ingestion as they escalate their use. The Los Angeles Times commented, \\"There was never any scientific basis for the disparity, just panic as the crack epidemic swept the nation's cities.\\" Cocaine powder The sentencing disparity between these two drug offenses is perceived by a number of commentators as racially biased. In 1995, the U.S. Sentencing Commission concluded that the disparity created a \\"racial imbalance in federal prisons and led to more severe sentences for low-level crack dealers than for wholesale suppliers of powder cocaine. ... As a result, thousands of people ‚Äì mostly African Americans ‚Äì have received disproportionately harsh prison sentences.\\"Effectiveness of the War on Drugs, Drug Policy Alliance, accessed October 17, 2010. In 2002, the United States Sentencing Commission \\"found that the ratio was created based upon a misperception of the dangers of crack cocaine, which had since been proven to have a less drastic effect than previously thought.\\" In 2009, the U.S. Sentencing Commission introduced figures stating that no class of drug is as racially skewed as crack in terms of numbers of offenses. According to the data, 79% of 5,669 sentenced crack offenders were black, while only 10% were white and 10% were Hispanic. The figures for the 6,020 powder cocaine convictions, in contrast, were as follows: 17% of these offenders were white, 28% were black, and 53% were Hispanic. Combined with a 115-month average imprisonment for crack offenses, compared with an average of 87 months for cocaine offenses, the sentencing disparity results in more African-Americans spending more time in the prison system. Asa Hutchinson, the former administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration under President George W. Bush, commented that because of the disparate treatment of these two offenses, \\"the credibility of our entire drug enforcement system is weakened.\\" The U.S. Sentencing Commission also released a statement saying that \\"perceived improper racial disparity fosters disrespect for and lack of confidence in the criminal justice system.\\" According to U.S. Senator Dick Durbin, \\"The sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine has contributed to the imprisonment of African Americans at six times the rate of Whites and to the United States' position as the world's leader in incarcerations.\\" =Attempts to change the disparity= Legal challenges Although the 100:1 federal sentencing ratio remained unchanged from 1986 to 2010, two U.S. Supreme Court cases provided lower courts with discretion in determining penalties for cocaine convictions. Kimbrough v. United States (2007) and Spears v. United States gave lower courts the option to set penalties and allowed judges who disagreed with the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to depart from the statutory ratio based on policy concerns. In 2009, the U.S. District Courts for the Western District of Pennsylvania, Western District of Virginia and District of Columbia used these cases to create one-to-one sentencing ratios of crack cocaine to powder cocaine. United States v. Booker (2005) and Blakely v. Washington (2004) also weakened the sentencing guidelines as a whole by making them advisory. Proposed legislation The U.S. Sentencing Commission first called for reform of the 100:1 sentencing disparity in 1994 after a year-long study on the differing penalties for powder and crack cocaine required by the Omnibus Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. The Commission found that the sentencing disparity was unjustified due to the small differences between the two forms of cocaine, and advised Congress to equalize the quantity ratio that would trigger mandatory sentences. Congress rejected the Commission's recommendations for the first time in the Commission's history.\\"Federal Crack Cocaine Sentencing\\" , The Sentencing Project, sentencingproject.org, accessed October 24, 2010. In April 1997, the Commission again recommended a reduction in the disparity, providing Congress with a range from 2:1 to 15:1 to choose from. This recommendation would have raised the quantity of crack and lowered the quantity of powder cocaine required to trigger a mandatory minimum sentence. Congress did not act on this recommendation. In 2002, the Commission again called for reducing sentencing disparities in its Report to Congress based on extensive research and testimony by medical and scientific professionals, federal and local law enforcement officials, criminal justice practitioners, academics, and civil rights organizations. Congress first proposed bipartisan legislation to reform crack cocaine sentencing in 2001, when Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) introduced the Drug Sentencing Reform Act. This proposal would have raised the amount of crack cocaine necessary for a five-year mandatory minimum from 5 grams to 20 grams and would have lowered the amount of powder cocaine necessary for the same sentence from 500 grams to 400 grams, a 20:1 ratio. During the 110th United States Congress, seven crack cocaine sentencing reform bills were introduced that would have reduced the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses without increasing mandatory sentences. In the Senate, Orrin Hatch (R-UT) sponsored the Fairness in Drug Sentencing Act of 2007 (S. 1685) that would have created a 20:1 ratio by increasing the five-year quantity trigger for mandatory minimum sentences for crack cocaine to 25 grams and leaving the powder cocaine level at 500 grams.S. 1685: Fairness in Drug Sentencing Act of 2007, govtrack.us, accessed October 27, 2010. Former senator and former Vice President of the United States Joe Biden sponsored the Drug Sentencing Reform and Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007 (S. 1711), which would have completely eliminated the disparity by increasing the amount of crack cocaine required for the imposition of mandatory minimum prison terms to those of powder cocaine.S. 1711: Drug Sentencing Reform and Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007, govtrack.us, accessed October 27, 2010. Both of these bills would have eliminated the five-year mandatory minimum prison term for first-time possession of crack cocaine. In the House of Representatives, Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) sponsored the Drug Sentencing Reform and Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007 (H.R. 4545), the companion to Biden's proposed bill.H.R.4545: Drug Sentencing Reform and Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007, govtrack.us, accessed October 27, 2010. Charles Rangel sponsored the Crack-Cocaine Equitable Sentencing Act of 2007 (H.R. 460), a bill he had been introducing since the mid-1990s that would have equalized cocaine sentencing and eliminated specified mandatory minimum penalties relating to the trafficking in, and possession, importation, or distribution of, crack cocaine.H.R.460: Crack-Cocaine Equitable Sentencing Act of 2007, govtrack.us, accessed October 27, 2010. The FIRST STEP Act, passed in December 2018, retroactively applied the Fair Sentencing Act, aiding around 2,600 imprisoned people. Opposition to the Act Some members of Congress opposed the Act. Lamar S. Smith (R-TX), the top-ranking Republican on the United States House Committee on the Judiciary, argued against its passage stating, \\"I cannot support legislation that might enable the violent and devastating crack cocaine epidemic of the past to become a clear and present danger.\\"\\"Project Vote Smart-Fair Sentencing Act of 2010\\". Votesmart.og, accessed December 13, 2010. Specifically, Smith alleged that because \\"reducing the penalties for crack cocaine could expose our neighborhoods to the same violence and addiction that caused Congress to act in the first place,\\"House Passes Bill to Reduce Disparity in Cocaine Penalties. CNN.com, accessed December 13, 2010. the bill risked a return to the crack cocaine epidemic that \\"ravaged our communities, especially minority communities.\\"Rep.

Smith claimed that the severe sentences for crack cocaine were justified by a high correlation between crack cocaine arrests and both violent crime and past criminal history. The Fraternal Order of Police, a national organization of law enforcement officers, also opposed the Act.Legislation Opposed by the National Fraternal Order of Police . Fraternal Order of Police website, accessed December 12, 2010 It argued that because increased violence is associated with the use of crack, especially in urban areas, high penalties for crack-related offenses were justified, relying on U.S. Sentencing Commission statistics showing that 29% of all crack cases from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009, involved a weapon, compared to only 16% for powder cocaine. The organization also stated that the enhanced penalties for crack cocaine \\"have proven useful, and a better course of action would have been to instead raise the penalties for powder cocaine crimes.\\" The Fair Sentencing Act includes a provision to account for such aggravated cases, allowing penalties to be increased for the use of violence during a drug trafficking offense. The National Sheriffs' Association (NSA) opposed the bill, stating that \\"Both crack and powder cocaine are dangerous narcotics and plights on communities throughout the United States. ... NSA would consider supporting legislation that would increase the sentence for powder cocaine, rather than significantly reducing the sentence for crack cocaine.\\"National Sheriff's Association, 2010 Legislative Priorities. National Sheriff's Association, January 12, 2010, accessed December 6, 2010 Proposal and passage of the bill President Barack Obama at the signing ceremony for the Act. On July 29, 2009, the United States House Committee on the Judiciary passed proposed legislation, the Fairness in Cocaine Sentencing Act (H.R.3245), a bill sponsored by Bobby Scott. Co-sponsored by a group of 62 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, including Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul, the bill would have completely eliminated the sentencing disparity.\\"Ron Paul's Statement on the Fair Sentencing Act\\" The Fair Sentencing Act was introduced as compromise legislation to get bipartisan and unanimous support, amended to merely reduce the 100:1 disparity to 18:1. The Fair Sentencing Act (S. 1789) was authored by Assistant Senate Majority Leader Dick Durbin (D-IL) and cosponsored by Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and ranking member Jeff Sessions (R-AL). The bill passed the U.S. Senate on March 17, 2010 and passed the U.S. House of Representatives on July 27, 2010, with House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-SC) and Bobby Scott (D-VA) as key supporters. The bill was then sent to President Obama and signed into law on August 3, 2010.S. 1789: Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, govtrack.us, accessed September 29, 2010. Key provisions The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 amended the Controlled Substances Act and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act by increasing the amount of a controlled substance or mixture containing a cocaine base (i.e., crack cocaine) that would result in mandatory minimum prison terms for trafficking and by increasing monetary penalties for drug trafficking and for importing/exporting controlled substances. The five-year mandatory minimum for first-time possession of crack cocaine was also eliminated,Bill Summary & Status - 111th Congress (2009‚Äì2010) - S.1789 - CRS Summary, thomas.loc.gov, accessed October 10, 2010. and sentencing may take account of accompanying violence, among other aggravating factors. The bill directed the United States Sentencing Commission to take four actions: *review and amend its sentencing guidelines to increase sentences for those convicted of committing violent acts in the course a drug trafficking offense; *incorporate aggravating and mitigating factors in its guidelines for drug trafficking offenses; *announce all guidelines, policy statements, and amendments required by the act no later than 90 days after its enactment; and *study and report to Congress on the impact of changes in sentencing law under this act. In addition, the bill requires the Comptroller General to report to Congress with an analysis of the effectiveness of drug court programs under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. This must be done within one year after the enactment of the Fair Sentencing Act. Impact and reception The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that implementing the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 will reduce the prison population by 1,550 person-years over the time period from 2011‚Äì2015, creating a monetary savings of $42 million during that period.Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate, cbo.gov, accessed September 30, 2010. The CBO also estimates that the Act's requirement for the Government Accountability Office to conduct a report on the effectiveness of a Department of Justice grant program to treat nonviolent drug offenders would cost less than $500,000 from appropriated funds. On October 15, 2010, the U.S. Sentencing Commission voted 6-1 to approve a temporary amendment to federal sentencing guidelines to reflect the changes made by the Fair Sentencing Act.\\"Crack, powder cocaine sentence guidelines adjusted\\", The Washington Post, October 15, 2010, accessed October 24, 2010. The Commission changed the sentencing guidelines to reflect Congress's increasing the amount of crack cocaine that would trigger a five-year mandatory minimum sentence from 5 grams to 28 grams (one ounce) and the amount that would trigger a ten-year mandatory minimum from 50 grams to 280 grams. The amendment also lists aggravating factors to the guidelines, creating harsher sentences for crack cocaine offenses involving violence or bribery of law enforcement officials. The Commission made the amendment permanent on June 30, 2011.\\"US Sentencing Commission Implements Crack Law\\" , Families Against Mandatory Minimums, famm.org, accessed October 24, 2010. Effective November 1, 2011, the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 applies retroactively to reduce the sentences of certain offenders already sentenced for federal crack cocaine offenses before the passage of the bill. However, the nonprofit organization Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a major advocate of the Fair Sentencing Act, has lobbied Congress to make the entire act retroactive. According to Gil Kerlikowske, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, \\"there is no scientific basis for the disparity and by promoting laws and policies that treat all Americans equally, and by working to amend or end those that do not, we can only increase public confidence in the criminal justice system and help create a safer and healthier nation for us all.\\"\\"Congress OKs Fair Sentencing Act\\". United Press International, July 28, 2010, accessed December 5, 2010. Progressives argue for elimination of the sentencing disparity altogether and believe that the impact of the bill on racial disparities in drug enforcement may be limited for several reasons. First, while the bill reduces the ratio between crack and powder cocaine sentencing, it does not achieve full parity. Second, the Act does not address the enforcement prerogatives of federal criminal justice agencies: while African-American defendants account for roughly 80% of those arrested for crack-related offenses, public health data has found that two-thirds of crack users are white or Hispanic.Morris, Antoine. \\"House Could Consider Legislation This Week to Reduce Crack and Cocaine Sentencing Disparity\\" , Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, civilrights.org, July 27, 2010, accessed December 14, 2010. Third, the Act does not reduce sentences for those prosecuted under state law, and state prosecutions account for a vast majority of incarcerations for drug-related offenses.Kelly, John. \\"Congress Passes Law to Reduce Crack/Cocaine Sentencing Disparities\\" .

An arranged marriage to Hill‚Äôs cousin Edgar Hill allowed Sam B. to be raised as legitimate and be legally a member of his father‚Äôs family. Hill was clearly the love of her life, although Bell had two brief marriages, one to a dentist and one to a doctor. Sam Hill had other lovers, and before Sam B. was born had two other children outside his marriage by two different woman.. Eminent domain battle and afterward Three years after his death the house Sam Hill gave Bell was demolished for the construction of the Bonneville Dam. When the U.S. government seized Bell‚Äôs property for the Bonneville Dam project in 1933, they offered her $25,000 ($ today). She went to court, and in 1935 received $72,500 plus interest ($78,661 total, or $ million today). Later career and adventures In her 20s and 30s Mona Bell had a career as a reporter for various newspapers around the United States, including in San Francisco, where she became the first female crime reporter in the country. Some time before 1926 she swam the frigid Strait of Juan de Fuca, an achievement possibly exceeding Gertrude Ederle's famed 1926 feat of swimming the English Channel. After winning the eminent domain case Bell and 7 year-old Sam B. made a two- year round-the-world voyage that included six months in Africa. She then moved back to Minnesota where she raised her son. In 1953 Bell moved from Minnesota to Riverside, California. Like her earlier home on the Columbia, she was renowned in Minnesota and Riverside for her elaborate gardens. Bell died in 1981 at age 91\\\\. See also * Sam Hill Further reading * A Woman Alone: Mona Bell, Sam Hill and the Mansion on Bonneville Rock by John A.

Born into slavery in St. Augustine, Florida, as a young man he served as a valet to Edmund Kirby Smith, the son of his owner, Judge Joseph Lee Smith. Darnes accompanied Smith to Texas while he served in the United States Army. During the Civil War, Smith commanded as a Confederate general. After the war and emancipation of slaves, Darnes gained an education, aided by Frances Smith Webster, Kirby Smith's older sister. Darnes earned his undergraduate degree at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania and a medical degree from Howard University in 1880. He returned to Florida, settling in Jacksonville, where he set up a practice. In 1888 Darnes served residents during a terrible yellow fever epidemic, when half the population fled the city. Darnes was well respected, an officer of the Freemasons, and a member of the Mount Zion AME Church. Some 3,000 people, both black and white, attended his funeral, the largest in city history up to that time. In 2004 a statue, Sons of the City, was erected at the Sequi-Kirby Smith House, showing both Darnes and Kirby Smith as adults in later life: Darnes the doctor and Smith the professor. It was the first piece of public art in the city to honor an African American. Early life and education Alexander H. Darnes was born into slavery in St. Augustine, Florida. Of mixed race, he was the son of Violet Pinkney, a domestic servant in the household, and an unnamed father. He and his mother were owned by Joseph Lee Smith, a judge, and Frances Kirby Smith, at what is now known as the Segui-Kirby Smith House at 12 Aviles Street. Photos held by the St. Augustine Historical Society show Darnes and his later owner Edmund Kirby Smith, the youngest son of the Smith household, who became a Confederate general. Maria Juliana Kirby-Smith, great-granddaughter of Smith and the sculptor who created a 2004 statue of the two men, said that she believes Darnes was related to Smith as a half-brother or nephew. Her study of their photos and detailed work on the statues made her aware of the two men's close physical resemblance. In 1855 at about the age of 15, Darnes was assigned to Edmund Kirby Smith as his personal valet; the youngest son in the family, Smith was 16 years older and by then a captain in the United States Army. Darnes accompanied Smith on tours in the western territories and continued to serve him during the Civil War, when Smith was a general for the Confederacy. After the South's defeat and the emancipation of slaves, Darnes gained an education. (He was financially helped by Frances Smith Webster, an older sister of General Kirby Smith. She was the widow of Lucien Bonaparte Webster, a US Army officer from Vermont who had died in 1853. Born in Connecticut, Smith Webster retained her loyalty to the Union during the Civil War.) After preparatory work, Darnes attended Lincoln University, a historically black college founded in 1854 in Pennsylvania. Darnes went to medical school at Howard University, a black college founded soon after the Civil War in Washington, D.C. He graduated in 1880 with a medical degree. Career Darnes returned to Florida after medical school and settled in Jacksonville, where he set up a private medical practice. He was the first black physician in the city and the second in the state. Darnes built a thriving practice operated out of his home on Ocean Street and became a pillar of the community. He won praise for his work during the smallpox and yellow fever epidemics that swept Jacksonville in the late 19th century. These included the devastating yellow fever epidemic of 1887-1888 that swept the South, reaching Jacksonville in the summer of 1888. Not understanding how the disease was transmitted, almost everyone who could afford to fled the city - roughly half the city's population of 25,000. Darnes stayed to help those who remained as best he could. He was assisted by his friend and fellow Howard Medical School alumnus, Dr. Lemuel W. Livingston. Darnes was accepted into the Freemasons, became a member of the local Masonic Temple, and rose to a position of prominence. He became the Florida Deputy Grand Master and High Priest of the Royal Arch Chapter of Washington, D.C. He also was a member of the Mt. Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), the first independent black denomination in the United States. It was established by free blacks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the early 19th century. In Jacksonville, Darnes became a friend and mentor to the young James Weldon Johnson, who was 10 when they met, and his brother John Rosamond Johnson. The brothers later collaborated to write and compose \\"Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing\\", known as \\"The Negro National Anthem.\\" In his autobiography Along This Way, James Weldon Johnson fondly refers to Darnes. Darnes died in February 1894. According to the obituary in local paper, 3,000 people, both black and white, attended his funeral, more than for any other funeral ever held in Jacksonville up to that time. Legacy and honors *1894, Darnes' large funeral was attended by more than 3,000 black and white citizens of Jacksonville. Obituaries of him were published by more than one local paper. *2004, Sons of the City, a life-size bronze sculpture of Smith and Darnes, was created by artist Maria Juliana Kirby- Smith, a great-granddaughter of General Edmund Kirby Smith. The sculpture portrays the two men as adults; Darnes' medical bag is shown beside him. The work was installed in the courtyard garden of the Segui-Kirby Smith House in St. Augustine. The house is now used by the St. Augustine Historical Society as its Research Library.

In addition, he learned from his father, who operated a local paper mill, the art of paper production. After the apprenticeship Voelter went to Bautzen to continue and complete his studies of paper manufacturing. While in Saxony, he met Friedrich Gottlob Keller (1816‚Äì1895), from whom he took over an 1846 patent for manufacturing paper from wood fiber mash. He further developed the method such that mass production of paper from wood became possible - until then, paper had been produced from rags. He returned to his hometown after his father's death in 1848, where he benefited from the help of Johan Matth√§us Voith (1803‚Äì1874), who in 1852 constructed two grindstones for the Voelter paper mill.

Built about 1795, it is a high quality local example of late Colonial architecture, with a history of ownership by members of prominent local families. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Barnes-Frost House is located on the west side of Marion Avenue, north of its junction with Old Mountain Road (Connecticut Route 322). It is a -story wood-frame structure, five bays wide, with a clapboarded exterior, side gable roof, large central chimney, and a centered entrance. The entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by a frieze with a band of molded ellipses. This detail is repeated on the window lintels and in a frieze band below the roof line. The chimney is not original to the house, but is an 18th-century structure recovered from a house in Cheshire. The interior retains some original features, notably wide pine floors. and Built c. 1796, the house is significant in part because it is a well-preserved example of Colonial architecture, and also because it was home of the locally prominent Barnes and Frost families. Philo Barnes, son of the locally prominent tavernkeeper Asa Barnes and a major local landowner in his own right, purchased the house in 1810, and it was occupied by three generations of Barneses. In 1881 it was purchased by Levi Frost, also from a prominent local family that owned a local factory. The house remained in the Frost family until 1916.

A helical band actuator, generally known by the trademark Spiralift, is a complex and specialized linear actuator used in stage lifts and material handling lifts. The actuator forms a high-capacity telescoping tubular column (lifting capacities to 25,000 pounds, travel to 40 feet).Spiralift Specifications: http://www.galainfo.com/pdfs/spiralift3_eng.pdf Raison d'√™tre Pierre Gagnon was awarded a US patent for the ‚ÄúPush Actuator‚Äù in 1989. Gagnon developed the actuator to substitute hydraulic cylinders in stage and orchestra lift systems. Hydraulic jacks were the predominant push actuators used in performing arts facilities, but they had their issues. The piston rods of a hydraulic lift extend below the platform they support by more than the length that the lift travels. For lifts at grade, housings for the rods are often sunk into support holes, known as caissons, that are inaccessible and often complicated by groundwater levels. If placed above ground, the space occupied by the rod housings is unusable. Gagnon‚Äôs actuator eliminates caissons and reduces the volume of unusable space below the platform of the lift. Another significant issue with hydraulic lifts is platform drift, the tendency of a platform to lower due to depressurization of the hydraulic system over time. Helical band actuators do not suffer from platform drift because they are rigid mechanical devices. Traveling nut screw jacks and rigid chain actuators can also be effective at addressing these issues with hydraulic jacks, and are also used for stage lifts. Principle of operation The telescoping column is formed by a pair of interlocking stainless steel bands. One band has a vertical rectangular profile and the other horizontal, much like an oversized Slinky. The vertical band spirals up on itself into a stacked helix, forming the wall of the column, while at the same time, the horizontal band interlocks the continuous spiral seam of the vertical band. When the column lowers, the bands separate and retract into two compact coils. The bands are combined, separated and stored by an assembly located at the base of the column. The result is an efficient (50%-80%) telescoping lifting column. To incorporate the device into a lift system, multiple helical band actuators are arranged below the lift platform where they are powered by an electric motor(s) and synchronized transmission. Helical band actuators require a separate lateral support mechanism, usually provided in the form of guide rails or self-guiding frame, such as a pantograph (e.g. a scissor lift).

Beyond, at the left of the cathedral, ruins of the Torre Civica. soldi. Regisole reproduction (C. Ferreri, 1832). The Regisole (\\"Sun King\\") was a bronze classical or Late Antique equestrian monument, highly influential during the Italian Renaissance but destroyed in 1796. It was originally erected at Ravenna, in what is now Italy, but was moved to Pavia in the Middle Ages, where it stood on a column before the cathedral, as an emblem of communal pride and Pavia's deep connection with imperial Rome.Romano Soriga, \\"La tradizione romana di Pavia e la statua del Regisole\\", Atti e memorie del primo congresso storico lombardo (Como/Varese 1936; offprint, Milan 1937; G.Q. Giglioli, \\"Il regisole di Pavia\\", Bullettino del Museo dell'Impero Romano 2' (1940:57‚Äì66); G. Bovini, \\"Le Vicende del 'Regisole' statua equestre Ravennate,\\" 'Felix Ravenna, 3rd ser. 35 (June 1963:138-54). History According to different modern scholars the subject was either Theodoric the Great, King of the Ostrogoths (reigned 471‚Äì526),Walter A. Liedtke, The Royal Horse and Rider: painting, sculpture, and horsemanship, 1989:65 \\"a Roman work of the third century AD\\", or \\"possibly Septimius Severus, with several later modifications\\" (he was emperor 193‚Äì211).Donald A. Bullough, Carolingian Renewal: sources and heritage, (1991:42). Ravenna was the capital city of the Western Roman Empire from 402 until 476. It was later the capital of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths and the Exarchate of Ravenna, the remaining Byzantine territory in northern Italy. The Colossus of Barletta is a standing Late Antique emperor in bronze that was probably erected on Constantinople's Column of Leo or in Ravenna. When, having been removed as a trophy of war to Milan, the Regisole was restored to Pavia in 1335, it was regilded and provided with up-to-date imperial trappings,Noted in Roberto Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (Oxford: Blackwell) 1973:29. which may have included anachronistic harness and stirrups. Petrarch, who was aware that it had originally come from Ravenna, praised it in a letter to Boccaccio.Petrarch, Rerum Senilium, v, 1, noted by Weiss 1973:35 and note. An impression of the Regisole, no doubt coloured by Renaissance ideals of decorum, is obtained from a woodcut illustration on the title page of the book of statutes of the city of Pavia, Statuta de Regimine Potestatis, civilia et criminalia Civitatis et Comitatus Papiae (Pavia, 1505).Illustrated, from the Houghton Library, Harvard, in Liedtke 1989, fig. 5. The Pavian bronze equestrian inspired 15th-century monuments such as the statues of the condottieri Gattamelata (which re-used the trick of adding a support under the raised leg of the horse, in this case a sphere instead of a dog) and Bartolomeo Colleoni.Bullough 1991:42. Leonardo da Vinci's note recording his visit to Pavia in June 1490 is recorded on a sheet of the Codex Atlanticus; the Regisole prompted him to write \\"the imitation of antique works is more praiseworthy than modern ones\\". His celebrated but minute record of the Regisole is among his drawings in the Royal Collection.Carlo Pedretti, Leonardo da Vinci: drawings of horses and other animals (Windsor Castle. Royal Library) 1984. The historian Edward Gibbon, in passing through Pavia in May 1764, recorded details of the Regisole before its destruction: an equestrian statue of an emperor clad in chlamys and unarmed, leaning slightly forward and extending his arm in the attitude of an orator. The man was not bad, he thought, but the horse ‚Äî which had inspired Leonardo ‚Äî was \\"proud and beautiful\\". Without an inscription the monument was then being identified with Antoninus Pius, Constantine (whom the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius at Rome was long thought to represent) and Charles V, but Gibbon remarked that, unarmed and without a diadem, the latter two identifications were unlikely.Gibbon's notebook jottings, in French, are quoted in Bullough 1991:74 note 15. The surviving images show the front left leg of the horse raised up, with the hoof resting on, or held by, a dog standing on its hind legs. After the French Revolution, the Regisole was destroyed by the Jacobin Club in Pavia in 1796, since it was considered a symbol of monarchy.R.

Chevallier, \\"A propos du 'Regisole'\\", Felix Ravenna, third series, no. 46 (1968:21‚Äì25).. In 1937 sculptor Francesco Messina was entrusted with the execution of a copy, according to ancient reproductions. The new Regisole, a 6-metre high bronze statue placed on a base of travertine, was relocated to the front of the Cathedral of Pavia and solemnly inaugurated on December 8, 1937.

Like many other x86 microprocessors, it translates x86 instructions (CISC instructions) into simpler internal operations (sometimes referred to as micro-ops, effectively RISC style instructions) prior to execution. The majority of instructions produce one micro-op when translated, with around 4% of instructions used in typical programs producing multiple micro-ops. The number of instructions that produce more than one micro-op is significantly fewer than the P6 and NetBurst microarchitectures. In the Bonnell microarchitecture, internal micro-ops can contain both a memory load and a memory store in connection with an ALU operation, thus being more similar to the x86 level and more powerful than the micro-ops used in previous designs. This enables relatively good performance with only two integer ALUs, and without any instruction reordering, speculative execution or register renaming. A side effect of having no speculative execution is invulnerability against Meltdown and Spectre. The Bonnell microarchitecture therefore represents a partial revival of the principles used in earlier Intel designs such as P5 and the i486, with the sole purpose of enhancing the performance per watt ratio. However, Hyper- Threading is implemented in an easy (i.e. low-power) way to employ the whole pipeline efficiently by avoiding the typical single thread dependencies. First generation cores =Silverthorne microprocessor= On 2 March 2008, Intel announced a new single-core Atom Z5xx series processor (code-named Silverthorne), to be used in ultra-mobile PCs and mobile Internet devices (MIDs), which will supersede Stealey (A100 and A110). The processor has 47 million transistors on a 25 mm2 die, allowing for extremely economical production at that time (~2500 chips on a single 300 mm diameter wafer). An Atom Z500 processor's dual-thread performance is equivalent to its predecessor Stealey, but should outperform it on applications that can use simultaneous multithreading and SSE3. They run from 0.8 to 2.0 GHz and have a TDP rating between 0.65 and 2.4 W that can dip down to 0.01 W when idle. They feature 32 KB instruction L1 and 24 KB data L1 caches, 512 KB L2 cache and a 533 MT/s front-side bus. The processors are manufactured in 45 nm process. Poulsbo was used as System Controller Hub and the platform was called Menlow. =Diamondville microprocessor= The Intel Atom N270 On 2 March 2008, Intel announced lower-power variants of the Diamondville CPU named Atom N2xx. It was intended for use in nettops and the Classmate PC. Like their predecessors, these are single-core CPUs with Hyper-Threading. The N270 has a TDP rating of 2.5 W, runs at 1.6 GHz and has a 533 MHz FSB. The N280 has a clock speed of 1.66 GHz and a 667 MHz FSB. On 22 September 2008, Intel announced a new 64-bit dual-core processor (unofficially code-named Dual Diamondville) branded Atom 330, to be used in desktop computers. It runs at 1.6 GHz and has an FSB speed of 533 MHz and a TDP rating of 8 W. Its dual core consists of two Diamondville dies on a single substrate. During 2009, Nvidia used the Atom 300 and their GeForce 9400M chipset on a mini-ITX form factor motherboard for their Ion platform. =First generation power requirements= The relatively low power Atom CPU was originally used with a cheaper, not so electricity-efficient chipset such as the Intel 945G. Although the Atom processor itself is relatively low-power for an x86 microprocessor, many chipsets commonly used with it dissipate significantly more power. For example, while the Atom N270 commonly used in netbooks through mid-2010 has a TDP rating of 2.5 W, an Intel Atom platform that uses the 945GSE Express chipset has a specified maximum TDP of 11.8 W, with the processor responsible for a relatively small portion of the total power dissipated. Individual figures are 2.5 W for the N270 processor, 6 W for the 945GSE chipset and 3.3 W for the 82801GBM I/O controller. Intel also provides a US15W System Controller Hub-based chipset with a combined TDP of less than 5 W together with the Atom Z5xx (Silverthorne) series processors, to be used in ultra-mobile PCs and MIDs, though some manufacturers have released ultra-thin systems running these processors (e.g. Sony VAIO X). Initially, all Atom motherboards on the consumer market featured the Intel 945GC chipset, which uses 22 watts by itself. As of early 2009, only a few manufacturers are offering lower-power motherboards with a 945GSE or US15W chipset and an Atom N270, N280 or Z5xx series CPU. Second generation cores =Pineview microprocessor= New Intel Atom N450 SLBMG 1.66GHz 512KB L2 BGA559 On 21 December 2009, Intel announced the N450, D510 and D410 CPUs with integrated graphics. The new manufacturing process resulted in a 20% reduction in power consumption and a 60% smaller die size. The Intel GMA 3150, a 45 nm shrink of the GMA 3100 with no HD capabilities, is included as the on-die GPU. Netbooks using this new processor were released on 11 January 2010. The major new feature is longer battery life (10 or more hours for 6-cell systems). This generation of the Atom was codenamed Pineview, which is used in the Pine Trail platform. Intel's Pine Trail-M platform utilizes an Atom processor (codenamed Pineview-M) and Platform Controller Hub (codenamed Tiger Point). The graphics and memory controller have moved into the processor, which is paired with the Tiger Point PCH. This creates a more power-efficient 2-chip platform rather than the 3-chip one used with previous-generation Atom chipsets. On 1 March 2010, Intel introduced the N470 processor, running at 1.83 GHz with a 667 MHz FSB and a TDP rating of 6.5 W. The new Atom N4xx chips became available on 11 January 2010. It is used in netbook and nettop systems and includes an integrated single-channel DDR2 memory controller and an integrated graphics core. It also features Hyper-Threading and is manufactured on a 45 nm process. The new design uses half the power of the older Menlow platform. This reduced overall power consumption and size makes the platform more desirable for use in smartphones and other mobile internet devices. The D4xx and D5xx series support the x86-64 bit instruction set and DDR2-800 memory. They are rated for embedded use. The series has an integrated graphics processor built directly into the CPU to help improve performance. The models are targeted at nettops and low-end desktops. They do not support SpeedStep. The Atom D510 dual-core processor runs at 1.66 GHz, with 1 MB of L2 cache and a TDP rating of 13 W. The single-core Atom D410 runs at 1.66 GHz, with 512 KB of L2 cache and a TDP rating of 10 W. =Tunnel Creek microprocessor= Tunnel Creek is an embedded Atom processor used in the Queens Bay platform with the Topcliff PCH. =Lincroft microprocessor= The Lincroft (Z6xx) with the Whitney Point PCH is included in the Oak Trail tablet platform. Oak Trail is an Intel Atom platform based on Moorestown. Both platforms include a Lincroft microprocessor, but use two distinct input/output Platform Controller Hubs (I/O-PCH), codenamed Langwell and Whitney Point respectively. Oak Trail was presented on 11 April 2011 and was to be released in May 2011. The Z670 processor, part of the Oak Trail platform, delivers improved video playback, faster Internet browsing and longer battery life, \\"without sacrificing performance\\" according to Intel. Oak Trail includes support for 1080p video decoding as well as HDMI. The platform also has improved power efficiency and allows applications to run on various operating systems, including Android, MeeGo and Windows. =Stellarton microprocessor= Stellarton is a Tunnel Creek CPU with an Altera Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). =Sodaville SoC= Sodaville is a consumer electronics Atom SoC. =Groveland SoC= Groveland is a consumer electronics Atom SoC. Third generation cores The 32 nm shrink of Bonnell is called Saltwell. =Cedarview microprocessor= Intel released their third-generation Cedar Trail platform (consisting of a range of Cedarview processors and the NM10 southbridge chip) based on 32 nm process technology in the fourth quarter of 2011. Intel stated that improvements in graphics capabilities, including support for 1080p video, additional display options including HDMI and DisplayPort, and enhancements in power consumption are to enable fanless designs with longer battery life. The Cedar Trail platform includes two new CPUs, 32 nm-based N2800 (1.86 GHz) and N2600 (1.6 GHz), which replace the previous generation Pineview N4xx and N5xx processors. The CPUs also feature an integrated GPU that supports DirectX 9\\\\. In addition to the netbook platform, two new Cedarview CPUs for nettops, D2500 and D2700, were released on 25 September 2011. In early March 2012, the N2800-based Intel DN2800MT motherboard started to become available.

Within these levels, there are four basic levels of spiritual development that human beings on Earth progress through as they reincarnate, although evil acts may cause bad karma which may cause one to temporarily regress. It is believed that when souls have advanced to the fourth level of initiation, they have reached enlightenment and have no further need to reincarnate. At the fifth level of initiation and beyond, souls have the opportunity to become members of the Spiritual Hierarchy. This concept was developed by both C. W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey beginning in the 1920s. According to C.W. Leadbeater, Initiation is a process by which \\"we try to develop ourselves not that we may become great and wise, but that we may have the power and knowledge to work for humanity to the best effect.\\"Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 ‚Äì Theosophical Publishing House Page 166 According to Alice A. Bailey, Initiation is the \\"process of undergoing an expansion [toward higher levels] of consciousness\\"Bailey, Alice A. Initiation, Human and Solar New York: 1922 ‚Äì Lucis Publishing, page 12 It is believed by Theosophists that all souls that have reached the fourth level of initiation and evolved beyond the necessity to reincarnate that do not elect to become pratyeka buddhas and go directly into Nirvana gradually evolve upward through all of these six higher levels of consciousness over thousands or millions of years, and later over billions or trillions of years, other higher levels yet beyond. The concept of Initiation is also recognized in the Ascended Master Teachings, a group of religions loosely based on Theosophy. In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is referred to as Ascension. The first six initiations were named by C.W. Leadbeater and Alice A. Bailey after the six most important events in the life of Jesus. According to Martin Euser, ‚ÄúTheosophy closes the gap between science and religion by positing reincarnation as a dynamic process [ unlike the concept of the eternal return ]. The first jewel concerns the doctrine of reincarnation or reembodiment. It's all a dynamic process and it's the way nature works.‚ÄùEuser, Martin Science and Spirituality in the New Millennium 2008 Initiation zero The vast majority of ordinary humanity lies on the probationary path (below the first initiation). First initiation (\\"birth\\" to the spiritual life) According to Alice A. Bailey, at the first initiation one gains full control of the physical body.Bailey, Alice A. Initiation, Human and Solar New York: 1922 ‚Äì Lucis Publishing, page 82 Bailey's student Benjamin Creme advanced a belief that there are 800,000 people at this level of initiation.Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission Amsterdam:1986 Share International Foundation Page 195 In the Ascended Master Teachings, a soul that reaches this level is referred to as having attained their Individualized \\"I AM\\" Presence, the prerequisite for further spiritual advancement. Second initiation (\\"baptism\\") Alice A. Bailey states that at the second initiation, one gains full control of the astral body.Bailey, Alice A. Initiation, Human and Solar New York: 1922 ‚Äì Lucis Publishing, page 85 According to Benjamin Creme, there are 240,000 people at this level of initiation. Third initiation (\\"the transfiguration\\") An individual who is at the level of the third initiation has acquired fully developed clairvoyance and clairaudience.Bailey, Alice A. Initiation, Human and Solar New York: 1922 ‚Äì Lucis Publishing, page 87 According to Benjamin Creme, there are somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 people at this level of initiation. Fourth initiation (\\"the crucifixion\\") An individual reaching the fourth initiation is known as the perfected one, or an Arhat (Pali) or a Paramahamsa (Sanskrit). At this level, it is believed in Buddhism, one has the ability to remember all of one's past lives, and one also has various minor siddhis capable of affecting one's immediate environment. Symbolically the fourth initiation is denoted as the crucifixion initiation. An Arhat is supposed to be one who does not need to be incarnated again to develop spiritually. According to Benjamin Creme, there are 450 people at this level of initiation. =\\"The seven choices before the perfect [hu]man\\"= Having reached the threshold of the fifth initiation, a soul does not necessarily have to enter Earth's spiritual hierarchy proper as one of the \\"Masters of the Ancient Wisdom\\". One has seven paths forward to higher levels that they can choose to go forward on, only one of which is to become a \\"Master of the Ancient Wisdom\\". These seven choices, called in Theosophical literature \\"the seven choices before the perfect [hu]man\\" are: :1. \\"Remain with humanity as on official of the Hierarchy\\", i.e., become one of the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom. :2. \\"Remain with humanity as a \\"Nirmanakaya\\", i.e., become a bodhisattva. :3. \\"Join the Devas\\". :4. \\"Join the Staff Corps of the Solar Logos\\", i.e., join the Masters living in etheric cities inside the Sun who supervise the activities of the Solar Angels that direct the process of evolution of the life waves (process of reincarnation) of the beings on all the planets of the solar system (all of whom live except those on Earth live on the etheric planes of their planets). :5. \\"Prepare the work of the next Chain\\", i.e. join that subsection of the Staff Corps of the Solar Logos who are the solar planners who plan the future development of planetary civilizations in this solar system. :6.&7\\\\. \\"Enter Nirvana\\", i.e., become a Pratyekabuddha.Gardner, E.L. The Web of the Universe London:1936 Theosophical Publishing House \\"The Seven Choices Before the Perfect Man\\" Page 97\\"Web of the Universe\\" text on Internet: Fifth initiation (\\"the resurrection\\") The fifth initiation, called the resurrection, comprises the first rung of beings designated in Theosophy as Masters of the Ancient Wisdom and in the Ascended Master Teachings as Ascended masters. Siddhis at this level include the ability to teleport and bilocate moderate distances and levitate within a localized area. According to C. W. Leadbeater, Alice Bailey and Benjamin Creme, there are a total of 43 beings at this level of initiation; this figure is arrived at because all three have stated there are a total of 60 Masters in all‚Äîsubtracting from the 60 the 17 Masters at level six and above identified by C. W. Leadbeater, leaves a total of 43 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at the fifth level of initiation. Of these 43 Masters, a total of 12 have been identified by name, one by C. W. Leadbeater, nine by Alice Bailey, and two by Benjamin Creme. C. W. Leadbeater named a Master called Master Jupiter who lives in India that is involved with overseeing the people, government, and development of India that is at this level.Leadbeater, C. W. The Masters and the Path Adyar, Madras, India: 1925 ‚Äì Theosophical Publishing House, page 33 Alice A. Bailey identified as Masters the Master P., who is said to help St. Germain bring about the Age of Aquarius in the Americas, and two different English Masters (English Master #1 and English Master #2), one of which is said to have inspired the labor movement.Bailey, Alice A. The Externalisation of the Hierarchy New York:1957--Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) Master P. Page 682; See numerous references to \\"English Master\\" in Index In addition to these three, she identified the three Lords of Liberation ‚Äì (Lord of Liberation #1, Lord of Liberation #2, and Lord of Liberation #3). According to Alice A. Bailey, the three Lords of Liberation formulated the slogan Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. Finally, Alice A. Bailey also identified the three Lords of Karma (Lord of Karma #1, Lord of Karma #2, and Lord of Karma #3). These three beings are said to live in Shamballah and help Sanat Kumara decide where and when souls are going to incarnate in their next life.Bailey, Alice A. The Externalisation of the Hierarchy New York:1957 --Lucis Press (Compilation of earlier revelations by Alice A. Bailey) \\"Lords of Liberation\\" Benjamin Creme identified two previously unidentified Masters at this level in 2001‚Äîhe stated that there is a Master in MoscowCreme, Benjamin The Great Approach: New Light and Life for Humanity Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 179 and a Master in Tokyo,Creme, Benjamin The Great Approach: New Light and Life for Humanity Amsterdam:2001 Share International Foundation Page 177 but did not give their personal names. Forty-three minus 12 equals 31 Masters of the Ancient Wisdom at this level that are still unidentified by name. Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet claimed to have identified, named, and received dictations from at least 200 new \\"Ascended Masters\\" at this level;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press \\"Profiles of the Ascended Masters\\" ‚Äì pages 13‚Äì394 More than 200 \\"Ascended Masters\\" are listed however, these Masters are not recognized as Masters of the Ancient Wisdom by traditional Theosophists. Ascended Masters named by Guy Ballard and Elizabeth Clare Prophet at this level include such Masters as Confucius, Lord Ling, Lady Master Magda, Pallas Athena, Lanello, Kwan Yin, the Great Divine Director, Padre Pio, Godfre and his \\"twin flame\\" (celestial wife) Lady Master Lotus, and many dozens more. In Elizabeth Clare Prophet's Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Jupiter is referred to as Chananda.Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Chananda Pages 54‚Äì55 Also, Sanat Kumara has a grandson named Master Cha Ara who is half mortal and who just recently became a Master, functioning at the fifth level. There is a new master going by the name of Pax Tecum that has reached 5th level of initiation in 2020, he is stationed at the fifth level, but sources claim and can be verified with the hierarchy that he has some special abilities as his origin is unknown, but is assumed that he came here as additional assistance to the hierarchy on his own behalf. Sixth initiation (\\"the ascension\\" or \\"masterhood\\") The Chohans (Lords) of the Seven Rays ‚Äì Morya (1st Ray), Master Koot Hoomi (2nd Ray), Paul the Venetian (3rd Ray), Serapis Bey (4th Ray), Master Hilarion (5th Ray), Master Jesus (6th Ray), and the Master Rakoczi (7th Ray) ‚Äì are seven of the beings at the level of the sixth initiation, while their coordinator and communications director Djwal Khul is another, making a total of eight at this level.Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 \\"Diagram 5 ‚Äì The Spiritual Hierarchy\\" ‚Äì facing page 248 All of these Masters are recognized by both traditional Theosophists and those who believe in Elizabeth Prophet's Ascended Master Teachings. Master Rakoczi is referred to as St. Germain by several such groups including Prophet's and the \\"I AM Religious Activity\\". Siddhis at this level include the ability to teleport, bilocate, or levitate to anyplace on Earth. According to the Ascended Master Teachings, on January 1, 1956, the Master Jesus advanced from the sixth to the seventh level of initiation and the Lady Master Nada (a lady Master recognized in Prophet's works but not in Theosophy) advanced from the fifth level to the sixth level and replaced the Master Jesus as the chohan of the sixth ray.Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 240 Seventh initiation (\\"bodhisattva\\" , \\"avatar\\", or \\"christhood\\") The seventh initiation is known as the initiation of the Bodhisattava (Buddhism) or the Avatar (Hinduism). The Maitreya or World Teacher (known as Krishna by Hindus, the Christ by Christians, Maitreya by Buddhists, Messiah by the Jews, the Iman Mahdi by Muslims, and the Peshotan by the Zoroastrians) is at this level. At this level also are said to be the Chakshusha Manu, the Vaivasvatu Manu and the Maha Chohan,Bailey, Alice A. Initiation, Human and Solar New York: 1922, Lucis Publishing Chart, page 49 thus making a total of four beings at this level. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Chakshusha Manu is referred to as Lord Himalaya. According to Benjamin Creme, a being at this level has the ability to teleport to anyplace in the solar system.Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission ‚Äì Volume III Amsterdam: 1997 Share International Foundation, page 72 Creme admits, however, that unless one is in a hurry, it's simpler, easier, and uses less energy to just take a flying saucer. Creme has also stated that beings at this level have a level of invulnerability such that they would not be affected by a bullet fired at them, nor even by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Maitreya advanced from the 7th level to the 8th level. Eighth initiation (\\"buddhahood\\") Level eight is the level of the Buddha. At this level also, according to C.W. Leadbeater, are The Three Pratyeka Buddhas (the task of these three Buddhas is to focus the Seven Rays from Sanat Kumara through Djwal Khul to the chohans of the Seven Rays). Unlike Buddha, the three Pratyeka Buddhas do not interact with the human race except for fulfilling their function of focusing the seven rays. Alice A. Bailey stated that communication among beings at this level is entirely by telepathy. According to Theosophist Alfred Percy Sinnett, beings at this level can freely roam both in interplanetary space and in nearby interstellar space in full consciousness while physically remaining in their celestialized bodies and carrying on normal activities such as communicating with other beings.Sinnett, A. P. Esoteric Buddhism, London 1883 In order for beings at this level to be able to do this, it would have been necessary for them to have activated their transpersonal chakras. Benjamin Creme and Elizabeth Clare Prophet have stated that beings at this level can teleport as far as the star Sirius. This makes four beings at this level, according to traditional Theosophy. In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that on January 1, 1956, Buddha advanced from the 8th level to the 9th level, becoming co-equal with Sanat Kumara. The three Pratyeka Buddhas have not been mentioned so far in any of the Ascended Master Teachings. Elizabeth Clare Prophet described and quoted from Buddhist sources on the Five Dhyani Buddhas of mainstream Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. They focus the five inner rays which together with the seven more external rays focused by the Chohans comprise the twelve rays.Elizabeth Clare Prophet Vol. 37 No. 2 The Buddhas in Winter 2 Introduction to the Five Dhyani Buddhas and Their Mandala, p2, January 9, 1994 Ninth initiation (\\"godhood\\") Level nine is the \\"Lord of the World\\": Sanat Kumara ‚Äì \\"The Eternal Youth\\" and \\"The Ancient of Days\\", the Nordic alien that is believed by Theosophists to be the \\"Lord of the World\\", i.e., the governing deity of Earth. C.W. Leadbeater discussed the abilities of beings at this level. He stated that Sanat Kumara's \\"consciousness is of so extended a nature that it comprehends at once all the life on our globe. In his hands are the powers of cyclic destruction, for he wields Fohat [i.e. beams composed of \\"bubbles in space\\" used by Theosophical deities to materialize or dematerialize material objectsPowell, A.E. The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 19] in its higher forms and can deal directly with cosmic forces outside our chain [i.e., outside our solar system].\\"Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Page 296 Thus according to Leadbeater powers of beings at this level include omniscience regarding the events occurring on a single inhabited planet, materialization of large objects, and the ability to affect at a distance to some degree happenings in other nearby planetary systems. According to the Ascended Master Teachings, Sanat Kumara has a \\"twin flame\\" (celestial wife) named Lady Master Venus who he brought with him from Venus, as well as a daughter named Lady Master Meta born to them on Venus who they brought with them to Earth, both of them presumably also functioning at the ninth level of initiation. Tenth initiation (\\"planetary logos\\") The tenth initiation is considered to symbolize perfection and is used to describe the Planetary Logos, also called the Spirit of the Earth, and specifically denoted as the Planetary Logos of Earth.Powell, A.E. The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House Chapter XXVI ‚Äì \\"The Building of the Earth\\" The Planetary Logos, pages 162‚Äì163 In order to reach the status of a Planetary Logos, this being would have had to have been a high level Planetary Deva in some other solar system before it incarnated inside our planet at the time of the creation of the world. According to C. W. Leadbeater, the \\"Planetary Logos\\" is functioning at the tenth level of initiation and Sanat Kumara, in continuous telepathic rapport with the Planetary Logos, functions as its spokes-deity. Since the formulation in the early 1970s by James Lovelock of the Gaia hypothesis, many Theosophists and those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings, adopting the Gaia philosophy, nowadays simply refer to the \\"Planetary Logos of Earth\\" as Gaia, the New Age version of what in many religions is called the Earth mother.. Levels of initiation beyond the tenth level In the theosophical teachings of Alice Bailey, there is a powerful being living inside the sun serving the Solar Logos called the Avatar of Synthesis.Bailey, Alice A. The Externalisation of the Hierarchy New York:1957 Lucis Publishing Co. See \\"Avatar of Synthesis\\" in the Index Its job is to transmit the seven rays from the heart of the sun through the seven spirits before the [solar] throne to all the life waves of the solar system. According to Benjamin Creme, the Avatar of Synthesis is functioning at the 17th level of initiation.Creme, Benjamin Maitreya's Mission ‚Äì Volume III Amsterdam:1997 Share Foundation Page 72 In the Ascended Master Teachings, this being is called Ray-O-Light.Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Ray-O-Light Page 301 The only master above all these levels is the Christ. The Solar Logos itself must be at least several levels beyond the 17th level. The Solar Logos, the Sun God in Theosophy, is personified as the cosmic beings Helios and his twin flame (celestial wife) Vesta, the \\"God and Goddess of this solar system\\", in the Ascended Master Teachings.Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) The Masters and Their Retreats Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Helios and Vesta Page 126 Perhaps several dozen or a couple of hundred of levels above the Solar Logos would be the Galactic Logos. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Galactic Logos is personified as the cosmic being Averran. C.W. Leadbeater stated, \\"The ladder of being [i.e., of initiation] extends upward into clouds of light, into which few of us can yet penetrate, and when we ask those who stand higher than we and know infinitely more than we do, all they can say is that it extends beyond their sight also. They know very many more steps of it than we do, but it goes still further, onwards and upward to unimaginable heights of glory, and no one knows its end.\\"Leadbeater, C.W. The Masters and the Path. Adyar, India: Theosophical Publishing House 1925 Page 207 The number of levels of initiation ultimately would depend on the physical size of the Cosmos, because enough souls would have to climb the ladder to ensoul all the stars with stellar logoi and all the galaxies with galactic logoi, plus provide staffing for their attendant cosmic bureaucracies of angels, archangels, etc., as souls beyond them on the scale of initiation move up the ladder. If Alan Guth's inflation theory, which states that the actual size of the Cosmos is at least fifteen orders of magnitude larger than the observable universe (itself 93,000,000,000 light years in diameter), is correct, then there could be several hundred or even thousands of levels of initiation necessary to staff the large scale structures of the cosmos before reaching the level of the Cosmic Logos. In the Ascended Master Teachings, the Cosmic Logos is personified as the cosmic beings Alpha and Omega. If the concept of the Multiverse is true, then other hierarchies exist in other Universes. It is believed in Theosopy that the concept of the Multiverse is true because Theosophists have stated that the Universal Logos has created many other cosmoses besides our own. Initiation in popular culture Music * In 1975, Todd Rundgren released an album titled Initiation which has a song called \\"Initiation\\" on side one. The title of the album is apparently based on the Theosophical concept of Initiation as taught by Alice Bailey and C. W. Leadbeater. The entire second side of the album is taken up by a song called \\"A Treatise on Cosmic Fire\\"; the three parts of the song are listed as: \\"I. The Internal Fire, or Fire by Friction; II. The Fire of Spirit, or Electric Fire; The Fire of Mind, or Solar Fire.\\" The second parts of these three phrases are taken directly from Alice A. Bailey's book A Treatise on Cosmic Fire.

It was formed by the Metropolis Management Act 1855 and was governed by the Fulham District Board of Works, which consisted of elected vestrymen. It was in the part of the county of Middlesex that was within the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works. It occupied broadly the same area as ancient parish of Fulham and that of the current London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. Area The district comprised the civil parishes of Fulham and Hammersmith. Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; however the parishes of Fulham District Board of Works did not exceed this number so were not divided into wards. In 1873 the population had increased enough for the parish of Hammersmith to be divided into three wards (electing vestrymen): North (24), Centre (27) and South (21). In 1883-84 the population had increased enough for the parish of Fulham to also be divided into three wards (electing vestrymen): North End (27), Walham (27) and South Fulham (18). Abolition The district was abolished in 1886 following the Metropolis Management Amendment Act 1885 with the vestry of each parish taking on local administration. Each parish would go on to form a metropolitan borough in the County of London in 1900. These two were merged in 1965 to form the London Borough of Hammersmith.

In 1910 the Executive Committee recommended that the Bar Association should be registered. The General House on 9 June 1910, accepted the recommendations and registered it as Bar Association. History The earliest trace of the Lahore Bar as a body to be acknowledged and accepted starts from 1882. In October, 1882, the Judges of the Chief Court passed Resolution requesting Mr. C. H. Spitta, Barrister-at-Law (then a leading member of the legal fraternity and later to become a temporary judge of the Chief Court) to convince a Special Meeting of the Bar, to devise measures to root out touting. In compliance with this Resolution, Mr. C. H. Spitta convened a meeting of the Lahore Bar on 22 November 1882, in the Bar Room and at which five Barristers and thirteen Pleaders attended. The meeting was presided by Mr. C. H. Spitta. At the meeting, ten resolutions to root out touting were passed by the Lahore Bar and their copies transmitted to the Registrar of the Chief Court, for his attention. These were received and under the orders of the Judges, circulated by the Chief Court to all the Commissioners and Superintendents of the various Divisions for compliance. Apart from the above, there is no further evidence of the Lahore Bar till 1892-93. Out of the Association‚Äôs available records, the register containing the Minutes of the earliest General Meetings of the Chief Court Bar Association starts from the year 1893. The file dealing with the subject \\"Touts-High Court\\" amongst the High Court‚Äôs records, contains the copy of a letter addressed to the Secretary of the Bar Association in 1892 and his seems to be the earliest letter traceable from the various High Court files addressed to the legal fraternity practicing in the Chief court in its capacity as an Association. From these items of evidence, it can fairly be inferred that the Lahore Bar assumed some maturity by 1882 and became an entity which commanded attention and to which the Chief Court had to look to for assistance. But the Lahore Bar as a collective group or entity took birth somewhere after 1882 and before 1892-93. In 1910 the Executive Committee recommended that the Chief Court Bar Association should be registered and that the Secretary should take necessary steps for this purpose. The General House in its meeting held on 9 June 1910, accepted the recommendations of the Committee.

With the outbreak of the Sonderbund war in autumn 1847, Steinh√§uslin was recalled to Switzerland. He served as a lieutenant in a Bernese unit on the Federal side (the 19th battalion, 2nd brigade, II.

In the field, he made a number of ink drawings illustrating the actions of his unit as well as of the major engagements of the war, based on the testimony of fellow soldiers. After the war, he continued to pursue his military career, rising to the grade of lieutenant-colonel commanding a brigade in the army mobilization of 1870.

These included a low-cost \\"iron lung\\", a humidicrib, the first portable electrocardiograph and the \\"visitel\\" ‚Äì a forerunner to the modern fax machine. His inventions gained him an OBE in 1940, and his work led to Both being given the moniker of the \\"Edison of Australia\\". Early life Edward Both was born to James Alexander Both and Lucy Victoria (n√©e Thomas) in the town of Caltowie, (near Jamestown) in South Australia. His parents had five children, of which Edward Both was the eldest. He was schooled in the local area, attending Caltowie Public and Jamestown High schools, and proved to be a good student ‚Äì sufficiently so that when he was sixteen Both began studying at the Physics Department at the University of Adelaide. There he caught the attention of Kerr Grant, a physics professor, who subsequently appointed him as his personal assistant. In 1932 an electrocardiograph (ECG) developed by Both impressed Grant, and as a result Grant had a facility installed next to the University where Both could design and produce medical equipment. Both Equipment Limited A Both Cabinet Respirator being used to treat a patient at the 110th Australian Military Hospital in 1943 Both was soon considered to be the \\"foremost among designers of intricate tools of the medical trade in South Australia\\". Both's cardiograph was an improvement on previous examples because it showed the heart's action instantly. Working with his brother Donald, Both spent the next four years meeting orders for their electrocardiograph ‚Äì for many years their products were the only commercially available direct-wiring models, and the ECGs they produced provided very accurate readings. An outbreak of poliomyelitis (polio) in Australia during 1937 saw a need for iron lungs to help those stricken with the disease. However, there were only a few such devices in Australia, and the US-built iron lungs were both expensive to purchase and hard to maintain. Thus the company was approached to develop an alternative. The result was the Both Respirator: a lightweight, comparatively inexpensive respirator made out of plywood (the name \\"iron lung\\" continued to be used by many, in spite of the wooden construction). The design proved effective, and the respirators were soon employed throughout Australia. Indeed, even as recently as 2003 there were several Both respirators still being used in private residences. In 1938 Both was in England to sell his ECG machines when he heard a request over BBC Radio for an iron lung to assist an individual suffering from poliomyelitis. With the assistance of the South Australian Agent-General, Both set up shop in a hired workshop and produced a few of his \\"cabinets\\", one of which was featured in a film produced by the Nuffield Department of Anaesthetics at Radcliffe Infirmary. The film was viewed by William Morris (Lord Nuffield), who was inspired to construct the devices at his Morris Motors LImited factory and offer them, free of charge, to any hospital in the Commonwealth that requested one. In the years that preceded World War II, approximately 1800 Both-Nuffield respirators were supplied to hospitals around the world. A request for information from America about Both's respirator was sent because of the lower cost of the device to fight poliomyelitis. Both arranged for an American company, K.N.Y Scheerer Corporation to produce the respirator in America. On his return from England Both created an ultracentrifuge for isolating very fine viruses. It was the first of its kind in Australia and could be used on the polio virus. =World War II= During the war years Both continued to invent devices, often for the military. The electro-micrometer and electro-crack detector that he developed were designed to inspect the inside of gun-barrels for flaws, and he was involved in work to develop guided torpedoes. Other war time inventions included a three-wheeled electric van for use during petrol rationing that employed a new type of transmission and could turn on the spot, additional medical equipment, (including a portable cardiograph that became standard military equipment during World War II), and the \\"Visitel\\" ‚Äì a device that could transmit drawings over long distances. The visitel was deemed a secret project by the military, and because of the secrecy surrounding it the device was still unused by the end of the war. By 1950 it had been installed at Randwick Racecourse to expedite totalisator operation. As a diversion during the war Both designed a Punch and Judy machine that showed Hitler being hit with an umbrella by Chamberlain whenever a coin was put in the slot. The money raised by the machine went to charity. =Post-war= With the war over Both, now based in Sydney, continued to invent. With his brother he continued to work in medical equipment, developing a humidicrib, a new concept in design for blood transfusion equipment, and an electro-encephalograph. The electro- encephalograph designed and manufactured by Both Equipment Limited was used as an aid to the diagnosis of nervous disorders through its recording of the electrical activity of the brain. Both also worked in other fields: amongst his post-war projects were the electric scoreboards for the 1952 Davis Cup and the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. The Olympic scoreboard was made up of 10,000 light bulbs and could show all of the letters of the alphabet along with numerals. Along with the scoreboards two versions of a pen recorder were developed and produced by Both: one was used as Woomera for weapons research and the other was used for Antarctic Research, the CSIRO, universities, hospitals and medical and industrial research. In 1953 Donald Both submitted a design for the humidicrib to the Queen's Coronation Gift Committee and it was accepted as a gift on behalf of the people of South Australia. Personal life Both married Lily Eileen Maud Naughton in September 1937. Throughout his life Both enjoyed sports, especially swimming and tennis, although he had a reputation for possessing an \\"exhausting capacity for work\\". Both died at the age of 79 on 18 November 1987 while at Mount Beauty in Victoria.

Life Hulft was born as the youngest son of the brewer Pieter Hulft, and member of the Civic Guard at the Lastage, a neighborhood near the port of Amsterdam. After concluding his law studies Gerard Hulft was made Secretary to the City Council in 1645, a position he held until 1653. He served under Johan Huydecoper van Maarsseveen, Andries Bicker, and Cornelis de Graeff. In 1652, a merchant vessel in which he had invested a fortune, was captured by the British. In the ensuing war Hulft hired and kept at his own expense a group of 24 sailors along which he served under Admiral Witte de Witt (1654). After the war he lost his job as Secretary due to an administrative conflict with the burgomasters, when he refused to change the wording.

Upon his arrival in Batavia in October, after a six-month journey, he joined the Council of Indies. In August 1655 the shrewd Joan Maetsuycker sent him with eleven ships and 1120 soldiers to Ceylon.Balbian Verster, J.F.L. (1932) Gerard Hulft 1621 - 1656, p. 141. In: Yearbook Amstelodamum. His mission was to crush the Portuguese utterly. Hulft arrived in mid-September in Negombo. During his staying in Ceylon he maintained cordial relations with Rajasinghe II of Sri Lanka, the most powerful king of the island. Hulft marched from Maggona and fought the Portuguese in the vicinity of the Panadura Moya Kata. The Dutch took the fort of Kalutara by surprise and laid siege to the city of Colombo, in October 1655. On their first attack on 12 November, the Dutch lost 300 people, and 350 were seriously wounded. Half a year later Hulft died in action, being hit from the townwall by an arquebus in his right shoulder. This happened a month before the surrender of Colombo and two weeks after his visit to the Royal Palace, as described by the Dutch minister and orientalist Philippus Baldaeus. His corpse was decorated with flowers and fruits and transported to Galle. His ensign Pieter de Bitter brought the news to Batavia.

Through HP Russia, a partnership between Point Venture Partners and HarborVest Capital invested $50 million of European Bank of Reconstruction and Development money into the emerging Russian economy, Minno gained notice in the international private equity community. During those years, Minno sat on multiple Boards and achieved successful exits in his investments, notably E-Transport (sold to Descartes for a 17X multiple) and Avidia (sold to PairGain for > 200% IRR). In Russia, he led the initial investment of the Fund into a wallpaper manufacturing facility in Saratov. In the later 1990s Minno worked in operating roles in start up companies. He is known for his work as CFO, VP Business Development and Investor/Board Member for Safeguard Interactive which was sold to StorageTek. He also served as CEO and Investor/Board Member in another start up company, Jovio, sold to Management Science Associates. Minno's involvement with these companies has drawn international attention. In 2001, Minno became Managing Director of Wilshire Associates where he led the global venture capital investment process which totaled about $1 billion in 90 Funds (about 40 Firms) in the US, Europe and Asia. He also started the secondary investing for the firm, opened the Silicon Valley platform and served on the Investment Committee during his full tenure. He served on a number of venture capital partnership advisory boards including Weston Presidio, Sofinnova Venture Partners, Domain Partners, Global Catalyst Partners, O‚ÄôReilly AlphaTech Ventures and Saints Capital. Minno has a CFA designation and graduated from Carnegie Mellon (MBA) and Vanderbilt University (BECE). Minno's work in all stages of investment over his career has been recognized as important and unique in the investment world.

Their remains, teeth and phalanges, are only known from Callao Cave in the northern part of the island dating to before 50,000 years ago. They were initially identified as belonging to modern humans in 2010, but in 2019, after the discovery of more specimens, they were placed into a new species based on the presence of a wide range of traits similar to modern humans as well as Australopithecus and early Homo. Their ancestors, who may have been Asian H. erectus or some other even earlier Homo, would have needed to have made a great sea crossing to reach the island, and hominin presence on Luzon dates to at latest 771,000 to 631,000 years ago. The inhabitants of the cave dragged in mainly Philippine deer carcasses, and used tools for butchering. Taxonomy Interior of Callao Cave, Luzon, the Philippines The first remains were discovered in 2007 in Callao Cave in Northern Luzon, the Philippines. In 2010, French anthropologist Florent D√©troit and Filipino archaeologist Armand Mijares and colleagues identified them as belonging to modern humans. In 2019, after the discovery of 12 new specimens and based on the apparent presence of both modern-humanlike and primitive Australopithecus-like features, they reassigned the remains (and other hominin findings from the cave) to a new species, Homo luzonensis, the species name deriving from the name of the island. The holotype, CCH6, comprises the upper right premolars and molars. The paratypes are: CCH1, a right third metatarsal bone of the foot; CCH2 and CCH5, two phalanges of the fingers; CCH3 and CCH4, two phalanges of the foot; CCH4, a left premolar; and CCH9, a right third molar. CCH7 represents a juvenile femoral shaft. These represent at least 3 individuals. The specimens are kept at the National Museum of the Philippines, Manila. The exact taxonomic placement of H. luzonensis is unknown, and, like for other tropical hominins, DNA extraction failed. It is possible that‚Äîlike what is hypothesized for H. floresiensis from Flores, Indonesia‚ÄîH. luzonensis descended from an early H. erectus dispersal across Southeast Asia. It is also possible that these two insular archaic humans descend from an entirely different Homo species possibly earlier than H. erectus. The bones were dated to before 50,000 years ago, and there is evidence of hominin activity on the island as early as 771,000 ‚Äì 631,000 years ago. Anatomy Comparison of teeth (above) and foot phalanges (below) of A. afarensis (left), H. luzonensis (center), and modern humans (right) Like other endemic fauna on Luzon, as well as H. floresiensis, H. luzonensis may have shrunk in size due to insular dwarfism. However, more complete remains are needed to verify size. Much like H. floresiensis, H. luzonensis presents a number of characteristics more similar to Australopithecus and early Homo than to modern humans and more recent Homo. The teeth of H. luzonensis are small and mesiodistally (the length between the two ends of the tooth) shortened. The molars are smaller than those of H. floresiensis. Like other recent Homo and modern humans, the molars decrease in size towards the back of the mouth, and the enamel-dentin juncture lacks well defined wavy crenulations. The enamel-dentine juncture is most similar to that of Asian H. erectus. The premolars are oddly large compared to the molars, with more similar proportions to Paranthropus than any other Homo, though H. luzonensis postcanine teeth differ greatly from those of Paranthropus in size and shape. H. luzonensis premolars share many characteristics with those of Australopithecus, Paranthropus, and early Homo. The finger bones are long, narrow, and curved, which is seen in Australopithecus, H. floresiensis, and sometimes modern humans. They are dorso-palmarly (from the palm to the back of the hand) compressed, and have well developed flexor sheath attachment, which are seen in Australopithecus and the early H. habilis. Unique to H. luzonensis, the dorsal beak near the knuckle was strongly developed and angled towards the wrist rather than the finger. The foot bones are morphologically unique among Homo, and are more or less indistinguishable from those of A. africanus and A. afarensis. Australopithecus limbs are generally interpreted as being adaptations for bipedalism and potentially suspensory behavior in the trees, but the fragmentary record of H. luzonensis limits extrapolation of locomotory behavior. Since the remains are so fragmentary, it is difficult to make accurate estimates of actual size for this species, but they may have been within the range of modern day Philippine Negritos, who average in height for males and for females. Culture The ancestors of H. luzonensis crossed the Huxley Line into the Philippines. Because Luzon has always been an island in the Quaternary, the ancestors of H. luzonensis would have had to have made a substantial sea crossing and crossed the Huxley Line. About 90% of the bone fragments from Callao Cave belong to the Philippine deer, which suggests that deer carcasses were periodically brought into the cave. With the exception of Palawan (where there were tigers), there is no evidence of large carnivores ever inhabiting the Philippines during the Pleistocene, which attributes these remains to human activity. The Philippine warty pig and an extinct bovid were also present. There are cut marks on a deer tibia, and a lack of tools in the cave could either have resulted from the use of organic material for tools rather than stone, or the processing of meat away from the cave. A much earlier site in the Cagayan Valley of northern Luzon has yielded an almost complete rhino skeleton (the extinct Rhinoceros philippinensis) which had been butchered dating to 771‚Äì631,000 years ago. The site also bears 6 lithic cores, 49 lithic flakes, and 2 hammerstones, which are similar to the chert industry from the Lower Paleolithic Arubo 1 site in central Luzon. Also present were the remains of the elephant Stegodon, the Philippine deer, freshwater turtles, and monitor lizards.

It typically involves injecting malicious or malware-laden advertisements into legitimate online advertising networks and webpages. Online advertisements provide a solid platform for spreading malware because significant effort is put into them in order to attract users and sell or advertise the product. Because advertising content can be inserted into high-profile and reputable websites, malvertising provides malefactors an opportunity to push their attacks to web users who might not otherwise see the ads, due to firewalls, more safety precautions, or the like. Malvertising is \\"attractive to attackers because they 'can be easily spread across a large number of legitimate websites without directly compromising those websites'.\\" Malvertising is a fairly new concept for spreading malware and can be extremely hard to combat because it can quietly work its way into a webpage or advertisement on a webpage and spread unknowingly: \\"The interesting thing about infections delivered through malvertising is that it does not require any user action (like clicking) to compromise the system and it does not exploit any vulnerabilities on the website or the server it is hosted from... infections delivered through malvertising silently travel through Web page advertisements.\\" It is able to expose millions of users to malware, even the most cautious, and is growing rapidly: \\"In 2012, it was estimated nearly 10 billion ad impressions were compromised by malvertising.\\" Attackers have a very wide reach and are able to deliver these attacks easily through advertisement networks. Companies and websites have had difficulty diminishing the number of malvertising attacks, which \\"suggests that this attack vector isn‚Äôt likely to disappear soon.\\"  Overview  When websites or web publishers unknowingly incorporate corrupted or malicious advertisements into their page, computers can become infected pre-click and post-click. It is a misconception that infection only happens when visitors begin clicking on a malvertisement. \\"Examples of pre-click malware include being embedded in main scripts of the page or drive-by- downloads. Malware can also auto-run, as in the case of auto redirects, where the user is automatically taken to a different site (without user interaction, such as clicking on them), which could be malicious. Malware can also be found in the delivery of an ad ‚Äì where a clean ad that has no malware pre- or post- click (in its build and design) can still be infected whilst being called. Malicious code can hide undetected and the user has no idea what's coming their way. A post-click malvertisement example: \\"the user clicks on the ad to visit the advertised site, and instead is directly infected or redirected to a malicious site. These sites trick users into copying viruses or spyware usually disguised as Flash files, which are very popular on the web.\\" Redirection is often built into online advertising, and this spread of malware is often successful because users expect a redirection to happen when clicking on an advertisement. A redirection that is taking place only needs to be co- opted in order to infect a user's computer. Malvertising often involves the exploitation of trustworthy companies. Those attempting to spread malware place \\"clean\\" advertisements on trustworthy sites first in order to gain a good reputation, then they later \\"insert a virus or spyware in the code behind the ad, and after a mass virus infection is produced, they remove the virus\\", thus infecting all visitors of the site during that time period. The identities of those responsible are often hard to trace, making it hard to prevent the attacks or stop them altogether, because the \\"ad network infrastructure is very complex with many linked connections between ads and click-through destinations.\\" Some malvertisements can infect a vulnerable computer even if the user never clicks on the (normal-appearing) advertisement.  History  2007/2008: The first recorded sighting of malvertising was in late 2007 / early 2008. This threat was based on a vulnerability in Adobe Flash (something that has continued into the late 2010s) and affected a number of platforms including, MySpace, Excite and Rhapsody. 2009: The online edition of The New York Times Magazine was found to be serving up an ad that was part of a larger click fraud scam that created a botnet network of malware infected computers, nicknamed the Bahama botnet, that then went on to be used to carry out click fraud on pay per click ads all over the web. The banner feed of The New York Times was hacked for the weekend of September 11 to 14, causing some readers to see advertisements telling them their systems were infected and trying to trick them into installing rogue security software on their computers. According to spokeswoman Diane McNulty, \\"the culprit approached the newspaper as a national advertiser and had provided apparently legitimate ads for a week\\", and the ads were switched to the virus alert malvertisement afterwards. The New York Times then suspended third-party advertisements to address the problem, and even posted advice for readers regarding this issue on its technology blog. 2010: Malvertising takes off. Marketing analysts ClickZ noted that the Online Trust Alliance (OTA) identified billions of display ads, across 3500 sites carrying malware. In the same year the Online Trust Alliance formed a cross industry Anti-Malvertising Task Force. 2011: Spotify had a malvertising attack which used the Blackhole exploit kit ‚Äì this was one of the first instances of a drive-by download, where a user doesn‚Äôt even have to click on an ad to become infected with malware. According to Blue Coat Systems 2012 Web Security Report, 2011 saw an increase of 240% in malvertising based malicious sites. 2012: Symantec includes malvertising as a section in their Internet Security Threat Report 2013 which looked back at the landscape in 2012. Symantec used scanning software across a series of websites and detected that half of them were infected with malvertising. In 2012, the LA Times was hit by a massive malvertising attack which used the Blackhole exploit kit to infect users. It was seen as part of a general campaign of malvertising to hit large news portals ‚Äì this strategy carried on into subsequent years with attacks on huffingtonpost.com and the NY Times. 2013: A major malvertising campaign was waged against Yahoo.com, one of the largest ad platforms with monthly visits of 6.9 billion. The malware exploit was based on the commonly used web attack, Cross-site scripting (XSS), number three in the top ten web attacks types identified by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). The attack infected users' machines with the ransomware, ‚ÄòCryptowall‚Äô, a type of malware that extorts money from users by encrypting their data and placing a ransom of up to $1000 in bitcoins, to be paid in 7 days, to decrypt the data. 2014: In 2014 there were major malvertising campaigns on the DoubleClick and Zedo ad networks. Various news portals, including The Times of Israel and the Hindustan Times, were affected. As in previous attacks the cybercrime involved Cryptowall as the malware infection. This spate of malvertising was believed to have brought over $1 million of ransom money in by infecting over 600,000 computers. 2015: McAfee's Threat Report for February 2015 said that malvertising was growing quickly on mobile platforms. In 2015 there were malvertising campaigns on eBay, Answers.com, talktalk.co.uk, and wowhead.com, among others. The campaigns involved breaches of ad networks, including DoubleClick and engage:BDR. There was also a report of possibly the first \\"political malvertising\\" campaign by pro-Russian activists, which was based on a botnet, which then forced users machines to visit bogus sites that generated ad revenue for the activists. The users also ended up at several pro-Russian propaganda videos.  More examples of malicious advertisements  Several popular websites and news sources have been victims to malvertising and have had malicious advertisements placed on their webpages or widgets unknowingly, including Horoscope.com, The New York Times, the London Stock Exchange, Spotify, and The Onion.  Types and modes  By visiting websites that are affected by malvertising, users are at risk of infection. There are many different methods used for injecting malicious advertisements or programs into webpages: * Pop-up ads for deceptive downloads, such as fake anti-virus programs that install malicious software on the computer *In-text or in- content advertising * Drive-by downloads * Web widgets in which redirection can be co-opted into redirecting to a malicious site * Hidden iframes that spread malware into websites * Content delivery networks exploited to share malware * Malicious banners on websites * Third-party advertisements on webpages * Third-party applications, such as forums, help desks, and customer relationship management and content management systems = Preventive measures = There are several precautions that people can take to reduce their chances of getting tricked by these advertisements. Commonly used programs such as Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Reader can have their flaws exploited, and become vulnerable to attacks, so it is important to avoid them, or at least keep them up to date. Users can also download anti-virus software that protects against threats and removes malicious software from their systems. Users can also push companies and websites to scan advertisements before making them active on their webpages. Users can also use ad blocking software to avoid downloading the malware contained in advertisements or a specific browser extension alerting malvertising campaigns.

It was built about 1835 and subsequently expanded and modified. The house consists of a two-story brick main block with two-story brick wing. The interior retains a number of notable Greek Revival treatments dating to the period of original construction. Also on the property is a frame privy and cast iron fence. See also: It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2010.  History  A 1788 portrait by Ralph Earl, believed to be of Robert Boyd, Jr., gifted by the van Kleeck Family, his descendants The house sits on the former farm of patriot Robert Boyd, Jr. (1734 ‚Äî 1804). In June of 1775, Boyd built a water-powered forge on the south side of the nearby Vale of Avoca. He was a Scottish immigrant to New Windsor before the Revolutionary War, and with his father, Robert Boyd, Sr. (1703 ‚Äî 1786), continued their trade as blacksmiths. After 1761, they obtained a hundred-acre farm on the northern end of William Chamber's patent. Boyd's gun smithery manufactured bayonets, gun barrels muskets, as he had received a contract from the revolutionary authorities to produce them. He was paid three pounds and fifteen shillings. By February 1776, their gun smithery was remarked as one of the best in the colonies. However, he had difficulty with assistance at the forge, and sent agents abroad to secure more workmen, a mission that proved to be unsuccessful. He was a member of the New Windsor Committee of Safety, along with Samuel Brewster, a blacksmith on Moodna Creek. After the Revolution, he converted the works into a plaster mill and retired. In 1790, George Clinton sold his grist and saw mill in the Vale to Hugh Walsh, who extended his property to Boyd's. The Havemeyer family were German entrepreneurs who owned property in New Windsor that they maintained in the summer months.

It had roots in a 1930s informal oppositional group within the Norwegian labour movement. The informal group was led by H√•kon Meyer, and was more radical than the mainstream labour movement. On 9 April 1940 Germany invaded Norway, and subsequently occupied the country. The mainstream labour movement was now engaged in fighting and opposing a German rule. However, the grouping around H√•kon Meyer wanted to steer the labour movement in another direction; taking advantage of the occupation to make conditions for laborers more favourable. The grouping was soon supported by some members of the radical Communist Party of Norway, and by non-partisan trade unionists such as Halvard Olsen. Fagopposisjonen av 1940 was founded as a formal group on 15 June 1940. Meyer and Olsen were leading figures, Jens Tangen headed the executive committee. The other members of the executive committee were Meyer, H. Olsen, Erling Olsen, Martin Brendberg, Adelstein Haugen and Albert Johannessen. It was staunchly opposed by the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO) and official organs of the labour movement; LO officially denounced Fagopposisjonen av 1940 as \\"underminers\\" on 26 July. Around August‚ÄìSeptember the group was split in two. One part, led by H√•kon Meyer, started accepting the Norwegian Fascist party Nasjonal Samling (who had taken power for a few days in April) as a cooperation partner. The other part disassociated itself with the Nazi rule.

Originally from St Andrew Holborn, Day went under the name Marmaduke Davenport, Esq. and hired a carriage and footman to create the impression to shopkeepers in London that he was a respected member of the gentry. Once the shop proprietors had supplied their goods, Day would flee without paying. In 1723, Day was arrested in connection with a robbery of a mail coach in Clapham. Although he was ruled out as a suspect of this crime, he was indicted on four counts of defrauding and two counts of grand larceny for crimes committed in the September of the previous year. After his trial, Day was found guilty on all counts of defrauding and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment at Newgate Prison, which included standing twice in the pillory and paying a fine of ¬£200. Criminal career Alexander Day originated from the parish of St Andrew, Holborn. He worked as a sharper in London, where he went under the pseudonym Marmaduke Davenport Esq. to suggest that he was a member of the gentry. To further this claim, Day would say that he had a large estate in Durham and was engaged to a wealthy heiress. Day also claimed to have left his own coachman and horses at his country seat and needed to hire a carriage and footman in London. Once he had hired the carriage and footman, he took this entourage around numerous premises in the city, where he would convince shopkeepers that he was about to spend large amounts of money on their expensive goods. This perceived wealth and social status led him to be able to gain credit on purchases. Day would take delivery of upper-class items at his rented Queen Square property, but would fail to pay. Historian Hannah Grieg hypothesises that Day may have previously spent time in Bath, Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh, where he practised his craft and stole goods to furnish his London home and further convince his victims of his wealth. Arrest and trial In 1723, Day was arrested on suspicion of robbing the Bristol mail coach at Clapham, though subsequent investigations ruled him out as a suspect. During this time, he was indicted on four counts of defrauding and two counts of grand larceny. These charges referred to crimes committed in September 1722, which included: # the theft of gold and silver lace to the value of ¬£55,First indictment # the defrauding of Thomas Gravestock, the proprietor of the gold and silver lace,Second indictment # the defrauding of Samuel Scrimpshaw for cambric valued at ¬£48,Third indictment # the defrauding of George Kendrick for tea valued at ¬£51,Fourth indictment # the \\"felonious\\" theft of of rich brocade, of cherry-powdered podesay and of white podesay at a combined value of ¬£34,Fifth indictment # the defrauding of a Mr. Hinchliff, the proprietor of the brocade and podesay.Sixth indictment During the trial, Day stated that he had stolen to keep up with annual ¬£200 payments on his Durham estate, which was mortgaged for ¬£1,200, but he was unable to provide evidence of the Durham estate and could not provide a witness willing to testify to his reputation. The court did not believe his defence and he was found guilty of defrauding all persons in the case. On 24 April 1723, Day was sentenced to two years' imprisonment at Newgate Prison. This would include standing twice in the pillory, as well as a fine of ¬£200. He would then be under probation for the two years following his release. Peter King of the Open University identifies that Day's first pillory was in Covent Garden, where he was surrounded by a large crowd and was severely pelted with rotten vegetables and faeces for an hour. A newspaper report published after Day's sentence stated that he was \\"a great master of his profession [who] would not be at liberty to follow his former profession any longer\\". The second pillory took place at Ludgate Hill.

He poses as the notorious gangster Garou-Garou to attempt to woo her affections, but is arrested and sent to prison. As a prisoner he annoys the guards by walking in and out of his cell, and keeps asking Susan to cease her criminal way of life.

It is a departure from the concept of mimesis which only is concerned with \\"imitation of nature\\" instead of the \\"imitation of other authors.\\" History Three centuries after Aristotle's Poetics, from the 4th century BCE to the 1st century BCE, the meaning of mimesis as a literary method had shifted from \\"imitation of nature\\" to \\"imitation of other authors\\". No historical record is left to explain the reason of this change. Dionysius' three volume work On mimesis (On imitation), which was the most influential for Latin authors, is lost. Most of it contained advice on how to identify the most suitable writers to imitate and the best way to imitate them.Ruthven (1979) pp. 103‚Äì4 For Dionysian imitatio, the object of imitation was not a single author but the qualities of many.West (1979) pp.5‚Äì8 Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' imitatio and discarded Aristotle's mimesis; the imitation literary approach is closely linked with the widespread observation that \\"everything has been said already\\", which was also stated by Egyptian scribes around 2000 BCE. The ideal aim of this approach to literature was not originality, but to surpass the predecessor by improving their writings and set the bar to a higher level. A prominent Latin follower of Dionysius was Quintilian, who shared with him the view of imitatio as the practice that leads to an historical progress of literature over time. Both Dionysius and Quintilian discuss imitation exclusively from the point of view of rhetoric. In Quintilian, and in classical rhetoric in general, rhetoric drew much attention to the process of imitatio; the four operations of quadripartita ratio that organize all the figures of speech, defined as a \\"ready-made framework\\" of \\"relatively mechanical procedures\\" for the emulation, adaptation, reworking and enrichment of a source text by an earlier author.Jansen (2008), quote from the summary: This view of rhetoric was taken by Erasmus in De Copia Rerum.  Mimesis  Dionysius' concept marked a significant departure from the concept of mimesis formulated by Aristotle in the 4th century BCE, which was only concerned with \\"imitation of nature\\" instead of the \\"imitation of other authors.\\" Latin orators and rhetoricians adopted the literary method of Dionysius' imitatio and discarded Aristotle's mimesis. In Aristotle's Poetics, lyric poetry, epic poetry, drama, dancing, painting are all described as forms of mimesis.

Cooperation began growing significantly during the Presidency of Hugo Ch√°vez of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the tenure of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao as the leader of the People's Republic of China. Sino-Venezuelan trade was less than $500m per year before 1999, and reached $7.5bn in 2009, making China Venezuela's second-largest trade partner,Venezuelanalysis.com, 3 August 2010, Latest Venezuela-China Deals: Orinoco Agriculture, Civil Aviation, Steel, and $5 Billion Credit Line and Venezuela is China's biggest investment destination in Latin America.

Formal diplomatic relations between the Chinese and Venezuelan governments were established in August 1944, with offices opened in Caracas and Nanking, the capital of the Republic of China. After the Communists taking power in 1949, the Venezuelan office was transplanted from Nanking to Taipei, the capital of Taiwan Province. In 1966, the office was upgraded into an embassy. In 1974, Venezuela ended recognition of the ROC and switched to recognizing the People's Republic of China instead. Before 1999, only one sitting Venezuelan president had visited the PRC: Luis Herrera Campins in 1981. As a result, up until 1999 there had only been 19 formal agreements between China and Venezuela, and only two of these would be ratified by both sides.R√≠os, Xulio. ‚ÄúChina and Venezuela: Ambitions and Complexities of an Improving Relationship.‚Äù East Asia, vol. 30, no. 1, 6 Jan. 2013, p. 59., doi:10.1007/s12140-012-9185-0.  Ch√°vez administration (1999-2013)  The nature of Sino-Venezuelan relations completely changed once Hugo Ch√°vez won the 1998 Venezuelan Presidential elections. From the outset of his presidency, Hugo Ch√°vez sought to distance himself from the United States and court other allies that could help him find alternative sources of trade, diplomatic and military relations. During the first year of his presidency, he visited China and would accumulate the greatest number of visits to China out of any other Latin-American leader during the same period (1999-2012).Dominguez, Jorge I. ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Relations With Latin America: Shared Gains, Asymmetric Hopes.‚Äù Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, 1 June 2006, p. 41 wcfia.harvard.edu/publications/chinas-relations-latin-america- shared-gains-asymmetric-hopes. While giving a speech at Beijing University, Ch√°vez is reported to have stated that ‚Äúthe Bolivarian Revolution is rooted in the ideology of Communist China‚Äôs founder, Mao Zedong‚Äù. During that same visit, Ch√°vez also proclaimed that Simon Bolivar was a ‚Äúsoul mate of Mao Zedong‚Äù.Dominguez, Jorge I. ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Relations With Latin America: Shared Gains, Asymmetric Hopes.‚Äù Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, 1 June 2006, p. 44 wcfia.harvard.edu/publications/chinas-relations-latin-america- shared-gains-asymmetric-hopes. While Sino-Venezuelan relations were not strong at the time of Hugo Ch√°vez's 1999 election, by his third term in 2012 the alliance between these socialist regimes were stronger than ever before. In terms of their diplomatic ties, Venezuela became a supporter of China on issues relating to Iran and North Korea; and they also publicly supported the creation of an international currency, which is a position that China favored. In March 2005, China passed the Anti-Secession Law which prevents Taiwan from declaring independence. Venezuela was one of the few Latin American countries to support China's actions saying that the law is fully in accordance with the basic principles of the UN Charter. The Ch√°vez government also added that Venezuela will stick to the \\"one-China\\" principle and support China's efforts in achieving territorial integrity and national reunification. According to Foreign Minister Al√≠ Rodr√≠guez Araque, the adoption of the law will contribute strengthening ties across the Taiwan Straits and also opening a channel for peaceful reunification through direct talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. Chavez has been called a 'strong and vibrant leader' and 'good friend of the Chinese people.'  Maduro administration (2013-present)  In March 2013 Hugo Ch√°vez died. In April, a special presidential election was held, and Ch√°vez's vice president, Nicol√°s Maduro won. In 2017, the Supreme Tribunal of Venezuela removed power from the elected National Assembly, resulting in a constitutional crisis and protests that year.

The US, Canada, and most of Western Europe and Latin America (including Brazil, Colombia, Argentina) recognized Guaid√≥ as interim president.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. However, China and Russia have continued to voice support for Maduro and have accused of the US of interfering in Venezuela's domestic affairs amid the ongoing turmoil. Iran has also condemned US threats, while a few Latin American countries such as Cuba and Bolivia also continue to back the Maduro administration. On the other hand, the ROC was among the several countries to support Juan Guaid√≥ and the opposition-led National Assembly in its calls to restore democracy. Through its Twitter account, the Foreign Ministry quoted that \\"Taiwan stands with the forces of freedom\\" while calling for \\"the democratic order to be restored\\" in Venezuela. In February 2019, China alongside Russia vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for new presidential elections in Venezuela. During the crisis in Venezuela, China supplied riot-control equipment to Venezuelan authorities combatting the protests in Venezuela. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, China has also financially assisted Venezuela through its economic crisis. Trade and investments (1999-present) In 2001, Venezuela was the first Hispanic country to enter a 'strategic development partnership' with China. From 2003 until 2012 Sino-Venezuelan economic ties grew exponentially stronger. The amount of bilateral trade between China and Venezuela expanded about 24-fold from $742,417,000 in 2003 to $20 billion in 2012. Moreover, during this same time period, Venezuela became China's fourth largest supplier of oil. In April 2010 China agreed to extend $20 billion in loans to Venezuela. Venezuela outlined the role of the venture as one which would link Venezuela's oil producing regions and agricultural farming areas. In September 2009 Venezuela announced a new $16bn deal with China to drill for oil in a joint venture with PDVSA to produce of extra heavy crude. Hugo Ch√°vez stated that \\"In addition, there will be a flood of technology into the country, with China going to build drilling platforms, oil rigs, railroads, houses.\\"Al Jazeera, 17 September 2009, Venezuela-China sign $16bn oil deal = Oil = Although Venezuela has the greatest amount of oil reserves outside of the Middle East, the type of oil it produces, it's geographical location, and its relationship with the US inhibited Chavez's administration's ability to increase oil exports to China. The biggest obstacle Ch√°vez faced in exporting Venezuelan oil to China was due to the fact that during the early 2000s, China did not have the machinery in their refineries capable of processing the highly sulfurous Venezuelan oil.Ratliff, William. ‚ÄúBeijing's Pragmatism Meets Hugo Chavez.‚Äù The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 12, no. 2, 2006, p. 78., www.jstor.org/stable/24590620?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents. This meant that the only oil that China was interested in importing was a specific type of low-grade oil called ‚Äúorimulsion‚Äù which was mainly used to make asphalt.Ratliff, William. ‚ÄúBeijing's Pragmatism Meets Hugo Chavez.‚Äù The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 12, no. 2, 2006, p. 79., www.jstor.org/stable/24590620?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents. Another factor that constrained Venezuela's ability to export its oil to China was the size of Venezuela's oil shipment tankers. The tankers were simply too big to fit through the Panama Canal and would have to take a longer route that traversed the Cape of Good Hope, South Africa. The final obstacle to the exportation of oil was a diplomatic one. Since about 60 percent of Venezuela's oil exports were going to the United States, Chinese officials were worried that by buying more oil that they would become involved in the disputes between Chavez's anti-US regime and the Bush administration.Ratliff, William. ‚ÄúBeijing's Pragmatism Meets Hugo Chavez.‚Äù The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 12, no. 2, 2006, p. 80., www.jstor.org/stable/24590620?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents. Because of these factors, in 2005, Venezuela was only exporting 140,000 barrels of crude orimulsion per day. In addition, Venezuela made up only 2 percent of China's imports and exports in 2003.Ratliff, William. ‚ÄúBeijing's Pragmatism Meets Hugo Chavez.‚Äù The Brown Journal of World Affairs, vol. 12, no. 2, 2006, pp. 79., www.jstor.org/stable/24590620?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents. In September 2008, Venezuela signed a series of energy co-operation deals with China with Hugo Ch√°vez stating that oil exports could rise threefold by 2012, to . However, by 2012, underinvestment in the oil sector meant that only 640,000 barrels of oil a day were exported to China and 200,000 of those simply went to service Venezuela's huge debts to China.\\"Hugo Chavez leaves Venezuela in economic muddle.\\" During the first quarter of 2018, only 381,300 barrels of oil were being exported.Aizhu, Chen, and Florence Tan. ‚ÄúVenezuela Oil Exports to China Slump, May Hit Lowest in Nearly 8 Years: Sources, Data.‚Äù Reuters, 15 June 2018, www.reuters.com/article/us-china-venezuela-oil/venezuela-oil-exports-to- china-slump-may-hit-lowest-in-nearly-8-years-sources-data-idUSKBN1JB0YI. In February 2009 Venezuela and China agreed to double their joint investment fund to $12 billion and signed agreements to boost co-operation which include increasing oil exports from Venezuela, China's fourth biggest oil provider. An oil refinery is planned be built in China to handle Venezuelan heavy crude from the Orinoco basin. \\"It is part of a strategic alliance\\" Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez said, after meeting the visiting Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping who stated that \\"our co-operation is highly beneficial\\". On 19 October 2018, Maduro promised to raise oil exports to China and Russia to one million barrels a day, 'rain or shine'. = Infrastructure, tech, and industry = Further trade agreements worth $12bn were signed in February 2009, and Venezuela's first cell phone factory, built with Chinese support, was inaugurated.Venezuelanalysis.com, 18 February 2009, China, Venezuela Boost Economic Cooperation with US$ 12 Billion Fund In 2009, China entered into a partnership with Venezuela to launch a railway company in Venezuela which will be 40% controlled by the China Railways Engineering Corporation (CREC) and the remainder by Venezuela.

Of the $150 billion the Chinese Development Bank loaned to Latin America in the past 12 years, a third went to Venezuela.  Military  Their military relations also improved under Ch√°vez. During Ch√°vez's administration, China started selling various military products, such as radars and aircraft, and also began performing bilateral military training activities in Venezuela. According to a 2019 report China has sold $615 million in weapons in the past ten years.

It stars Litzy, Mauricio Ochmann, Roberto Mateos, Alejandro Felipe, and Carla Peterson. It was written by Enrique Torres, directed by Heriberto Lopez de Anda, Cristina Palacios, Hugo A. Moser; with Cristina Palacios as General Producer. The network debuted it on April 5, 2005, at the 7 pm (6 pm central) timeslot. Telemundo provided both Spanish and English captions on CC1 and CC 3. This telenovela was aired in 20 countries around the world, including in Indonesia by the tv station Indosiar as midnight show during 2009. In Haiti, the telenovela was a big success in January 2010 and was shown at 5PM. With typical Haitian humour, some say that Frijolito killed many people as the earthquake that shattered the island nation on January 12, 2010 occurred right before 5PM. Plot Amarte as√≠ is a sentimental comedy or melodrama. As a teenager in Mexico, Nacho (Mauricio Ochmann) discovered that he could seduce girls by giving them gold rings. With his buddy Lucho, Nacho fornicated with many, many girls, and then never went out with them again. Sometimes Lucho \\"helped\\" Nacho by putting a date rape drug in the girl's drink, though Nacho was not aware of this. Being from a rich family, when Nacho finished high school, he went to Los Angeles to study medicine, not knowing that on his last night in Mexico he had impregnated Margarita (Litzy). Lucho had actually drugged both Nacho and Margarita, leading to lack of inhibition and fornication. In the morning Margarita woke up naked and abandoned. She could not find Nacho. Margarita had been permanently enamored by Nacho the night that she met him, but she also hated him for having impregnated her and abandoned her. She thought that he had drugged her, but actually neither she nor Nacho remembered the fornication, though she had constructed mental images of herself being raped. Through Lucho, Nacho's brother Francisco (Roberto Mateos) offered money to Margarita to pay for killing Margarita's unborn baby. But Margarita refused. Thus while Nacho was spending six years in LA, Margarita at the age of 15 gave birth to Frijolito. All the above is shown by flashbacks, and what happened in the past is only revealed in bits and pieces here and there during the telenovela. The telenovela begins with Nacho returning to Esperanza, Mexico, not remembering Margarita nor knowing that he has a son. Since Margarita lies like Pinocchio (nickname Do√±a Mentiras), the truth comes out only slowly. Generally Nacho is the last to know, which adds to the comedy. The plot is cyclical. It follows this pattern: 1) Margarita is in a snit vs. Nacho, 2) Margarita melts, 3) love blazes between the two, 4) Margarita gets angry again vs. Nacho and goes back into a snit vs. him. There are about 9 cycles of this. All of this is shown with some extremely beautiful love music in the background. Generally the story is presented in distinct days, showing persons going to bed and getting up in the morning. Usually the format pretends that Saturdays and Sundays do not exist. The story seems to cover over a year in time, as defined by two birthdays of Dulce, the first at the start of the story. There are a plethora of people with unknown or mistaken parentage in the story. It employs the well-worn plot device of two brothers after the same woman, and the hero (engaged to a blond villainess) who falls in love with a Cinderella. Margarita takes a job as a nanny and then as a servant in the Reyes mansion, where Nacho, Francisco, and Chantal (Carla Peterson) live, along with Chantal's wicked witch mother. The two protagonists come close to marrying the wrong persons in a double wedding, which collapses as a farce when Margarita arrives drunk, and Nacho kisses her in the church during the ceremony, though both were supposed to marry others. The two brothers have a duel over this. The climax comes when Frijolito is kidnapped. Desperate for ransom money, Margarita confesses to Nacho that Frijolito is his son. She explains to him what he did to her when she was 15. After this climax, the two are united lovers for the rest of the telenovela, which does not end at that point. Attempts are made to kill both Nacho and Margarita by the wicked Chantal. At the end they marry and live happily ever after, like one-winged eagles who must cling to each other in order to fly. For Nacho is left with a dangerous bullet near his spine and Margarita has a chronic heart valve problem.

Peshkar Productions is an intercultural theatre and multimedia art company based in the Northwest of England. It engages in participatory projects and professional productions. History Peshkar was initiated in 1991, through a series of Asian Arts workshops by Oldham Metropolitan Borough Council‚Äôs (OMBC) Arts Development programme. The workshops were based on Asian music, dance and drama, involving members of the local Asian community with little experience in the performing arts. The success of the workshops and the enthusiasm of the participants led to the formation of Peshkar as a company with a role to promote the arts within the local Asian community by providing a forum for cultural expression. Between 1991 and 1998 the company operated as a project within the OMBC Arts and Events Unit, gaining funding from North West Arts Board and other local funding sources to run a series of participatory workshop programmes and theatre productions employing a professional creative team to work with Peshkar‚Äôs growing company of participants from the local community. In 2001 Peshkar secured support from the European Regional Development Fund, which allowed it to constitute the organisation as a Company Limited by Guarantee and a Registered Charity, and develop a business plan that would build on the company‚Äôs growing reputation as a regionally significant Asian Arts organisation. It secured Revenue Funding from North West Arts Board and the first full-time company director was appointed in November 2000. In 2006, Jim Johnson (theatre-maker/musician) took over as CEO and Artistic Director of Peshkar. [1] Since then, the company have continued to make work on a multi- platform basis, expanding their remit to targeting young people from a diverse range of hard to reach backgrounds. In 2008, Sophia Rashid's 'Dance Without Movement' was reprised at the Edinburgh Fringe. It was directed by Jim Johnson, produced by Bryan Savery and starring Yamina Peerzada from the Rafi Theatre Workshop of Pakistan as Zuhleikah, taking over from Poppy Jakhra from the production's original tour the previous year. In 2010, following a research trip to Bangladesh, Peshkar embarked on a large-scale project entitled 'FutureDesh' which looked at issues around climate change, the impact in Bangladesh and how it related to young people in the UK. The 'FutureDesh' project yielded two touring theatre pieces both directed by Jim Johnson with digital design by Tristan Brady-Jacobs and set design by Christopher Keech, with music also composed by Jim Johnson under the guise of his musical pseudonym 'Jimmy's Big Tears.' The first of these productions which was co- produced with Yorkshire theatre company Red Ladder, and written by Nick Ahad, caused some controversy when Philip Davies, the Conservative MP for Shipley, wrote to the Education Minister Michael Gove complaining about the production which toured schools across the Pennine Lancs area, promoting the Climate Change agenda. Despite not actually having seen the play, and without the term 'climate change' ever being discussed or referred to in the play, BBC Radio in Yorkshire hosted a debate featuring both Davies and Red Ladder's Artistic Director Rod Dixon. The follow up production in the 'FutureDesh' project was Sudha Bhuchar's 'Small Fish Big Cheese' and was staged at the Unicorn Theatre in January 2012. Peshkar was awarded Arts Council National Portfolio status for the period 2012-2015.

It is considered one of the most beautiful and unique monuments of industrial architecture in Poland. It owes its exceptionalness to the four-wing mill, the building of the Old Boiler House in the middle of a big courtyard, a high chimney, two dust towers and two water-towers. The process of renovating and adjusting the White Factory to the museum's objectives began in 1955, when authorities took a decision to designate it as the future location of the museum. In 2008, the Central Museum of Textiles was extended by establishing an Open-air Museum of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Wooden Architecture. Activities The scientific, collection, and promotional interests of the museum concentrate around everything related to textile manufacturing process ‚Äì from materials and textile techniques and technologies through to textiles products representing various degrees of processing. Collections are gathered, scientifically elaborated, conserved and, in various forms, displayed by the specialized thematic departments of the museum. Since 1972 the museum has cooperated in organising the International Triennial of Tapestry, which it has been the sole host of since 1982. Presently, it is the oldest and biggest world international exhibition-competition promoting contemporary \\"fibre art\\". The museum is also the sole organizer and exhibitor of several national events ‚Äì the National Exhibition of the Polish Tapestry (since 2004), the National Exhibition of the Polish Miniature Textiles (since 1998), and the National Exhibition of the Polish Cross-Stitch Embroidery of Amateur Artists (since 2000).

History  = First World War = The squadron's origins The 9√®me Escadrille de Chasse was originally the 1√®re Escadrille de Chasse, which was founded in February 1916 as the first dedicated fighter squadron of the Aviation Militaire Belge. On 1 March 1918, while stationed at Les Mo√´res aerodrome near Veurne, it would be reorganized into the 9√®me Escadrille and become part of Belgium's first fighter wing, the Groupe de Chasse. The squadron continued to use the equipment and personnel of the 1√®re Escadrille. 9√®me Escadrille also inherited the \\"Thistle\\" symbol and motto \\"Nemo me impune lacessit\\" or \\"No-one can challenge me unpunished\\". The squadron's fleet consisted largely of Hanriot-Dupont 1s, supplemented by a some Sopwith Camels. The 10√®me Escadrille and 11√®me Escadrille were the other squadrons of the Group, also known as the Groupe Jaquet, after its commanding officer, Capitaine Fernand Jacquet. Headed by Capitaine Walter Gallez,Pieters, p. 23 9 Squadron counted a number of famous fighter pilots amongst its ranks: Willy Coppens (who was also the first Belgian pilot to use the \\"Cocotte\\" on his aircraft), Jan Olieslagers, Andr√© de Meulemeester.Pieters, pp. 23‚Äì24 { Jan Olieslagers posing in front of a Sopwith Camel of 9 Squadron Hanriot-Dupont 1 of 9 Squadron in 1919 A map of Belgium, locating the airfields on which 9th Squadron was stationed } Operations During the initial years of World War I, the Aviation Militaire Belge was based in the diminished remnant of a small country, and performed largely in support of a defensive army. Only in September 1918 did the Belgian Army advance.Pieters, pp. 9‚Äì10, 15, 17 To support the offensive, 9√®me Escadrille moved to Moerkerke near the Dutch border in October 1918.Pieters, pp. 23‚Äì24 At the end of the war, 9√®me Escadrille was credited with 51 verified aerial victories, 41 of which were enemy observation balloons.http://www.theaerodrome.com/services/belgium/9me.php Retrieved on 30 August 2010. In turn, it suffered three pilots wounded in action or captured.Pieters, pp. 14; 23‚Äì24 = Between the wars = After the armistice, 9 Squadron was stationed at Sint-Agatha-Berchem, in the outskirts of Brussels. In 1919, they moved again to Schaffen near Diest to be integrated in 2nd Group. The squadron equipment was augmented by Fokker D-VII aircraft, yielded by the Germans as compensation for damages during World War I. In March 1920, 9 Squadron was equipped with SPAD XIII aircraft, and together with 10 Squadron, made up 4th Group. Still at Schaffen, the Squadron received their new Nieuport-Delage 29 aircraft in July 1922, only to be transformed into 2 Squadron sometime during 1924.Blasons Familiers, p. 34 In 1935, the Squadrons at Bierset were re-organised into 9 Squadron and 11 Squadron of the 5th Group of the 1st Aeronautical Regiment. Initially still equipped with Br√©guet XIX, they soon received the Belgian Renard R 31 monoplane. Their mission changed from Bombardment to Observation. As of 1938, the \\"Sioux\\" symbol appeared on the aircraft, designed by Roger Delannay. On 9 Squadron aircraft the \\"Sioux\\" was surrounded by a blue circle.Blasons Familiers, p. 130 The squadron motto was \\"Tenacity\\". = Second World War = Just before the outbreak of World War II, 11 Squadron was assigned to 6th Group. 9 Squadron remained the only flying unit in the 5th Group which was now under command of Commander Breulhez. To improve mobility and the possibility of deployed operations, each group comprised a maintenance squadron, a field train of about 25 vehicles, and an anti-aircraft unit of 40mm Bofors guns. Commanded by Captain Lekeuche, 9 Squadron took an active part in the 18 days campaign. On the morning of 10 May, 9 Squadron rejoined its diversion airfield at Duras, few hours before Bierset was bombarded by Dornier 17's of the Luftwaffe. 9 Squadron was one of three squadrons that continued to fight until the surrender on 28 May 1940. Both \\"Sioux\\" squadrons (9 and 11) combined executed 54 combat missions, for a loss of three pilots and 11 aircraft.Sous nos Ailes, p.139 = Cold War = After the war, with the creation of the 7th Day Fighter Wing at Chi√®vres, 9 Squadron was resurrected under the command of Commander Demey. The other units of 7th Wing were 7 Squadron and 8 Squadrons. The Squadron crest represented the \\"Cocotte\\", originally painted on Willy Coppens‚Äô Nieuport 17 in 1917,Blasons Familiers, p. 43 but this time in silver on a green background. The associated motto was selected by Major Coppens in its French form \\"Boutez en avant\\" in 1936, and translated to the English \\"Get In\\" by 7th Wing Commander Major Van Lierde.Blasons Familiers, p. 44 Starting on Gloster Meteor F8 on 17 March 1952, the Squadron transformed to Hawker Hunter F4 in June 1956, only to be disbanded on 15 March 1957.  Training Squadron  = Sint Truiden = SF260 with 9 Squadron badge In 1971, a thorough revision of the Air Force training system called for the creation of new training squadrons. Re-created on 16, 9 November Squadron became part of the \\"Perfectioning Center\\" at Brustem, together with 7 Squadron and 11 Squadron. Its mission was to convert the new Instructor Pilots on the CM170 Fouga Magister, Lockheed T-33 and SF260 SIAI-Marchetti aircraft. The latter being employed at Goetsenhoven, the Squadron operated a detachment at that airfield. Although having received a new designation, the name of the former unit assuming the squadron's mission, \\"FFM\\" (Flight de Formation des Moniteurs) stuck until well into the next century. During the following years, the most noteworthy changes were the replacement of the CM170 and T-33 by the Dassault Alpha-Jet as from January 1980 and the transformation of the unit into the Training and Evaluation Center of the Instruction and Training Command on 28 June 1985. Although keeping the same insignia and still being in charge of the training of new instructors, the unit was now a Staff section, detached in the training units. It became more involved in the standardization of the training. On request of the Instruction Command, regular \\"STANEVAL\\" inspections were carried out. In 1993, the Air Force's SF260M were supplemented by 9 SF260D, that were equipped more extensively for instrument flying. Subsequently, the squadron's expert instructors developed a training course for the benefit of those requiring an introduction to civilian IFR flying. This mission also remains with the squadron until the present day. = Beauvechain =  1 Wing  On 19 November 1996, all training units were moved to Beauvechain Air Base, a former air defense base. A few years later, on 12 September 2000, the Air Force's Tactical and Training Commands merged into COMOPSAIR, and the TEC was transferred into the structure of 1st Wing. Meanwhile, its instructors took an active part in the integration process of the Alpha Jet avionics update. Although the insignia of the \\"Green Cocotte\\" had survived the different changes in organization, the \\"shadow\\" squadron number had slipped into oblivion. In early 2001, on request of the CO, Major Conte, the unit obtained once more its squadron number. Nevertheless, on 30 August 2001, the Squadron is disbanded, and the mission of Training and Evaluation Center is taken over by 7 Squadron. From 2001 to 2005, the Training and Evaluation Centre existed as part of the 1st Wing Staff. Although continuing to supervise the training process, the different courses were taken over by the training squadrons. After the move of the Alpha-Jets to Cazaux in 2004, on 14 November 2005,Het Belang van Limburg \\"Luchtmachtbasis Bevekom wuift de Alpha-Jet uit\\" 14 September 2005 the TEC returned to being a flying unit, and started once more training the new instructors on SF260. Slowly, the unit continued to evolve, first by taking on the IFR course again, later by hosting and supervising the Flying duties of several Staff Officers. This task became even more important after the phasing out of the Fouga Magister in September 2007.Het Belang van Limburg \\"Laatste vlucht van de Fouga\\" 26 June 2007 To acknowledge the unit's status as a flying squadron, it received the traditions and insignia of 9th Squadron on 21 February 2008.  Basic Flying Training School  After a further re-organisation of the Belgian Armed Forces, the A109BA helicopters of the Wing Heli, based at Bierset, moved to Beauvechain on 1 September 2010. The name and traditions of 1st Wing were handed over to the helicopter unit.La Libre Belgique: Les h√©licopt√®res Agusta en vol le 13 septembre. 25 August 2010 Both training squadrons (5 and 9) now constitute the Basic Flying Training School. Still based at Beauvechain, this school is now independent of 1st Wing.

It was in the part of the county of Middlesex that was within the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works. In 1889 it became part of the County of London and the district board functioned as a local authority under the London County Council. Area The district comprised the civil parishes of Hackney and Stoke Newington. Under the Metropolis Management Act 1855 any parish that exceeded 2,000 ratepayers was to be divided into wards; as such the parish of St John at Hackney within the Hackney District Boards of Works was divided into seven wards (electing vestrymen): No. 1 or Stamford Hill (15), No. 2 or West (18), No. 3 or De Beauvoir Town (18), No. 4 or Dalston (18), No. 5 or Hackney (18), No. 6 or Homerton (15) and No. 7 or South (18). In 1891 as its population had increased the parish of St Mary Stoke Newington was divided into five wards (electing vestrymen): Lordship (15), Church (15), Manor (12), Clissold (9) and Palatine (9). Abolition The district was abolished in 1894 with the vestry of each parish taking on local administration. Each parish would go on to form a metropolitan borough in the County of London in 1900.

Sent to the Azores to capture the annual Spanish treasure convoy, when a stronger Spanish fleet appeared off Flores, Howard ordered his ships to flee to the north,Paine p. 150 saving all of them except the galleon Revenge commanded by Admiral Sir Richard Grenville. After transferring his ill crew men onshore back to his ship, he led the Revenge in a rear guard action against 55 Spanish ships, allowing the English fleet to retire to safety. The crew of the Revenge sank and damaged several Spanish ships during a day and night running battle. The Revenge was boarded many times by different Spanish ships and repelled each attack successfully. When Admiral Sir Richard Grenville was badly wounded, his surviving crew surrendered. Alfred, Lord Tennyson wrote a poem about the battle entitled The Revenge: a Ballad of the Fleet.  Background  In order to impede a Spanish naval recovery after the Armada, Sir John Hawkins proposed a blockade of the supply of treasure being acquired from the Spanish Empire in the Americas by a constant naval patrol designed to intercept Spanish ships. Revenge was on such a patrol in the summer of 1591 under the command of Sir Richard Grenville. The Spanish, meanwhile, had dispatched a fleet of some 55 ships under Alonso de Baz√°n, having under his orders Generals Mart√≠n de Bertendona and Marcos de Aramburu.Fern√°ndez Duro p. 79 Baz√°n learned that the English were patrolling around the northern Azores. In late August 1591, having been joined by 8 Portuguese flyboats under Luis Coutinho, the Spanish fleet came upon the English. Howard's fleet was caught while undergoing repairs and when the crews, many of whom were suffering an epidemic of fever, were resting ashore.  Battle  19th-century view of the action Map of the engagement The last fight of the Revenge (James Cundee) Baz√°n tried to surprise the English fleet at anchor, but Sancho Pardo's vice-flagship lost their bowsprit, forcing the attack to be delayed. It was not until 5 PM when Baz√°n's ships bore down the channel which separated Flores and Corvo islands. Howard, alerted to the arrival of the Spanish, managed to slip away to sea. An exchange of fire took place between both fleets before they became separated. Grenville, however, preferred to fight and went straight through the Spaniards, who were approaching from the eastward. Meanwhile, Defiance, Howard's flagship, received heavy gunfire from Aramburu's San Crist√≥bal before withdrawing from the battle. Revenge was left behind and directly engaged by Claudio de Viamonte's San Felipe. Viamonte boarded the English galleon, suffering the misfortune of the grappling hook parting after having only passed 10 men aboard her. Shortly after Mart√≠n de Bertendona's San Bernab√© did the same, this time successfully, and managed to rescue seven survivors of San Felipe¬¥s boarding party. San Bernab√©¬¥s grappling was decisive to the fate of Revenge, because the English warship lost the advantage of her long-range naval guns. Conversely, the heavy musketry fire of the Spanish infantry forced the English gunners to abandon their post in order to repulse the attack. At dusk, having dispersed the bulk of the English fleet, San Cristobal rammed Revenge underneath its aft-castle, putting on board of the English ship a second boarding party which captured her colours. The Spanish soldiers got as far forward as the mainmast before being forced to retreat due to the heavy musketry fire from the aftcastle. San Crist√≥bal's bow had been shattered by the ramming and she had to ask for reinforcements. Antonio Manrique's Asunci√≥n and Luis Coutinho's flyboat La Serena attacked then at the same time, increasing the number of ships beating the Revenge to five, which was still grappled by the galleons San Bernab√© and the damaged San Crist√≥bal. Grenville held them back with cannon and musket fire until, being himself badly injured and Revenge severely damaged, completely dis-masted and with 150 men killed or unable to fight, surrendered. During the night Manrique's and Coutinho's ships sank after they collided with each other.  Aftermath  Despite the damage Grenville had inflicted, the Spanish treated Revenge's survivors honourably.Simpson p. 101 Grenville, who had been taken aboard Baz√°n's flagship, died two days later. The Spanish Treasure Fleet rendezvoused with Baz√°n soon after, and the combined fleet sailed to Spain. They were overtaken by a week-long storm during which Revenge and 15 Spanish warships and merchant vessels were lost. Revenge sank with her mixed prize-crew of 70 Spaniards and English prisoners near the island of Terceira, at the approximate position .Earle p. 159 The battle, however, marked the resurgence of Spanish naval powerHammer p. 166 and proved that the English chances of catching and defeating a well-defended treasure fleet were remote. It also hinted at what might have happened in Gravelines in 1588 if Medina Sidonia had succeeded in luring the English ships within grappling range of the Armada, and if the cannonballs had actually fit the Spanish cannon (they'd been manufactured in different areas of the Spanish Habsburg Empire and so were not all designed in the same way, shape, or size).

Willenbacher studied physics and founded the company juwi together with Fred Jung in 1996. He was a member of the Executive Board of juwi AG from its founding until March 31, 2015. He is one of the protagonists shown in the film Die 4. Revolution ‚Äì Energy Autonomy, and with his enterprise one of the main sponsors of the film. Together with his partner Fred Jung he was awarded 'Greentech Manager des Jahres' in 2009 by the German magazine Capital. Willenbacher and Jung established the 100 percent renewable foundation in 2008. With this charitable foundation, the founders want to make a contribution to environmental protection by promoting the use of renewable energies. In June 2013, his book Mein immoralisches Angebot an die Kanzlerin appeared, in which he offered Angela Merkel to give away his company shares to Germany's 500 citizen energy cooperatives if the German Chancellor implements a 100 percent, decentralized energy turnaround by 2020. In the book Willenbacher outlines a relatively detailed master plan on how Germany can be supplied with 100 % electricity from renewable sources. Key points are an increase in the full load hours of wind and solar energy plants and a mix of energy sources from 60 % wind power, 25 % solar energy, 5 % hydroelectric power and 10 % combined heat and power plants that are to be operated from sustainable sources. As co- editor, together with Claudia Kemfert, , Michael M√ºller and Gero L√ºcking, Willenbacher regularly wrote a column in the online magazine klimaretter.info until 2014. Among other things, he pleaded for true costs for fossil fuels and pointed to their hidden environmental costs, which in his opinion are not reflected in the production price for electricity generation. He called for a fuel tax for conventional power plants as an alternative to the ineffective emissions trading system in order to accelerate the energy turnaround: \\"This would finally allow conventional power plants to contribute adequately to the costs of environmental remediation, the safe disposal of radioactive waste and the fight against emission-related health damage. We will then use technology to create a better world: a world in which the energy supply is exclusively clean, with a mix of wind and solar energy, hydroelectric power, bioenergy and geothermal energy. A world in which energy prices are low and remain stable in the long term, because wind and solar energy are free and infinitely available everywhere.\\" According to Willenbacher, he is the first European to own a Tesla Roadster.

Their distillery has the tallest rectification column in Europe, possibly the world.HairyBikers' Best of British, BBC2, 19:00 Wednesday 3 April. Company history The Chase Distillery, the UK‚Äôs first single-estate distillery, was founded on a farm in Herefordshire in 2008. It is a family business run by its founder, William Chase Proceeds from the sale of Tyrrells were then used to establish the Chase Distillery, which produced its first batch of vodka in June 2008. In its first year, Chase Distillery sales reached ¬£140,000,Arnott, Sarah, \\"From posh crisps to best potato vodka\\", The Independent, 6 January 2011 and continued growth enabled the company to create a worldwide export market that included 36 countries between 2010 and 2016. As of February 2016, the Chase Distillery was selling 10,000 bottles of spirits per week. Product description Chase Vodka is a premium potato-based vodka made from specialty potato varieties such as Lady Claire and King Edward. It is a single-estate vodka, meaning that the base ingredients used for the vodka are produced on site (including the apples used for Naked Chase Apple Vodka). The production process involves peeling, heating and mashing the potatoes before adding yeast for fermentation. Next the potatoes are transferred to a traditional copper pot still where steam is used to raise the temperature and encourage distillation. Vapours rise up through the 70 ft tall rectification column, resulting in a vodka that has effectively been distilled 119 times. Finally, distilled water from the onsite borehole ‚Äì which draws water from underneath the farm‚Äôs apple trees ‚Äì is used to dilute the vodka to 40% ABV.Davies, Alex, \\"A Day in the Life Of‚Ä¶\\" FOUR, 30 January 2014 Flavours Chase Original Vodka is described on the company website as \\"a beautifully smooth vodka with a naturally sweet and creamy taste\\".http://chasedistillery.co.uk/vodka/.

Bioelectrogenesis is the generation of electricity by living organisms, a phenomenon that belongs to the science of electrophysiology. In biological cells, electrochemically active transmembrane ion channel and transporter proteins, such as the sodium-potassium pump, make electricity generation possible by maintaining a voltage imbalance from an electrical potential difference between the intracellular and extracellular space. The sodium-potassium pump simultaneously releases three Na ions away from, and influxes two K ions towards, the intracellular space. This generates an electrical potential gradient from the uneven charge separation created. The process consumes metabolic energy in the form of ATP.Baptista, V. \\"Starting Physiology: Bioelectrogenesis.\\" Advances in Physiology Education, vol. 39, no. 4, 2015, pp. 397-404. Bioelectrogenesis in fish  The term usually refers to the electricity-generating ability in some aquatic creatures, such as the electric eel, electric catfish, two genera of stargazers, electric rays and, to a lesser extent, the black ghost knifefish. Fish exhibiting such bioelectrogenesis often also possess electroreceptive abilities (which are more widespread) as part of an integrated electric system. Electrogenesis may be utilized for electrolocation, self-defense, electrocommunication and sometimes the stunning of prey. Bioelectrogenesis in microbial life The first examples of bioelectrogenic microbial life was identified in brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by M. C. Potter in 1911, using an early iteration of a microbial fuel cell (MFC). It was founded that chemical action in the breakdown of carbon such as fermentation and carbon decomposition in yeast is linked to the production of electricity.Potter, M. C. (1911). Electrical effects accompanying the decomposition of organic compounds. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Containing Papers of a Biological Character, 84(571), 260-276. Decomposition of organic or inorganic carbon by bacteria is paired with the release of electrons extracellularly towards electrodes, which generate electric currents. The microbe's released electrons are transferred by biocatalytic enzymes or redox-active compounds from the cell to the anode in the presence of a viable carbon source. This creates an electrical current as electrons move from anode to a physically separated cathode.Raghavulu, SV, et al. \\"Relative Effect of Bioaugmentation with Electrochemically Active and Non-Active Bacteria on Bioelectrogenesis in Microbial Fuel Cell.\\" Bioresource Technology, vol. 146, 2013, pp. 696-703.Velvizhi, G., and S. Venkata Mohan. \\"Electrogenic Activity and Electron Losses Under Increasing Organic Load of Recalcitrant Pharmaceutical Wastewater.\\" International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, vol. 37, no. 7, 2012, pp. 5969-5978. There are several mechanisms for extracellular electron transport. Some bacteria use nanowires in biofilm to transfer electrons towards the anode. The nanowires are made of pili that act as a conduit for the electrons to pass towards the anode.Gorby, Yuri A., et al. \\"Electrically Conductive Bacterial Nanowires Produced by Shewanella Oneidensis Strain MR-1 and Other Microorganisms.\\" Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, vol. 103, no. 30, 2006, pp. 11358-11363. Electron shuttles in the form of redox-active compounds like flavin, which is a cofactor, are also able to transport electrons. These cofactors are secreted by the microbe and reduced by redox participating enzymes such as Cytochrome C embedded on the microbe's cell surface. The reduced cofactors then transfer electrons to the anode and are oxidized.Kotloski, NJ, and JA Gralnick. \\"Flavin Electron Shuttles Dominate Extracellular Electron Transfer by Shewanella Oneidensis.\\" Mbio, vol. 4, no. 1, 2013, pp. e00553-12-e00553-12. Kumar, Ravinder, et al. \\"Exoelectrogens in Microbial Fuel Cells Toward Bioelectricity Generation: A Review.\\" International Journal of Energy Research, vol. 39, no. 8, 2015, pp. 1048-1067. In some cases, electron transfer is mediated by the cellular membrane embedded redox participating enzyme itself. Cytochrome C on the microbe's cell surface directly interacts with the anode to transfer electrons.Bond, Daniel R., and Derek R. Lovley. \\"Electricity Production by Geobacter Sulfurreducens Attached to Electrodes.\\" Applied and Environmental Microbiology, vol. 69, no. 3, 2003, pp. 1548-1555. Electron hopping from one bacteria to another in biofilm towards an anode through their outer membrane cytochromes is also another electron transport mechanism.Bonanni, PS, D. Massazza, and JP Busalmen. \\"Stepping Stones in the Electron Transport from Cells to Electrodes in Geobacter Sulfurreducens Biofilms.\\" Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, vol. 15, no. 25, 2013, pp. 10300-10306. These bacteria that transfer electrons in the microbe's exterior environment are called exoelectrogens. Electrogenic bacteria are present in all ecosystems and environments. This includes environments under extreme conditions such as hydrothermal vents and highly acidic ecosystems, as well as common natural environments such as soil and lakes. These electrogenic microbes are observed through the identification of microbes that reside in electrochemically active biofilms formed on MFC electrodes such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa.Chabert, N., Amin Ali, O., & Achouak, W.

The spelling of this title is now commonly modernized and abbreviated to The Obedience of a Christian Man. It was first published by Merten de Keyser in Antwerp, and is best known for advocating that the king of a country was the head of that country's church, rather than the pope, and to be the first instance, in the English language at any rate, of advocating the divine right of kings, a concept mistakenly attributed to the Catholic Church.Gerard Wegemer, Thomas More: Portrait of Courage (Scepter, 1998), 131. It is believed that the book greatly influenced Henry VIII's decision in declaring the Act of Supremacy, by which he became Supreme Head of the Church of England, in 1534.J.J. Scarisbrick, Henry VIII (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1968) Tyndale's opposition to Henry's divorce from Catherine of Aragon earned him the king's enmity, but when Tyndale was arrested by the Roman Catholic authorities in Antwerp in 1535, Henry's chief minister Thomas Cromwell attempted unsuccessfully to intervene on his behalf. Tyndale was executed for heresy the following year.  The Text  NOTE: All quotations are taken from The Obedience of a Christian Man, Penguin Books, ¬©2000. The Obedience of a Christian Man (from here on abbreviated as Obedience) was first printed in Antwerp on October 2, 1528 (viii). Despite being officially banned, Obedience was still widely read throughout England and, later on, was even mentioned in the works of Shakespeare (xxvii). Anne Boleyn, (later Henry VIII's second wife) owned a copy. As Henry was trying to obtain permission from the Pope to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, Anne asked Henry to read Obedience. Afterward, Henry exclaimed, ‚ÄúThis is a book for me and all kings to read‚Äù (xxiv). Obedience is divided into five overall sections. The first two are preliminary introductions: the first introduces Tyndale‚Äôs central concept of experiencing God through the reading of scripture; the second discusses the church‚Äôs disobedience (of God) in teaching ecclesiastical law rather than scripture. The book proper contains three overall topics: God‚Äôs laws of obedience, how one should obey and rule in life (addressed to all of English society), and a discussion on the literal interpretation of scripture. Throughout the text, Tyndale also discusses the intrusion into daily life, on both local and national levels by the church and, especially, the Pope, and how the church actively distorts scripture to fulfill its own needs. The tone of Obedience is low-key, despite containing radical ideology. For the first time, the concept of the supreme authority of the Bible in church is combined with the supreme authority of the king in state (the latter is what inspired Henry VIII). Although Tyndale complains about the lack of scripture in English life, his text features prose inspired by scripture and is abundant with direct quotes and references from the New Testament. He documents the origin of the direct quotes, but not his references, many of which would not have been recognized by the average person who read an original edition of Obedience, then or now. = Advocacy of an English-language Bible = ‚ÄúHow can we whet God‚Äôs Word (that is put into practice, use and exercise) upon our children and household, when we are violently kept from it and know it not?‚Äù (16). Tyndale accuses the church of keeping the people away from, and claiming all authority over, scripture. He believes that the reading of scripture directly reveals the power of God to the individual, without any need of an intermediary, like a priest. One of his principal concerns revisited throughout the text is the availability of an English-language Bible for the common people to read. Latin was, at the time, the official language of the church: All services and ceremonies were conducted in Latin, and as a result, the Bible too was only available in Latin. In fact, the church discouraged people from reading the Bible at all. Tyndale criticizes the church for allowing the English people to be ignorant of the Bible, and replacing the teaching of scripture with ceremonies or ritual superstition. ‚ÄúOn the holy days which were ordained to preach God‚Äôs word, set up long ceremonies, long matins, long masses and long evensongs, and all in Latin that they understand not, and roll them in darkness, that ye may lead them whither ye will‚Äù (90). According to Tyndale, church authorities adduce that a man must have a pure and quiet mind to read and fully comprehend scripture, and that the average man is too encumbered with worldly matters to do so. Tyndale counters this argument stating no one is as occupied with worldly matters as the church. Authorities also postulate that if every man were able to read scripture, every man would interpret it for himself, leading to widespread non-conformity and insurrection. Tyndale considers this claim to be ridiculous. As an example in the text, Tyndale defends Martin Luther against the published criticisms of Thomas More, who accused Luther of being the impetus of the German Peasants' War (1524‚Äì1525). Tyndale asks if the church is so concerned about Biblical misinterpretation, why does it not teach scripture? Would teaching scripture be more effective if every man possessed a copy of the Bible from which he could study? Tyndale asserts the true reason the church does not provide scripture in English is that the people might determine how the church manipulates scripture to its own benefit: that, in fact, the church does not practice what it preaches. Tyndale goes as far as to claim the church is as interested in scripture as ‚Äúthe Turks‚Äù (17). He states that Jesus had commanded the people to read scripture for themselves so they would know if ‚Äúfalse prophets‚Äù (22) were trying to deceive them and reminds us that the apostles preached in local languages, and therefore, as a matter of custom, the English people should receive scripture in English. Tyndale asks if (Saint) Jerome could translate scripture into his own language, why not the English people? Tyndale says the church authorities feel that English is ‚Äúrude‚Äù (19), i.e., undeveloped. He responds by asking if indeed did not God ‚Äúmake the English tongue?‚Äù (24), and reminds us that an earlier English monarch, King Athelstan, had scripture translated into Old English. He also states that God Himself provided His law to the Israelites in Hebrew. Tyndale quotes Paul from scripture, ‚ÄúAnd yet Paul [‚Ä¶] forbiddeth to speak in the church or congregation save in the tongue that all understand‚Äù (90). = English Society Realigned to Coincide with Biblical Law = ‚ÄúWho slew the prophets? Who slew Christ? Who slew his Apostles? Who the martyrs and all the righteous that ever were slain? The kings and the temporal sword at the request of the false prophets‚Äù (98). As indicated by its title, the central theme of Obedience is obedience, as designated by scripture onto all levels of English society. The first three sections discuss obedience as it applies to the family: Tyndale says that wives must be subordinate to their husbands, always, and that a ‚Äúgrudge against husband is a grudge against God‚Äù (34), and husbands are to help their wives overcome their ‚Äúinfirmities‚Äù (61). Servants must be obedient to their masters, not as sycophants, but as servants of Christ, as they are doing the will of God, and in return, their masters must be nurturing, ‚Äúthat they [servants] may see in Christ a cause why they ought lovingly to obey‚Äù (61). More significantly, in the section titled, ‚ÄúThe Obedience of Subjects unto Kings, Princes and Rulers,‚Äù Tyndale states that the ‚Äúpowers that be‚Äù (36) are powers ordained by God, and that resistance to earthly authority is resistance to God‚Äôs authority, but the bishops have usurped earthly authority from secular rulers, and therefore, they must be resisted, as God has appointed the kings, princes, and other secular leaders as his representatives on earth. He reiterates that whoever resists the king resists God, whether they are layman or clergy: ‚ÄúThe higher powers are the temporal king and princes unto whom God hath given the sword to punish whosoever sinneth‚Äù (40‚Äì41). In ‚ÄúThe Duty of Kings and of the Judges and Officers,‚Äù Tyndale says that the people, the subjects of the English kingdom, belong to God, and not the king. All men, including the king, must perform their earthly duties or answer to God; but the king is controlled by the Pope, creating a situation for like that of living in two nations, not one; that split between church and state has allowed the church to intervene at every level of English society. Tyndale reminds us that the Pope claims to be authorized by the New Testament; a claim first challenged by, as Tyndale credits, Martin Luther. Within Tyndale‚Äôs political theories are the conceptual emergence of the modern state and nationalism. He says the state should not be divided into the monarchy and the church, with each fighting for supremacy, although he is not what is termed an ‚ÄúErastian‚Äù (but neither was Erasmus himself): someone who believes that the church should be subordinate to the state. But Tyndale does not call for sedition. In Tyndale‚Äôs political system, the king is supreme in the state: ‚ÄúTo preach God‚Äôs Word is too much for half a man. And to minister a temporal kingdom is too much for half a man also. Either other requireth an [sic] whole man‚Äù (68). The king is to enforce the law as it is written in scripture. The king is not more important than the church: he is its facilitator and supreme authority. The king is to ensure that ministers are preaching properly and to maintain the integrity of the church. Tyndale states that it is the king‚Äôs responsibility to serve others, and not for others to serve him, but the bishops have corrupted kings into considering otherwise. The king is required to swear his allegiance to the bishops and the Pope, which causes Tyndale to ask, ‚ÄúHow hath the Pope the such temporal authority over king and emperor?‚Äù (124). ‚ÄúLet the temporal power to whom God hath given the sword to take vengeance, look or ever that they leap, and see what they do. Let the causes be disputed before them, and let him that is accused have room to answer for himself‚Äù (106). Tyndale restates the king‚Äôs authority over the kingdom, that the king ‚Äúis ordained to take vengeance and hath a sword in his hand and not peacock‚Äôs feathers. Fear him therefore and look on him as thou wouldest look on a sharp sword that hanged over thy head by an [sic] hair‚Äù (54‚Äì55). If the king is an evil king, he is evil because God has deemed it so. ‚ÄúAnd whatsoever is done unto us by them, that doeth God, be it good or bad‚Äù (55). Resisting an evil king is as evil as a child resisting his parents. If the people overthrow their king, a new, non-ordained king will replace him. Tyndale then asks what to do with the Pope‚Äôs false authority. He accuses the Pope (then Clement VII) of inverting God‚Äôs law: making what is a sin not, and that which is not a sin, sin. The Pope has unrightfully taken the authority to damn people to purgatory. ‚ÄúHow hath he authority above God‚Äôs laws and to command the angels, the saints and God himself?‚Äù (124). Tyndale asks the church, ‚ÄúWho gave the Pope the authority to command God to damn people?‚Äù Tyndale states that God commanded the clergy to bless the people, and the church asks God to damn them. ‚ÄúPaul also in many things which God had made free, gave pure and faithful counsel without tangling of any man‚Äôs conscience and without all manner commanding under pain of cursing, pain of excommunication, pain of heresy, pain of burning, pain of deadly sin, pain of hell and pain of damnation‚Äù (77). = Criticisms of the Church = ‚ÄúMake themselves holier than the lay people and take so great lands and goods‚Äù (112). In his third argument, Tyndale lists the abuses of the common people by the church. Tyndale accuses the church of being more concerned with performing ceremonies than living by the laws set by Christ in scripture. In terms of sacraments, like other Protestant reformers, Tyndale believes that baptism and the Eucharist are the only true sacraments, as both were performed by Christ in the New Testament (227). Tyndale feels that the church should preach rather than perform superstitious ceremonies, like confession: ‚ÄúMoreover if any man have sinned yet if he repent and believe the promise, we are sure by God‚Äôs word that he is loosed and forgiven in Christ‚Äù (124). In other words, acknowledge your sins to God. Priests should only preach and provide counseling, as they are not a mediator between the people and God. The clergy are only representatives of Christ, not Christ Himself. Tyndale, like Luther, believes that every Christian has a direct relationship with God; that a Christian‚Äôs own salvation is within him. Only prayer can bring true faith. ‚ÄúPaul in every epistle warneth us that we put no trust in works, and to beware of persuasions or arguments of man‚Äôs wisdom, of superstitiousness, of ceremonies of popeholiness and of all manner disguising. And exhorteth us to cleave fast onto the naked and pure word of God‚Äù (131). Tyndale also condemns the church for creating and enforcing ecclesiastical law rather than teaching God‚Äôs law, as it is written in scripture. As a result of ecclesiastical law, the church separates itself from the people it is supposed to serve. According to Tyndale, the New Testament, not church doctrine, contains all the laws by which a good Christian should abide. ‚Äú[O]ne king, one law, is God‚Äôs ordinance in every realm‚Äù (96). Tyndale states that, ironically, the church forbids that which Jesus promoted and promotes that which Jesus forbade. Unfortunately, Tyndale does not provide any specific examples to support this claim (however obvious it may appear), and this lack of evidence weakens the potential strength of his argument, even if we consider the historical context in which this argument was originally made. ‚ÄúThey preach it were better for thee to eat flesh on Good Friday than to hate thy neighbor: but let any man eat flesh but on a Sunday or break any other tradition of theirs, and he shall be bound and not loosed, till he have paid the utmost farthing, other with shame most vile or death most cruel, but hate thy neighbor as much as thou wilt and thou shalt have no rebuke of them, yea rob him, murder him, and then come to them and welcome‚Äù (99). Tyndale denies the authority and infallibility of the Pope (and, indirectly, attacks the church hierarchy, too): according to Tyndale‚Äôs interpretation of scripture, the foundation of the church is the apostle Peter‚Äôs faith, not himself. Peter‚Äôs successor has no authority other than to preach the gospel: ‚ÄúOur hypocrites boast themselves of the authority of Peter and of Paul and the other Apostles, clean contrary unto the deeds and doctrine of Peter, Paul and of all the other Apostles‚Äù (104). As Christians, Tyndale says, all are equal in the eyes of God, including the clergy. The clergy may have a special calling as preachers, but they are not superior to any other Christian: ‚ÄúSo it was in the manner to call Peter chief of the Apostles for his singular activity and boldness, and not that he should be lord over his brethren contrary to his own doctrine‚Äù (76).

The hill consisted of three jumps, with K-points of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. Constructed upon the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, it was built for the 1960 Winter Olympics; the 80-meter hill hosted the ski jumping event and the 60-meter hill the Nordic combined event. The jump was designed by Heini Klopfer and opened in 1958. After the Olympics the venue saw little use; it was renovated for the 1976 US National Ski Jumping Championships, but has since fallen into disrepair and demolished to make room for a ski lift. History As Squaw Valley was an undeveloped area when it was awarded the Olympics, the organizing committee was free to design a tailor-made Olympic resort.Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 33 Heini Klopfer from Oberstdorf, West Germany, was hired to design the ski jumping hills, which he finished in early 1957. He chose to locate it on the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, opposite Blyth Arena. He described the location as \\"the type of hill one always seeks but seldom finds\\".Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 103 The construction contract was awarded to Diversified Builders, who constructed the jumps during the summer and fall of 1958. Papoose Peak Jumps was the first Olympic ski jump to have three in-runs. Minor details were corrected in 1959 and 1960. It was renovated ahead of the 1976 US National Championships. However, it fell out of use afterwards and instead the hill was converted to a speed skiing and snowboarding hill. Later the resort's Far East Express chairlift was installed on the hill. Facilities The hill consisted of three jumps with a common out-run, each with a construction point (K-point) of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. It was located in the central area of the Olympic resort, next to the skating rinks and the Olympic Village. Tall trees on both sides of the hill gave good protection against the wind. The location was also ideal because of the sun was at the competitor's backs. A judges' tower was constructed on the side, which was both accessible by stairs from the bottom of the hill or from the chairlift which ran to the top of the in-runs. The hill had an overall height of , the in-run had a length of . The largest jump had a take-off angle of 8.5 degrees and a landing angle of 38 degrees. Events The first competitive use of the hills was the trial Olympics in February 1959. During the 1960 Winter Olympics, the 80-meter hill was used for special jumping on 28 February,Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 105 while the 60-meter hill was used for Nordic combined on 22 February.Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 106 The special ski jumping event was won by Helmut Recknagel of Germany, who also set a hill record of . He was followed up by Finland's Niilo Halonen and Austria's Otto Leodolter. In the ski jumping part of the Nordic combined event, Germany's Georg Thoma received the highest points ahead of the Soviet Union's Dmitriy Kochkin and Norway's Tormod Knutsen. The cross-country part of the event took place at McKinney Creek Stadium.Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 110 While Thoma won the discipline overall, Knutsen finished second overall ahead of the Soviet Union's Nikolai Gusakov. In 1976, the US National Championships in Ski Jumping were held at the large hill, and was won by Jim Denney.

The Revolutionary Wars First established as the 8th Hussar Regiment on 23 November 1792, it entered the French Revolutionary Army as the hussards de Lamothe. The unit was promoted to 7th Hussar Regiment on 4 June 1793 following the defection of the 4th Hussar Regiment to the counter revolutionary Arm√©e des √âmigr√©s. The Napoleonic Wars Colonel Marbot, commander of the 7e r√©giment de hussards During the first reign of Napoleon the regiment would earn much fame and recognition. It was part of General Antoine Lasalle‚Äôs Hellish Brigade alongside the 5th Hussar Regiment, earning much respect for bravery and performance in battle, eventually winning over 5 battle honors, but their rise to prominence was slowed when Antoine was killed at Wagram in 1809. In 1814 it was renamed the r√©giment de hussards d'Orl√©ans and on the Bourbon Restoration it took the name Colonel-g√©n√©ral des hussards, briefly reverting to 7th Hussar Regiment during the Hundred Days before being disbanded in November 1815. The 7th Hussars had several notable commanders including √âdouard de Colbert-Chabanais, Marcellin Marbot (during the Hundred Days) and Hercule Corbineau. Future cavalry generals Louis Bro (1781‚Äì1844) and Antoine Fortun√© Brack (1807‚Äì1813) also served with the regiment. The 19th Century In 1840 the cavalry unit was re-formed as the 7th Hussar Regiment out of elements of the 4th, 5th, 6th and 12th Mounted Chasseur Regiments and of the 5th Hussar Regiment.

Fluor-liddicoatite is indistinguishable from elbaite by X-ray diffraction techniques. It forms a series with elbaite and probably also with olenite. Liddiocoatite is currently a non-approved mineral name, but Aurisicchio et al. (1999) and Breaks et al. (2008) found OH-dominant species. Formulae are * Fluor-liddicoatite Ca(Li2Al)Al6(BO3)3Si6O18(OH)3F * Elbaite Na(Al1.5Li1.5)Al6(BO3)3Si6O18(OH)4 * Olenite NaAl9B3Si6O27O3(OH) Fluor- liddicoatite was named in 1977 after Richard T. Liddicoat (1918‚Äì2002) gemmologist and president of the Gemological Institute of America, who is well known for introducing the GIA diamond grading system in 1953.  Unit cell  Fluor-liddicoatite belongs to the trigonal crystal system, class 3 m, space group R 3m. It has a rhombohedral lattice, with unit cell parameters * a = 15.867 √Ö to 15.875 √Ö * c = 7.135 √Ö to 7.126 √Ö * Z = 3 (there are 3 formular units per unit cell).  Structure  Fluor-liddicoatite is isostructural with (has the same structure as) all members of the tourmaline group, which are cyclosilicates with the general formula * XY3Z6(BO3)3Si6O18(OH,O)3(OH,F). For fluor-liddicoatite, the X sites are occupied by Ca, the Y sites by Li or Al and the Z sites by Al, giving the formula * Ca(Li2Al)Al6(BO3)3Si6O18(OH)3F. The Y sites are octahedrally coordinated by oxygen O and hydroxyl OH ions; three octahedra surround the three-fold axis at the origin, and each octahedron shares an edge with each of its two nearest neighbours. The silicon Si ions are tetrahedrally coordinated by O, forming SiO4 groups. These tetrahedra form six-membered rings, with two of the four Os in each tetrahedron shared between adjacent tetrahedra. So the formula for the ring is Si6O18. In each Si tetrahedron an O at one free apex is shared with one of the Y octahedra. The boron B ions occur in triangular coordination, each triangle sharing a common apex with two Y octahedra. This composite unit is linked to others like it by aluminum Al ions at the Z sites, and its outer oxygen atoms are also atoms of the aluminum coordination octahedra. The X sites are sandwiched between the units along the c axis.Deer, Howie and Zussman (1986) Rock-forming minerals, (2nd edition), Volume 1B, Disilicates and Ring SilicatesAmerican Mineralogist (1948) 33:532  Crystal habit  Crystals are stout prismatic, with a curved convex trigonal outline, generally elongated and striated parallel to the c axis. Crystals are hemimorphic, meaning that the two ends of the crystal have different forms. Fluor-liddicoatite usually has a pedion (a single crystal face) opposite one or two pyramids.  Physical properties  A polished slice of liddicoatite from Madagascar. Photo Rob Lavinsky The color is usually smoky brown, but also pink, red, green, blue, or rarely white. Color zoning is abundant at the type locality, parallel to pyramid faces. This is due to changes in the solution during crystal growth. As the concentration of trace elements that serve as coloring agents changes, there will be areas of less or more color in different parts of the crystal. When the crystal is sliced perpendicular to the c axis, triangular zoning may be seen, together with a trigonal star that radiates from the centre of the crystal, with the three rays directed towards the corners of the triangular color patterns.extraLapis English No 3: Tourmaline (2002) The pink-red color is due to the manganese Mn3+ content, and the green color is due to intervalence charge transfer transactions between iron Fe2+ and titanium Ti4+. The streak is white to very light brown, lighter than the mass color, luster is vitreous and crystals are transparent to translucent. Cleavage is poor perpendicular to the c crystal axis, or it may be totally absent. The mineral is brittle, with an uneven to conchoidal fracture. It is very hard, with hardness , a little harder than zircon, making it suitable for use as a gemstone. Specific gravity is 3.02, a little lighter than fluorite. It is neither fluorescent nor radioactive.  Optical properties  Fluor- liddicoatite is uniaxial (-), with refractive Indices No = 1.637 and Ne = 1.621 for the type specimen. The refractive indices, however, will vary from specimen to specimen, as they depend on the content of iron and manganese, which are usually present as trace elements. Pleochroism is strong: O dark brown or pink, E light brown or pale pink.  Environment  Fluor- liddicoatite is detrital in soil at the type locality, presumably derived from the weathering of granitic pegmatites. Associated minerals are quartz, elbaite, albite and micas.  Localities  A spectacular radiating spray of liddicoatite crystals, from the Minh Tien Mine, Luc Yen, Vietnam. Size: 8.5 x 7.6 x 4.7 cm. The type locality is Anjanabonoina, Tsilaizina, Antsirabe, Madagascar.

Built in 1959, it was used for cross-country skiing, Nordic combined and biathlon at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley. History As Squaw Valley was an undeveloped area at the time of being awarded the Olympics, the organizing committee was free to build a tailor-made Olympic resort.Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 33 The organizing committee originally intended to house all events in Squaw Valley proper, but real estate developments in Squaw Valley made this difficult. In 1958 the organizing committee therefore decided to move all cross-country and biathlon events to McKinney Creek.Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 115 Rolf Gerlofsen had surveyed the area in March 1957, and work on the biathlon tracks and facilities was undertaken and completed during the summer of 1958. It was the first time that pull targets were installed for a biathlon competition.Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 118 Work on the stadium began in August 1959.Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 109 Plans for the tracks were approved by the International Ski Federation's Knut Korsvold and Sigge Bergman, after which construction of the trails could start in the summer 1959. Trial events were undertaken in 1959, in which it was found that mechanical track preparation was more efficient than manual, given that there was at least 45 centimeters (18 in) of snow. After the Olympics, the stadium was dismounted. Facilities McKinney Creek Stadium was located immediately off California State Route 89, 19 kilometers (12 mi) south of Squaw Valley. It was the only venue to not be located in the ski resort itself. The stadium was long and between wide. Bleachers were erected on one side of the finish line with space for 1,000 spectators and 200 press officers. A 16 by 4 meter (54 by 13 ft) scoreboard was built behind the finish line, which at any given time showed the latest times and the ten best results. Flags for all participating nations at the games were hoisted along the stadium. The main building was the Timing Building, which consisted of a calculations room, a communications room, an office for the race secretary in addition to areas for timing staff and equipment. The upper section was used by the public announcer and featured sixteen radio booths. Two 6 by 15 meter (20 by 48 ft) Quonset huts with a total sixteen rooms were built for competitors for waxing, resting and changing. Lack of water caused the stadium to lack showers. An identically sized Quonset hut was built for administration personnel and course preparation works. A larger 6 by 20 meter (20 by 64 ft) Quonset hut was built for the press, which included typewriters, teletype machines, telephones and a darkroom. The biathlon course had four shooting ranges along the course. A range was installed at , a range at , a range at and a range at . The ranges had 15 pull-type targets with a \\"sleeve and plunger\\" system with five recharges. This allowed up to 75 participants in the race. An additional practice range was built in the Squaw Valley‚ÄìDeer Park area, in addition to the range being available for training. Coordination of the shooting station was undertaken by four groups of twenty men from the United States Air Force Rifle School. First aid stations were installed at each range. Track preparation was undertaken every evening before the events. Crews were assigned to sections of tracks, with the responsibility of skiing the courses one and a half hours before start, policing the section and removing markers after the event.

He was the first professor of Russian in Britain, and his house in North Oxford was marked with a commemorative blue plaque by the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board in 2009.William Richard Morfill (1834‚Äì1909), Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Scheme, UK. Life William Richard Morfill, the second child and first son of a professional musician called William Morfill from Maidstone, Kent, was born on 17 November 1834. After studying at Maidstone Grammar School and Tonbridge School, he matriculated at the University of Oxford as a member of Corpus Christi College, on 28 May 1853. He moved to Oriel College with a scholarship in classics later in 1853. He obtained his BA degree in 1857, although this was only a pass degree as he had fallen seriously ill during the examinations. He remained in Oxford after graduation, giving private tuition. His Oxford MA was awarded in 1860, the same year in which he married Charlotte Lee and in which his first published translations from Russian appeared. Between 1865 and 1869, he lectured in philosophy and modern history at one of the private halls attached to the university, Charsley's Hall. Morfill had had an interest in foreign languages since school days, encouraged by a Tonbridge teacher who gave him a Russian grammar. He first visited Russia in 1870 and Prague in 1871, learning languages as he travelled; a visit to Georgia in 1888 led to an article on Georgian literature. His interest in Slavonic languages was rewarded with his appointment in 1870 by Oxford to provide the first lectures of the Ilchester Foundation, endowed to encourage studies in this area. He gave further lectures in this series in 1873 and 1883, leading to his 1883 publication Dawn of European Literature: Slavonic Literature. By this stage, his wife had died (in 1881; there were no children) and he took comfort in his work. He was appointed Reader in Russian and the other Slavonic languages in 1889 and Professor in 1900. Russian was not a degree subject at Oxford until 1904: it has been said that Oxford's \\"approval of the languages he had cultivated while they lay outside the curriculum is Morfill's most enduring achievement.\\" He was the first professor of Russian in Britain. He also became Curator of the Taylor Institution and was appointed a Fellow of the British Academy in 1903. He was awarded an honorary doctorate by Charles University, Prague in 1908. His publications included Slavonic Literature (1883), A history of Russia from the birth of Peter the Great to the death of Alexander II (1902) and various books on grammar in Polish, Serbian, Bulgarian and Russian, as well as translations. He died on 9 November 1909 and was buried in the same grave as his wife. William Richard Morfill, commemorative plaque in Park Town, Oxford In 2009, the Oxfordshire Blue Plaques Board marked 42 Park Town, where Morfill lived from 1863 to 1899, with a plaque to commemorate him.

It was published independently in the early 1970s by Daniel Janzen and Joseph Connell.Connell, J.H. \\"On the role of natural enemies in preventing competitive exclusion in some marine animals and in rain forest trees.\\" In: Dynamics of Population. Ed. P.J. Den Boer and G.R. Gradwell. Wageningen: Pudoc, 1970. According to their hypothesis, host-specific herbivores, pathogens, or other natural enemies (often referred to as predators) make the areas near a parent tree (the seed producing tree) inhospitable for the survival of seedlings. These natural enemies are referred to as 'distance- responsive predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings near the parent tree, or 'density-dependent predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings where they are most abundant (which is typically near the parent tree). Such predators can prevent any one species from dominating the landscape, because if that species is too common, there will be few safe places for its seedlings to survive. However, because the predators are host-specific (also called specialists), they will not harm other tree species. As a result, if a species becomes very rare, then more predator-free areas will become available, giving that species' seedlings a competitive advantage. This negative feedback allows the tree species to coexist, and can be classified as a stabilizing mechanism. The Janzen-Connell hypothesis has been called a special case of keystone predation, predator partitioning or the pest pressure hypothesis.Carson, Walter A. and Stefan A. Schnitzer. Tropical Forest Community Ecology. Blackwell Publishing: Hoboken, NJ, 2008. The pest pressure hypothesis states that plant diversity is maintained by specialist natural enemies. The Janzen- Connell hypothesis expands on this, by claiming that the natural enemies are not only specialists, but also are distance-responsive or density-responsive. This mechanism has been proposed as promoting diversity of forests as it promotes survival of a number of different plant species within one localized region. While previously thought to explain the high diversity of tropical forests in particular, subsequent research has demonstrated the applicability of the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis in temperate settings as well. The Black Cherry is one such example of a temperate forest species whose growth patterns can still be explained by the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis. History =Daniel Janzen‚Äôs hypothesis= Daniel Janzen published his hypothesis in 1970 in The American Naturalist under the article \\"Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests.\\" His hypothesis was based on the observation that in tropical forests (when compared to temperate forests), there were few new adult trees in the immediate vicinity of their parent tree. He explained the low density of tropical trees and lack of \\"bunching\\" of tree types around parent trees for two reasons: (1) the number of seeds decline with distance from the parent tree and (2) that the adult tree, its seeds, and seedlings are a source of food for host-specific parasites and diseases. Using his observations, Janzen created a model demonstrating the probability of a seed maturation or a seedling survival as a function of distance from the parent tree (as well as total seed count, dispersal mechanism, and predatorial activity). =Joseph Connell hypothesis= Joseph Connell published his hypothesis in 1971 in Dynamics of Populations. Unlike Janzen, Connell proposed experiments that focused on the key prediction that exclusion of host-specific predators would cause a decrease in diversity as tree species with greater establishment or competitive ability formed low-diversity seedling and sapling communities where dominance was concentrated in a few species. He formed his hypothesis through observations in Queensland, Australia. Along with Jack Greening Tracey and Larry Johnson Webb, he mapped trees in two rainforests and observed that smaller seedlings tended to occur in single-species clumps. Smaller seedlings also exhibited greater mortality, especially when their nearest neighbor was an individual of the same species. This pattern lessened with growth and age until seedlings exhibited similar pattern diversity to adults. To reinforce these observations, Connell ran an experiment showing that adult trees have a deleterious effect on smaller trees of the same species. In another experiment, Connell found that pre-germination predation was greater on seeds near adults of the same species than those near adults of others. Through these observations, Connell suggests that each tree species has host-specific enemies that attack it and any of its offspring which are close to the parent. This emphasizes the importance of the role of predation in preventing trees from forming single-species groves, which is probably the only way in which one species of tree could exclude others by interspecies competition. Effects on forest dynamics =Disease dynamics and tree density= Plant pathogens follow infectious disease dynamics. The basic reproductive rate (R_0) of a disease is dependent on three variables such that: Where Œ≤ is the transmission rate or infectiousness of the disease, L is the average infection time of the host, and S is the density of the host population. By decreasing any one of the variables, the reproduction rate of the disease decreases. Since seed dispersal is such that the highest density of seeds is around the parent with density decreasing with distance from the parent, the reproduction rate of a disease infecting seeds and seedlings will be highest around the parent and decrease with distance. Thus, seedlings close to the parent are likely to die due to the disease prevalence. However, seedlings farther away are less likely to encounter the disease and therefore will more likely grow into adults. =Herbivory and tree density= Specialist herbivores who consume plant matter can also be thought of as having a \\"transmission rate\\" between individuals similarly to a disease. Tree predators (especially herbivorous insects) are limited by the ease of movement. When individuals are closer together at high density, movement between trees is easier and the predators quickly spread out. However, at low tree density, predators can not find the next individual with as much ease and thus often have low transmission rates leading to less specialist predation. Problematic aspects Many studies examining the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis have shown supporting patterns with a number of tree species, but despite this there are also problematic aspects of the hypothesis. # The first is that the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis explains diversity at a community-wide scale, but most studies have only looked at a single species or a localized region. Most studies do not test the diversity prediction and did not determine the causes for patterns consistent with Janzen‚ÄìConnell effects. As Wright (2002) pointed out, \\"field measurements only demonstrate that niche differences, Janzen‚ÄìConnell effects, and negative density dependence occur. Implications for species coexistence and plant diversity remain conjectural.\\" # While these host-specific predators may play keystone species roles as they possibly aid in the prevention of superior tree competitors from monopolizing an area, no study has yet to examine species richness and abundance after removing natural enemies, creating a gap in the supporting research for the hypothesis. # Diversity may be maintained, at least in part, by episodic outbreaks of specialized pests, which may reduce the survivorship, growth, and reproductive success of adults of a species whenever they are particularly aggregated. Thus, specialist predation also impacts adult density, rather than just juveniles which has been the focus of research efforts. # Disease and predation may be just affecting overall density rather than in localized regions around adults alone. # Theoretical work has suggested that distance- responsive predators are less able to promote coexistence than equivalent predators that are not distance-responsive. # Many empirical studies have shown that few natural enemies are host-specific specialists, as the original hypothesis claimed. However, theoretical work has suggested that predators can have broader diets as long as they are more damaging to their primary host than other species. # The responses of density-dependent predators' may not be restricted to a single trophic level, and when multiple trophic levels interact, Janzen-Connell effects may be negated. This is an example of \\"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\\" and it has been shown that the potential of host-specific insects to induce negative-density dependence in plant populations can be severely limited when the natural enemies of the seed predators are also density responsive . Research testing the hypothesis =Supporting research= There have been over 50 studies designed to test predictions of this hypothesis in tropical and other settings and most show that many tree species exhibit patterns consistent with Janzen‚ÄìConnell effects. Studies that have supported the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis: * A 2010 study of Panama forest reinforced that Janzen‚ÄìConnell effects are also prevalent in tropical rainforests as seedlings growing close to their parents are likely to die due to microorganisms in the soil. * A 2008 study by Petermann et al. in grasslands showed that soil-borne pests created a feedback very similar to the Janzen‚ÄìConnell effect, supporting the hypothesis as a driver of diversity in temperate ecosystems. This study suggests that the predator/density mechanism that promotes species diversity is not contained to tropical forests alone ‚Äì even if tropical ecosystems do have the highest diversity. This supports the hypothesis as a mechanism for diversity, but not as an explanation latitudinal gradients in species diversity. * An examination of spatial data for 24 woody tropical rain forest plants showed either density-dependence or distance-dependence in plant offspring, supporting the hypothesis. However, other causal factors such as allelopathy were also suggested in some cases. =Dissenting research= Studies questioning the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis: * Hyatt et al. examined the hypothesis across a number of tree species (rather than focusing on the effects on just one) and found no support for the distance-dependence of the hypothesis and concluded that the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis was not a mechanism for diversity. They did find however that in temperate settings, distance from parent reduced survivorship. But in tropical settings there was a slight positive correlation between the improved competitive ability of seeds and distance from parent. These findings were later challenged: Using additional data, and slightly different statistical techniques, Comita et al. showed that there was strong evidence for distance-dependence at the seedling stage, but not at the seed stage. * A 1994 study by Burkey found that seed predation did not follow a pattern supporting that of the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis along a meaningful scale. Seeds within 1 metre from the trunk were highly predated. However, seeds reached their peak density while still under the canopy of their parent. The authors concluded that seed predation did not follow the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis.Burkey, T.V. \\"Tree Species Diversity: A Test of the Janzen‚ÄìConnell Model.\\" Oecologia. 97. (1994): 533‚Äì540. Current conclusions and further research It is tricky to form conclusions regarding the accuracy of the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis as it is difficult to falsify. This is because: * Heavy predation may keep some species rare and widely spaced, and these species may also be the best competitors. If so, these species are most likely to form dense aggregations that would reduce diversity in local areas. But due to their rarity or a belief that rare species are not regulated by density- dependence, these species may be the ones least likely to be studied. * This means that the failure to find Janzen‚ÄìConnell effects for what could be hundreds of tree species does not reject the hypothesis, as ecologists are missing the few key species where it does apply. However, dissenting findings do reduce the importance of the hypothesis for explaining overall coexistence of a number species. ** For example, Hyatt et al. (2003) found that there were \\"individual cases of conformity to the hypothesis,\\" which is all that is needed for the hypothesis to work if the specific cases represent tree species that are excellent competitors, highly shade tolerant, habitat generalists, or some combination of these traits that would allow these species to otherwise dominate the ecosystem. It is likely that a number of mechanisms underscore the coexistence of similar species and thus cause biodiversity in ecosystems. It is possible the Janzen‚ÄìConnell hypothesis is applicable only for some species depending on species characteristics. The hypothesis may also be affected by the kind of predator or pathogen as preliminary research has shown that the hypothesis is true only when host-specific predators have limited mobility with a range less than the seed dispersal range.Nathan, Ran and Renato Casagrandi. \\"A simple mechanistic model of seed dispersal, predation and plant establishment: Janzen‚ÄìConnell and beyond.\\" Journal of Ecology. 92.

Until 1889 the district was in the county of Middlesex, but included in the area of the Metropolitan Board of Works. In 1889 the area of the MBW was constituted the County of London, and the district board became a local authority under the London County Council.

The young of the species are among the many fish that are sometimes called sardines. This common species is found in the northeast Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea at depths of . It reaches up to in length and mostly feeds on planktonic crustaceans. This schooling species is a batch spawner where each female lays 50,000‚Äì60,000 eggs. Description The European pilchard is a small to medium-sized, somewhat elongated, herring-like fish. The origin of the pelvic fins is well behind that of the dorsal fin, and the last two soft rays on the anal fin are larger than the remainder. The upper parts are green or olive, the flanks are golden and the belly is silvery. Distribution and habitat The European pilchard occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea. Its range extends from Iceland and the southern part of Norway and Sweden southwards to Senegal in West Africa. In the Mediterranean Sea it is common in the western half and the Adriatic Sea, but uncommon in the eastern half and the Black Sea. It is a migratory, schooling, largely coastal species but sometimes travels as far as out to sea. During the day it is mostly in the depth range but can go as deep as . At night it is generally from beneath the surface. Ecology Juveniles schooling by day in shallow water in the Ligurian Sea, Italy In the Mediterranean, the European pilchard moves offshore in the autumn, preferring the deeper cooler waters and constant salinity out at sea to the variable temperatures and salinities of inshore waters. Spawning starts to take place in winter, and in early spring, juveniles, larvae and some adults move towards the coast, while other adults migrate inshore later in the year. Multiple batches of eggs are produced over a long breeding period, total fecundity being 50,000 to 60,000. Most juveniles become sexually mature at about a year old and a length of ; pilchards are fully grown at about when aged about eight years. The diet consists of both zooplankton and phytoplankton. The zooplankton is largely copepods and their larvae, which make daily vertical migrations to feed near the surface at night, and this is when the adult pilchards feed on them; juveniles feed during the day as well. Along with the European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), the European pilchard plays an important intermediate role in the Mediterranean ecosystem as a consumer of plankton and as a food for larger demersal predators such as the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) and the European conger eel (Conger conger). This role is particularly noticeable in the Adriatic Sea where the water is shallow, the food chain is shorter and energy is retained within the basin; overfishing of pilchard and anchovy can thus cause dramatic changes in the ecosystem. Fisheries and uses European pilchards, center right, are the cheapest thing for sale at this fish stall in Syracuse, Sicily There are important fisheries for this species in most of its range. It is mainly caught with purse seines and lampara nets, but other methods are also used including bottom trawling with high opening nets. In total, around a million tonnes are taken annually, with Morocco and Spain having the largest catches. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) considers the Moroccan fishery overfished. The adults may be sold as pilchards; the juveniles, as sardines. The terms \\"sardine\\" and \\"pilchard‚Äù are not precise, and what is meant depends on the region. The United Kingdom's Sea Fish Industry Authority, for example, classifies sardines as young pilchards. One criterion suggests fish shorter in length than are sardines, and larger fish are pilchards. The FAO/WHO Codex standard for canned sardines cites 21 species that may be classed as sardines. The fish is sold fresh, frozen or canned, or is salted and smoked or dried; as the flesh is of low value, some of the catch is used for fishing bait, fertilizer and some is manufactured into fish meal.

The Devil's Jumps are linked to a body of folklore relating to the surrounding area. The highest of the three Jumps is Stony Jump. Middle Devil's Jump measures high and once supported an observatory built by 19th century British astronomer Richard Christopher Carrington.Churt Parish Council. The hills are outcrops of an ironstone variety of sandstone of the Folkestone Beds of Lower Greensand set among acidic heathland.Gahan 2006, p.10. The three hills are formed of an ironstone known locally as carstone, marginally distinct from Bargate stone, strongly cemented with iron making it resistant to erosion by the elements.Ashurt & Dimes 2004, p.62. Gahan 2006, p.10. The summit of the easternmost Jump Ironstone outcrop on the easternmost Jump The first mention of the Devil's Jumps appears to be on a map by John Rocque, dating to 1765.Smith 2005, p.60. William Cobbett mentioned the Devil's Jumps in his Rural Rides, first published in 1830.Cobbett 1830, 2001, p.116. Of the hills he says: Folklore The Devil's Jumps are linked to a variety of local landmarks by folklore, including Mother Ludlam's Cave near the ruins of Waverley Abbey, the Devil's Punch Bowl at Hindhead, the village of Thursley and the parish church at Frensham. The folklore includes various tales. One states that the Devil used to amuse himself by leaping from the top of each hill to the next. This annoyed the god Thor who picked up a boulder and threw it at the Devil, causing him to flee and leaving the boulder at the Devil's Jumps. This same story is told of the Devil's Jumps near Treyford on the South Downs in West Sussex, but it is likely to have originated at the Devil's Jumps in Surrey. The inclusion of the pagan god Thor in the tale is likely to have taken place in the early years of the 20th century, since local historian George Clinch mentioned the Jumps and the pagan derivation of the Thursley placename without linking either when he wrote in 1895. Two divergent, possibly linked, narratives were collected in the 19th century: #Mother Ludlam (who was a witch) had her cauldron stolen by the Devil, who made off with it, with the witch following behind on her broomstick.Alexander 1986, 2003, pp.29-30. Every time the Devil took a great leap he kicked up a hill, and these hills are the Devil's Jumps. He left the cauldron on Kettlebury Hill, from where it was recovered and put in Frensham church for safekeeping. When the Devil disappeared, he left the valley of the Devil's Punch Bowl. #A great boulder was on one of these hills, where a person needing any tool, even a yoke for oxen by prayer and touching the boulder would receive it, provided they promised to give it back. Later a cauldron was requested, kept in Frensham's church beyond its use and so the mystical loan facility came to an end. Relative prominence The Jumps protrude above sea level or above the col (nearest notch/gap). This places them 32nd among Surrey Hills and narrowly among the 34 Surrey Hills above above sea level with only 36 hills in the county listed by the national hill-climbing database.Database of British and Irish Hills Retrieved 2015-03-06 Notes References : : : : : : : : Category:Surrey folklore Category:Hills of Surrey ","title":"Devil's Jumps, Churt"},{"id":"28267549","text":"Machine diagnosis may refer to: *Machine fault diagnosis, diagnosis made on a machine *Clinical decision support system, diagnosis assisted by a machine ","title":"Machine diagnosis"},{"id":"28267550","title":"International Motor Insurance Card System"},{"id":"28267556","text":"Ibrahim Spahiƒá (born 10 May 1952 in Sarajevo) is the president and director of the X Biennial of Young Artist of Europe and the Mediterranean.

His Sunday strip was added on March 12, 1933, and the following year, the title was changed to Napoleon and Uncle Elby. McBride's assistant on the strip was former Disney artist Roger Armstrong (1917‚Äì2007). After McBride's 1951 death in Altadena, California, his second wife, Margot Fischer McBride, wrote the strip, and she hired Armstrong as the illustrator.

He is known for being a founding member, executive committee member and sponsor of the Rheingau Musik Festival, where he initiated a series of annual portraits of international composers of contemporary classical music.  Career  Fink was taught piano from the age of seven. In Frankfurt he took organ lessons with Helmut Walcha and learned conducting with Kurt Thomas. He joined the company of his father in 1930 and expanded it. He was Managing director of the Firmengruppe Fink (FINK Schuhe + Sport GmbH) in Wiesbaden until his retirement in 2002. He founded a church choir at the Christuskirche in Wiesbaden and served there for 25 years as organist. In 1987 he was one of the founding members of the Rheingau Musik Festival, together with Michael Herrmann, Tatiana von Metternich-Winneburg, Claus Wisser, Michael Bolenius, Hans-Clemens Lucht and Ulrich Rosin. The advertising department of his company designed the logo for the festival. Fink was on the board of the Rheingau Musik Festival F√∂rderverein, an association to support the festival, and was its president during the first years. He was a member the jury of the Rheingau Musik Preis, together with Rolf Beck (Artistic Director of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival), Leo-Karl Gerhartz (retired Music Programme Director of the state broadcaster Hessischer Rundfunk and Peter Hanser-Strecker (Board Chairperson of Schott Music). Fink received the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 2007. He was Grand Officier of the Confr√©rie de la Cha√Æne des R√¥tisseurs. On 19 October 2011 the Staatliche Hochschule f√ºr Gestaltung Karlsruhe granted him an honorary Doctorate of Philosophy.  Engagement for contemporary music  Fink's interest in contemporary music was instilled in 1947 by Hindemith's opera Mathis der Maler. He supported the Internationale Ferienkurse f√ºr Neue Musik in Darmstadt. He was interested in premieres and a personal friend of composers; Wolfgang Rihm served as his best man. Several composers dedicated music to him, such as Volker David Kirchner his piano quartet with clarinet Exil in 1995 and Toshio Hosokawa Temple Bells Voice from the last movement of his oratorio Voiceless Voice in Hiroshima in 2001. For the Rheingau Musik Festival he initiated in 1990 the annual Komponistenportr√§t, the presentation of a living composer and his or her work. Fink was the personal contact to the composers and a sponsor of the concert series, presenting the composers and their music: Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Mauricio Kagel, Volker David Kirchner, Wilhelm Killmayer, Wolfgang Rihm, Dieter Schnebel, Aribert Reimann, Helmut Lachenmann, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Hans Werner Henze, Krzysztof Penderecki, Steve Reich, Sofia Gubaidulina, Gy√∂rgy Kurt√°g, Arvo P√§rt, Henri Dutilleux, Heinz Holliger, Toshio Hosokawa, Rodion Shchedrin, Kaija Saariaho, Hans Zender and P√©ter E√∂tv√∂s. His 80th birthday was celebrated in a concert of the Rheingau Musik Festival at Schloss Johannisberg on 16 August 2010, with compositions of five composers including three premieres, works of Kirchner, Rihm, Hosokawa, Lachenmann and J√∂rg Widmann for clarinet, percussion, piano and saxophone.

The primitive objects of study are physical processes, and the different ways that these can be composed. It was pioneered in 2004 by Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke.  Mathematical setup  Mathematically, the basic setup is captured by a dagger symmetric monoidal category: composition of morphisms models sequential composition of processes, and the tensor product describes parallel composition of processes. The role of the dagger is to assign to each state a corresponding test. These can then be adorned with more structure to study various aspects. For instance: * A dagger compact category allows one to distinguish between an \\"input\\" and \\"output\\" of a process. In the diagrammatic calculus, it allows wires to be bent, allowing for a less restricted transfer of information. In particular, it allows entangled states and measurements, and gives elegant descriptions of protocols such as quantum teleportation.Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke, A categorical semantics of quantum protocols, Proceedings of the 19th IEEE conference on Logic in Computer Science (LiCS'04). IEEE Computer Science Press (2004). * Considering only the morphisms that are completely positive maps, one can also handle mixed states, allowing the study of quantum channels categorically.P. Selinger, Dagger compact closed categories and completely positive maps, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Quantum Programming Languages, Chicago, June 30‚ÄìJuly 1 (2005). * Wires are always two- ended (and can never be split into a Y), reflecting the no-cloning and no- deleting theorems of quantum mechanics. * Special commutative dagger Frobenius algebras model the fact that certain processes yield classical information, that can be cloned or deleted, thus capturing classical communication.B. Coecke and D. Pavlovic, Quantum measurements without sums. In: Mathematics of Quantum Computing and Technology, pages 567‚Äì604, Taylor and Francis (2007). * In early works, dagger biproducts were used to study both classical communication and the superposition principle. Later, these two features have been separated.B. Coecke and S. Perdrix, Environment and classical channels in categorical quantum mechanicsIn: Proceedings of the 19th EACSL Annual Conference on Computer Science Logic (CSL), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 6247, Springer-Verlag. * Complementary Frobenius algebras embody the principle of complementarity, which is used to great effect in quantum computation, as in the ZX-calculus.B.

Duncan, Interacting quantum observables In: Proceedings of the 35th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), pp. 298‚Äì310, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 5126, Springer. A substantial portion of the mathematical backbone to this approach is drawn from Australian category theory, most notably from work by Max Kelly and M. L. Laplaza,G.M. Kelly and M.L.

Modern textbooks include C. Heunen and J. Vicary, Categories for Quantum Theory, Oxford University Press (2019) and.B. Coecke and A. Kissinger, Picturing Quantum Processes, Cambridge University Press (2017)  Diagrammatic calculus  One of the most notable features of categorical quantum mechanics is that the compositional structure can be faithfully captured by a purely diagrammatic calculus.B. Coecke, Quantum picturalism, Contemporary Physics 51, 59‚Äì83 (2010). These diagrammatic languages can be traced back to Penrose graphical notation, developed in the early 1970s.R. Penrose, Applications of negative dimensional tensors, In: Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications, D.~Welsh (Ed), pages 221‚Äì244. Academic Press (1971). Diagrammatic reasoning has been used before in quantum information science in the quantum circuit model, however, in categorical quantum mechanics primitive gates like the CNOT-gate arise as composites of more basic algebras, resulting in a much more compact calculus. In particular, the ZX-calculus has sprung forth from categorical quantum mechanics as a diagrammatic counterpart to conventional linear algebraic reasoning about quantum gates. The ZX-calculus consists of a set of generators representing the common Pauli quantum gates and the Hadamard gate equipped with a set of graphical rewrite rules governing their interaction. Although a standard set of rewrite rules has not yet been established, some versions have been proven to be complete, meaning that any equation that holds between two quantum circuits represented as diagrams can be proven using the rewrite rules. The ZX-calculus has been used to study for instance measurement based quantum computing.  Branches of activity  = Axiomatization and new models = One of the main successes of the categorical quantum mechanics research program is that from seemingly weak abstract constraints on the compositional structure, it turned out to be possible to derive many quantum mechanical phenomena. In contrast to earlier axiomatic approaches, which aimed to reconstruct Hilbert space quantum theory from reasonable assumptions, this attitude of not aiming for a complete axiomatization may lead to new interesting models that describe quantum phenomena, which could be of use when crafting future theories.J. C. Baez, Quantum quandaries: a category-theoretic perspective. In: The Structural Foundations of Quantum Gravity, D. Rickles, S. French and J. T. Saatsi (Eds), pages 240‚Äì266. Oxford University Press (2004). = Completeness and representation results = There are several theorems relating the abstract setting of categorical quantum mechanics to traditional settings for quantum mechanics. * Completeness of the diagrammatic calculus: an equality of morphisms can be proved in the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces if and only if it can be proved in the graphical language of dagger compact closed categories.P. Selinger, Finite dimensional Hilbert spaces are complete for dagger compact closed categories. Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, to appear (2010). * Dagger commutative Frobenius algebras in the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces correspond to orthogonal bases.B. Coecke, D. Pavlovic, and J. Vicary, A new description of orthogonal bases. Mathematical Structures in Computer Science, to appear (2008). A version of this correspondence also holds in arbitrary dimension.S. Abramsky and C. Heunen H*-algebras and nonunital Frobenius algebras: first steps in infinite-dimensional categorical quantum mechanics, Clifford Lectures, AMS Proceedings of Symposia in Applied Mathematics, to appear (2010). * Certain extra axioms guarantee that the scalars embed into the field of complex numbers, namely the existence of finite dagger biproducts and dagger equalizers, well-pointedness, and a cardinality restriction on the scalars.J. Vicary, Completeness of dagger-categories and the complex numbers, Journal of Mathematical Physics, to appear (2008). * Certain extra axioms on top of the previous guarantee that a dagger symmetric monoidal category embeds into the category of Hilbert spaces, namely if every dagger monic is a dagger kernel. In that case the scalars form an involutive field instead of just embedding in one. If the category is compact, the embedding lands in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.C. Heunen, An embedding theorem for Hilbert categories. Theory and Applications of Categories 22, 321‚Äì344. (2008) * Special dagger commutative Frobenius algebras in the category of sets and relations correspond to discrete abelian groupoids.D. Pavlovic, Quantum and classical structures in nondeterminstic computation, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 5494, page 143‚Äì157, Springer (2009). * Finding complementary basis structures in the category of sets and relations corresponds to solving combinatorical problems involving Latin squares.J. Evans, R. Duncan, A. Lang and P. Panangaden, Classifying all mutually unbiased bases in Rel (2009). * Dagger commutative Frobenius algebras on qubits must be either special or antispecial, relating to the fact that maximally entangled tripartite states are SLOCC-equivalent to either the GHZ or the W state.B. Coecke and A. Kissinger The compositional structure of multipartite quantum entanglement, Proceedings of the 37th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), pages 297‚Äì308, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 6199, Springer (2010). = Categorical quantum mechanics as logic = Categorical quantum mechanics can also be seen as a type theoretic form of quantum logic that, in contrast to traditional quantum logic, supports formal deductive reasoning.R. Duncan (2006) Types for Quantum Computing, DPhil. thesis. University of Oxford. There exists software that supports and automates this reasoning. There is another connection between categorical quantum mechanics and quantum logic, as subobjects in dagger kernel categories and dagger complemented biproduct categories form orthomodular lattices.C. Heunen and B. Jacobs, Quantum logic in dagger kernel categories. Order 27, 177‚Äì212 (2009).J. Harding, A Link between quantum logic and categorical quantum mechanics, International Journal of Theoretical Physics 48, 769‚Äì802 (2009). In fact, the former setting allows logical quantifiers, the existence of which was never satisfactorily addressed in traditional quantum logic. = Categorical quantum mechanics as foundation for quantum mechanics = Categorical quantum mechanics allows a description of more general theories than quantum theory. This enables one to study which features single out quantum theory in contrast to other non-physical theories, hopefully providing some insight into the nature of quantum theory. For example, the framework allows a succinct compositional description of Spekkens' toy theory that allows one to pinpoint which structural ingredient causes it to be different from quantum theory.B. Coecke, B. Edwards and R. W. Spekkens, Phase groups and the origin of non- locality for qubits, Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science, to appear (2010).

Built in 1872 at the intersection of Auglaize and Blackhoof Streets, it has always been primarily an industrial building. It was declared a historic site in 2010. Wintzer corporation One of the area's first pioneers, Charles Wintzer, founded a tannery in 1848. Concentrating on the manufacture of leather products,Auglaize County Historical Society. A History of Auglaize County Ohio. Defiance: Hubbard, 1979, 108. the Charles Wintzer Tanning Company expanded through the purchase of a similar local company in 1862, and it was incorporated in 1898. By 1905, its annual output was 2,500 sides of leather;Williamson, C.W. History of Western Ohio and Auglaize County. Columbus: Linn and Sons, 1905, 615. however, in that year, the company made a fundamental change in its business model. Instead of operating as a tannery, the firm moved to retailing hides to other tanneries and buying and selling various byproducts of animal processing. Nevertheless, it remained in the Wintzer family; it was re-incorporated as G.A. Wintzer & Son in 1920. As the company expanded into other animal products during and after the 1920s, it built factories outside of Wapakoneta, but it continued to use the old tannery at Auglaize and Blackhoof for manufacturing and as its corporate headquarters. Architecture Front of the building Built in 1872, the Wintzer Building was originally the company's primary tannery. As well as serving as an industrial facility, it was also built as a home; the Wintzers operated their business on the first story and lived on the second story. Its architecture is that of warehouses along the Miami and Erie Canal; although the Wintzers were Germans and built their home-and-office building in a German style, it includes distinct Italianate elements. Although the building had been converted into factory and corporate office space by the late 1970s, this was a relatively recent transition; the second floor remained a residence until at least 1969. Recognition On July 8, 2010, the Charles Wintzer Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, primarily because of its well-preserved historic architecture. In nominating the building for inclusion on the Register, the Ohio Historical Society concentrated on its place as an example of late nineteenth-century German architecture and on its combination of residential and industrial space under the same roof. Also important to this designation was its connection with G.A. Wintzer & Son, which still owns the building; as the oldest locally owned business operating in Auglaize County, the Wintzer Company is significant in local history. As the building has been constantly used as a factory by six generations of Wintzers, it is of significant importance in the history of Wapakoneta and the surrounding area.Wintzer Building Listed on National Register of Historic Places, Ohio Historical Society, 2010-07-19.

It is one of the oldest lines in Germany and forms the western end of the main line of the Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company (, BAE). The only passenger services to use the line are regional services. History  The Dessau‚ÄìK√∂then line opened on 1 September 1840 as the first section of the Anhalt Railway. On 10 September 1841 the line was completed to Berlin. Regular long-distance services ran between Berlin and K√∂then. Two daily services ran between Dessau and K√∂then. With the opening of direct Dessau‚ÄìLeipzig and Wittenberg‚ÄìHalle lines in 1859, the Dessau‚ÄìK√∂then increasingly lost its importance. The line lost almost all of its freight traffic with the opening of the nearby Canon Railway in 1879. In 1870/71 the BAE and the Magdeburg-Halberstadt Railway Company (MHE) opened a new K√∂then station in Georgstra√üe. In 1863, the MHE had acquired the K√∂then‚ÄìBernburg line, which had opened in 1846. The Magdeburg-Leipzig Railway continued to use its separate station in K√∂then. In 1916 a new central railway station was opened in K√∂then for all lines, slightly to the east of the 1870/71 station, requiring only limited rebuilding of trackwork. During this period most of the level crossings in K√∂then were replaced by bridges. At this time water tower to the east of the station, which is still preserved, was built. In the 1880s the route was nationalised and transferred to the Prussian State Railways. As part of reparations to the Soviet Union as a result of World War II, the second track of the Dessau-K√∂then line was removed and, in contrast to the lines to Bernburg, Magdeburg and Leipzig, was never rebuilt. The Deutsche Reichsbahn (the former East German Railways) sought in 1992 to rebuild the second track and to electrify the line along with the Bernburg line, because of their significance for freight traffic. However, even the freight traffic faded away during the post-Communist period. So the plans for electrification and duplication have been abandoned. Overall, the route has been modernised since the Deutsche Reichsbahn was merged into Deutsche Bahn in 1994 only sparingly, so that most of the old mechanical interlocking technology still exists. Route  The route begins in Dessau Hauptbahnhof, which has Regionalbahn connections with Magdeburg, Wittenberg, Halle ( Saale) and Leipzig, as well as a Regional-Express service to Berlin. Regionalbahn trains operate from platform 6. After a few metres, the line separates from the mainline to Bitterfeld. In Dessau it passes over a level crossings at K√ºhnauer Stra√üe and Brauereistra√üe. In this section, there are several, mostly unused, industrial sidings. Further on, the line passes under Hermann-K√∂hl-Stra√üe and a siding to the former Polysius AG factory. The line reaches Alten district. On the right is the airfield of the former Junkers factory. Shortly after passing over a level crossing of the H√ºnefeldstrasse is Alten station. Further on an industrial and commercial centre has been built on part of the former Junkers site, but without sidings. After a few kilometres of running through open countryside, the line reaches Mosigkau station and shortly later crosses Erich-Weinert-Strasse. The next station is at Elsnigk, which is now much too big for its small patronage. The line then goes onto the rolling plain around K√∂then. Running partly on embankments, the line reaches Osternienburg station in the locality of Sibbesdorf. Shortly before K√∂then the line crosses Highway 187a to Aken on one of the few modernised level crossings. A little later, the line from Aken converges from the north, but continues on its own parallel track to K√∂then. Shortly before K√∂then, both tracks runs below Elsdorfer Weg, as well as, somewhat later, the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalle (Saale) main line. The line now turns to the south on the eastern side of the Magdeburg‚ÄìHalle line, passing in K√∂then over the streets of Dessauer Stra√üe, Friedrichstrasse and Friedrich-Ebert-Stra√üe and finally reaching K√∂then station. Trains stop at the platforms 1, 2 and 3. There are connections to Intercity trains towards Leipzig and Magdeburg (continuing to Oldenburg or Cologne), as well as regional trains to Halle and Magdeburg. Operations Trains on the line have been operated since 2004 by the Elbe-Saale-Bahn, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, since winning a tender to operate the Altmark-B√∂rde-Anhalt network, with class 642 diesel multiple units (Siemens Desiro Classic) running as Regionalbahn services hourly. The trains continue on the Bernburg line to Aschersleben. The line has a small amount of freight traffic.

The album was released on April 6, 2010. The record company appeared initially to limit its initial release to 2,000 copies, but public interest in Black September resulted in an unlimited edition. Content There are a total of sixteen tracks including one in which the Warsaw resident disses rapper Tede that he recorded with after the incident in Zielona Gora where one of Peja's fan was beaten during a concert. Songs \\"All At My Expense\\", \\"TDF (The Dick Fucker)\\" and \\"Fat Smashing With Tede 3\\" comes from an EP issued under the name Gang SLU. However, compositions \\"Counter\\" and \\"Tell Me How It Feels\\" appeared on the second mini-album SLU Gang Fri Peja Kontruje. Artist comments The rap star says: :There were circumstances which made the unplanned recordings an album and only because Prince is not my third, but fourth solo album. For the majority of production on the fourth Hirass is responsible with Poznan as manufacturer. The album also has the participation of DJ Decks, which now we take to be \\"re-education\\"... It's not so easy to lead beef, when everything you say in an interview or a piece may be used against you in court.... Nevertheless, I waited patiently until this matter was completed in order to break the silence and talk about everything from my point of view.

The aim of the campaign is to discourage homeowners from considering these options and educate them in the environmental benefits of having a lawn. The campaign is currently supported by the RSBP and The Green Organisation. It encourages like-minded individuals to sign up as members. The initiative aims to provide them with the knowledge and skills to enable them to personally improve their own and national environments by changing their attitudes towards to the garden lawn and their mowing habits.

It is endemic to southern Brazil and only known from its type locality, Pico Marumbi, in the Serra do Mar in Morretes, Paran√° state. Its altitudinal range is above sea level. Etymology The specific name ferruginus is a Latin noun and means \\"rust\\" or \\"reddish-brown\\". This alludes to the dorsal reddish-brown markings of this species. Description As all brachycephalids, Brachycephalus ferruginus are small: adult males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length; this miniaturization is associated with loss of phalanges in hands and feet. The body is robust and toad-like. There is no tympanum. The general color is orange. There are irregular reddish-brown markings above; the underside has small dark brown spots, and the belly has small brownish spots and dots. The skin on top of the head and central part of the back body is smooth and without dermal co-ossification, whereas skin on the dorso-lateral surfaces of body, flanks, and dorsal surface of thighs is granular. A dissected female was found to contain three eggs. Eggs are probably terrestrial with direct development (i.e., no tadpole stage), as in B. ephippium. Habitat and conservation Brachycephalus ferruginus inhabit the leaf litter in the Atlantic Rainforest. They are active by day; males are exposed on the litter when calling. The species can be locally abundant. There are no known threats to this species, but it is only known from a single location. Its conservation status was last reviewed by the IUCN in 2008 where regarded as data deficient (insufficient information for rating it), but an independent review in 2019 that used IUCN's criteria recommended that B. ferruginus should be considered least concern (not threatened).

A former New Age traveller, he is the owner of the electricity company Ecotricity. Early life and career Vince was born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Leaving school at 15, he spent time as a New Age traveller. In 1991, he saw his first windfarm (\\"I thought, either I can carry on by myself with the windmill on my van, or I can get into the big stuff\\") and in 1995 he founded the Renewable Energy Company. In 1996, he launched his first wind turbine supplying \\"green electricity\\". Football In 2010 Vince became a major shareholder of Forest Green Rovers FC, and three months later was appointed club chairman. In February 2011, Rovers players were banned from eating red meat for health reasons, and a few weeks later the sale of all meat products was banned at the club's ground, leaving only vegetarian options and free-range poultry and fish from sustainable stocks. Vince has also introduced a number of different eco-friendly developments at the club including the installation of solar panels on its New Lawn home ground, the use of a solar- powered robot grass mower, and the creation of the world's first organic football pitch. In September 2015, Vince revealed Forest Green were using a player recruitment method similar to the 'Moneyball' model that had been initially used in baseball to sign players by using computer-generated analysis. In October 2015, Forest Green became the world's first all vegan football club. Honours Vince received an OBE from the Queen for services to the environment in 2004. In 2013, he was given the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Gloucestershire. Personal life He is a vegan. While studying, Vince met and married Kathleen Wyatt in 1981. The couple subsequently became New Age travellers together, and had a son in 1983. They separated some years later, and Wyatt subsequently raised the couple's son alone. They divorced in 1992. =Divorce and financial claim court case= After Vince had made his fortune, Wyatt, who had lived what was later described in court as \\"16 years of real hardship\\", lodged a financial claim of ¬£1.9 million against Vince in 2011, nearly 20 years after their divorce. The Court of Appeal rejected the claim, stating it had \\"no real prospect of success\\" and was an \\"abuse of process\\". However, in March 2015 the Supreme Court set aside this decision, ruling that there was no time limit in law for claims for financial provision, and the claim could progress in the High Court. Lord Wilson said the court must have regard \\"to the contribution of each party to the welfare of the family, including by looking after the home or caring for the family\\", but the claim only had a prospect of \\"comparatively modest success\\" with a ¬£1.9 million payout \\"out of the question\\". In a statement, Vince branded the court's decision \\"mad\\": \\"I feel that we all have a right to move on, and not be looking over our shoulders. This could signal open season for people who had brief relationships a quarter of a century ago.\\" Vince is paying legal costs for both parties, of over ¬£500,000 so far, as divorce law permits costs to be charged to the combined resources of both parties. Politics Vince has made donations to both the Labour Party and the Green Party. Prior to the 2015 UK general election, he was one of several celebrities who endorsed the parliamentary candidacy of the Green Party's Caroline Lucas.

The gate opens and the user steps in, scans their fingerprint and allows entry to Hong Kong. Locations e-Channel machines at Lok Ma Chau Station First made available on 16 December 2004 in Lo Wu Control Point, over the past several years the locations have expanded to include: *Hong Kong International Airport (T1 & T2) *Lo Wu *Hung Hom *Lok Ma Chau Spur Line *Lok Ma Chau *Man Kam To *Sha Tau Kok *Shenzhen Bay *Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal *Hong Kong-Macau Ferry Terminal *Kai Tak Cruise Terminal *Tuen Mun Ferry Terminal By allowing registered users to utilise the self-service kiosks to pass through Hong Kong immigration, processing time averages around 12 seconds making E-channels far more efficient than traditional immigration counters. Macau Since its first inception where only Right to Abode Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card holders were permitted to use the self-service kiosks, the program expanded on 12 September 2006; allowing not only those of Right to Land or those with unconditional stay in Hong Kong but also to those residents and non-residents with notification labels to use the E-Channels. The program was expanded further again on 10 December 2009 to allow holders of Macau Resident Identity Card to register for and use of the Hong Kong E-channels to enter and exit the territory. Vice versa, Macau have reciprocated and have their set of E-Channels and Hong Kong ID Card holders can register for those as well. Border cities to Macau and Hong Kong on the Mainland China's side - Zhuhai and Shenzhen (respectively) have their set of E-channels for use of the Home Return Permit cards. Example: A Hong Kong resident arrives at Lo Wu and passes through Hong Kong's E-Channel with his Hong Kong Identity Card allowing him to exit Hong Kong, upon approaching a border check point at Shenzhen, he uses his Home Return Permit on China's E-Channel to enter Mainland China.

He immigrated to the United States in 1854, and moved to Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1856, where he lived for most of the remainder of his life. Staub served as mayor of Knoxville in the early 1870s and early 1880s, and built the city's first opera house, Staub's Theatre, in 1872. Staub also aided Swiss immigration to the Southern Appalachian region, helping establish what is now the town of Gruetli-Laager, Tennessee, in 1869. In 1885, President Grover Cleveland appointed Staub U.S. Consul to Switzerland.East Tennessee Historical Society, Mary Rothrock (ed.), The French Broad-Holston Country: A History of Knox County, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: The Society, 1972), pp. 489-490, 499. Biography =Early life= Born in Switzerland, Staub was orphaned when he was eight years old. At age 13, he was apprenticed to a tailor, and worked in this trade in France and Switzerland throughout the 1840s. Staub married Rosina Blum in 1847. While living in Switzerland, they had two children, both of whom died at a young age. In 1854, Staub and his wife moved to the United States, initially settling in New Jersey. Shortly after his arrival, Staub's health began to decline. Concluding he would benefit from a more mountainous environment, Staub decided to move to East Tennessee, often advertised during this period as the \\"Switzerland of America.\\" In 1856, Staub opened a tailor shop on Gay Street in Knoxville. During the Civil War, Staub's house on the periphery of Knoxville was burned by the Union Army to prevent Confederate soldiers from using it for shelter.Robert McKenzie, Lincolnites and Rebels: A Divided Town in the American Civil War (NY: Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 165. He rebuilt it, and his tailoring business thrived in the post-war years. He reinvested his profits in real estate in the Knoxville area. =Staub's Theatre= Staub's Theatre (center), as it appeared on an 1886 map of Knoxville During the years following the Civil War, Knoxville gained a reputation for cultural backwardness that many of the city's residents found embarrassing. The Knoxville Whig and other newspapers called on the city's wealthy to fund construction of a respectable theater. In 1871, Staub announced he was building a three-story opera house at the corner of Gay and Cumberland, across the street from the Lamar House Hotel. One of the first major buildings designed by Knoxville architect Joseph Baumann, Staub's Theatre measured by and included a main hall, private boxes, a parquette, and a by stage. The theater opened on October 2, 1872, with a dedication by former congressman Thomas A. R. Nelson and a performance of Sheridan Knowles's William Tell by the Knoxville Histrionic Society. The play, based on the Swiss folk hero, was selected in honor of Staub.Lucile Deaderick, ed., Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, TN: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), pp. 158, 463-465. In subsequent decades, Staub's Theatre hosted performances by such diverse groups as Payson's English Opera Troupe, Boston's Mendelssohn Quintette Club, the Theodore Thomas Orchestra, and the Firmin-Jack Comedy Club, as well as lectures and readings, and minstrel shows. In the early 1900s, Staub's began to host vaudeville acts and wrestling matches, reflecting Knoxville's influx of working class migrants.John Kyle Thomas, \\"The Cultural Reconstruction of an Appalachian City: Knoxville, Tennessee, and the Coming of the Movies.\\" Journal of East Tennessee History, No. 65 (1993), pp. 34-35. =Public life= Staub obelisk at Old Gray Cemetery During the late 1860s, Staub began working with a group called the Tennessee Clonisation Gesellschaft, which sought to establish colonies of Swiss immigrants atop the Cumberland Plateau west of Knoxville. Staub purchased a large tract of land along a remote section of the Plateau in Grundy County in 1869 that provided the core of the Swiss colony of Gruetli (now Gruetli-Laager). The land proved too wooded, barren, and remote, however, and the colony failed to develop as Staub had envisioned.Claudette Stager, Gruetli. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 22 May 2012. Staub was first elected mayor of Knoxville in 1874. During his first term, he expanded the city's fire department, and organized the city's public school system.Robert Parkinson, Peter Staub. Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 18 August 2011. Staub was elected again in 1881 and spent much of this second term helping the city develop a public waterworks. In 1869, Staub was appointed consul for the Swiss government in Tennessee. In this capacity, he looked after Swiss interests in the state, including the Gruetli colony. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Staub a commissioner for the United States at the Paris Exposition of 1878. In 1885, President Cleveland appointed him United States Consul at St. Gallen, Switzerland. =Death= Staub was injured in a carriage accident on May 18, 1904, and died the following day. He is interred in a family plot, crowned by a large marble obelisk, in Old Gray Cemetery. Staub's son, Fritz, continued to operate Staub's Theatre for several years. The theater later changed its name to the Lyric Theatre and continued to host performances until 1956, when it was demolished. Knoxville's tallest building, the First Tennessee Plaza, now stands at the site.Jack Neely, The Seven Wonders of Ancient Knoxville. Metro Pulse, 12 July 2007. Accessed at the Internet Archive, 2 October 2015. Staub's grandson, John Fanz Staub (1892-1981), was a noted architect.

Location Aberlemno 1, 3 and 5 are located in recesses in the dry stone wall at the side of the road in Aberlemno (). Aberlemno 2 is found in the Kirkyard, 300 yards south of the roadside stones.() In recent years, bids have been made to move the stones to an indoor location to protect them from weathering, but this has met with local resistance and the stones are currently covered in the winter. Aberlemno 4, the Flemington Farm Stone was found 30 yards from the church (), and is now on display in the McManus Galleries, Dundee. Description =Aberlemno 1= Aberlemno 1 Aberlemno 1 is the central roadside stone. It is an unshaped standing stone, bearing incised Pictish symbols, defining it under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's classification system as a Class I stone. The symbols on one face: the serpent, the double disc and Z-rod and the mirror and comb. The meaning of these symbols is unknown. They are deeply incised in a bold, confident line, and this stone is considered to be one of the finest and best-preserved Pictish symbol stones still standing in or near its original position. The other face of the stone exhibits prehistoric cup marks, showing that it has been re-used. =Aberlemno 2= Aberlemno II, found in Aberlemno kirkyard, is a shaped cross-slab, bearing Pictish symbols as well as Christian symbols in relief, defining it as a Class II stone. The stone, carved from Old Red Sandstone, stands tall, wide at the base, tapering to wide at the top, and is thick. The west face is inscribed with a quadrilobate Celtic Cross. The cross bears several styles of Celtic pattern designs. The vertical arms are inscribed with three separate knotwork designs, the horizontal arms with keywork designs. The central roundel has a spiral design composed of three interconnecting triskeles. Bordering the cross are a number of Celtic zoomorphic designs, reminiscent of Northumbrian designs and designs from the Book of Kells. A hole has been bored through the upper part of the stone some time after its sculpting. The rear face features two Pictish symbols, a notched rectangle with z-rod and a triple disc. Below this are nine figures which have been interpreted as a narrative account of a battle. Until recently, it was thought to date to the mid-8th century, but subsequent analysis has suggested a mid-9th century date. =Aberlemno 3= Aberlemno 3 The western road-side stone is another Class II stone. It has an elaborately decorated ringed cross flanked by adoring angels on one side, and a hunting scene on the reverse, below two large Pictish symbols. This stone is known as Aberlemno 3. This stone has until recently been thought to date from the late eighth century. More recent comparative analyses have suggested that it may be of a later, mid-ninth-century origin. Aberlemno 3 has different proportions to the Kirkyard Cross-slab, being relatively tall and thin, with parallel sides which have incised decoration (those of the other cross-slab are plain). The monument's height and decoration on four faces both suggest it is later in date than Aberlemno 2. Its nearest artistic analogies appear to be sculptures from Easter Ross in northern Scotland, notable the Hilton of Cadboll stone (now in the Museum of Scotland), which has a closely similar hunting scene. =Aberlemno 4= This stone, found in 1961 is approximately 1.5 metres tall, 0.5 m wide and 0.3 m thick. It has incised symbols on an unworked stone, defining it under J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson's classification system as a Class I stone. There are two symbols, a horseshoe and a Pictish Beast. The anterior portion of the beast symbol (facing right) has suffered some damage due to ploughing, but is still easily visible. =Aberlemno 5= The eastern Class I stone is highly eroded and the incised symbols are extremely difficult to make out. This stone is thought to be unfinished or a later fake. This stone is known as Aberlemno 5. The battle scene on Aberlemno 2 Pictish Stone at Aberlemno Church Yard ‚Äì battle scene detail On the rear of Aberlemno 2 is a scene showing human figures bearing weapons, apparently engaged in battle. The figures appear in three rows. The top row has an unhelmeted figure on horseback riding behind a helmeted rider, possibly in pursuit. The helmeted rider is armed with a spear and appears to have dropped his sword and shield. The middle row has a helmeted rider armed with a spear and shield facing three unhelmeted infantry soldiers armed with spears, swords and shields. The bottom row shows a mounted and unhelmeted figure and mounted helmeted figure facing each other, both armed with spears. Behind the helmeted rider lies a helmeted casualty, with a bird to his right. The battle scene has been interpreted in numerous ways. The earliest record of the stone by Hector Boece, from the 16th century, links the scene with the Battle of Barry (now known to be historically inauthentic): > 82\\\\. Parem cladem nobilissimus Danorum manipulus est sortitus ad > Aberlemnonem vicum vix a Bretheno, nunc civitate episcopali sede honestata, > quatuor passuum millibus, qui a Scotis interceptus ibidem ferro occubuit. > Quo loco ingens lapis est erectus. Huic animantium effigies nonnullis cum > characteribus artificiose, ut tum fiebat, quae rem gestam posteritati > annunciarent, sunt insculptae. > > 82\\\\. A noble company of Danes suffered a similar slaughter near the village > of Aberlemno, a village four miles distant from Brechin (nowadays a city > possessing the honour of an episcopal see), which was intercepted by the > Scots and put to the sword. Here a great stone was erected, carved with > lifelike figures and an artfully-engraved inscription (according to the > lights of those days) to record this achievement for posterity. This interpretation persisted well into the mid-19th century, some time after antiquarian George Chalmers identified Dunnichen as a possible site of the Battle of Dun Nechtain. While it was noted in 1955 by Robert Stevenson, keeper of the Museum of Antiquities of Scotland that the helmets depicted on the stone were of a general sub-Roman design and the helmeted figures were likely to be Picts, the superficial similarity of the helmets with their long nasal, with the Anglo-Saxon Coppergate Helmet found at York in 1982 has led to the notion that the helmeted figures are Northumbrians. This, coupled with the stone's proximity to Dunnichen ( to the south) led to the interpretation made by historian Graeme Cruickshank that the scene was a depiction of the Battle of Dun Nechtain. This is a revised edition of Cruickshank's 1985 booklet. Cruickshank's interpretation, published in 1985, 1300 years after the Battle of Dun Nechtain, received general acceptance, although he has been criticised for his suggestions that the stone was created soon after the battle in 685, when the conventional view at the time was that it was sculpted a century later. The subsequent identification of Dunachton in Badenoch as a second candidate for the site of the battle, and the revised dating of the stone to the mid 9th century has weakened Cruickshank's argument somewhat, and alternative interpretations have been made, including that the scene depicts a battle between Picts and Vikings, or that it is a memorial to the 8th-century Pictish king √ìengus I, or even that it represents a spiritual struggle.

It originally aired as a holiday special on November 21, 2010, before the remaining episodes of Season 6 were broadcast in 2011. The episode features three self-contained segments, sponsored by the fictitious product \\"Gunderson's Unshelled Nuts\\". The first segment is based on \\"Xmas\\" (pronounced as \\"eks-mas\\"; a version of Christmas present in the 31st century), in which the long-extinct pine tree species is revived, but due to seed contamination grow out of control. The second segment is based on \\"Robanukah\\" (a holiday based on Chanukah, made-up by Bender to avoid work), in which Bender leads the crew on a search for petroleum oil in order for him to celebrate the holiday. In the third and final segment, the Planet Express crew go in search of beeswax, in order to create traditional beeswax candles for Kwanzaa. Each segment features recurring elements, including an environmental theme, a song, and ending in which most or all of the main characters either die or face certain death. Al Gore reprises his role as his own head in a jar in all three segments. Coolio reprises his role as Kwanzaabot in the third segment. Series producer David X.

Plot =Xmas= The gang are at a ski resort with fit trees which reminds Fry of Christmas, before the central plot proceeds. Robot Santa attacks the Planet Express building on Xmas Eve, explaining in song how the holiday should be celebrated. The crew are inspired to revive the pine tree, which became extinct in the 2200's, with seeds from the Svalbard Global Seed Vault. However, the seeds have been contaminated by a biological weapons repository neighboring the vault, causing pine trees to grow and spread at a rapid rate until they cover the entire Earth. Though the trees seem beneficial at first, returning the planet to a lush, wildlife- filled state, their uncontrolled growth produces dangerously high levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. When Bender lights a celebratory cigar, the sparks ignite the air and burn the planet to a cinder, killing the entire population. =Robanukah= Bender criticizes the crew for not celebrating his made-up robot holiday Robanukah from \\"Fear of a Bot Planet\\" and sings a song explaining it, detailing a tradition in which fembots must wrestle in petroleum oil for six and a half weeks. He is shocked to discover that they only have enough oil for four and a half weeks of wrestling and forces the crew to drill deep into the Earth with the Planet Express ship. Since all surface reserves of petroleum have been exhausted, the crew tunnels toward the Earth's core; the immense pressure crushes everyone to death except for Bender, who decides to take a nap. He wakes up 500 million years later and finds that the heat and pressure have turned his friends' bodies into petroleum oil. Returning to the now-dilapidated Planet Express building, he is surprised to find the two fembots still wrestling in their original supply of oil and declares it to be a Robanukah miracle. =Kwanzaa= The crew visit Hermes and his family for Kwanzaa, learning more about the holiday through a song by Kwanzaabot. Hermes' wife LaBarbara learns that she does not have the traditional beeswax candles required for Kwanzaa and sends Hermes to get some. However, the crew discover there is no beeswax in the world due to a colony collapse disorder caused by an infestation of blood-sucking mites. Accompanied by Kwanzaabot, they decide to return to the space beehive (from \\"The Sting\\") to collect some wax, but find the colony to be in disarray caused by the same mites. Hermes uses the Kwanzaa tenets to spread goodwill between the space bee drones, restoring harmony and killing the mites. However, the now-united swarm destroys Kwanzaabot and encases the crew members in wax to use as candles for its own Kwanzaa celebration. =Finale= A curtain descends and Al Gore appears to close the episode. He reminds the viewer that the characters will return in 2011, featuring himself as a major character called Captain Lance Starman. He then wishes the audience a happy holiday season on behalf of Gunderson's Unshelled Nuts as Amy dances in a costume advertising the product. Production The episode features three stand-alone, holiday- and environmentally-themed, musical segments, following the same structure as the episodes \\"Anthology of Interest I\\" and \\"Anthology of Interest II\\". However, unlike those episodes, it does not feature the \\"What If Machine\\". The episodes are not part of the series continuity. The three segments are based around the three winter holidays from previous Futurama episodes: Xmas, Kwanzaa and Robanukah (the holiday Bender made up to get out of work in \\"Fear of a Bot Planet\\"). Coolio reprised his guest-starring role of Kwanzaa-bot in the Kwanzaa segment. Al Gore also makes appearances as himself in the Xmas and Robanukah segments as well as the wrap-around segment closing out the episode.  Reception  In its original American broadcast, the episode was viewed by an estimated 1.302 million households. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a 9.0 citing it was worth watching. He explained that the weakest segment of the show was when Robot Santa made an appearance to help sing about the traditions of the holiday, but praised the two ending segments of the show.

History  In 1972, under the ownership of Greek millionaire Giannis Goulandris, Neorion incorporated Enfield Automotive, originally a British company, already owned by Goulandris, involved in the design and construction of electric cars. This led to the creation of a new company that undertook vehicle production, \\"Enfield-Neorion E.P.E.\\", headquartered in Piraeus, and production of the cars (which had been designed in the UK by British and Greek engineers) was transferred to Syros, where Neorion is based. Apart from the production of the electric cars, Goulandris wanted to develop \\"conventional\\" cars. One of his ideas was a mixture of a luxurious, retro-styled limousine with a very strong cross- country character and capabilities. The design and overall development of the car was assigned to a team of Greek engineers, headed by Georgios Michael. After eight months of development work, the Chicago (the name inspired by its 1930s retro-style), was built at the Neorion dockyards in the town of Ermoupoli, and a running version was introduced in 1974. Its construction included a steel chassis built by the Neorion shipyard and an aluminum body that incorporated additional reinforcements for passenger protection. The drivetrain came from the full-sized Jeep Wagoneer (SJ) and included the American Motors Corporation (AMC) V8 engine. Early sketches by Michael suggested a more elegant limousine with a strong retro-look. However, the final design was significantly altered to accommodate the mechanical parts and structure to cope with the desired cross-country capabilities. The designer tried to distance himself from the car (which he often described as a \\"mountain dinosaur\\"), arguing that Goulandris had essentially dictated its basic elements. After many years, even its designer seems to have finally given some credit to his own creation. A production line was started with four vehicles at various stages of construction when a change of Greek law condemned the market prospects of the car. Two complete vehicles were made and sold before the venture was terminated in 1976. One of the cars is exhibited in the Thessaloniki Science Center and Technology Museum. A second car is in a private collection.

The port was originally a trading post originally established by Greek settlers from the island of Vis and subsequently taken over by the Romans. The port thrived through the Middle Ages, but it suffered a decline in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when the Port of Rijeka took over as the primary trading and shipping outlet of the region. The decline was also attributed to the decline of the Ottoman Empire, a traditional market for the Port of Split, and the growing domination of Austrian Empire. As of 2017, the port ranks as the largest passenger port in Croatia, the largest passenger port in the Adriatic,Risposte Turismo: Adriatic Sea Tourism Report 2017, p. 24 and the 11th largest port in the Mediterranean,List of busiest ports in Europe#Busiest passenger ports with annual passenger volume of approximately 5 million. By 2010, the Port of Split recorded 18,000 ship arrivals each year. The port is managed by the Port of Split Authority (PSA). In the late 2000s, the PSA and the port operators, Trajektna Luka Split d.d. and Luka d.d. Split, started to implement an investment plan aimed at increasing both passenger and cargo traffic volume, scheduled to be completed by 2015, which would allow the port to handle up to 7 million passengers per year. Business operations The ferry Petar Hektoroviƒá departing the Port of Split The Port of Split is the largest passenger port in Croatia and the third largest passenger seaport in the Mediterranean. The port is administered by the Port of Split Authority, and the primary concessionaires Trajektna Luka Split and Luka d.d. Split, as well as 11 secondary concessionaires awarded concessions to use the port facilities or provide services in the port. The primary concessionaires are operating the City Port Split and Vranjic-Solin basin area, respectively, with the secondary concessionaires active in Vranjic-Solin area of the port and the terminals based in Ka≈°tela. The latter are Dalmacijacement, PROplin, Brodomerkur, Trast, Tehnospoj, Dujmovaƒça, ≈Ωitni Terminal, INA, Profectus, Eko Ka≈°telanski Zaljev and OMV companies. Passenger and vehicle transit is handled by a number of carriers; however in 2009 Jadrolinija share of the passenger traffic volume reached 85%. In 2009, total passenger traffic volume reached 3,995,846 passengers, representing a 3.3% drop compared to the previous year. The port serves seven island ferry lines, and four additional passenger shipping lines connecting nearby islands. There are such transport links to the islands of Braƒç and Hvar--carrying up to 2,000 and 1,000 vehicles per day during tourist seasons--as well as to islands of Vis, Lastovo, Korƒçula, ≈†olta, Drvenik Veliki, Drvenik Mali, providing regular transport links for a large area. In 2009, the ferry lines carried annual average daily traffic of 1,698 vehicles. During the summer peak season, the volume increases to a total of 3,812 vehicles on average. MV Dalmatia in the port of Split In 2008, the Port of Split recorded a total of 16,527 ship arrivals, and handled 2.7 million tonnes of cargo. In 2008, Luka d.d. Split, the primary cargo concessionaire company of the Port of Split, recorded substantial growth of transshipment volume. In the first nine months of the year, the company handled 276,000 tonnes of cargo, representing a growth rate of 20% achieved by that company. The cargo volume projected for the entire year was estimated at 345,000 tonnes, including 6,170 TEUs. The growth was permitted by investments made in late 2007, and the increased volume of operation brought about profit of approximately 2.4 million kuna (325,000 euro) in the first nine months of 2008. Overall port operations continue to grow, as 18,000 arrivals were recorded by 2010. Director of the Split Port Authority is Jo≈°ko Berket Bakota.

History USS Fort McHenry The first trading post at the site of the Port of Split was Aspalathos, established by Greek settlers from the island of Vis in the 4th century BC. Position of the trading post was selected because of its location in a natural harbor and its proximity to numerous Adriatic Sea islands and extensive hinterland populated by Illyrians, most notably in Salona. The area subsequently became a part of the Roman Empire, and after its Decline of the Roman Empire, the coast was brought under rule of the Byzantine Empire, until the area was absorbed into the Kingdom of Croatia in the beginning of the 10th century. In 1102, Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary were joined in a personal union. By the 12th century, Split had developed trading routes with its hinterland and maritime trade throughout the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean. The Republic of Venice of gained full control of Dalmatia and the city of Split by 1428. In the 16th century, Split was the central maritime trade outlet of the Balkans, where goods were transported from the Ottoman Empire, India and Persia to the Venetian Republic and vice versa. After the fall of Venice, Split was briefly ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy and Austrian Empire between 1797 and 1806, and the First French Empire until 1813 when Austrian rule was restored. In that period, trade routes shifted to other Adriatic ports, especially the Port of Rijeka, causing a downturn in the city's economy. In the second half of the 19th century, the economy of the city of Split and its surrounding area started to recover and Split soon became hub of the central Dalmatia, connecting the hinterland and the neighboring islands. This spurred development of the city port and its transport connections, including construction of a new breakwater and the Split‚ÄìKnin railway. In 1925, the railway was linked to the Rijeka‚ÄìZagreb railway via Gospiƒá, allowing development of a modern port. Since 1957, cargo terminals of the Port of Split were relocated from the city centre to industrial zones in Solin and Ka≈°tela areas, while passenger traffic still uses the centrally positioned harbor. =Future expansion= As of 2011, the Port of Split facilities are intended to be modernized to specialize in domestic and international passenger traffic. Consequently, St. Nicholas pier is planned to be extended and summer seasonal berths are scheduled to be added by 2015. The Resnik-Divulje passenger terminal is planned to be expanded within the framework of the second construction stage entailing two additional berths by the end of 2014. The expansions of the two passenger terminals are aimed at achieving passenger transport capacity of 7 million passengers per year. Two new berths capable of accommodating long cruise ships are also planned, and is expected to cost 100 million kuna (13.3 million euro) to construct. The container terminal in Vranjic-Solin basin is also expected to be modernized and its infrastructure is planned to be upgraded. Other segments of the port are scheduled to undergo comparably minor repairs as well.

It is endemic to Ecuador and is only known from the vicinity of its type locality on the western slope of the Cordillera Occidental in the Azuay Province. It has not been seen since 1990 and may now be extinct, but it is possible that overlooked populations remain. Etymology The specific name petersi honors Giovanni Onore, an Italian missionary priest and entomologist who has also made significant amphibian collections. Common name Onore's harlequin frog has been coined for it. Description Adult males measure and adult females in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is acuminate. The tympanic membrane is absent. The fingers have no lateral fringes nor webbing whereas the toes are webbed. The dorsum and the limbs are orange yellow with varying degrees of green coverage (covering all but the extremities in one male), or occasionally pale yellowish brown with diffuse black blotches. The iris is aqua blue, with fine black reticulation and a fine bluish-white stripe at the upper margin of pupil. Habitat and conservation Atelopus onorei was found in 1990 in cloud forest at the margin of the R√≠o Chipla at an elevation of about above sea level and by a nearby creek. The individuals were active at the daytime and numerous pairs were in amplexus. Atelopus onorei has never been seen again, despite several visits to the same site and its surroundings. The disappearance is attributed to the disease chytridiomycosis. Current threats are predation by trout and cattle grazing. If the species is not yet extinct, the remaining population is likely to be very small.

It is located in Baku Boulevard, in downtown Baku. Overview of the center The Mugham Center was built on initiative of the First Lady of Azerbaijan, Mehriban Aliyeva. Mugham is a genre included in the representative list of the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The official opening of the International Mugham Center took place on December 27, 2008. [5] UNESCO‚Äôs ninth Director-General Koichiro Matsuura also participated in that opening ceremony.  Architectural description  The construction of the building started in April, 2005. The center covers 7,500 square meters and has 3 stories. The funding was provided by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation. The design of the building was based on the elements and shapes of the tar, an Azeri musical instrument used in performing mugham. Furthermore, the center was commenced on the base of the architecture works of the Vahid Tansu, Xauddin Yayk and Etirne Ahmed. The concert hall fits 350 people. The center also has a club, 80-seat restaurant called \\"Ud\\", study halls and record studios. Modern heating and ventilation systems were also provided in the center. The building was constructed with equipments from Italy, Austria, France and Turkey. More than 2000 glasses with various sizes were used for the construction of the building.  Official naming of the center  The Cabinet of Ministers of Azerbaijan adopted Decree No. 103 relating to the certain Issues of the Mugham Center on the 2nd of the July, 2009. On the base of the decree, the center was transferred to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and changed the name from \\"Mugham Center\\" into the \\"International Mugham Center\\".  Target of the center  The center hosts mugham festivals, concerts, and recitals of various singers and performers. Young performers get aware of the art of mugham which has a special role in the Azerbaijani music culture. The center hosts famous masters, mugham evenings, international conferences as well as festivals.

The viewfinder thus acts as a kind of lens filter.\\"Mirroring Medusa: counterveillance in ShootingBack\\", Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Information Visualization, Jieun Rhee Dept. of Art History, Boston Univ., MA, pp408-412, 1999Steve Mann, ‚ÄúShootingBack.‚Äù The Art of Detection: Surveillance in Society. Ed. Jennifer Riddell. Exhibition catalogue at MIT List Visual Art Center. Cambridge: 1997.NPR, Seeing Things Through The Viewfinder (accessed July 29, 2010) The most popular method involves using a digital camera as the image taking camera and an intact twin-lens reflex camera (TLR) or pseudo-TLR as the \\"viewfinder\\" camera.Shutterbug, TtV Photography (accessed July 29, 2010) TLRs typically have square waist-level viewfinders, with the viewfinder plane at 90 degrees to the image plane. The image in a TLR viewfinder is laterally reversed, i.e. it is a mirror image. Most photographers use a cardboard tube or similar 'contraption' to connect the two cameras. This serves to eliminate stray light and prevent reflections appearing on the viewfinder glass or on the lens of the imaging camera. Set-up for through the viewfinder photography. The photograph is taken by a digital camera, top, through the viewfinder of a Kodak Duaflex box camera. The two cameras are linked by a cardboard tube to block out excess light and avoid reflections from the Duaflex glass. Public exhibit on through the viewfinder videography, by S. Mann, LVAC (List Visual Arts Center), October 1997. The video is taken by EyeTap Generation-2 Glass (shown here worn by the mannequin) through the viewfinder of a hand-held video camera. The wearer of the EyeTap records what is seen while looking into the eyecup of the hand-held camera, resulting in what Mann refers to as a \\"Meta Documentary\\" (a documentary about making a documentary). Depending on the model of TLR, the resulting image may have an old-fashioned feel to it, often with vignetting, blurred edges, distortion and dust. TLR models popular among TtV photographers have a brilliant type ('bubble glass') viewfinder. They include the Ansco Anscoflex, Argus 75, Kodak Duaflex and Kodak Brownie. History While waist-level viewfinders have been common in box cameras since the beginning of the 20th century, large viewfinders of the sort that are suitable for ttv photography became popular in the late 1920s and 1930s with medium format TLR and pseudo TLR cameras such as the Rolleiflex and the Voigtl√§nder Brillant. Similar large, clear square viewfinders were popular in TLRs and pseudo TLRs until the mid-1960s. These medium format cameras became less popular with the advent of 35mm SLRs and compact cameras in the 1960s and 1970s. The idea of photographing an image through the viewfinder of such a camera is relatively new, and ttv photography and filmography has come into use with the advent of digital cameras and EyeTap devices. Before the advent of digital photography it was necessary to use extension tubes to photograph a close-up object such as a viewfinder, and it was difficult to judge focusing precisely. Both compact digital cameras and digital SLRs are able to focus on close objects without the need for extension tubes, and their autofocus function and digital viewing screen make it easy to focus and judge framing and exposure. Moreover, the EyeTap device captures exactly what the eye sees, and therefore can capture video recordings of anything that the human eye can look into. It is thus much better suited to this type of photography/videography than most previously known cameras. U.S. Patent 6614408 (S. Mann, 1999), entitled \\"Eye-tap for electronic newsgathering, documentary video, photojournalism, and personal safety\\", describes this method of using 2 cameras, the first of which is a wearable camera, and the second camera is handheld, so as to record the experience of one camera looking through a second camera: (emphasis added) In addition, the popularity of digital photography and of on-line auction sites has led to a big increase in the number lot of older medium format TLRs and pseudo TLRs on the second hand market. Many people find it more convenient to use these cameras for TtV photography than to use them with film. Ttv video Videos shot using Ttv are known as \\"Meta Documentaries\\", an example of which was ShootingBack, by S. Mann, in which a covert EyeTap wearable camera was used to shoot through the viewfinder of various standard hand-held video and motion picture film cameras. In some situations both of the two cameras record, and the resulting \\"Meta Documentary\\" is edited down from both camera feeds (the camera being looked into, as well as the camera that's looking into its viewfinder). In other cases, the second camera is just a \\"dummy\\" camera that does not actually record, and its purpose is only to be looked through. Equipment and practicalities A photographer demonstrating the TtV technique (left); resultant photograph (right). Note mirrored image and post processing color adjustments in the TtV photo. Shot with a Nikon D90 through a Kodak Brownie Relfex Synchro. The following equipment is required. 1 A \\"bottom camera\\" through the viewfinder of which the photograph will be taken. Typically this is a medium format TLR or pseudo TLR. 2 A \\"top camera\\" which will be used to take the photograph. Typically this is a digital SLR or digital compact camera with a macro lens or macro function. 3 A \\"contraption\\" to link the two cameras and block out any excess light. The contraption may be a simple cardboard tube, or an open ended box that fits around the bottom camera. Post- processing Post-processing can be done with image editing software. This normally involves cropping the image to a square and straightening it. The cropping is necessary because in most cases the (normally square) viewfinder image covers only about 25- 50% of the area of the (normally rectangular) digital picture. Additionally some photographers prefer to 'flip' the TtV image so that it is no longer a mirror image, especially if the image contains lettering. Color and saturation adjustments depend on the taste of the photographer, some photographers prefer to keep such adjustments to a minimum while others prefer more radical adjustments, such as the \\"Urban Acid\\" action for the image editing programs Adobe Photoshop or GIMP.

He became a military cadet in the Austro-Hungarian Army in 1897 in Vienna, and got a rapid advance in rank during World War I. By 1918, he was a lieutenant colonel. He later served the Hungarian Soviet Republic after the collapse of Austria-Hungary as the commander of the Hungarian Red Army's I Army Corps before being given command of the 7th Infantry Division. Werth continued serving after the fall of the communist regime, being promoted to colonel in 1920, and to major general in 1926. He taught at the general staff academy and briefly served as the chief of operations on the general staff during that time. Werth was given mandatory retirement at age of 55, which he reached in 1936. However, he was recalled up into service in 1938 and became the chief of general staff. Of German ancestry, he supported Hungary's entry into World War II and believed that Hungary could profit from helping the Germans. He was later dismissed from his post because of making a promise to the Germans that all Hungarian Army units would be available to them (without the permission of Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy). He was recalled from retirement in February 1945 by the Soviet forces, and was immediately arrested. The Hungarian People's Court sentenced him to death because of war crimes.

The museum, formerly known as the Riverside Metropolitan Museum, is a department of the City of Riverside, but is supported by the Riverside Museum Associates (RMA) and the Harada House Foundation (HHF), two independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations. Its mission is: \\"As a center for learning, the Museum of Riverside interacts with the community to collect, preserve, explore, and interpret the cultural and natural history of Riverside and its region.\\" History The museum was established on December 12, 1924, when the widow of Cornelius Earle Rumsey donated his collection of Native American artifacts to the City of Riverside. Rumsey, a retired executive of the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco), came to Riverside for his health and subsequently developed an interest in Native American artifacts.Patterson, page 345. The museum was originally located in the basement of the old City Hall building from 1925 through 1948. It then moved to the basement of the current building, originally a Federal Post Office. For many years, the museum shared its site with the city's police department, the U.S.D.A, and, during World War II, the Fourth Air Force. As the museum's collections and exhibitions grew, it expanded to all of the floors in the 1960s and 1970s.BID Bulletin, Riverside Downtown Business Improvement District, September 2010, Volume 11, Issue 9, page 2. In 1978, its downtown Riverside site earned its place on the National Register of Historic Places. Over time, the collections grew to an estimated 200,000 artifacts and specimens, including 2,500 linear feet of archives in the disciplines of history, natural history, and Indigenous cultural resources documenting the growth and development of Riverside and the surrounding areas from before its founding as a human settlement until the present. These collections include a notable Native American basketry collection; archival collections documenting the two National Historic Landmarks of Riverside (the Mission Inn and Harada House); the nationally respected Clark Herbarium of mounted botanical specimens; artifacts and equipment that represent Riverside‚Äôs citrus industry in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; and archaeological material from Riverside's Chinatown. Collections include additional strengths in geology, entomology, and textiles. The Museum is steward of the National Register Heritage House and the National Historic Landmark Harada House. Heritage House, an 1891 Queen Anne-style Victorian-era home, has served since 1977 as a Victorian house museum representing life in Riverside in the 1890s, the heyday of Riverside‚Äôs citrus industry. Harada House is among the most significant and powerful civil rights landmarks in California. The site and story of the Harada family embody local, state, national, and international issues of civil and individual rights, democracy, immigration, assimilation, citizenship, and diversity. After his retirement from teaching at Riverside Junior College, noted naturalist Edmund C. Jaeger served as a curator for the museum and substantially enhanced the botanical collections. Noted anthropologist Christopher Moser also served on staff for many years until 2003. The museum was among the first museums in the nation to be accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). Architecture The building was designed in the Neo-Classical style of architecture, as it appeared in Southern California with Mission Revival details and a ceramic tile roof evoking Spanish-style architecture.

Career  Osojnak played for Rijeka and Dinamo Zagreb in the 1940s and 1950s. He is considered as the most notable football player from Opatija, and one of the five greatest forwards in the early history of HNK Rijeka (along with Bruno Veselica, Miodrag Kustudiƒá, Milan Radoviƒá and Tonƒçi Gulin). Osojnak was also notable for appearing in the first ever match played by Dinamo Zagreb on 23 June 1945, a friendly game against the Yugoslav Air Force team played in Zagreb. However, Osojnak was dropped from the squad before the club started competing in post-war championships and he did not appear for the club in competitive matches in the following seasons. Between the late 1940s and early 1950s he had his first spell at NK Rijeka (named \\"NK Kvarner\\" at the time) and scored 45 league goals for the club in the period from 1949 and 1953. In 1953 he was signed by Dinamo Zagreb and this time he appeared in 22 league matches and scored 11 goals over the next three Yugoslav First League seasons, appearing alongside other Dinamo greats such as ≈Ωeljko ƒåajkovski, Tomislav Crnkoviƒá, Dionizije Dvorniƒá, Vladimir ƒåonƒç and Luka Lipo≈°inoviƒá. He is mainly remembered for his performances in the title-winning 1953‚Äì54 season, in which he scored 9 goals in 10 league appearances for the Blues, including the crucial goal against Red Star Belgrade at Maksimir on 25 April 1954, which sealed Dinamo's second championship triumph. In 1955 he returned to Rijeka and played there until his retirement in 1959, scoring 26 goals for the club in his last four playing seasons. After retiring from active football, Osojnak started working as manager and had three managing spells at NK Rijeka (1960‚Äì1961, 1962‚Äì1963 with Angelo Zikovich and 1964‚Äì1967), his greatest achievements being finishing 4th in the Yugoslav championship in 1964‚Äì65 and 1965‚Äì66.

Memory geometry is of concern to consumers upgrading their computers, since older memory controllers may not be compatible with later products. Memory geometry terminology can be confusing because of the number of overlapping terms. The geometry of a memory system can be thought of as a multi-dimensional array. Each dimension has its own characteristics and physical realization. For example, the number of data pins on a memory module is one dimension.  Physical features  DDR2 DIMM with heat-spreader, DDR2 DIMM without heat-spreader, SO-DIMM DDR2, DDR, SO-DIMM DDR Memory geometry describes the logical configuration of a RAM module, but consumers will always find it easiest to grasp the physical configuration. Much of the confusion surrounding memory geometry occurs when the physical configuration obfuscates the logical configuration. The first defining feature of RAM is form factor. RAM modules can be in compact SO-DIMM form for space constrained applications like laptops, printers, embedded computers, and small form factor computers, and in DIMM format, which is used in most desktops. The other physical characteristics, determined by physical examination, are the number of memory chips, and whether both sides of the memory \\"stick\\" are populated. Modules with the number of RAM chips equal to some power of two do not support memory error detection or correction. If there are extra RAM chips (between powers of two), these are used for ECC. RAM modules are 'keyed' by indentations on the sides, and along the bottom of the module. This designates the technology, and classification of the modules, for instance whether it is DDR2, or DDR3, and whether it is suitable for desktops, or for servers. Keying was designed to make it difficult to install incorrect modules in a system (but there are more requirements than are embodied in keys). It is important to make sure that the keying of the module matches the key of the slot it is intended to occupy. Additional, non-memory chips on the module may be an indication that it was designed for high capacity memory systems for servers, and that the module may be incompatible with mass-market systems. As the next section of this article will cover the logical architecture, which covers the logical structure spanning every populated slot in a system, the physical features of the slots themselves become important. By consulting the documentation of your motherboard, or reading the labels on the board itself, you can determine the underlying logical structure of the slots. When there is more than one slot, they are numbered, and when there is more than one channel, the different slots are separated in that way as well ‚Äì usually color-coded.  Logical features  In the 1990s, specialized computers were released where two computers that each had their own memory controller could be networked at such a low level that the software run could use the memory, or CPU of either computer as if they were one unit. With AMD's release of the Opteron, and Intel's corresponding CPU, systems that share more than one memory controller in a single system have become common in applications that require the power of more than one common desktop. For these systems schemes like non-uniform memory architecture are used. Channels are the highest-level structure at the local memory controller level. Modern computers can have two, three or even more channels. It is usually important that, for each module in any one channel, there is a logically identical module in the same location on each of the other populated channels. Module capacity is the aggregate space in a module measured in bytes, or ‚Äì more generally ‚Äì in words. Module capacity is equal to the product of the number of ranks and the rank density, and where the rank density is the product of rank depth and rank width.. The standard format for expressing this specification is (rank depth) Mbit √ó (rank width) √ó (number of ranks). Ranks are sub-units of a memory module that share the same address and data buses and are selected by chip select (CS) in low-level addressing. For example, a memory module with 8 chips on each side, with each chip having an 8-bit-wide data bus, would have one rank for each side for a total of 2 ranks, if we define a rank to be 64 bits wide. A module composed of Micron Technology MT47H128M16 chips with the organization 128 Mib √ó 16, meaning 128 Mi memory depth and 16-bit-wide data bus per chip; if the module has 8 of these chips on each side of the board, there would be a total of 16 chips √ó 16-bit-wide data = 256 total bits width of data. For a 64-bit-wide memory data interface, this equates to having 4 ranks, where each rank can be selected by a 2-bit chip select signal. Memory controllers such as the Intel 945 Chipset list the configurations they support: \\"256-Mib, 512-Mib, and 1-Gib DDR2 technologies for √ó8 and √ó16 devices\\", \\"four ranks for all DDR2 devices up to 512-Mibit density\\", \\"eight ranks for 1-Gibit DDR2 devices\\". As an example, take an i945 memory controller with four Kingston KHX6400D2/1G memory modules, where each module has a capacity of 1 GiB.https://www.kingston.com/datasheets/KHX6400D2_1G.pdf Kingston describes each module as composed of 16 \\"64M√ó8-bit\\" chips with each chip having an 8-bit-wide data bus. 16 √ó 8 equals 128, therefore, each module has two ranks of 64 bits each. So, from the MCH point of view there are four 1 GB modules. At a higher logical level, the MCH also sees two channels, each with four ranks. In contrast, banks, while similar from a logical perspective to ranks, are implemented quite differently in physical hardware. Banks are sub-units inside a single memory chip, while ranks are sub-units composed of a subset of the chips on a module. Similar to chip select, banks are selected by bank select bits, which are part of the memory interface. Hierarchy of organization =Memory chip= The lowest form of organization covered by memory geometry, sometimes called \\"memory device\\". These are the component ICs that make up each module, or module of RAM. The most important measurement of a chip is its density, measured in bits. Because memory bus width is usually larger than the number of chips, most chips are designed to have width, meaning that they are divided into equal parts internally, and when one address \\"depth\\" is called up, instead of returning just one value, more than one value is returned. In addition to the depth, a second addressing dimension has been added at the chip level, banks. Banks allow one bank to be available, while another bank is unavailable because it is refreshing. =Memory module= Some measurements of modules are size, width, speed, and latency. A memory module consists of a multiple of the memory chips to equal the desired module width. So a 32-bit SIMM module could be composed of four 8-bit wide (√ó8) chips. As noted in the memory channel part, one physical module can be made up of one or more logical ranks. If that 32-bit SIMM were composed of eight 8-bit chips the SIMM would have two ranks. =Memory channel= A memory channel is made up of ranks. Physically a memory channel with just one memory module might present itself as having one or more logical ranks. =Controller organization= This is the highest level. A typical computer has only a single memory controller with only one or two channels. The logical features section described NUMA configurations, which can take the form of a network of memory controllers. For example, each socket of a two-socket AMD K8 can have a two-channel memory controller, giving the system a total of four memory channels. Memory geometry notation Various methods of specifying memory geometry can be encountered, giving different types of information. =Module= (memory depth) √ó (memory width) The memory width specifies the data width of the memory module interface in bits. For example, 64 would indicate a 64-bit data width, as is found on non-ECC DIMMs common in SDR and DDR1‚Äì4 families of RAM. A memory of width of 72 would indicate an ECC module, with 8 extra bits in the data width for the error-correcting code syndrome. (The ECC syndrome allows single-bit errors to be corrected). The memory depth is the total memory capacity in bits divided by the non-parity memory width. Sometimes the memory depth is indicated in units of Meg (220), as in 32√ó64 or 64√ó64, indicating 32 Mi depth and 64 Mi depth respectively. =Chip= (memory density) This is the total memory capacity of the chip. Example: 128 Mib. (memory depth) √ó (memory width) Memory depth is the memory density divided by memory width. Example: for a memory chip with 128 Mib capacity and 8-bit wide data bus, it can be specified as: 16 Meg √ó 8. Sometimes the \\"Mi\\" is dropped, as in 16√ó8. (memory depth per bank) √ó (memory width) √ó (number of banks) Example: a chip with the same capacity and memory width as above but constructed with 4 banks would be specified as 4 Mi √ó 8 √ó 4.

Simone was born in Bahia and raised in Bras√≠lia. She began composing as a teenager, revealing innate musical talent of eclectic style. In the late 1970s, she accepted the invitation from Alvim Barbosa, then director of Sala Funarte in Bras√≠lia, to perform her first show, thus beginning her career as a singer. For four years she performed several shows praised in the Brazilian capital and throughout the country, performing three seasons at Sala Funarte. However, soon after she decides to move away from the stage and dedicate herself to journalism and showbiz, maintaining her artistic activity as a composer and writer. In 2002, the increasingly intense musical partnerships make her move to Rio de Janeiro. In that decade, she bursts as composer in the voices of Z√©lia Duncan and Frejat, with the song M√£os Atadas. The recording was homage from Z√©lia to C√°ssia Eller, with whom she used to sing the blues on the musical scene of Bras√≠lia, in the early 80's. From then on, her compositions have been recorded by many singers, among other artists, by F√°bio Jr., Leonardo, Dillo Daraujo, Ronaldo Barcelos, by the duo Z√©lia Duncan and Simone and by Ana Carolina, who released the hit Vai. In 2012, the unpublished song Flor do Sol ‚Äì composed thirty years before in partnership with C√°ssia Eller and recorded on a simple cassette tape ‚Äì was released as a single by Porangaret√© label. The track, reworked by Chico Chico (Eller's son), with his participation and C√°ssia's former musicians, was officially released on TV Globo's \\"Fant√°stico\\", to celebrate the day C√°ssia Eller would have turned 50. In 2016, Simone Saback releases another single: M√£os Atadas, in the voices and guitars of herself and C√°ssia Eller's. This track is also based on the recording of their rehearsal on a simple cassette tape, and carried out at Simone's house in 1982. The record was digitized and arranged by the Brazilian musician Dillo Daraujo.

Her parents died when she was young, leaving her their substantial fortune. In 1748, aged 17, she married her cousin Benedict Swingate Calvert, a Loyalist politician and planter and the illegitimate son of Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore. Benedict's connections to the ruling Calvert family allowed him to benefit from considerable proprietarial patronage, until the American Revolution saw the overthrow of British rule and the end of Calvert power in Maryland. Benedict and Elizabeth had to pay triple taxes after the war's end but, unlike many loyalists, their lands and fortune remained unconfiscated. Elizabeth was the grandmother of Charles Benedict Calvert (1808‚Äì1864), a U.S. Congressman who founded what is now the University of Maryland, College Park, chartered in 1856.Prince George's Parks: History of Riversdale House Museum Retrieved Jan 20 2010 Elizabeth's portrait, painted by John Wollaston, still hangs on display, along with those of many of her Calvert relatives, in the Baltimore Museum of Art.

Elizabeth's father, Governor Charles Calvert Elizabeth's father Captain Calvert (1680‚Äì1734) was governor of Maryland at a time when the Calvert family had recently regained control of their proprietary colony. He was appointed Governor by his cousin Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore, who in 1721 would travel to Maryland to take personal charge of the colony. Captain Calvert's parentage is not entirely clear since neither of his parents has been positively identified but it has long been assumed that his father was Charles Calvert, 3rd Baron Baltimore, 2nd Proprietor Governor of Maryland (1637‚Äì1715). His mother's identity is unknown but, judging by the Calvert family papers, she appears to have been the Countess Henrietta, also known as \\"Mother Calvert\\", who died circa 1728.Yentsch, p.55 Captain Calvert was replaced as governor in 1725.Yentsch, p.40 He suffered from early senility and died in 1734. Elizabeth's mother, Rebecca Gerard (1708-1734/35), was a landed heiress from Maryland.Yentsch, p.64 Rebecca was just sixteen when the couple were married on November 21, 1722 by the rector of Queen Anne's parish, a marriage which \\"enlivened the whole winter season with entertainments for the new first lady\\", wrote Aubrey Land. She was an only child and on her marriage her property, a plantation near Queen Anne's Town in Prince George's County, passed to Captain Calvert.Yentsch, p.65 Elizabeth had a brother, Charles (1723-1723/4), who died in infancy,Yentsch, p.66 and a sister, Anne (1724-c1737), who died in childhood. Elizabeth's godfather was Captain Calvert's cousin, Benedict Leonard Calvert, governor of Maryland from 1727 to 1731, and second son of Benedict Calvert, 4th Baron Baltimore. Benedict Calvert died of consumption in 1732, while sailing to his home in England.Yentsch, p.93 In his will, which he drew up before leaving Maryland, he left Elizabeth, then just one year old, a slave boy named Osmyn.Yentsch, p.61 Captain Calvert suffered from early senility and died on February 2, 1734.Yentsch, p.69 He had arrived in Maryland a relatively poor man, but died one of the wealthiest men in the Province.

On May 13, 1777 Elizabeth's husband was forced to resign his position as Judge of the Land Office,Yentsch, p.269 and, as the conflict grew, Benedict became fearful of his family's safety, writing in late 1777 that his family \\"has been made so uneasy by these frequent outrages\\" that he wished to \\"remove my family and property where I can get protection\\".Yentsch, p.272 Despite the danger, Elizabeth did not leave Maryland. On occasion she and her husband supplied the Continental Army with food and provisions. =After the war= After the war's end, the Calverts had to pay triple taxes as did other Loyalists, but they were never forced to sign the loyalty oath and their lands and property remained unconfiscated.Yentsch, p.270 Curiously, Elizabeth and her husband's Loyalism does not appear to have affected their family's cordial relations with the leader of the Revolution, George Washington. In 1783, after the war was over, Washington stayed with the Calverts at their Mount Airy plantation, shortly after resigning his commission in Annapolis On December 23. Because the Calverts were known Loyalists, the visit drew much criticism from Washington's political enemies.Duyckinck, Evert Augustus, p.372, Cyclopaedia of American Literature, Embracing Personal and Critical Notices of Authors, and Selections from Their Writings, Volume 2, Nabu Press (2010) Retrieved Feb 1 2010 Elizabeth died in 1788, at the age of 57. Legacy The Calverts' house at 58 State Circle, Annapolis, was the subject of an archeological dig in the 1980s and early 1990s. The results of the dig, along with much other research, were published in 1994 by Anne Elizabeth Yentsch in her book A Chesapeake Family and their Slaves, published by Cambridge University Press. The excavation of the Calvert House was financed by Historic Annapolis Inc, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and other institutions.Yentsch, p.xxiii She is buried beside her husband in Page's Chapel, St. Thomas' Church Croom, Maryland.

Playing career Kuryanov started his career in Ust-Kamenogorsk before moving to Omsk in 1998 along with his coach Sergei Gersonsky and a bunch of other talented youngsters, including Alexander Perezhogin. Since he was considered less talented than other young forwards like Alexander Svitov and Stanislav Chistov who played in Avangard Omsk at the time, Kuryanov's path to seniors was a difficult one. He was sent on loan to Mostovik (Kurgan) and then HC Sibir Novosibirsk to gain first-team experience before making his debut for Avangard in the 2002‚Äì03 season. In his first full season in Avangard's jersey, Anton Kuryanov helped his team to win the title tallying 14 points in the process. He then went from strength to strength getting capped for Russia in December 2004 and becoming fans' favourite at his own club. In the 2006‚Äì07 season, Kuryanov scored 30 goals which became the record for an Avangard player. On October 13, 2008, Kuryanov suffered a major career setback and a psychological blow when Alexei Cherepanov with whom they played in the same line collapsed on the bench and died during the game against Vityaz Chekhov. Anton Kyryanov also achieved significant success on the international arena when he was invited to represent his country at the 2009 IIHF World Championship which Russia went on to win. Kuryanov scored 3 times and made 3 assists during his 9 games at the tournament. He dedicated this victory to Cherepanov.

Therefore an English translation would be 'Mahon's/ O'Mahon's Ridge'. The most striking architectural feature of the area is a large tower house, now totally derelict. It belonged to Stephen McEgan and was made over to Nicholas White during the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland when the latter was awarded lands in Ireland. It is a square castle 47 ft by 35 ft and the walls are 7 ft thick. It belongs to the 14th century. It was originally five storeys high, with the second floor resting on a stone arch. The walls were well grouted and the stone staircase passed through the thickness of the south and east walls. The windows were rectangular and constructed of chiselled limestone.

It is endemic to Batu Linanit in Mount Murud in Sarawak, Borneo. Description Pelophryne linanitensis is a mid-sized species within its genus: adult males measure in snout‚Äìvent length; females are unknown. The head is wider than it is long. The snout is vertical in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct. Supratympanic fold and parotoid gland are absent. The fingers are extremely short and stout, and with extensively webbed. The toes are long and almost fully webbed. The dorsum is predominantly brown and bears an indistinct, lighter brown hour-glass pattern. Males have a subgular vocal sac. The male advertisement call consists of a metallic \\"ping\\" note that is repeated 4‚Äì5 times in a call series. Habitat and conservation The type series was collected from rhododendron forest at the wind-swept summit of Batu Linanit at above sea level. The males were found calling from leaves just above the ground that was covered by deep layer of moss, leave litter, and roots. The larval habitat is unknown but could be Nepenthes pitchers, near which the males were found. The type locality is within the Pulong Tau National Park, but habitat loss is occurring within the park. Climate change is also a likely future threat to this species. It is likely a summit specialist with very limited range, likely about 1 km¬≤.

The TV series is set in the 1970s during and just after the Cultural Revolution. It follows four childhood friends - three males and one female - as they joined the Kunlun Division of the People's Liberation Army and are posted to √úr√ºmqi and the Kunlun Mountains. The series chronicles their army and love lives as the two of the males become border guards and the female a combat medic. The series debuted on CCTV-1 on 26 July 2009http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hqyl/2009-07/22/content_8550715.htm and comprises 29 episodes. Plot The series follows four childhood friends - Yuan Ying, Ding Haotian, Fang Yang and L√º Qiang - as they join the Kunlun Division of the PLA in the early 1970s. All four are idealistic young people looking to defend their country. Yuan Ying, the only girl, is the sole daughter of a middle-aged couple of a military background; however, she is really the biological daughter of her adopted father's former military colleague, now the Commandant of the Kunlun Division, Wei Tie. The series follows the love and army lives of the four friends, especially between Ding Haotian, L√º Qiang and Yuan Ying. Ding Haotian and L√º Qiang become border guards, Yuan Ying becomes a medic and Fang Yang a driver. It also deals with Yuan Ying's changing relationship with her true parents and wilful sister Wei Jie, although none are aware of their true ties at the series' start. The series ends with Yuan Ying sacrificing herself to save natives during a snow- storm and the subsequent avalanche. Although the series is set in the 1970s, the series contains very little reference to the Cultural Revolution. Main Cast (simplified Chinese)  *Li Youbin (ÊùéÂπºÊñå) as Commandant Wei Tie (Èü¶ÈìÅ) **Commandant of the PLA's Kunlun Division. He gives away his elder daughter, Yuan Ying, to a fellow army mate years ago after discovering the latter was rendered infertile on battlefield. He hides his love for his daughters behind a mask of sternness. *Yin Tao (ÊÆ∑Ê°É) as Yuan Ying (Ë¢ÅÈπ∞) **The protagonist of the series: an idealistic, warm-hearted girl who eventually becomes a combat medic. She is well liked by soldiers and colleagues at the Kunlun Division alike. She is involved in a relationship with L√º Qiang and is really the daughter of Commandant Wei Tie, although she only learns the truth toward the series' end. *Wu Jian (Âê¥ÂÅ•) as L√º Qiang (ÂêïÂº∫) **One of the three male buddies featured in the series. He ends up as a border guard at Kunlun Mountains, which he hates, preferring to stay at the Kunlun Division HQ. He loves Yuan Ying but eventually breaks up with her to be with Wei Jie, the Commandant's daughter. *Shen Xiaohai (Ê≤àÊôìÊµ∑) as Ding Haotian (‰∏ÅÊµ©Â§©) **A tough but idealistic young man who is secretly in love with childhood friend Yuan Ying. He, like his friend L√º Qiang, ends up as a border guard at Kunlun Mountains after signing up with the PLA and becomes the guards' chief cook. Unlike L√º, he learns to love his job. He is also a poet. *Gu Yan (È°æÁáï) as Gui Hongyun (Ê°ÇÁ∫¢‰∫ë) **PLA doctor, wife of Commandant Wei Tie and mother to Wei Jie and Yuan Ying. She is prejudiced against Yuan Ying at the start of the series but her attitude changes totally when she realizes Yuan is her long-lost daughter. *Song Wenfei (ÂÆãÊ±∂Èúè) as Wei Jie (Èü¶Ê¥Å) **Commandant Wei Tie and army doctor Gui Hongyun's daughter. She is the younger sister of Yuan Ying (although neither knows this until well into the second half of the series). Wei Jie is somewhat spoilt and hard to get along with. She eventually marries L√º Qiang, although she used to adore Ding Haotian's gift as a poet. *Ji Ta (Âß¨‰ªñ) as Fang Yang (ÊñπÊâ¨) **The third of the three buddies at the series' start. He is the most street smart of the three, and ends up being a HQ truck driver. He sides with Ding Haotian against L√º Qiang after the two's relationship deteriorates. Reception In That Distant Place was very well received during its premiere on CCTV-1, averaging around 6.27 points in viewership.http://ent.sina.com.cn/v/m/2009-07-28/17102628478.shtmlhttp://yule.sohu.com/20090820/n266109319.shtml Mainstream newspapers and audiences alike gave high praise to the series.

A fund was made in 2005 in honour of Nadia Younes, under which a conference and meeting room for the support of the Model United Nations was created.

This has led to the expansion of the model from modelling only one UN council to seven:Makary, Adam Daily News Egypt - CAIRO MODEL UN INAUGURATES ITS 19TH SESSION the Security Council, HRC, ICJ, ECOSOC, International Criminal Court, CTC, and UN Women. In 2010, CIMUN won the Outstanding Delegation Award while at the National Model United Nations Conference in New York. While this is the second time the group has won the award, this time is considered more important because the group was representing their own country, Egypt.

Condensed DNA often has surprising properties, which one would not predict from classical concepts of dilute solutions. Therefore, DNA condensation in vitro serves as a model system for many processes of physics, biochemistry and biology. In addition, DNA condensation has many potential applications in medicine and biotechnology. DNA diameter is about 2 nm, while the length of a stretched single molecule may be up to several dozens of centimetres depending on the organism. Many features of the DNA double helix contribute to its large stiffness, including the mechanical properties of the sugar-phosphate backbone, electrostatic repulsion between phosphates (DNA bears on average one elementary negative charge per each 0.17 nm of the double helix), stacking interactions between the bases of each individual strand, and strand-strand interactions. DNA is one of the stiffest natural polymers, yet it is also one of the longest molecules. This means that at large distances DNA can be considered as a flexible rope, and on a short scale as a stiff rod. Like a garden hose, unpacked DNA would randomly occupy a much larger volume than when it is orderly packed. Mathematically, for a non-interacting flexible chain randomly diffusing in 3D, the end-to-end distance would scale as a square root of the polymer length. For real polymers such as DNA, this gives only a very rough estimate; what is important, is that the space available for the DNA in vivo is much smaller than the space that it would occupy in the case of a free diffusion in the solution. To cope with volume constraints, DNA can pack itself in the appropriate solution conditions with the help of ions and other molecules. Usually, DNA condensation is defined as \\"the collapse of extended DNA chains into compact, orderly particles containing only one or a few molecules\\". This definition applies to many situations in vitro and is also close to the definition of DNA condensation in bacteria as \\"adoption of relatively concentrated, compact state occupying a fraction of the volume available\\". In eukaryotes, the DNA size and the number of other participating players are much larger, and a DNA molecule forms millions of ordered nucleoprotein particles, the nucleosomes, which is just the first of many levels of DNA packing.  In life  = In viruses = In viruses and bacteriophages, the DNA or RNA is surrounded by a protein capsid, sometimes further enveloped by a lipid membrane. Double-stranded DNA is stored inside the capsid in the form of a spool, which can have different types of coiling leading to different types of liquid-crystalline packing. This packing can change from hexagonal to cholesteric to isotropic at different stages of the phage functioning. Although the double helices are always locally aligned, the DNA inside viruses does not represent real liquid crystals, because it lacks fluidity. On the other hand, DNA condensed in vitro, e.g., with the help of polyamines also present in viruses, is both locally ordered and fluid. = In bacteria = Basic units of genomic organization in bacteria and eukaryotes. Bacterial DNA is packed with the help of polyamines and proteins called nucleoid-associated proteins. Protein-associated DNA occupies about 1/4 of the intracellular volume forming a concentrated viscous phase with liquid crystalline properties, called the nucleoid. Similar DNA packaging exists also in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Bacterial DNA is sometimes referred to as the bacterial chromosome. Bacterial nucleoid evolutionary represents an intermediate engineering solution between the protein-free DNA packing in viruses and protein-determined packing in eukaryotes. Sister chromosomes in the bacterium Escherichia coli are induced by stressful conditions to condense and undergo pairing. Stress-induced condensation occurs by a non-random, zipper-like convergence of sister chromosomes. This convergence appears to depend on the ability of identical double-stranded DNA molecules to specifically identify each other, a process that culminates in the proximity of homologous sites along the paired chromosomes. Diverse stress conditions appear to prime bacteria to effectively cope with severe DNA damages such as double-strand breaks. The apposition of homologous sites associated with stress-induced chromosome condensation helps explain how repair of double- strand breaks and other damages occurs. = In eukaryotes = Different levels of DNA condensation in eukaryotes. (1) Single DNA strand. (2) Chromatin strand (DNA with histones). (3) Chromatin during interphase with centromere. (4) Two copies of condensed chromatin together during prophase. (5) Chromosome during metaphase. Eukaryotic DNA with a typical length of dozens of centimeters should be orderly packed to be readily accessible inside the micrometer-size nucleus. In most eukaryotes, DNA is arranged in the cell nucleus with the help of histones. In this case, the basic level of DNA compaction is the nucleosome, where the double helix is wrapped around the histone octamer containing two copies of each histone H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Linker histone H1 binds the DNA between nucleosomes and facilitates packaging of the 10 nm \\"beads on the string\\" nucleosomal chain into a more condensed 30 nm fiber. Most of the time, between cell divisions, chromatin is optimized to allow easy access of transcription factors to active genes, which are characterized by a less compact structure called euchromatin, and to alleviate protein access in more tightly packed regions called heterochromatin. During the cell division, chromatin compaction increases even more to form chromosomes, which can cope with large mechanical forces dragging them into each of the two daughter cells. Many aspects of transcription are controlled by chemical modification on the histone proteins, known as the histone code. Chromosome scaffold has important role to hold the chromatin into compact chromosome. Chromosome scaffold is made of proteins including condensin, topoisomerase IIŒ± and kinesin family member 4 (KIF4) Chromosome Scaffold is a Double-Stranded Assembly of Scaffold Proteins, by Poonperm et al, Nature scientific reports Dinoflagellates are very divergent eukaryotes in terms of how they package their DNA. Their chromosomes are packed in a liquid-crystalline state. They have lost many of the conserved histone genes, using mostly dinoflagellate viral nucleoproteins (DVNPs) or bacteria-derived dinoflagellate histone-like proteins (HLPs) for packaging instead. It is unknown how they control access to genes; those do retain histone have a special histone code. = In archaea = Depending on the organism, an archaeon may use a bacteria-like HU system or an eukaryote-like nucleosome system for packaging.  In vitro  DNA condensation can be induced in vitro either by applying external force to bring the double helices together, or by inducing attractive interactions between the DNA segments. The former can be achieved e.g. with the help of the osmotic pressure exerted by crowding neutral polymers in the presence of monovalent salts. In this case, the forces pushing the double helices together are coming from entropic random collisions with the crowding polymers surrounding DNA condensates, and salt is required to neutralize DNA charges and decrease DNA-DNA repulsion. The second possibility can be realized by inducing attractive interactions between the DNA segments by multivalent cationic charged ligands (multivalent metal ions, inorganic cations, polyamines, protamines, peptides, lipids, liposomes and proteins).  Physics  Condensation of long double-helical DNAs is a sharp phase transition, which takes place within a narrow interval of condensing agent concentrations.[ref] Since the double helices come very closely to each other in the condensed phase, this leads to the restructuring of water molecules, which gives rise to the so-called hydration forces.[ref] To understand attraction between negatively charged DNA molecules, one also must account for correlations between counterions in the solution.[ref] DNA condensation by proteins can exhibit hysteresis, which can be explained using a modified Ising model.  Role in gene regulation  Nowadays descriptions of gene regulation are based on the approximations of equilibrium binding in dilute solutions, although it is clear that these assumptions are in fact violated in chromatin. The dilute- solution approximation is violated for two reasons. First, the chromatin content is far from being dilute, and second, the numbers of the participating molecules are sometimes so small, that it does not make sense to talk about the bulk concentrations. Further differences from dilute solutions arise due to the different binding affinities of proteins to condensed and uncondensed DNA. Thus in condensed DNA both the reaction rates can be changed and their dependence on the concentrations of reactants may become nonlinear.

UAS depends on the USB protocol, and uses the standard SCSI command set. Use of UAS generally provides faster transfers compared to the older USB Mass Storage Bulk-Only Transport (BOT) drivers. UAS was introduced as part of the USB 3.0 standard, but can also be used with devices complying with the slower USB 2.0 standard, assuming use of compatible hardware, firmware and drivers.  Overview  UAS is defined across two standards, the T10 \\"USB Attached SCSI\\" (T10/2095-D) referred to as the \\"UAS\\" specification, and the USB \\"Universal Serial Bus Mass Storage Class - USB Attached SCSI Protocol (UASP)\\" specification. The T10 technical committee of the International Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) develops and maintains the UAS specification; the SCSI Trade Association (SCSITA) promotes the UAS technology. The USB mass-storage device class (MSC) Working Group develops and maintains the UASP specification; the USB Implementers Forum, Inc. (USB-IF) promotes the UASP technology. UAS drivers generally provide faster transfers when compared to the older USB Mass Storage Bulk-Only Transport (BOT) protocol drivers. Although UAS was added in the USB 3.0 standard, it can also be used at USB 2.0 speeds, assuming compatible hardware. When used with an SSD, UAS is considerably faster than BOT for random reads and writes, but still well below the speed of a native SATA 3 interface (6 Gbit/s).  Hardware support  A brief hardware roundup in July 2010 by SemiAccurate found that Gigabyte Technology had introduced working UAS drivers for their boards using NEC/Renesas chips, and that‚Äîon the hardware level at least‚Äî\\"the LucidPort USB 300 and USB302, Symwave SW6315, Texas Instruments TUSB9260 and the VLI VL700 controllers all support UASP, while as far as we could find, the ASMedia ASM1051 and ASM1051E as well as the Fujitsu MB86C30A doesn‚Äôt.\\" A comparative performance review by VR-Zone in August 2011, concluded that only the NEC/Renesas chips had UAS working drivers. The same Renesas UAS driver (for Windows) also works with AMD's A70M and A75 Fusion Controller Hubs, the USB part of which was co-developed by AMD and Renesas. In October 2011, ASMedia chips had gained driver support as well (they had support on the hardware side before). Fujitsu lists some higher-end chips like the MB86C311A that do support UAS. As for support by Intel Platform Controller Hub (PCH), an article in MyCE notes: \\"The native Intel USB3 UASP solution is only supported under Windows 8. To further complicate matters, not all Z77 motherboards support USB3 UASP. A license is required to implement UASP, and not all motherboard manufacturers are prepared to pass on the extra cost of this license to the end user.\\"  Operating system support  Microsoft added native support for UAS to Windows 8. Drives supporting UAS load Uaspstor.sys instead of the older Usbstor.sys. Windows 8 supports UAS by default over USB 2.0 as well.USB Attached SCSI (UAS) Best Practices for Windows 8, page 6 UAS drivers and products are certified by Microsoft using the Windows Hardware Certification Kit. Apple added native support for UAS to OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion; drives using UAS show up in (Apple menu -> About This Mac) -> System Information -> Software -> Extensions as IOUSBAttachedSCSI (or IOUSBMassStorageUASDriver, depending on the version of OS X) \\"Loaded: Yes\\". Drives listed with \\"Loaded: No\\" are defaulting the older, slower Bulk Only Transport (BOT) mode. This may occur if the drive's USB controller, the Mac's USB port, or any attached USB hub doesn't support UASP mode. Linux kernel has been supporting UAS since 8 June 2014 when the version 3.15 was released. However, some distributions of Linux such as Ubuntu (from v11.xx onwards) have suffered from issues with the implementation of the UAS protocol. In some non-UAS supported USB HDD drives, the drive is not mountable by the operating system. A reported workaround is to blacklist the UAS module in modprobe.

He is primarily recognized for creating and popularizing contemporary versions of 19th-century Jewish cantorial music. He is the father of Samuel Adler, a prominent American composer of contemporary classical music.  Personal life  Hugo Chaim Adler was born in Antwerp, Belgium, while his Jewish-German parents were on holiday on January 17, 1894. He was one of eight sons born to his parents, Emma Dahl and Simon Adler. Raised in Mannheim, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, he studied music composition at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln from 1912-1915. In 1915 he was drafted into the German Army as an infantryman and was injured at the Argonne in 1918. All seven of his brothers served in the war, and all survived. After returning home, Adler began his tenure at the Haupt-Synagogue in Mannheim and met his wife Selma Rothschild. They had two children, Marianne and Samuel Adler. He participated in the Mannheim Holiday Choir and was a member of the local Liederkranz. On Kristallnacht in 1938, the Haupt-Synagogue and Adler's final German cantata ‚ÄúAkedah‚Äù were destroyed in the firebombing. That December, he was imprisoned for two months in The Netherlands due to his Jewish ancestry. Upon his release in the spring of 1939, the family emigrated to New York City and settled in Worcester, Massachusetts, up to and including his American citizenship being approved in 1946. Adler worked as a cantor, conductor and music educator in Worcester until he was diagnosed with cancer and died in December 1955.  Educational and Professional Career  Adler studied music composition and Jewish teacher training at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik K√∂ln from 1912-1915, and studied music composition with Ernst Toch at the Mannheim Conservatory from 1924-1926. After a brief tenure as cantor in the town of St. Wendel in the Saarlands from 1918-1921, Adler became chief cantor at the Haupt-Synagogue in Mannheim, Germany from 1921-1938. He taught educational courses and lectured other local Jewish educators and composers during this time, as well as his cantorial duties. For his efforts, he was awarded in 1937 by the Reichs Jewish Cultural Association for his work with mixed a capella music. After emigrating to the United States, he became the head cantor of Temple Emanuel in Worcester, Massachusetts in March 1939. He helped organize the Worcester Annual Jewish Music Festival from 1940-1954. Adler sat on the New York Hebrew Union College and School of Sacred Music's advisory boards, and worked for the Zionist Organization of America. In 1942, he was awarded the first prize by the Central Conference of American Rabbis for his liturgical work. His works were published by Transcontinental Music Publishers and Sacred Music Press, two of the largest Jewish-American music publishers. Adler's music is still taught and performed in American and Israeli synagogues, primarily the Shabbat prayers ‚ÄúNachalath Israel,‚Äù ‚ÄúKaddish,‚Äù and his cantatas ‚ÄúJonah‚Äù and ‚ÄúBearers of Light.‚Äù References Category:1894 births Category:1955 deaths Category:Hazzans Category:Jewish composers Category:Belgian composers Category:Male composers Category:Belgian conductors (music) Category:Belgian male musicians Category:Male conductors (music) Category:Cologne University of Music alumni Category:German emigrants to the United States Category:Belgian Jews Category:German Jews Category:German people of Belgian descent Category:American people of Belgian-Jewish descent Category:People from Antwerp Category:20th-century conductors (music) Category:20th-century composers Category:20th-century singers Category:20th- century male musicians ","title":"Hugo Chaim Adler"},{"id":"28268789","text":"Blacklight is the fourth studio album by Iris, released on September 3, 2010.

The building is part of the University City Plaza, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 7, 1975. Application for NRHP listing, April 1975  History  The current University City City Hall building was built by magazine publisher and businessman Edward Gardner Lewis, a native of Connecticut who came to St. Louis, Missouri, in the late 1890s, selling insect extermination products and medicines that were said to be highly questionable. He bought a magazine called Winner, based in downtown St. Louis, which he renamed Woman's Magazine and quickly built its circulation to the largest in the country, amassing a fortune in the process. In 1902, Lewis purchased 85 acres (344,000 m¬≤) several miles west of downtown St. Louis. The tract, located near the construction site of the World's Fair, would become the nucleus for the streetcar suburb of University City. In 1903, with his publishing operation outgrowing its downtown location, Lewis began the construction of a new Lewis Publishing Company headquarters and Press Annex at this site. After incorporating University City in 1906, he served three terms as mayor. During this time, he built the Woman's Magazine Building, an Egyptian temple and an Art Academy. But Lewis' financial empire in Missouri collapsed amid charges of mail fraud, bankruptcy, and litigation, and by 1915, he had moved his base of operations to Atascadero, California. Lewis declared bankruptcy a second time in 1924. The Magazine Building briefly sat vacant, until it was dedicated as the new city hall on November 1, 1930.  Carbon arc searchlight  For the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair, Lewis had the world's largest carbon arc searchlight installed atop the dome, 135 feet above street level. An eight-ton, 80-inch light built by General Electric in 1903, the searchlight developed at least 1 billion candlepower. The searchlight has a seven-foot carbon arc that is ‚Äúignited by carbon rods and reflected in a ground glass mirror that magnifies the light.‚Äù The building elevator was too small to hold the light; its installation on the roof required a steam engine borrowed from the World's Fair. It sits on an elevator platform that raises the light through a hatch in the roof; today it is accessed via a spiral staircase in the council chambers. It was first illuminated on April 30, 1904, opening night of the World's Fair, to illuminate and advertise Lewis's tent city next to the Woman's Magazine Building. After the Fair, the light sat unused until it was restored in 1930 for the dedication of the City Hall. It was used again for the dedication of the University City Public Library and then was neglected until it was restored and operated by City Engineer Robert Norvell in the mid-1960s. It was relit on May 10, 1965, by then-Mayor Nathan B. Kaufman and has been maintained and operated by his son, Bill Kaufman, from 1972 to the present.  Architecture  The octagonal, five-story brick-and-limestone building was built in a Beaux-Arts style with a dome roof. It was designed by Herbert C. Chivers (1869‚Äì1946), a local architect who had helped draft plans for St. Louis' Union Station. Its landscaping was done in 1907 by landscape architect George E. Kessler. The building features a marble staircase connecting the first and second floors, a central rotunda and a large domed room on the top floor that serves as the council chambers. Among the architectural details that have been removed from the building are terra cotta cherubs along its roof line and a tunnel connecting it to the much larger Egyptian Building, now destroyed.  Renovation  Though structurally sound, the exterior of the building displayed signs of wear and tear by the turn of the millennium. The building underwent refurbishment in the mid-2000s, funded by a $2.9 billion bond measure passed in 2004. The project, led by Architect Trivers Associates, brought the building into compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and led to LEED certification. To achieve LEED certification, a new HVAC system and water saving measures were installed. The renovations also included exterior tuckpointing and the replacement of the windows and historic restoration of the original wooden window sashes.

The throat is white and has a few brown spots. The belly is immaculate whitish, but some individuals have a few brown spots. Habitat and conservation Cycloramphus faustoi are known from a small valley in a dry stream bed at elevations of above sea level. The stream is bordered by Atlantic forest. During the rainy season, the water trickles through this valley. Both males and females were spotted in rock crevices; they were wary and went into hiding when disturbed. Reproduction seems to occur in August when, following a rainy afternoon, males were heard calling at night and a females found guarding an egg clutch consisting of 31 eggs; the female did not leave even when disturbed. This species appears to be scarce within its small range. Moreover, its habitat is threatened by fires caused by artillery training activities.

It occurred during an extended period of strong geomagnetic activity in solar cycle 12. The event is particularly remembered in connection with an unusual phenomenon, an \\"auroral beam\\", which was observed from the Royal Observatory, Greenwich by astronomer Edward Walter Maunder and by John Rand Capron from Guildown, Surrey. Magnetic effects The magnetic storm that caused the brilliant auroral display of November 1882 was reported in The New York Times and other newspapers as having an effect on telegraph systems, which were rendered useless in some cases.The Transit of Venus storm, solarstorms.org The Savannah Morning News reported that \\"the switchboard at the Chicago Western Union office was set on fire several times, and much damage to equipment was done. From Milwaukee, the 'volunteer electric current' was at one time strong enough to light up an electric lamp\\". Measurements taken in the United Kingdom, where the telegraph also was affected, indicated that a telluric current five times stronger than normal was present.Angot, A. The Aurora Borealis, London: R. Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co, 1896, p.143 Aurorae =Polar observations= During the event, bright auroral phenomena were recorded from across the world, including several observations from polar latitudes, thanks to the event occurring during the First International Polar Year. In one case, two members of the ill-fated Lady Franklin Bay Expedition, including the astronomer, Edward Israel, while observing at Fort Conger near the north magnetic pole, instinctively ducked to avoid an aurora described as \\"as bright as the full moon\\".Silverman and Tuan in Landsberg, E.H.

Note that Thomson gives the date as April 1883, but in a subsequent \\"correction\\" (3, 1917, 222) identifies it as November 17, 1882 after receiving further information from Alexander McAdie. =Capron's beam= The Observatory, June 1883 (pp. 192-193) and April 1916 (pp. 213-215), which he termed \\"a strange celestial visitor,\\" the drawing above is by astronomer and aurora expert, John Rand Capron of Guildown Observatory, Surrey, United Kingdom, who also observed it and the crescent moon is represented below it to the right \\\\- Philosophical Magazine, May 1883 The most unusual phenomenon of the auroral storm, witnessed from Europe at approximately 6 p.m. on November 17, was described in detail in various ways, including as a \\"beam\\", \\"spindle\\", \\"definite body\\" with a \\"Zeppelin\\"-like shape and pale green colour, passing from horizon to horizon above the Moon.See Maunder, E. W. A Strange Celestial Visitor, in The Observatory, April 1916, 213-215 The phenomenon, which transited the sky in approximately seventy-five seconds, was witnessed and documented by the amateur scientist and astronomer, John Rand Capron, at Guildown, Surrey. Capron made a drawing of what he referred to as the \\"auroral beam\\"; it subsequently was published along with an article in the Philosophical Magazine. In the article, Capron collected twenty-six separate accounts, of which the majority came from the United Kingdom: these included reports of the object's torpedo-shaped appearance and an apparent dark nucleus. Several of Capron's correspondents speculated that the phenomenon might have been a meteor, but Capron (and Maunder, who wrote a note in The Observatory on Capron's study) thought it could have represented a transient illumination of an otherwise invisible auroral arc.Maunder, 1883, 193 The writer, Charles Hoy Fort, later referred to this incident in his book The Book of the Damned, in which he collected further reports from various articles (including several in the journal Nature) published both at the time and subsequently: > In the London Times, Nov. 20, 1882, the Editor says that he had received a > great number of letters upon this phenomenon. He publishes two. One > correspondent describes it as \\"well-defined and shaped like a fish ‚Ä¶ > extraordinary and alarming.\\" The other correspondent writes of it as \\"a most > magnificent luminous mass, shaped somewhat like a torpedo.\\"Fort, C. H. The > Book of the Damned, pp. 293-294 Although Fort suggested the event had supernatural overtones, scientific opinion was that the \\"beam\\" likely represented an extremely unusual auroral phenomenon. Maunder commented: > This \\"torpedo-shaped\\" beam of light was quite unlike any other celestial > object that I have ever seen. The quality of its light, and its occurrence > while a great magnetic storm and a bright aurora were in progress, seem to > establish its auroral origin. But it differed very widely in appearance from > any other aurora that I have ever seen.Maunder, 1916, 214 Solar phenomena In a 1904 article, Maunder was to describe the storm as a \\"very intense and long-continued disturbance\\", which in total, lasted between November 11 and 26. He pointed out that this synchronised \\"with the entire passage across the visible disc\\" of sunspot group 885 (Greenwich numbering).Maunder, E. The \\"Great\\" Magnetic Storms, 1875 to 1903, and their association with Sun-spots, as recorded at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, MNRAS, LXIV, 3, (Jan 1904), 206 This group originally had formed on the disc on October 20, passed off at the west limb on October 28, passed again east- west between November 12‚Äì25, and returned at the east limb on December 10, before finally disappearing on the disc on December 20.Maunder, 1904, 216 The association of the November 1882 sunspot, or group of sunspots, with the strong auroral display, the collapse of the telegraph system, and variations in the magnetic readings taken at Greenwich was to prompt Maunder to pursue further research of the link between sunspots and magnetic phenomena.Clark, S.

The specific name perere (from Portuguese perer√™) is derived from a character in Indian folklore who guards the forest, disrupting its silence with its whistles‚Äîin reference to the vocalizations of this species. Description Males measure and females in snout‚Äìvent length. The snout is truncated in both dorsal and lateral views. The dorsum and dorsal portions of thighs are light olive-brown with dark blotches. There are dark stripes in the thighs. Males are territorial and call in forest-covered stretches of streams, perched on rocks, branches, stream marginss, or partly submerged in the water. They both day and night; this is unusual as other Hylodes species call by daytime only. Habitat The species has been collected by small streams at elevations of above sea level in a hilly area covered by seasonal semideciduous forests and dense montane forests.

Early life He was the son of Colonel Archibald Neil Campbell of Craignish and was educated at Charterhouse School,s: List of Carthusians, 1800‚Äì1879/C. from where he won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, gaining a first-class degree in classics. He was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn in 1890, and was one of His Majesty's Inspector of Schools from 1892 to 1909. He worked for two or three years as educational adviser to King Chulalongkorn of Siam, writing a book Siam in the Twentieth Century (1902). Parliamentary career A strong unionist and tariff reformer, Campbell first stood for Parliament at the January 1910 general election, when he was unsuccessful in the Mansfield division of Nottinghamshire, which was then a safe seat for the Liberal Party. He contested the December 1910 election in the more-winnable Eccles division of Lancashire, but failed to oust the sitting Liberal MP Sir George Pollard.Craig, British parliamentary election results 1832‚Äì1885, page 316 He won a seat on his third attempt, when he was elected at the 1918 general election as the Coalition Unionist MP for the safe seat of Kingston- upon-Thames, replacing the Home Secretary George Cave who had been ennobled as Viscount Cave. In August 1921, Campbell was one of 31 Unionist MPs dissatisfied with the Liberal-led Coalition Government who signed a manifesto pledging that after the next election they would hold themselves independent of any of the political parties on matters concerning the economy and finance. By late 1922, Unionist discontent at the coalition led to a meeting at the Carlton Club in October 1922 where the Unionists decided to withdraw from the coalition. The collapse of the government triggered the 1922 general election, when Campbell stood down from the House of Commons, due to ill-health.

As a Resident Orchestra at the Southbank Centre, the first Night Shift took place on 22 May 2006 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall. Since then there have been fifteen further concerts at venues including the Queen Elizabeth Hall, Royal Festival Hall, The Roundhouse and the Corn Exchange, Brighton Dome. The Night Shift aims to \\"present classical music in a new way to attract an audience that rarely or never attends classical music\\". It is characterised by its lack of formalities traditionally associated with classical music and key features include the following: * Pre and post concert entertainment such as DJs, Folk and Jazz groups, VJs and dance * Drinks promotions and drinks allowed in the concert hall, * A relaxed atmosphere in the concert hall; the audience is encouraged to move, talk and clap as they wish. * The concert is presented from the stage and includes interviews with performers and questions from the audience. Ticket prices are kept low, typically ¬£8 in advance, ¬£12 on the door and ¬£4 for students. To date there have been over 7500 attendances at Night Shift events, with a peak audience of 1,200 at The Roundhouse on 29 January 2010, where Vladimir Jurowski conducted Beethoven‚Äôs Coriolan Overture and Symphony No. 7. The one-hour concert was presented by Alistair Appleton, accompanied by live video projections. Other artists to have appeared at The Night Shift include Robin Ticciati, Marin Alsop, Rachel Podger, Edward Gardner, Christian Tetzlaff, Eduardo Portal, Stephen Hough and Yannick N√©zet-S√©guin. On 13 August The Night Shift will be debuting at Wilton‚Äôs Music Hall in London‚Äôs East End, performing a programme of Handel and Purcell, played on seventeenth-century instruments, with a support show from Nathan ‚ÄòFlutebox‚Äô Lee, the beatboxing flute player. In January 2010, independent research into The Night Shift was produced which revealed a number of trends. All Night Shift surveys showed a high proportion of 25- to 34-year-olds, followed by 19- to 24-year-olds and 35- to 44-year-olds, with few attendees over the age of 45, and approximately 30-40% of ticket sales attributed to students. Major motivating factors included competitive ticket pricing, informal atmosphere and the influence of friends. The research gave the following conclusion: > In short, The Night Shift is cool. The Night Shift succeeds in reversing all > negative preconceptions of live classical music concerts: in the course of > an hour or so attendees moved from expectations that the experience will be > expensive, formal, long, middle aged, proper, strict and stuffy to an > understanding that it can be accessible, comfortable, inclusive, informal, > laid back, relaxing, spontaneous and studenty. The OAE is doing a service to > the entire sector. Another piece of independent research published in August 2010 highlighted the effectiveness of the use of embedded information in The Night Shift concert format. It found that the use of audience participation, verbal introductions, explanations from the stage and demonstrations of different ways of playing the same passage of music all helped create a more inclusive atmosphere and build a rapport with audience members, particularly those relatively unfamiliar with classical music.

Historian suggested that Sang Rama Samadya probably was once an important ksatrya (knight), a palace courtier or official in Majapahit court that defeated in the court politics and lost the favour of the king.

Escape from Dartmoor) is a 1929 British silent film, directed by Anthony Asquith and starring Norah Baring, Uno Henning and Hans Adalbert Schlettow. The cameraman was Stanley Rodwell. It was the last of Asquith's four silent films, produced exactly on the cusp of the transition from silents to talkies in British cinema, a point which is referenced in the film itself. Plot Joe (Henning) works as a barber in a shop in a Devon town, alongside a manicurist called Sally (Baring). He becomes infatuated with her and asks her out on a date; however the evening turns out awkwardly and it is clear that Sally does not reciprocate Joe's feelings. Despite Sally's lack of interest and through a misunderstanding involving a floral buttonhole, Joe's infatuation with her develops into obsession. Meanwhile, a regular client at the salon, young gentleman farmer Harry (Schlettow), begins to woo Sally, who is much more receptive to his attentions. The couple begin seeing each other, and one evening arrange to go to the local cinema. Unknown to them they are stalked by the jealous and overwrought Joe, who sits behind them and is forced to witness their obvious happiness together, eventually rushing out of the cinema in despair. The following day Harry comes into the shop for his regular shave and manicure, and Joe notices that Sally is wearing an engagement ring. A verbal confrontation between Joe and Harry escalates into a physical struggle, during which Harry is slashed by Joe's cut-throat razor. Sally is convinced that Joe had deliberately tried to kill his rival, and following his arrest and trial Joe is convicted of attempted murder. Vowing revenge on Sally and Harry, he is sentenced to a lengthy term of incarceration at the notorious Dartmoor Prison. Some years later, Joe succeeds in escaping from the prison, and makes his way across the bleak Dartmoor landscape towards the isolated cottage where Sally and Harry, since married and with a young son, now live. At night he surprises Sally outside her home where she, now feeling remorseful about her role in his imprisonment, takes pity on him and offers him a hiding place. Harry returns, and there follows an awkward but genuine reconciliation between Harry and Joe, climaxing with Harry's decision to assist Joe's escape. However, on the point of escape, Joe abandons the enterprise and initiates a rush to the cottage that he knows will draw attention and lead to his death. The guards posted at the farm shoot him, and he dies in Sally's arms. Cast * Norah Baring as Sally * Uno Henning as Joe * Hans Adalbert Schlettow as Harry Production Dartmoor locations were used for exterior filming, while interior work was shot at Welwyn Studios near London. The three main actors were English (Baring), Swedish (Henning) and German (Schlettow). It was the only British film for Henning and Schlettow. A Cottage on Dartmoor uses flashback technique, opening with Joe's flight from prison before going back to reveal the core events which led to him being there. The action finally returns to the present and Joe's death, framing the historical with the current. The central cinema sequence in the film is noted for its reflection of the seminal transitional period in cinema history when the advent of talkies was revolutionising the industry but silent and talkie films still existed side by side. The first film on the bill at the cinema is a silent comedy, with full orchestral accompaniment, and the audience are shown laughing uproariously. When the main talkie feature begins, however, the audience falls into a state of stunned, emotionless silence. This has been interpreted as Asquith's own comment on the phenomenon. Writing in The New York Times in 2007, critic Dave Kehr surmised that \\"many filmmakers, Asquith apparently included, believed that silent storytelling had reached such a high level of refinement that mere chatter would never be enough to extinguish it.\\" Reputation A Cottage on Dartmoor was released on DVD by Kino Films in the US in 2007, and in the UK by the British Film Institute in 2008, and was very positively received by critics. Simon McCallum wrote, \\"A straightforward but beautifully realised tale of sexual jealousy, the film easily counters the entrenched criticism that British cinema in the silent era was staid, stagy and lacking emotion\\" and \\" (it) is perhaps most rewardingly viewed as a final, passionate cry in defence of the silent aesthetic in British cinema.\\"A Cottage on Dartmoor (1929)\\" McCallum, Simon. BFI Screen Online. Retrieved 05-08-2010 Kehr noted that the film \\"(suggests) that there was more to the British silent cinema than the youthful works of Alfred Hitchcock\\" and that it \\"provides ample illustration of how elegantly and assuredly expressive silent film had become, and how hard it must have been to believe that this magnificent medium, then just over 30 years old, was doomed.\\" References  External links   Category:1929 films Category:1929 drama films Category:British films Category:British silent feature films Category:British drama films Category:British black-and-white films Category:Films set in Devon Category:Films directed by Anthony Asquith ","title":"A Cottage on Dartmoor"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},B={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,o,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your libraryü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",B,[(t(!0),n(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),b(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(P,[["render",R]]),E=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/40.md","filePath":"people/40.md"}'),D={name:"people/40.md"},L=Object.assign(D,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(t(),n("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{E as __pageData,L as default};
