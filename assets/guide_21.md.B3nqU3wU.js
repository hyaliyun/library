She is a member of the Haisla and Heiltsuk First Nations.Eden Robinson's entry in The Canadian Encyclopedia. Life =Childhood= Born in Kitamaat, British Columbia, she is a member of the Haisla and Heiltsuk First Nations. Her sister, Carla Robinson, is a television journalist for CBC Newsworld. =Education= She received a BA from the University of Victoria and an MFA from the University of British Columbia. = Later life = In 2003, Robinson moved back to Kitamaat Village to care for her father who had been diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 1998. In 2019, Robinson was diagnosed with polymyalgia rheumatica. Literary works Robinson's first book, Traplines (1995), was a collection of four short stories. The young narrators recount haunting tales of their disturbing relationships with sociopaths and psychopaths. The collection won Britain's Winifred Holtby Memorial Prize for the best regional work by a Commonwealth writer. One of the stories, \\"Queen of the North\\", was also published in The Penguin Anthology of Stories by Canadian Women. Another of her short stories, \\"Terminal Avenue\\", (which was not included in Traplines) was published in the anthology of postcolonial science fiction and fantasy So Long Been Dreaming. Her second book, Monkey Beach (2000), is a novel. It is set in Kitamaat territory and follows a teenage girl's search for answers to and understanding of her younger brother's disappearance at sea while in the retrospective, it tells a story about growing up on a Haisla reserve. The book is both a mystery and a spiritual journey, combining contemporary realism with Haisla mysticism. Monkey Beach was shortlisted for the Scotiabank Giller Prize and the Governor General's Literary Award, and received the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize. In her third book, Blood Sports (2006), also a novel, Robinson returns to the characters and urban terrain of her novella \\"Contact Sports,\\" from Traplines. Her novel Son of a Trickster (2017) is a humorous coming of age novel and the first of a trilogy. It took Robinson eight years to write, and was originally conceived as a short story. The second book in the trilogy is Trickster Drift (2018), which follows the main character from Kitamaat to Vancouver. The third book in the trilogy will be titled The Return of the Trickster or The Trickster Returns. Son of a Trickster was optioned for a television series, premiering as Trickster on CBC Television in 2020. Awards and honours She won the Ethel Wilson Fiction Prize in 2001 for Monkey Beach, and the Writers' Trust Engel/Findley Award in 2016 for her body of work.\\"Eden Robinson, Gregory Scofield, Yasuko Thanh among 2016 Writers' Trust Prize winners\\".

This was a revolutionary invention in the automotive industry, allowing wheels to react to irregularities of road surfaces independently, and enable the vehicle to maintain a strong road holding. The first automotive application was the Rumpler Tropfenwagen, later followed by the Mercedes 130H/150H/170H, the Standard Superior, the Volkswagen Beetle and its derivatives, and the Chevrolet Corvair, amongst others. Some later automobile rear swing axles have universal joints connecting the driveshafts to the differential, which is attached to the chassis. Swing axles do not have universal joints at the wheels‚Äîthe wheels are always perpendicular to the driveshafts; the design is therefore not suitable for a car's front wheels, which require steering motion. Swing axle suspensions conventionally used leaf springs and shock absorbers. It was also used in early aircraft (1910 or before), such as the Sopwith and Fokker, usually with rubber bungee and no damping. suspension characteristics: Camber change on bumps, \\"jacking\\" on rebound Comparison =Advantage= The swing axle suspension has two advantages over the typical live axle: # It reduced unsprung weight since the differential is mounted to the chassis # It eliminates sympathetic camber changes on opposite wheels =Shortcomings= # A great amount of single-wheel camber change is experienced relative to beam axle designs, since the radius of the jointed half-shaft is less than half that of the whole axle assembly. # \\"Jacking\\" on suspension unloading (or rebound) causes positive camber changes on both sides, which (In extreme cases) can overturn the car. # Change in camber due to cornering forces can cause loss of rear-wheel adhesion leading to oversteer‚Äîa dynamically unstable condition that can cause a vehicle to spin. This is an especially severe problem when a swing axle is used in a rear-engine design, because of the greater side-g forces on the rear wheels from the mass of the engine. Camber changes during deceleration can increase the severity of lift-off oversteer. 1964 Corvair swing-axle rear suspension with transverse leaf spring =Solutions= Several engineering options can limit swing axle handling problems, with varying success: # Anti-roll bar: As a design option, a front anti-roll bar which can ameliorate the swing axle car's handling‚Äîshifting weight transfer to the front outboard tyre, considerably reducing rear slip angles‚Äîthereby avoiding potential oversteer. # Single-pivot point: Mercedes-Benz addressed the handling issues by producing swing axles with a single-pivot point located under the differential, thus well below the axle. This configuration markedly reduced the tendency to \\"jack-up\\" and the later low pivot swing-axle equipped cars were praised in contemporary publications for their handling. The low-pivot swing-axle remained in production with Mercedes-Benz W108 280SE and 300SEL until 1972. It was fitted to the 300SEL 6.3, which was during the early 1970s the world's fastest production sedan. AMG-modified 6.3s were also raced with the stock swing axle. # Tyre pressure differential: The Renault Dauphine, Volkswagen Beetle and first generation Chevrolet Corvair (1960‚Äì1964) used a tyre pressure differential strategy to eliminate oversteer characteristics of their swing axle suspensions‚Äîspecifically low front and high rear tyre pressure‚Äîwhich induced understeer. The tyre pressure differential strategy offered a significant disadvantage: owners and mechanics could inadvertently but easily re-introduce oversteer characteristics by over-inflating the front tyres (that is, to typical pressures for other cars with other suspension systems) or by inflating all four tyres to the same pressure. The effectiveness of this option was criticized in lawsuits in the US during the 1960s. # Z-bar and roll-inducing springs: Mercedes-Benz introduced, to help their low-pivot swing-axle, a coil spring mounted transversely above the differential, which would transfer load from one side to the other, so as to force down one wheel when the other side went up. This coil spring increases the load bearing capacity of the rear suspension, so a new lower pressure set of springs was substituted for the usual ones to maintain ride suppleness. A similar effect was achieved by VW's Z-bar, as opposed to anti-roll bar. Both devices distribute the response of the rear axles to input on one wheel, thus reducing the tendency for excessive camber to occur on one wheel. These solutions represent a compromise between swing axle and beam axle characteristics, at the cost of decreasing ride quality. # Camber compensator: A transverse leaf spring is connected to the outer ends of the half-shafts and below the suspension assembly, resisting positive camber that could result from cornering forces or rebound. This was a successful solution introduced on the 1964 Corvair. Aftermarket camber compensators are available for Porsche, VW and early Corvairs. Safety Ralph Nader in his 1965 book Unsafe at Any Speed detailed accidents and lawsuits related to the shortcomings in 1960‚Äì1963 models of the first generation Chevrolet Corvair's swing-axle design. Nader identified a Chevrolet engineer who had fought management after the management had eliminated a front anti-roll bar for cost reasons. The 1964 models were fitted with a front anti-roll bar as standard equipment, in addition to a rear transverse leaf spring, thus improving stability during emergency maneuvering. Second-generation Corvairs (1965‚Äì1969) used a true independent rear suspension (IRS) system. The Hillman Imp designers learned from the problems with the Corvair, having crashedhttp://www.imps4ever.info/tech/suspense.html one at a relatively low speed, and they designed their rear-engined car with a semi- trailing arm suspension at the rear. To attain correct handling balance, they actually used swing-axle geometry at the front, with the steering pivots mounted at the outer ends of single swing wishbones. These caused too much understeer and uneven tyre wear, and modifications were made to reduce the positive camber of the front wheels by lowering the swing-axle pivot points.http://www.imps4ever.info/tech/suspension.html Aftermarket kits were also available to do this, and an inexpensive alternative was to insert a tapered shim to change the inclination of the kingpin carrier relative to the wishbone. Replacement Swing axles were supplanted in general use by de Dion tube axles in the late 1960s, though live axles remained the most common. Most rear suspensions have been replaced by more modern independent suspensions in recent years, and both swing and de Dion types are virtually unused today. One exception is the Czech truck manufacturer Tatra, which uses swing axles on a central 'backbone' tube since 1923 (model Tatra 11) instead of more common solid axles. This system is claimed to give greater rigidity and better performance on poor quality roads and off-road. There the inherent reduced stability on roads is compensated by an increased stability on rough terrain, allowing for higher off-road speeds, all else being equal. This is especially manifested in long 6+ wheel vehicles where offroad chassis twisting can be a major issue. Twin I-Beam Another use of the swing axle concept is Ford's \\"Twin I-Beam\\" front suspension for trucks. This system has solid axles, and may transmit power in four-wheel-drive versions, where it is called \\"Twin Traction Beam\\". Though it is an independent suspension system, as each tyre rises and falls without affecting the position of the other, the parallelogram action of the A-arm suspension system is not present. Each tyre moves in an arc, but, due to the longer arms, camber changes are proportionally smaller than in powered swing axles for the rear wheels listed above. The pivot point of the axles is lower and located not in the center of the car, but nearly on the opposite beam of the chassis, so the effect is far less hazardous.

Reruns continued on ABC until September 3, 1978. Premise Jabberjaw, a 15-foot air-breathing great white shark, is the drummer for The Neptunes, a rock group made up of four teenagers ‚Äî Biff, Shelly, Bubbles and Clamhead ‚Äî who live in an underwater civilization in the year 2076. Jabberjaw and The Neptunes travel to various underwater cities where they encounter and deal with assorted megalomaniacs and supervillains who want to conquer the undersea world. Like a great deal of Hanna-Barbera's 1970s output, the format and writing for Jabberjaw was similar to that for Scooby-Doo, Josie and the Pussycats and Speed Buggy. The show also drew inspiration (in the use of a shark as a character) from the overall shark mania of the mid-1970s caused by the then-recent film Jaws. It also shared The Flintstones' penchant for making use of puns as the names of locations, people, etc., in this case, ocean-themed puns (such as \\"Aqualaska\\" instead of Alaska). Every episode ended with a musical chase sequence where Jabberjaw and the gang would run from the villains, performing zany cartoon antics in order to escape while a song by The Neptunes played in the background. Characters Jabberjaw and The Neptunes. Counterclockwise: Jabberjaw (drums), Bubbles (keyboard), Biff (guitar), Shelly (tambourine) and Clamhead (bass). The series features the following five main characters throughout its run: * Frank Welker as Jabberjaw, an air-breathing, Brooklyn-accented anthropomorphic great white shark who impersonated Curly Howard of The Three Stooges. Jabberjaw found it hard to get respect in a society where \\"shark ejectors\\" (robots that would guard various buildings or cities against sharks being allowed to enter) were commonplace. These robots, as well as unpleasant treatment from others, frequently prompt him to utter some variation of his catchphrase (borrowed from the comedian Rodney Dangerfield): \\"I don't get no respect!\\" He has the unique ability to change his shape or adapt himself to act like various objects such as a trampoline, parachute, jack, throw rug, etc., either to get himself and the gang out of a jam, or just to hide. * Tommy Cook as Biff, an athletic, handsome, brown-haired young man who is the band's guitar player and level-headed leader who books all the gigs. In many episodes, his hair is drawn black. His main catchphrase is \\"Jumpin' jellyfish!\\" (occasionally, \\"Hoppin' halibut!\\") * Pat Parris as Shelly, a dark- haired young woman who plays tambourine and sings backup vocals for The Neptunes. She is attractive and intelligent, but haughty, vain and abrasive (like Josie and the Pussycats' Alexandra) and considers herself to be the star of the band. While she holds a great deal of disdain for Jabberjaw (or \\"Blubberhead\\" as she calls him), she does have some grudging fondness for him deep down and occasionally shows it. * Julie McWhirter as Bubbles, a young woman with blonde, curly hair who plays keyboard for The Neptunes. She is extremely ditzy and dimwitted, has a cute giggle, similar to Josie and the Pussycats' Melody. Shelly sometimes nicknames her \\"Ding-a-Ling\\" or \\"Bubblehead\\". Whenever she volunteers to help, she usually ends up messing it up. * Barry Gordon as Clamhead, a tall and slim, red-haired young man who plays bass for The Neptunes and is Jabberjaw's best friend. His catchphrases are crying out \\"Abba-abba-abba!\\" and \\"Wowee-wow-wow-wow!\\" (or some variation, commonly featuring the word \\"zowie\\") whenever he gets excited.America Toons In: A History of Television Animation By David Perlmutter page 154 Broadcast history Sixteen 30-minute episodes of Jabberjaw were produced, which aired on ABC Saturday Morning from September 11, 1976, to September 3, 1977, and rebroadcast for a second season of reruns on Sunday Morning from September 11, 1977, to September 3, 1978. In the 1980s, repeats resurfaced as part of USA Cartoon Express on USA Network, in the 1990s on Cartoon Network and in the 2000s on Boomerang. This is one of a number of shows made before the mid-1980s seen on the Cartoon Network and Boomerang to have been taken from PAL prints. Like many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a laugh track created by the studio.

Biography King attended Sevenoaks School, where he was a member of the 'Art Room' that produced musicians Tom Greenhalgh and Mark White of The Mekons, along with Andy Gill of Gang of Four, documentarian Adam Curtis, and film director Paul Greengrass. As Gang of Four lyricist and co-songwriter, he sang and played melodica and percussion such as a microwave oven or wooden block (using a baseball bat or a stick), the latter notably on the song \\"He'd Send in the Army\\". Jon Pareles in The New York Times described King's lyrics as \\"bitterly analytical, infused with theories from Marx, Adorno, Baudrillard and Godard, and the band was determined to puncture pop romance with the consciousness that people are manipulated by power, economics, media and marketing. Jon King co-wrote and co-produced Entertainment!, Gang of Four's debut album, regularly listed as among the top 100 albums of all time and described by Rolling Stone magazine as \\"the best debut album by a British band ‚Äì punk or otherwise ‚Äì since the original English release of The Clash in 1977.David Fricke, Rolling Stone, 7 August 1980. Referring to the influence of Situationist ideas on Gang of Four's work, Jon King remarked, in a 1980 letter to Greil Marcus, that \\"where I think that Situationism was good was in the development of its revolutionary tactic: 'reinvesting' the cultural past. Situationism conspicuously used popular imagery in order to subvert it ‚Äì to make the familiar strange, rather than rejecting the familiar out of hand. The tactic was good, worth ripping off, as in the Entertainment! cover, or the original \\"Damaged Goods\\" sleeve.\\"1980 letter by King to Greil Marcus quoted in \\"Pop Music and the Limits of Cultural Critique: Gang of Four Shrinkwraps Entertainment.\\" Author/s: Michael Hoover fall 1998. In an interview with NPR the author stated \\"King's lyrics have always meant different things to different people. Some see his words as a reaction to Margaret Thatcher, unemployment in early-'80s Britain or the unraveling of the unions. But King says he was more interested in \\"changing the meaning of things by the label\\". King said in the same feature: \\"I remember when I was 15, I got incredibly excited when I found some grubby old book in a secondhand bookshop about the revolution in Paris in 1968 (...) There was a picture, which I still cherish ‚Äì it was a photograph for some kind of perfume and a very glamorous-looking woman on this poster, and someone had written on it in French: \\"You know I know I'm exploiting you, but I'm not doing it on purpose\\". I got terribly excited by the fact ... you can change the meaning of things by the label... I wondered how one could play around with these sorts of ideas in music\\". King said of his lyrics, quoted by Michael Hoover: \\"If you, say, look at the published agenda of music which limits itself to a very small set of subjects and the way it approaches these subjects (which in its most extreme identity is a sort of Bryan Adams-style song), about missing or making up with your girl, driving the car, in some sort of all-white, midwestern high school, which is an incredibly common motif ... I don't know anything about that. That is something which is a very specific American topic, but it seems to be exhaustively gone around. I had a chance to describe it the other night, like a dog returning to its own vomit. The Guardian, in its citation of Entertainment! as one of 100 greatest British albums of all time, said that King's \\"lyrics performed the minor miracle of rendering deconstructionist slogans - Marx and Engels by way of Guy Debord - into telegrammatic rock'n'roll rabble-rousing\\". \\"In other words, pop songs as false emotional advertising and ideology as everydayness are themselves grounds for inquiry\\", as King told Greil Marcus, because \\"unless you have an awareness of your views as political manifestations, you won't believe you can change them\\". A 2014 re-appraisal of Entertainment! said, in reference to King's lyrics, that they \\"deal with one of Karl Marx‚Äôs theories most widely favoured by the Situationists, the guttansweng (\\"species-being\\"). The guttansweng is the idea that people become separated from their human nature and thus become alienated within a capitalist environment... \\"At Home He's A Tourist\\" is surely inspired by chapter 30 of Debord's definitive text Society of the Spectacle, which features the lines \\"the externality of the spectacle in relation to the active man appears in the fact that his gestures are no longer his but those of another who represent them to him. This is why the spectator feels at home nowhere, because the spectacle is everywhere\\". King himself, talking about the same song, said: \\"Sometimes, you get lucky and a line comes that makes everything easy. Suddenly getting the answer to a question when you turn off and think about something else. Thrown-ness - if that's a word at all ‚Äì was something we puzzled over. Why, if everything is like it is, do so many things seem ersatz, phoney. But it's not phoney if you know it's phoney, as Truman Capote said of Holly Golightly \\"she's not a phoney because she's a real phoney\\". In 1986 King toured in the US with a band called Mechanic Preachers. King has written music for TV and film, notably title music for the BBC's Pandora's Box, Scrutiny and Westminster Daily. He co-wrote and produced songs featured on TV and the soundtracks of major movies such as The Karate Kid (1984), The Manchurian Candidate (2004), and Marie Antoinette (2006); \\"13 Reasons Why\\" ( Netflix) The OC (HBO); and \\"Treme\\" (HBO). \\"Natural's Not in It\\" (from the album Entertainment!) was used for 2012's global Xbox ad campaign. He won in 2005 (as Gang of Four) Mojo Magazine's \\"Inspiration to Music\\" MOJO Awards and the Diesel U Music \\"Outstanding Contribution / Lifetime Achievement\\" award.. In 2011 he performed with Gang of Four on The David Letterman Show and Jools Holland. Since his time in Gang of Four, King has had a career in media.

Another method is to use a doorstop which is a small wedge of wood, rubber, fabric, plastic, cotton or another material. Manufactured wedges of these materials are commonly available. The wedge is kicked into position and the downward force of the door, now jammed upwards onto the doorstop, provides enough static friction to keep it motionless. A third strategy is to equip the door itself with a stopping mechanism. In this case, a short metal bar capped with rubber, or another high-friction material, is attached to a hinge near the bottom of the door opposite the door hinge and on the side of the door which is in the direction that it closes. When the door is to be kept open, the bar is swung down so that the rubber end touches the floor. In this configuration, further movement of the door towards being closed increases the force on the rubber end, thereby increasing the frictional force which opposes the movement. When the door is to be closed, the stop is released by pushing the door slightly more open, which releases the stop and allows it to be flipped upwards. A newer version of equipping the door with the stopping mechanism is to attach a magnet to the bottom of the door on the side which opens outward which then latches onto another magnet or magnetic material on the wall or a small hub on the floor. The magnet must be strong enough to hold the weight of the door, but weak enough to be easily detached from the wall or hub.

In this case a rubber cylinder or dome, or a rod or block of rubber-tipped metal, wood or plastic, is screwed into the wall or the floor in the path of the door. If it is attached to the wall, it may be either a few inches above the ground, or at such a height as to meet the doorknob. A short, wall-attached doorstop, usually a rubber dome or cylinder, is sometimes called a wall bumper. On occasion, stops are used that are fitted at the midpoint of the door, as part of the central door-hinge. Such a stop is known as a \\"hinge stop\\".

The members of the council were appointed directly by the President; the President also chose the chairperson of the council (last appointed Chair was Edmund D. Pellegrino). Council members, totaling no more than 18, were appointed for a two-year term, after which time they could be reappointed by the President. Individuals appointed could not be officers or employees of the federal government.

Colleen Carroll Campbell, a former speechwriter for President Bush and a member of the conservative advocacy group Ethics and Public Policy Center predicted that \\"Obama's desire to see his policies backed by expert 'consensus' more likely will be realized with a new commission composed of like-minded political liberals steeped in utilitarianism than with the brainy, diverse and unpredictable crew that populated the now-defunct council.\\"Campbell, Colleen Carroll.

It is a catch-all phrase for this type of craft and over the years it has gradually increased in size, changed with the advent of new technologies for locomotion, and been crafted from increasingly more durable materials. History =Wooden gigs= Captain Mervine during the annual Sloat's Landing ceremony in Monterey, California, 2013 In general, during the era of wooden ships, it was smaller and lighter than the longboat, barge or pinnace. It was usually crewed by four oarsmen and a coxswain. Generally the oarsmen sat one to a seat, but each only rowed a single oar on alternating sides. The gig was not as sea kindly as the longboat, but was used mostly in harbors. The gigs generally had a high wineglass transom, full skeg, full keel, straight stem and somewhat rounded sides. There was in general very little rocker in the keel. The gunwales on many were nearly straight from bow to stern. It appears to be the precursor to the Whitehall Rowboat. Some wooden captain's gigs were quite large and were powered by sail. =Modern gigs= A U.S. Navy sailor hauls a motor whaleboat and the captain's gig in the hangar deck of in April 2004 With the coming of metal ships and combustion engines the size of the captain's gig increased and the boats could transport more sailors swiftly. Some modern built craft with sails have been named captain's gig as well. In the U.S. Navy, the Captain's Gig varied by the size of the ship, with aircraft carriers and, until the mid-1990s when they were decommissioned, battleships, typically assigned a double cabin cruiser that was 33 to 35 feet in length. These boats were typically painted with a white superstructure and gray hull with a red waterline stripe and black hull below the waterline. They would also frequently have the parent ship's hull identifier and hull number marked on the port and starboard bows with chromed metal letters & digits with two half of an arrow in front and back of the hull identifier. The front half of an arrow, with the arrowhead pointed toward the bow was forward of and the back half of the arrow was aft of the hull identifiers. The name of the parent vessel was emblazoned on the transom with chrome letters. Because these capital ships also held a dual function as flagships for an embarked admiral, an identical vessel, albeit painted with a black hull and green waterline stripe functioned as an Admiral's Barge. Chromed metal star(s) adorned the port & starboard bow, the number of stars corresponding to the flag officer's rank. The flag officer's standardized abbreviated command name was mounted in chromed metal letters directly on transom or on wood board mounted on the transom. In early 2008, in an economy move, Captain's Gigs were eliminated from all U.S. Navy ships.http://archive.navytimes.com/article/20080210/NEWS/802100313/Long- skipper-s-perk-gig-going-away In popular culture * In science fiction, the term is often used to refer to a small auxiliary spacecraft. In Star Trek, the craft is referred to as a \\"captain's yacht\\". *In the song \\"The Flowers of Bermuda\\" by Stan Rogers, using the captain's gig saves the crew from drowning in a ship wreck that destroys the life boats, though the captain elects to stay behind when there is one more crew than place to man on the gig and perishes.

Early life Burns was born in Belfast and grew up in Joanmount in Ballysillan. Burns' mother was a seamstress, and his father was a machinist in a textile machinery factory/steel foundry, where he was a shop steward, and his socialist views were an influence on Burns. Prior to punk, Burns' musical influences included Rory Gallagher, Dr. Feelgood, Graham Parker, and Bob Marley. Career =Stiff Little Fingers= Burns started off his career at Belfast Boys' Model School with a rock covers band, Highway Star, which consisted of Burns, Gordon Blair, Henry Cluney, and Brian Faloon. Gordon Blair subsequently left the group to join Rudi, and Ali McMordie joined, about the time the band discovered punk. They were briefly named The Fast, but as there was already a group of that name they changed it to Stiff Little Fingers, taken from the song of the same name that had appeared on Pure Mania, the 1977 album by The Vibrators. Apart from a 5 year gap, from 1983-1987, Stiff Little Fingers have been active since 1977 to the present day and have released 10 studio albums. =Solo work= In 1981, Burns made his acting debut in an episode of the BBC's Play For Today series entitled Iris in the Traffic, Ruby in the Rain, written by Belfast-born poet and playwright Stewart Parker, which also featured the rest of Stiff Little Fingers effectively playing themselves as 'The Band'. After the breakup of SLF in 1983, Burns formed Jake Burns and the Big Wheel. The band consisted of Burns on Vocals and Guitar, Steve Grantley on drums, Sean Martin on bass guitar, and Pete Saunders on keyboards. Big Wheel recorded a total of three singles, \\"On Fortune Street\\", \\"She Grew Up\\" and \\"Breathless\\". A compilation album, also called On Fortune Street, was released after the band's demise, in 2002. In 1987, Burns disbanded Big Wheel, and Stiff Little Fingers reformed, because they were \\"skint and wanted to make a bit of cash to get back to Ireland for Christmas\\". From about 2001 to 2005, Burns was involved in a side project with Pauline Black of The Selecter, called 3 Men and Black. This involved Black touring with three male artists from the late 1970s, early 1980s doing acoustic versions of songs they are famous for, and talking a little about how they came to write the songs etc. The line up for the concerts was fairly fluid, and has included such people as Bruce Foxton, J.J. Burnel, Eric Faulkner and Nick Welsh. On 27 March 2006, Burns released a solo album titled Drinkin' Again. In 2009, Burns formed a Chicago punk rock super group called The Nefarious Fat Cats to raise money for local charities. Notable members include John Haggerty (Pegboy, Naked Raygun), Joe Haggerty (Pegboy), Joe Principe (Rise Against), Scott Lucas (Local H), Herb Rosen (Beer Nuts, Right of the Accused) and Mark DeRosa (Dummy). Mr. Burns also contributed guitar and vocals on a track of The Black Sheep Band charity record for Children's Memorial Hospital, A Chicago Punk Rock Collaboration for the Kids, Vol 1. In 2016, Burns joined an acoustic \\"supergroup\\" formed by Kirk Brandon, of Spear of Destiny called Dead Men Walking which also included David Ruffy and John \\"Segs\\" Jennings, both of Ruts DC. Personal life Burns lived in London for over ten years from 1978 after Stiff Little Fingers had relocated there. His first wife was from Newcastle upon Tyne, and after their marriage, he moved to Newcastle, where he lived for 16 years, becoming a supporter of Newcastle United F.C.. He is also an avid supporter of the Northern Ireland national football team. Burns' second wife, Shirley, is American and they have lived in Chicago since 2004. Burns would eventually become a US citizen, partially so he could help vote out Donald Trump.

Pop Rocks ingredients include sugar, lactose (milk sugar), and flavoring. It differs from typical hard candy in that pressurized carbon dioxide gas bubbles are embedded inside of the candy, creating a small popping reaction when it dissolves in one's mouth. Background and history The concept was patented by General Foods research chemists Leon T. Kremzner and William A. Mitchell on December 12, 1961 (U.S. patent #3,012,893), but the candy was not offered to the public until 1975 by General Foods, which in 1983 withdrew it, citing its lack of success in the marketplace, and its relatively short shelf life. Distribution was initially controlled to ensure freshness; but with its increasing popularity, unauthorized redistribution from market to market resulted in out-of-date product reaching consumers. After that, Kraft Foods licensed the Pop Rocks brand to Zeta Espacial S.A. who continued manufacturing the product under Kraft's license. Eventually Zeta Espacial S.A. became the brand's owner and sole manufacturer. Pop Rocks is distributed in the U.S. by Pop Rocks Inc. (Atlanta, Georgia) and by Zeta Espacial S.A. (Barcelona, Spain) in the rest of the world. Zeta Espacial S.A. also sells popping candy internationally under other brands including Peta Zetas, Wiz Fizz, and Magic Gum. In 2008, Marvin J. Rudolph, who led the group assigned to bring Pop Rocks out of the laboratory and into the manufacturing plant, wrote a history of Pop Rocks development. The book, titled Pop Rocks: The Inside Story of America's Revolutionary Candy, was based on interviews with food technologists, engineers, marketing managers, and members of Billy Mitchell's family, along with the author's experience. In the book, Rudolph points out that the Turkish company HLEKS Popping Candy flooded the market with popping candy in the year 2000. A similar product, Cosmic Candy, previously called Space Dust, was in powdered form and was also manufactured by General Foods. In 2012, Cadbury Schweppes Pty. Ltd. (in Australia) began producing a chocolate product named \\"Marvellous Creations Jelly Popping Candy Beanies\\" which contains popping candy, jelly beans and beanies (candy covered chocolate).Cadbury Marvellous Creations By 2013 Whittakers (New Zealand) had also released a local product (white chocolate with a local carbonated drink \\"Lemon and Paeroa' or \\"L&P;\\" for short). Prominent British chef Heston Blumenthal has also made several desserts incorporating popping candy, both for the peculiar sensory experience of the popping and for the nostalgia value of using an ingredient popular in the 1970s. Manufacturing As described by a 1980 patent, the candy is made by dissolving sugars in water and is evaporated at until the water content is 3% by mass. The water and sugar mixture is then cooled to , and while being intensely stirred it is pressurized with carbon dioxide at . The mixture is then kept under pressure and allowed to cool and solidify, embedding the carbon dioxide bubbles in the candy. The majority of the resultant carbon dioxide bubbles are between in diameter. When the pressure on the cooled and solidified candy is released, it shatters into pieces that vary in size. Urban legend Rumors persisted that eating Pop Rocks and drinking soda would cause a person's stomach to boil and explode. This was, in part, caused by the false assumption that Pop Rocks contain an acid/base mixture (such as baking soda and vinegar) which produces large volumes of gas when mixed through chewing and saliva.Discovery Channel :: Mythbusters: Episode Guide One of these myths involved child actor John Gilchrist (\\"Little Mikey\\" in 1970s Life cereal television commercials), who was falsely rumored to have died after consuming excess amounts of Pop Rocks and Coca-Cola. Though the confection had been extensively tested and found safe, the carbonated candy still alarmed residents in Seattle. The Food and Drug Administration set up a hotline there to assure anxious parents that the fizzing candy would not cause their children to choke. General Foods was battling the \\"exploding kid\\" rumors as early as 1979. General Foods sent letters to school principals,Rudolph, Dr. Marvin J. (September 2006) Pop Rocks The Inside Story of America's Revolutionary Candy Appendix 5. created an open letter to parents,Rudolph, Dr. Marvin J. (September 2006) Pop Rocks The Inside Story of America's Revolutionary Candy Appendix 3. took out advertisements in major publications and sent the confection's inventor on the road to explain that a Pop Rocks package contains less gas (namely, carbon dioxide, the same gas used in all carbonated beverages) than half a can of soda. Because of the unique flavor of the legend, and the duration of its perpetuation, the story has appeared in many other forms of media and fiction. On the very first episode of MythBusters, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman put the Mikey rumor to the test by mixing six packs of Pop Rocks and a six-pack of cola inside a pig's stomach, complete with enough hydrochloric acid to simulate the acid inside a human stomach. Despite the pig stomach growing to three times its initial size, it did not blow up even after time was allotted for digestion. In another stomach used as an experimental counterpart, only a large amount of sodium bicarbonate along with acid and soda (and without any Pop Rocks) was able to cause a gastric rupture. The broadcast included interview clips with Pop Rocks Inc. vice president Fernando Arguis explaining the candy and the myth, and Savage later alluded to the myth at a presentation at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute by showing that Pop Rocks and soda‚Äîalbeit in a smaller amount‚Äîin his own stomach was not fatal.

Urine and feces enter the pit through a drop hole in the floor, which might be connected to a toilet seat or squatting pan for user comfort. Pit latrines can be built to function without water (dry toilet) or they can have a water seal (pour-flush pit latrine). When properly built and maintained, pit latrines can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. This decreases the transfer of pathogens between feces and food by flies. These pathogens are major causes of infectious diarrhea and intestinal worm infections. Infectious diarrhea resulted in about 700,000 deaths in children under five years old in 2011 and 250 million lost school days. Pit latrines are a low-cost method of separating feces from people. A pit latrine generally consists of three major parts: a hole in the ground, a concrete slab or floor with a small hole, and a shelter. The shelter is also called an outhouse. The pit is typically at least three meters (10 feet) deep and one meter (3.2 feet) across. The hole in the slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in. Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies. This may require the use of a lid to cover the hole in the floor when not in use. The World Health Organization recommends the pits are built a reasonable distance from the house, balancing issues of easy access versus that of smell. The distance from water wells and surface water should be at least 10 meters (32 feet) to decrease the risk of groundwater pollution. When the pit fills to within 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. Fecal sludge management involves emptying pits as well as transporting, treating and using the collected fecal sludge. If this is not carried out properly, water pollution and public health risks can occur. A basic pit latrine can be improved in a number of ways. One includes adding a ventilation pipe from the pit to above the structure. This improves airflow and decreases the smell of the toilet. It also can reduce flies when the top of the pipe is covered with mesh (usually made out of fiberglass). In these types of toilets a lid need not be used to cover the hole in the floor. Other possible improvements include a floor constructed so fluid drains into the hole and a reinforcement of the upper part of the pit with bricks, blocks, or cement rings to improve stability. In developing countries the cost of a simple pit toilet is typically between US$25 and $60. Recurring expenditure costs are between US$1.5 and $4 per person per year for a traditional pit latrine, and up to three times higher for a pour flush pit latrine (without the costs of emptying). As of 2013 pit latrines are used by an estimated 1.77 billion people, mostly in developing countries. About 892 million people (12 percent of the global population), practiced open defecation in 2016, mostly because they have no toilets. Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest access to toilets. The Indian government has been running a campaign called \\"Swachh Bharat Abhiyan\\" (Clean India Mission in English) since 2014 in order to eliminate open defecation by convincing people in rural areas to purchase, construct and use toilets, mainly pit latrines. It is estimated that 85 million pit latrines have been built due to that campaign as of 2018. Another example from India is the \\"No Toilet, No Bride\\" campaign which promotes toilet uptake by encouraging women to refuse to marry men who do not own a toilet.  Definitions  Depending on the region, the term \\"pit latrine\\" may be used to denote a toilet that has a squatting pan with a water seal or siphon (more accurately termed a pour-flush pit latrine ‚Äì very common in South East Asia for example) or simply a hole in the ground without a water seal (also called a simple pit latrine) ‚Äì the common type in most countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Whilst a dry toilet can be with or without urine diversion, a pit latrine is almost always without urine diversion. The key characteristic of a pit latrine is the use of a pit, which infiltrates liquids into the ground and acts as a device for storage and very limited treatment. Pit latrines are sometimes also referred to as \\"dry toilets\\". However, some pit latrines do use water for flushing and are therefore not a \\"dry toilet\\". Dry toilets is an overarching term used for several types of toilets, and only refers to the type of user interface, not the storage or treatment part. = Improved or unimproved sanitation = A pit latrine may or may not count towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) target of increasing access to sanitation for the world's population, depending on the type of pit latrine: A pit latrine without a slab is regarded as unimproved sanitation and does not count towards the target. A pit latrine with a slab, a ventilated improved pit latrine and a pour flush pit latrine connected to a pit or septic tank are counted as being \\"improved sanitation\\" facilities as they are more likely to hygienically separate human excreta from human contact.WHO and UNICEF definitions of improved drinking-water source on the JMP website, WHO, Geneva and UNICEF, New York, accessed on 16 December 2015  Design considerations  = Size of the drop hole = The user positions themself over the small drop hole during use. The size of the feces drop hole in the floor or slab should not be larger than 25 centimeters (9.8 inches) to prevent children falling in. Light should be prevented from entering the pit to reduce access by flies. = Lids on the drop hole or toilet seat = A lid on the drop hole keeps light out of the pit and helps to stop flies and odors entering the toilet's superstructure. The lid can be made from plastic or wood and is used to cover the hole in the floor when the pit latrine is not in use. In practice, such a lid is not commonly used for squatting type pit latrines but only for sitting type pit latrines with a toilet seat. = Squatting pan or toilet seat = On top of the drop hole there can either be nothing (this is the simplest form of a pit latrine) or there can be a squatting pan, seat (pedestal) or bench which can be made of concrete, ceramic, plastic or wood. = Shelter = A shelter, shed, small building or \\"super-structure\\" houses the squatting pan or toilet seat and provides privacy and protection from the weather for the user. Ideally, the shelter or small building should have handwashing facilities available inside or on the outside (e.g. supplied with water from a rainwater harvesting tank on the roof of the shelter) although this is unfortunately rarely the case in practice. In the shelter, anal cleansing materials (e.g. toilet paper) and a solid waste bin should also be available. A more substantial structure may also be built, commonly known as an outhouse. = Locating the pit = Common problem: water well (foreground) is in close proximity to the pit latrine (brick building at the back), leading to groundwater pollution (example from Lusaka, Zambia) Liquids leach from the pit and pass the unsaturated soil zone (which is not completely filled with water). Subsequently, these liquids from the pit enter the groundwater where they may lead to groundwater pollution. This is a problem if a nearby water well is used to supply groundwater for drinking water purposes. During the passage in the soil, pathogens can die off or be absorbed significantly, mostly depending on the travel time between the pit and the well.DVGW (2006) Guidelines on drinking water protection areas ‚Äì Part 1: Groundwater protection areas . Bonn, Deutsche Vereinigung des Gas- und Wasserfaches e.V. Technical rule number W101:2006-06 Most, but not all pathogens die within 50 days of travel through the subsurface.Nick, A., Foppen, J. W., Kulabako, R., Lo, D., Samwel, M., Wagner, F., Wolf, L. (2012). Sustainable sanitation and groundwater protection ‚Äì Factsheet of Working Group 11 . Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA) The degree of pathogen removal strongly varies with soil type, aquifer type, distance and other environmental factors. For this reason, it is difficult to estimate the safe distance between a pit and a water source ‚Äì a problem that also applies to septic tanks. Detailed guidelines have been developed to estimate safe distances to protect groundwater sources from pollution from on-site sanitation.ARGOSS (2001). Guidelines for assessing the risk to groundwater from on-site sanitation . NERC, British Geological Survey Commissioned Report, CR/01/142, UKMoore, C., Nokes, C., Loe, B., Close, M., Pang, L., Smith, V., Osbaldiston, S. (2010) Guidelines for separation distances based on virus transport between on-site domestic wastewater systems and wells, Porirua, New Zealand , p. 296 However, these are mostly ignored by those building pit latrines. In addition to that, household plots are of a limited size and therefore pit latrines are often built much closer to groundwater wells than what can be regarded as safe. This results in groundwater pollution and household members falling sick when using this groundwater as a source of drinking water. As a very general guideline it is recommended that the bottom of the pit should be at least 2 m above groundwater level, and a minimum horizontal distance of 30 m between a pit and a water source is normally recommended to limit exposure to microbial contamination.[1]However, no general statement should be made regarding the minimum lateral separation distances required to prevent contamination of a well from a pit latrine.Wolf, L., Nick, A., Cronin, A. (2015). How to keep your groundwater drinkable: Safer siting of sanitation systems ‚Äì Working Group 11 Publication. Sustainable Sanitation Alliance For example, even 50 m lateral separation distance might not be sufficient in a strongly karstified system with a downgradient supply well or spring, while 10 m lateral separation distance is completely sufficient if there is a well developed clay cover layer and the annular space of the groundwater well is well sealed. If the local hydrogeological conditions (which can vary within a space of a few square kilometres) are ignored, pit latrines can cause significant public health risks via contaminated groundwater. In addition to the issue of pathogens, there is also the issue of nitrate pollution in groundwater from pit latrines. Elevated nitrate levels in drinking water from private wells is thought to have caused cases of blue baby syndrome in children in rural areas of Romania and Bulgaria in Eastern Europe.Buitenkamp, M., Richert Stintzing, A. (2008). Europe's sanitation problem ‚Äì 20 million Europeans need access to safe and affordable sanitation . Women in Europe for a Common Future (WECF), The Netherlands = Pit lining =  Partial  Schematic of the pit of a pit latrine. The defecation hole in the slab is shown at the top, and the user squats or sits above this defecation hole. Pits can be lined with a support ring at the top of the pit as shown in this schematic. Digging the pit for an Arborloo, a type of pit toilet in Cap-Haitien, Haiti A \\"partially lined\\" pit latrine is one where the upper part of the hole in the ground is lined. Pit lining materials can include brick, rot-resistant timber, concrete, stones, or mortar plastered onto the soil. This partial lining is recommended for those pit latrine used by a great number of people ‚Äî such as a public restroom in rural areas, or in a woodland park or busy lay-by, rest stop or other similarly busy location ‚Äî or where the soils are unstable in order to increase permanence and allow emptying of the pit without it collapsing easily. The bottom of the pit should remain unlined to allow for the infiltration of liquids out of the pit.  Fully  A fully lined pit latrine has concrete lining also at the base so that no liquids infiltrate into the ground. One could argue that this is no longer a \\"pit\\" latrine in the stricter sense. The advantage is that no groundwater contamination can occur. The major disadvantage is that a fully lined pit latrine fills up very fast (as the urine cannot escape the pit) which results in high costs to empty and maintain the latrine. Increased odour can also be an issue as the pit content is much wetter and emits more odour. This type of pit latrine is used only in special circumstances, e.g. in denser settlements where groundwater protection is paramount. = Appropriateness = Pit latrines are often built in developing countries even in situations where they are not recommended. These include (adapted fromRieck, C., von M√ºnch, E., Hoffmann, H. (2012). Technology review of urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs) ‚Äì Overview on design, management, maintenance and costs . Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany): * Frequent flooding, resulting in inoperable toilet systems and the contamination of water resources; * Unfavourable soil conditions, such as unstable or rocky soil and high water table, making pit-based sanitation difficult and expensive; * When groundwater is the primary source of drinking water and is likely to be contaminated by pit-based sanitation (for example in denser settlements or with unfavourable hydrogeological conditions); * Limited land space restricts the excavation of new pits if full pit latrines are usually not emptied; * Indoor installations are preferred as they provide greater comfort and security at night thus making them more accessible for all In conditions where pit latrines are not suitable for the above-mentioned reasons, the installations of other types of toilets should be considered, e.g. the urine-diverting dry toilet (UDDT).  Types  Pit latrines collect human feces in a hole in the ground. The principle of a pit latrine is that all liquids that enter the pitin particular urine and water used for anal cleansingseep into the ground (the only exception are fully lined pit latrines, see below).

File:MLS Kou≈ôim, kadibudka.jpgInterior of an outhouse the structure usually built over the pit to provide privacy. = Ventilated improved pit = The ventilated improved pit latrine (VIP) is a pit latrine with a black pipe (vent pipe) fitted to the pit and a screen (flyscreen) at the top outlet of the pipe. VIP latrines are an improvement to overcome the disadvantages of simple pit latrines, e.g. fly and mosquito nuisance and unpleasant odors. The smell is carried upwards by the chimney effect and flies are prevented from leaving the pit and spreading disease. Despite their simplicity, well-designed single VIPs can be completely smell free, and more pleasant to use than some other water-based technologies. Flies that hatch in the pit are attracted to the light at the top of the ventilation pipe. When they fly towards the light and try to escape, they are trapped by the flyscreen and die. The ventilation also allows odours to escape and minimizes the attraction for flies. The principal mechanism of ventilation in VIP latrines is the action of wind blowing across the top of the vent pipe. The wind creates a strong circulation of air through the superstructure, down through the squat hole, across the pit and up and out of the vent pipe. Unpleasant fecal odors from the pit contents are thus sucked up and exhausted out of vent pipe, leaving the superstructure odor-free. In some cases solar- powered fans are added giving a constant outwards flow from the vent pipe. Flies searching for an egg-laying site are attracted by fecal odors coming from the vent pipe, but they are prevented from entering by the flyscreen at the outlet of the vent pipe. Some flies may enter into the pit via the squat hole and lay their eggs there. When new adult flies emerge, they instinctively fly towards light. However, if the latrine is dark inside, the only light they can see is at the top of the vent pipe. Since the vent pipe is covered by a fly screen at the top, flies will not be able to escape and eventually will die and fall back into the pit. To ensure that there is a flow of air through the latrine, there must be adequate ventilation of the superstructure. This is usually achieved by leaving openings above and below the door, or by constructing a spiral wall without a door.Ahmed, M.F. & Rahman, M.M. (2003). Water Supply & Sanitation: Rural and Low Income Urban Communities, 2nd Edition, ITN-Bangladesh. . Covering the feces with an absorbent decreases smell and discourages flies. These may include soil, sawdust, ash, or lime, among others. In developing countries, the use of absorbents in pit toilets is not commonly practiced. The vent pipe should have an internal diameter of at least 110 mm and reach more than 300 mm above the highest point of the toilet superstructure. Wind passing over the top creates a suction pressure within the vent pipe and induces an air circulation. Air is drawn through the User Interface into the pit, moves up inside the vent pipe and escapes into the atmosphere. Care should be taken that objects, such as trees or houses, do not interfere with the air stream. The vent works best in windy areas, but where there is little wind, its effectiveness can be improved by painting the pipe black. The heat difference between the pit (cool) and the vent (warm) creates an updraft that pulls the air and odours up and out of the pit. To test the efficacy of the ventilation, a lit cigarette can be held over the User Interface; the smoke should be pulled down into the pit and up into the vent and not remain in the superstructure. The mesh size of the fly screen must be large enough to prevent clogging with dust and allow air to circulate freely. Aluminium screens, with a hole-size of 1.2 to 1.5 mm, have proven to be the most effective. Typically, the pit is at least 3 m deep and 1 to 1.5 m in diameter, depending on the number of users. Deep pits can last up to 20 or more years. As liquid leaches from the pit and migrates through the unsaturated soil matrix, pathogenic germs are sorbed to the soil surface. In this way, pathogens can be removed prior to contact with groundwater. The degree of removal varies with soil type, distance travelled, moisture and other environmental factors and, thus, it is difficult to estimate the distance necessary between a pit and a water source. A minimum horizontal distance of 30 m between a pit and a water source and 2 m between the bottom of the pit and the groundwater table is normally recommended to limit exposure to microbial contamination. = Twin pit designs = Design of a twin pit latrine. A further possible improvement is the use of a second pit which is used in alternation with the first pit. It means that the first pit can rest for the duration of time it takes to fill up the second pit. When the second pit is also full, then the first pit is emptied. The fecal sludge collected in that first pit has in the meantime undergone some degree of pathogen reduction although this is unlikely to be complete. This is a common design for so- called twin-pit pour flush toilets and increases the safety for those having to enter the pit. Also VIPs are sometimes built with two pits, although for VIP toilets one problem can be that the users may not stick to this alternation method and fill up both pits at the same time. The pits should be of an adequate size to accommodate a volume of waste generated over one or two years. This allows the contents of the full pit enough time to transform into a partially sanitized, soil-like material that can be manually excavated. It is recommended that the twin pits be constructed 1 m apart from each other to minimize cross-contamination between the maturing pit and the one in use. It is also recommended that the pits be constructed over 1 m from any structural foundation as leachate can negatively impact structural supports. Water within the pit can impact its stability. Therefore, the full depth of the pit walls should be lined to prevent collapse and the top 30 cm should be fully mortared to prevent direct infiltration and to support the superstructure. There is a risk of groundwater pollution when pits are located in areas with a high or variable water table, and/or fissures or cracks in the bedrock. As soil and groundwater properties are often unknown, it is difficult to estimate the distance necessary between a pit and a water source. It is normally recommended to have a minimum horizontal distance of 30 m between them to limit exposing the water source to microbial contamination. To ensure that only one of the two pits is used at any time, the idle pipe of the junction connecting to the out -of- use pit should be closed (e.g. with cement or bricks). = Pour-flush pit latrine = Pour-flush pit latrine schematic showing squatting pan with water seal In a pour-flush pit latrine, a squatting or pedestal toilet with a water seal (U-trap or siphon) is used over one or two offset pits. Therefore, these types of toilets do require water for flushing but otherwise have many of the same characteristics as simple pit latrines. About one to three liters of water is used per flush in that case, and they often have two pits that are used one after the other (\\"twin pit pour flush pit latrine\\"). For this reason they are subsumed under the term \\"pit latrine\\". The fecal sludge that is removed from the full pits of twin-pit pour-flush pit latrines is somewhat safer to handle and reuse than the fecal sludge from single pit pour-flush latrines. However, significant health risks for the workers who are emptying the pits remain in either case. A counterweight slab (called SaTo pan) installed in a pit latrine in Rwanda, converting it to a pour flush pit latrine An alternative to U-trap or siphon designs is to incorporate a counter-weighted trap door mechanism that provides an air-tight water seal in the closed position. Addition of a small amount of water (generally less than 500 ml) overcomes the counterweight and allows the fecal matter to enter the pit. The devices are sold under the name of \\"SaTo pan\\" for as little as US$1.85, and more than 800,000 of them have been installed worldwide since introduction in 2013. = Cat hole = A cat hole is a one-time-use pit toilet often utilized by campers, hikers and other outdoor recreationalists. It is also called the \\"cat method\\" and simply means digging a little hole just large enough for the feces of one defecation event which is afterwards covered with soil.  Maintenance  A sanitation worker empties a pit latrine manually near Durban, South Africa fecal sludge from the pit of a pit latrine without wearing any personal protective equipment (in a village in Burkina Faso). Bad practice example: Sanitation workers dump fecal sludge from pits into a river at Korogocho slum near Nairobi, Kenya The requirements for safe pit emptying and fecal sludge management are often forgotten by those building pit latrines, as the pit will only fill up in a few years time. However, in many developing countries safe fecal sludge management practices are lacking and causing public health risks as well as environmental pollution. = Pit emptying = When the pit is full, the toilet is no longer usable. The time it takes to fill the pit depends on its volume, the number of users, the soil permeability and groundwater level. It can typically take between one and ten years or even longer in some exceptional cases. At that point, the pit can be covered and abandoned, and a new pit latrine built if space on the property permits this. The new pit latrine may reuse the shelter (superstructure) if the shelter can be moved without collapsing. In peri-urban or urban areas, full pits are not abandoned but rather emptied by sanitation workers or the household members themselves so that the toilets can continue to be used at the same location after the emptying has taken place. The emptying can be done manually with shovels and buckets, with manually powered pumps or with motorized pumps mounted on a vacuum truck which carries a tank for storage. For the fecal sludge to be pumpable, water usually needs to be added to the pit and the content stirred up, which is messy and smelly. Procedures for safe emptying of fecal sludge from pit latrines is a priority for many developing countries where many new pit latrines have been built in rural areas in recent years, such as in Bangladesh. Fecal sludge that has been removed from pits manually or with vacuum tankers is often dumped into the environment indiscriminately, leading to what has been called \\"institutionalized open defecation\\". = Sludge management = The fecal sludge may be transported by road to a sewage treatment facility, or to be composted elsewhere. There are numerous licensed waste hauling companies providing such service in areas where it is needed in developed countries, although in developing countries such services are not well regulated and are often carried out by untrained, unskilled and unprotected informal workers. When managed and treated correctly to achieve a high degree of pathogen kill, fecal sludge from pit latrines could be used as a fertilizer due to its high nitrogen, phosphorus and organic matter content. However, it is hard to ensure that this is done in a safe manner. The number of viable helminth eggs is commonly used as an indicator organism to make a statement about the pathogen load in a fecal sludge sample. Helminth eggs are very persistent to most treatment methods and are therefore a good indicator. = Pit additives = A range of commercial products are available which claim to help reduce the volume of feces in the pit and reduce odor and fly problems. They are collectively described as a pit additive and many of them are based on the concept of effective microorganisms. The intention is to add specific strains of microbes to aid the decomposition process ‚Äì but their effectiveness is disputed and recent research found no effect in scientific test conditions.Foxon, K., Still, D. (2012). Do pit additives work? Water Research Commission (WRC), University of KwaZulu-Natal, Partners in Development (PiD), South Africa Wood ash, leaves, soil, compost, or sawdust can be sprinkled on top of the feces to decrease the smell in the case of pit latrines without a water seal. This is however not common practice for users in developing countries. Users often do not expect a pit latrine to be odour free, and endure the smell.  Advantages  Advantages of pit latrines may include: * Can be built and repaired with locally available materials * Low (but variable) capital costs depending on materials and pit depth * Small land area required Measures to improve access to safe water, sanitation and better hygiene, which includes the use of pit latrines instead of open defecation, is believed to be able to prevent nearly 90% of deaths due to infectious diarrhea.  Disadvantages  Disadvantages of pit latrines may include: * Flies and odours are normally noticeable to the users * The toilet has to be outdoors with the associated security risks if the person is living in an insecure situation * Low reduction in organic matter content and pathogens * Possible contamination of groundwater with pathogens and nitrate * Costs to empty the pits may be significant compared to capital costs * Pit emptying is often done in a very unsafe manner * Sludge (called fecal sludge) requires further treatment and/or appropriate discharge * Pit latrines are often relocated or re-built after some years (when the pit is full and if the pit is not emptied) and thus need more space than urine-diverting dry toilets for example and people are less willing to invest in a high-quality super- structure as it will have to be dismantled at some point.  Costs  = Construction = In developing countries the construction cost for a simple pit toilet is between about . This cost figure has a wide range because the costs vary a lot depending on the type of soil, the depth and reinforcement of the pit, the superstructure that the user is willing to pay for, the type of toilet squatting pan or toilet seat chosen, the cost of labour, construction materials (in particular the cost of cement can differ a lot from one country to the next), the ventilation system and so forth. Rather than looking only at the construction cost, the whole of life cost (or life-cycle cost) should be considered, as the regular emptying or re-building of pit latrines may add a significant expense to the households in the longer term. In India, Japan's LIXIL Group has supplied tens of thousands of twin pit toilet systems that costs $10 or less apiece (in 2018). = Recurrent expenditure = Recurring expenditure costs are between US$1.5 and $4 per person per year for a traditional pit latrine. This includes operational and minor expenditure, capital maintenance expenditure and expenditure on direct support but does not include pit emptying costs. The total recurrent expenditure for more \\"upmarket\\" pit latrines has been estimated to be $2.5‚Äì8.5 for a VIP-type pit latrine and $3.5‚Äì11.5 for a pour-flush pit latrine.  Society and culture  =Names= There are numerous colloquial names for pit latrines, such as \\"long drop\\", \\"dunny\\", \\"privy\\". = User experiences = Poorly maintained pit latrine at Ambira Boys High School, Nyanza Province, Kenya Pit latrines may or may not be an enjoyable experience to use. Problems may occur when the pit latrine is shared by too many people, is not cleaned daily and not emptied when the pit is full. In such cases, flies and odour can be a major nuisance. Also, pit latrines are usually dark places which are difficult to keep clean. Often, handwashing facilities are missing. For these reasons, shared pit latrines can be very uncomfortable to use in developing countries. = Alternative to open defecation = About 892 million people, or 12 percent of the global population, practiced open defecation in 2016, mostly because they have no toilets. Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest access to toilets. Pit latrines are a low-cost toilet option that do not require expensive infrastructure. As such, many government agencies and NGOs promote the construction of pit latrines in rural areas (groundwater pollution can be an issue). The community-led total sanitation approach results in the spontaneous construction and sustained use of pit latrines rather than open defecation. =India example= The Indian government has been running the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission) since 2014 in order to eliminate open defecation and to convince people in rural areas to purchase, construct and use toilets, mainly pit latrines. This campaign is a combination of building new toilets and encouraging behavior change. It is estimated that 50 million additional pit latrines have been built due to that campaign between 2014 and 2017. Another example is the campaign that took place in Haryana with slogans such as \\"No Toilet, No Bride\\" or \\"No loo, no \\"I do\\"\\". This campaign promotes the construction of toilets (usually pour flush pit latrine toilets). In rural India, there are sometimes cultural preferences for open defecation and these may be difficult to overcome with unattractive toilet designs, such as pit latrines.

The differential (yellow) is connected directly to the chassis (orange). De Dion rear axle A de Dion tube is an automobile suspension technology. It is a sophisticated form of non- independent suspension and is a considerable improvement over the swing axle, Hotchkiss drive, or live axle.Setright, L. J. K. \\"De Dion axle: The First Step to Independence\\", in Ward, Ian, executive editor. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 5, p.500. Because it plays no part in transmitting power to the drive wheels, it is sometimes called a \\"dead axle\\".Setright, p.515. De Dion suspension uses universal joint at both the wheel hubs and differential, and uses a solid tubular beam to hold the opposite wheels in parallel. Unlike an anti-roll bar, a de Dion tube is not directly connected to the chassis nor is it intended to flex. In suspension geometry it is a beam axle suspension. History The de Dion tube was named after Comte Jules-Albert de Dion, founder of French automobile manufacturer De Dion-Bouton. The tube, however, was invented around 1894 by co-founder Charles Tr√©pardoux for use on the company's steam tricycles.G.N. Georgano, p. 27. = Advantages and disadvantages = Advantages: #Reduced unsprung weight compared to the Hotchkiss drive (live axle), since the differential and half-shafts are connected to the chassis. #Unlike most fully independent suspension there are no camber changes on axle loading and unloading (or rebound). Fixing the camber of both wheels at 0¬∞ assists in obtaining good traction from wide tires and also tends to reduce wheel hop under high power operations compared to an independent suspension. #The choice of shock absorbers and springs is made easier. #The two wheels may be individually aligned, allowing for independent camber (vertical) and track (horizontal) alignment. Disadvantages: #A pair of CV or universal joints is required for each wheel, adding complexity, cost, and weight. #If coil springs are used, then a lateral location link (usually either a Panhard rod or Watt's linkage) is required, plus additional torque links on each side (five link suspension) or a combination of lower trailing links and an upper transverse wishbone. None of these additional links are required if leaf springs are used, but ride can be compromised due to the leaves having to do double duty as both locating links and springs. The torque links are not required if the setup uses inboard brakes, like in the Pegaso 1502, Rover P6, all Iso carsIso sales literature and Alfa Romeo type 116 (and derivatives), as the wheels do not transmit torque to the suspension. #Sympathetic camber changes on opposite wheels are seen on single-wheel suspension compression, just as in a Hotchkiss drive or live axle.

Other production vehicles using this suspension include the Lancia Aurelia (fourth series onwards) and Flaminia, first and second generation Prince Gloria, the original Mazda Cosmo, Volvo 300-series, Rover P6, Dodge Caravan & Grand Caravan (all wheel drive version from 1991‚Äì2004), DAF 46, DAF 66, all Iso cars (Iso Rivolta IR 300, Iso Grifo, Iso Fidia, Iso Lele) and early Bizzarrini 5300 GT Stradas, some of the largest Opels, such as the Opel Diplomat \\"B\\" of 1969, all Aston Martins from 1967 to 1989, Ferrari 375 and 250TR, first generation Maserati Quattroporte, Bugatti Type 251, Mercedes-Benz W125 and W154 as well as Auto Union Type D. =Recent cars= The Smart Fortwo and Smart Roadster micro-compact cars produced by Daimler AG, Mitsubishi i kei car produced by Mitsubishi Motors and the Caterham 7 (a development of the Lotus Seven after Lotus sold the design rights to Caterham Cars), are the only cars currently in production that utilize this arrangement, as well as the products of some kit car companies. A recent vehicle to use this suspension coupled with leaf springs was the Ford Ranger EV. The American built MV-1 van by VPG also uses this suspension in the rear with leaf springs and is just starting production in spring 2010. 4WD variants of the Honda Fit and Honda HR-V subcompact SUV use a De Dion style suspension in lieu of a torsion beam. Other notable uses Most models of the Kawasaki MULE line of utility vehicles feature a leaf sprung DeDion rear suspension with a distinctively curved tube axle that clears the rear subframe to provide 50mm of wheel travel.Kawasaki MULE 2510/MULE 2520 Utility Vehicle Service Manual Third Edition page 1-6 Benefits include simplicity, durability, compactness and a relatively low liftover height for the cargo bed. Walter Snow Fighter plow trucks produced by the Walter Truck Company of Long Island, New York throughout the mid 20th century used DeDion axles with portal gear hubs for both the front and the rear suspension, allowing the use of large differentials for durability without increasing unsprung weight or reducing ground clearance. Forged steel axles were used instead of tubes. References  Sources  * (reprints AB Nordbok 1985 edition). *Setright, L. J.

It is a combination of ancient Sanskrit theatre with elements of Koothu, an ancient performing art from the Sangam era. It is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Origin Koodiyattam Koodiyattam, meaning \\"combined acting\\" in Malayalam, combines Sanskrit theatre performance with elements of traditional koothu. It is traditionally performed in temple theatres known as koothambalams. It is the only surviving art form that uses drama from ancient Sanskrit theatre. It has a documented history of a thousand years in Kerala, but its origins are not known. Koodiyattam and Chakyar koothu were among the dramatized dance worship services in the temples of ancient India, particularly Kerala. Both koodiyattam and Chakyar koothu originated from the ancient art form koothu, which is mentioned several times in Sangam literature, and the epigraphs of the subsequent Pallava, Pandiyan, Chera, and Chola periods. Inscriptions related to koothu can be seen in temples at Tanjore, Tiruvidaimaruthur, Vedaranyam, Tiruvarur, and Omampuliyur. They were treated as an integral part of worship services, alongside the singing of Tevaram and Prabandam hymns. Ancient kings are among those listed as authors of works for these services. There is evidence of these across the ancient subcontinent during the Chola and Pallava periods. A Pallava king called Rajasimha has been credited with authoring the play Kailasodharanam in Tamil, which has the topic of Ravana becoming subject to Siva's anger and being subdued mercilessly for this. It is believed that Kulasekhara Varman Cheraman Perumal, an ancient king of the Chera dynasty who ruled from Mahodayapuram (modern Kodungallur), reformed koodiyattam, introducing the local language for Vidusaka and structuring the presentation of the play into well-defined units. He himself wrote two plays, Subhadradhananjayam and Tapatisamvarana and made arrangements for their presentation on stage with the help of a Brahmin friend called Tolan. These plays are still performed. Apart from these, the plays traditionally presented include Ascaryacudamani of Saktibhadra, Kalyanasaugandhika of Nilakantha, Bhagavadajjuka of Bodhayana, Nagananda of Harsa, and many plays ascribed to Bhasa, including Abhiseka and Pratima. Koodiyattam performer Kapila Venu  Instruments  200px Traditionally, the main musical instruments used in koodiyattam are the mizhavu, kuzhitalam, edakka, kurumkuzhal, and sankhu. The mizhavu, the most prominent of these, is a percussion instrument that is played by a person of the Ambalavas Nambiar caste, accompanied by Nangyaramma playing the kuzhithalam (a type of cymbal).  Performance style  Koodiyattam Guru 150px Traditionally, koodiyattam has been performed by Chakyars (a subcaste of Kerala Hindus) and by Nangyaramma (women of the Ambalavasi Nambiar caste). The name \\"koodiyattam\\", meaning playing or performing together, is thought to refer to the presence of multiple actors on stage who act in rhythm with the beats of the mizhavu drummers. Alternatively, it may also be a reference to a common practice in Sanskrit drama where a single actor who has performed solo for several nights is joined by another. The main actor is a Chakyar who performs the ritualistic koothu and koodiyattam inside the temple or in the koothambalam. Chakyar women, Illotammas, are not allowed to participate. Instead, the female roles are played by Nangyaramma. Koodiyattam performances are often lengthy and elaborate, ranging from 12 to 150 hours spread across several nights. A complete Koodiyattam performance consists of three parts. The first of these is the purappadu where an actor performs a verse along with the nritta aspect of dance. Following this is the nirvahanam where the actor, using abhinaya, presents the mood of the main character of the play. Then there is the nirvahanam, a retrospective, which takes the audience up to the point where the actual play begins. The final part of the performance is the koodiyattam, which is the play itself. While the first two parts are solo acts, koodiyattam can have as many characters as are required to perform on the stage. The elders of the Chakyar community traditionally taught the artform to their youngsters. It was performed only by Chakyars until the 1950s. In 1955, Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar performed Kutiyattam outside the temple for the first time,* for which he faced many problems from the hardline Chakyar community. In his own words: In 1962, under the leadership of art and Sanskrit scholar V. Raghavan, Sanskrit Ranga of Madras invited Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar to perform koodiyattam in Chennai. Thus for the first time in history koodiyattam was performed outside Kerala. They presented over three nights koodiyattam scenes from the plays Abhi·π£eka, SubhadrƒÅdhana√±jaya and NƒÅgƒÅnda. Koodiyattam face makeup In early 1960s Maria Christoffer Byrski, a Polish student doing research in Indian theatres at Banaras Hindu University, studied koodiyattam with Mani Madhava Chakyar and became the first non-Chakyar/nambiar to learn the art form. He stayed in Guru's home at Killikkurussimangalam and studied in the traditional Gurukula way.

Decline  Koodiyattam traditionally was an exclusive art form performed in special venues called koothambalams in Hindu temples and access to these performances was restricted to only caste Hindus. Also, performances can take up to forty days to complete. The collapse of the feudal order in the nineteenth century in Kerala curtailed the patronage of koodiyattam artists, and they faced serious financial difficulties. Following a revival in the early twentieth century, Koodiyattam is once again facing a lack of funding, leading to a crisis in the profession. UNESCO has called for the creation of a network of koodiyattam institutions and gurukalams to promote the transmission of the art form to future generations and for the development of new audiences besides fostering greater academic research in it. Natanakairali in Irinjalakuda is one of the most prominent institutions in the field of koodiyattam revival. The Margi Theatre Group in Thiruvananthapuram is another organisation dedicated to the revival of kathakali and koodiyattom in Kerala.http://www.margitheatre.org/ Also, Nepathya is an institution promoting koodiyattam and related art forms at Moozhikkulam.http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/koodiyattom-festival- begins-at-moozhikulam/article3702197.ece The Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, has awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest award for performing artists, to kutiyattam artists like Kalamandalam Sivan Namboodiri (2007), Painkulam Raman Chakyar (2010) and Painkulam Damodara Chakyar (2012).

The population details taken at the 2011 census can be found under Worthen. The village was formerly home to a large lead mine. History =Early history= A village was built for workers at the local lead mine - Snailbeach Mine, which reputedly dates back to Roman times. The mine has some of the best preserved surface buildings of a lead mine left standing in Britain including a Cornish Engine House. It is managed by the Shropshire Mines Trust . Snailbeach Mine was the biggest lead mine in Shropshire and it is reputed to have yielded the greatest volume of lead per acre of any mine in Europe. Although the miners mainly extracted lead ore (galena) from the mine, smaller quantities of Barytes, Calcite, Fluorspar, Silver and Zinc were also obtained. =Late 20th century= Underground mining ceased in Snailbeach in 1955. Since 1955 only some reworking of the spoil heaps for spar, to use as pebble dash on buildings, has occurred. Barytes from here was sent to the Windscale nuclear reactor to smother fuel cells after an accident. Locals carried on working the tips until the 1970s. Although some ore is said to have been left standing in the mine, it does not seem likely that the mine will reopen. The old miners were very thorough in their working and rarely left much ore for later generations. Once a mine has been allowed to flood and the machinery removed the cost of reopening the mine increases dramatically and the prospect usually becomes too expensive. Any large amounts of lead remaining in the area are likely to be below the Ritton Castle area. Unfortunately miners would probably have to dig at least 1,000 feet down before they reach the top of the lead deposits, if they could find them. This is too deep and too expensive so lead mining in Shropshire is unlikely to become a major industry ever again. The Shropshire County Council, using government grants, did extensive work in the early 1990s to make some of the shallow workings safe for the villagers. At the same time, they acquired many of the surface buildings and preserved these or restored them from a semi-derelict condition . The white spoil tip on the northern edge of the village, which had been a local landmark, was landscaped and planted with trees as part of the mining reclamation works. Mine tourism The Shropshire Mines Trust manages the mine site on behalf of Shropshire Council, which owns many of the mine buildings and much of the land and gives free access to visit the publicly-owned sites; guided tours can include such features otherwise not accessible. Village Facilities Snailbeach contains a Church of England church, St Luke's, a Methodist Chapel and cemetery, and, a village hall. The latter contains a circular war memorial tablet to the local men who died in the Second World War.

History This symbol has been the coat-of-arms of Munich since the 13th century. The figure portrayed was originally a monk (or friar) holding a book, but by the 16th century it evolved in different portrayals into the figure of a small child wearing a pointed hood, often shown holding a beer mug and a radish. It has been theorized that the name for the city of Munich (M√ºnchen in German) comes from the term or \\"Cloister for Monks\\" due to the Imperial Abbey of Tegernsee--a Benedictine Monastery near which the original town of Munich was built. The image in its different configurations has appeared on countless different objects, from atop the city hall in Munich to manhole covers and even beer steins. The gender of the figure has also changed over the years: from a clearly male, to a gender-neutral child, to a small girl.

In the area of Colli Albani, so even at Albano, presents the phenomenon called TSUE, which is the reduction of water vapour in the clouds as the ground rises. So there will be more rainfall on the foothills of the hills, facing the sea, south southwest, and to the north. Albano, lying on the trajectory of the current wet Tyrrhenian, is fairly rainy with 900‚Äì1000 mm annual precipitation. The winds blow mainly from the south and west, more rarely from the north and east.S. Ciccacci, L. D'Alessandro, L. Davoli, G.B. La Monica, E.

Summer is hot and dry, with a mild and rainy winter with snow quite rarely and only in the presence of a marked generalised cold. In summer, temperatures can reach with peaks of in rare cases. The temperature never reached . Etymology The ruins of the Roman villa of Pompey in Villa Doria Pamphili The name Albano is still a source of debate. In Roman times, the territory of Latium was called Albanum: Albanum (Pompeians Domitiani, etc.).The estate of the wealthy Romans on the Colli Albani (Ager Albanus) and Castra Albana was the name of the camp built by Septimius Severus, within the confines of the fund Albanum previously owned by Domitian, to accommodate the Legio II Parthica. This place-name hypothesis is considered the most reliable as the root of these ties in Indo-European * alb / * alp indicating a high location, the Mons Albanus (now Monte Cavo) in this case, while it was the centre of worship and common pasture (compascuo). Other assumptions, however, considered valid are the Latin place-name adjective albus (‚Äúwhite\\") or Greek Œ±ŒªŒ±Œ≤Œ± (‚Äúash\\"). Etymologically proposed Albanum / Castra Albana is the same as being proposed for Alba Longa, whose location is not known with certainty, but placed in a medieval tradition of urban core areas of modern Albano Laziale . The second part of the Latium name of was used in 1873 to distinguish the city from Albano Sant'Alessandro (Bergamo), Albano Vercellese (Vercelli province) and Albano di Lucania (Potenza province). History =Ancient age = The first recorded evidence of human settlement in the town of Albano Laziale dates from the beginning of the first millennium BC with the remains of settlements of Tor Paluzzi, Castel Savelli and Colle dei Cappuccini.Pino Chiarucci, \\"La Civilt√† Laziale e gli insediamenti albani in particolare\\", in Pino Chiarucci (editor), Il Lazio Antico ‚Äì Corso di Archeologia tenutosi presso il Museo Civico di Albano 1982-1983, p. 35. The human presence in these locations, is maintained even in later times, while from Laziale IIB period (830 BCE ‚Äì 730 BCE) start to appear due to traces of the mythical foundation Latin capital of Alba Longa.Pino Chiarucci, \\"La Civilt√† Laziale e gli insediamenti albani in particolare\\", in Pino Chiarucci (editor), Il Lazio Antico ‚Äì Corso di Archeologia tenutosi presso il Museo Civico di Albano 1982-1983, p. 39. Most modern historians seems inclined to place the site of Alba Longa in between the towns of Marino, Rocca di Papa and Ariccia on the eastern side of Lake Albano, which is opposite to the present city of Albano. The ancient Roman baths of Cellomaio in Albano. Albano is located in the area in which, according to the legend, Aeneas's son, Ascanius, founded Alba Longa. Today the coat of arms of Albano still sports the white (Latin: Alba) boar dreamed of by Ascanius before the founding of the city. Alba Longa was one of the main cities of the Latins and, again according to the legend, the birthplace of Romulus and Remus, the mythical founders of Rome. Albanense in the territory, were then subjected to a large extent the wealthy of Aricia, which built several suburban villas built by the leading exponents of the Roman nobility. Pompey had a villa, the Albanum Pompeii, whose ruins have been found inside of the Villa Doria Pamphili. A villa belonging to the Seneca would be identified within the ruins found on the south ridge of Lake Albano, bordering the town of Ariccia. All of these residences, at the time of Emperor Domitian were combined into a single fund owned by the Emperor's Albanum Cesaris, within which erected a monumental imperial residence, with the ruins mostly contained in the Villa Barberini at Castel Gandolfo.Girolamo Torquati, Studi storico-archeologici sulla citt√† e sul territorio di Marino, vol. I, capp. II‚ÄìX. The Emperor Septimius Severus around 202 had installed in place of the old town of the Legio II Parthica. Thus were born the Castra Albana, which were huge camps that remained in operation until the end of 3rd century. Albano developed from this settlement, as is shown by the main streets, which still follow the ancient decumanus and cardo. Remains of the large baths built by Septimius' son, Caracalla, are still visible. = Middle Ages and early Modern era (476-1699)= The Cathedral of San Pancrazio. In 326, Emperor Constantine I, according to an established tradition, ordered the founding of the Albanense cathedral dedicated to St. John the Baptist. According to sources, Constantine donated to the newly formed cathedral, various sacred vessels and several estates and funds in Ager Albanus. During the Gothic War, Albano was reduced from municipium to oppidulum, a small fortified city.Riccy, Memorie storiche dell'antichissima Alba-Longa e dell'Albano moderna. In 964, Emperor Otto I conferred the investiture at Albano to Virginio Savelli, his captain in Rome. Pope Paschal II in 1118 took refuge in Albano as a hostile insurgency occupied Rome, and found that Albanensi loyalty be granted perpetual exemption from taxes of milling wheat.Il testo del decretale di esenzione, riportato su marmo dagli albanensi, era fino al 1719 incastonato sopra la porta della Cattedrale di San Pancrazio, ma poi venne spostato nall'interno della chiesa presso il battistero. During the schism of anti-pope Anacletus with Pope Innocent II in 1137 the anti-pope marched on Lazio Albano and other locations to extend its domain, but these territories were taken over by Innocent II. In the Year 1142, Albano was sacked by the Saracens. After the Battle of Monte Porzio, in 1168, the Roman people thought it well to take revenge on Albano, who had sided with the city 's Emperor Frederick Barbarossa against Rome, and so the town was looted and razed. Given the state of abandonment, Pope Innocent III gave the monastery of St. Paul Outside the Walls the Palatium with the churches of Santa Maria Minor and St. Nicholas and their dependencies. In 1436 it was razed along with Castel Savelli by Cardinal Giovanni Maria Vitelleschi, by order of Pope Eugenius IV. In 1697 Albano switched to direct control of the Holy See.Collocate, secondo il Lugli, nei vomitoria dell'anfiteatro romano. =Feudal era (1699-1798)= Pope Pius VI in 1780 began the rearrangement of the Via Appia, to achieve a fast link between Rome and Terracina, where there was intense work on the reclamation of the Pontine Marshes. The first route of the new \\"National Road\\" arrived to follow the Via Appia Antica, only to stray from the path along the ridge of ancient Vallericcia to arrive at Genzano, avoiding the sharp uphill to reach Ariccia. Only with the construction of the Ariccia bridge under the pontificates of Pope Gregory XVI and Pius IX (1839‚Äì1849) will outline the current route of State Road 7 Via Appia. The opening of the new route of the Via Appia undoubted benefited Albano and locations along its course.Giovanni Antonio Ricci, Memorie storiche dell'antichisima citt√† di Alba Longa e dell'Albano moderno, libro III, capo VIII pp. 254-255. During the first French occupation and the events tied to the French Revolution in the Papal States, on February 18, 1798 Albano, along with Frascati, Velletri and later Marino, proclaimed itself a \\"sister republic\\" to the nascent Roman Republic. Following the uprising the Albanensi rebelled against the French, Albano was occupied and looted by the troops of Murat. The following year, however, at Albano, installs Fra Diavolo, commanding Neapolitan column.Giuseppe Del Pinto, Albano nel 1798, p. 14. =Contemporary era (1798-1944)= 200px With the motu proprio of July 6, 1816, by Pope Pius VI elevated Albano back in the Papal States with the Restoration of the Government seat.

His original personal name was Zhao Yong but he changed it to \\"Zhao Xu\\" after his coronation. He reigned from 1085 until his death in 1100, and was succeeded by his younger half-brother, Emperor Huizong, because his son died prematurely. Emperor Zhezong was the sixth son of Emperor Shenzong. He ascended the throne at the age of nine under the supervision of his grandmother, Grand Empress Dowager Gao.  Reign  As the young emperor's regent, Grand Empress Dowager Gao appointed conservatives such as Sima Guang as Chancellor, who halted the New Policies set forth by Wang Anshi before dying in 1086. Emperor Zhezong was powerless and it was not until Grand Empress Dowager Gao's death in 1093 that the emperor was able to reinstate Wang Anshi's reforms and reduce the late Sima Guang's influence. Emperor Zhezong lowered taxes, stopped negotiations with the Tangut-led Western Xia state, and resumed armed conflict which eventually forced Western Xia to enter a more peaceful stance with the Song Empire. However, Emperor Zhezong was unable to stop fighting between conservative members of his government and the more liberal members who supported Wang Anshi's reforms and in fact, the fighting intensified during Emperor Zhezong's reign. This split would eventually contribute to the Northern Song dynasty's demise in the 12th century. On May 18, 1099, Zhezong became ill in which the symptoms were constant coughing and constipation. Zhezong did not get any better, even though he had taken many medications and so Zhezong asked his councilors to recommend physicians. Geng Yu, an physician who was recommended advised Zhezong and even though Zhezong followed his directions, there were no signs of him getting better. On July, his constipation was replaced by severe diarrhea and Zhezong could not get up from his bed to receive medicine. Geng recommended spleen-warming pills, an action Zhezong's mother supported. The coolness of the weather improved Zhezong's health; making him well enough to attend the celebration of his son Zhao Mao on August 8. But his illness returned so Zhezong cancelled his audiences for two days. When he saw his councillors on August 14, he told them that Geng gave him medicine to induce vomiting. He was slightly better but his appetite was gone and his belly constantly ached. Zhezong attended the banquet in honor of his son, in which he was in a very good mood and that his younger brother Zhao Ji also attended. However, Zhao Mao became sick. Zhezong, now in a bad mood due to his son's illness told his councillors that the royal doctors were treating Zhao Mao. On September 26, Zhao Mao was getting better but soon died making Zhezong cancelling his audiences for three days. His birthday was a great celebration but was cut short when after the birthday party, he fell ill and was vomiting all day long. He also contracted laryngitis and could only speak with great effort. By December 21, Zhezong was close to death; he had a weak pulse. Emperor Zhezong died on February 23, 1100 in Kaifeng at the age of 23 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Emperor Huizong.

Biography Engle was born in Syracuse, New York into Quaker family and went on to graduate from Williams College with a B.S. in physics. He earned an M.S. in physics and a Ph.D. in economics, both from Cornell University in 1966 and 1969 respectively.Homepage at New York University After completing his Ph.D., Engle became Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1969 to 1977.MIT Nobel laureates He joined the faculty of the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1975, wherefrom he retired in 2003. He now holds positions of Professor Emeritus and Research Professor at UCSD. He currently teaches at New York University, Stern School of Business where he is the Michael Armellino professor in Management of Financial Services. At New York University, Engle teaches for the Master of Science in Risk Management Program for Executives, which is offered in partnership with the Amsterdam Institute of Finance. Engle's most important contribution was his path-breaking discovery of a method for analyzing unpredictable movements in financial market prices and interest rates. Accurate characterization and prediction of these volatile movements are essential for quantifying and effectively managing risk. For example, risk measurement plays a key role in pricing options and financial derivatives. Previous researchers had either assumed constant volatility or had used simple devices to approximate it. Engle developed new statistical models of volatility that captured the tendency of stock prices and other financial variables to move between high volatility and low volatility periods (\\"Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity: ARCH\\").

The NMA is a 501 (c) (3) national professional and scientific organization representing the interests of more than 30,000 African American physicians and the patients they serve, with nearly 112 affiliated societies throughout the nation and U.S. territories. The National Medical Association has been firmly established in a leadership role in medicine. The NMA is committed to improving the quality of health among minorities and disadvantaged people through its membership, professional development, community health education, advocacy, research and partnerships with federal and private agencies. Throughout its history the National Medical Association has focused primarily on health issues related to African Americans and medically underserved populations; however, its principles, goals, initiatives, and philosophy encompass all ethnic groups. History, 1900-1960 During the Jim Crow era in the southern part of the United States, state laws and social customs mandated the racial segregation of medical societies, medical facilities, and medical education. The NMA was organized by twelve black doctors attending the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, Georgia. The first president was Robert F. Boyd, and Daniel Hale Williams served as the vice president. = National health insurance = The NMA, dedicated to promoting the interests of those of \\"African Descent,\\" contributed to the national health insurance dialogue from 1900-1950. Despite its rather marginal size, starting in the mid-1910s, the NMA advocated compulsory health insurance. Primarily, the association sought any means that provided medical care for African Americans. As an association, however, it also sought to promote the interests of the African American physician him/herself. From the mid-1910s to the late 1940s, the American Medical Association (AMA) acted as the mainstream medical profession's voice. Yet numerous African American doctors were unable to join the AMA due to the lack of county medical societies and/or because of local bigoted practices, thereby limiting the number of African American AMA members. To exacerbate matters further, the NMA's leadership continued to support compulsory health insurance while AMA members largely distanced itself from such a scheme due to (a) the red scare, (b) the belief in U.S. health superiority to other nations with national health insurance schemes and (c) the argument that a national health insurance would potentially ruin the \\"sacred\\" practitioner-patient relationship. Struggling between providing medical care for African Americans as well as maintaining the voice of African American physicians, the NMA was internally divided on these issues from the late 1930s-early 1950s. During this time period, the NMA leadership repeatedly stated their support for a national health insurance scheme through the Journal of the National Medical Association as well as newspapers like the Chicago Defender. At the same time, rank-and-file members, desirous to practice medicine, supported the AMA's proposals. Indeed, during the height of the health insurance debates from 1946‚Äì50, the AMA often sent guest speakers to the NMA's conferences. Such AMA officials promised the NMA membership in their ranks as well as the right to practice medicine. Yet the NMA's leadership largely resisted the AMA's efforts. NMA presidents like Drs. E. L. Robinson, C. Austin Whitter and J. G. Gathings opposed the AMA's proposals on the grounds that the AMA had previously excluded African American patients from their care as well as African American physicians from their ranks. Furthermore, the AMA's support of Abraham Flexner's Report of 1910 witnessed the closure of numerous African American and women's hospitals across the country. How could, the NMA leadership argued, African American doctors support the AMA when the AMA was, in fact, the origin of some of African American's most severe issues (indeed, NMA member Dr. Cobb compared the AMA's tactics to the KKK during 1946-50). By the early 1950s, the NMA still did not possess a consensual platform concerning health insurance. Internally torn about the best methods to promote their own professional ambitions as well as the interests of African American patients, the health insurance topic remained a divisive one. Still, members of the NMA offered resistance to the AMA's promotion of voluntary health insurance when few medical practitioners dared to. In the late 1950s, the NMA took a more active interest in civil rights under the leadership of its president, T. R. M. Howard, a surgeon from Mississippi. In the months after his election as president, Howard had played a key role in the search for evidence and witnesses in the Emmett Till murder case and led the largest civil rights organization in the state, the Regional Council of Negro Leadership. In 1957, under his leadership, the NMA organized the Imhotep National Conference on Hospital Integration which publicized and challenged continuing hospital segregation in both the North and South.History National Medical Association retrieved 2017-10-09 NMA Convention and Scientific Assembly Nearly every year since its founding in 1895, the NMA has held the Annual Convention & Scientific Assembly, which is regarded as the nation‚Äôs foremost forum on medical science and African American health.

The original production starred Ray Middleton and Nanette Fabray, was directed by Elia Kazan, and choreographed by Michael Kidd. The show told the story of a married couple, Sam and Susan Cooper, who never age as they progress from 1791 to 1948, encountering difficulties in their marriage (and thus the very fabric of marriage) as they struggle to cope with changing social mores. One of the earliest examples of the concept musical, the action of Love Life was interspersed with vaudeville-style numbers that commented on the story, in a way very similar to Cabaret (which opened in 1966).

On July 20, 2015, it merged with the Charleston Gazette to form the Charleston Gazette-Mail. Publishing history The Daily Mail was founded in 1914 by former Alaska Governor Walter Eli Clark and remained the property of his heirs until 1987. Governor Clark described the newspaper as an \\"independent Republican\\" publication. The newspaper published in the afternoons, Monday‚ÄìSaturday, with a Sunday morning edition, until 1961, when the paper entered into a Joint Operating Agreement with the morning Charleston Gazette and the new Sunday Charleston Gazette-Mail was substituted and the Daily Mail began a six-day afternoon publishing schedule. In 1987, the Clark heirs sold the paper to the Toronto-based Thomson Newspapers. The new owners moderated the political views of the paper to some degree. In 1998, Thomson sold the Daily Mail to the Denver-based MediaNews Group. In May 2004, MediaNews sold the paper to the Daily Gazette Company, the owners of the morning newspaper. The new owner reduced the staff and canceled its Saturday edition, publishing Monday‚ÄìFriday afternoons from 2004 to 2009. It also began to market the paper in an uncompetitive manner in an attempt to drive its circulation down to the point it could be closed. The United States Department of Justice filed suit under antitrust laws almost immediately. In the course of the lawsuit it was discovered that the Daily Gazette Company had presented a business plan to the United Bank which projected a shutdown of the paper no later than 2007. In January 2009, the paper was switched to a morning publication. On January 20, 2010, the Daily Gazette Company and the Justice Department settled relative to violations in the purchase of the Daily Mail and the Daily Gazette Company's management of it. Under the announced terms of the settlement, the previous owner, the Media News Group, held a perpetual option to re-purchase 20% of the paper, had two of five seats on the management board, and determined the size of the budget for its news staff and choose its editorial content. The Daily Gazette was required to seek government permission to cease publication of the Daily Mail and the intellectual property of the paper passed to the Media News Group when it shut down. This intellectual property once included the domain name dailymail.com which the newspaper beat the larger London paper in registering in 1996, but in January 2014 it was reported that the British company had paid over ¬£1m (US$1.7m) for the domain name for its Mail Online service. The newspaper was merged with the Charleston Gazette, without prior notice on July 20, 2015, to form the Charleston Gazette-Mail.  Awards  The Daily Mail has won awards in many fields. J. D. Maurice, its editor of many years until his retirement in 1978, won the Sigma Delta Chi Award for editorial writing in 1958 and the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished editorial writing in 1975.

Pyrosequencing relies on light detection based on a chain reaction when pyrophosphate is released. Hence, the name pyrosequencing. The principle of Pyrosequencing was first described in 1993Nyren, Petersson and Uhlen (1993) ‚ÄúSolid Phase DNA Minisequencing by an Enzymatic Luminometric Inorganic Pyrophosphate Detection Assay‚Äù Analytical Biochemistry 208 (1), 171-175, https://doi.org/10.1006/abio.1993.1024 by Bertil Pettersson, Mathias Uhlen and P√•l Nyren by combining the solid phase sequencing methodUhlen (1989) ‚ÄùMagnetic separation of DNA‚Äù Nature 340: 733-4, https://doi.org/10.1038/340733a0 using streptavidin coated magnetic beads with recombinant DNA polymerase lacking 3¬¥to 5¬¥exonuclease activity (proof-reading) and luminescence detection using the firefly luciferase enzyme.Nyren and Lundin (1985) ‚ÄúEnzymatic method for continuous monitoring of inorganic pyrophosphate synthesis‚Äù Analytiocal Biochemistry 151 (2): 504-509. https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-2697(85)90211-8 A mixture of three enzymes (DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase and firefly luciferase) and a nucleotide (dNTP) are added to single stranded DNA to be sequenced and the incorporation of nucleotide is followed by measuring the light emitted. The intensity of the light determines if 0, 1 or more nucleotides have been incorporated, thus showing how many complementary nucleotides are present on the template strand. The nucleotide mixture is removed before the next nucleotide mixture is added. This process is repeated with each of the four nucleotides until the DNA sequence of the single stranded template is determined. A second solution-based method for Pyrosequencing was described in 1998Ronaghi, Uhl√©n and Nyr√©n (1998) ‚ÄùA sequenbcing method based on real-time pyrophosphate‚Äù Science. 281 (5375): 363. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.281.5375.363 . by Mostafa Ronaghi, Mathias Uhlen and P√•l Nyren. In this alternative method, an additional enzyme apyrase is introduced to remove nucleotides that are not incorporated by the DNA polymerase. This enabled the enzyme mixture including the DNA polymerase, the luciferase and the apyrase to be added at the start and kept throughout the procedure, thus providing a simple set-up suitable for automation. An automated instrument based on this principle was introduced to the market the following year by the company Pyrosequencing. A third microfluidic variant of the Pyrosequencing method was described in 2005Marguiles et al (2005) ‚ÄúGenome sequencing in microfabricated high-density picolitre reactors‚Äù Nature 437, 376-380. https://doi.org/doi:10.1038/nature03959; by Jonathan Rothberg and co- workers at the company 454 Life Sciences. This alternative approach for Pyrosequencing was based on the original principle of attaching the DNA to be sequenced to a solid support and they showed that sequencing could be performed in a highly parallel manner using a microfabricated microarray. This allowed for high-throughput DNA sequencing and an automated instrument was introduced to the market. This became the first next generation sequencing instrument starting a new era in genomics research, with rapidly falling prices for DNA sequencing allowing whole genome sequencing at affordable prices. Procedure  The chart shows how pyrosequencing works. \\"Sequencing by synthesis\\" involves taking a single strand of the DNA to be sequenced and then synthesizing its complementary strand enzymatically. The pyrosequencing method is based on detecting the activity of DNA polymerase (a DNA synthesizing enzyme) with another chemoluminescent enzyme. Essentially, the method allows sequencing a single strand of DNA by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step. The template DNA is immobile, and solutions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides are sequentially added and removed from the reaction. Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template. The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template. For the solution-based version of Pyrosequencing, the single-strand DNA (ssDNA) template is hybridized to a sequencing primer and incubated with the enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase and apyrase, and with the substrates adenosine 5¬¥ phosphosulfate (APS) and luciferin. # The addition of one of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) (dATPŒ±S, which is not a substrate for a luciferase, is added instead of dATP to avoid noise) initiates the second step. DNA polymerase incorporates the correct, complementary dNTPs onto the template. This incorporation releases pyrophosphate (PPi). # ATP sulfurylase converts PPi to ATP in the presence of adenosine 5¬¥ phosphosulfate. This ATP acts as a substrate for the luciferase-mediated conversion of luciferin to oxyluciferin that generates visible light in amounts that are proportional to the amount. The light produced in the luciferase-catalyzed reaction is detected by a camera and analyzed in a program. # Unincorporated nucleotides and ATP are degraded by the apyrase, and the reaction can restart with another nucleotide. PPi + APS ‚Üí ATP + Sulfate (catalyzed by ATP-sulfurylase) ATP + luciferin + O2 ‚Üí AMP + PPi + oxyluciferin \\\\+ CO2 + (hv) (catalyzed by luciferase) where APS is adenosine 5-phosphosulfate. AMP is adenosine monophosphate. CO2 is carbon dioxide. hv is light. O2 is oxygen molecule. Limitations Currently, a limitation of the method is that the lengths of individual reads of DNA sequence are in the neighborhood of 300-500 nucleotides, shorter than the 800-1000 obtainable with chain termination methods (e.g. Sanger sequencing). This can make the process of genome assembly more difficult, particularly for sequences containing a large amount of repetitive DNA. Lack of proof-reading activity limits accuracy of this method. Commercialization The company Pyrosequencing AB in Uppsala, Sweden was founded with venture capital provided by HealthCap in order to commercialize machinery and reagents for sequencing short stretches of DNA using the pyrosequencing technique. Pyrosequencing AB was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1999. It was renamed to Biotage in 2003. The pyrosequencing business line was acquired by Qiagen in 2008. Pyrosequencing technology was further licensed to 454 Life Sciences. 454 developed an array- based pyrosequencing technology which emerged as a platform for large-scale DNA sequencing, including genome sequencing and metagenomics. Roche announced the discontinuation of the 454 sequencing platform in 2013 when its technology became noncompetitive.

Etymology The word tlahuelpuchi derives from the Nahuatl tlƒÅhuihpochtli (plural tlƒÅtlƒÅhuihpochtin), a compound of tlƒÅhuia, \\"to light up or illuminate\\" and p≈çchtli, which can mean \\"haze\\", \\"left\\", \\"southern\\" or \\"youth\\" (as in compounds like tƒìlp≈çchtli, young man). As a result, tlahuelpuchi may mean glowing haze or illuminated youth.Mart√≠nez Gonz√°lez (2006) Description The tlahuelpuchi is a type of vampire or witch that lives with its human family. It is able to shape shift and sucks the blood of infants at night. It has a kind of glowing aura when shape shifted. Tlahuelpuchi are born with their curse and cannot avoid it. They first learn of what they are sometime around puberty. Most tlahuelpuchi are female and the female tlahuelpuchi are more powerful than males. The tlahuelpuchi have a form of society. Typically they each have their own territories. They also have a pact with shamans and other supernatural creatures; a shaman won't turn in a suspected tlahuelpuchi. The typical sign that a victim was killed by the tlahuelpuchi are bruises on their upper body. The Tlahuelpuchi largely feeds on children, though it can kill others. Powers Tlahuelpuchi are able to change form by detaching their body from their legs (which are left in the house of the witch). They then go hunting, usually in the form of some bird like a turkey or a vulture. The tlahuelpuchi has to perform a ritual before she can enter the house of a victim. The tlahuelpuchi must fly over the house in the shape of a cross from north to south, east to west.Bowles (2012) Weaknesses Tlahuelpuchi must feed at least once a month on blood or they die. Their victim of choice is an infant. There is no way to detect a tlahuelpuchi except by catching them in the act. Their family protects them out of shame and because if a family member is responsible for the death of a tlahuelpuchi the curse will be passed down to them. The curse cannot be lifted, and if a tlahuelpuchi is identified, they must be killed on the spot. Garlic, onions and metal repel the tlahuelpuchi.

He later served as the deputy Adjutant General for the Continental Army for South Carolina and Georgia. Eveleigh was elected to the South Carolina State House of Representatives in 1781. Later that year, they sent him as one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. In 1782, he returned home and served as a member of the state's council (later called the state senate). He left public service for a time, and worked to improve his plantation. In 1789 Eveleigh became the first Comptroller of the United States Treasury, under President George Washington. He died in office in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on April 16, 1791. Washington appointed Oliver Wolcott, Jr. to replace him. Eveleigh and his wife, Mary, had no children. She survived him and later remarried, to become the second wife of widower Edward Rutledge.

An oversight allowed Sveinson to continue with his oral questioning preventing an orderly closure to question period thus stopping the business of the house. The rules allowed question period to continue indefinitely. The purpose was to force the government to settle with constituents who had financial promises from the provincial government unfulfilled. Sveinson continued to sit as an independent MLA until he joined the Western Canada Concept Party of Saskatchewan in 1986. The WCC had no members in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan at that time. The WCC advocated the separation from Canada of the four western provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba). He subsequently convinced Progressive Conservative MLA, Lloyd Hampton to join him in Opposition. This gave the WCC two seats in the legislature, enough to receive official party standing, and therefore a research budget paid for by the Legislature. Official party status gave the two members research funding to provide effective opposition. Subsequently, the rules were changed to prevent future use of this tactic. The WCC was split over whether to accept the two new members: the party leader supported accepting them, while the party president was opposed. After a few months, Sveinson and Hampton were expelled from the party. His political tenure ended with the 1986 provincial election.

Noted as a prodigy by his contemporaries, he gained the title kalikƒÅlasarvaj√±a, \\"the knower of all knowledge in his times\\". Early life Hemachandra was born in Dhandhuka, in present-day Gujarat, on Kartika Sud Purnima (the full moon day of Kartika month). His date of birth differs according to sources but 1088 is generally accepted.The dates of birth and death differs according to sources. He was initiated at age of 21. His father, Chachiga-deva was a Modh Bania Vaishnava. His mother, Pahini, was a Jain. Hemchandra's original given name was Changadeva. In his childhood, the Jain monk Devachandra Suri visited Dhandhuka and was impressed by the young Hemachandra's intellect. His mother and maternal uncle concurred with Devachandra, in opposition to his father, that Hemachandra be a disciple of his. Devachandra took Hemachandra to Khambhat, where Hemachandra was placed under the care of the local governor Udayana. Chachiga came to Udayana's place to take his son back, but was so overwhelmed by the kind treatment he received, that he decided to willingly leave his son with Devachandra. Some years later, Hemachandra was initiated a Jain monk on Magha Sud Chauth (4th day of the bright half of Magha month) and was given a new name, Somchandra. Udayana helped Devchandra Suri in the ceremony. He was trained in religious discourse, philosophy, logic and grammar and became well versed in Jain and non‚ÄìJain scriptures. At the age of 21, he was ordained an acharya of the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara school of Jainism at Nagaur in present-day Rajasthan. At this time, he was named Hemachandra Suri. Hemachandra and Siddharaja Bust of Hemachandra at Hemchandracharya North Gujarat University At the time, Gujarat was ruled by the Chaulukya dynasty from Anhilavada (Patan). It is not certain when Hemachandra visited Patan for the first time. As Jain monks are mendicants for eight months and stay at one place during Chaturmas, the four monsoon months, he started living at Patan during these periods and produced the majority of his works there. Probably around 1125, he was introduced to the Jayasimha Siddharaja (fl. 1092‚Äì1141) and soon rose to prominence in the Chaulukya royal court. According to the Prabhavakacarita of PrabhƒÅcandra, the earliest biography of Hemachandra, Jayasimha spotted Hemachandra while passing through the streets of his capital. The king was impressed with an impromptu verse uttered by the young monk. In 1135, when the Siddharaja conquered Malwa, he brought the works of Bhoja from Dhar along with other things. One day Siddhraja came across the manuscript of Sarasvati-Kanthabharana (also known as the Lakshana Prakash), a treatise on Sanskrit grammar. He was so impressed by it that he told the scholars in his court to produce a grammar that was as easy and lucid. Hemachandra requested Siddharaja to find the eight best grammatical treatises from Kashmir. He studied them and produced a new grammar work in the style of PƒÅ·πáini's A·π£·π≠ƒÅdhyƒÅyƒ´. He named his work Siddha-Hema- ≈öabdanu≈õƒÅ≈õana after himself and the king. Siddharaja was so pleased with the work that he ordered it to be placed on the back of an elephant and paraded through the streets of Anhilwad Patan. Hemachandra also composed the Dvyashraya Kavya, an epic on the history of the Chaulukya dynasty, to illustrate his grammar. Hemachandra and Kumarapala Idol of Hemachandra at Jain Center of New Jersey, US According to the Prabhachandra, there was an incident where Siddharaja wanted to kill his nephew Kumarapala because it was prophesied that the kingdom would meet its demise at Kumarapala's hands. Hemachandra hid Kumarapala under a pile of manuscripts to save him. However, such motifs are common in Indian folk literature, so it is unlikely it was an actual historical event. Also, many sources differ on Siddharaja's motives. Hemachandra became the advisor to Kumarapala. During Kumarapala's reign, Gujarat became a center of culture. Using the Jain approach of Anekantavada, Hemchandra is said to have displayed a broad-minded attitude, which pleased Kumarapala. Kumarapala was a Shaiva and ordered the rebuilding of Somnath at Prabhas Patan. Some people who were jealous of Hemachandra's rising popularity with the Kumarapala complained that Hemachandra was a very arrogant person, that he did not respect the devas and that he refused to bow down to Shiva. When called upon to visit the temple on the inauguration with Kumarapala, Hemachandra readily bowed before the lingam but said: Ultimately, the king became a devoted follower of Hemachandra and a champion of Jainism. Starting in 1121, Hemachandra was involved in the construction of the Jain temple at Taranga. His influence on Kumarapala resulted in Jainism becoming the official religion of Gujarat and animal slaughter was banned in the state. The tradition of animal sacrifice in the name of religion was completely uprooted in Gujarat. As a result, even almost 900 years after Hemchandra, Gujarat still continues to be a predominantly lacto-vegetarian state, despite having an extensive coastline. Death He announced about his death six months in advance and fasted in his last days, a Jain practice called sallekhana. He died at Anhilavad Patan. The year of death differs according to sources but 1173 is generally accepted. Works A prodigious writer, Hemachandra wrote grammars of Sanskrit and Prakrit, poetry, prosody, lexicons, texts on science and logic and many branches of Indian philosophy. It is said that Hemachandra composed 3.5 crore verses in total, many of which are now lost. =Jain philosophy= A 12th-century manuscript of Hemachandra's Yogasastra in Sanskrit. The text is notable for using 1 mm miniaturized Devanagari script. His systematic exposition of the Jain path in the Yoga≈õƒÅstra and its auto- commentary is a very influential text in Jain thought. According to Olle Quarnstr√∂m it is \\"the most comprehensive treatise on Svetambara Jainism known to us\\".Olle Quarnstr√∂m, The Yogasastra of Hemacandra : a twelfth century handbook of Svetambara Jainism, 2002, introduction =Grammar= Hemachandra's grammar text Siddhahemashabdanushasana in Sanskrit This Sanskrit grammar was written in the style of PƒÅ·πáini. It has seven chapters with each chapter having four sections, similar to that of the grammar of Bhoja. The Siddha-Hema- ≈öabdanu≈õƒÅ≈õana also includes six Prakrit languages: the \\"standard\\" Prakrit (virtually Maharashtri Prakrit), Shauraseni, Magahi, Pai≈õƒÅcƒ´, the otherwise- unattested C≈´likƒÅpai≈õƒÅcƒ´ and Apabhra·πÉ≈õa (virtually Gurjar Apabhra·πÉ≈õa, prevalent in the area of Gujarat and Rajasthan at that time and the precursor of Gujarati language). He gave a detailed grammar of Apabhra·πÉ≈õa and also illustrated it with the folk literature of the time for better understanding. It is the only known Apabhra·πÉ≈õa grammar. =Poetry= Worship of Parshvanatha, Folio from the Siddhahemashabdanushasana To illustrate the grammar, he produced the epic poetry Dvyashraya Kavya on the history of Chaulukya dynasty. It is an important source of history of region of the time. The epic poem Trƒ´·π£a·π£·π≠i≈õalƒÅkƒÅpuru·π£acharitra or \\"Lives of Sixty-Three Great Men\\" is a hagiographical treatment of the twenty four tirthankaras and other important persons instrumental in defining the Jain philosophical position, collectively called the \\"≈õalƒÅkƒÅpuru·π£a\\", their asceticism and eventual liberation from the cycle of death and rebirth, as well as the legendary spread of the Jain influence. It still serves as the standard synthesis of source material for the early history of Jainism. The appendix to this work, the Pari≈õi·π£·π≠aparvan or SthavirƒÅvalƒ´carita, contains his own commentary and is in itself a treatise of considerable depth It has been translated into English as The Lives of the Jain Elders. In the test, Hemchandra accepts the polyandry of Draupadi and further suggests that Draupadi was Nagasri in one of his previous lives and had poisoned a Jain monk. Therefore she had to suffer in hell and animal incarnations for several lives before being born as woman who later became a Jain nun. After her death, she was reborn as Draupadi and was married to five pandavas. His Kavyanuprakasha follows the model of Kashmiri rhetorician Mammata's Kavya-prakasha. He quoted other scholars like Anandavardhana and Abhinavagupta in his works. =Lexicography = Abhidhan-Chintamani (IAST abhidhƒÅna-cintƒÅma·πái-ko≈õa) is a lexicon while Anekarth Kosha is a lexicon of words bearing multiple meanings. Deshi-Shabda-Sangraho or Desi-nama-mala is the lexicon of local or non-Sanskrit origin. Niganthu Sesa is a botanical lexicon. =Prosody= He composed the Chandonushasana, a work on prosody, with commentary. =Mathematics= Thirteen ways of arranging long and short syllables in a cadence of length six, here shown with Cuisenaire rods of length 1cm and 2cm Hemachandra, following the earlier Gopala, described the Fibonacci sequence in around 1150, about fifty years before Fibonacci (1202). He was considering the number of cadences of length n, and showed that these could be formed by adding a short syllable to a cadence of length n ‚àí 1, or a long syllable to one of n ‚àí 2\\\\. This recursion relation F(n) = F(n ‚àí 1) + F(n ‚àí 2) is what defines the Fibonacci sequence. He (c. 1150 AD) studied the rhythms of Sanskrit poetry. Syllables in Sanskrit are either long or short. Long syllables have twice the length of short syllables. The question he asked is How many rhythm patterns with a given total length can be formed from short and long syllables? For example, how many patterns have the length of five short syllables (i.e. five ‚Äúbeats‚Äù)? There are eight: SSSSS, SSSL, SSLS, SLSS, LSSS, SLL, LSL, LLS As rhythm patterns, these are xxxxx, xxxx., xxx.x, xx.xx, x.xxx, xx.x., x.xx., x.x.x http://people.sju.edu/~rhall/Multi/rhythm2.pdf =Other works= His other works are a commentary in rhetoric work Alankara Chudamani, Abhidhana-chintamani,Olle Quarnstr√∂m (2002), The Yoga≈õƒÅstra of Hemacandra: A Twelfth Century Handbook of ≈övetƒÅmbara Jainism, Harvard University Press, Pramana-mimansa (logic), Vitaraga-Stotra (prayers).

He first tries to stop the war after meeting a young German sniper of the same name, who believes that the soldiers must unite. However, the commanders of the allied forces intend to use the discontent with the war among the German soldiers as a perfect time to advance in the war.

Meanwhile, Johnny finds himself committed to an asylum for ten years.

Gruppe SPUR was an artistic collaboration formed by the German painters Heimrad Prem, Helmut Sturm and Hans-Peter Zimmer and the sculptor Lothar Fischer in 1957. They published a journal of the same name Spur. They were the first German artistic group in decades to manifest a freedom of investigation with international relevance, recognized as an equal by the cultural avant-garde of several different countries, pursuing real artistic experiments of their time. By contrast, the German cultural landscape of then was characterized by a total cultural void and by \\"the dullest conformism, in which the artists and intellectuals being honored were only retarded and timid imitators of imported, old ideas.\\" For this, and possibly other criticisms, the Spur journal was subject to police and judicial prosecutions, and was convicted \\"in the name of moral order\\", in order to make the Spur group, and all those who wish to pursue the same route, succumb to the ambient conformism. The Spur group joined and collaborated with the Situationist International, a restricted group of international revolutionaries, between 1959 and 1961. After a series of core divergences during 1960‚Äì1, the Spur members were officially excluded from the SI on February 10, 1962. The events that led to the exclusion were: during the Fourth SI Conference in London (December 1960), in a discussion about the political nature of the SI, Spur group disagreed with the core situationist stance of counting on a revolutionary proletariat; the accusation that their activities were based on a \\"systematic misunderstanding of situationist theses\\"; the fact that at least one Spur member, Lothar Fischer, and possibly the rest of the group, were not actually understanding and/or agreeing with the situationist ideas, but were just using the SI to get success in the art market; and the betrayal of a common agreement on the Spur and SI publications. The exclusion was the recognition that the Spur group's \\"principles, methods and goals\\" were significantly in contrast with those of the SI.The Counter-Situationist Campaign in Various Countries , Internationale Situationniste #8, 1963. This split however was not a declaration of hostilities, as in other cases of SI exclusions. A few months after the exclusion, in the context of Judicial prosecution against the group by the German state, Debord expressed his esteem to the Spur group, calling it the only significant artistic group in Germany since WW2, and at the level of the avant-gardes in other countries. The SPUR-artists met first at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich in Munich, Germany. They formed the group in 1957, which lasted until 1965. Censorship, police and juridical persecutions Guy Debord remarked that while between 1920‚Äì1933 \\"Germany incontestably had the highest rank in the elaboration of art and, more generally, the culture of our era\\", from the post-war era to 1960, \\"Germany has been characterized by a total cultural void and by the dullest conformism\\". The Spur journal was a flourishing exception to such void and conformism, as it was, for the first time in decades, an artistic group that manifested a certain freedom of investigation, and as an \\"extremely worrisome symptom\\", this group was almost immediately the object of police and juridical persecutions. Helmet Sturim, Dieter Kunzelmann, Heimrad Prem and H.P. Zimmer each received 5 months in prison. Debord noted that Western Europe and the Scandinavian countries, had another level of intellectual tolerance, that such a trial was, at that moment, unthinkable in Paris or Copenhagen. That clumsy affair had already harmed the reputation of the Federal German Republic. Debord asserted that the pretext by which the Spur group was brought to trial, was \\"to make the Spur group, and all those who wish to pursue the same route, succumb to the ambient conformism.\\" Debord ridiculed that trial to the prosecutions of Baudelaire and Flaubert for pornography and immorality in the 19th century France: Relations with the Situationist International The Spur group collaborated with the Situationist International, a restricted group of international revolutionaries, between 1959 and 1961, when the Spur members joined the SI. After a series of core divergences during 1960‚Äì1, the Spur members were officially excluded from the SI on February 10, 1962. After this, despite the two organizations having a \\"sufficiently large objective opposition between their respective principles, methods and goals,\\" Guy Debord expressed esteem to Spur, considering it the highest expression of German art and culture of post WW2.Letter from Guy Debord To the Spur group, 28 April 1962 However, after the exclusion and split, the two groups remained distinct and separated, and each was only responsible for its own autonomous actions.Letter from Guy Debord to Rodolphe Gasche (member of the Spur group), 18 June 1962 The first contact with the Situationist International happened through Asger Jorn. Jorn, one of the most prominent members of the SI, discovered the SPUR-paintings at a gallery managed by art dealer Otto Van de Loo.Nothing to talk about , (essay/interview on Dieter Kunzelmann) Art-Ist 08, Istanbul, Turkey, Halil Altindere and Sezgin Boynik (editors) Later on, the Spur members come to join and became members of the Situationist International, forming the majority of the members of the German section of the SI.Galimberti, Jacopo : Redefining the Individual in West Germany: Spur's and Geflecht's Authorship (1957‚Äì67), Art History, Taylor & Francis, n¬∞ 1, vol. 98, 2016,. A major point of divergence come up from the Spur group during The Fourth SI Conference in London (December 1960). The discussion of a report by Attila Kot√°nyi, leads to posing the question: \\"To what extent is the SI a political movement?\\" Various responses state that the SI is political, but not in the ordinary sense. The discussion becomes somewhat confused. Debord proposes, in order to clearly bring out the opinion of the Conference, that each person respond in writing to a questionnaire asking if he considers that there are \\"forces in the society that the SI can count on? What forces? In what conditions?\\" This questionnaire is agreed upon and filled out. When, a day later, the Spur members present a joint response to the questionnaire, in which they reject the concept of a proletarian revolution, it generates a sharp debate:The Fourth SI Conference in London , Internationale Situationniste #5 (December 1960) This position was critiqued by Debord, Nash, Kot√°nyi and Jorn. The majority of the S.I. seems to be against it, and the Spur members are asked to formalize their position so it can be brought to a vote. But, when the Spur group return from their deliberation, they retract the preceding declaration. Debord starts to suspect that the Spur members were not actually understanding and/or agreeing with the situationist ideas, and that they were instead using the SI to get success in the art market. As a consequence, during the Fifth SI Conference held in Gothenburg, Sweden, 28‚Äì30 August 1961, Asger Jorn (signing himself as \\"George Keller\\") proposed to unify the S.I. publications in the various countries (including Spur) as a single journal, to be translated in four editions in English, French, German and Swedish. The reaction of the Spur members to this proposal was mentioned in the conference report: Despite Spur agreement to add Attila Kot√°nyi and Jacqueline de Jong to the editorial committee of Spur, the following issue #7 was printed five months later without Kot√°nyi and de Jong's knowledge. The issue #7 featured considerable divergences with the SI ideas, marking a distinct regression from the preceding #5 and #6 issues. These events led the following month, February 1962, to the exclusion from the SI of those responsible. The arguments for the exclusion, declared in a letter on February 10, 1962, were that \\"fractional activity of this group is based on a systematic misunderstanding of situationist theses\\",The Exclusion of the Spurists, Internationale Situationniste #8, 1963.The Fifth SI Conference in G√∂teborg , Internationale Situationniste #7 (April 1962) that they were using the Situationists to succeed on the art market and that do achieve this they had \\"perfectly disregarded the discipline of the S.I.\\". On the accusation of using the SI to \\"arrive\\" as artists, Spur member Dieter Kunzelmann admitted that it applied for sure to Lothar Fischer, but rejected that it was true for the other Spur members present at the Fifth SI Conference in Gothenburg.

History  The use of the Moon as a passive communications satellite was proposed by W.J. Bray of the British General Post Office in 1940. It was calculated that with the available microwave transmission powers and low noise receivers, it would be possible to beam microwave signals up from Earth and reflect them off the Moon. It was thought that at least one voice channel would be possible. In the English literature, which has also become known in German-speaking countries, it was always assumed that the first EME was done in the USA. But according to reports by Dr. Ing. W. Stepp in the \\"Der Seewart\\" magazine, it seems that already in 1943, during experiments with radio measurement equipment, (radar) reflections of the moon were received and recognized as such. Since so far nothing was published about this in cq-DL, the report by Dr. Stepp is presented here as a preamble to the activities of German VHF amateurs. Dr. Stepp writes: \\"In 1943 Telefunken had taken up the task of developing radio measuring equipment for detecting and surveying targets near ground -- ships, low-flying aircraft, cars -- with as large a range as possible. The task of locating near-ground targets especially required, besides high power and high receiver sensitivity, wavelengths as short as possible. A setup with the following parameters was developed, matching the possibilities of that time: Transmitter impulse power 120 kW ; Impulse duration 1.5 ¬µs ; Wavelength 53 cm, about 564 MHz ; RX sensitivity 12 kTo ; Antenna surface 45 m2 ; Polarization horizontal ; Number of dipoles 8 per row horiz., 80 per column vert. [Translator's note: presumably the 12 kTo sensitivity means the receiver's own noise is 12 times thermal noise (Boltzmann's constant k times absolute temperature To), which is equivalent to a noise figure of 11 dB.] The antenna could be rotated around its vertical axis. It was strongly focused vertically with the first nulls 1.3¬∞ away from the horizontal main lobe. The device was given the name \\"W√ºrzmann\\". For testing, the system was set up in late 1943 on the Bakenberg on the south of the island of R√ºgen. The measurement results confirmed the calculated ranges: ships of average size were detected up to the horizon, about 50 km, and airplanes till 1000 m high up to distances of about 100 km. But with favorable weather conditions the system detected targets in the harbour of Gdansk and the Gulf of Finland. After the first tests I assigned Willi Thiel, one of the very competent engineers, to take care of the equipment on his own and continuously perform observations. Some weeks later I again travelled to the R√ºgen island for experiments near G√∂hren. On the last day of the experiments, just a few hours before leaving back to Berlin, I visited the Bakenberg again. The sky was very dull, the night very dark. On the way to the Bakenberg W. Thiel reported about a \\"strange equipment perturbation\\", which he had observed on the previous day at approximately the same time, but of which he had not been able to find the cause; however, it had become less after about two hours despite him not fixing it, and in the end had disappeared completely. After activating the W√ºrzmann, I made the following observation: the \\"perturbation\\" again appeared, had a duration of several impulses, and larger impulse strength than the strongest nearby targets. It didn't appear until about two seconds after switching on the transmitter and disappeared (pulsatingly) correspondingly later after switching it off. But the rest of the echo image appeared and disappeared at the instance of switching the transmitter on/off. The \\"perturbation\\" only occurred when the antenna was aimed to the east, and it disappeared immediately upon a major change of direction, but reappeared only about two seconds after rotating back to the original direction. Apparently we had detected the rising moon behind the clouds with the equipment. I explained the gradual disappearance of the impulses by the reflecting body slowly moving out of the strongly focussed, horizontally aimed beam, as it rises above the horizon. Soon after this, the equipment was put into regular use, and I haven't heard about further observations.\\" DK2ZF http://pa3fwm.nl/technotes/annex/cqdl-7-79-eme.html The \\"Moon bounce\\" technique was developed in parallel by the United States military and the Hungarian group led by Zolt√°n Bay in the years after World War II. The second successful reception of echoes off the Moon was carried out at Fort Monmouth, New Jersey on January 10, 1946 by John H. DeWitt as part of Project Diana. It was followed by Zolt√°n Bay's group on February 6, 1946. The Communication Moon Relay project that followed led to more practical uses, including a teletype link between the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii and United States Navy headquarters in Washington, D.C. In the days before communications satellites, a link free of the vagaries of ionospheric propagation was revolutionary. The development of communication satellites in the 1960s made this technique obsolete. However radio amateurs took up EME communication as a hobby; the first amateur radio moonbounce communication took place in 1953, and amateurs worldwide still use the technique.  Current EME communications  Amateur radio (ham) operators utilize EME for two-way communications. EME presents significant challenges to amateur operators interested in weak signal communication. EME provides the longest communications path any two stations on Earth can use. Amateur frequency bands from 50 MHz to 47 GHz have been used successfully, but most EME communications are on the 2 meter, 70-centimeter, or 23-centimeter bands. Common modulation modes are continuous wave with Morse code, digital (JT65) and when the link budgets allow, voice. Recent advances in digital signal processing have allowed EME contacts, admittedly with low data rate, to take place with powers in the order of 100 Watts and a single Yagi‚ÄìUda antenna. World Moon Bounce Day, June 29, 2009, was created by Echoes of Apollo and celebrated worldwide as an event preceding the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. A highlight of the celebrations was an interview via the Moon with Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders, who was also part of the backup crew for Apollo 11. The University of Tasmania in Australia with their 26-meter dish were able to bounce a data signal off the surface of the Moon which was received by a large dish in the Netherlands, Dwingeloo Radio Observatory. The data signal was successfully resolved back to data setting a world record for the lowest power data signal returned from the Moon with a transmit power of 3 milliwatts, about 1,000th of the power of a flashlight lamp. The second World Moon Bounce Day was April 17, 2010, coinciding with the 40th anniversary of the conclusion of the Apollo 13 mission. In October 2009 media artist Daniela de Paulis proposed to the CAMRAS radio amateur association based at the Dwingeloo Radio Observatory to use Moon bounce for a live image transmission performance. As a result of her proposal, in December 2009 CAMRAS radio operator Jan van Muijlwijk and radio operator Daniel Gautchi made the first image transmission via the Moon using the open source software MMSSTV. De Paulis called the innovative technology \\"Visual Moonbounce\\" and since 2010 she has been using it in several of her art projects, including the live performance called OPTICKS, during which digital images are sent to the Moon and back in real time and projected live.  Echo delay and time spread  Radio waves propagate in vacuum at the speed of light c, exactly 299,792,458 m/s. Propagation time to the Moon and back ranges from 2.4 to 2.7 seconds, with an average of 2.56 seconds (distance from Earth to the Moon is 384,400 km). The Moon is nearly spherical, and its radius corresponds to about 5.8 milliseconds of wave travel time. The trailing parts of an echo, reflected from irregular surface features near the edge of the lunar disk, are delayed from the leading edge by as much as twice this value. Most of the Moon's surface appears relatively smooth at the typical microwave wavelengths used for amateur EME. Most amateurs do EME contacts below 6 GHz, and differences in the moon's reflectivity are somewhat hard to discern above 1 GHz. Lunar reflections are by nature quasi-specular (like those from a shiny ball bearing). The power useful for communication is mostly reflected from a small region near the center of the disk. The effective time spread of an echo amounts to no more than 0.1 ms. Antenna polarization for EME stations must consider that reflection from a smooth surface preserves linear polarization but reverses the sense of circular polarizations. At shorter wavelengths the lunar surface appears increasingly rough, so reflections at 10 GHz and above contain a significant diffuse component as well as a quasi-specular component. The diffuse component is depolarized, and can be viewed as a source of low level system noise. Significant portions of the diffused component arise from regions farther out toward the lunar rim. The median time spread can then be as much as several milliseconds. In all practical cases, however, time spreading is small enough that it does not cause significant smearing of CW keying or intersymbol interference in the slowly keyed modulations commonly used for digital EME. The diffused component may appear as significant noise at higher message data rates. EME time spreading does have one very significant effect. Signal components reflected from different parts of the lunar surface travel different distances and arrive at Earth with random phase relationships. As the relative geometry of the transmitting station, receiving station and reflecting lunar surface changes, signal components may sometimes add and sometimes cancel. The dynamic addition and cancellation will create large amplitude fluctuations. These amplitude variations are referred to as \\"libration fading\\". These amplitude variations will be well correlated over the coherence bandwidth (typically a few kHz). The libration fading components are related to the time spread of reflected signals.  Modulation types and frequencies for EME  VHF * CW * JT65A and JT65B UHF * CW * JT65B * SSB Microwave * CW * SSB * JT4F or G  Other factors influencing EME communications  Doppler effect at 144 MHz band is 300 Hz at moonrise or moonset. The doppler offset goes to around zero when the Moon is overhead. At other frequencies other doppler offsets will exist. At moonrise, returned signals will be shifted approximately 300 Hz higher in frequency. As the Moon traverses the sky to a point due south, the Doppler effect approaches zero. By Moonset, they are shifted 300 Hz lower. Doppler effects cause many problems when tuning into, and locking onto, signals from the Moon. Polarization effects can reduce the strength of received signals. One component is the geometrical alignment of the transmitting and receiving antennas. Many antennas produce a preferred plane of polarization. Transmitting and receiving station antennas may not be aligned from the perspective of an observer on the moon. This component is fixed by the alignment of the antennas and stations may include a facility to rotate antennas to adjust polarization. Another component is Faraday rotation on the Earth-Moon-Earth path. The plane of polarization of radio waves rotates as they pass through ionized layers of the Earth's atmosphere. This effect is more pronounced at lower VHF frequencies and becomes less significant at 1296 MHz and above. Some of the polarization mismatch loss can be reduced by using a larger antenna array (more Yagi elements or a larger dish).Larry Wolfgang, Charles Hutchinson, (ed), The ARRL Handbook for Radio Amateurs, Sixty Eighth Edition , American Radio Relay League, 1990 , pages 23-34, 23-25,  Gallery  Image:EA6VQ_EME.jpgAn array of 8 Yagi antennas for 144 MHz EME at EA6VQ, Balearic Islands, Spain Image:144MHz_EME.jpgA part of 144 MHz EME antenna array at WA6PY in California, USA Image:EME_dish.jpgA dish antenna for microwave EME work at WA6PY, California, USA Image:I2FZX_UHF_EME_Antenna.pngA dish antenna for UHF EME at I2FZX, Milan, Italy File:SM3PWM EME Antenna.jpgAmateur Radio antenna array used for Earth‚ÄìMoon‚ÄìEarth communication on 144 MHz.

It was produced by Sam Harris. The protagonist, Liza Elliott, is the unhappy female editor of a fashion magazine, Allure, who is undergoing psychoanalysis. The musical ran on Broadway in 1941, in the United Kingdom in 1981, and was also made into a 1944 film and a live 1954 television special. Background The musical's theme of psychoanalysis is said to be based on Hart's own experiences with psychoanalyst Gregory Zilboorg.Detailed review of the film moviediva.com, accessed February 4, 2011 Except for the final song, all the music in the play is heard in three extended dream sequences: the Glamour Dream, the Wedding Dream, and the Circus Dream, which, to some extent, become three small operettas integrated into a straight play. The final song, \\"My Ship\\", functions as a leitmotif for Liza's insecurity: as each dream commences, a snippet of the tune is heard, as it is a haunting melody which Liza recognizes but cannot name, or sing with words, until her anxiety is resolved. Productions The musical opened on Broadway at the Alvin Theatre (now the Neil Simon) on January 23, 1941 and closed on May 30, 1942 after 467 performances. Direction was by Hart, produced by Sam H. Harris, with musical staging by Hassard Short, who also was the production designer, and choreography by Albertina Rasch. The original cast included Gertrude Lawrence, Danny Kaye, Bert Lytell, Victor Mature, Donald Randolph, Margaret Dale, Davis Cunningham and Macdonald Carey. Kaye's performance as fashion photographer Russell Paxton, and particularly his consistently showstopping performance of the patter song \\"Tschaikowsky (and Other Russians)\\" in which he dashes through the names of 50 Russian composers in 39 seconds, made him a star.McClung, Bruce. p. 33 The musical went on an eight city tour for 160 performances,McClung, p. 140 and also played on the West Coast, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, for 56 performances. The show then ran at The Broadway Theatre from February 27 through May 15, 1943, for 83 performances. Gertrude Lawrence reprised her role as Liza Elliott in all venues.McClung, pp. 139-140 Subsequent productions Lady in the Dark premiered in the United Kingdom on December 9, 1981, at Nottingham Playhouse, Nottingham; Celeste Holm, in her British debut, starred.McClung, pp. 195‚Äì196 Kendall Nesbitt was Jeremy Hawk, Robert Swales played Randy Curtis and Kenneth Nelson appeared as Russell Paxton.

According to the liner notes, the maximum playing time of an LP did not permit including everything, and some cuts were made (not specified, but mostly in the number of verses or repeats). The Royal National Theatre revival in 1997 led to the first complete recording of the score (TER/JAY).

Late in life, Roch√© published two novels: his first was Jules et Jim (1953), a semi-autobiographical work published when he was 74. His second novel, Les deux anglaises et le continent (Two English Girls, 1956), was also inspired by his life. Both were adapted as films by the director Fran√ßois Truffaut, in 1962 and 1971 respectively. The popularity of the film Jules et Jim brought renewed attention to Roch√©'s novels and life.  Biography  Roch√© was born in Paris, France. In 1898, he was an art student at the Acad√©mie Julian.Lake, Carlton et al. (1991). Henri-Pierre Roch√©: an Introduction, p. 190. Roch√© became a respected journalist as well as an art collector and dealer. At the turn of the 20th century, he became close friends with a number of young European artists from the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris including Manuel Ortiz de Z√°rate and Marie Vassilieff; and from Montmartre, Max Jacob and Pablo Picasso. He was at home in the world of artists, collectors and gallerists. In November 1905, he introduced the Americans Leo Stein and his sister Gertrude Stein to Picasso. Leo described Roch√© as \\"a tall man with an inquiring eye under an inquisitive forehead, wanted to know something more about everything. He was a born liaison officer, who knew everybody and wanted everybody to know everybody else.\\"Stein, Leo. Appreciation. Lincoln: Nebraska Press, 1996, 169-70. Gertrude Stein, in chapter 3 of her The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas, described Roch√© in much the same terms. She particularly appreciated his having read her Three Lives and early recognition of her value as a writer.Stein, Gertrude. The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas. (1957/Penguin, reprint 2001), pp. 50-51 Roch√© was also a friend of Francis Picabia, Constantin Br√¢ncu»ôi and Marcel Duchamp. Following his discharge from the French army, Roch√© and Duchamp traveled to New York City in 1916. There, they teamed up with Beatrice Wood to create The Blind Man, a magazine that was one of the earliest manifestations in the United States of the Dada art movement. Roch√© became the chief advisor to the renowned American collector John Quinn in 1917, and made many notable acquisitions for him between 1917 and 1924. Known for his womanizing, Roch√© also married twice, first to Germaine Bonnard (1927-1948; separated 1933), then to Denise Renard (1948-1959). He had no children with Bonnard. His only child, a son with Renard, Jean-Claude Roche, was born in 1931. Later years and writing In his later years, he wrote and published two successful novels. His first novel, Jules et Jim (1952), was published when he was 74. His second novel, also inspired by his life, was Les deux anglaises et le continent (Two English Girls, 1956). Both novels, although written by a man who was quite advanced in age, express a vitality and freshness not often seen in French romantic stories of the time. After Jules et Jim was adapted by Fran√ßois Truffaut as the 1962 film Jules et Jim, both of Roch√©'s novels attracted widespread interest and sales. Since the late 20th century, biographies of Beatrice Wood have associated Roch√©'s first novel with the love triangle among Duchamp, Wood and Roch√©. \\\\- Other sources say he referred to this triangle in his unfinished novel, Victor. Beatrice Wood commented on this topic on p. 136 of her 1985 autobiography, I Shock Myself: Jules et Jim has been documented as inspired by the triangle among Roch√©, the German writer Franz Hessel (who translated Marcel Proust into German, as the character Jules did) and Helen Grund, who married Hessel. \\\\- Thierry Lecl√®re, \\"St√©phane Hessel, un homme engag√© : ‚ÄúJ‚Äôai toujours √©t√© du c√¥t√© des dissidents‚Äù\\", T√©l√©rama, 5 June 2008, updated 12 March 2011).

Retrieved 17 March 2011 The French director Fran√ßois Truffaut came across Jules et Jim at a secondhand bookseller. He looked up Roch√© and befriended him when the writer was in his final years. Roch√© died in 1959 in S√®vres, Hauts- de-Seine. The earliest translation of Jules et Jim into English was for a Panther paperback published in Great Britain in 1963. Representation in other media Truffaut was so impressed by Roch√©'s two novels that he adapted each of them for films with the same titles. Truffaut's adaptation of Jules et Jim (1962) was very popular, bringing renewed attention to Roche's novels. In 1971, Truffaut directed and released Les deux anglaises et le continent, starring Jean-Pierre L√©aud.  Notes  References * Lake, Carlton and Linda Ashton. (1991).

An ardent supporter of prohibition of alcoholic beverages, he helped reunify the state's Democratic Party, which had been divided over the issue for nearly a decade. Rye is perhaps best remembered for enacting the \\"Ouster Law,\\" which was aimed at curbing the power of political boss E. H. Crump.Anne-Leslie Owens, \\"Thomas Clarke Rye,\\" Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture, 2009. Retrieved: 4 December 2012. Early life Rye was born in Benton County, Tennessee, the son of Wayne Rye, a merchant, and Elizabeth (Atchison) Rye. He was educated at local schools, and read law under his uncle, Colonel Tom Morris, in nearby Charlotte, Tennessee. In 1884, after his admission to the bar, he moved to Camden, Tennessee, to practice law. During the 1890s, he served as circuit master of Camden's chancery court, and worked for several years as a pension agent in Washington, D. C. In 1902, Rye moved to Paris, Tennessee, where he established a law partnership with W.W. Farquard. Rye served as District Attorney for the Thirteenth Judicial District from 1910 to 1914. He quickly gained a reputation as the state's most \\"stringent\\" law enforcement agent, and was described as a \\"terror to the bootleggers and dispensers of whisky.\\" Governor In the early 1910s, the state Democratic Party was divided over the issue of prohibition. One faction, known as the \\"Independent Democrats,\\" wanted the state's Four Mile Law (which banned the sale of liquor within four miles of any school) to apply statewide, while the other faction, known as the \\"Regular Democrats,\\" wanted the state's larger cities to be exempt from the law. In 1910, the Independent Democrats fled the party and formed a coalition, known as the \\"Fusionists,\\" with Republicans, helping to elect Governor Ben W. Hooper.Phillip Langsdon, Tennessee: A Political History (Franklin, Tenn.: Hillsboro Press, 2000), pp. 287-295. At its May convention in 1914, the Democratic Party added statewide prohibition to the party's platform, all but ending the rift between Regular and Independent Democratics. Rye, well known among supporters of prohibition, received the endorsements of Senator Luke Lea and former Governor Malcolm R. Patterson, and was nominated as the party's candidate. With the party once again unified, Rye defeated Hooper 137,656 votes to 116,667. Hooper accused Memphis political boss E.H. Crump of fixing the vote in Shelby County, but no investigation was launched. Governor Rye (seated, second from the left) and his staff During his first term, Rye enacted the so-called \\"Ouster Law,\\" which allowed for the removal of public officials for incompetence or unwillingness to enforce the law. This law was aimed primarily at Crump, who as Mayor of Memphis had refused to enforce prohibition in the city. The state attorney general filed a suit removing Crump in October 1915. When the Tennessee Supreme Court upheld the action, the Rye administration proceeded to purge any official who refused to enforce prohibition, among them District Attorney Newton Estes and Judge Jesse Edgington of Memphis, as well as several officials in Nashville (including Mayor Hilary Howse) and Knoxville.Stanley Folmsbee, Robert Corlew, and Enoch Mitchell, Tennessee: A Short History (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1969), pp. 449, 461. Rye's administration created the State Highway Department (the modern Tennessee Department of Transportation) in 1915. He signed legislation requiring automobile registration, and implemented a state highway tax to match federal funding. In April 1915, Rye attended a meeting of the Dixie Highway Association, where he helped set the route of the Dixie Highway, an early tourist road connecting the Midwestern states with Florida.Leslie Sharp, Tennessee's Dixie Highway (Arcadia Publishing, 2011), p. 19. In March 1915, Rye signed legislation chartering Tennessee Polytechnic Institute (modern Tennessee Technological University) in Cookeville. During his tenure, he expanded the state's Board of Education, and implemented a tax to support schools. In the governor's race of 1916, Republicans nominated John W. Overall, a U.S. marshal from Liberty, Tennessee. Rye defeated Overall by a vote of 146,758 to 117,817. During Rye's second term, the United States entered World War I. Over 80,000 Tennesseans entered the United States Armed Forces, and more of them were deployed overseas than ever before in Tennessee history. The number of Tennesseans was the most ever serving actively in the military up to that time except for the number serving in Confederate forces during the Civil War. In 1917, Rye enacted legislation that implemented a primary for selecting candidates for state offices from the Democratic and Republican parties (candidates were previously selected by delegates at party conventions). The debate over primaries had divided the Democratic Party since the 1910 elections. Later life At the end of his second term, Rye did not seek reelection. He instead ran for the U.S. Senate seat held by John K. Shields. Shields, who had been elected to the seat by the state legislature prior to the passage of the 17th Amendment (which established direct election of senators), had angered President Woodrow Wilson by opposing the League of Nations, and Wilson threatened to endorse Rye. Senator Kenneth McKellar convinced the president to withhold his endorsement in return for Shields' support for the League, however, and Shields defeated Rye for the nomination. After losing the Senate nomination, Rye returned to Paris to practice law. In 1922, he was appointed chancellor (judge) of the state's Eighth Judicial District. He remained in this position for nearly two decades.William T. Hale, A History of Tennessee and Tennesseans (Lewis Publishing Company, 1913; rev. 1938). Transcribed by Christine Walters, GenealogyTrails.com. Retrieved: 4 December 2012. Rye died in Paris on September 12, 1953, and was buried in the city's Maplewood Cemetery. At the time of his death, he became the second longest-lived governor in Tennessee history at the age of 90 years and 3 months. Governor John I. Cox was the longest at 90 years, 9 months. In April 2018, Winfield Dunn (b. July 1927) broke Cox's longevity record and as of July 2019, has surpassed his 92nd birthday, and now Rye is the third longest-lived governor in state history. Family Rye was descended from Irish immigrants. He married Bettie Arnold in 1887. They had a daughter, Nell, and a son, Paul.

The antenna radiates radio waves in a beam toward the right. In a radio antenna, a passive radiator or parasitic element is a conductive element, typically a metal rod, which is not electrically connected to anything else. Multielement antennas such as the Yagi-Uda antenna typically consist of a \\"driven element\\" which is connected to the radio receiver or transmitter through a feed line, and parasitic elements, which are not. The purpose of the parasitic elements is to modify the radiation pattern of the radio waves emitted by the driven element, directing them in a beam in one direction, increasing the antenna's directivity (gain). A parasitic element does this by acting as a passive resonator, something like a guitar's sound box, absorbing the radio waves from the nearby driven element and re-radiating them again with a different phase. The waves from the different antenna elements interfere, strengthening the antenna's radiation in the desired direction, and cancelling out the waves in undesired directions. Description The parasitic elements in a Yagi antenna are mounted parallel to the driven element, with all the elements usually in a line perpendicular to the direction of radiation of the antenna. What effect a parasitic element has on the radiation pattern depends both on its separation from the next element, and on its length. The driven element of the antenna is usually a half-wave dipole, its length half a wavelength of the radio waves used. The parasitic elements are of two types. A \\"reflector\\" is slightly longer (around 5%) than a half-wavelength. It serves to reflect the radio waves in the opposite direction. A \\"director\\" is slightly shorter than a half- wavelength; it serves to increase the radiation in a given direction. A Yagi antenna may have a reflector on one side of the driven element, and one or more directors on the other side. If all the elements are in a plane, usually only one reflector is used, because additional ones give little improvement in gain, but sometimes additional reflectors are mounted above and below the plane of the antenna on a vertical bracket at the end. A Yagi antenna for UHF TV reception with 22 parasitic elements; 4 reflectors attached to the vertical bracket at left, and 18 directors attached to the horizontal beam at right. The driven element is attached to the black box next to the reflectors. The antenna is most sensitive to radio waves coming from the right, parallel to the antenna's axis. All the elements are usually mounted on a metal beam or bracket along the antenna's central axis. Although sometimes the parasitic elements are insulated from the supporting beam, often they are clamped or welded directly to it, electrically connected to it. This doesn't affect their functioning, because the RF voltage distribution along the element is maximum at the ends and goes to zero (has a node) at the midpoint where the grounded beam is attached. The addition of parasitic elements gives a diminishing improvement in the antenna's gain. Adding a reflector to a dipole, to make a 2-element Yagi, increases the gain by about 5 dB over the dipole. Adding a director to this, to give a 3-element Yagi, gives a gain of about 7 dB over a dipole. As a rule of thumb, each additional parasitic element beyond this adds about 1 dB of gain. In an example of a parasitic element that is not rod- shaped, a parasitic microstrip patch antenna is sometimes mounted above another driven patch antenna. This antenna combination resonates at a slightly lower frequency than the original element. However, the main effect is to greatly increase the impedance bandwidth of the antenna. In some cases the bandwidth can be increased by a factor of 10. Comparison of a Yagi with parasitic elements to a log periodic, with all active elements Not all types of thin conductor multielement antennas have parasitic elements. The log periodic antenna is similar in appearance to a Yagi, but all of its elements are driven elements, connected to the transmitter or receiver.

Typical LPX riser card, with connectors for PCI and ISA cards LPX (short for Low Profile eXtension), originally developed by Western Digital, was a loosely defined motherboard format (form factor) widely used in the 1990s. There was never any official LPX specification, but the design normally featured a motherboard with the main I/O ports mounted on the back (something that was later adopted by the ATX form factor), and a riser card in the center of the motherboard, on which the PCI and ISA slots were mounted. Due to the lack of standardized specification, riser cards were seldom compatible from one motherboard design to another, much less one manufacturer to another. The internal PSU connector was of the same type used in the AT form factor. One of the more successful features to come out of the LPX specification was its use of more compact power supplies, which later became widely used on Baby AT and even full size AT cases. Because LPX form factor power supplies became ubiquitous in most computer cases prior to the ATX standard, it was not unusual for manufacturers to refer to them as \\"AT\\" power supplies (or occasionally as \\"PS/2\\" power supplies due to its use by the IBM PS/2), even though the actual AT and Baby AT power supply form factors were larger in size. The LPX form factor power supply eventually formed the basis for the ATX form factor power supply, which is the same width and height. The specification was very popular in the early-mid 1990s, and briefly displaced the AT form factor as the most commonly used. However, the release of the Pentium II in 1997 highlighted the flaws of the format, as a good airflow was important in Pentium II systems, owing to the relatively high heat dispersal requirements of the processor. LPX systems suffered a restricted airflow due to the centrally placed riser cards. The introduction of the AGP format further complicated matters, as the design not only increased the pin count on riser cards, but it limited most cards to one AGP, one PCI and one ISA slot, which was too restrictive for most users. Some lower-quality LPX boards didn't even feature a real AGP slot, but simply used a physical AGP slot and connected it to the PCI bus. This was seldom noticed however, as many \\"AGP\\" graphics cards of the time were in fact PCI cards internally, and did not take advantage of the features offered by AGP. LPX was phased out around 1998. NLX was the intended successor, though many manufacturers chose MicroATX or proprietary motherboard formats instead.

History  Henri Negresco, born Alexandru Negrescu was the son of an innkeeper. He was educated and worked as a confectioner at the luxurious Casa Cap»ôa in Bucharest, Romania, left home at the age of 25 (earlier sources mentioned 15, but it is not really possible, he finished the military service in Romania and there is at least one photo with him in Bucharest at older age) going first to Paris then to the French Riviera where he became very successful. As director of the Municipal Casino in Nice, he had the idea to build a sumptuous hotel of quality that would attract the wealthiest of clients. After arranging the financing, he hired the great architect of the \\"caf√© society\\" √âdouard-Jean Niermans to design the hotel and its now famous pink dome. The Royal Lounge with its chandelier and stained glass window The spectacular Baccarat 16,309-crystal chandelier in the Negresco's Royal Lounge was commissioned by Czar Nicholas II, who due to the October revolution was unable to take delivery. Contrary to popular belief, the large window of the Royal Lounge ‚Äì listed as an Historical Monument ‚Äì is not the work of Gustave Eiffel. Eiffel never worked at the Negresco; instead it is entirely the work of Edouard-Jean Niermans. Henri Negresco faced a downturn in his affairs when World War I broke out two years after he opened for business. His hotel was converted to a hospital. By the end of the war, the number of wealthy visitors to the Riviera had dropped off to the point that the hotel was in severe financial difficulty. Seized by creditors, the Negresco was sold to a Belgian company. Henri Negresco died a few years later in Paris at the age of 52. February 28, 1948, Suzy Delair sang C'est si bon in this hotel during the first Nice Jazz Festival. Louis Armstrong was present and loved the song. June 26, 1950, he recorded the American version of the song (English lyrics by Jerry Seelen) in New York City with Sy Oliver and his Orchestra. When it was released, the disc was a worldwide success and the song was then performed by the greatest international singers. Le Negresco seen at sunrise Main hall Over the years, the hotel had its ups and downs, and in 1957, it was sold to the Augier family. Madame reinvigorated the hotel with luxurious decorations and furnishings, including an outstanding art collection and rooms with mink bedspreads. She also popularised it with celebrities; Elton John featured it in the video for his song \\"I'm Still Standing\\", and she told Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, that purchasing it would be beyond his means.\\"Jeanne Augier: Flamboyant owner of Negresco hotel dies\\", BBC News, 9 January 2019. Noted for its doormen dressed in the manner of the staff in 18th-century elite bourgeois households, complete with red-plumed postilion hats, the hotel also offers gourmet dining at the Regency-style Le Chantecler restaurant. Le Chantecler has two stars in the Guide Michelin and 15/20 in Gault Millau. It has previously been under the leadership of famous chefs such as Bruno Turbot and Alain Llorca, who left to take over the equally fabled Moulin de Mougins. The restaurant interior is decorated with gobelins and roccoco furniture in untraditional colourings such as pink, lime, lemon, and cerulean. In 2003, the Hotel Negresco was listed by the government of France as a National Historic BuildingThe French Riviera Adventure Guide - Ferne Arfin. p. 85. and is a member of Leading Hotels of the World.

His 2003 novel The Known World received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the International Dublin Literary Award. Biography Edward Paul Jones was born and raised in Washington, D.C., and educated at both the College of the Holy Cross and the University of Virginia. His first book, Lost in the City, is a collection of short stories about the African-American working class in 20th-century Washington, D.C. In the early stories are some who are like first-generation immigrants, as they have come to the city as part of the Great Migration from the rural South. His second book, The Known World, was set in a fictional Virginia county and had a protagonist who was a mixed-race black planter and slaveholder. It won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the 2005 International Dublin Literary Award. Jones's third book, All Aunt Hagar's Children, was published in 2006. Like Lost in the City, it is a collection of short stories that deal with African Americans, mostly in Washington, D.C. Several of the stories had been previously published in The New Yorker magazine. The stories in the book take up the lives of ancillary characters in Lost in the City. In 2007, it was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award, which was won by Philip Roth's Everyman. The stories of Jones' first and third book are connected. As Wyatt Mason wrote in Harper's Magazine in 2006: > The fourteen stories of All Aunt Hagar's Children revisit not merely the > city of Washington but the fourteen stories of Lost in the City.

Neely Tucker wrote in 2009: In the spring and fall semesters of 2009, Jones was a visiting professor of creative writing at the George Washington University. In fall 2010 he joined the English department faculty to teach creative writing. Early Life Edward Paul Jones was born on October 5, 1950, in Arlington, Virginia. He is the oldest of 3 children, with 1 sister and 1 brother. His mother was a hotel maid and kitchen worker; Jones grew up in a single parent with his mother for his father had drifted out of his life when he was a preschooler. After attending Catholic school for kindergarten and part of first grade, Jones was educated in Washington public schools. His interest in literature was sparked early. Though comic books formed the mainstay of his reading until he was thirteen years old, he eventually discovered novels. He says in an interview, ‚ÄúI always loved reading. It started with comic books, but then I decided to move further down the bookshelf‚Ä¶ afterwhile i was reading everything I could get my hands on‚Äù. Though there is not much about Edward P. Jones‚Äô early life in his short story ‚ÄúThe First Day‚Äù, readers are able to get a glimpse of it through his creative storytelling. The story is about a young girl who is beginning kindergarten, and her mother who cannot read or write, but is steadfast in getting her daughter registered for school. It can be inferred that this story is reflective of the beginning of his young academic life because as we know his own mother was unable to read or write. This is a story of perseverance and sheer determination, and these same characteristics can be seen in Jones‚Äôs real life when taking into consideration all of his grand accomplishments. Personal Life/ Later Life *Edward P. Jones grew up in the DMV area where he was the son of a maid & a kitchen worker. He grew up rather poor, the oldest of 3 children, 1 sister and 1 mentally challenged brother. With his father being absent from his life, his mother Jenatte struggled keeping her family together. Jones stated that they moved \\"18 times in 18 years\\". Jones attended Catholic school for kindergarten & part of first grade but later continued his matriculation in Washington Public Schools. His mother could not read or right so Jones was forced to sign his own report cards. His love for reading came at an early age, \\"I always loved reading\\" Jones said in an interview. He first began reading comics and things that were funny but it was not until he was mature in his adolescence when he discovered novels. \\"When I started reading black writers, I discovered two books that had a great impact on me: Ethel Waters' His Eye Is On The Sparrow & Richard Wright's Native Son\\" Jones told Publishers Weekly. *On his journey to find a University to attend Jones met a man by the name of Joseph Owens who persuaded him to apply to two colleges, College of the Holy Cross and Boston College. Jones was only accepted into one college and that acceptance was a complete shock to him. Jones recalled receiving a 482 on the reading portion of the SAT and a 532 on the math portion. Jones originally had plans on majoring in Mathematics but during his first year of college he was the only African American student, so he sat at the back of the class and did not ask questions causing him to fall behind in his coursework. Jones quickly switched his major to English. In his graduating class there were only two dozen African American students. *During is final year in college, Jones's mothers health was failing and she had suffered several strokes. On the day of his graduation he only expected his aunt and his sister to be present but Jones recalls looking in the stands and seeing his mother, this was one of their final memorable moments together. After completing his matriculation Jones returned to Washington to help care for his mother, he worked odd jobs causing him to live paycheck to paycheck. After his mothers passing Jones decided that he no longer wanted to live in Washington. However, his bad news was not all bad when Essence magazine reached out to him informing him that they would publish one of his stories. *After receiving a Masters of Fine Arts degree in 1983 from the University of Virginia, he returned to Washington where he landed a job at a newsletter company. Jones wrote whenever he had the time, his first piece of literature \\"Lost in the City\\" was a collection of short stories about his life in Washington D.C. he received numerous awards and accolades for this book. Immediately after the books success, Jones started working on his second book a novel about slaves who owned slaves. Jones stated that he did not remember where he saw that information but it stuck with him. In the midst of writing his second book \\"The Known World\\" Jones was laid off from his job. The Known World became a New York Times Bestseller & also received numerous accolades and awards. *To date (October 2020), Jones is never married or had any children. He has published 7 books. Themes In His Writing Edward P. Jones draws some inspiration for his novel Lost in the City from James Joyce‚Äôs Dubliners. James Joyce was an Irish novelist who contributed greatly to the avant-garde movement, and is one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. The avant garde movement consisted of people and/or works that were seen as radical and unorthodox with respect to art, culture, and society - characterized by aesthetic innovation. Though it is The Known World that Jones is awarded the Pulitzer prize for, readers are able to see in both works the reflection of Joyce‚Äôs influence. In an interview Jones talks about slavery being an epicenter in the lives of Black people, his included, and this emerges from a subconscious he has from simply living everyday. The Known World is a literal slave narrative, but the character(s) in ‚ÄúLost in the City‚Äù, the actual short story and the novel, are metaphorical slave(s); to something. In this Jones presents us with an overarching theme of naturalism. Naturalism, in regards to his particular writing style, is more realistic and an authentic presentation of the world through the lens of the writer. It is deterministic, and instead the environment itself is oppressive. This book of short stories ranges from the youngest of Washingtonians to the oldest. The theme of naturalism coupled with realism, taking a truth at face value, breeds a work that presents the natives of this city in a light that is true for Jones and other natives. To give an example of realism in another short story, the story of ‚ÄúMarie‚Äù is one that also has a theme of urban renewal embedded in it. In this story it is about an older lady that tells her experience with the Social Security Office. In a section of the story, she is walking to the store not far from her apartment that she has lived in for many years, she is mugged by a young man who she describes as ‚Äú20, no older than 25‚Ä¶ dressed like the rest of them, like a blind person matched their colors‚Äù (Edward P. Jones, Lost in the City, ‚ÄúMarie‚Äù). When thinking about the word ‚Äúurban renewal‚Äù the word gentrification could be thought of as a synonym to it. Going back to the chronology of the stories, youngest to oldest, this new age of younger people in a neighborhood that she has lived in her entire life is considered as a form of urban renewal.

The definition of \\"grave breach\\" in some of the Geneva Conventions have text that extend additional protections, but all the Conventions share the following text in common: \\"... committed against persons or property protected by the Convention: willful killing, torture or inhuman treatment, including biological experiments, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health.\\" The law applies if either the victim or the perpetrator is a national of the United States or a member of the U.S. Armed Forces. The penalty may be life imprisonment or death. The death penalty is only invoked if the conduct resulted in the death of one or more victims. The act was passed with overwhelming majorities by the United States Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Legislative history The law criminalized breaches of the Geneva Conventions so that the United States could prosecute war criminals, specifically North Vietnamese soldiers who tortured U.S. military personnel during the Vietnam War. The Department of Defense \\"fully support[ed] the purposes of the bill,\\" recommending that it be expanded to include a longer list of war crimes. Because the United States generally followed the Conventions, the military recommended making breaches by U.S. military personnel war crimes as well \\"because doing so set a high standard for others to follow.\\" The bill passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and by a voice vote in the House, showing that it was entirely uncontroversial at the time. Ten years later, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applied to the War on Terrorism, with the unstated implication that any interrogation technique that violated Common Article 3 constituted war crimes. The possibility that American officials and military personnel could be prosecuted for war crimes for committing the \\"outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment\\" prohibited by the Conventions led to a series of proposals to make such actions legal in certain circumstances, which resulted in the Military Commissions Act of 2006. Potential application White House officials were concerned that they and other U.S. officials could be prosecuted under the War Crimes Act for the U.S. treatment of detainees after the September 11 attacks for violations of the Geneva Conventions. In a January 2002 memorandum to the president, then-White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales authored a controversial memo that explored whether Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applied to Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants captured during the war in Afghanistan and held in detention facilities around the world, including Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The memo made several arguments both for and against providing Common Article 3's protections to Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants. He concluded that Common Article 3 was outdated and ill-suited for dealing with captured Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants. He described as \\"quaint\\" the provisions that require providing captured Al Qaeda and Taliban combatants \\"commissary privileges, scrip, athletic uniforms, and scientific instruments\\". He also argued that existing military regulations and instructions from the President were more than adequate to ensure that the principles of the Geneva Conventions would be applied. He also argued that undefined language in the Geneva Conventions, such as \\"outrages upon personal dignity\\" and \\"inhuman treatment\\", could make officials and military leaders subject to the War Crimes Act of 1996 if mistreatment was discovered.Gonzales, Alberto. Decision Re Application of the Geneva Convention on Prisoners of War to the Conflict with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, Memorandum for the President, January 25, 2002. (PDF file provided by MSNBC/Newsweek) The adoption of the Military Commissions Act of 2006 marked grave abuses of Common Article 3 to only include torture, cruel or inhumane treatment, murder, mutilation or maiming, intentionally causing serious bodily harm, rape, sexual assault or abuse, and the taking of hostages, thereby limiting the scope of the original law.

The company was founded by the Marquis Jules- Albert de Dion, Georges Bouton, and Bouton's brother-in-law Charles Tr√©pardoux. The company was formed after de Dion in 1881 saw a toy locomotive in a store window and asked the toymakers to build another. Engineers Bouton and Tr√©pardoux had been eking out a living with scientific toys at a shop in the Passage de L√©on, near \\"rue de la Chapelle\\" in Paris.Wise, p. 510. Tr√©pardoux had long dreamed of building a steam car, but neither could afford it. De Dion, already inspired by steam (in the form of rail locomotives)Georgano, p. 27. and with ample money,Georgano, p. 24 cap. agreed, and De Dion, Bouton et Tr√©pardoux was formed in Paris in 1883. This became the De Dion-Bouton automobile company, the world's largest automobile manufacturer for a time, becoming well known for their quality, reliability and durability.Wise, pp. 511‚Äì4 passim. Steam cars Paris‚ÄìRouen race of 1894 Before 1883 was over, they had set up shop in larger premises in the Passage de L√©on, Paris,Wise, p. 511. tried and dropped steam engines for boats, and produced a steam car. With the boiler and engine mounted at the front, driving the front wheels by belts and steering with the rear, it burned to the ground on trials. They built a second, La Marquise, the next year, with a more conventional steering and rear-wheel drive, capable of seating four. The Marquis de Dion entered one of these in an 1887 trial, \\"Europe's first motoring competition\\", the brainchild of one M. Fossier of cycling magazine Le V√©locip√®de. Evidently, the promotion was insufficient, for the De Dion was the sole entrant, but it completed the course, with de Dion at the tiller, and was clocked at . This must be taken with considerable care; the first official land speed record, set in 1898, was . The vehicle survives, in road-worthy condition, and has been a regular entry in the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. Following this singular success, the company offered steam tricycles with boilers between the front wheels and two-cylinder engines. They were built in small numbers, evidently a favorite of young playboys. They were later joined by a larger tractor, able to pull trailers (sometimes called a \\"steam drag\\"). This larger vehicle introduced the so-called De Dion or \\"dead\\" axle; an axle beam carried the weight of the vehicle with the non weight-bearing driveshafts or drive chains articulated separately alongside it.(footnote: The live axle carries the weight by a rigid tube around the driveshaft, both parts fastened together.) On July 22, 1894, Paris‚ÄìRouen race, it averaged over the 126 km (78 mi) route, but was disqualified for needing both a driver and a stoker. Two more cars were made in 1885 followed by a series of lightweight two-cylinder tricars, which from 1892 had Michelin pneumatic tyres. In 1893, steam tractors were introduced which were designed to tow horse type carriages for passengers or freight (sometimes called \\"steam drags\\") and these used an innovative axle design which would become known as the De Dion tube, where the location and drive function of the axle are separated. The company manufactured steam buses and trucks until 1904. Trepardoux, staunchly supporting steam, resigned in 1894 as the company turned to internal combustion vehicles. The steam car remained in production more or less unchanged for ten years more. Internal combustion engines =Tricycles= De Dion-Bouton tricycle towing a passenger in a carriage By 1889, de Dion was becoming convinced the future lay in the internal combustion engine, and the company had built a ten-cylinder two-row rotary. After Tr√©pardoux resigned in 1894, the company became De Dion, Bouton et Compagnie. For 1895, Bouton created a new 137 cc (8.4 in3) one- cylinder engine with trembler coilWise, p. 512. ignition. Proving troublesome at its designed speed of 900 rpm (throwing bearings and running rough), when Bouton increased the revs, the problems vanished. In trials, it achieved an unprecedented 3500 rpm, and was usually run at 2,000 rpm, a limit imposed by its atmospheric valves and surface carburettor. Inlet and exhaust valves were overhead, and a flywheel was fitted to each end of the crankshaft. This engine was fitted behind the rear axle of a tricycle frame bought from Decauville, fitted with the new Michelin pneumatic tires. It showed superb performance, and went on the market in 1896 with the engine enlarged to 1¬º CV (Horsepower) (932 W) , with 1¬æ CV (1.3 kW) in 1897. By the time production of the petite voiture tricar stopped in 1901, it had 2¬æ CV (2 kW), while racers had as much as 8 CV (6 kW). In 1898, Louis Renault had a De Dion-Bouton modified with fixed drive shaft and ring and pinion gear, making \\"perhaps the first hot rod in history\\".Yates, Brock. \\"10 Best Moguls\\", in Car and Driver, 1/88, p.47. =Four wheelers= 1903 De Dion & Bouton 8 CV in the Museo Nazionale dell'Automobile, Turin The same year, the tricar was joined by a four-wheeler and in 1900 by a vis a vis voiturette, the Model D, with its 3¬æ CV (2.8 kW) single-cylinder engine under the seat and drive to the rear wheels through a two-speed gearbox. This curious design had the passenger facing the driver, who sat in the rear seat. The voiturette had one inestimable advantage: the expanding clutches of the gearbox were operated by a lever on the steering column. The Model D was developed through Models E, G, I, and J, with 6 CV (4.5 kW) by 1902, when the 8 CV (6 kW) Model K rear-entry phaeton appeared, with front-end styling resembling the contemporary Renault. Until World War I, De Dion-Boutons had an unusual decelerator pedal which reduced engine speed and ultimately applied a transmission brake. In 1902, the Model O introduced three speeds, which was standard for all De Dion-Boutons in 1904.Wise, p. 513. A small number of electric cars were also made in 1901. =Engine supplier to automobile manufacturers= De Dion-Bouton supplied engines to vehicle manufacturers such as Soci√©t√© Parisienne who mounted a 2.5 hp unit directly on the front axle of their front wheel drive voiturette the 'Viktoria Combination'. Engine supplier to moto bicycle builders The De Dion-Bouton engine is considered to the first high-speed lightweight internal combustion engine. It was licensed to more than 150 manufacturers and was a popular choice among assemblers of moto bicycles.Owls Head , 1902 De Dion-Bouton Engine. The small lightweight four cycle engine used a battery and coil ignition that was less trouble than the hot tube ignition. The bore of and stroke of gave this engine an output of . It was used on many pioneering moto bicycle brands and was widely copied by many makers including US Brands Indian and Harley-Davidson. Hildebrand and Wolfmueller, Control and Dynamic Analysis of two wheeled road vehicles. American De Dion 1901 De Dion-Bouton made in the United StatesIn 1901, the De Dion-Bouton Motorette Company began manufacturing De Dion-Bouton automobiles under license in Brooklyn, New York. A small quantity of American De Dion Motorettes were made. These had either 2-seater vis-a-vis or closed coachwork and were powered by 3.5 hp American- made engines. The venture was in operation for only one year. They gained a reputation for unreliability during that time. Representatives of De Dion in the United States claimed that the licensee violated their contract and advertised for a new licensee. Expansion A De Dion-Bouton in 1905 In 1900, De Dion-Bouton was the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing 400 cars and 3,200 engines. The company soon began producing engines and licenses for other automobile companies with an estimate of 150 makes using them. Production was so great, it proved impossible to test every engine; if it failed on the bench, it was simply disassembled. Every engine was being made by hand; the assembly line had not yet been introduced. By 1904 some 40,000 engines had been supplied across Europe. That year, De Dion-Bouton's factory at Quai National (now Quai de Dion-Bouton), Puteaux, employed 1,300 and produced more than 2,000 cars, all hand-made. The engine moved to the front in 1903 in the Populaire with engines, the latter being powerful enough to allow trucks to be added to cars, and by the end of the year reverse gear had also appeared. It was joined by the 6 CV (4 kW) 864 cc (52.5 in3) Types N and Q (the latter a low-priced K), the 8 CV (6 kW) R, and their first multi- cylinder model, the two-cylinder 1728 cc (105 in3) 12 CV (8 kW) S, followed in 1904 by the four-cylinder 15 CV (11 kW) Type AD and 24 CV (18 kW) AI. The cars were also getting more and more conventional in styling, with the radiator moving in front of the engine and the clutch changing from hand lever to pedal. A pair of works 10 CV (7.5 kW) De Dion-Boutons, in the hands of Cormier and Collignon, ran in the 1907 Peking to Paris rally, without success. Bouvier St. Chaffray did no better in the New York to Paris in 1908. That year, De Dion-Bouton peaked as a manufacturer.Wise, p. 514. The company became the first to make a successful mass-produced V8 engine, a 35 CV (26 kW) CJ in 1910, followed by a 7.8 liter and a 14.7 liter for the U.S., as well as by a Type CN in 1912. (They trailed Ader in racing the 1906 Adams, which used an Antoinette aircraft engine.) This would be the company's last innovation.Wise, p. 513 cap. During World War I the company made gun parts, armoured vehicles, and aircraft engines, as well as cars and trucks. The company produced an anti-aircraft version of the French 75mm field gun, the Canon de 75 mod√®le 1897, mounted on a V8-powered De Dion-Bouton truck for the French Army between 1913 and 1918. In Dublin during the Easter Rising of 1916, which opened the Irish War of Independence, The O'Rahilly drove his De Dion Bouton up to the Irish HQ in O'Connell Street, and, discovering that the Rising he had planned and trained soldiers for and then tried to prevent, was actually going on, he drove it into a barricade, walked into the GPO and said: \\"I've helped to wind the clock, I've come to hear it strike.\\" He was killed in a charge against a machine gun nest in Moore Street days later. A famous photograph shows the skeleton of the car in its barricade.  Postwar stagnation  The company stagnated after World War I. The V8 continued to appear until 1923, and in spite of new models with front-wheel brakes, the factory closed for much of 1927. On reopening two models were listed, the Type LA with a four-cylinder overhead valve, aluminium-piston engine, and the Type LB with a straight-8. The latter was very expensive and sales were few, despite growth to in 1930. A rumored takeover by Peugeot or Mercedes did not materialize, leading to the end of passenger car production in 1932. After World War II Small numbers of commercial vehicles were made until 1950; the last vehicles to carry the De Dion badge were licence-made Land Rovers in the early 1950s. The company name was bought by a motorcycle maker in 1955. Railcars De Dion-Bouton JM4 railcar De Dion-Bouton OC1 and OC2 railcars (foreground) De Dion-Bouton built railcars and railcar trailers used on many of the metre gauge railways in France and abroad. The first railcars were produced in the early 1920s, with the Chemin de Fer des C√¥tes-du-Nord receiving its first railcars in 1923.

It is known by various names in Britain, including \\"Mickey Mouse\\", \\"Tactics\\" \\"Horse and Carriage\\", \\"Coach and Horses\\", \\"The Game\\", \\"Faldo\\", \\"Beds and Bulls\\", \\"Oscar Boscar\\" and \\"Pointy Throwies\\". Gameplay Cricket is typically played between 2, 3 or 4 players, or teams of players, although the rules do not discount more players. The goal of cricket is to be the first player to open or close all the cricket numbers and have a higher or even point total. =Cricket numbers= Cricket uses the numbers 15 to 20 (or sometimes 10 to 20, and less frequently a predetermined selection of numbers) and the bull's-eye. To open or close a number, it must have been scored three times in any fashion, on one or more turns. Hitting the triple can open or close a number in one throw; a single and the double can open or close it in two throws or three singles can open or close it in three throws. Except in strict variants which count down from 20 to 15, numbers do not have to be opened or closed in any particular order and several numbers can be hit in the same turn. A scoreboard is used to keep track of the hits on all the numbers. Hitting a number once is shown by placing a slash (/) beside the number, second hit by turning the slash to an X, and the third by a circle (O) around the X. =Scoring= The object is for a player to hit each number and the bullseye three times. Doubles count as two hits and triples as three. The outer bullseye counts as one and the inner bullseye as two. The first player to hit a number three times owns that number and it is said to be opened. Further hits on the opened number score that number of points (e.g. triple 20 gains 60 points) until the opponent also hits that number three times and closes it, then that number is removed from play. The double ring scores double the number's value and the treble (inner) ring scores triple the number's value. The outer bullseye ring is worth 25 points and the inner circle (or double bull) is worth 50. Once a player has opened or closed all the required numbers and bull and has equal or more points than his opponent, that player wins. Also, if a player scores and does not record it before the next player goes, that score does not count. Alternatively, cut- throat style scoring can be used, in which case points are undesirable; hitting a number that is opened results in points being given to any other players who do not have that number closed, and the lowest score wins. =Playing= To start the game, each player or one player from each team throws one dart. This is known as the \\"diddle\\". The player whose dart lands closest to the center goes first. Generally, if both players' darts are in the same section of the bullseye, or in the event of a tie, each player throws another dart until there is an obvious winner. During a player's turn, the player throws three darts. After the last dart, the player's score is totaled. Any number that has not been hit three times (cumulative across all turns) by a player is neither open for that player nor closed (if currently open for the opponent). Example game * Player 1 opens the game by throwing a triple 20, then a single 20 and a double 18. At the end of Player 1's turn the 20 is opened and he has scored 20 points. The 18 will require one more hit to open it. The Score is 20 ‚Äì 0 (as the player hit an S20 after opening) * Player 2 throws next and hits a single 20, the triple 20 and a triple 16. At the end of Player 2's turn the 20 is closed, but he does not score since player 1 already opened it, and the 16 is opened. The Score is still 20 ‚Äì 0 (as player 2 closed the 20s and hitting a number that is closed does not score. The player also opened 16) * Player 1 now tries to open the 18s but hits the S1 and the S4 and the S9. At the end of player 1's second turn there is no score change. The Score is still 20 ‚Äì 0 (As only 15-20 & Bull are used in Cricket and 20 was closed by player 2) * Player 2 throws a triple 16, a single 19, and a double 19. At the end of player 2's second turn he has scored 48 points at the 16s and opened the 19s. The Score is 20 ‚Äì 48. * Player 2 can continue to score on the 16s and 19s on each of his turns until player 1 closes them. Play continues until all of the numbers have been opened (or closed) by the higher-scoring player. If one player/team is the only one with open numbers remaining and are also leading in points, the game can be called early as it is impossible for others to catch up. =Teams= This game can also be played by teams of 2 or even more persons. In some variations, when played with more than 2 teams, the system of points is replaced by penalty points, also known as cut-throat scoring. With penalty points the points score on every team that has not closed the number and the low point total wins the game. Cricket variations Multiple variations exist on the standard theme of hitting each number 3 times to close, followed by scoring points on closed numbers until all players have closed a given number. Standard scoring is the norm, but Cut-throat scoring may also be used in all variations where points are used rather than runs. =Scram= The Scram variation is played with 2 players or teams. As in standard Cricket, Scram can use all the numbers on the board minus the bulls- eye, the numbers 15 through 20 and the bull's-eye, or random number selections. Like with most dart games, 3 darts are thrown each turn per player. If teams are used, turns alternate between opposing players, i.e. Team 1, Player 1 -> Team 2, Player 1 -> Team 1, Player 2 -> Team 2, Player 2, etc. Numbers can be closed in the standard fashion i.e. hitting a single 3 times, hitting a double and a single, hitting a triple, etc. A closing variation, when using only the numbers 1-20, is a single hit on a number closes it out. Standard scoring is used, i.e. a triple 17 is worth 51 points. Player/Team 1 starts as the \\"Blocker\\" and Player/Team 2 as the \\"Scorer.\\" The Blocker throws first and attempts to close as many numbers as possible. The Scorer follows and attempts to score as many points as possible, on still open numbers, before the blocker can close all of the numbers. Once all the numbers have been closed, the round ends, and the Scorer tallies their points. The Players/Teams then switch roles and continue, with the new Blocker throwing first. The Player/Team with the most points is the winner. =Bowlers and Batters= The Bowlers and Batters variation, also known as English Cricket, uses all the numbers on the board, and is a two player/team game. Bowlers and Batters is very similar to Scram because the game is played in two separate rounds where the players have a specific role in each round. One player is designated a batter and the other is a bowler; the batter goes first. There are ten wickets assigned and it is the bowler's task to remove these wickets by hitting bull's-eyes: a single bull's-eye erases one wicket and a double bull erases two. The batter must score as many points as possible, while there are still wickets remaining, because only points over 40 are counted as runs, i.e. a score of 36 would score no runs, a score of 43, three runs, and a score of 58, 18 runs. The first round ends once the bowler has erased all ten wickets by hitting bull's-eyes. At this point the batter marks down the number of runs he scored, the players switch roles, and another round is played. The winner is the player who scores the most runs. There are always 2 innings - sometimes played over more than one day. This version of the game is more commonly known as Stick Arrows in the town of Poole and other parts of the South West of England. =Tactics= Tactics is the UK version of Cricket, and is almost the same as described above in Gameplay. However, Tactics, in addition to 20 through 15 and the bull's-eye, also uses Doubles and Triples as separate scoring objectives. Three of each number along with three bulls, three doubles, and three triples are required to complete the game. In addition the first player to close all objectives must have a tied score or better to win. There are two ways of playing Tactics, 'slop' and 'strict'. In Slop Rules Tactics, all doubles and triples count, while in Strict Tactics, only the doubles and triples from 15 through 20 count. The major tactical difference in game play between Tactics and Cricket is the introduction of Triples and Doubles as objectives. The player is offered a choice as to how these may be applied to his/her score. If 20 has been closed by only one player and that player hits the triple 20, they have the option of taking the 60 points, or applying this as one of their three required 'triple' hits. If 20 has been closed by both players, but triples have only been closed by one, that player can still use the hit to score 60 points on the triple 20. Other versions played in Canada and in the USA are similar to the above but using the numbers 20 down through 13 and 20 through 12 respectively. =Newfie Cricket, or \\"Faldo\\"= An alternate version of the game is played in Newfoundland, Canada, hence the name Newfie. This version is similar to the English variation called Faldo, in New Zealand this game is known as Shanghai. Along with each player needing to close 20 through 15, and the bull's-eye, it is required to hit three triples and three doubles. As with 20‚Äì15, once a player has closed his/her triples or doubles by hitting three of any type, they can point on the double or triple ring. For example, if a player were to hit triple 20 to open, he/she must decide whether to take three 20's (closing 20) or count one triple. For the triples and doubles it doesn't matter where they land, as long as they are on the ring. Hence, a triple 10 would count as 30 points if the player had already thrown three other triples to close them. In some cases in addition to doubles, triples and bulls, beds must also be closed. A bed is when all three darts from a single turn land in the same number. This version of cricket is also referred to as \\"Piggy\\" or \\"Marty Mouse.\\" =North-west England= This variation of the game is played especially in north-west England. Teams split into equal numbers of players and each team chooses one person to throw closest to the bullseye. Closest to the bullseye goes first and is the batting team. The object of the batting team is to score as many 'runs' as possible i.e. your score on each turn is your runs; 3 throws being your 'bat'. The 'bowling' team has to hit doubles, trebles or bullseyes to score a wicket; a double being 1 wicket, a treble being 2 wickets and a bullseye being 3 wickets, 3 throws being your 'bowl'. When the bowling team reaches 10 wickets, as is with cricket, the sides change and the game continues. The winning team is the team who scores the most runs before having lost all 10 wickets. =West Riding= A variation of this game is played in the West Riding of Yorkshire when the first to \\"bat\\" is decided by the first player to hit a double. The \\"batsman\\" has either 3 or 5 \\"wickets\\". The \\"bowler\\", in order to take a \\"wicket\\", must throw a double(s). The \\"batsman\\" must score over a previously agreed number (commonly 20 or 30) to score \\"runs\\". Only the excess of the agreed score counts as \\"runs\\" e.g. if the \\"batsman\\" throws a total of 58 (the agreed number for scoring being 30), then he would be credited with 28 runs. If he only scores 30 he would have no runs. The aim is to score as many as possible before all the \\"wickets\\" are lost. At this point, the players change roles and the winner is the one with most \\"runs\\". Doubles, trebles, bulls and outer bulls score as normal. = Twenty20 Darts Cricket = A more recent version of darts cricket, to take into account the rise of the Twenty20 form of the game, has been developed in Nottingham. The 'batting side' has 7 sets of 3 darts to score as many 'runs' as they can. The first 2 sets of darts are the 'powerplays' and count the full score, the following 5 sets of darts score half points, rounded up. Example score: Set 1; 20, 20, 1 (41 PTS) Set 2; 14, 40, 20 (74 PTS) Set 3; 20, 1, 5 (13 PTS) Set 4; 15, 3, 20 (19 PTS) Set 5; 60, 15, 15 (45 PTS) Set 6; 15, 20, 5 (20 PTS) Set 7; 14, 13, 24 (26 PTS) Total scored - 238 The 'bowler' has 6 sets of darts to take the ten wickets to bowl the batting side out. Wickets are taken by scoring either outer bull (2 Wickets) or bullseye (4 wickets). The beauty of the game is that once a player loses four wickets, they must throw one of their three darts with their non darts hand, losing six wickets means 2 darts with weak hand, and when 8 wickets are down all three must be thrown with the weak arm. This creates a real tension in run chases and can make for unbelievably tense finishes.

Blazon de Dion Marquis Jules F√©lix Philippe Albert de Dion de Wandonne (9 March 185619 August 1946) was a pioneer of the automobile industry in France. He invented a steam-powered car and used it to win the world's first auto race, but his vehicle was adjudged to be against the rules. He was a co-founder of De Dion-Bouton, the world's largest automobile manufacturer for a time, as well as the French sports newspaper L'√âquipe. His life Dion was the heir of a leading French noble family, in 1901 succeeding his father Louis Albert William Joseph de Dion de Wandonne as Count and later Marquis. A \\"notorious duellist\\", he also had a passion for mechanics. He had already built a model steam engine when, in 1881, he saw one in a store window and asked about building another. The engineers, Georges Bouton and his brother-in-law, Charles Tr√©pardoux, had a shop in L√©on where they made scientific toys. Needing money for Tr√©pardoux's long-time dream of a steam car, they acceded to De Dion's request. During 1883 they formed a partnership which became the De Dion-Bouton automobile company, the world's largest automobile manufacturer for a time. They tried marine steam engines, but progressed to a steam car which used belts to drive the front wheels whilst steering with the rear. This was destroyed by fire during trials. In 1884 they built another, \\"La Marquise\\", with steerable front wheels and drive to the rear wheels. As of 2011, it is the world's oldest running car, and is capable of carrying four people at up to . Comte de Dion entered one in an 1887 trial, \\"Europe's first motoring competition\\", the brainchild of M. Paul Faussier of cycling magazine Le V√©locip√®de Illustr√©. Evidently, the promotion was insufficient, for the de Dion was the sole entrant, but it completed the course. The de Dion tube (or 'dead axle') was actually invented by steam advocate Tr√©pardoux, just before he resigned because the company was turning to internal combustion. In 1898 he co-founded the Mondial de l'Automobile (Paris Motor Show). He died in 1946, age 90, and is buried in the cemetery at Montparnasse in Paris. There is a memorial plaque in the family chapel in Wandonne, south of Audincthun in the Pas-de-Calais. Racing career Motor racing was started in France as a direct result of the enthusiasm with which the French public embraced the motor car. Manufacturers were enthusiastic due to the possibility of using motor racing as a shop window for their cars. The first motor race took place on 22 July 1894 and was organised by Le Petit Journal, a Parisian newspaper. It was run over the distance between Paris and Rouen. The race was won by de Dion, although he was not awarded the prize for first place as his steam-powered car required a stoker and the judges deemed this outside of their objectives. Dreyfus affair The roots of both the Tour de France cycle race and L'Auto (L'√âquipe), a daily sporting newspaper, can be traced to the Dreyfus affair and de Dion's passionate opinion and actions regarding it. Opinions were heated and there were demonstrations by both sides in the Dreyfus affair. Historian Eugen Weber described an 1899 conflagration at the Auteuil horse-race course in Paris as \\"an absurd political shindig\\" when, among other events, the President of France (√âmile Loubet) was struck on the head by a walking stick wielded by de Dion. He served 15 days in jail and was fined 100 francs, and his behaviour was heavily criticised by Le V√©lo, the largest daily sports newspaper in France, and its Dreyfusard editor, Pierre Giffard. The result was that de Dion withdrew all his advertising from the paper, and in 1900 he led a group of wealthy 'anti- Dreyfusard' manufacturers, such as Adolphe Cl√©ment, to found L'Auto-Velo and compete directly with Le Velo. After a legally enforced change of name to L'Auto it in turn created the Tour de France race in 1903 to boost falling circulation. =L'Auto= In 1900 de Dion led a group of wealthy anti- Dreyfusards including √âdouard Michelin to start a rival daily sports paper, L'Auto-Velo. De Dion and Michelin were particularly concerned with Le V√©lo ‚Äì which reported more than cycling ‚Äì because its financial backer was one of their commercial rivals, the Darracq company. De Dion believed that Le V√©lo gave Darracq too much attention and him too little. De Dion was an outspoken man who already wrote columns for Le Figaro, Le Matin and others. His wealth allowed him to indulge his whims, which also included refounding Le Nain jaune (The Yellow Gnome), a fortnightly publication which \\"answers no particular need.\\" Notes References * Georgano, G.

The original German title is Eisenhans, a compound of Eisen \\"iron\\" and Hans (like English John, a common short form of the personal name Johannes). It represents Aarne‚ÄìThompson type 502, \\"The wild man as a helper\\".D.L. Ashliman, \\"The Grimm Brothers' Children's and Household Tales (Grimms' Fairy Tales)\\" Most people see the story as a parable about a boy maturing into adulthood. The story also became the basis for the book Iron John: A Book About Men by Robert Bly which spawned the mythopoetic men's movement in the early 1990s after spending 62 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list.

The King sends more men into the forest where they each meet with the same fate. The King sends all his remaining huntsmen out as a group, but again, none return. The king proclaims the woods as dangerous and off-limits to all. Some years later, a wandering explorer accompanied by a dog hears of these dangerous woods and asks permission to hunt in the forest, claiming that he might be able to discover the fate of the other hunters. The man and his dog are allowed to enter. As they come to a lake in the middle of the forest, the dog is dragged under water by a giant arm. The hunter returns to the forest the next day with a group of men to empty the lake. They find a naked man with iron-like skin and long shaggy hair all over his body. They capture him and he is locked in a cage in the courtyard as a curiosity. No one is allowed to set the wild man free or they will face the penalty of death. Years later, the young prince is playing with a ball in the courtyard. He accidentally rolls it into the cage where the wild iron-skinned man picks it up and will only return it if he is set free. He states further that the only key to the cage is hidden beneath the queen's pillow. Though the prince hesitates at first, he eventually builds up the courage to sneak into his mother's room and steal the key. He releases the wild iron-skinned man who reveals his name to be Iron John (or Iron Hans depending on the translation). The prince fears he will be killed for setting Iron John free, so Iron John agrees to take the prince with him into the forest. As it turns out, Iron John is a powerful being and has many treasures that he guards. He sets the prince to watch over his well, but warns him not to let anything touch it or fall in because it will turn instantly to gold. The prince obeys at first, but begins to play in the well, eventually turning all his hair into gold. Disappointed in the boy's failure, Iron John sends him away to experience poverty and struggle. Iron John also tells the prince that if he ever needs anything, simply to call the name of Iron John three times. The prince travels to a distant land and offers his services to its king. Since he is ashamed of his golden hair, he refuses to remove his cap before the king and is sent to assist the gardener. When war comes to the kingdom, the prince sees his chance to make a name for himself. He calls upon Iron John who gives him a horse, armor, and a legion of iron warriors to fight alongside him. The prince successfully defends his new homeland, but returns all that he borrowed to Iron John before returning to his former position. In celebration, the king announces a banquet and offers his daughter's hand in marriage to any one of the knights who can catch a golden apple that will be thrown into their midst. The king hopes that the mysterious knight who saved the kingdom will show himself for such a prize. Again the prince asks Iron John for help, and again Iron John disguises the prince as the mysterious knight. Though the prince catches the golden apple and escapes, and does so again on two more occasions, he is eventually found. The prince is returned to his former station, marries the princess, and is happily reunited with his parents. Iron John too comes to the wedding. This time, he is seen without the shaggy hair or iron skin that made him frightening. Iron John reveals he was under enchantment until he found someone worthy and pure of heart to set him free.

Retellings * Iron John was featured in Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics under its Iron Hans alias. * The story is featured as an episode of American McGee's Grimm, in which the tale is twisted into a Terminator-like setting. * An episode from the fourth season of Grimm titled \\"Iron Hans\\" is loosely based on the story, and the episode \\"Cat and Mouse\\", from the first season, uses a line from it as an opening quote. * The Iron John tale appears in Harry Harrison's The Stainless Steel Rat Sings The Blues as an allegory for children coming of age. * Anne Sexton wrote an adaptation as a poem called \\"Iron Hans\\" in her collection Transformations (1971), a book in which she re-envisions sixteen of the Grimm's Fairy tales.\\"Transformations by Anne Sexton\\" * Alphaville's 1994 song Iron John starts with a sketchy retelling of the first half of the story. The rest is about an opportunistic career in an unspecified profession in a more modern setting. Legacy In 1991, Robert Bly analyzed the story in Iron John: A Book About Men. Bly's reading analyzes the story for lessons about masculinity applicable to 20th-century men, and became a major work of the mythopoetic men's movement.

Born Tarbell was appointed midshipman on board of USS Constitution in the United States Navy on 5 December 1798. Tarbel became an officer in the rank of lieutenant on 25 August 1800.  First Barbary War  He served in Constitution and other ships of the Mediterranean Squadron from 1800 to 1804, at the height of America's war with Tripoli. Under Commodore Edward Preble's command, he took part in the 1804 blockade of Tripoli and was among those honored by Congress for services rendered during that action.  Between the wars  On 3 March 1805 Tarbell was promoted to master commandant. In 1808, he married Elizabeth Ann Cassin, who was Commodore John Cassin's daughter and Stephen Cassin's sister. After the war, in 1806, Tarbell was appointed master of the Washington Naval Yard. In 1811-1812 (maybe even until 1813), he was commanding the controversial repair of USS John Adams.  War of 1812  In 1813, Tarbell temporarily was appointed to command USS Constellation. He also was the commanding officer of the Gosport gunboat flotilla. From 19 to 23 June 1813 Tarbell commanded a boat expedition against the British squadron off Craney Island and in the James River. On the 20th his flotilla of fifteen gunboats had a 45-minute engagement with the British frigate Junon. The other British frigates joined the engagement forcing the American gunboats to retire.

He was commended by his superior, Commodore Stephen Cassin, and by the army officers ashore (Lt Col Henry Beatty) for his gallantry and assistance in the defense of Craney Island. On 23 July 1813, James Madison nominated Tarbell for the rank of captain effective 24 July 1813.  Death and legacy  Captain Tarbell died at Norfolk or Washington D.C., on 24 November 1815 and is buried at the Catholic burying ground of St. Patrick's Church.

It is named after Gaston Darboux who discovered it.. It is also called angular momentum vector, because it is directly proportional to angular momentum. In terms of the Frenet-Serret apparatus, the Darboux vector œâ can be expressed as. : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} = \\\\tau \\\\mathbf{T} + \\\\kappa \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (1) and it has the following symmetrical properties: : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{T} = \\\\mathbf{T'}, : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{N} = \\\\mathbf{N'}, : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mathbf{B'}, which can be derived from Equation (1) by means of the Frenet-Serret theorem (or vice versa). Let a rigid object move along a regular curve described parametrically by Œ≤(t). This object has its own intrinsic coordinate system. As the object moves along the curve, let its intrinsic coordinate system keep itself aligned with the curve's Frenet frame. As it does so, the object's motion will be described by two vectors: a translation vector, and a rotation vector œâ, which is an areal velocity vector: the Darboux vector. Note that this rotation is kinematic, rather than physical, because usually when a rigid object moves freely in space its rotation is independent of its translation. The exception would be if the object's rotation is physically constrained to align itself with the object's translation, as is the case with the cart of a roller coaster. Consider the rigid object moving smoothly along the regular curve. Once the translation is \\"factored out\\", the object is seen to rotate the same way as its Frenet frame. The total rotation of the Frenet frame is the combination of the rotations of each of the three Frenet vectors: : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} = \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\mathbf{T} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\mathbf{N} + \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\mathbf{B}. Each Frenet vector moves about an \\"origin\\" which is the centre of the rigid object (pick some point within the object and call it its centre). The areal velocity of the tangent vector is: : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\mathbf{T} = \\\\lim_{\\\\Delta t \\\\rightarrow 0} {\\\\mathbf{T}(t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{T}(t + \\\\Delta t) \\\\over 2 \\\\, \\\\Delta t} :: = {\\\\mathbf{T}(t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{T'}(t) \\\\over 2}. Likewise, : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\mathbf{N} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{N}(t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{N'}(t), : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\mathbf{B} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\ \\\\mathbf{B}(t) \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B'}(t). Now apply the Frenet-Serret theorem to find the areal velocity components: : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\mathbf{T} = {1\\\\over 2} \\\\mathbf{T} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{T'} = {1\\\\over 2}\\\\kappa \\\\mathbf{T} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{N} = {1\\\\over 2}\\\\kappa \\\\mathbf{B} : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\mathbf{N} = {1\\\\over 2}\\\\mathbf{N} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{N'} = {1\\\\over 2}(-\\\\kappa \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{T} + \\\\tau \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B}) = {1\\\\over 2}(\\\\kappa \\\\mathbf{B} + \\\\tau \\\\mathbf{T}) : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega}_\\\\mathbf{B} = {1\\\\over 2}\\\\mathbf{B} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{B'} = -{1\\\\over 2}\\\\tau \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\times \\\\mathbf{N} = {1\\\\over 2}\\\\tau \\\\mathbf{T} so that : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\omega} = {1\\\\over 2}\\\\kappa \\\\mathbf{B} + {1\\\\over 2}(\\\\kappa \\\\mathbf{B} + \\\\tau \\\\mathbf{T}) + {1\\\\over 2}\\\\tau \\\\mathbf{T} = \\\\kappa \\\\mathbf{B} + \\\\tau \\\\mathbf{T}, as claimed. The Darboux vector provides a concise way of interpreting curvature Œ∫ and torsion œÑ geometrically: curvature is the measure of the rotation of the Frenet frame about the binormal unit vector, whereas torsion is the measure of the rotation of the Frenet frame about the tangent unit vector.

Commissioned late in the war, she was initially assigned to transport duties and consequently did not participate in combat operations. Niagara was named after Fort Niagara, a fort captured from the British by American forces 28 November 1812; she was the eighth US Navy ship to bear the name. She was laid down 20 November 1944 under Maritime Commission contract by Consolidated Steel at Wilmington, California; launched 10 February 1945; acquired by the Navy 26 March 1945; and commissioned at San Pedro, California, 29 March 1945, Lt. Comdr. Allan C. Hoffman, USNR, in command. Operational history =World War II= Following amphibious warfare training out of San Diego, Niagara sailed 26 May 1945 with cargo and 887 Marines, whom she landed at Pearl Harbor 1 June. In the following weeks she transported troops, cargo, ammunition, and mail between the various Hawaiian Islands. She stood out of Pearl Harbor 1 July bound, via the Marshalls and Carolines, for Okinawa, arriving Buckner Bay 5 August. After debarking 903 Army troops and their combat support weapons and cargo, she departed 8 August with 40 officers and 771 men of the 81st Naval Construction Battalion for debarking at Guam in the Marianas. She arrived Apra Harbor on the morning of 15 August, the day of Japan's capitulation. =After hostilities= Niagara transported Navy passengers from Guam to the Philippines, arriving San Pedro Bay 20 August. She then set course for Cebu to embark the Army's 164th Regimental Combat Team, sailed 1 September, arrived Yokohama the 8th, and landed her occupation troops. She again headed for the Philippines 16 September to embark men of the Army's 305th Infantry, 77th Division, landed at Otaru, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan, 5 October. From there, she carried men of the Navy's 128th Construction Battalion to Apra Harbor. She stood out from Apra Harbor 22 October with an Army signal battalion bound for China. The attack transport reached Tientsin 29 October and sailed 10 November for the Marianas. Joining Operation Magic Carpet, the massive operation to return demobilizing servicemen, she embarked Army troops in Tanapag Harbor, Saipan, Marianas; sailed the 20th; and reached San Francisco 4 December. =Operation Crossroads= Niagara departed San Francisco 20 December for Samar, Philippine Islands, arriving 10 January 1946. While there, she received word that she would participate in the atomic bomb tests of Operation Crossroads as a unit of Joint Task Force 1. She put to sea 3 February to prepare at Pearl Harbor, then sailed to Bikini Atoll in the Marshalls, the location of the tests, arriving 31 May. A target ship, Niagara survived the atomic explosions of 1 and 25 July. She departed Bikini 21 August for and towed the battleship USS_Pennsylvania_(BB-38) to Kwajalein for tests, and Pearl Harbor en route to San Francisco, arriving 16 September. =Decommission= Niagara remained on the west coast until she departed San Diego 7 November, steaming via the Panama Canal to Hampton Roads, Virginia. She arrived Norfolk, Virginia on 2 December and decommissioned there 12 December 1946. After serving to test the effects of special conventional explosives in the Chesapeake Bay, Niagara was sold for scrapping on 5 February 1950 to the Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Reginald Horace Blyth (3 December 1898 ‚Äì 28 October 1964) was an English author and devotee of Japanese culture. He is most famous for his writings on Zen and on haiku poetry. Early life Blyth was born in Essex, England, the son of a railway clerk. He was the only child of Horace and Henrietta Blyth. He attended Cleveland Road Primary School, in Ilford, then the County High School (later Ilford County High School). In 1916, at the height of World War I, he was imprisoned at Wormwood Scrubs, as a conscientious objector, before working on the Home Office Scheme at Princetown Work Centre in the former and future Dartmoor Prison. After the war he attended the University of London, where he read English and from which he graduated in 1923, with honours. He adopted a vegetarian lifestyle which he maintained throughout his life. Blyth played the flute, made musical instruments, and taught himself several European languages. He was particularly fond of the music of J.S. Bach. In 1924, he received a teaching certificate from London Day Training College. The same year, he married Anna Bercovitch, a university friend. Some accounts say they moved to India, where he taught for a while until he became unhappy with British colonial rule, other scholars dismiss this episode, claiming it to have been invented or misunderstood by Blyth's mentor Daisetz T. Suzuki.Pinnington 1994, p254; Kirkup 1994, p5; Suzuki, dust jacket Blyth, Zen Classics Vol. 4 Korea (1925‚Äì1935) In 1925, the Blyths moved to Korea (then under Japanese rule), where Blyth became Assistant Professor of English at Keijo University in Seoul. While in Korea, Blyth began to learn Japanese and Chinese, and studied Zen under the master Hanayama Taigi of My≈çshin-ji Keijo Betsuin (Seoul). In Korea he started to read D. T. Suzuki's books about Zen. In 1933, he informally adopted a Korean student, paying for his studies in Korea and later at London University. His wife parted from him in 1934 and Blyth took one-year absence from the university in 1935, following her to England. After the divorce, Blyth returned to Korea in early 1936, leaving the adopted son with his ex-wife. The adopted son returned after World War II to Korea. In 1947 he was captured by North Korean soldiers; when he returned to the South, he was shot as a traitor by the South Korean army.Pinnington 1994, p254; Kirkup 1994, p6 Japan (1936‚Äì1964) Having returned to Seoul in 1936, Blyth remarried in 1937, to a Japanese woman named Kijima Tomiko,UEDA Munakata Kuniyoshi, A Short Introduction to R.H.

T. Suzuki's home town, in Japan, and Blyth took a job as English teacher at the Fourth Higher School (later Kanazawa University). When Britain declared war on Japan in December 1941, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, bringing Japan into World War II, Blyth was interned as a British enemy alien. Although he expressed his sympathy for Japan and sought Japanese citizenship, this was denied. During his internment his extensive library was destroyed in an air raid. In the internment camp in Kobe he finished his first book Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics and wrote parts of his books about haiku and senryu. He also met in the camp Robert Aitken, later Roshi of the Diamond Sangha in Honolulu. After the war, Blyth worked diligently with the authorities, both Japanese and American, to ease the transition to peace. Blyth functioned as liaison to the Japanese Imperial Household, and his close friend, Harold Gould Henderson, was on General Douglas MacArthur's staff. Together, they helped draft the declarationDower 1999, p310 Ningen Sengen, by which Emperor Hirohito declared himself to be a human being, and not divine. By 1946, Blyth had become Professor of English at Gakushuin University, and became private tutor to the Crown Prince (later emperor) Akihito until the end of his [Blyth's] life.Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.3, p70 He did much to popularise Zen philosophy and Japanese poetry (particularly haiku) in the West. In 1954, he was awarded a doctorate in literature from Tokyo University, and, in 1959, he received the Zuih≈çsh≈ç (Order of Merit) Fourth Grade.Pinnington 1994; Kirkup 1994 Blyth died in 1964, probably of a brain tumour and complications from pneumonia, in the Seiroka Hospital in Tokyo. He was buried in the cemetery of the Shokozan Tokei Soji Zenji Temple in Kamakura, next to his old friend, D. T. Suzuki. Blyth's posthumous Buddhist name is Bulaisu Kodo Shoshin Koju. Blyth's tomb in Kamakura. He left the following death poem: :Sazanka ni kokoro nokoshite tabidachinu :I leave my heart :to the sasanqua flower :on the day of this journey  Work  Blyth produced a series of work on Zen, Haiku & Senryu, and on other forms of Japanese and Asian literature. He wrote six books on Haiku (1949‚Äì52, 1963‚Äì64) and two books on Senryu (1949, 1960), four books on Humour in Asian and English Literature (1957, 1959(a), 1959(b), 1961), as well as seven books on Zen (1942, 1952, 1960‚Äì64; posthumous 1966, 1970). Further publications include studies of English Literature (1942, 1957, 1959(b)) and a three-fifths shortened version of A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers by his favourite author Henry David Thoreau, along with an introduction and explanatory notes. The most significant publications being his four-volume Haiku Series (1949‚Äì52), his 'Zen in English Literature and Oriental Classics' and his five-volume Zen Series. Nearly all of his books were published in Japan, by Hokuseido Press, Tokyo.  Blyth and Zen  The actual 5-volume 'Zen and Zen Classics' series is a modification by the publishers, caused by the unexpected death of Blyth, of the originally planned 8-volume project, which included a translation of the Hekiganroku (Piyenchi), a History of Korean Zen and of Japanese Zen (Dogen, Hakuin etc.) and a renewed edition of his 'Buddhist Sermons on Christian Texts' as Vol. 8; ( as a result of the modification the already published Vol. 7 was reprinted as Vol. 5).Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.1, 2, 4 (dust jackets) According to D.T. Suzuki the Zen-Series should have been \\"the most complete work on Zen to be presented so far to the English-reading public\\".Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.4 (dust jacket) The First Volume presents a General Introduction from the Upanishads to Huineng, Vol. Two and Three a History of Zen from the Seigen Branch to Nangaku Branch and Vol. Five Twenty-Five Zen Essays. In Vol. Four Blyth translates the Mumonkan (Wumenkuan). Blyth's Mumonkan was the third complete translation into English, but the first one which was accompanied by extensive interpretive commentaries on each case. Blyth's early publication ‚ÄòZen in English Literature and Oriental Classics', published 1942 when he was interned in Japan during World War II, and his Zen and Zen Classics Series exerted a significant influence on the Western Writers‚Äô- and Zen-community, although nearly all of his books were published in Japan only.

Next, the biggest bit of luck of all, Zen, through the books of Suzuki Daisetz ... Last but not least there appeared senryu, which might well be dignified by the term Senryu no Michi, the Way of Senryu, for it is an understanding of all things by laughing and smiling at them, and this means forgiving all things, ourselves and God included\\".Blyth 1960, preface Blyth wrote six books on haiku and four books on humour and senryu, the genre sister of haiku: 'In haiku things speak for themselves with the voice of a man, in senryu things do not speak; we speak and speak for ourselves',Blyth 1960, p269 in senryu the world is 'not seen as God made it' but 'as man sees it';Blyth, Senryu 1949, p41; Blyth 1960, p465 'to haiku, sex hardly exists; to senryu, it is all pervading ... a great many deal with the subject of the Yoshiwara...'Blyth, Senryu 1949, p37f After early imagist interest in haiku the genre drew less attention in English, until after World War II, with the appearance of a number of influential volumes about Japanese haiku. In 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of Haiku, Blyth's four- volume work, haiku was introduced to the post-war Western world. His Haiku series (1949‚Äì52) was dealing mostly with pre-modern haiku, though including Shiki; later followed his two-volume History of Haiku (1963‚Äì64). Today he is best known as a major interpreter of haiku & senryu to English speakers. Many contemporary Western writers of haiku were introduced to the genre through his Zen-based haiku explanations. These include the San Francisco and Beat Generation writers, Gary SnyderSnyder 2005; Suiter 2002, p21, p47, Philip Whalen, Jack KerouacKerouac 1958; (w. Gary Snyder as Japhy Ryder) and Allen Ginsberg, as well as J. D. Salinger (\\"...particularly haiku, but senryu, too...can be read with special satisfaction when R. H. Blyth was on them. Blyth is sometimes perilous, naturally, since he's a highhanded old poem himself, but he's also sublime\\")Salinger (c.1955 and 1959;c.1963) 1991, p118, and p67; for 'poem himself'. quoting Milton, see Blyth 1942, p264; for Blyth's definition of 'sentimentality' see Blyth (1949-52) Vol.2, p229 and Updike 1961, Octavio PazPaz 1988 (c.1968), notes, p.648; Paz 1954, E. E. CummingsWelch 1995, and (probably) Luke Rhinehart. Many members of the international \\"haiku community\\" also got their first views of haiku from Blyth's books, including American author James W. Hackett (born 1929), Eric Amann, William J. Higginson, Anita Virgil, Jane Reichhold, and Lee Gurga. The French philosopher and semiotician Roland Barthes read 1967 Blyth's 4 Vol. set, using it for lectures and seminars on haiku 1979.Barthes 2010, Sessions January 6, 1979 to February 24,1979 (in the Index Nominum see Robert (sic!) H. Blyth); Samoyault 2016, Chap. 12. For bibliographical confusions, Barthes 2010, p415n24 Some noted Blyth's distaste for haiku on more modern themes, some his strong bias regarding a direct connection between haiku and Zen,see also Suzuki 1959, Chap. VII, and Barthes 1970 a connection largely ignored by modern Japanese poets. Bash≈ç, in fact, felt that his devotion to haiku prevented him from realising enlightenment;Makoto Ueda 1967; see also Blyth (1949-52) Vol.4, pp95 and classic Japanese haiku poets like Chiyo-ni, Buson, and Issa were Pure Land (Jodo) rather than Zen Buddhists.see Blyth (1949-52) Vol.3, p231f., 433, 435f., Vol.2, 363 Some also noted, that Blyth did not view haiku by Japanese women favourably, that he was downplaying their contribution to the genre, especially during the Bash≈ç era. In the chapter 'Women Haiku Writers' Blyth writes: \\"Haiku for women, like Zen for women, - this subject makes us once more think about what haiku are, and a woman is‚Ä¶Women are said to be intuitive, and as they cannot think, we may hope this is so, but intuition‚Ä¶is not enough‚Ä¶ [it] is doubtfull... whether women can write haiku\\"Blyth (1963-64) Vol.1, p.207, p223 Although Blyth did not foresee the appearance of original haiku in languages other than Japanese when he began writing on the topic, and although he founded no school of verse, his works stimulated the writing of haiku in English. At the end of the second volume of his History of Haiku, he remarked 1964 that \\"The latest development in the history of haiku is one which nobody foresaw... the writing of haiku outside Japan, not in the Japanese language.\\"Blyth (1963-64) Vol.2, p349 He followed that comment with a number of original verses in English by Hackett with whom Blyth corresponded. Blyth: \\"How about my own [haiku] explanations? Some say they are better than many of the original haiku. Some say they should be omitted. I myself agree with both views\\".Blyth (1963-64) Vol.2, p347  Blyth's Zen  > \\"Incidentally, I first heard the term \\"Blyth's Zen\\" ... when Roshi asked, > \\"Who was your Zen teacher?\\" I told Soen Roshi that ... for incorporating Zen > values in my haiku, I was a disciple of R.

To this, Roshi murmered > a long \\"Hmmmmmmm.....\\", then said \\"Blyth's Zen, eh?\\"Hackett 2002 \\"We must > never forget that the one thing in the world that is not a thing is Zen. > International, transcendental, pure super-Zen has no existence.

It has no view of society, no idea of human progress, material or spiritual. It is always all things to all men, and will support any government, fascistic or communistic or democratic. Its organization is unchangeable feudalistic, though on special occasions it has an All Fools' Day when an absolute equality is de rigueur.

A system of doctrine, rules of morality, and above all the Sangha itself means religious mass suicide‚Ä¶the Indian hatred of women persisted; sex was omitted, and the monastery could not be self-subsisting, since new members were constantly needed. Thus the life of the Zen monastery, however earnest and active it may have once been, was always a farce‚Ä¶Zen has not yet taught us how to be fathers and mothers and citizens. It is still a thing for monks, at least for men, and especially for old men\\"Blyth, Zen Classics Vol.1, p18 * \\"The least admirable part of Buddhisms is its attitude to sex.

Archibald Hamilton (c. 1790 ‚Äì 15 January 1815) was the son of Secretary of the Navy Paul Hamilton, and an officer in the United States Navy during the War of 1812. Hamilton was appointed Midshipman on 18 May 1809 and assigned to work with a new kind of hollow shot needed by frigate President. He next sailed for Europe in John Adams on 31 January 1811 carrying dispatches for American officers in the Mediterranean. On his return to the United States, Hamilton was assigned to United States on which he won high commendation from his commanding officer, Captain Stephen Decatur, for gallantry in action during the capture of British frigate Macedonian on 25 October 1812. Decatur selected him to bear the captured British flags to Washington. Appointed Acting Lieutenant 21 December 1812 and Lieutenant 24 July 1813, Hamilton served with distinction throughout the War of 1812, only to be killed shortly after the Treaty of Ghent had formally ended the war. Because of the slow communications of the day, word of peace had not reached New York by 15 January 1815 when frigate President, commanded by Captain Decatur and having Hamilton as one of her lieutenants, ran the blockade out of that port. The next day British men-of-war Endymion, Pomone and Tenedos overtook and captured President after a long and bloody running fight in which Hamilton was killed. He was the last U.S. Navy officer to die in the War of 1812. Namesake USS Hamilton (DD-141) was named for him.

Use of force doctrines can be employed by law enforcement officers and military personnel on guard duty. The aim of such doctrines is to balance the needs of security with ethical concerns for the rights and well-being of intruders or suspects. Injuries to civilians tend to focus attention on self-defense as a justification and, in the event of death, the notion of justifiable homicide. U.S. military personnel on guard duty are given a \\"use of force briefing\\" by the sergeant of the guard before being assigned to their post. For the English law on the use of force in crime prevention, see Self-defence in English law. The Australian position on the use of troops for civil policing is set out by Michael Hood in Calling Out the Troops: Disturbing Trends and Unanswered Questions;http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/2005/33.html compare \\"Use of Deadly Force by the South African Police Services Re-visited\\" by Malebo Keebine-Sibanda and Omphemetse Sibanda. History Use of force dates back to the beginning of established law enforcement, with a fear that officers would abuse their power. In today's society this fear still exists and one of the ways to fix this problem is to require police to wear body cameras and to have them turned on during all interactions with civilians. Use of force continuum The use of force may be standardized by a use of force continuum, which presents guidelines as to the degree of force appropriate in a given situation. One source identifies five very generalized steps, increasing from least use of force to greatest. It is only one side of the model, as it does not give the levels of subject resistance that merit the corresponding increases in force. Each successive level of force is meant to describe an escalating series of actions an officer may take to resolve a situation, and the level of force used rises only when a lower level of force would be ineffective in dealing with the situation. Typically any style of a use of force continuum will start with officer presence, and end with the use of deadly force. #Presence (using the effect of the presence of an authority figure on a subject) #Verbalization (commanding a subject) #Empty hand control (using empty hands to search, relieve weapons, immobilize, or otherwise control a subject) #Intermediate weapons (using non-lethal chemical, electronic or impact weapons on a subject) #Deadly Force (using any force likely to cause permanent injury or death to a subject) Use of force continuums can be further broken down. Use of force continuums are an illustration of the broad spectrum of force that a law enforcement officer may use. However, the officer's use of force is governed by the US Constitution and clearly established case law, not a use of force continuum. U.S. case law =Graham v. Connor (1989)= On November 12, 1984, Graham, who was a diabetic, felt an insulin reaction coming on and rushed to the store with a friend to get some orange juice. When the store was too crowded, he and his friend proceeded to go to another friend's house. In the midst of all this, he was being watched by Officer Connor, of the Charlotte City Police Department police department. While on their way to the friend's house, the officer stopped the two of them and called for backup. After several other officers arrived, one of them handcuffed Graham. Eventually, when Connor learned that nothing had happened in the convenience store, the officers drove Graham home and released him. Over the course of the encounter, Graham sustained a broken foot, cuts on his wrists, a bruised forehead and an injured shoulder. In the resulting case, Graham v. Connor (1989), the Supreme Court held that it was irrelevant whether Connor acted in good faith, because the use of force must be judged based on its objective reasonableness. In determining the \\"objective reasonableness\\" of force, the court set out a series of three factors: \\"the severity of the crime\\", \\"whether there is an immediate threat to the safety of officers or others\\", and \\"Whether the suspect is actively resisting arrest or evading\\".https://www.policeone.com/police- products/firearms/articles/1271618-How-police-officers-can-avoid-claims-of- excessive-force/ citing Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989) =Tennessee v. Garner (1985)= On October 3, 1974, Officers Elton Hymon and Leslie Wright of the Memphis Police Department were called to respond to a possible burglary. When they arrived to the scene, a woman standing on the porch began to tell them that she heard glass breaking and that she believed the house next door was being broken into. Officer Hymon went to check, where he saw Edward Garner, who was fleeing the scene. As Garner was climbing over the gate, Hymon called out \\"police, halt\\", and when Garner failed to do so, Hymon fatally shot Garner in the back of the head, despite being \\"reasonably sure\\" that Garner was unarmed. The Supreme Court held, in Tennessee v. Garner, that deadly force may be used to prevent the escape of a fleeing felon only if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a serious risk to the officer or to others. =Payne v. Pauley (2003) = Payne v. Pauley is a case in the Seventh Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that the use of force must be both reasonable and actually necessary to avoid an excessive force complaint.https://www.policeone.com/police- products/firearms/articles/1271618-How-police-officers-can-avoid-claims-of- excessive-force/Payne v. Pauley, 337 F.3d 767, (7th Cir. 2003) =Nelson v. City of Davis (2004)= On April 16, 2004, what was supposed to be known as the \\"biggest party in history\\" took place at the annual UC Davis picnic. Due to the large number of participants at this party, people began to illegally park their cars. Sgt. John Wilson demanded that officers start to issue parking tickets to the illegally parked cars. Tickets were also issued to the underage drinkers. Wilson called the owner of the apartment complex because of the disturbances that were being caused; loud music and the sounds of bottles breaking. Wilson was consented by the complex apartment owner to have non- residents to leave the complex. 30 to 40 officers were rounded up with riot gear - including pepper ball guns - to try to disperse the crowd of 1,000 attendees. The officers gathered in front of the complex where 15 to 20 students, including Timothy C. Nelson, were attempting to leave, but no instructions were given by the police. Officers began to fire pepper-balls, one of which struck Nelson in the eye. He collapsed immediately and was taken to the hospital much later on, where he suffered multiple injuries including temporary blindness and a permanent loss of visual acuity. He endured multiple surgeries to try to repair the injury. Nelson lost his athletic scholarship due to his injury and was forced to withdraw from UC Davis. The officers were unable to find any criminal charges against Nelson. The Ninth Circuit held that the use of force was unreasonable and the officers were not entitled to qualified immunity. = Plumhoff v. Rickard (2014) = On July 18, 2014, a West Memphis police officer stopped Donald Rickard for a broken headlight. As the officer talked with Rickard he noticed that there was an indentation in the windshield and that Rickard was acting very erratic. The officer asked Rickard to step out of the vehicle. Rickard at that point fled the scene. A high speed chase ensued, which involved several other officers. Rickard lost control of his vehicle in a parking lot, and officers exited their vehicles to approach Rickard. Rickard again tried to flee, hitting several police cruisers and nearly hitting several officers. At this time officers opened fire on Rickard. The officers fired a total of 15 rounds which resulted in the death of both Rickard and his passenger. The Supreme Court ruled that the use of force was justified, because the objective reasonableness of the use of deadly force must be based on the situation in which it was used, and not on hindsight.Plumhoff v. Rickard, 134 S. Ct. 2012, 572 U.S., 188 L. Ed. 2d 1056 (2014).  U.S. statistics  Of the 40 million people in the United States who had face to face contact with the police 1.4%, or 574,000, reported use of force or the threat of use of force being directed at them. About a quarter of the 574,000 incidents involved the police officer pointing the gun at the subject of the incident and 53.5% of the incidents saw the officer using physical force such as kicking, grabbing, and pushing. In addition, 13.7% of those that had force used against them or were threatened with the use of force submitted complaints to the offending officer's department. Of those that received use of force from a police officer or were threatened with use of force almost 75% reported that they believed it was excessive and unwarranted. This statistic was consistent across the Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic races.U.S. Department of Justice. (2011). Contacts Between Police and the Public, 2008. (NCJ 234599). Washington, DC. A report by the Washington Post found that 385 Americans were fatally shot by law enforcement officers in the first five months of 2015, an average of more than two fatal shootings a day, which was more than twice the rate reported in official statistics. 221 of those killed were armed with guns, and 68 were armed with knives or other blades. Officer attributes =Education= Studies have shown that law enforcement personnel with some college education (typically two-year degrees) use force much less often than those with little to no higher education. In events that the educated officers do use force, it is usually what is considered \\"reasonable\\" force. Despite these findings, very little - only 1% - of police forces within the United States have education requirements for those looking to join their forces. Some argue that police work deeply requires experience that can only be gained from actually working in the field. =Experience= It is argued that the skills for performing law enforcement tasks well cannot be produced from a classroom setting. These skills tend to be better gained through repeated exposure to law enforcement situations while in the line of work. The results as to whether or not the amount of experience an officer has contributes to the likelihood that they will use force differ among studies. = Other characteristics = It has not been strongly found that the race, class, gender, age etc. of an officer affects the likelihood that they will use force. Situational factors may come into play.  Split-second syndrome Split-second syndrome is an example of how use of force can be situation-based. Well-meaning officers may resort to the use of force too quickly under situations where they must make a rapid decision. Departmental attributes Policies on use of force can differ between departments. The type of policies established and whether or not they are enforced can affect an officer's likeliness to use force. If policies are established, but not enforced heavily by the department, the policies may not make a difference. For example, the Rodney King case was described as a problem with the departmental supervision not being clear on policies of (excessive) force. Training offered by the department can be a contributing factor, as well, though it has only been a recent addition to include information on when to use force, rather than how to use force. One departmental level policy that is currently being studied and called for by many citizens and politicians is the use of body cameras by officers. In one study body cameras were shown to reduce the use of force by as much as 50%.  Crime levels  At the micro level, violent crime levels in the neighborhood increase the likelihood of law enforcement use of force. In contrast, at the meso level violent neighborhood crime does not have that much effect on use of force. England and Wales In England and Wales the use of (reasonable) force is provided to police and any other person from Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967, which states: \\"A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime, or in effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders or of persons unlawfully at large\\". Use of force may be considered lawful if it was, on the basis of the facts as the accused honestly believed them,CPS: Self- Defence and the Prevention of Crime necessary and reasonable. (Further provision about when force is \\"reasonable\\" was made by section 76 of the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008.)

It contains an account of a post-crucifixion appearance in Galilee, which the text describes as the third time Jesus had appeared to his disciples. In the course of this chapter, there is a miraculous catch of 153 fish, the confirmation of Peter's love for Jesus, a foretelling of Peter's death in old age, and a comment about the beloved disciple's future.  Text  The original text was written in Koine Greek. This chapter is divided into 25 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Papyrus 66 (c.

He revealed himself this way. WEB In the previous chapter of John's Gospel, the text summarizes the many signs which Jesus performed for his followers, not all of which could be recorded in the Gospel. John 21 begins with the 'Johannine transition', After these things... () which is used frequently in the Fourth Gospel, leading some scholars to suggest that John 21 was appended in the same way as Mark 16:9‚Äì20. Peter's ecclesiastical role is emphasized, but this is similar to Peter's commissioning in John 1. Westcott proposed a theory that the author simply decided to add an additional incident at some time after writing the book, but before final publication. Donald Guthrie writes: > It is unlikely that another author wrote this section since there are > several points of contact in it with the style and language of previous > chapters...(IVP New Bible Commentary) The Church Father Tertullian wrote, \\"And wherefore does this conclusion of the gospel affirm that these things were written unless it is that you might believe, it says, that Jesus Christ is the son of God?\\", which describes the end of Chapter 20, not Chapter 21. However, no existing manuscript of the Gospel omits this chapter. Helmut Koester, Introduction to the New Testament (Walter de Gruyter 2000 ) vol. 2, p. 192Chris Keith, The Pericope Adulterae, the Gospel of John, and the Literacy of Jesus (Brill 2009 ), p. 258 =Manuscript evidence= The Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece (27th ed.) as well as major translations of the New Testament (e.g. KJV, NASB, NIV, RSV, NRSV) retain this chapter in their editions as original. In an essay, contributed on behalf of scholars unconvinced of any decisive sense of \\"originality\\" to John 21 (published in 2007), Felix Just wrote: \\"We (unfortunately!) do not possess any ancient manuscript of John that actually ends at .\\" Felix Just, 'Combining Key Methodologies in Johannine Studies', in Tom Thatcher (ed), What We Have Heard from the Beginning: The Past, Present, and Future of Johannine Studies, (Baylor University Press, 2007), p. 356. In other words, ancient manuscripts that contain the end of John 20 also contain text from John 21. So if John 21 is an addition, it was so early (which is not in doubt: part of John 21 appears in P66) and so widespread, that no evidence of the prior form has survived. This should however be balanced against the tendency for the first and last pages of codices to be lost: there are just four papyrus witnesses to John 20‚Äì21, only three of which date from the 4th century or earlier.Papyri and Manuscripts related to the Gospel and Epistles of John in The Johannine Literature Web at Catholic-Resources.org. Novum Testamentum Graece (NA28) and the United Bible Societies (UBS5) provide the critical text for John 21.Nestle-Aland Novum Testamentum Graece, Jn 21 In 2006 one 4th-century Sahidic papyrus manuscript (Bodleian MS. Copt.e.150(P)) came to light that it may end at 20:31,Gesa Schenke, 'Das Erscheinen Jesu vor den J√ºngern und der ungl√§ubige Thomas: Johannes 20, 19‚Äì31' in Louis Painchaud and Paul-Hubert Poirier, eds, Coptica ‚Äì Gnostica ‚Äì Manichaica: M√©langes offerts √† Wolf-Peter Funk (Les presses de l'Universit√© Laval / Peeters, 2006) pp. 893‚Äì904. but this is not conclusive due to its fragmentary state. The Disciple whom Jesus loved The description of the \\"beloved disciple's\\" (normally assumed to be John the Apostle) fate is presented as an aside to Peter. Jesus says that it is not Peter's concern, even if Jesus should wish that that disciple remain alive until the end of time. The following verse clarifies that Jesus did not say \\"This disciple will not die\\", but that it was not for Peter to know. The last appearance of the 'Disciple whom Jesus loved' in this Gospel, together with his first appearance in chapter 1 form a literary \\"inclusio of eyewitness testimony\\" to privilege this witness (in the Gospel of John 21:24) over Peter's, not to denigrate Peter's authority, but rather to claim a distinct qualification as an 'ideal witness' to Christ, because he survives Peter and bears his witness after Peter.Bauckham, R. \\"The Beloved Disciple as Ideal Author,\\" JNST 49 (1993) 21-44; reprinted in S. E. Porter and C. A. Evans, eds., The Johannine Writings (Biblical Seminar 32; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic, 1995) 46-68; apud Bauckham 2017, p. 128 The inclusio also reinforces the Beloved Disciple‚Äôs unique status among the disciples: He has followed and remained with Jesus from beginning to end. James L. Resseguie, ‚ÄúThe Beloved Disciple: The Ideal Point of View,‚Äù in Character Studies in the Fourth Gospel: Narrative Approaches to Seventy Figures in John, ed. Steven A. Hunt, D. Francois Tolmie and Ruben Zimmermann (T√ºbingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2013); reprint (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2016), 548. Bauckham notes the occurrence of at least two specific words in the narratives of both the first and the last appearance of this disciple: \\"to follow\\" (Greek: ) and \\"to remain/stay\\" (Greek: ). In the first chapter verse it is stated that \\"Jesus turned, and seeing them following ('akolouthountas'), said to them, \\"What do you seek?\\"\\", then in verse they \\"remained ('emeinan') with Him that day\\". In John 21, the last appearance of the 'Disciple whom Jesus loved' is indicated using similar words: in verse it is written that \\"Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following ('akolouthounta')\\", then in verse \\"Jesus said to him [Peter], \\"If I will that he remain ('menein') till I come, what is that to you?\\" The appearances are also close to Peter's, as the first one, along with Andrew, happened just before Peter's, who was then given the name 'Cephas' (alluding to Peter's role after Jesus' departure), and the last one, just after Jesus' dialogue with Peter, acknowledging the significance of Peter's testimony within \\"the Petrine's inclusio\\", which is also found in the Gospel of Mark and Luke (see Luke 8 under \\"The Women who sustained Jesus\\"). Verses 24‚Äì25 The chapter (and the whole book) is closed by two verses referring to the author of the gospel in the third person (\\"We know that his testimony is true\\"). = Verse 24 = :This is the disciple who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.

Although generally a very nice and handsome guy, Fred can be bossy at times and will force Shaggy and Scooby to hang around until the mystery is solved. According to Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes, his boyhood nickname was \\"Pickle\\". He was voted \\"Best Looking\\" in school and was once part of a performance troupe before he devoted himself to solving mysteries. With his dramatic studies, Fred is an expert of getting into the mind of the villains he and his friends face. He sings songs from Show Boat to his friends whenever feel exceptionally scared; Daphne claims it soothes them. Fred one day hopes to become a mystery writer where he can put all of his talents to the fullest. In A Pup Named Scooby-Doo, Fred was depicted as being somewhat less intelligent and was often believing in crazy conspiracy theories and legends such as Bigfoot and mole people and liked reading a Coolsville-based magazine called The National Exaggerator which his uncle, Eddie Jones, eventually bought. In each episode, Fred would (often incorrectly) blame the crime on the neighborhood bully, Red Herring (a play on the idiom red herring). This more ditsy and scatterbrained version of Fred was also carried over to What's New, Scooby-Doo? but without his supernatural beliefs. In this teenage version, he is shown to have many interests (obsessions for traps, martial arts, wrestling, and weightlifting). =Development= Fred Jones was inspired by the titular character of the late 1950s/early 1960s American sitcom The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis, as played by Dwayne Hickman. Some network sales presentation art from an early version of Scooby-Doo, entitled Who's S-S- Scared?, featured early designs of Fred with brown hair; Originally named \\"Ronnie\\" when production for Scooby-Doo began in spring 1969, Fred was named by and after Fred Silverman, who was then head of daytime programming at CBS and a key member of the show's development team.(2006). Interview with Ken Spears. Eerie Mystery of Scooby-Doo and Dynomutt's History. Excerpt: \\"That character [Fred] started out... I think his name was 'Geoff'... and then he became 'Harvey'. And then all of a sudden, Fred [Silverman] came in and said [the character] was going to be 'Fred'. So, I guess he had something to do with that.\\" Frank Welker, a young comedian and impressionist, was asked by the network to audition for the voice of Fred, although he had originally intended to audition for first Scooby-Doo (whom he eventually did get to voice after Don Messick died in 1997) and later Shaggy (Casey Kasem, who was cast as Shaggy, had originally wanted to voice Fred).(2001).

Jared is a graduate of Burton Elementary School located in Kaysville, Utah, which he attended while living in Fruit Heights during his youth. He also attended Manhattan High School in Kansas for two years, before transferring to Preston High School, from which he graduated in 1997. Many scenes from Napoleon Dynamite were filmed there. As a teenager Jared worked in film production with T. C. Christensen. Career Jared met Jerusha while attending Brigham Young University's (BYU) film school. Together they co-wrote the film Napoleon Dynamite, which was produced and edited by their classmate Jeremy Coon. While at BYU, Jared wrote and directed a student film entitled Cardboard Only, which is about a seven-year-old Idaho farm boy who struggles to escape boredom while wearing a cardboard box over his head. While at BYU, Jared also wrote and directed a short film entitled Peluca, which became a prototype for Napoleon Dynamite and featured much of the same cast and plotline, including Jon Heder as Seth, \\"super nerd extraordinaire.\\" Besides his efforts on Napoleon Dynamite and Peluca, Jared has worked as a camera assistant in a number of films and has played minor roles in a few Latter-day Saint comedies.

In 2010, Jared created ads for the Utah State Fair which were run on the radio, but refused on television. The Utah State Fair representatives claimed they refused to run them due to sexual overtones, while Hess claimed the failure to run the ads was because the main actor in them, Marcus T.

He was a co-ruler with his father, King Magnus IV, from 1356 until his death in 1359. Referring to Erik Magnusson as King Eric XII is a later invention, counting backwards from Eric XIV (1560‚Äì68). He and his brother Charles IX (1604‚Äì1611) adopted numerals according to a fictitious history of Sweden. The number of Swedish monarchs named Eric before Eric XIV (at least seven) is unknown, going back into prehistory, and none of them used numerals. It would be speculative to try to affix a mathematically accurate one to this king. Biography Erik was the son of King Magnus Eriksson (1316‚Äì1374) and the grandson of Eric, Duke of S√∂dermanland (c. 1282‚Äì1318). In 1343 Eric and his brother, Haakon, were elected heirs to the thrones of Sweden and Norway, respectively. He was married to Beatrix of Bavaria (1344-1359) ,daughter of Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor. H√•kon received the Norwegian throne in 1355 and this led to the prior union between those countries being dissolved. In 1357 a Swedish rebellion forced King Magnus to share the rule of Sweden with his son Erik, who was allowed domain over most of Scania and Finland. Joint rule of Sweden was established again in 1359 when father and son became reconciled and co-ruled Sweden until Eric's death a few months later. Quite soon after his death his wife, Beatrix, died as well. It is generally believed that they both died of the Black Death.

In the 2011 census, its population was 3,227. The village of Minsterley is just over a mile further southwest. The A488 road runs through the village, on its way from Shrewsbury to Bishop's Castle. The Rea Brook flows close by to the north with the village itself nestling on the northern edge of the Shropshire Hills AONB. Shropshire County Council in their current Place Plan detail the development strategy and refer to Pontesbury and neighbouring Minsterley as towns. Local government The village is the seat of an extensive civil parish, with its own parish council grouped into five wards, representing the village and outlying areas such as the villages and hamlets of Pontesford, Plealey, Asterley, Cruckton, Cruckmeole, Arscott, Lea Cross, Malehurst etc., as well as Habberley (which was previously a civil parish in its own right until 1967).Pontesbury Parish Boundary Map (also on front cover). It hosts an official Pontesbury Parish website. It is represented on the unitary Shropshire Council and in parliament in the Shrewsbury and Atcham constituency. Housing development Several housing developments are reshaping the village, with 86 new homes named Cricketer's Meadow, being added at Hall Bank, and 25 homes named Young's Piece, being built on the site of a former lead smelting area on Minsterley Road.

There is also a primary school, on whose premises also meet a pre-school playgroup formed 1990. There is also a nursery school, for children aged 3 months to 4 years, called The Ark, on Hall Bank. Other public amenities and services Pontesbury is one of the largest villages in Shropshire and so is host to a wide range of local services including independent local shops selling local produce and three public houses ('The Horseshoes', 'The Nag's Head' and 'The Plough') The village also contains a medical practice, dental surgery, post office, police station (under F Division, West Mercia Police), public library, public hall and cemetery. Industries and trade The village has a long mining history, once linked to Snailbeach and Hanwood via the Minsterley branch line and the Snailbeach District Railways, it supplied local industry with coal, lead, iron and stone. Although the railway tracks are no longer there, the route that it took can still be walked, where some stations and sidings remain. Nearby Poles Coppice, around half-a-mile south of the village, contains two former quarries and is now a countryside recreation area. Churches St. George's Church, Pontesbury. In the centre of the village sits St George's Church of England parish church, the origins of which can be traced to about 1250 AD but due to the site's circular graveyard shape may indicate a much more ancient site of Anglo Saxon or even Celtic origin. The church itself however was largely restored in the 19th century, following the collapse of the mediaeval tower between 1820 and 1825. The churchyard contains the outdoor parish war memorial. The present Portland stone cross, erected 1963, replaced an earlier elaborate cross by Temple Lushington Moore and unveiled in 1921, which bore a crucifix and images of the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and St George and the Dragon but had become dilapidated and was dismantled in 1960. There are also active Baptist, Methodist and Congregationalist Churches.

Source: (accessed: Friday May 7, 2010), p.45 Vedanta According to Dvaita of Madhvacharya and Vishistadvaita of Ramanujacharya, Brahman is conceived as Saguna Brahman (personal deity) or ishvara (Lord of the universe) with infinite attributes, including form. However, by contrast with Dvaita, Vishistadvaita use of term Brahman secondarily denoted the world that depends on Brahman, namely all minds and material things constituting Brahman's body. Saguna Brahman is immortal, imperishable, eternal, as clearly stated in the Bhagavad Gita. The personal form indicated is generally Adi Narayana, or Krishna. While the Advaita of Adi Shankara retained both Saguna Brahman (Brahman with qualities) and Nirguna Brahman (Brahman without qualities), but he considered former to be merely illusory. While on the basis of an esoteric enlightened experience (moksha) and scripture (sruti), he holds that only Nirguna Brahman is real. While Dvaita of Madhva and Vishistadvaita of Ramanuja considers Saguna Brahman as the ultimate reality and liberation (moksha) is attained only by the grace of God. Other Surya is regarded as Saguna Brahman by Saura (Hinduism), Goddess Shakti (or Parvati, Durga, Kali, Mahalakshmi, or Gayatri) is seen as the Saguna Brahman in Shaktism and Shiva is the Saguna Brahman of Shaivism.

Chronologically it is the first story about Mowgli although it was written after \\"In the Rukh\\" in which Mowgli appears as an adult. The story first appeared in the January 1894 issue of St. Nicholas Magazine and was collected as the first story in The Jungle Book later in 1894 where it is accompanied by the poem \\"Hunting Song of the Seeonee Pack\\". The story also appears in All the Mowgli Stories. In 1992 it was published as a separate volume with woodcut illustrations by Christopher Wormell. The text is available on-line from several sources as part of The Jungle Book. The story was adapted as a 25-minute animated television cartoon by Chuck Jones in 1976. Jones also directed adaptations of \\"Rikki-Tikki-Tavi\\" and \\"The White Seal\\". Plot summary Father Wolf (Rama) and Mother Wolf (Raksha), a pair of wolves raising a family of cubs, are furious to learn from Tabaqui the jackal that Shere Khan the lame tiger is hunting in their territory because he might kill men and bring human retribution upon the jungle. But when Father Wolf (Rama) hears something approaching their den, it turns out to be not the tiger, but a naked human baby. Mother Wolf (Raksha) decides to adopt the hairless \\"man-cub\\". Her determination is only strengthened by the arrival of Shere Khan, who demands the cub for his meal. The wolves drive off the tiger, and Raksha names him Mowgli the Frog because of his hairlessness. At the wolf pack's meeting at Council Rock, Baloo the bear speaks for the man-cub, and Bagheera the black panther buys his life with a freshly killed bull. Baloo and Bagheera undertake the task of educating Mowgli as he grows. Meanwhile, Shere Khan plans to take revenge on the wolf pack by persuading the younger wolves to depose their leader Akela. When Mowgli is about 11 years old, Bagheera tells him of Shere Khan's plan. Mowgli, being human, is the only creature in the jungle that does not fear fire, so he steals a pot of burning coals from a nearby village in order to use it against Shere Khan. The young wolves prevent Akela from catching his prey, and at that night's meeting, Shere Khan demands that Akela be killed and the man-cub given to him. Mowgli, despite being naked and unprotected, relentlessly attacks Shere Khan with a burning branch and drives him and his allies away, but realises to his sorrow that he must now leave the pack and return to humanity. As he leaves, he vows to return one day and lay Shere Khan's hide upon the Council Rock. Animated special In 1976 Mowgli's Brothers was adapted and directed as a half-hour television animated special of the same name by veteran animator Chuck Jones, with narration and voices by Roddy McDowall, and June Foray as Mother Wolf. Though largely a faithful adaptation of the story, there are some notable changes in Jones's version.

He was known for his break-through 2001 novel Clara Callan, which won three major literary awards in Canada: The Giller Prize, the Trillium Book Award, and the Governor General's Award. Early life and education Wright was born in Midland, Ontario, to Laverne and Laura (n√©e Thomas). Wright graduated from Midland high school in 1956, and attended and graduated from Ryerson Polytechnic Institute in the area of Radio and TV arts in 1959. He worked briefly within local newspapers and radio stations as a copywriter before becoming an assistant editor for Macmillan Canada in 1960.  Career  = Debut and success = Wright married Phyllis Wright (n√©e Cotton) in 1966 and they have two sons, Christopher Stephen and Richard Andrew. During Wright's time at Macmillan, he published his first book, a children's book entitled Andrew Tolliver (later retitled One John A. Too Many). Wright's first full-length novel, The Weekend Man, was written in eighteen months while staying at his wife's family cottage in Quebec. The novel became a critical success, winning praise for Wright's versatility and ability to create believable female characters. In 1970, Wright returned to postsecondary at Trent University, graduating in 1972 with a B.A. in English. In 1976, Wright obtained a position at Ridley College, a private school, teaching English until his retirement. = Later career = Although nominated for several literary awards, Wright didn't gain recognition until 2001 when his novel Clara Callan won both the Giller Prize and Governor-General's Award. This led to the republication of many of his earlier works. This novel went on to win three of Canada's major literary awards: The Giller Prize, the Trillium Book Award, and the Governor General's Award. Wright's published works deal with the lives of ordinary people, with a profound balance of depth and sensitivity. Wright had been praised as an author who created believable characters with a voice that must be heard. The reviewer in The Montreal Gazette is just one of many who have praised Wright's work, stating that his most recent book, Mr.Shakespeare's Bastard, is \\"A masterful novel ‚Ä¶ [which] confirms his ability to evoke an authentically female sensibility.\\" The novel has continued to gain recognition and was described by The Winnipeg Free Press as a novel that \\"Draws us swiftly through the pages...\\" Wright provides a narrative of pure life to his settings and character backgrounds that have continued to give him wide recognition as a Canadian novelist. His novels have been, and continue to be, published all around the world. In 2006, Wright received an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Trent University, and in 2007 he became a member of the Order of Canada.  Later life and death  He lived in St. Catharines, Ontario, where he wrote full-time and enjoyed the recreational pastimes of walking, reading and music. Wright died in hospital on the morning of February 7, 2017 as a result of a stroke. He was 79.

He is a fictional rat who appeared on The Muppet Show and numerous films, with a starring role in the 1992 film The Muppet Christmas Carol. The character is particularly associated with Gonzo the Great, with the two sharing a double act since 1992. Whitmire based the character on Ratso Rizzo in Midnight Cowboy and performed him until 2016. Character Rizzo is a streetwise and sarcastic rat with a New Jersey accent. He is a self-proclaimed acrophobe. His humor can be risque, as in the TV series The Muppets he was given the line, \\"Is ABC going to be OK with 'Mother Teresa on a stick'?\\" To avoid potential difficulty with real-life censors, alternative lines were filmed. Rizzo's family has been mentioned in Muppet media. He has 1,274 brothers and sisters, as told to Gonzo in The Muppet Christmas Carol. In 2016, Disney announced Rizzo came from a family that traditionally cooked pizzas. This addition to his story was in light of a new pizzeria at Disney's Hollywood Studios dedicated to Rizzo, called PizzeRizzo. History Steve Whitmire was Rizzo's creator and original performer. Rizzo's name is derived from Dustin Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo character in Midnight Cowboy. Steve Whitmire created the character, based on rats he had previously made out of bottles. Rizzo first appeared in episode 418 of The Muppet Show, as one of many rats following Christopher Reeve backstage. He can be seen mugging and reacting to practically every line of dialogue. He remained a scene-stealing background figure through the final season, occasionally performing with Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem. By the time of The Muppets Christmas Carol, Whitmire had been performing Rizzo for around 12 years. After the series, he appeared in The Great Muppet Caper as a bellboy in a fleabag London hotel. He has appeared in most later Muppet projects, including The Muppets Take Manhattan and Muppets Tonight. In The Muppet Christmas Carol, he developed a double act with Gonzo, with director Brian Henson and the crew envisioning Rizzo as \\"pain-in- the-neck sidekick.\\" The characters narrate, break the fourth wall, and Rizzo challenges Gonzo's claims to be Charles Dickens. The Gonzo and Rizzo partnership was continued in Muppet Treasure Island, with Rizzo again offering a humorous critique of the handling of the story, and in Muppets from Space. Along with Kermit and Gonzo, Rizzo gave an audio commentary for the Muppets from Space DVD. Rizzo appears as a background character in the 2011 film The Muppets, without a spoken dialogue, although he is seen singing along during the finale, as well as the scene in which Kermit the Frog addresses a large crowd of Muppets. In Muppets Most Wanted (2014), and the short feature Rizzo's Biggest Fan on the Blu-ray release, the character calls for more screentime. Rizzo returned to prominence in the TV series The Muppets, where he was on a writing crew with Gonzo and Pepe the King Prawn. In 2017, it was announced Whitmire departed from the Muppets franchise, including the part of Rizzo, after being dismissed from the part of Kermit the Frog in October 2016. Disney did not immediately announce a new performer for Rizzo, though Matt Vogel was announced for the replacement for Kermit.

The earlier books evoke visions of an outdoor 1940s and '50s childhood reminiscent of Enid Blyton's Famous Five books, in which children are allowed to have adventures, explore strange places and encounter villains without adult supervision. These Lone Pine books were illustrated by Bertram Prance (1889-1958).

At the age of eight, the Mazenod family was forced to flee the French revolution, leaving their considerable wealth behind. As refugees in Italy, they were very poor, and moved from place to place. At the age of twenty, he returned to France and became a priest. Mazenod founded the congregation of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate. Initially focused on rebuilding the Church in France after the Revolution, their work soon spread, particularly to Canada. Mazenod was appointed Bishop of Marseille in 1837, and Archbishop in 1851. He was beatified on 19 October 1975 by Pope Paul VI, and canonized on 3 December 1995 by Pope John Paul II. His feast day is 21 May. Biography =Refugee= Eugene de Mazenod was born on 1 August 1782 and baptized the following day in the √âglise de la Madeleine in Aix-en-Provence. His father, Charles Antoine de Mazenod, was one of the Presidents of the Court of Finances, and his mother was Marie Rose Joannis. Eugene began his schooling at the College Bourbon, but this was interrupted by the events of the French Revolution. With the approach of the French revolutionary forces, the family was forced to flee to Italy.\\"Eugene de Mazenod (1782-1861)\\", Vatican News Service Eugene became a boarder at the College of Nobles in Turin (Piedmont), but a move to Venice meant the end to formal schooling. With their money running out, Eugene's father was forced to seek various employments, none of which were successful. His mother and sister returned to France - eventually seeking a divorce so as to be able to regain their property that had been seized. Eugene was fortunate to be welcomed by the Zinelli family in Venice. One of their sons, the priest Bartolo Zinelli, took special care of Eugene and saw to his education in the well-provided family library where the young adolescent spent many hours each day. Don Bartolo was a major influence in the human, academic and spiritual development of Eugene. Once again the French army chased the √©migr√©s from Venice, forcing Eugene and his father and two uncles to seek refuge in Naples for less than a year, and finally to flee to Palermo in Sicily. Here Eugene was invited to become part of the household of the Duke and Duchess of Cannizaro as a companion to their two sons. Being part of the high society of Sicily became the opportunity for Eugene to rediscover his noble origins and to live a lavish style of life. He took to himself the title of 'Comte' (\\"Count\\") de Mazenod, did all the courtly things, and dreamed of a bright future. =Conversion= At the age of twenty, Eugene returned to France and lived with his mother in Aix en Provence. Initially he enjoyed all the pleasures of Aix as a rich young nobleman, intent on the pursuit of pleasure and money - and a rich girl who would bring a good dowry. Gradually he became aware of how empty his life was,\\"St. Eugene de Mazenod\\", Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate and began to search for meaning in more regular church involvement, reading and personal study, and charitable work among prisoners. His journey came to a climax on Good Friday, 1807 when he was 25 years old. Looking at the sight of the Cross, he had a religious experience. He recounted the spiritual experience in his retreat journal: > Can I forget the bitter tears that the sight of the cross brought streaming > from my eyes one Good Friday? Indeed they welled up from the heart, there > was no checking them, they were too abundant for me to be able to hide them > from those who like myself were assisting at that moving ceremony. I was in > a state of mortal sin and it was precisely this that made me grieve‚Ä¶Blessed, > a thousand times blessed, that he, this good Father, notwithstanding my > unworthiness, lavished on me all the richness of his mercy. =Priest= In 1808, he began his studies for the priesthood at the Saint- Sulpice Seminary in Paris and was ordained a priest at Amiens (Picardy), on 21 December 1811.\\"Saint Eugene de Mazenod\\", Franciscan Media Since Napoleon had expelled the Sulpician priests from the seminary, Eugene stayed on as a formator for a semester. As a member of the Seminary, notwithstanding personal risk, Eugene committed himself to serve and assist Pope Pius VII, who at this time was a prisoner of emperor Napoleon I at Fontainebleau. In this way he experienced at firsthand the suffering of the post-Revolutionary Church. On his return to Aix, Father de Mazenod asked not to be assigned to a parish but to dedicate himself fully to evangelizing those who were not being reached by the structures of the local church: the poor who spoke only the Proven√ßal language, prisoners, youth, the inhabitants of poor villages who were ignorant of their faith. The goal of his priestly preaching and ministry was always to lead others to develop themselves fully as humans, then as Christians and finally to become saints. Founder =Oblates of Mary Immaculate= On 25 January 1816, \\"impelled by a strong impulse from outside of himself\\" he invited other priests to join him in his life of total oblation to God and to the most abandoned of Provence. Initially called \\"Missionaries of Provence,\\" they dedicated themselves to evangelization through preaching parish missions in the poor villages, youth and prison ministry. In 1818 a second community was established at the Marian shrine of Notre Dame du Laus. This became the occasion for the missionaries to become a religious congregation, united through vows and the evangelical counsels. Changing their name to Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, the group received papal approbation on 17 February 1826.Morice, Adrian. \\"Charles Joseph Eugene de Mazenod.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 10. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 30 July 2018 =Foreign Missions= In 1841, Bishop Bourget of Montreal invited the Oblates to Canada. At the same time, there was an outreach to the British Isles. This was the beginning of a history of missionary outreach to the most abandoned peoples in Canada, United States, Mexico, England and Ireland, Algeria, Southern Africa and Ceylon during the founder's lifetime. In 200 years this zeal spread and took root in the establishment of the Oblates in nearly 70 countries. Bishop Mazenod Bishop After having aided for some time his uncle, the aged Bishop of Marseilles, in the administration of his diocese, Father De Mazenod was called to Rome and, on 14 October 1832, consecrated titular Bishop of Icosium, which title in 1837 he exchanged for that of Bishop of Marseilles, a position he held until his death in 1861. During his episcopacy, he commissioned Notre-Dame de la Garde, an ornate Neo-Byzantine basilica on the south side of the old port of Marseille. He favoured the moral teachings of Alphonsus Liguori, whose theological system he was the first to introduce in France, and whose first biography in French he caused to be written by one of the Oblates. He inspired local priest Joseph-Marie Timon- David to found the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Marseille in 1852. In spite of his well-known outspokenness, he was made a Peer of the French Empire, and in 1851 Pope Pius IX gave him the pallium.

He is sometimes called Jodocus Hondius the Elder to distinguish him from his son Jodocus Hondius II. Hondius is best known for his early maps of the New World and Europe, for re-establishing the reputation of the work of Gerard Mercator, and for his portraits of Francis Drake. One of the notable figures in the Golden Age of Dutch/Netherlandish cartography (c. 1570s‚Äì1670s), he helped establish Amsterdam as the center of cartography in Europe in the 17th century.  Biography  Hondius was born in Wakken and grew up in Ghent. In his early years he established himself as an engraver, instrument maker and globe maker. In 1584 he moved to London to escape religious difficulties in Flanders. In 1587 in London he married Colette van den Keere, son of Hendrik, an engraver of metal type, and collaborated with her brother Pieter, also a mapmaker and engraver. Hondius map of the bay of New Albion on the Pacific coast of America While in England, Hondius was instrumental in publicizing the work of Francis Drake, who had made a circumnavigation of the world in the late 1570s. In particular, in 1589 Hondius produced a now famous map of the bay of New Albion, where Drake briefly established a settlement on the west coast of North America. Hondius's map was based on journal and eyewitness accounts of the trip and has long fuelled speculation about the precise location of Drake's landing, now thought to be at Drakes Estero in California. Hondius is also thought to be the artist of several well-known portraits of Drake that are now in the National Portrait Gallery in London. Hondius's (or his predecessors') use of multiple sources can be illustrated by this map of Asia, which shows Beijing three times: twice as Khanbaliq (Combalich in the land of \\"Kitaisk\\" on the Ob River, and Cambalu, in \\"Cataia\\") and once as Paquin (Beijing), in the prefecture of Xuntien (Shuntian) In 1593 he moved to Amsterdam, where he remained until the end of his life. In co-operation with the Amsterdam publisher Cornelis Claesz. in 1604 he purchased the plates of Gerard Mercator's Atlas from Mercator's grandson. Mercator's work had languished in comparison to the rival Theatrum Orbis Terrarum by Ortelius. Hondius republished Mercator's work with 36 additional maps, including several which he himself had produced. Despite the addition of his own contributions, Hondius gave Mercator full credit as the author of the work, listing himself as the publisher. Hondius's new edition of Mercator's work was a great success, selling out after a year. Hondius later published a second edition, as well as a pocket version Atlas Minor. The maps have since become known as the \\"Mercator/Hondius series\\". Hondius was a cousin of Abraham Goos, and he taught Goos mapmaking and engraving. In the French edition of the Atlas Minor we find one of the first instances of a thematic map using map symbols. This is a map entitled Designatio orbis christiani (1607) showing the dispersion of major religions. Between 1605 and 1610 he was employed by John Speed to engrave the plates for Speed's The Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine. Leo Belgicus (1611). Hondius died, aged 48, in Amsterdam. After his death, his publishing work in Amsterdam was continued by his widow, two sons, Jodocus II and Henricus, and son-in-law Johannes Janssonius, whose name appears on the Atlas as co-publisher after 1633. Eventually, starting with the first 1606 edition in Latin, about 50 editions of the Atlas were released in the main European languages. In the Islamic world, the atlas was partially translated by the Turkish scholar K√¢tip √áelebi. The series is sometimes called the \\"Mercator/Hondius/Janssonius\\" series because of Janssonius's later contributions. Links with Richard Norwood Mappa Aestivarum Insularum, alias Barmudas dictarum ... (c. 1633). Hondius's Mappa Aestivarum Insularum, alias Barmudas dictarum ... (Amsterdam c. 1633) is a famous map of Bermuda. The 'Sea Venture' under Sir George Somers was wrecked off Bermuda in 1609 and the surviving Englishmen divided the island into Tribes (later Parishes) and Shares, which are individually listed with their owners at the foot of the map. Shortly afterwards the Bermudas were granted to the Virginia Company, hence various references to the company on the map including the distance to the Roanoke Colony in Virginia. The miniature map with its own scale, top left, shows the island's position relative to the Virginian coast. Hondius derived his map from Richard Norwood's survey which was carried out in 1622 and published by John Speed in 1627. Unlike this entry, which has Hondius working from survey material ten years after he died, it remains one of the most accurate and decorative maps of the period. Portrayal of Globes in Vermeer's The Astronomer and The Geographer Scholars have argued that the globes depicted in celebrated 17th-century painter Johannes Vermeer's 1668 The Astronomer and 1669 The Geographer were based on a pair of globes by Hondius. Close inspection of these two globes reveals striking similarities to a pair of globes made in 1618 by Hondius. The globes were made as pendants, one depicting the earth while the other depicted the constellations. In Vermeer's The Astronomer the scholar consults a version of Hondius' celestial globe and in The Geographer Hondius' terrestrial globe can be seen placed atop the back cabinet. A version of Hondius' celestial globe can be found in the Scheepvaartmuseum in Amsterdam and the terrestrial globe can be found in The Hispanic Society Museum & Library in New York City.

Fuchs Controversy notwithstanding, The Last Place on Earth had a tremendous impact on public interest in Polar matters; Fiennes considers that the extent of the attention the book received has meant that \\"a number of subsequent Scott biographies refer constantly to Scott and Amundsen, or praise Huntford's scholarship.\\"Race To The Pole: Tragedy, Heroism, and Scott's Antarctic Quest, Ranulph Fiennes, Hyperion, 2004, p. 385 In a review of Fiennes's Captain Scott (subsequently published as Race to the Pole) in The Spectator, Simon Courtauld referred to Huntford's biography as a \\"devastating demolition job ‚Äî Scott bad, Amundsen good\\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2003/11/dogged-by-ill-fortune In the Polar Record, Karen May and George Lewis, in an assessment of Huntford's biography, concluded that \\"Huntford's interpretation of events shows a serious misunderstanding of the primary sources and historical context.\\"Polar Record, vol. 50, issue 2, April 2014, Cambridge University Press, pp. 156-164, \\"'A kind of suicide'? Errors and misconceptions in Roland Huntford's account of the last days of Scott's polar party\\" Huntford put forth the point of view that Roald Amundsen's success in reaching the South Pole was abetted by much superior planning, whereas errors by Scott (notably including the reliance on horses instead of sled dogs) ultimately resulted in the death of Scott and his companions. Huntford's other books include Sea of Darkness, The Sayings of Henrik Ibsen and Two Planks and a Passion: The dramatic history of skiing. His polemical The New Totalitarians is a critique of socialism in Sweden, written from the point of view of western political culture. His main thesis was that the Swedish social democratic party, like the \\"new totalitarians\\" in Aldous Huxley‚Äôs Brave New World, relied less upon the violence and intimidation of the old totalitarians than upon sly persuasion and soft manipulation in order to achieve its goals.

The name derives from the Spanish word burroquito (little donkey), the character's costume being constructed so as to give the illusion of a dancer riding a small burro or donkey. This masquerade was brought to Trinidad by Venezuelan settlers. The burrokeet costume is a well-decorated donkey's head made from coloured paper and attached to a bamboo frame. The masquerader enters through a hole at the back of the \\"donkey\\"'s neck and carries the reins in his hands, with the animal's body fitted around his hips, thereby creating the illusion of being the donkey's rider. The donkey's body is covered in a long satin skirt and has a sisal rope tail, sometimes decorated with flowers. The bit and bridle are made of coloured cord. The \\"rider\\" wears a satin shirt and a large matador straw hat and dances in a way that mimics the antics of a donkey, making it caper and bow.

He is one of the most successful managers of Tottenham Hotspur, winning 3 major trophies for the club as manager there. Playing career Burkinshaw was born in Higham, Barnsley, West Riding of Yorkshire, and began his footballing career with Midland League side Denaby United while working at Dodworth Colliery. He had a brief spell as an amateur with Wolverhampton Wanderers before joining Liverpool in November 1953. He played just once for Liverpool, against Port Vale in April 1955, moving to Workington in December 1957 for a fee of ¬£3,000. He was player-manager of Workington between November 1964 and March 1965, leaving to join Scunthorpe United in May 1965, having played 293 league games for Workington. He played a further 108 league games for Scunthorpe, and had a short spell as caretaker manager before retiring from playing in May 1968. Coaching and managerial career Shortly after announcing his retirement, Burkinshaw moved to Zambia where he coached for a few months before returning to England as coach of Newcastle United. He was sacked by Newcastle in May 1975 and joined Tottenham Hotspur as coach the same month. He became manager of Tottenham Hotspur Football club after Terry Neill left as manager for Arsenal in 1976. He was manager from 14 July 1976 to 31 May 1984, and he won more major football competitions at the club than all but one other Spurs manager (that being Bill Nicholson). Spurs were relegated in Burkinshaw's first year in charge but bounced straight back for promotion the following year. He signed two Argentine World Cup stars, Osvaldo Ardiles and Ricardo Villa, in 1978. It was considered a brave move but Ardiles would become one of the Spurs greats and Villa would score one of the greatest goals ever seen at Wembley in the 1981 FA Cup Final replay. Burkinshaw's Spurs, with Ardiles, Villa and Glenn Hoddle, won two successive FA Cups (81 & 82). In his final game in charge, Spurs won the UEFA Cup (1984) for a second time after a penalty shoot-out after the second leg at White Hart Lane. In doing so, they beat an Anderlecht team that included the future Spurs Sporting Director Frank Arnesen. On leaving White Hart Lane for the last time, brought about by a disagreement with the board, he was said to have remarked: \\"There used to be a football club over there\\" (actually a misattribution ‚Äì it was written by journalist Ken Jones who mentioned to Burkinshaw as he was leaving the club the Frank Sinatra's song \\"There Used to Be a Ballpark\\", said to be about the demolition of Ebbets Field, and Burkinshaw nodded in agreement.) In June 1984 he was appointed as coach to the Bahrain national side. He left that role in July 1986. Burkinshaw later managed Sporting Clube de Portugal until he was sacked in February 1988. In October 1988 he returned to England as manager of Gillingham, but resigned in April 1989 with the team on the verge of relegation to Division Four. Burkinshaw took charge of big-spending Malaysian state team Pahang between late April and July 1991, leading them to the top of the league table before departing for Swindon Town. Burkinshaw was later Chief Scout for Glenn Hoddle and Ossie Ardiles at Swindon Town and in May 1992 became assistant to Ardiles at West Bromwich Albion. When Ardiles moved to manage Tottenham in the summer of 1993, Burkinshaw was promoted to Albion manager. However, his career as Albion manager lasted just one season (1993‚Äì94) and he was sacked after they narrowly avoided relegation back to Division Two. He was later Director of Football at Aberdeen before briefly taking charge as caretaker-manager at Pittodrie when Roy Aitken was sacked in 1997, he left when Alex Miller was appointed as the club's new manager. In March 2005 Burkinshaw was appointed assistant manager at Watford. He left this position in December 2007 due to a serious family illness, having helped the club reach promotion to the Premier League in 2006.

The line was taken over by the War Department in 1941, and extensively reconstructed to serve Central Ammunition Depot Nesscliffe. It was finally closed in 1960. History It opened in 1911, running the reconstructed Potteries, Shrewsbury and North Wales Railway which continued to be owned by the Shropshire Railways Company, and was one of the Colonel Stephens Railways. It lost its passenger services in 1933, although some limited bank holiday services for tourists continued until 1937. Operations The terminus of the line was at Shrewsbury Abbey station not at Shrewsbury railway station. This was because the joint operators, Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) refused to let the smaller company have access to mainline services. After the main railway closed Shrewsbury Abbey was retained as an oil depot siding connected to a stub of the Severn Valley branch. The site finally closed in 1988. A new road in the area has been named \\"Old Potts Way\\" as a reminder of what was known as the Potts Railway. A number of the stations shown in the diagram were added after the closure of the original Potteries, Shrewsbury & North Wales Railway. CAD Nesscliffe Central Ammunition Depot Nesscliffe was developed by the War Office/Ministry of Defence during World War II as an ammunition dump. To service the extensive property, the MoD took over the virtually defunct S&MR; from 1941, and built extensive additional service tracks along the of railway line from Maesbrook to the former Ford and Crossgate railway station, south of the River Severn. Like a typical ammunition depot, the site was laid out over an extensive area to avoid total destruction should an accidental explosion occur, or the site be attacked by enemy. The site was made up of four sub-sites: Kinnerley; Pentre; Ford; and Argoed. The four sites were capable of storing around of shells. There was also a sub-site at Loton Park, under the Alberbury medieval deer park, used for storage of both incendiary ammunition and chemical weapons shells from 1943. This was one of two CW depots operated in co-operation with and guarded by the United States Army Air Forces, the second being in Shepton Mallet, Somerset. Locomotives and train drivers were provided by the Royal Engineers, who also maintained the extensive network. Their main servicing depot for rolling stock was on the stub-junction of the former branchline to Criggion. Closure Ammunition storage officially stopped in 1959 on site, and the ammunition depot closed in 1961, when the railway tracks were removed. Operational locomotives were moved to the Longmoor Military Railway, and the non-operational ones were sold. Since this time, the of flat pastureland have formed the British Army's Nesscliffe Training Area, capable of accommodating up to 530 personnel.

From 1945, the Criggion branch was operated by a Sentinel steam locomotive (works no. 7026) owned by the British Quarrying Company. Two of the war department locomotives were LNER J15 Class nos 7541 and 7835 (renumbered WD221 and WD212) which had been withdrawn by the LNER and sold to London Film Productions for their 1936 film Knight Without Armour. The two locomotives were moved to Denham film studios and modified to look more Russian as that was where the film was set. The locomotives were then sold to the War Department and worked on the Shropshire and Montgomeryshire Railway. During their war service both were involved in incidents and returned to Stratford in 1944 where they were subsequently scrapped.

The cobra image of Wadjet with the vulture image of Nekhbet representing of the unification of Lower and Upper Egypt The Uraeus (; plural Uraei or Uraeuses; from the Greek , oura√Æos, \\"on its tail\\"; from Egyptian ' ('), \\"rearing cobra\\") is the stylized, upright form of an Egyptian cobra, used as a symbol of sovereignty, royalty, deity and divine authority in ancient Egypt. Symbolism Four golden uraei cobra figures, bearing sun disks on their heads, on the reverse side of the throne of Pharaoh Tutankhamun (1346‚Äì1337 BC). Valley of the Kings, Thebes, New Kingdom (18th Dynasty) The Uraeus is a symbol for the goddess Wadjet.Egyptian-Gods She was one of the earliest Egyptian deities and was often depicted as a cobra, as she is the serpent goddess. The center of her cult was in Per-Wadjet, later called Buto by the Greeks.Herodotus, Historia, B:152; 155; 156 She became the patroness of the Nile Delta and the protector of all of Lower Egypt.Dunand and Zivie-Coche The pharaohs wore the uraeus as a head ornament: either with the body of Wadjet atop the head, or as a crown encircling the head; this indicated Wadjet's protection and reinforced the pharaoh's claim over the land. In whatever manner that the Uraeus was displayed upon the pharaoh's head, it was, in effect, part of the pharaoh's crown. The pharaoh was recognized only by wearing the Uraeus, which conveyed legitimacy to the ruler. There is evidence for this tradition even in the Old Kingdom during the third millennium BCE.National Public Library Several goddesses associated with or being considered aspects of Wadjet are depicted wearing the uraeus as well. At the time of the unification of Egypt, the image of Nekhbet, the goddess who was represented as a white vulture and held the same position as the patron of Upper Egypt, joined the image of Wadjet on the Uraeus that would encircle the crown of the pharaohs who ruled the unified Egypt. The importance of their separate cults kept them from becoming merged as with so many Egyptian deities. Together, they were known as the Nebty or the Two Ladies, who became the joint protectors and patrons of the unified Egypt. Later, the pharaohs were seen as a manifestation of the sun god Ra, and so it also was believed that the Uraeus protected them by spitting fire on their enemies from the fiery eye of the goddess. In some mythological works, the eyes of Ra are said to be uraei. Wadjets existed long before the rise of this cult when they originated as the eye of Wadjet as a cobra. Wadjets are also the name of the symbols called the Eye of the Moon, Eye of Hathor, the Eye of Horus, and the Eye of Ra‚Äîdepending upon the dates of the references to the symbols. As the Uraeus was seen as a royal symbol, the deities Horus and Set were also depicted wearing the symbol on their crowns. In early ancient Egyptian mythology, Horus would have been the name given to any king as part of the many titles taken, being identified as the son of the goddess Isis. According to the later mythology of Re, the first Uraeus was said to have been created by the goddess Isis, who formed it from the dust of the earth and the spittle of the then-current sun deity. In this version of the mythology, the Uraeus was the instrument with which Isis gained the throne of Egypt for Osiris. Isis is associated with and may be considered an aspect of Wadjet. Uraeus with the Red Crown of Lower Egypt. Late Period of Egypt, 664‚Äì332 BC Golden Uraeus of Senusret II In 1919, after only a half-hour of excavation, the Qufti worker Hosni Ibrahim held in his hands the solid-gold Golden Uraeus of Senusret II. It had been decided to make a (follow-up) \\"complete clearance\\" of the El-Lahun Pyramid's rooms at Saqqara. The start in the rock-cut offering chamber, leading from the tomb, on the south, immediately revealed in the turnover of the six inches of debris, the Golden Uraeus crown ornament. Prior to the 1922 find of Tutankhamun's tomb, this Golden Uraeus was the only ornament ever known to be worn by an entombed pharaoh, and it was thought that it was passed to the next pharaoh. The Golden Uraeus is of solid gold, , black eyes of granite, a snake head of deep ultramarine lapis lazuli, the flared cobra hood of dark carnelian inlays, and inlays of turquoise. For mounting on the pharaoh's crown, two loops in the rear-supporting tail of the cobra provide the attachment points.Reeves (1920) pg. 157.Hagen, pg. 202. As a hieroglyph Green glazed cobra amulet in the form of a Uraeus Besides the Uraeus being used as an ornament for statuary or as an adornment on the pharaoh, it also was used for jewellery and in amulets. However, another important use is as the hieroglyph. For Uraeus ornament as a mummy grave example, See: Djedptahiufankh, High Priest of 21st Dynasty, Shoshenq I. The simplest hieroglyph is the \\"Cobra\\" (the Uraeus); however there are subcategories, referring to: a goddess, a priestess, the goddess Menhit, the shrine of the goddess (√†ter), the goddess Isis, and lastly goddess: (Cobra (Uraeus) at base of deity (ntr)). The Rosetta Stone uses the plural of the last example, \\"3 √ó \\"god flag\\" with Cobra at each base of flag\\". The story of the Rosetta Stone has the king (the priests of the king) listing his reasons for being honored, and in return, \\"The Gods and Goddesses (plural)\\" reward him. The last two-thirds of the Rosetta Stone relates how he will be honored, including erecting the Rosetta Stone, for all to read. Another example of the hieroglyph usage is as adornments upon the hieroglyph for \\"shrine\\", and also for \\"buildings\\".Budge The Blue Crown Before the New Kingdom Period, the body of the Uraeus coiled in around in circles behind its raised head on the Blue Crown. The king is most often depicted wearing the Blue Crown in combat and the aftermath of combat scenes. Additionally, the smaller scale king usually wore the Blue Crown when depicted in a protective group of deities. Colossal statues of the king wearing a Blue Crown are extremely rare; the typical royal statue also does not feature a Blue Crown. Also, depictions of the Blue Crown with its Uraeus does not decorate royal tombs until late in the Ramesside Period. The deity-on-earth king was thought to require extra protection in his mortal form, emphasizing the protective qualities of the Uraeus. Hardwick The Uraeus was usually crafted from precious metals, most commonly gold and less frequently silver, and adorned with gemstones. Alchin Seraphim The angelic seraphim, found in the Hebrew Bible and later Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions, are frequently associated with serpents and are thought to have derived from the concept of uraeus.

South Hampton Roads Hampton Roads is the common name for the metropolitan area that surrounds the body of water of the same name. The land portion of Hampton Roads has been historically divided into two regions, South Hampton Roads on the south side and the Virginia Peninsula on the north side. (Locally, South Hampton Roads is commonly called \\"the Southside\\", which is not to be confused with \\"Southside Virginia\\", which is a separate region of the south-central portion of Virginia located farther inland.) As of the 2010 Census, the Hampton Roads MSA is the fifth largest metropolitan area by size in the southeastern United States, and is the second-largest (after the Charlotte metro area) between Washington, D.C. and Atlanta, Georgia. U.S. military installations USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) arriving at Naval Station Norfolk South Hampton Roads is home to several United States military bases. =City of Portsmouth= Norfolk Naval Shipyard is located in Portsmouth, as are the Naval Medical Center, Portsmouth, two historic and important facilities, as well as several smaller facilities. The shipyard was founded as the Gosport Shipyard on November 1, 1767, and has the country's first dry dock. The name was changed after the American Civil War. (Although it is located in Portsmouth, the name Norfolk was chosen to avoid confusion with another U.S. Navy shipyard at Portsmouth, New Hampshire which is about 50 miles (80 km) north of Boston, Massachusetts, at the southernmost tip of Maine.) =City of Norfolk= Across the Elizabeth River, at Sewell's Point near the mouth of Hampton Roads is the Norfolk Navy Base, the central hub of the United States Navy's Atlantic Fleet. The base was founded in 1917, and is now the largest naval facility in the world. =City of Virginia Beach= Virginia Beach is home to the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Station Oceana (NAS Oceana) and Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek (NAB Little Creek). NAS Oceana is the largest employer in Virginia Beach, and both bases there, like the Norfolk Navy Base, are considered to be the largest of their respective kinds in the world. Furthermore, adjacent to Oceana is NAVSEA Dam Neck. Virginia Beach is also the home of Joint Expeditionary Base East, operated by the United States Navy, which is located at Cape Henry. =City of Chesapeake= St. Julien's Creek Annex is a U.S. Navy facility in Chesapeake on the Southern Branch Elizabeth River. It began operations in 1849 and occupies approximately , including of land, of marsh, and of surface water. It is currently considered part of the Norfolk Navy Base. Chesapeake is also home to U.S. Naval Auxiliary Landing Field Fentress, an auxiliary landing facility for NAS Oceana. The decision to call the region \\"Hampton Roads\\" was a political one. The area was referred to as \\"Tidewater\\" for many years by the local residents. The local baseball team was called the Tidewater Tides for years but is now called the Norfolk Tides. When they first came to Tidewater, they adopted the local name to draw more fans. Local government In Colonial times, and even in the first 150 years of the United States, much like Virginia as a whole, South Hampton Roads was in an almost constant state of change in terms of local government, largely due to growth, as counties were divided and towns were formed as the population grew. Some towns grew to become cities. Under the state constitutional changes in 1871, extant and future cities in Virginia became independent cities of the counties they had formerly been located within. However, in the second half of the 20th century, an unprecedented wave of city-county-town local government consolidations took place in South Hampton Roads and on the Virginia Peninsula. Nowhere else in Virginia have rural areas and more dense cities been combined in such a manner as these two areas. The changes resulted in the area having Virginia's cities with the largest land areas and the most farming, even over 30 years after the consolidations in some instances. =Current cities, counties and towns= The South Hampton Roads region includes five independent cities, three counties, and five incorporated towns with a total population of 1,191,937 people. There were also a number of political subdivisions which are now extinct, primarily due to growth and consolidation of local government (see section below). =Independent cities= *Chesapeake (formerly Norfolk County) *Norfolk *Portsmouth *Suffolk (formerly Nansemond County) *Virginia Beach (formerly Princess Anne County) =Counties= *Currituck County, NC *Gates County, NC *Isle of Wight County =Incorporated towns= *Isle of Wight County *Town of Smithfield *Town of Windsor =Extinct political subdivisions= Exclusive of towns which became cities and still have the same name, no less than 2 shires, 6 counties, 1 town, and 2 entire cities no longer exist in the South Hampton Roads area. For search of genealogical, land, and other historical records, it may be necessary to find these old names. The following is a listing of these 11 extinct shire, counties, towns, and cities, with the approximate dates they existed: *Elizabeth River Shire (1634‚Äì1636) *Warrosquyoake Shire (1634‚Äì1637) *New Norfolk County (1636‚Äì1637) *Upper Norfolk County (1637‚Äì1646) *Lower Norfolk County (1637‚Äì1691) *Nansemond County (1646-1972) *Norfolk County (1691‚Äì1963) *Princess Anne County (1691‚Äì1963) *Town of Berkley (unknown-1906) *South Norfolk (1919‚Äì1963) *City of Nansemond (1972‚Äì1974) Highways, bridges, tunnels, bridge-tunnels Generally surrounded by water, the South Hampton Roads region is accessed from the north by a network of highways, bridges, tunnels and bridge-tunnels across the James and Elizabeth Rivers, the harbor of Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Bay. The area is bordered on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the State of North Carolina, and on the west by several counties which are considered to be in the Southside Virginia region. =Major bridges, tunnels, and bridge-tunnels= *Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel *Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel *James River Bridge *Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel *Berkley Bridge *Downtown Tunnel *Midtown Tunnel *Gilmerton Bridge *High Rise Bridge *Jordan Bridge *Steel Bridge =Interstate highways and other freeways= *Interstate 64 *Interstate 264 *Interstate 464 *Interstate 564 *Interstate 664 *Hampton Roads Beltway *Virginia Beach Expressway *Chesapeake Expressway =U.S. Highways and major state highways= *U.S. Route 13 *U.S. Route 17 *U.S. Route 58 *U.S. Route 60 *U.S. Route 258 *U.S. Route 460 *State Route 10 *State Route 31 *State Route 32 *State Route 143 *State Route 164 *State Route 168 *State Route 337 See also *Battle of Hampton Roads *Jamestown Exposition *Sewell's Point *Willoughby Spit *Ocean View *Lambert's Point *Bower's Hill *Craney Island *Military Highway Category:Geography of Virginia Category:Hampton Roads ","title":"South Hampton Roads"},{"id":"1155289","text":"Estes is an English-language surname said to derive from Old English and have the meaning \\"of the East\\" (literally, \\"East's\\").

It is housed on the campus of the former Ellwood P. Cubberley High School. Space is available for rent by the hour, either one-time or on a regular basis for community related meetings, seminars, social events, dances, theatre performances, music rehearsals and athletic events.  History  The Ellwood P. Cubberley High School opened in the Fall of 1956 and closed in 1979, as a result of budget cuts from California Proposition 13 (1978). Cubberley High School is perhaps best known as the setting of Ron Jones' 1967 social experiment The Third Wave, helping to teach Fascism. The high school was named after Ellwood P. Cubberley, an influential authority in the development of institutionalized education. The 35 acre property belongs to the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD), and is leased to the City of Palo Alto. The larger remainder of this site, (approx. 39,000 square feet) was leased since 2002 to the Foothill-De Anza College District for the Middlefield Campus of Foothill College, a local community college. However, in 2016 this campus moved to Sunnyvale and with the loss of Foothill College as a tenent, this opened up more rentable space for other community-based organizations. The site boasts a track, a grassy school \\"amphitheater,\\" and a gym, now used as sites for public running, recreation, and community athletics respectively. Cubberley Community Center has been home to local interest organizations including; a ballroom dancing club, child care services, senior center, wildlife rescue organization, Palo Alto Vineyard Church, a Chinese reading room, kung fu classes, karate lessons, private artist studios, L‚ÄôEcole de Danse, the Palo Alto Chamber Orchestra and many more. The Friends of the Palo Alto Library holds used book sales at Cubberley on the second Saturday of every month and the following Sunday, at three locations on campus. The Cubberley Community Center once hosted rock shows by local bands and touring artists including Buffalo Springfield, Santana, William Penn and His Pals, Cake, Third Eye Blind, blink-182, Daniel Tsai Band, and Frank Black.

Sister cities or twin towns are a form of legal or social agreement between towns, cities, counties, oblasts, prefectures, provinces, regions, states, and even countries in geographically and politically distinct areas to promote cultural and commercial ties. The modern concept of town twinning, conceived after the Second World War in 1947, was intended to foster friendship and understanding among different cultures and between former foes as an act of peace and reconciliation, and to encourage trade and tourism. By the 2000s, town twinning became increasingly used to form strategic international business links among member cities.  Terminology  An example of a twinning agreement between Castellabate, Italy ('gemellaggio') and Blieskastel, Germany ('Partnerschaft'). In the United Kingdom, the term \\"twin towns\\" is most commonly used; the term \\"sister cities\\" is generally used for agreements with towns and cities in the Americas. In mainland Europe, the most commonly used terms are \\"twin towns,\\" \\"partnership towns,\\" \\"partner towns,\\" and \\"friendship towns.\\" The European Commission uses the term \\"twinned towns\\" and refers to the process as \\"town twinning.\\" Spain uses the term \\"ciudades hermanadas,\\" which means \\"sister cities.\\" Germany, Poland, and the Czech Republic use Partnerstadt (De) / miasto partnerskie (Pl) / partnersk√© mƒõsto (Cz), which translate as \\"partner town\\" or \\"partner city.\\" France uses ville jumel√©e (jumelage, twinned town or city), and Italy has gemellaggio (twinning) and comune gemellato (twinned municipality). In the Netherlands, the term is partnerstad or stedenband (\\"city bond,\\" when providing mutual support). In Greece, the word Œ±Œ¥ŒµŒªœÜŒøœÄŒøŒØŒ∑œÉŒ∑ (adelfopiisifraternisation) has been adopted. In Iceland, the terms vinab√¶ir (friend towns) and vinaborgir (friend cities) are used. In the former Soviet Bloc, \\"twin towns\\" and \\"twin cities\\" were used, along with –≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–∞-–ø–æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–º—ã (Ru) (sworn brother cities). The Americas, South Asia, and Australasia use the term \\"sister cities\\" or \\"twin cities.\\" In China, the term is ÂèãÂ•ΩÂüéÂ∏Ç (y«íuh«éo ch√©ngsh√¨friendship city). Sometimes, other government bodies enter into a twinning relationship, such as the agreement between the provinces of Hainan in China and Jeju-do in South Korea. The douzelage is a town twinning association with one town from each of the member states of the European Union. Despite the term often being used interchangeably, with the term \\"friendship city,\\" this may mean a relationship with a more limited scope in comparison to a sister city relationship, and friendship city relationships are mayor-to-mayor agreements. = City diplomacy = City diplomacy is a form of paradiplomacy that involves discussions between officials and residents of different cities. Often these cities will be located in different countries. As such city diplomacy involves a sort of international relations that works in parallel to the conventional system involving embassies, ambassadors and treaties negotiated at the level of nation states. According to Rodrigo Tavares, the earliest formal attempts to establish city diplomacy across national boundaries took place in the 19th century. Only a handful of cities were involved in the 19th century efforts; it wasn't until the turn of the millennium that it became much more common. The first priority of those carrying out city diplomacy typically overlaps with the core aims of municipal government - improving the lives of local residents. Yet they will often collaborate with peers in other cities to work on issues of planet wide concern, such as efforts to address climate change. The phrase \\"city diplomacy\\" is formally used in the workings of the United Cities and Local Governments and the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group , and is recognised by the USC Center on Public Diplomacy. A March 2014 debate in the British House of Lords acknowledged the evolution of town twinning into city diplomacy, particularly in matters off trade and tourism, but also in culture and post- conflict reconciliation. The importance of cities developing \\"their own foreign economic policies on trade, foreign investment, tourism and attracting foreign talent\\" has also been highlighted by the World Economic Forum. In addition to C40, other organisations facilitating city diplomacy include the World Cities Summit, the Smart City Expo World Congress, the Strong City Network and 100 Resilient Cities. As of 2016, there were over 125 such multilateral networks and forums to facilitate international collaboration between different municipal authorities. Research showed that the mayors of the cities play an active role in city diplomacyBurksiene V., Dvorak J., Burbulytƒó-Tsiskarishvili G.

Europe  Column dedicated to Paris in RomeThe earliest known town twinning in Europe was between Paderborn, Germany, and Le Mans, France, in 836. Starting in 1905, Keighley in West Yorkshire, England, had a twinning arrangement with French communities Suresnes and Puteaux. The first recorded modern twinning agreement was between Keighley and Poix-du-Nord in Nord, France, in 1920 following the end of the First World War. This was initially referred to as an adoption of the French town; formal twinning charters were not exchanged until 1986. The practice was continued after the Second World War as a way to promote mutual understanding and cross-border projects of mutual benefit. For example, Coventry twinned with Stalingrad and later with Dresden as an act of peace and reconciliation, all three cities having been heavily bombed during the war. The City of Bath formed an \\"Alkmaar Adoption committee\\" in March 1945, when the Dutch city was still occupied by the German Army in the final months of the war, and children from each city took part in exchanges in 1945 and 1946. Similarly, in 1947, Bristol Corporation (later Bristol City Council) sent five 'leading citizens' on a goodwill mission to Hanover. Reading in 1947 was the first British town to form links with a former \\"enemy\\" city - D√ºsseldorf, a link that still exists. Since 9 April 1956 Rome and Paris have been exclusively and reciprocally twinned with each other, following the motto: \\"Only Paris is worthy of Rome; only Rome is worthy of Paris.\\" Within Europe, town twinning is supported by the European Union. The support scheme was established in 1989. In 2003 an annual budget of about was allocated to about 1,300 projects. The Council of European Municipalities and Regions also works closely with the Commission (DG Education and Culture) to promote modern, high quality twinning initiatives and exchanges that involve all sections of the community. It has launched a website dedicated to town twinning. As of 1995, the European Union had more than 7,000 bilateral relationships involving almost 10,000 European municipalities, primarily French (2837 twinnings) and German (2485 twinnings). Public art has been used to celebrate twin town links, for instance in the form of seven mural paintings in the centre of the town of Sutton, Greater London. The five main paintings show a number of the main features of the London Borough of Sutton and its four twin towns, along with the heraldic shield of each above the other images. Each painting also features a plant as a visual representation of its town's environmental awareness. In the case of Sutton this is in a separate smaller painting (above its main one) showing a beech tree, intended as a symbol of prosperity and from which Carshalton Beeches in the borough derives its name. Another example of the use of public art is the wall sculpture of the partner cities of Munich, Germany. A recent study has concluded that geographical distance has very little, if any, influence upon communities' selections of a twin town. Twinned towns are often chosen because of similarities between them; thus about 15 towns in Wales are twinned with towns in Brittany, and Oxford is with Bonn, Leiden, Grenoble and other university cities. In Italy a good example of Twinnings is Rovigo with Viernheim, Bedford and Tulcea. Many former West German cities are twinned with former East German cities; these twinning links were established before the fall of the Iron Curtain. Famous examples are the partnerships of Hanover and Leipzig, both of which have important trade fair grounds, or between Hamburg and Dresden. The first US-German town twinning was in 1947 between Worthington, Minnesota and Crailsheim. St Petersburg in Russia holds the record for the largest number of partnership arrangements with other communities. In June 2012, the Scottish village of Dull and the US town of Boring, Oregon, agreed to twin their municipalities to promote tourism in both places, playing on their names. Recently some towns have made novelty twinning arrangements with fictional or virtual locations. Wincanton, England is partnered with Ankh-Morpork from Terry Pratchett's Discworld books. Town twinning has increasingly been used to form strategic international business links. For example, in the 1990s, when the Nottingham City Council in the UK considered installing a tram network, it consulted experts from its twin city of Karlsruhe, which has one of the most extensive and efficient tram networks in Germany. With assistance from Karlsruhe's specialist engineers, Nottingham completed its second tram line in 2013. In 2014, Bristol and New Orleans announced their intention to form a 'tuning' partnership based on a shared musical heritage and culture offer, at the initiative of Bristol Mayor George Ferguson. Annecy, France and Nerima, Tokyo have for several years shared a partnership based on their \\"co-existent animation industry.\\"  North America  Dull, Perth and Kinross is twinned with Boring, Oregon Toledo, United States twinned with Toledo, Spain in 1931 and was the first city in North America to engage in town twinning. Vancouver, Canada twinned with Odessa, Ukraine in 1944 was the first in Canada and second in North America while Denver, United States twinned with Brest, France was the second twinned city in the United States. Liberal, Kansas was twinned with Olney, United Kingdom in 1950, and the cities have run a joint Pancake Day race ever since. Littleton, CO twinned with Bega, Australia in 1961. Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan, was twinned with Seattle, Washington in 1973. Rochester, Minnesota and Knebworth, UK are both centers for primary medical research, and they twinned in 1967. Ontario, California has five sister cities around the world. They are Brockville, Ontario, Canada (since 1977), Guam√∫chil, Sinaloa, Mexico (since 1982), Mocorito, Sinaloa, Mexico (since 1982), Los Mochis, Sinaloa, Mexico (since 1988), and Winterthur, Canton of Z√ºrich, Switzerland. Oakville, Ontario is twinned with Dorval, Quebec, Huai'an, China and Neyagawa, Osaka, Japan. Town twinning begins for a variety of reasons. Generally, partner towns have similar demographics and size. They may arise from business connections, travel, similar industries, diaspora communities, or shared history. For example, the partnership between Portland, Oregon and Bologna, Italy arose from shared industries in biotechnology and education, and a \\"similar attitude towards food,\\" whereas Chicago's link with Warsaw, Poland began with Chicago's historic Polish community. The twinning of Indianapolis with Monza, Italy is due to both cities' long association with auto racing. Los Angeles City Hall with twin towns fingerpost A twin towns program was instituted in the United States in 1956 when President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed a citizen diplomacy initiative. Sister Cities International (SCI) was originally a program of the National League of Cities, but it became a separate corporation in 1967 due to the growth and popularity of the program. Thessaloniki stele, in sister city Melbourne Twin town cultural events include the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, D.C. honouring Washington's twin relationship with Tokyo City. Many twinned towns developed business agreements with their partners. For example, Vermont's Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream company opened a factory in the Republic of Karelia in Russia and offered the same profit-sharing plan to its Russian employees.  Asia  Esfahan Street in Kuala Lumpur (top) and Kuala Lumpur Avenue in Isfahan (bottom). China's sister city relationships are managed by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. Town twinning is supported in Japan by the Council of Local Authorities for International Relations, a joint agency of local governments established by the Japanese government in 1988 (similar to Sister Cities International, its counterpart in the US). More recently, Tokyo has begun to actively promote 'city diplomacy' with other global cities at the initiative of its governor Yoichi Masuzoe. Linguistic reasons Relationships between communities can also arise because of shared names; they may be named after one community (as in the case of C√≥rdoba), they may share names (as in the case of Santiago de Compostela), or their names may have a common etymology.Road sign of Artieda de Arag√≥n and Emiliano Zapata, an autonomous Zapatista municipality. These similarities usually arise from sharing the same or related language, or from having been a colony or previously conquered. Political significance Twinning towns and cities is sometimes done for political purposes. The Hungarian city Gy√∂ngy√∂s was twinned with the Azerbaijani city of Shusha in 2013, signing the twinning agreement with representatives from the Azerbaijani government; Hungary recognises Shusha as part of Azerbaijan, even though since the end of the Karabakh War it has been controlled by the military forces of Armenia and the unrecognised Artsakh (de jure part of Azerbaijan). An attempt was made in 2003 by Preston city councillors in England to twin with the Palestinian town of Nablus in the name of solidarity. = Termination of sister city relationships as the result of a dispute = * In 2012, the city of Nanjing suspended their sister city relationship with Nagoya after Nanking Massacre denialist statements by Nagoya's mayor, Takashi Kawamura. * In 2013, the Italian cities of Milan, Venice, and Turin, formerly twinned with Saint Petersburg, suspended their links due to Russia's passage of anti-gay legislation.Claire Bigg, Sister Cities Ramp Up Russia Boycott Over Antigay Law, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (19 July 2013). Activists in California circulated petitions urging California cities and counties with relationships with Russian counterparts to take similar steps. * In 2014, Prague terminated its partnership with Saint Petersburg and Moscow because of the Russian military intervention in Ukraine. Moscow had been Prague's partner city since 1995. * In 2017, the mayor of Osaka, Hirofumi Yoshimura, ended the city's 60-year relationship with San Francisco due to the erection of a memorial to comfort women in downtown San Francisco.Jacey Fortin, 'Comfort Women' Statue in San Francisco Leads a Japanese City to Cut Ties, New York Times (25 November 2017).Adam Taylor, Osaka mayor to end sister city status with San Francisco over 'comfort women' statue, Washington Post (25 November 2017). Similarly, the cities of Glendale, California and Higashi≈çsaka, Japan came close to terminating their twinning in 2013 and 2014 because of an ongoing dispute over Glendale's support for the erection of a statue dedicated to Korean comfort women in a city park. * In July 2020, the town council of Nieuwegein, a Dutch city south of Utrecht, voted to end its friendship with Pu≈Çawy in eastern Poland, citing \\"gay free zones\\" as the reason.

In audio engineering, a mix-minus or clean feed is a particular setup of a mixing console or matrix mixer, such that an output of the mixer contains everything except a designated input. Mix-minus is often used to prevent echoes or feedback in broadcast or sound reinforcement systems. Examples The most common situation in which a mix-minus is used is when a telephone hybrid is connected to a console, usually at a radio station. The person on the telephone hears all relevant feeds, usually an identical mix to that of the master bus, including the DJ's mic feed, except that the caller does not hear their own voice. Because the feed being returned to the telephone has an identical mix, minus only one input, it is most efficient to employ a mix-minus as opposed to creating and mixing for a new independent output bus.. Mix-minus is also often used together with IFB systems in electronic news gathering (ENG) for television news reporters and interview subjects speaking to a host from a remote outside broadcast (OB) location. Because of the delay that is introduced in most means of transmission (including satellite feeds and audio over IP connections), the remote subject's voice has to be removed from his earpiece. Otherwise, the subject would hear themselves with a slight (but very distracting) delay. Another common example is in the field of sound reinforcement. Consider a room with sound stations for multiple users, each station containing a microphone and a loudspeaker. Such a room might be used in a government house of parliament. The microphone in station #1 would feed the loudspeakers in every other station except station #1. In other words, station #1 receives a mix of all microphones minus the station #1 microphone. This enables all participants to hear each other clearly but minimizes problems with acoustic feedback. Mix- minus is also used with VoIP communication when recording for podcasts: mix- minus removes the caller's voice from the VoIP call, but allows them to hear all other channels available at the mixing console (mixer). Some broadcast mixing desks, notably those designed in house by the BBC, maintain a separate mix bus for clean feeds. This approach is technically different, and arguably more flexible than most implementations of mix-minus, but the end result is the same.

(RUG) is an international company set up in 1977 by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is involved in theatre, film, television, video and concert productions, merchandising, magazine publishing, records and music publishing. The name is inspired by a phrase from the children's book series The Railway Series (which also inspired Webber to create Starlight Express) in which Thomas the Tank Engine and other locomotives are referred to as \\"Really Useful Engines\\". History The company was set up in 1977 when Lloyd Webber, frustrated with the terms of his contract with the impresario Robert Stigwood, decided to take greater control over the management of his creative works. All Lloyd Webber compositions and productions created from that point have been owned by the company. The Really Useful Group was floated on the stock market in 1986. Four years later, Lloyd Webber took it back into private ownership, selling 30% to film and music group PolyGram to fund the cost of buying back shares. In 1995, PolyGram was bought by Canadian conglomerate Seagram, with the Really Useful stake being passed to its own film and music subsidiary, Universal. In 1999, Lloyd Webber paid $75m for Universal's 30% stake, giving the Really Useful Group 100% ownership of all the composer's works. Divisions =Really Useful Theatre Company= The Really Useful Theatre Company produces and manages plays and musicals, mainly, but not limited to those written by Lloyd Webber. It is also responsible for licensing its productions worldwide. In the 1990s, RUT mainly produced shows on its own, but more recently has again developed partnerships with other producers and production companies, notably Bill Kenwright, to produce its works, as it had done in the 1980s with Cameron Mackintosh. Among its productions and co- productions are: *Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat ‚Äì Lloyd Webber/Tim Rice ‚Äì London, Broadway, Los Angeles, worldwide *Jesus Christ Superstar ‚Äì Lloyd Webber/Rice ‚Äì London, Broadway, worldwide *Evita ‚Äì Lloyd Webber/Rice ‚Äì London, Broadway, worldwide *Tell Me on a Sunday ‚Äì Lloyd Webber/Don Black ‚Äì London, UK tour *Cats ‚Äì Lloyd Webber/T.

Until recently, these had consisted of lower budget straight-to- video versions of the shows (notably Cats, Jesus Christ Superstar and Joseph), but in 2004 the Really Useful Films completed the film The Phantom of the Opera, directed by Joel Schumacher and starring Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum, which was nominated for three Academy Awards and three Golden Globes. It has also released DVD and video versions of Lloyd Webber's 50th birthday concert at the Royal Albert Hall, the 2001 Masterpiece ‚Äì Andrew Lloyd Webber in China concert and a musical version of the Gruffalo. The film director Nick Morris is regularly involved with the films division. =Really Useful Records= Really Useful Records produces cast albums of Lloyd Webber musicals. From 1986 until Lloyd Webber regained full control of the company in 1999, Really Useful Records had an exclusive deal with PolyGram to release albums through its Polydor label. Really Useful continues to release its albums and DVDs through Universal, current owners of PolyGram. Aside from cast albums, Lloyd Webber has also produced albums for Marti Webb, Sarah Brightman, Connie Fisher, Andrea Ross and Michael Ball via the label. Lee Mead, who won the lead role in 2007's West End revival of Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat by taking part in BBC One's Any Dream Will Do! recorded a single of the song \\"Any Dream Will Do\\". The contest's third-placed Lewis Bradley and second-placed Keith Jack joined him on \\"Close Every Door To Me\\". Really Useful Records released the double-A side single to raise funds for the BBC's annual Children in Need charity appeal. =LW Theatres= LW Theatres owns and manages six West End theatres: *Adelphi Theatre (in association with the Nederlander Organization) *Cambridge Theatre *Gillian Lynne Theatre *Her Majesty's Theatre *London Palladium *Theatre Royal, Drury Lane The group also includes the Off West End venue The Other Palace, formerly known as the St James Theatre. Lloyd Webber purchased the Palace Theatre in 1983, followed by the Gillian Lynne and the Adelphi. In 1999, Lloyd Webber and NatWest Equity Partners bought the Stoll Moss group, owners of 10 London theatres, including the London Palladium and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, for ¬£85 million from Australian businesswoman Janet Holmes √† Court, and formed Really Useful Theatres. In 2004, operational control of the Queen's Theatre reverted from Really Useful Theatres back to Cameron Mackintosh's Delfont Mackintosh Theatres. The transfer of operational control of the adjoining Gielgud Theatre from Really Useful Theatres to Delfont Mackintosh Theatres followed two years later. On 11 July 2005, the company sold four theatres (the Apollo, the Duchess, the Lyric, and the Garrick) to Nimax Theatres Ltd, a company owned by Broadway producer Max Weitzenhoffer, who previously had been a rival bidder for the Stoll Moss theatres, and Nica Burns, production director of Really Useful Theatres. Lloyd Webber invested ¬£10 million of the proceeds from the sales in October 2005 to buy out his ownership partners Bridgepoint (formerly NatWest Equity Partners), and the group was renamed Really Useful Theatres Group. The Palace was sold to Nimax in 2012.Andrew Lloyd Webber Sells London's Palace Theatre In 2014, the group split into two companies, and the owner of the theatres was named Really Useful Theatres.Dennys, Harriet. \\"Lord Lloyd- Webber splits theatre group to expand on a global stage\\", The Telegraph, 24 March 2014.

Published beginning in 2000, the magazine was available in conjunction with the programmes in all Really Useful Theatres. 'Theatregoer magazine was sold to Bandwidth Communications, the publisher of Whatsonstage.com, in April 2005. =Other interests= The Really Useful Group has, in the past, set up sub-labels to cater for pop and dance acts, such as Carpet Records, featuring Timmy Mallett's Bombalurina (\\"Itsy Bitsy Teeny Weeny Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\\") and Doctor Spin (\\"Tetris\\"); and It Records, home to My Life Story in the late 1990s. The name Carpet Records was a play on the acronym RUG, of the Really Useful Group. =Charitable donation= The group on 27 June 2007 announced that it would donate all receipts from two special performances of a revived West End production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat to the BBC's Children in Need charity appeal, which would benefit from ticket sales for 16 July's preview and performance of 16 November, on the night of the annual Children in Need telethon. Viewers of a BBC One television show, Any Dream Will Do! had voted 25-year-old West End ensemble player and understudy Lee Mead to take role of Joseph in the production. Children in Need had benefited by more than ¬£500,000 in income from viewers' voting on premium-rate telephone lines, host Graham Norton said during the contest's 9 June 2007 final.

The Shmel is designed, produced and exported by the Russian Federation and previously by the Soviet Union. It entered service with the Soviet Armed Forces at the end of the 1980s as the successor for the RPO Rys. Description The RPO-A is a single-shot, self-contained tube shaped launcher that operates much like the LAW rocket launchers, a sealed tube, carried in a man-pack in pairs. The same person can remove the tube, place it in firing position, and launch the weapon without assistance. After launch, the tube is discarded. All models are externally similar. Designed to defeat concealed enemy firing positions, disable lightly armored and automotive vehicles, destroy enemy manpower. The aiming range of a flamethrower with a diopter sight is 600 meters, with an OPO optical sight - 450 m, OPO-1 - up to 850 m. =Ammunition= Each weapon contains a single rocket, of which there are three varieties. The basic rocket is the RPO-A, which has a thermobaric warhead and is designed for attacking soft targets under moderate cover. The RPO-Z is the incendiary warhead (Rus. –∑–∞–∂–∏–≥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π / Zazhigatel'nyy, Incendiary) designed to spread fire and ignite targets. There is a smoke-producing warhead (Rus. –¥—ã–º–æ–≤–æ–π / Dymovoy, Smoke) offered, the RPO-D.

When Ward returned to sea, he served once more in the Mediterranean and then saw duty off the African coast in interdicting the slave trade. He next served in the West Indies, helping to prevent a resurgence of piracy. Upon his return to the United States, he taught courses in ordnance and gunnery at the Naval School at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. These courses were later published as An Elementary Course of Instruction in Ordnance and Gunnery. On October 10, 1845, the new Naval Academy opened in Annapolis, Maryland; Lt. Ward was one of the five founders of this naval academy. He was one of the first line officers to pass along the benefits of his own experience to young midshipmen. One of the most scholarly officers of the Navy of his day, Ward held the office of executive officer (a post which later became that of the Commandant of Midshipmen), with collateral duties as instructor of gunnery and steam engineering. The advent of the war with Mexico prompted many naval officers and men to seek assignments on ships serving in Mexican waters. Detached from the Academy, Ward took command of the in 1847 and served in that capacity for the duration of the war. After a period spent waiting for orders, he was given command of the steamer in 1848 and remained on her through 1850. After intermittent periods awaiting orders and serving at the Washington and Philadelphia Navy Yards, Ward took command of the and took her to the African coast to hunt slave ships. During this time, in his off- duty hours, he proceeded to work on another textbook‚ÄîA Manual of Naval Tactics‚Äîa scholarly work which would run to four editions after its initial publication in 1859.

The photo shows some of the ship's officers and men demonstrating how her late commanding officer, Commander James H. Ward, was sighting her bow gun when he was mortally wounded on 27 June 1861, during an action with Confederate forces at Mathias Point, Virginia. The gun is a 32 pounder smoothbore, of 60 hundredweight, on a \\"Novelty Carriage\\". This mounting was developed by Commander Ward before the Civil War In 1860, Ward served at the New York Navy Yard, where he wrote a popular treatise on steam engineering, entitled Steam for the Million. In the spring of 1861, with the Southern states leaving the Union and Confederate forces mounting a siege at Fort Sumter, South Carolina, Gideon Welles summoned Ward to Washington to plan for a relief expedition for Sumter. Ward volunteered to lead it, but opposition, notably from General Winfield Scott (who perceived it as being futile), forced cancellation of the plans. Ward pressed for front line service, proposing that a \\"flying squadron\\" be established in the Chesapeake Bay for use against Confederate naval and land forces threatening that area south of the Union capital. The idea was approved, and the squadron took shape. With the steamer Thomas Freeborn serving as Ward's flagship, the steamers Freelance, Alliance plus three coastal survey ships made up his flotilla. The newly composed unit‚Äîlater known as the Potomac Flotilla‚Äîsaw its first action on June 1, when guns from Ward's ships silenced Confederate shore batteries at Aquia Creek, Virginia during the Battle of Aquia Creek. On June 27, at the Battle of Mathias Point, Ward sent a landing party ashore to dislodge Southern forces from another battery at Mathias Point, in King George County, Virginia, but it encountered heavy resistance. The Federals gave up the attack and retired under heavy sniper and cannon fire to their ships. Ward brought his flotilla in close to the shoreline to provide gunfire support for the retreating landing party. As he was sighting the bow gun in his flagship, Thomas Freeborn, Ward was struck by a bullet in his abdomen and fell to the deck, mortally wounded. He died within an hour. He was the great-grandfather of actor Andy Devine. Namesakes USS Ward (DD-139) was named for him, as was Fort Ward, one of the defenses of Washington during the American Civil War. Ward Hall, site of the US Naval Academy's computing center, is named after James Ward, first commandant of midshipmen.

The town had a population of 3,607 as of the 2016 census. Castleblayney is near the border with County Armagh in Northern Ireland, and lies on the N2 road from Dublin to Derry and Letterkenny. Geography The town lies above the western shore of Lough Muckno, the largest lake in County Monaghan. The River Fane flows eastwards from the lake to the Irish Sea at Dundalk in County Louth. As the Irish name of the lake ('the place where pigs swim') suggests, the area is associated with the Black Pig's Dyke, also known locally in parts of Counties Cavan and Monaghan as the Worm Ditch, an ancient Iron Age boundary of Ulster. A few miles to the north-east is the highest elevation in County Monaghan, 'Mullyash', at altitude 317 m (1,034 ft). Markets and fair days were held in the town since the 17th century, but these no longer take place. History The area was originally known as Baile na Lorgan (\\"town of the long low ridge\\"), anglicised as 'Ballynalurgan'.Patrick McKay, A Dictionary of Ulster Place-Names, p. 37. The Institute of Irish Studies, The Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, 1999. It was also sometimes called Caisle√°n Mathghamhna. =17th and 18th centuries= The town of Castleblayney originated in the Tudor conquest of Gaelic Ulster in the Nine Years' War of 1594‚Äì1603. In 1611, the Crown granted forfeited lands in the area previously owned by the MacMahon chieftains to Sir Edward Blayney of Montgomeryshire in Wales for his service to Queen Elizabeth I. Sir Edward was later created The 1st Baron Blayney, in July 1621. King James I had already granted him appropriated Augustinian church land (or 'termon') at Muckno Friary on the northeastern side of the lake in the Churchill area (Mullandoy) in 1606/7. The small town 'founded' by Sir Edward Blayney in 1611 or 1612 is recorded as being called Castleblayney at least as early as 1663. Muckno is also the name given to the Catholic parish (St. Mary's, Castleblayney, and St Patrick's, Oram, just three miles north-east of the town), which is part of the Diocese of Clogher. The Church of Ireland parish is also called Muckno (St Maeldoid's), and is part of the Church of Ireland Diocese of Clogher. The Parish of Muckno covers most of the areas around the lough and town. Originally the Parish of Muckno was restricted to the area to the east and north of the lake and the Derrycreevey River, i.e. the Oram area. With the establishment of the Church of Ireland church and the Blayney seat on the southern side of the lake, the area of the new town became part of Muckno. The Catholic parish followed a similar pattern at the end of the Penal Laws period. Prior to this, the area now covered by the town was part of Clontibret parish. Following the arrival of the Blayney family, the nucleus of the town developed around the original Blayney Castle, above the western shore overlooking the lough. The old monastic and parish church site fell into disrepair and largely disappeared, though it was used as a graveyard that has since been partially restored. For the first hundred years the 'town' was little more than a vulnerable, besieged fortification due to the widespread instability, insurgency and wars throughout Britain and Ireland for much of the 17th century. The piecemeal settlement of English and even some French Huguenot incomers, all of the Protestant faith in contrast to the continuing Catholicism of most of the native population, was followed by a significant influx of largely Ulster-Scots settlers after 1690 when greater security prevailed. Population displacement and settlement, along with gradual urban and commercial development, the crossroads location, the National Schools system and the Famine ‚Äì as well as the incorporation of the town into the rail network (1849) ‚Äì all helped hasten the decline of the vernacular Irish spoken in the area. However, in rural districts to the south and south-east of the town ‚Äì particularly Lisdoonan and the barony of Farney as well as parts of neighbouring South Armagh ‚Äì the language was quite widely spoken among country people and written by local scribes until the mid-19th century. Some native speakers of Irish remained into the 20th century. In 1762 a demonstration occurred in the town accompanied by a threatening military presence. This was connected with the 'Oakboys' movement that was active in the county. The protest was about compulsory work ‚Äì to repair public roads as well as private roads and avenues in demesnes owned by the gentry ‚Äì that was exacted from agricultural labourers for no wages. =The 11th Baron Blayney= Andrew Blayney, 11th Baron Blayney The modern planned town ‚Äì reminiscent of Plantation towns with its characteristic wide main street and with long, narrow individual gardens to the rear and out of sight ‚Äì dates from c. 1830. The modern town was largely laid out under the direction of Andrew Blayney, 11th Baron Blayney (1770‚Äì1834), who inherited the family peerage and the large Blayney Estate as an adolescent in 1784. By about 1800 the then young Lord Blayney had ordered and implemented major reforms in Castleblayney, greatly improving the prosperity and appearance of the town. Educated in France and Germany, the 11th Lord Blayney is famous for his distinguished military career, eventually rising to the rank of Lieutenant-General, having served in the West Indies, South America, southern Africa and the Napoleonic Wars as commander of the 89th Foot, popularly known as 'Blayney's Bloodhounds'. As a peer, he was very active in the suppression of the revolt of the United Irishmen in 1798. It was the 11th Lord Blayney who had the modern Blayney Castle (also known as Castle Blayney) constructed around the year 1800. In 1799 Lord Blayney commissioned Robert Woodgate, a former student of Sir John Soane, to design the new Blayney Castle. Woodgate, a distinguished young architect, had first come over to Ireland in 1791 to supervise Soane's plans for Baronscourt, the new country house of John Hamilton, 1st Marquess of Abercorn, near Newtownstewart in County Tyrone. The new Blayney Castle was built in a restrained late Georgian style. It is thought that this new 'castle' (in reality a country house), located in the townland of Onomy, was built close to the site of the original Blayney Castle, of which nothing now survives above ground. The house built for the 11th Lord Blayney was later, in the 1850s and early 1860s, substantially altered and enlarged for Henry Thomas Hope and his wife. Blayney Castle, renamed Hope Castle in the early 1850s, stands in a demesne or park on the eastern edge of Castleblayney town itself. It is thought that this demesne pre-dates the current 'castle'; that large parts of it had already been laid out by the early 1770s. The demesne was substantially improved for the 11th Lord Blayney by William Sawrey Gilpin in the early 1830s. However, the demesne has deteriorated since it came into public ownership in the 1980s. Almost all of the large Italianate Victorian extension to Hope Castle was demolished by Monaghan County Council in the 1980s. The 11th Lord Blayney also provided for the erection in Castleblayney of the current church buildings of the Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian churches, being tolerant in religion if traditionalist in politics and strongly supportive of Empire and the Anglo-Irish 'Ascendancy'. He also had a Market House built, on to which the Courthouse was later superimposed in the quasi-centre of the town. It and the former Alms Houses (1876), which were interdenominationally managed, are the only civic buildings of any architectural merit in the town. As for older dwellings, a row of formerly Muckno Estate workers' cottages in Church St, possibly of Continental style, is of fine design and quality (apart from modern PVC windows). Some more substantial bourgeois houses in the square close to the Castle gates have Georgian echoes. The courthouse will soon undergo major refurbishment and restoration. About 40 structures and buildings are designated as being of 'regional or local importance'. In the early 1840s, what is now St Mary's Hospital was erected as a Workhouse for the very poor. In the course of the year 1849, following the dire effects of the Famine, it catered for up to 2000 inmates in an extreme state of destitution and misery. Its own graveyard is nearby. =Hope family and after= In 1853, Cadwallader Blayney, 12th Baron Blayney, sometime Member of Parliament for Monaghan, sold Blayney Castle and what remained of the Blayney Estate to Henry Thomas Hope from Deepdene in Surrey, an extremely wealthy businessman who had also formerly served as an Member of Parliament at Westminster. The 12th Baron was the last Baron Blayney. The Castle was renamed 'Hope Castle', as it is still called. Hope gave the Georgian castle with its splendid prospect a Victorian makeover that the present prettified building retains, externally at least. 'Castle' has always been a misnomer, since it was more of a 'Big House', mansion or manor house than a castle. After his death in 1862, Hope's wife Anne inherited the estate. Soon after 1887 the Castle and demesne fell to the next heir, Hope's grandson Lord Francis Hope (1866‚Äì1941), who was famous for having sold the renowned family heirloom, the 'Hope Diamond'. Rather like his father The 6th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne, Lord Francis lived very extravagantly and, despite his once vast family fortune, was declared bankrupt in 1896. From 1894 to 1902, he was married to May Yoh√©, the American actress. After 1916 Lord Francis no longer resided in the Castle or in Ireland. He succeeded his elder brother to become The 8th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne in late May 1928. Hope Castle was leased between 1900 and 1904 to Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, a son of Queen Victoria. The Duke served during those years as the commander of British military forces in Ireland, whose official residence was the Master's House at the Royal Hospital, in Kilmainham, Dublin. The Duke leased Hope Castle from the Pelham-Clinton-Hope family as his private country residence during these years. The 8th Duke of Newcastle-under-Lyne (1866-1941; previously known as Lord Francis Hope) sold his life interest in the castle and the estate in 1928, the same year he succeeding to the dukedom, short of cash and unable to access the capital endowed into his grandmother's monetary trusts. What remained of the estate was subsequently broken up and used, in part, for local political patronage. During 'The Emergency' (World War II), the old woods on the Black Island in Lough Muckno were cut down, and left as a for some time. Hope Castle in 2008, prior to fire Between 1919 and 1921, during the Anglo-Irish military hostilities over independence, the Castle was used as a barracks by the British Army. For some time afterwards it functioned as a hospital, and from 1943 to 1974 it was occupied by Franciscan nuns who also managed an adjacent guesthouse. In the 1980s Monaghan County Council purchased both Hope Castle and its surrounding demesne or park. It then proceeded in the 1980s to demolish the large Italianate Victorian extension to the castle. The council also allowed the remaining Woodgate interiors to be ripped out at this time. After some years of neglect, the castle has been used for catering and hotel purposes set in what is now a Leisure Park with golf course. The current Castleblayney Golf Club adopted the Blayney family coat of arms, with its three nags' heads. In October 2010 the castle was burnt down in an arson attack. Rail services in the town ceased on New Year's Day 1960. On the 7 March 1976 a bomb exploded in the towns main street, outside the Three Star Inn pub, killing Patrick Mone (56) & injuring 17 others. The attack was one of several cross-border attacks linked to the Glenanne gang during the worst sectarian violence of The Troubles.Anne Cadwallader - Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland pg.239, 240 Council The modern town of Castleblayney is administered by Monaghan County Council. It forms part of the Carrickmacross-Castleblayney Municipal District which elects six of the eighteen members of the council. For over one hundred and sixty years the town had its own local or Town council until May 2014. Town government began in Castleblayney on 17 May 1853 when 21 Town Commissioners were elected on foot of a proclamation by Edward Eliot, 3rd Earl of St Germans, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, dated 10 April 1853. In 1865 the Town Commissioners voted to bring the town under the Town Improvement (Ireland) Act 1847 and in 1899 the nine Town Commissioners were replaced by an Urban District Council, re-designated as a Town Council under the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 brought town government to an end replaced it with the integrated municipal district (town and rural areas) and county system. Facilities An Eaglais Amenity and Heritage Centre, Castleblayney Amenities in Castleblayney include a Community Enterprise Centre which opened in 1987. There is one shopping centre is located in the town, of which SuperValu is the anchor tenant. Transport The town is served by Bus √âireann, Ulsterbus and several private coach companies. A‚Ç¨120m by-pass from Castleblayney to Clontibret opened on 5 November 2007, linking Castleblayney directly to the M1 Motorway and to Dublin. The bypass consists of 16 kilometres of 2+1 carriageway. Castleblayney is no longer served by railway. Castleblayney railway station opened on 15 February 1849, closed to passengers on 14 October 1957, and finally closed altogether on 1 January 1960. Arts and culture The √çontas Arts & Community Resource Centre is an arts and community facility located in a purpose-built facility in the town. It offers a wide range of arts activities, including drama, music and dance. Sport The local Gaelic Athletic Association club, Castleblayney Faugh's GAC, was founded in November 1905. There are also two soccer clubs located in Castleblayney, Blayney Academy FC formed in 2010 and Blayney Rovers FC. Education Castleblayney Central National School The town has two second-level schools, Our Lady's Castleblayney and Castleblayney College. The latter is a co-educational school which had a ‚Ç¨5 million extension built recently. There are five national schools in Castleblayney; Scoil na gCail√≠n√≠, Scoil Mhuire na mBuachaill√≠, Convent Junior School, The Central School and Gaelscoil Lorgan.

Work to raise the height of the original natural lake was started in 1929. It was controversially dammed after the UK Parliament passed a Private Act giving Manchester Corporation permission to build the reservoir to supply drinking water to the city. The decision caused a public outcry because the farming villages of Measand and Mardale Green would be flooded and the valley altered forever. The reservoir is now owned by United Utilities. It supplies about 25% of the North West's water supply. Etymology Haweswater is derived from Old Norse or Old English. 'Hafr's lake' refers to the personal Norse name 'Hafr' or in Old English 'H√¶fer'; 'water' or 'w√¶ter' is the dominant term for 'lake' in old English. History Parapet atop the Haweswater Reservoir Haweswater was originally a natural lake about long. A tongue of land at Measand divided the lake almost in two. The upper and lower reaches of the lake were known as High Water and Low Water. In 1929 work started to build the dam wall across the valley floor. At the time of construction, its design was considered to be at the forefront of civil engineering technology because it was the world's first hollow buttress dam. The wall would be created from 44 separate buttressed units joined by flexible joints. When the dam was completed by 1935, it measured long and high. It has a wide parapet that runs atop the length of the dam. Building supplies were brought to the site from the adjoining valleys of Heltondale and Swindale. When the valley was flooded, the dam raised the water level by . This created a reservoir long and up to across at its widest point. It holds up to of water. 1924 map of Haweswater before it was enlarged. Note Mardale Green and the original road on the west bank. 1930s Manchester Corporation Water Works (MCWW) footpath sign at the western end car park Before the valley was flooded in 1935, all the farms and dwellings of the villages of Mardale Green and Measand were demolished, as well as the centuries-old Dun Bull Inn at Mardale Green. The village church was dismantled and the stone used in constructing the dam; all the bodies in the churchyard were exhumed and re-buried at Shap. Today, when the water in the reservoir is low, the remains of the submerged village of Mardale Green can still be seen, including stone walls and the village bridge. Manchester Corporation built a new road along the eastern side of the lake to replace the flooded highway lower in the valley, and the Haweswater Hotel was constructed midway down the length of the reservoir as a replacement for the Dun Bull. The road continues to the western end of Haweswater, to a car park, a popular starting point for a path to the surrounding fells of Harter Fell, Branstree and High Street. Wildlife A map of Haweswater Reservoir from 1948 =Fish= There is a population of schelly fish in the lake, believed to have lived there since the last Ice Age. =RSPB Haweswater= The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) first became involved in Haweswater because of the presence of golden eagles. The organisation currently manages two farms in the area. Until 2015 Haweswater was the only place in England where a golden eagle was resident. A pair of eagles first nested in the valley of Riggindale in 1969, and the male and female of the pairing changed several times over the years, during which sixteen chicks were produced. The female bird disappeared in April 2004, leaving the male alone. There was an RSPB observation post in the valley for people wishing to see the eagle: the last sighting was in November 2015. It was reported that the 20-year old bird may have died of natural causes. In 2012 the RSPB leased two farms from the landowner United Utilities. The aim is to combine the improvement of wildlife habitats and water quality with running a viable sheep farm. Moorland and woodland habitats are being improved for birds as well as the rare small mountain ringlet butterfly. Measures include grip blocking, heather replanting, juniper woodland planting (especially in the ghylls). Literary references Lake District writer and fell walker Alfred Wainwright had this to say on the construction of the Haweswater Dam in his 1955 book A Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells: Haweswater is a 2002 novel by British writer Sarah Hall, set in Mardale at the time of the building of the dam and flooding of the valley.

Commentary career =Soccer= In the 1980s, Dellacamera was the play-by- play announcer for broadcasts of the original Major Indoor Soccer League on ESPN and FNN-Score. He is an ESPN and ABC's play-by-play announcer for their coverage of international soccer, and has been calling the sport for nearly 30 years. Dellacamera did not call the 2006 World Cup final, with Dave O'Brien replacing him, but has teamed with Tommy Smyth to become the lead radio commentary team for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups for ESPN Radio. Zap2It Sun Broadcast Group Soccer America Daily His most famous assignments include the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and 1999 Women's World Cup final between the United States, and China. That match ended in a 0‚Äì0 tie after regulation, with the U.S. women winning in a penalty kick shootout 5‚Äì4 (\\"The shot-save, Scurry!\\" was one of Dellacamera's most memorable calls from that day's shootout, coming from U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry's save on China's third kick of the shootout). He has also called numerous United States' World Cup qualifiers, including Paul Caligiuri's famed 1989 \\"Shot Heard Round the World\\" goal against Trinidad & Tobago. In the early 2000s, he was the lead play-by- play announcer for the WUSA national broadcasts. Dellacamera was NBC's play- by-play voice for soccer at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he did both the men's and women's tournaments. He also did play-by-play for the New York Red Bulls on MSG Network for several years. Dellacamera was the first host of ESPN's PressPass alongside analysts Tommy Smyth and Eddie Mighten. The show airs on ESPN's African, Pacific Rim, and Middle East channels, in addition to ESPN360. Dellacamera has been replaced by Derek Rae, and Mighten has been replaced by Janusz Michallik. Dellacamera served as the lead play-by-play announcer for NBC Sports coverage of Soccer at the 2008 Summer Olympics.Medium Well: Your NBC Olympics lineup - A blog on sports media, news and networks Baltimore Sun On January 16, 2010, Major League Soccer expansion team Philadelphia Union announced that Dellacamera will do play-by-play for local TV broadcasts during its inaugural season.Philadelphia Union Twitter In March 2011, Dellacamera left ESPN to join Fox Soccer as their lead MLS play-by-play commentator. However, in November 2011, the NBC Sports Network signed a deal with the league to broadcast all league matches starting in the 2012 season. He will continue with his duties for the Philadelphia Union. Starting in 2013, Dellacamera will do play-by-play for the New York Cosmos on ONE World Sports when games do not interfere with Union broadcasts.http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/thegoalkeeper/210881331.html In 2014, he was a play-by-play commentator for ESPN Radio for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He was the play-by-play commentator for ONE World Sports's coverage of the 2015 Asian Cup. In 2018, he was a featured commentator alongside Tony Meola on FOX and FS1 for their United States broadcasts of the FIFA World Cup. He also was the 2018 recipient of the National Soccer Hall of Fame's Colin Jose Media Award.https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2018/09/25/13/39/20180925-news- hof-2018-colin-jose-media-award-jp-dellacamera =National Hockey League= In addition to soccer and a few other sports, Dellacamera is a veteran NHL announcer. In the early 1990s, he was a part of the Chicago Wolves for two seasons, being the first play-by-play person on the team. From 2003-04 through 2008-09 he was the television play-by-play voice of the Atlanta Thrashers, and previously served as one of ESPN's many play-by-play commentators. Possibly due to his extensive work in soccer, Dellacamera is one of the few hockey play-by-play broadcasters to use \\"goal\\" in his goal calls (i.e. instead of saying \\"he takes the shot and scores,\\" Dellacamera will say \\"takes the shot, goal\\") Earlier in his career he did play-by-play for both the EHL Long Island Ducks and NAHL Long Island Cougars. =World Junior Hockey= Dellacamera served as the play-by-play announcer for all US National Team games on the NHL Network during the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. Dellacamera replaced Gary Thorne, who was originally scheduled to announce the games.

However, they may form in any type of cave where water enters that has picked up dissolved minerals. Flowstones are formed via the degassing of vadose percolation waters. Flowstone may also form on manmade structures as a result of calcium hydroxide being leached from concrete, lime or mortar. These secondary deposits created outside the cave environment, which mimic the shapes and forms of speleothems, are classified as \\"calthemites\\" and are associated with concrete degradation.Smith, G.K., (2016). ‚ÄúCalcite Straw Stalactites Growing From Concrete Structures‚Äù, Cave and Karst Science, Vol.43, No.1, P.4-10, (April 2016), British Cave Research Association, ISSN 1356-191X.

In Hungarian. or other cave minerals. These minerals are dissolved in the water and are deposited when the water loses its dissolved carbon dioxide through the mechanism of agitation, meaning it can no longer hold the minerals in solution. The flowstone forms when thin layers of these deposits build on each other, sometimes developing more rounded shapes as the deposit gets thicker. There are two common forms of flowstones, tufa and travertine. Tufa is usually formed via the precipitation of calcium carbonate, and is spongy or porous in nature. Travertine is a calcium carbonate deposit often formed in creeks or rivers; its nature is laminated, and it includes such structures as stalagmites and stalactites. The deposits may grade into thin sheets called \\"draperies\\" or \\"curtains\\" where they descend from overhanging portions of the wall. Some draperies are translucent, and some have brown and beige layers that look much like bacon (often termed \\"cave bacon\\"). Though flowstones are among the largest of speleothems, they can still be damaged by a single touch. The oil from human fingers causes the flowing water to avoid the area, which then dries out. Flowstones are also good identifiers of periods of past droughts, since they need some form of water to develop; the lack of that water for long periods of time can leave traces in the rock record via the absence or presence of flowstones, and their detailed structure. =Concrete derived flowstone= Calthemite flowstone on concrete wall, coloured by iron oxide deposited along with the calcium carbonate Calthemite flowstone on concrete wall. A sign of concrete degradation. Flowstone derived from concrete, lime or mortar, can form on manmade structures, much more rapidly than in the natural cave environment due to the different chemistry involved.Hill, C A, and Forti, P, (1997).

Carbon dioxide (CO2) is absorbed into the hyperalkaline leachate solution as it emerges from the concrete. This facilitates the chemical reactions which deposits calcium carbonate (CaCO3) on vertical or sloping surfaces, in the form of flowstone. Concrete derived secondary deposits are classified as \\"calthemites\\". These calcium carbonate deposits mimic the forms and shapes of speleothems, created in caves. e.g. stalagmites, stalactites, flowstone etc. It is most likely that calthemite flowstone is precipitated from leachate solution as calcite, \\"in preference to the other, less stable polymorphs, aragonite and vaterite.\\" Other trace elements such as iron from rusting reinforcing or copper oxide from pipework may be transported by the leachate and deposited at the same time as the CaCO3. This may cause the calthemites to take on colours of the leached oxides.White W.B., (1997), ‚ÄúColor of Speleothems‚Äù, Cave Minerals of the World, (2nd Edition) Hill C. and Forti P.

It was established in 1997. The term \\"KEK\\" is also used to refer to the laboratory itself, which employs approximately 695 employees. KEK's main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy physics, material science, structural biology, radiation science, computing science, nuclear transmutation and so on. Numerous experiments have been constructed at KEK by the internal and international collaborations that have made use of them. Makoto Kobayashi, emeritus professor at KEK, is known globally for his work on CP-violation, and was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. History KEK was established in 1997 in a reorganization of the Institute of Nuclear Study, the University of Tokyo (established in 1955), the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (established in 1971), and the Meson Science Laboratory of the University of Tokyo (established in 1988). However, the reorganization was not a simple merge of the aforementioned laboratories. As such, KEK was not the only new institute created at that time, because not all of the work of the parent institutions fell under the umbrella of high energy physics; for example, the Center for Nuclear Study, the University of Tokyo, was concurrently established for low energy nuclear physics in a research partnership with RIKEN. * 1971: National Laboratory for High Energy Physics (KEK) was established. * 1976: The proton synchrotron (PS) produced an 8 GeV beam as designed.

J-PARC was built with a collaboration between KEK and JAEA, and is used for nuclear physics, particle physics, muon science, neutron science, Accelerator- Driven System (ADS) and a range of other applications. * KEK digital accelerator (KEK-DA) is a renovation of the KEK 500 MeV booster proton synchrotron, which was shut down in 2006. The existing 40 MeV drift tube linac and rf cavities have been replaced by an electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source embedded in a 200 kV high-voltage terminal and induction acceleration cells, respectively. A DA is, in principle, capable of accelerating any species of ion in all possible charge states. = Shutdown complex = * Proton Synchrotron (PS): An accelerator complex to accelerate protons up to 12 GeV. PS had consisted primarily of a 750 keV pre-accelerator, a 40 MeV linac, a 500 MeV booster synchrotron and a 12 GeV main ring. PS had been used for nuclear and particle physics. PS also had provided the 12 GeV proton beam to a neutrino beam line in KEK for a KEK to Kamioka (K2K) experiment. PS achieved its design energy of 8 GeV in 1976. PS was shut down in 2007. * Neutrino Beam Line: A beam line to drive neutrinos into Super- Kamiokande, which is about 250 km away from KEK, and a neutrino oscillation experiment named K2K had been conducted from 1999 to 2004. A neutrino oscillation experiment named Tokai to Kamioka (T2K) has been conducted using J-PARC since 2009. * Transposable Ring Intersecting Storage Accelerator in Nippon (TRISTAN): An electron-positron collider had been operated from 1987 to 1995. The main purpose was detecting top quark. The electron and positron energy were 30 GeV. TRISTAN had three detectors: TOPAZ, VENUS and AMY. KEKB was built through the use of the tunnel of TRISTAN. = Running and future plans = * SuperKEKB: An electron-positron collider, consisting of a 7 GeV electron storage ring and a 4 GeV positron storage ring, to achieve higher luminosity by means of increasing the beam current, focusing the beams at the interaction point and making the electromagnetic beam-beam interactions small. The target luminosity has been set to 8√ó1035 cm‚àí2 s‚àí1, about 60 times higher than the KEKB's original design value. SuperKEKB has adopted a nano-beam scheme. KEK will build a new damping ring in order to generate the nano scale positron beam. On October, 2010 the Japanese government formally approved the SuperKEKB project, and on June, 2010 an initial budget of 100 million dollars (¬•100 = $1) for a Very Advanced Research Support Program was assigned for 2010-2012. The total budget is about 315 million dollars (¬•100 = $1) by the program. The upgrade will be completed, and the first collisions have been conducted in 2018. The highest luminosity will be achieved in 2021. Belle II experiment will be conducted using SuperKEKB. * Compact Energy Recovery Linac (cERL): A test accelerator for a future synchrotron light source named Energy Recovery Linac (ERL). cERL will study the uncertainty of the accelerator physics in the ERL through the beam experiments. The beam commissioning in cERL will be scheduled from 2013 with a 35 MeV electron beam. KEK has a plan that will build 5 GeV ERL, provides ultra-high brightness and ultra-short pulsed synchrotron light, after the cERL experiments. * International Linear Collider (ILC): A future electron-positron linear collider consisting of superconducting cavities with a length of approximately 31 kilometers in length and two damping rings, for electrons and positrons, with a circumference of 6.7 kilometers.

History =Founding and early years= Founded in 1899, Elizabethtown College is one of many higher learning institutions founded in the 19th century by churches or church members interested in the educational advancement of their denominational membership. The college was founded by interested members of the Church of the Brethren in response to an initiative by the Reverend Jacob G. Francis. Francis advocated for Elizabethtown because of the proximity to the railways (which holds true to this day as an Amtrak station is currently there). First classes for the new college were held on November 13, 1900, in the Heisey Building in downtown Elizabethtown. During its first two decades, the college operated as an academy, offering a limited curriculum centering on four-year teaching degrees and high school type classes. =1920‚Äì1950= In 1921, the Pennsylvania Department of Public Instruction accredited the College, and authorized its first baccalaureate degrees in arts and sciences.

He was Mayor of Jacksonville, Florida from 1949 to 1965, and served as the 35th Governor of Florida from 1965 to 1967. Early life Born in Chicago, Illinois, Haydon Burns' family moved to Jacksonville in 1922, where he attended Andrew Jackson High School before going on to attend Babson College in Massachusetts. Before the outbreak of World War II he was an appliance salesman and a flight school operator. During the war, he joined the U.S. Navy and was posted as a technical officer in the office of the Secretary of the Navy. Following the war, he returned to Jacksonville and began a public relations and business consulting firm and worked selling appliances. Mayor of Jacksonville In 1949 Burns, a segregationist, announced his intention to run for Mayor of Jacksonville against incumbent C. Frank Whitehead. He defeated Whitehead in the Democratic Party primary, and then faced Jacksonville businessman William Ashley, a Democrat running as a political independent, in the general election ‚Äì an unusual occurrence, as Democrats had been dominant in city politics for decades.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-J0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=jekFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1483,108683&dq;=frank- whitehead+burns&hl;=en On June 21, 1949, Burns defeated Ashley to become the mayor of Jacksonville.https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-Z0yAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=jekFAAAAIBAJ&pg;=4438,496149&dq;=haydon- burns+ashley&hl;=en Burns' first term was an abbreviated two-year stint; he was thereafter re-elected four times, the longest consecutive stint of any mayor in the city's history. During his time in the mayor's office, he oversaw massive growth in Jacksonville. He promoted the city around the world in an attempt to lure international investments and to get corporations to relocate offices to the city. He commissioned the production of a slide show called \\"The Jacksonville Story\\". Hundreds of audiences around the world saw it. The American National Exhibit showed a film version in the Soviet Union. Burns personally made presentations at The Hague and in Israel. He made \\"The Jacksonville Story\\" known from coast to coast, and so was Jacksonville's mayor. He was elected president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, president of the Florida League of Municipalities, and delegate to the International Congress of Municipalities. While mayor, he won tax breaks for insurance companies and Prudential Insurance relocated from New Jersey to a skyscraper in Jacksonville. Other insurance companies followed, and Jacksonville became known as the insurance capital of the South. A new courthouse and City Hall were built on the site of rotten wharves, and a long-promised Civic Auditorium was built on the banks of the St. John's River. Jacksonville Memorial Coliseum and Sam W. Wolfson Baseball Park made the city thoroughly modern. The Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, today CSX, moved from Wilmington, North Carolina, to the Jacksonville riverfront. The world's largest Sears Roebuck store opened on what once was skid row. A modern expressway system took shape and the city got the Jacksonville Suns baseball franchise and a hockey team. The city faced many problems during Burns' term. Burns was a segregationist running on his ability to control Jacksonville‚Äôs racial conflicts, Burns deputized even firefighters to strengthen the city‚Äôs police force to resist integration.Racial violence ignited on August 27, 1960, during a protest to integrate downtown lunch counters in the Hemming Park shopping area. Segregationists responded by attacking the protesters with baseball bats and ax handles; the day is remembered as Ax Handle Saturday. Burns tried to blame the shameful incident on visitors but the police chief attributed the attacks to locals. The city's police department was ridden with scandal and multiple grand jury indictments were handed down on public officials all around him. One of his final acts as mayor was his handling of the Hotel Roosevelt fire in downtown. Although 23 people died, many other hotel guests survived. In 1964 he announced he would be stepping down as mayor to run for Governor of Florida. City Commissioner Lou Ritter was appointed to take his place.Tschimpke, Glenn: ‚ÄúLou Ritter‚Äù Jax Daily Record, April 16, 2002 Governorship Burns defeated Republican Charles Holley in the November 3 general election to become Governor of Florida. He was sworn in on January 5, 1965, to serve an abbreviated two-year term. This short term came about because the cycle of gubernatorial elections was changed so as not to coincide with presidential election years. While in office, he oversaw progress in the development of a new state constitution, as well as new areas of outdoor recreation and industry. Also, Governor Burns opposed the death penalty and allowed no executions (the last pre-Furman execution in Florida took place in 1964).Michael Mello, Deathwork: Defending the Condemned, University of Minnesota Press, 2002, , Governor Burns is also remembered for participating in a news conference at the Cherry Plaza Hotel in Orlando on November 15, 1965, introducing Walt and Roy Disney to Florida as they announced that the state would be the location of their \\"East Coast Disneyland\\", Walt Disney World. The 1966 gubernatorial elections pitted the sitting governor against Robert King High, a popular Miami politician. This primary was significant because Burns represented the conservative wing of the Democratic Party and High was the choice of the liberals from South Florida. Governor Burns lost the 1966 Democratic primary and then did not support High in the general election. Political observers in Florida point to High's supposed failure to obtain such endorsement from Burns because of Burns's conservative views on civil rights. This left the party divided in the face of united Republican support for Claude Kirk. He left office on January 3, 1967, as the first Democratic Governor of Florida in history to be succeeded by a Republican since Reconstruction. Post-governorship Haydon Burns Library in 1968 After his term ended, the governor returned to private business consulting in Jacksonville. In 1971, he made an attempt to be reelected mayor, but he was defeated by incumbent Hans Tanzler in the Democratic primary. Many of the projects that he helped to create, such as the Civic Auditorium, rebuilt in 1996 and renamed the Times-Union Center for the Performing Arts, Wolfson Park, City Hall and the Jacksonville Coliseum, have all been replaced with newer structures. However, his work for the city's growth remains evident today. Haydon Burns remained in Jacksonville until his death in 1987. Jacksonville's main public library, built in 1965, was named the Haydon Burns Library in honor of the former mayor. It was designed by Taylor Hardwick, a local architect who designed many local structures built in Jacksonville. From 1965 to 2005 it was the main library of Jacksonville. In 2005 it was replaced by a new Main Library. In 1966, the building located at 605 Suwannee Street in Tallahassee, Florida, opened and was named the W. Haydon Burns Building. It became home to the State Road Department, now the Florida Department of Transportation. In 2004, the city of Jacksonville renamed the old City Hall, built by Burns, as the Haydon Burns City Hall Annex.

Shims may also be used as spacers to fill gaps between parts subject to wear.  Materials  Pre-cut metal shims, all with a thickness of 1.00 millimeters. Many materials make suitable shim stock (also often styled shimstock), or base material, depending on the context: wood, stone, plastic, metal, or even paper (e.g., when used under a table leg to level the table surface). High quality shim stock can be bought commercially, for example as laminated shims, but shims are often created ad hoc from whatever material is immediately available. Laminated shim stock is stacked foil that can be peeled off one layer at a time to adjust the thickness of the shim. Applications In automobiles, shims are commonly used to adjust the clearance or space between two parts. For example, shims are inserted into or under bucket tappets to control valve clearances. Clearance is adjusted by changing the thickness of the shim. In assembly and weld fixtures precision metal shims are used between two parts so that the final production parts are created within the product drawing's specified tolerances.

June 20, 1937) was a Soviet military figure and a statesman of Czech ethnicity.  Biography  Zof joined the revolutionary movement in 1910. Three years later he became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). During World War I, Zof worked as a fitter at an arms factory in Sestroretsk, where he was in charge of the Bolshevist underground. After the February Revolution in 1917, Zof led the Bolsheviks' organization in Sestroretsk and was a deputy of the Petrograd Soviet. In July 1917, he prepared fake identity papers for Vladimir Lenin and organized his move from Petrograd to Razliv at the request of the RSDLP Central Committee. Zof would then establish contact between Lenin and the Central Committee. In 1918-1919, he was appointed brigade and division commissar and supplies manager for the 3rd Army of the Eastern Front. In 1919-1920, Zof was a member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Baltic Fleet and a member of the Petrograd defense committee. In 1921-1924, he held a post of a commissar at the office of the commander-in-chief of the naval forces of the Republic. Between December 1924 and 1926, Zof was the commander of the naval forces and member of the Revolutionary Military Council of the USSR. In 1927-1929, he headed the Sovtorgflot (Soviet Commercial Fleet) office. In 1930-1931, Zof was a deputy People's Commissar of Railroad Transportation. In 1931, he was appointed first deputy People's Commissar of Water Transportation. Later Zof fell into disgrace and was appointed director of the \\"Kompresor\\" factory in Moscow. In 1937, he was arrested and sentenced to death by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on June 19 on accounts of being involved in an \\"anti-Soviet terrorist organisation\\". Zof was executed next day. He was posthumously rehabilitated in 1956.  Awards  * Order of the Red Banner.

Most of his works were written in English.  Biography  Born in Barcelona, Alfau emigrated to the United States with his family at the age of fourteen. He lived in the United States for the remainder of his life. Alfau earned a living as a translator. His sparse creation of fictional and poetic output remained obscure throughout most of his lifetime. Alfau wrote two novels in English: Locos: A Comedy of Gestures and Chromos. Locos -- a metafictive collection of related short stories set in Toledo and Madrid, involving several characters that defy the wishes of the author, write their own stories, and even assume each other's roles -- was published by Farrar & Rinehart in 1936. The novel, for which Alfau was paid $250, received some critical acclaim, but little popular attention. The novel was republished in 1987 after Steven Moore, then an editor for the small publisher Dalkey Archive Press, found the book at a barn sale in Massachusetts, read it, and contacted Alfau after a friend had found his telephone number in the Manhattan phone book.Steven Moore, \\"Recalled to Life,\\" Review of Contemporary Fiction (Spring 1993): 245‚Äì47. The novel's second edition was modestly successful, but Alfau refused payment, instructing the publisher to use the earnings from Locos to fund some other unpublished work. When Moore asked if he had written any other books, Alfau produced the manuscript for Chromos, which had been resting in a drawer since 1948. A comic story of Spanish immigrants to the United States contending with their two cultures, Chromos went on to be nominated for the National Book Award in 1990. Alfau also wrote a book of poetry in Spanish, Sentimental Songs (La poes√≠a cursi), written between 1923 and 1987 and published in a bilingual edition in 1992; and a book of children's stories, Old Tales from Spain, published in 1929. Locos, Chromos and Old Tales from Spain were translated into Spanish and published in Spain during the 1990s. Alfau's last years were spent in an octogenarian nursing home in New York, thanks to an indigent pension granted by the city council. Felipe Alfau died in New York in 1999. Dawn Powell knew him in the late 1930s and described him thus in her diaries: > Felipe Alfau, brilliant, dazzling mind, witty, Jesuitical, a mental > performance similar only to Cummings, but a scholar‚Äîerudite, fascinating, > above all a romantic about his Spain, fiercely patriotic, a figure out of a > medieval romance, a lover of Toledo, of old Spain, valuable surely to his > country‚Äîtalked so brilliantly of Totalitarianism that is based on human > weakness, human error, human conduct, that it almost convinced me.The > Diaries of Dawn Powell, 1931‚Äì1965, ed.

The primary members of the band are Spencer Seim on electric guitar and Zach Hill on drums. In 2005, the band expanded their live band by adding Dan Elkan on vocals, rhythm guitar, sampler and synthesizer and Jonathan Hischke on synth bass guitar for their Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard tour. In 2006 they reformed as a five-piece line-up including Seim, Hill, Carson McWhirter (of The Advantage), Aaron Ross & Josh Hill. In 2009, the band was reduced back to core members Hill and Seim. History =Formation and early years= As teenagers Spencer Seim and Zach Hill were both members of the Northern California band Legs on Earth along with Josh Hill on guitar and Julian Imsdahl on bass and vocals. The band achieved some moderate local success, becoming renowned for their wild live shows, young age, and Primus-esque sound. The band sounded similar to Primus, especially the vocals and bass but Zach Hill described it in an interview as pop music but like Devo and Talking Heads. They released one album in 1999 called Lasers & Saviors on local record label Para-Sight Records, now out of print. In April of 2000 they went on hiatus and later broke up. Imsdahl later joined the band Grandstream (formerly known as Little California), and was previously in the band Eraserhead. Hill and Seim decided they wanted to continue playing together and pursue a less mainstream sound. According to Hill, they didn't always intend to remain a duo, though: \\"[We] had intentions to start a band that was like‚Ä¶ kinda like what we were doing with just the two of us, but with more people. But, we couldn't find the other people so we decided to do it just with the two of us.\\" Their name is simply a reference to the slang word \\"hella\\" that was common throughout Northern California. Hella's earliest recording was the self-released Leather Diamond EP, hand-assembled in a nondescript cardboard sleeve and sold at some of their first shows. On March 19, 2002, they debuted proper with the full-length Hold Your Horse Is LP on 5 Rue Christine (a subsidiary of Olympia, Washington-based Kill Rock Stars). The Falam Dynasty 7\\" was also released that year. =2003‚Äîpresent= After the release of Hold Your Horse Is, 2003 saw Hella begin to deviate from the basic framework in the studio, although their live sound remained largely unchanged. Released on June 17 of that year, Hella's Bitches Ain't Shit But Good People EP (originally a vinyl only release) featured many firsts for the band. An earlier recorded (Leather Diamond) version of a song from their first LP, \\"Republic of Rough And Ready\\", became their first widely released song to feature vocals (provided by friend of the band Dan Elkan). A version of \\"1-800-Ghost-Dance\\" with vocals by Elkan was available as a downloadable mp3 on the band's website in late 2002. The Bitches EP also found Hella using bass guitar, synthesizer, and drum machine for the first time. Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass, also an EP, was released on August 26 and featured the use of synth, sampler, and drum machine and an apparent influence from 8-bit video game music, first hinted at on the opening track of Hold Your Horse Is, \\"The D. Elkan\\". Hella rounded out the year with a split live double CD with San Francisco, California-based band Dilute. Hella released their second full-length LP in 2004, The Devil Isn't Red. Other releases for the year included a split 7\\" (with Four Tet) and a limited edition, Japan-only release of the three-song Acoustics EP. For their 2005 release, Hella again experimented with their sound in the studio. Church Gone Wild/Chirpin Hard, released through Suicide Squeeze Records, is a double- solo album, with Zach Hill and Seim each recording a whole disc's worth of material independent of each other. Hill's disc, Church Gone Wild, is a 56-minute noise piece which featured Zach doing all the vocals and instruments, save for a few guest appearances; while Seim's disc, Chirpin Hard, again experiments with the fusion of 8-bit Nintendo music with punk and math rock. Hella also expanded their live band to a quartet in 2005, adding Dan Elkan on vocals, rhythm guitar, and synthesizer, and Jonathan Hischke on bass guitar in order to play songs from Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass and Church Gone Wild/Chirpin Hard live, in most cases for the first time. This line-up toured the US in support of Out Hud in Spring, System of a Down, The Mars Volta, Les Claypool, and Dillinger Escape Plan in the fall as well as numerous headlining dates in the U.S. as well as visits to Japan, Spain and the UK. A DVD/CD EP release titled Concentration Face/Homeboy was released on November 8, 2005 on 5RC Records. In 2006, Hella consisted of Spencer Seim, Zach Hill, Hill's cousin Josh (who also played in Legs on Earth), Seim's Advantage bandmate Carson McWhirter, and Aaron Ross. The first release from this line-up, entitled There's No 666 in Outer Space, was released on January 30, 2007 on Ipecac Recordings. This album was released in 2008 as a double 180g vinyl on Black Diamond Records with new artwork by Mayka Finkelstein- Amrami. As of August 2008, In an interview with Exclaim Magazine regarding his solo effort, Zach stated that \\"Hella is a real grey area in general right now\\". The future of the band seemed to be up in the air. On Thursday, March 12, 2009, a blog post on Hella's MySpace page revealed that Hella once again consisted of only core members Hill and Seim, and that the band was working on writing and recording a new album, due to be finished later that year. It also revealed that an international tour may have been in the works. On September 4, 2010, Hella announced they had eight tracks ready for their new album. As of 2011, Hella is signed to Sargent House, who released their most recent album, Tripper, on August 30, 2011. As of 2020, little to no information has surfaced about new Hella projects. The band is considered by some to be in indefinite hiatus. Side projects In addition to their work in Hella, Seim and Zach Hill have also recorded with a number of side projects. Seim plays drums in NES theme music cover band The Advantage (a reference to the NES Advantage controller), notable for using only guitar, bass guitar, and drums to replicate the 8-bit programmed music of the games. The genre has been called Nintendocore and The Advantage are credited with pioneering it. Seim has also released a solo album under the moniker sBACH. Recently Seim, playing drums, has formed Solos with guitarist and vocalist Aaron Ross (formerly of Hella). Their debut album \\"Beast of Both Worlds\\" was released on Sept 11 2012 on Joyful Noise records. Hill has recorded albums with Marnie Stern, Tough Guy Fantasy/Arctic Boys, Fl√∂ssin, Crime in Choir, Nervous Cop (with drummer Greg Saunier of Deerhoof and harpist Joanna Newsom), Damsel (with guitarist Nels Cline), Friend/Enemy (with Tim Kinsella, Sam Zurick, Todd Mattei, Jim Becker, Graeme Gibson, Caryn Culp, Emma Grace Lansangan, Nick Marci, Chris Powell, Azita Youssefi), Zach Hill and the Holy Smokes (whose first release was accompanied by a 138-page book written and illustrated by Hill), as well as playing drums for Chino Moreno's band Team Sleep, The Ladies, Kenseth Thibideau and Marty Anderson's band Howard Hello and Jeordie White and Chris Goss's band Goon Moon. More recently, Hill has teamed up with Mick Barr from Octis and Orthrelm and together have released the LPs Shred Earthship on 5 Rue Christine and Volume 2 on the Austrian label Rock Is Hell. Volume 2 consists of the two longest tracks from the Shred Earthship sessions. Hill's best known project outside of Hella now is perhaps experimental hip hop outfit Death Grips, who have gone on to achieve a cult following of their own right and widespread critical acclaim. Both Hill and Hischke are members of El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez with Juan Alderete, Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodr√≠guez-L√≥pez, the first of three records produced by the group is Cryptomnesia, which was released on May 5, 2009. In 2008, Hischke formed the band Dot Hacker along with Josh Klinghoffer. The song \\"Biblical Violence\\" is featured on episode 24 of the Welcome to Night Vale podcast.

In addition to many scientific papers, his books include The Snakes of Australia, A Catalogue of the Minerals and Rocks in the Australian Museum and A Short Guide to the Australian Fossil Remains in the Australian Museum. He published the scientific description of the Queensland Lungfish, considered a \\"living fossil\\". Career Krefft was born in the Duchy of Brunswick (now part of Germany) the son of William Krefft, confectioner, and his wife Johanna, n√©e Buschhoff.Whitley, G.P.; Rutledge, Martha (1974). \\"Krefft, Johann Ludwig Gerard (Louis) (1830 - 1881)\\". Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 5. Melbourne: Melbourne University Press. pp. 42-44. Retrieved 5 Sep 2009 He was educated at St Martin's College, Brunswick, and as a youth was interested in art and wished to study painting. He was, however, placed in a mercantile house and about 1850 emigrated to New York City. Krefft arrived in Australia in November 1852 and worked in the Victorian goldfields for some years. A talented artist and draughtsman, Krefft was hired to help sketch and collect specimens for the National Museum of Victoria on William Blandowski's explorations on the Murray River and Darling River in 1856‚Äì1857, and in 1858 he was appointed to the National Museum to catalogue the specimens collected on the expedition. Krefft visited Germany in 1858 following the death of his father. In 1858 Krefft also showed examples of his drawings at the Victoria Industrial Society Exhibition. Krefft arrived in Sydney, New South Wales in 1860 and was appointed Assistant Curator of the Australian Museum on the recommendation of Governor Sir William Denison. In 1864 he was appointed Director. During his time at the Australian Museum, Krefft maintained a relationship with the Melbourne Museum, and corresponded and exchanged specimens with Frederick McCoy, the Director of that institution. In 1864 he published a Catalogue of Mammalia in the Collection of the Australian Museum, and in 1865, as a pamphlet, Two Papers on the Vertebrata of the Lower Murray and Darling and on the Snakes of Sydney. These papers had been read before the Philosophical Society of New South Wales and, though the title did not show it, a third paper on the Aborigines of the Lower Murray and Darling was included in the publication. In 1869 Krefft's The Snakes of Australia was published, which is the first definitive work on this group of Australian animals. Unable to find a publisher, Krefft eventually financed the publication himself, and it was published by the Government Printer. Krefft and his publication were lauded at the Sydney Intercolonial Exhibition of 1870, and Helena Scott and Harriet Scott received a Very High Commendation for the striking artwork that accompanied Krefft's text. In 1871 Krefft authored The Mammals of Australia, which also included plates by the Scott sisters, Helena and Harriet. His Catalogue of the Minerals and Rocks in the Collection of the Australian Museum was published in 1873. Krefft with a reef manta ray, a species he described in 1868 Krefft was fired in 1874. He was carried in his chair to the door of the Museum and thrown into the street. He had fallen foul of the Trustees, William John Macleay in particular, because he had accused them of using the museum's resources to augment private collections. They responded by accusing him of drunkenness, falsifying attendance records and even allowing the sale of dirty postcards. He subsequently brought an action against one of the trustees and obtained a verdict for ¬£250. The judge held that Krefft was a superior officer under government, and that no one had power to remove him but the governor with the advice of the executive council. Subsequently, parliament passed a vote of ¬£1000 to be applied in satisfaction of Krefft's claims. In 1877 he began the publication of Krefft's Nature in Australia, a popular journal for the discussion of questions of natural history, but it quickly ceased publication. Krefft died on 19 February 1881 from congestion of the lungs, he was buried in the churchyard of St Jude's Church of England, Randwick. He was survived by his wife Annie, n√©e McPhail, whom he had married on 6 February 1869, and two sons. Krefft was one of the very few supporters of Darwinism in Australia during 1870s. He became a correspondent of Charles Darwin and they exchanged supportive letters.Mozley, Ann (1967). \\"Evolution and the Climate of Opinion in Australia, 1840-76\\". Victorian Studies 10 (4): 411‚Äì430. Krefft was a member of many scientific societies, and contributed papers to the Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London and other scientific and popular journals. Some of these were printed separately as pamphlets. Legacy Krefft is honored in the scientific names of two reptiles endemic to Australia: Cacophis krefftii, a species of venomous snake; and Emydura macquarii krefftii, a subspecies of freshwater turtle.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Krefft\\", p. 146). The mountain group of Krefftberget at Barents√∏ya, Svalbard, is named after him.

It was invented in 1874 by Herbert McLeod (1841‚Äì1923). McLeod gauges were once commonly found attached to equipment that operates under vacuum, such as a lyophilizer. Today, however, these gauges have largely been replaced by electronic vacuum gauges. The design of a McLeod gauge is somewhat similar to that of a mercury-column manometer. Typically it is filled with mercury. If used incorrectly, this mercury can escape and contaminate the vacuum system attached to the gauge. ISO 3753-1977 (E) McLeod gauges operate by taking in a sample volume of gas from a vacuum chamber, then compressing it by tilting and infilling with mercury. The pressure in this smaller volume is then measured by a mercury manometer, and knowing the compression ratio (the ratio of the initial and final volumes), the pressure of the original vacuum can be determined by applying Boyle's law. This method is fairly accurate for non- condensable gases, such as oxygen and nitrogen. However, condensable gases, such as water vapour, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and pump-oil vapors may be in gaseous form in the low pressure of the vacuum chamber, but will condense when compressed by the McLeod gauge. The result is an erroneous reading, showing a pressure much lower than actually present. A cold trap may be used in conjunction with a McLeod gauge to condense these vapors before they enter the gauge. The McLeod gauge has the advantage that its calibration is nearly the same for all non-condensable gases. The device can be manually operated and the scale read visually, or the process can be automated in various ways. For example, a small electric motor can periodically rotate the assembly to collect a gas sample. If a fine platinum wire is in the capillary tube, its resistance indicates the height of the mercury column around it. Modern electronic vacuum gauges are simpler to use, less fragile, and do not present a mercury hazard, but their reading is highly dependent on the chemical nature of the gas being measured, and their calibration is unstable. For this reason, McLeod gauges continue to be used as a calibration standard for electronic gauges.

BPM is typically performed by business analysts, who provide expertise in the modeling discipline; by subject matter experts, who have specialized knowledge of the processes being modeled; or more commonly by a team comprising both. Alternatively, the process model can be derived directly from events' logs using process mining tools. The business objective is often to increase process speed or reduce cycle time; to increase quality; or to reduce costs, such as labor, materials, scrap, or capital costs. In practice, a management decision to invest in business process modeling is often motivated by the need to document requirements for an information technology project. Change management programs are typically involved to put any improved business processes into practice. With advances in software design, the vision of BPM models becoming fully executable (and capable of simulations and round-trip engineering) is coming closer to reality.  History  Techniques to model business process such as the flow chart, functional flow block diagram, control flow diagram, Gantt chart, PERT diagram, and IDEF have emerged since the beginning of the 20th century. The Gantt charts were among the first to arrive around 1899, the flow charts in the 1920s, Functional Flow Block Diagram and PERT in the 1950s, Data Flow Diagrams and IDEF in the 1970s. Among the modern methods are Unified Modeling Language and Business Process Model and Notation. Still, these represent just a fraction of the methodologies used over the years to document business processes.Thomas Dufresne & James Martin (2003). \\"Process Modeling for E-Business\\". INFS 770 Methods for Information Systems Engineering: Knowledge Management and E-Business. Spring 2003 The term 'business process modeling' was coined in the 1960s in the field of systems engineering by S. Williams in his 1967 article 'Business Process Modelling Improves Administrative Control'.Williams, S. (1967) \\"Business Process Modeling Improves Administrative Control,\\" In: Automation. December, 1967, pp. 44 - 50. His idea was that techniques for obtaining a better understanding of physical control systems could be used in a similar way for business processes. It was not until the 1990s that the term became popular. In the 1990s the term 'process' became a new productivity paradigm.Asbj√∏rn Rolstad√•s (1995). \\"Business process modeling and re-engineering\\". in: Performance Management: A Business Process Benchmarking Approach. p. 148-150. Companies were encouraged to think in processes instead of functions and procedures. Process thinking looks at the chain of events in the company from purchase to supply, from order retrieval to sales, etc. The traditional modeling tools were developed to illustrate time and cost, while modern tools focus on cross-functional activities. These cross-functional activities have increased significantly in number and importance, due to the growth of complexity and dependence. New methodologies include business process redesign, business process innovation, business process management, integrated business planning, among others, all \\"aiming at improving processes across the traditional functions that comprise a company\\". In the field of software engineering, the term 'business process modeling' opposed the common software process modeling, aiming to focus more on the state of the practice during software development.Brian C. Warboys (1994). Software Process Technology: Third European Workshop EWSPT'94, Villard de Lans, France, February 7‚Äì9, 1994: Proceedings. p. 252. In that time (the early 1990s) all existing and new modeling techniques to illustrate business processes were consolidated as 'business process modeling languages'. In the Object Oriented approach, it was considered to be an essential step in the specification of business application systems. Business process modeling became the base of new methodologies, for instance, those that supported data collection, data flow analysis, process flow diagrams, and reporting facilities. Around 1995, the first visually oriented tools for business process modeling and implementation were being presented.  Topics  = Business model = A business model is a framework for creating economic, social, and/or other forms of value. The term 'business model' is thus used for a broad range of informal and formal descriptions to represent core aspects of a business, including purpose, offerings, strategies, infrastructure, organizational structures, trading practices, and operational processes and policies. In the most basic sense, a business model is a method of doing business by which a company can sustain itself. That is, generate revenue. The business model spells-out how a company makes money by specifying where it is positioned in the value chain. = Business process = A business process is a collection of related, structured activities or tasks that produce a specific service or product (serve a particular goal) for a particular customer or customers. There are three main types of business processes: # Management processes, that govern the operation of a system. Typical management processes include corporate governance and strategic management. # Operational processes, that constitute the core business and create the primary value stream. Typical operational processes are purchasing, manufacturing, marketing, and sales. # Supporting processes, that support the core processes. Examples include accounting, recruitment, and technical support. A business process can be decomposed into several sub-processes, which have their own attributes but also contribute to achieving the goal of the super-process. The analysis of business processes typically includes the mapping of processes and sub-processes down to activity level. A business process model is a model of one or more business processes and defines the ways in which operations are carried out to accomplish the intended objectives of an organization. Such a model remains an abstraction and depends on the intended use of the model. It can describe the workflow or the integration between business processes. It can be constructed in multiple levels. A workflow is a depiction of a sequence of operations, declared as work of a person, of a simple or complex mechanism, of a group of persons,See e.g., ISO 12052:2006 of an organization of staff, or of machines. The workflow may be seen as any abstraction of real work, segregated into workshare, work split or other types of ordering. For control purposes, the workflow may be a view of real work under a chosen aspect. = Artifact-centric business process = The artifact-centric business process model has emerged as a holistic approach for modeling business processes, as it provides a highly flexible solution to capture operational specifications of business processes. It particularly focuses on describing the data of business processes, known as \\"artifacts\\", by characterizing business-relevant data objects, their life-cycles, and related services. The artifact-centric process modelling approach fosters the automation of the business operations and supports the flexibility of the workflow enactment and evolution.  Tools  Business process modelling tools provide business users with the ability to model their business processes, implement and execute those models, and refine the models based on as-executed data. As a result, business process modelling tools can provide transparency into business processes, as well as the centralization of corporate business process models and execution metrics.Workflow/Business Process Management (BPM) Service Pattern June 27, 2007. Accessed 29 nov 2008. Modelling tools may also enable collaborate modelling of complex processes by users working in teams, where users can share and simulate models collaboratively.Christensen, Lars Rune & Thomas Hildebrandt (2017) Modelling Cooperative Work at a Medical Department. Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Communities and Technologies. Troyes, France. ACM. Business process modelling tools should not be confused with business process automation systems - both practices have modeling the process as the same initial step and the difference is that process automation gives you an ‚Äòexecutable diagram‚Äô and that is drastically different from traditional graphical business process modelling tools. = Modelling and simulation = Modelling and simulation functionality allows for pre-execution \\"what-if\\" modelling and simulation. Post-execution optimization is available based on the analysis of actual as-performed metrics. * Use case diagrams created by Ivar Jacobson, 1992 (integrated in UML) * Activity diagrams (also adopted by UML) Some business process modelling techniques are: * Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) * Life-cycle Modelling Language (LML) * Subject-oriented business process management (S-BPM) * Cognition enhanced Natural language Information Analysis Method (CogNIAM) * Extended Business Modelling Language (xBML) * Event-driven process chain (EPC) * ICAM DEFinition (IDEF0) * Unified Modelling Language (UML), extensions for business process * Formalized Administrative Notation (FAN) * Harbarian process modeling (HPM) = Programming language tools = BPM suite software provides programming interfaces (web services, application program interfaces (APIs)) which allow enterprise applications to be built to leverage the BPM engine. This component is often referenced as the engine of the BPM suite. Programming languages that are being introduced for BPM include: * Business Process Execution Language (BPEL), * Web Services Choreography Description Language (WS-CDL). * XML Process Definition Language (XPDL), Some vendor-specific languages: * Architecture of Integrated Information Systems (ARIS) supports EPC, * Java Process Definition Language (JBPM), Other technologies related to business process modelling include model-driven architecture and service- oriented architecture.  See also  = Business reference model = Example of the US Federal Government Business Reference ModelFEA (2005) FEA Records Management Profile, Version 1.0. December 15, 2005. A business reference model is a reference model, concentrating on the functional and organizational aspects of an enterprise, service organization or government agency. In general a reference model is a model of something that embodies the basic goal or idea of something and can then be looked at as a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the business operations of an organization, independent of the organizational structure that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict the relationship between the business processes, business functions, and the business area's business reference model. These reference models can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance. The most familiar business reference model is the Business Reference Model of the US federal government. That model is a function-driven framework for describing the business operations of the federal government independent of the agencies that perform them. The Business Reference Model provides an organized, hierarchical construct for describing the day-to-day business operations of the federal government. While many models exist for describing organizations ‚Äì organizational charts, location maps, etc. ‚Äì this model presents the business using a functionally driven approach.FEA Consolidated Reference Model Document . Oct 2007. = Business process integration = Example of the interaction between business process and data models A business model, which may be considered an elaboration of a business process model, typically shows business data and business organizations as well as business processes. By showing business processes and their information flows, a business model allows business stakeholders to define, understand, and validate their business enterprise. The data model part of the business model shows how business information is stored, which is useful for developing software code. See the figure on the right for an example of the interaction between business process models and data models.Paul R. Smith & Richard Sarfaty (1993). Creating a strategic plan for configuration management using Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools. Paper For 1993 National DOE/Contractors and Facilities CAD/CAE User's Group. Usually a business model is created after conducting an interview, which is part of the business analysis process. The interview consists of a facilitator asking a series of questions to extract information about the subject business process. The interviewer is referred to as a facilitator to emphasize that it is the participants, not the facilitator, who provide the business process information. Although the facilitator should have some knowledge of the subject business process, but this is not as important as the mastery of a pragmatic and rigorous method interviewing business experts. The method is important because for most enterprises a team of facilitators is needed to collect information across the enterprise, and the findings of all the interviewers must be compiled and integrated once completed. Business models are developed as defining either the current state of the process, in which case the final product is called the \\"as is\\" snapshot model, or a concept of what the process should become, resulting in a \\"to be\\" model. By comparing and contrasting \\"as is\\" and \\"to be\\" models the business analysts can determine if the existing business processes and information systems are sound and only need minor modifications, or if reengineering is required to correct problems or improve efficiency. Consequently, business process modeling and subsequent analysis can be used to fundamentally reshape the way an enterprise conducts its operations. = Business process re-engineering = Business Process Re-engineering Cycle Business process reengineering (BPR) aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the processes that exist within and across organizations. It examines business processes from a \\"clean slate\\" perspective to determine how best to construct them. Business process re-engineering (BPR) began as a private sector technique to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the development and deployment of sophisticated information systems and networks. Leading organizations use this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide , United States General Accounting Office, May 1997. = Business process management = Business process management is a field of management focused on aligning organizations with the wants and needs of clients. It is a holistic management approach that promotes business effectiveness and efficiency while striving for innovation, flexibility and integration with technology. As organizations strive for attainment of their objectives, business process management attempts to continuously improve processes - the process to define, measure and improve your processes ‚Äì a \\"process optimization\\" process.

Personal life  Jacques was born in Rockville, Maryland, and was later adopted.http://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=648 He has a younger brother named Justin. Jacques lived near Northampton, Massachusetts, where Questionable Content is set; in 2015, he moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia. Jacques graduated from Hampshire College with a degree in music. He was married to his business manager Cristi until their amicable separation in 2014. In 2017, Jacques travelled to France and got married. Questionable Content Questionable Content (QC) is a comedic slice-of-life webcomic that Jacques started on August 1, 2003. It was initially published two days a week, and then moved up to three updates a week when Jacques published strip #16. On September 4, 2004, Jacques lost his day job, and decided to try publishing QC every weekday and make a living selling QC-related T-shirts. Other artistic endeavors Jacques was a member of Dayfree Press, an online webcomic syndicate which included other artists such as Christian Fundin and Pontus Madsen of Little Gamers, Sam Logan of Sam and Fuzzy, and Ryan North of Dinosaur Comics. Jacques launched indietits as an anonymous side project on April 1, 2005, to use ideas that did not fit into Questionable Content setting. Compared to Questionable Content, it is a simple strip, eschewing detailed art and linear storyline in favour of reusable pre-drawn panels and one-shot jokes. To further broaden his drawing limits, Jacques created Jephdraw to place unnamed drawings of his onto the Internet. He puts anything from favored panels to simple sketches for others to see what he does in his spare time. In September 2014, Jacques launched a new comic, Alice Grove, which updated once per week until the story finished in July 2017. Early in 2015 Jacques purchased the domain name walmart.horse (using the more recently available ICANN-era generic top-level domains). The website's sole page is an image of a horse in front of a Walmart store. Jacques created the website as a piece of postmodernist \\"nonsense-art\\". In March Jacques posted a cease and desist letter he received from Walmart who claimed the website diluted their intellectual property. Although Jacques said he believes the site to be fair use, he said he would be willing to post a disclaimer on the site indicating that it is parody if Walmart requested it. Jacques gave up the domain after Walmart filed a domain dispute. In October 2015, Jacques launched a new strip titled Derelict Orbital Reflector Devices at the URL \\"dord.horse\\".https://questionablecontent.net/view.php?comic=3069 The strip revolves around a pair of sentient solar collection satellites (known as \\"DORDs\\"), part of a network of 2 similar satellites that were placed around the Sun to gather energy for a civilization that has long since departed, leaving the DORDs to contemplate their purpose and while away vast stretches of idle time. Each strip consists of a centrally-placed white sun disk on a black starfield, with the two DORDs (shaped like the letter \\"H\\" in a highly bolded font, with two thick side panels connected by a narrow body) assuming various positions in front of the sun, and text balloons for either or both of them in most panels. DORD updated on a daily basis, but no strips have been published since November 19, 2015. The domain registration for \\"dord.horse\\" expired. =Deathm√∏le= In 2005 Jacques launched Deathm√∏le, a virtual post- metal band whose works are available online. The band is currently composed of three characters from his comic, Questionable Content. The name for the band appears in Strip 554 for the first time.See also Since its inception, Jacques has periodically released individual Deathm√∏le songs through his LiveJournal or his Tumblr where they remain available; newer albums have been released on BandCamp. Jacques states that Deathm√∏le's style \\"...started out as a joke- I wanted to write and record a really stupid metal song ... and it turned out to be really fun. So fun, in fact, that I started writing more 'serious' metal tracks, and that‚Äôs ... how the music evolved.\\" In chronological order, the Deathm√∏le albums are Moletopopolis, Long Songs, ???, Trial Period (EP), Amps, Absent Gods & Creatures Foul, Fear of Black Horses, Meade's Army, Advances, Permanence (ongoing) and finally Jephm√∏le (ongoing). Each album typically has seven or eight tracks with Trial Period's three and Moletopopolis' fifteen being the extremes. The music is Jacques' original work, with the exception of a cover of Low's \\"Two-step\\" on Long Songs. On August 11, 2013, Jacques launched a Kickstarter project with a goal of $9,500 to professionally record the Deathm√∏le album Permanence.

It was once found throughout New Zealand, but when it came to the attention of scientists in 1894, its last refuge was Stephens Island in Cook Strait. Often claimed to be a species driven extinct by a single creature (a lighthouse keeper's cat named Tibbles), the wren in fact fell victim to the island's numerous feral cats.https://www.amusingplanet.com/2018/07/how-single- cat-hunted-to-extinction.html#modal-one The wren was described almost simultaneously by both Walter Rothschild and Walter Buller. It became extinct shortly after. Taxonomy The bird's scientific name commemorates the assistant lighthouse keeper, David Lyall, who first brought the bird to the attention of science. It was described as a distinct genus, Traversia, in honour of naturalist and curio dealer Henry H. Travers, who procured many specimens from Lyall. Traversia is a member of the family Acanthisittidae, or the New Zealand wrens ‚Äì which are not wrens but a similar-looking lineage of passerines,del Hoyo, J. Elliott, A. & Christie, D. (2004) Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 9: Cotingas to Pipits and Wagtails. Lynx Edicions. . originating in the Oligocene, and the sister group to all other songbirds. DNA analysis has confirmed that T. lyalli, the only member of its genus, is the oldest and most distinct lineage in the Acanthisittidae.  Description  Lyall's wren had olive-brown plumage with a yellow stripe through the eye. Its underside was grey in females and brownish-yellow in males and its body feathers were edged with brown. Most distinctively, Lyall's wren was flightless, with a reduced keel on its breastbone and short rounded wings. It is the best known of the four flightless passerines (songbirds) known to science,Millener, P.R. (1989) The only flightless passerine: the Stephens Island Wren (Traversia lyalli: Acanthisittidae). Notornis 36(#4): 280‚Äì284. all of which were inhabitants of islands and are now extinct. The others were two other New Zealand wrens (the long-billed wren and the stout-legged wren) and the long-legged bunting from Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands, all of which were only recently discovered as fossils and became extinct in prehistoric times. Living Lyall's wrens were seen only twice. The lighthouse keeper described the 'rock wren', as he called it, as almost nocturnal, \\"running around the rocks like a mouse and so quick in its movements that he could not get near enough to hit it with a stick or stone\\". Distribution Stephens Island as seen from D'Urville Island Historically, Lyall's wren was found only on Stephens Island. Prehistorically, it had been widespread throughout New Zealand before the land was settled by the MƒÅori.Millener, P.R. (1988) \\"Contributions to New Zealand's Late Quaternary avifauna I: Pachyplichas, a new genus of wren (Aves: Acanthisittidae), with two new species.\\" Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand 18(#4): 383‚Äì406 Its bones can be found in caves and deposits left by laughing owls on both main islands. Its disappearance from the mainland was probably due to predation by the Polynesian rat or kiore (Rattus exulans), which had been introduced by the MƒÅori. The presence of a flightless bird on an island 3.2 km from the mainland, along with Hamilton's frog (Leiopelma hamiltoni), which can be killed by exposure to salt water, may seem puzzling, but Stephens Island was connected to the rest of New Zealand during the last glaciation when sea levels were lower. Extinction Lyall's wrens by John Gerrard Keulemans 1905 illustration of a female and male, by Keulemans Much of what is commonly assumed to be established knowledge about this species' extinction is either wrong or has been misinterpreted, starting with the account by Rothschild (1905) who claimed that a single cat had killed all of the birds.Rothschild, W. (1905) \\"On extinct and vanishing birds\\". Proceedings of the 4th International Ornithological Congress, London: 191‚Äì217. The research of Galbreath and Brown (2004) and Medway (2004) has uncovered much of the actual history of the bird during the short time that it was known to researchers.Galbreath, R. & Brown, D. (2004) The tale of the lighthouse- keeper's cat: Discovery and extinction of the Stephens Island wren (Traversia lyalli). Notornis, 51(#4): 193‚Äì200. http://notornis.osnz.org.nz/system/files/Notornis_51_4_193.pdf * 1879 ** Early June?: A track to the site of the proposed lighthouse site is cleared, starting the period of human activity on the island. * 1881 ** 22 February: Marine Engineer John R. Blackett surveys the site for the proposed lighthouse. * 1891 ** April: Preparations for the construction of the lighthouse are begun by starting to build a tramway and a landing site for boats. * 1892 ** April: Clearance of land for the lighthouse and the associated farm begins (three lighthouse keepers and their families, 17 people in total, would eventually be living on the island). The first report of the species was a note on the island's birdlife made by the construction worker F. W. Ingram, which mentions \\"two kinds of wren\\" (the other one was probably the rifleman). * 1894 ** 29 January: The lighthouse commences working. ** 17‚Äì20 February?: This is a likely date for introduction of cats to Stephens Island. What can be said with any certainty is that at some time in early 1894, a pregnant cat brought to the island escaped. ** June?: A cat starts to bring carcasses of a species of small bird to the lighthouse keepers' housings. Lyall, who was interested in natural history, has one taken to Walter Buller by A. W. Bethune, second engineer on the government steamboat NZGSS Hinemoa. ** Before 25 July?: The specimen reaches Buller, who at once recognises it as distinct species and prepares a scientific description, to be published in the journal Ibis. Bethune lends Buller the specimen so it can be sent to London for the famed artist John Gerrard Keulemans to make a lithograph plate to accompany the description. ** Winter ‚Äì early spring (Southern Hemisphere): Lyall finds several more specimens. He tells Buller about two more (but does not send them to him), and sells nine to Travers. ** 9 October: Travers, who recognizes the commercial value of the birds, sidelines Buller and offers the birds to Walter Rothschild, who was wealthier and thus more likely to pay a high price, further piqueing Rothschild's interest by writing, \\"in a short time there will be [no \\"wrens\\"] left\\". Rothschild acquires his nine specimens. ** 11/12 October: Edward Lukins makes a list of birds on Stephens Island; he apparently confuses the species with the South Island rockwren. ** 19 December: Rothschild has quickly prepared a description of the bird, as Traversia lyalli, which is read by Ernst Hartert at the British Ornithologists' Club meeting. Philip Sclater, the Club's president and editor of the Ibis who knows of Buller's article in preparation, brings up the matter to Hartert, who says he cannot withdraw Rothschild's description without consent. ** 29 December: Rothschild's descriptionRothschild, Walter (1894): A new species from Stephens Island. Bull. B. O. C. 4(#22): 10. appears in the Bulletin of the British Ornithologists' Club. * 1895 ** 24 January: Travers offers Rothschild a specimen preserved in alcohol (with viscera intact) for ¬£5 (about ¬£415 in 2002's money: U.K. House of Commons Library, 2003). Rothschild apparently agrees, but never receives the bird. ** 4‚Äì9 February: Travers and three assistants searched the island for the bird, but found none. ** Before 11 February?: Lyall writes to Buller: \\"...the cats have become wild and are making sad havoc among all the birds.\\" ** 7 March: Travers supplies Rothschild with some details of the bird's habits. To his knowledge, the species had only been seen alive twice until then. He has only been able to procure one additional specimen, brought in by the cat as the bird was dying, which also had been preserved in alcohol. ** 16 March: The Christchurch newspaper The Press writes in an editorial: > \\"there is very good reason to believe that the bird is no longer to be found > on the island, and, as it is not known to exist anywhere else, it has > apparently become quite extinct. This is probably a record performance in > the way of extermination.\\" ** April: Buller's description of Xenicus insularis appears in the Ibis. The name is immediately reduced to a junior synonym. In the same issue, Rothschild's description is reprinted,Rothschild, Walter (1895): Notes on Xenicus lyalli. Ibis 7(#1): 268‚Äì269. with some additional remarks on the bird's apparent flightlessness. The race to describe the bird sparks much animosity between the two men and Buller never forgives Rothschild for beating him to it; for details and quotes, see Fuller (2000). ** August: In a paper for the Wellington Philosophical Society, Buller speaks of a female bird he recently had examined. He later purchases this specimen. ** 28 November: Travers informs Hartert that Lyall was not able to find more specimens during the winter and he believes the bird to be extinct. He offers two alcohol specimens for sale, for the price of ¬£50 apiece (nearly ¬£4,200 in 2002's money ‚Äì to compare, the average lighthouse keeper's wage in 1895 was ¬£140 a year). ** December: Travers tries another search for the bird, again without success. * 1896 ** 13 May: Travers, unable to sell the birds at such a high price, now wants to sell his specimens for ¬£12 each, about ¬£1,000 in 2002's money. ** June: Lyall gets assigned to another lighthouse and leaves Stephens Island. ** 31 December ‚Äì 7 January or longer: Hugo H. Schauinsland collects birds on Stephens Island, but cannot find many and no \\"wrens\\" at all. On 7 January, he collects the only specimen of the local South Island piopio acquired during his stay. It is the last record of that species. * 1897 ** 31 July: The principal lighthouse keeper, Patrick Henaghan, requests shotguns and ammunition from the Marine Department to destroy the \\"large number of cats running wild on the island.\\" * 1898 ** 5 September: Travers writes James Hector that he has one more specimen available. At some time before this date, he had sold Buller one specimen for Henry Baker Tristram and claimed he had two additional ones. ** 27 December: Travers writes to Hector, saying that Stephens Island \\"is now swarming with cats\\". * 1899 ** 1 August: The new principal lighthouse keeper, Robert Cathcart, shoots over 100 feral cats since his arrival on 24 November 1898. * 1901 ** Travers offers \\"his specimen of the Stephen's Island Wren\\" to the government for ¬£35 (c. ¬£2700 in 2002); apparently, the bird is bought and deposited at the Colonial Museum with other skins. The collection is not reviewed until 1904, by which time a fifth has to be discarded due to insect damage. No record is made of the specimen since the offer, but the eventual sales price suggests it was among the collection deposited at the Colonial Museum. * 1905 ** Travers sells one specimen to the Otago Museum. ** Buller publishes his Supplement, in which he keeps using his name Xenicus insularis. He furthermore quotes an anonymous correspondent to The Press: > \\"And we certainly think that it would be as well if the Marine Department, > in sending lighthouse keepers to isolated islands where interesting > specimens of native birds are known or believed to exist, were to see that > they are not allowed to take any cats with them, even if mouse-traps have to > be furnished at the cost of the state.\\" * 1907 ** Rothschild publishes his book, Extinct Birds. In a remarkable breach of nil nisi bonum (especially considering both men's social standing), it contains several acrimonious attacks on Buller, who had died the previous year. * 1925 ** The last cats on the island were exterminated. Considering Buller's August 1895 note, it is probable that the species was exterminated by feral cats during the winter of 1895. Assuming the date of February 1894 for cat introduction was correct (there were certainly cats around in the winter months of that year), the winter of 1895 would see the second generation of cats born on the island reaching an age where the wren would have made ideal prey. Habitat destruction, sometimes given as an additional reason for the birds' disappearance, was apparently not significant: in 1898, the island was described as heavily forested and there was little interference with habitat beyond the lighthouse and its associated buildings. Large-scale destruction of habitat started in late 1903, by which time T. lyalli was certainly extinct. Specimens The Carnegie Museum specimen About 16‚Äì18 specimens (excluding subfossil bones) are now known. They were collected by the lighthouse keeper's cat, by the keepers themselves and by professional collectors. * Rothschild's specimens, all of which were collected between July and October 1894: ** Natural History Museum, London: three (NHM 1895.10.17.13; 1939.12.9.76; 1939.12.9.77). ** American Museum of Natural History, New York City: four (AMNH AM 554502; AM 554503; AM 554504; AM 554505). ** Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia: one (ANSP 108,631). ** Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts: one (MCZ 249,400). * Buller's specimens, collected at unknown dates between 1894 and 1899: ** Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh: one (CMNH 24639), labelled as female and dated 1894 in Buller's handwriting. Apart from the date discrepancy, it could be the bird Buller spoke of in August 1895; possibly the specimen was collected months before Buller had examined it. Alternatively, it could be the Bethune bird in case Buller kept it (he initially seems to believe it to be a female), as Rothschild (1907) believed. DNA analysis could, at least, clarify the bird's sex. ** Canterbury Museum, Christchurch: AV917 and AV918, a pair from the collection of Buller's son, dated 1899. They were acquired between late 1896 and 1899, but may have been collected before that date. * World Museum Liverpool: one (B 18.10.98.10). Purchased by Buller from Travers for Tristram, probably after late 1896 (but may have been collected earlier). Sold to the museum in October 1898. * Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Wellington: one (OR.005098) mounted specimen without data; may be Travers' specimen sold in 1901 or another one. This photograph by Dr Paddy Ryan shows the Te Papa specimen and another one ‚Äì possibly the Otago Museum bird, but the matter is not clear. * Otago Museum, Dunedin: one, but two catalog numbers (AV739 and AV7577) exist. It is not clear whether they represent re-cataloguing of the one specimen sold by Travers in 1905, or whether a specimen was lost. * Unaccounted for (all collected in 1894 or very early in 1895): ** Bethune's specimen: lent to Buller for the description, apparently later given back. If so, it was probably deposited at the Colonial Museum (now part of Te Papa) for safekeeping between 1895 and 1897, or ** Buller's female mentioned in August 1895, or even both (if neither is CMNH 24639). ** Two of Lyall's first three specimens (one was given to Bethune) remain unaccounted for. They may be part of Rothschild's nine, or Buller's three. They were not in Buller's possession as of early February 1895. ** Travers' \\"lost\\" specimen referred to in January 1895. It is not certain that this specimen was indeed lost; it may have been one of the alcohol-preserved specimens mentioned in November 1895 and Travers may simply have withheld it so he could fetch a higher price as the bird became extinct. In the media Lyall's wren was featured in the episode \\"Strange Islands\\" of the documentary series South Pacific that originally aired on 13 June 2009. It was also featured in the YouTube show \\"Citation Needed\\" from Tom Scott which aired 8 June 2017.

Life Born Sarah Taylor in Norwich, England in 1793, she was the youngest child of John Taylor, a yarn maker and hymn writer from a locally well-known Unitarian family.Taylor, Edward (1826). Obituary ‚Äì Mr. John Taylor. The Monthly Repository of Theology and General Literature vol xxi, 482‚Äì494. Her education was overseen by her mother, Susannah Taylor. She became conversant in Latin, French, German and Italian. Her six brothers and sisters included Edward Taylor (1784‚Äì1863), a singer and music professor, John Taylor (1779‚Äì1863), a mining engineer, Richard Taylor (1781‚Äì1858), a printer and editor and publisher of scientific works. Family friends included Dr James Alderson and his daughter Amelia Opie, Henry Crabb Robinson, the banking Gurneys and Sir James Mackintosh. Sarah grew up to be an attractive woman. She caused some surprise by marrying John Austin (1790‚Äì1859) on 24 August 1819. During the first years of their married life they lived a wide social life in Queen's Square, Westminster. John Stuart Mill testified the esteem which he felt for her by the title of Mutter, by which he always addressed her. Jeremy Bentham was also in their circle. She travelled widely, for instance to Dresden and Weimar. According to a modern scholar, Austin \\"tended to be austere, reclusive, and insecure, while she was very determined, ambitious, energetic, gregarious, and warm. Indeed her affections were so starved that in the early 1830s she had a most unusual 'affair' with Hermann P√ºckler-Muskau, a German prince whose work she translated.Briefe eines Verstorbenen (1831), as Letters of a Dead Man. It was conducted solely by an exchange of letters and she did not meet her correspondent until their passions had cooled.\\"Wilfrid E. Rumble's ODNB entry for John Austin: Retrieved 4 January 2012. Subscription required. The only child of the Austins' marriage, Lucie was likewise a translator of German works. She married Alexander Duff-Gordon. Her 1843 translation of Stories of the Gods and Heroes of Greece by Barthold Georg Niebuhr was erroneously ascribed to her mother. The family history was recorded in Three Generations of English Women (1893), by Sarah Taylor's granddaughter, Mrs Janet Ross.ODNB entry for Sarah Austin. Works Austin's literary translations were a principal means of financial support for the couple. She also did much to promote her husband's works during his life and published a collection of his lectures on jurisprudence after his death. In 1833, she published Selections from the Old Testament, arranged under heads to illustrate the religion, morality, and poetry of the Hebrew Scriptures. \\"My sole object has been,\\" she wrote in the preface, \\"to put together all that presented itself to my own heart and mind as most persuasive, consolatory, or elevating, in such a form and order as to be easy of reference, conveniently arranged and divided, and freed from matter either hard to be understood, unattractive, or unprofitable (to say the least) for young and pure eyes.\\" In the same year, she published one of the translations by which she is best known: Characteristics of Goethe from the German of Falk, Von M√ºller, and others, with valuable original notes, illustrative of German literature. Her own criticisms are few, but highly relevant. In 1834, Austin translated The Story without an End by Friedrich Wilhelm Carov√©, which was often reprinted. In the same year she translated the famous report on the State of Public Instruction in Prussia, addressed by Victor Cousin to Count Montalivet, minister of public instruction. In the preface she pleads eloquently for the cause of national education. \\"Society,\\" she says, \\"is no longer a calm current, but a tossing sea; reverence for tradition, for authority, is gone. In such a state of things who can deny the absolute necessity of national education?\\" In 1839 she returned to the same subject in a pamphlet, originally published as an article in the Foreign Quarterly Review, in which she argued from the experience of Prussia and France for the need to establish a national system of education in England. One of her last publications (1859) consisted of two letters addressed to the Athen√¶um, on girls' schools and on the training of working women, which show that she had modified her opinions. Speaking of the old village schools, she admits that the teachers possessed little book lore. They were often widows and trained their pupils to be the wives of working men. In 1827 Mrs Austin left with her husband for Germany and settled in Bonn. She collected in her long residence abroad materials for her work, Germany from 1760 to 1814, which was published in 1854 and still holds its place as an interesting and thoughtful survey of German institutions and manners. In the autumn of 1836 she accompanied her husband to Malta, busying herself while there with investigations into the remains of Maltese art. On their return from that island, she and her husband returned to Germany. Thence they passed to Paris, where they remained until they were driven home by the revolution of 1848. In 1840 she translated Leopold von Ranke's History of the Popes, which was warmly praised by Thomas Babington Macaulay and Henry Hart Milman. When this translation was published, her intimate friend Sir George Cornewall Lewis wrote to her saying, \\"Murray is very desirous that you should undertake some original work. Do you feel a 'Beruf' of this sort?\\" However, she felt no such \\"Beruf\\" (a calling or vocation) and most of her subsequent works were translations. After her husband's death in 1859 Sarah Austin produced a coherent and near-complete edition of his Lectures on Jurisprudence, an enormous task that required assembling his scattered notes and marginalia. Her modesty regarding her contribution to her husband's publications was recognized only by later authors She also edited the Memoirs of Sydney Smith (1855) and Lady Duff-Gordon's Letters from Egypt (1865). Sarah Austin's style is clear, unaffected and forcible. She adopted a high standard for the duties of a translator and sought to conform to it rigorously. \\"It has been my invariable practice,\\" she said, \\"as soon as I have engaged to translate a work, to write to the author of it, announcing my intention, and adding that if he has any correction, omission, or addition to make, he might depend on my paying attention to his suggestions.\\" She did much to make the best minds of Germany familiar to Englishmen and she left a literary reputation due as much to her conversation and wide correspondence with illustrious men of letters as to her works. The following is a list of her other principal works, not named so far: *Translation of a Tour in England, Ireland, and France by a German Prince, (London, 1832), after P√ºckler's Briefe eines Verstorbenen *Translation of Raumer's England in 1835, 1836. *Fragments from German Prose Writers, 1841. *History of the Reformation in Germany and History of the Popes (1840), from the German of Leopold von Ranke *Sketches of Germany from 1760 to 1814 (1854), dealing with political and social circumstances during that period. *Translation of Fran√ßois Guizot on the Causes of the Success of the English Revolution, 1850. *Memoirs of the Duchess of Orleans, 1859. *Lady Duff Gordon's Letters from Egypt, edited by Mrs. Austin, 1865. *Letters of Sydney Smith, 1855 (second volume of Lady Holland's Life and Letters).

He is one of the best known authors of the \\"Gera√ß√£o D'Orpheu\\", and is usually considered their greatest poet, after Fernando Pessoa. Life M√°rio de S√°-Carneiro was born to a wealthy family with a strong military tradition. His mother died in 1892 when he was two years old, and he was subsequently raised by his grandparents. He lived on a farm near Lisbon where he would spend most of his life. S√°-Carneiro started writing poems at the age of 12. By the age of 15, he had already translated several works by Victor Hugo. By 16, he had translated some works of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Friedrich Schiller. He began to write fiction in high school, partly due to his work as an actor. In 1911, he left for Coimbra, where he was admitted to law school, although he never progressed beyond his first year. However, he met a man who would soon become his closest friend, Fernando Pessoa, and who introduced him to the group of modernists of Lisbon. After leaving the city of students, as Coimbra is known, S√°-Carneiro went to Paris to study at the Sorbonne. Although his father continued to pay for his studies, S√°-Carneiro stopped attending classes very soon after arriving in Paris. He lived a bohemian lifestyle, roaming round the theatres and bars. It was in Paris that he met Guilherme de Santa-Rita (Santa-Rita Pintor), the legendary Portuguese painter. =Orpheu= Together with Fernando Pessoa and Almada Negreiros, he wrote for Orpheu, a literary journal of poetry and artistic prose influenced by cosmopolitanism and the European Avant-Garde. The magazine caused a scandal in Portuguese society because of its futuristic idealism. Only two issues of the magazine were published. A third one was prepared but never published, owing to the controversy surrounding the magazine and a lack of money. Today, Orpheu is known for being one of the finest and most important examples of Portuguese literature, and for introducing modernism in Portugal. =Depression= S√°-Carneiro memorial slab on the building where he committed suicide, on April 26, 1916 (Rue Victor-Mass√© 29, Paris). In July 1915, S√°- Carneiro returned to Paris by train. He planned, with Fernando Pessoa, to publish issue no. 3 of Orpheu, but his father and sponsor of the magazine, living in Mozambique at the time, refused to disburse more money. While World War I was in progress in the north of France, he left the university and started a relationship with a prostitute. A few months later, with growing financial problems and suffering from depression, S√°-Carneiro wrote a dramatic letter to Fernando Pessoa on March 31, 1916: :\\"Unless there occurs a miracle, next Monday, March (or even the day before), your friend M√°rio de S√°-Carneiro will take a strong dose of strychnine and disappear from this world.\\" Extremely unhappy with his life, he still delayed the suicide by almost one month. But, as he had proclaimed, at the age of 25 he killed himself by swallowing a large dose of strychnine on 26 April 1916, at the H√¥tel de Nice in the Montmartre district of Paris. Orpheu nr.3 was never published. Work M√°rio de S√°-Carneiro In 1912, he wrote his first play, Amizade (the title means friendship), in partnership with Tom√°s Cabreira J√∫nior. In the same year, he published Pr√≠ncipio, a collection of novels. In 1913, he published A Confiss√£o de L√∫cio, one of his most famous works. This novel has a story where the fantastic reigns and it's a mirror to this age of Avant-garde. In 1915, the work C√©u em Fogo, that gathered twelve novellas, was published. This book reveals the obsessions and disturbances that S√°-Carneiro was living with at the time. S√°-Carneiro's first publication of poetry was Dispers√£o, published in 1913, which included twelve poems. He wrote another book, Ind√≠cios de Oiro, but it was not published until over twenty years after his death, in the magazine Presen√ßa. In 1946 these two books were published along with some of S√°-Carneiro's poems in the Orpheu magazine as a unique book. His literary influences include Edgar Allan Poe, Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire, St√©phane Mallarm√©, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Ces√°rio Verde and Ant√≥nio Nobre. English poet Ted Hughes translated three of his poems into English.Ted Hughes‚Äô Theory and Practice of Translation American poet Sylvia Plath also admired his work, in particular his novel A Confiss√£o de L√∫cio (L√∫cio's Confession).Do Orfeu a Sylvia Plath: S√°-Carneiro imortal, Observador, 1 May 2016 (Portuguese) Centennial Anniversary of M√°rio de S√°-Carneiro's death The 100th anniversary of M√°rio de S√°-Carneiro's death, on April 26, 2016, was highlighted in Portugal and abroad with a number of publications and events, such as the colloquium \\"S√°-Carneiro et les autres\\" (Paris), the exhibit \\"Mil Anos Me Separam de Amanh√£\\" (Paredes de Coura), integrated in the festival Realizar-Poesia, an exhibit at the Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal, titled \\"M√°rio de S√°-Carneiro, 'O Homem S√£o Louco'\\", and a conference and audio- theatre at the Casa Fernando Pessoa.

Kornbluth. It was originally published in 1955 by Doubleday. It was serialized in Maclean's magazine (Canada) in May and June 1955. A revised edition with a new foreword and afterword by Frederik Pohl was published in 1981 by Tor Books, . The title comes from author Ernest Hemingway's \\"Notes on the Next War\\". Plot summary By 1965, the United States and Canada have been at war with the Soviet Union and China for three years. Both sides' atomic weapons are ineffective as surface-to-air missiles shoot down any bombers or guided missiles, so ground forces have done most of the fighting. The Communist nations‚Äîwhose armies greatly outnumber the North Americans‚Äîconquered Western Europe, invaded South America, and are moving toward Texas. All American males are required to either perform agricultural work to feed the armed forces or be drafted into military, construction, or factory service. Food, electricity, and gasoline are rationed, only two CONELRAD stations broadcast on radio, and New York City is reportedly under martial law. Billy Justin, a 37-year-old commercial artist and Korean War veteran, is working as a dairy farmer in Chiunga Center, New York when the radio announces that Soviet and Chinese forces have overrun the Canadian- American line at El Paso, Texas. The last American naval forces were destroyed three months earlier but the news had been kept secret. The Communist armies destroy in Los Alamos, New Mexico the incomplete Yankee Doodle, a satellite capable of dropping hydrogen bombs from orbit that are impossible to shoot down. The President of the United States surrenders to the Communists, who over the next several months divide the country at the Mississippi River, and together form the North American People's Democratic Republic. Other than a military garrison, a formal disarmament, searches for fissionable material, and the establishment of production quotas for food, the surrender of the United States leaves Chiunga Center largely untouched. The Soviets execute the Communist fifth column members who had secretly aided the invasion to prevent them from organizing against the new government, but are otherwise relatively peaceful and amenable to the black market. A paraplegic comes to Justin's farm asking for work; he is General Hollerith, a veteran of the previous war. He and Justin join a conspiracy to finish the real satellite, a manned space station buried in Chiunga County that the United States had been building for 15 years. It requires parts and engineering knowledge to launch. MVD troops arrive, shoot the corrupt Soviet soldiers, and are much more cruel. They capture, to Justin's knowledge, all of the conspirators but himself and the general. Justin deduces that the contacts he needs to make are in Washington, Pennsylvania. With a traveling preacher, Sparhawk, Justin walks the hundreds of miles from Chiunga Center to Washington, benefiting from the Democratic Republic's policy of respecting the Americans' freedom of religion. At Washington Justin receives instructions from the nationwide resistance movement for an attack planned for Christmas Eve on Chiunga Center to liberate the satellite. Despite the Soviets' arrest and torture of a local farmer, they are ignorant of what \\"Christmas Eve\\", a mild oath they have heard sworn by various citizens, means until the battle begins. Coordinated by Hollerith, bridges around the area are blown up and nearby arsenals are sabotaged. The townspeople, many of whom are veterans, battle the Soviets as the space station launches. Hollerith's forces triumph, and the Americans transmit an ultimatum to the Soviets and Chinese: The satellite is armed and will destroy Moscow and Peking in 24 hours if occupation soldiers do not leave American soil and free all prisoners of war. Hollerith offers Justin important positions in the new government and society, but he refuses them and kneels in prayer with Sparhawk, fearing the fulfillment of mutual assured destruction. Reception Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale praised the novel as \\"believable throughout and thoroughly frightening.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, January 1955, p.92 The Boston Herald gave a positive review and the Chicago Tribune called it \\"The most shockingly realistic science fiction book since Orwell's 1984....\\" Notes References * External links * Category:American science fiction novels Category:1955 American novels Category:1955 science fiction novels Category:Invasion literature Category:Novels by Cyril M.

He was the first Republican Governor of Florida since Reconstruction. Early life Kirk was born in San Bernardino, California. He lived in Chicago, Illinois, and Montgomery, Alabama, where he attended Sidney Lanier High School. After graduating at age seventeen, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps reserve and rose to the rank of second lieutenant, having served stateside during World War II. He briefly attended Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, before he transferred to Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree. Kirk was accepted at the University of Alabama School of Law in Tuscaloosa and graduated in 1949. He was recalled to the Marines for the Korean War and was initially assigned to the 1st Marine Division. He later served aboard the battleship USS New Jersey and was discharged as a first lieutenant in 1952.Bousquet, Steve: \\"Former Florida Gov. Claude Kirk dies at age 85\\" St. Petersburg Times, September 28, 2011 Business Kirk worked as an insurance salesman and sold building supplies before partnering with W. Ashley Verlander in 1956 to start the American Heritage Life Insurance Company in Jacksonville, Florida. He had no money of his own, so he recruited investors and his brother-in-law to bankroll the venture. The firm catered to the wealthy and quickly became one of the most successful in the industry, earning Kirk a fortune. Six years later, he left American Heritage Life and purchased a partnership in the New York securities firm, Hayden Stone, selling investments to Floridians.Basse, Craig: \\"Former Gov. Claude Kirk dead\\" Lakeland Ledger, September 28, 2011 Early political career In 1960, Kirk switched his party affiliation from Democrat to Republican and headed the \\"Floridians for Nixon\\" campaign, which helped the Republican Party win the state's then ten electoral votes for the third consecutive time. In 1964, Kirk ran as a Republican against veteran Democratic US Senator Spessard Holland, a former governor and epitome of the Florida Democratic establishment. He was considered a placeholder on the ballot, with Republican presidential nominee Barry M. Goldwater losing Florida to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. Kirk polled 36.1 percent of the vote. Thereafter, Kirk became embroiled in an intraparty squabble with US Representative William C. Cramer of St. Petersburg. Cramer recalled Kirk having \\"begged me\\" to allow him to address meetings held during the 1964 delegate and national committeeman races. Thus, Kirk became acquainted with Republican activists who could be helpful to him his later career.Billy Hathorn, \\"Cramer v. Kirk: The Florida Republican Schism of 1970\\", Florida Historical Quarterly (April 1990), p. 407 Governor Governor Kirk official painting In 1966, Kirk scored a huge upset to become governor, defeating Democrat Robert King High, the mayor of Miami, 55‚Äì45 percent. High had unseated incumbent governor Haydon Burns, a Conservative Democrat, in the Democratic primary. In the general election, Kirk won majorities in 56 of the state's 67 counties.State of Florida, General election returns, November 8, 1966 Burns's refusal to support High was a major factor in Kirk's decisive victory in the general election. Upon taking the oath of office on January 3, 1967, he became the state's first Republican governor in 90 years. During his single four-year term in office, a new Florida Constitution went into effect in 1968. The governor was often at odds with both Democrats and his Republican colleagues in the legislature on issues such as growth and taxes. He earned the nickname Claudius Maximus because of his brash, acerbic style of leadership and opinionated, colorful personality.Bauerlein, David: \\"Former Florida governor Claude Kirk dies\\" Florida Times-Union, September 28, 2011 A significant event of his tenure was a controversial statewide teachers' strike in 1968. One of the major themes of Kirk's campaign was his strong support for capital punishment, in contrast to Collins', Bryant's and Burns' opposition to capital punishment. Kirk promised to resume executions (the last had taken place in Florida in 1964), but no executions occurred during his administration, mostly because of an informal nationwide moratorium. Kirk made headlines when, during the campaign, he visited Florida State Prison and, after shaking hands with several death row inmates, said, \\"If I'm elected, I may have to sign your death warrants.\\"Michael Mello, Deathwork: Defending the Condemned, University of Minnesota Press, 2002, , Kirk's management style was described as flamboyant and confrontational. He especially opposed court-ordered mandatory busing. In 1970, as he geared for a reelection bid, he tried to halt a desegregation plan in Manatee County. He quipped that the pro-busing judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, were \\"drinking in the French Quarter and reading dirty books.\\"Miami Herald, September 5, 1970 Although he had a Democratic-controlled legislature, Democrats did not have a veto-proof majority during Kirk's term of office. During Kirk's term, the Dade County Port Authority began secretly buying land in the Everglades to build an airport. Governor Kirk turned a ceremonial shovel of dirt at the groundbreaking. Kirk was a strong supporter of what would have been the world's largest airport despite evidence that it would destroy the water- recharge area South Florida needed. His transportation secretary, Michael O'Neil, stated, \\"I call the Everglades a swamp. My children can't play in it.\\" The work was ultimately halted on September 17, 1969, after an Interior Department study ordered by Nixon. After the publication of John Filo's photograph showing Mary Ann Vecchio of Florida kneeling over the body of Jeffrey Miller at the Kent State University shootings on May 4, 1970, then Governor Kirk publicly labeled Vecchio a dissident \\"communist\\".Munzenrieder, Kyle: \\"Former Florida Gov. Claude Kirk, \\"a Tree-Shakin' Son of a Bitch,\\" Dies at 85\\" Miami New Times, September 28, 2011 Feud with Cramer The schism between Cramer and Kirk accelerated in 1966 to the point that in a 1988 interview, Kirk said that he could not recall Cramer having rendered him any assistance at all in either the 1964 or 1966 campaigns: \\"Cramer never helped me do anything. At all times he was a total combatant.\\"\\"Cramer v. Kirk,\\" p. 408 Kirk claimed that Cramer wanted the 1966 gubernatorial nomination himself after Burns, the primary loser, refused to endorse Mayor High, an ally of U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York. Kirk said that Cramer's legislative assistant, Jack P. Inscoe, later a real estate developer from Tampa, could verify that Cramer had asked Kirk to bow out of the race with High. Kirk claimed that the three met \\"in a car... probably in Palm Beach County.\\" Inscoe said: \\"This never happened. Kirk is not known for telling too much truth.\\" Though Cramer said that he had no ambition to be governor, Kirk retorted, \\"How could I have brought this up if it didn't happen?\\" Cramer said that he subsequently urged Kirk to merge his own organization into the regular party structure in Cramer's home county of Pinellas. However, Kirk maintained a separate entity in the hope of maximizing crossover support from conservative Democrats unhappy with the nomination of Mayor High. Cramer recalled this disagreement over strategy as the \\"first indication that Kirk intended to do his own thing and attempt to form his own organization within the Republican Party in Florida. I didn't get the signal at the time, but it became very obvious later, particularly when he attempted to defeat me as national committeeman in 1968.\\" Kirk asked the representative and later Senator Edward Gurney of Winter Park serve as chairman of the 1967 gubernatorial inauguration although Gurney had not been involved in the Kirk campaign. By contrast, Cramer was not even asked to serve on the inaugural committee. In 1968, Governor Kirk dispatched his staff to the Republican state convention in Orlando to push for Cramer's ouster as national committeeman. Kirk justified his move against Cramer: \\"I wanted my own man. After all, I was the leader of the party. If Cramer had been the leader of the party, he would have wanted his own man too.\\"\\"Cramer v. Kirk,\\" p. 409 Cramer said that Kirk was attempting to be \\"not only the governor but the king of the party, and I was about the only person at the time who stood in his way from taking total control.\\" Despite Kirk's opposition, Cramer attributed his retention in 1968 as national committeeman to the loyalty of organizational Republicans: \\"I had proved myself an effective congressman. I was on the House leadership as vice chairman of the Republican Conference and was ranking member on the then named House Public Works Committee.\\" In 1988, Cramer recalled a visit 21 years earlier to Kirk's office when a former state legislator was denied an appointment with the governor even though the man was a stalwart Republican. According to Cramer, \\"Kirk made it very clear that he got a great deal of joy in making sure that this guy didn't get an appointment.... He just loved to kick people in the teeth to show how much power he had.\\" Despite observing this incident, Cramer said that party unity led him to avoid public criticism of Kirk. Cramer viewed Kirk as \\"his own worst enemy.\\" Kirk claimed that he had never had a \\"serious discussion\\" on any topic with Cramer. Walter Wurfel, a Floridian who was later U.S. President Jimmy Carter's deputy press secretary, termed Kirk's election in 1966 as \\"the worst thing that could have happened to the Republicans. He wasn't interested in the Republican Party; party was a matter of convenience for him.\\"Alexander P. Lamis, The Two-Party South (New York, 1984), p. 292 Cramer said he believed that Kirk may have become vice president or even president had he tended to his gubernatorial duties rather than openly seeking the second position. Eyeing the vice presidency in 1968, Kirk stood alone in the Florida delegation at the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach by supporting Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, rather than the clear frontrunner, Richard Nixon. Cramer said that Nixon may have selected Kirk, rather than Spiro T. Agnew of Maryland for the second slot had Kirk concentrated on his duties of office. Kirk claimed that it \\"had been agreed\\" that he would run with either Rockefeller or Nixon, but Nixon chose Agnew in the hope of enhancing campaign contributions from Greek American businessmen.\\"Cramer v. Kirk\\", pp. 409-410 Defeat In 1970, Kirk was challenged in the primary by drug store magnate Jack Eckerd of Clearwater and state senator and later US Representative L. A. \\"Skip\\" Bafalis. Eckerd said that though he had supported Kirk in 1966, he became disappointed and embarrassed with Kirk: \\"I was offended by his public behavior and chagrined that he was a Republican.\\"\\"Cramer v. Kirk\\", p. 416 With no candidate getting 50%, Kirk and Eckerd met in a runoff, which Kirk won. The challenges strained Kirk and used up campaign funds. Despite Kirk's tactics, Eckerd said \\"time heals all wounds, and now I chuckle about it.\\" He added that his defeat in 1970 probably prolonged his life.Jack M. Eckerd and Charles P. Conn, Eckerd (Old Tappan, New Jersey, 1987), pp. 113-119 In the general election, Kirk lost 57%-43% to Democrat state senator Reubin O'Donovan Askew, from Pensacola. In that same 1970 general election, William Cramer, Kirk's intraparty nemesis, lost to Democrat Lawton Chiles (himself a future Florida governor) of Lakeland for the U.S. Senate seat that Spessard Holland finally vacated. Cramer had defeated Kirk's preferred Senate choice, Fifth Circuit Court Judge G. Harrold Carswell of Tallahassee. When Kirk's term of office ended on January 5, 1971, he returned to his business pursuits, but he later campaigned several times for governor, senator, and Florida commissioner of education under both Democratic (1978) and Republican (1990) labels. Personal life Kirk met Sarah Stokes while he was in law school. Her family owned an automobile dealership, and the couple married in 1947. They were divorced in 1950, but remarried in 1951. The union produced four children: two daughters, Sarah and Kitty, and twin sons Frank and Will. They divorced for the final time in 1966. In a 1967 interview, Sarah Stokes commented that Kirk \\"drinks to excess quite often (and) has indiscreet public associations with other women\\".Associated Press: \\"Former Florida. Gov. Claude Kirk Dies At 85\\" National Public Radio, September 28, 2011 A divorcee when he took office, Kirk, then 41, married German-born Erika Mattfeld, 33, on February 18, 1967. She was an actress whom he had met during an unsuccessful business venture in Brazil. From his final marriage he had two daughters and a son. Kirk's daughter Kitty married Ander Crenshaw, a former U.S. Representative from Florida's 4th congressional district. In February 2011, Kirk survived a mild heart attack. He died in his sleep on September 28, 2011. Electoral history United States Senate election in Florida, 1964: *Spessard L. Holland (D) (inc.) ‚Äì 997,585 (63.93%) *Claude R.

The domain name was acquired by Al Jazeera Media Network in March 2011 from Aljazeera Publishing, a Dubai- based media company which owned the separate Aljazeera Magazine, after a long- running domain name dispute between the two entities. Al Jazeera English began promoting aljazeera.com instead of aljazeera.net/english since the domain name became part of Al Jazeera English. It is also used and subdivided as the homepage for the channels of Al Jazeera America and Al Jazeera Balkans. Al Jazeera Media Network also owns the original Aljazeera.net for their Arabic language channels and properties and Aljazeera.tr for their Turkish language properties including Al Jazeera Turk. History of Al Jazeera Magazine Until March 2011, aljazeera.com was an English language website for Aljazeera Magazine, which was unrelated to the Arabic satellite TV channel Al Jazeera; the latter operated websites in both Arabic (www.aljazeera.net) and English (english.aljazeera.net). It was also unrelated to Al Jazeera Newspaper of Saudi Arabia. According to Alexa, there were fewer visitors to aljazeera.com in comparison to aljazeera.net. The former website was operated by Aljazeera Publishing, described as an \\"independent media organisation.\\" =Domain name dispute= In 2005, the Al Jazeera TV channel attempted to obtain the aljazeera.com domain name but failed. In the Administrative Panel Decision, the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center found the TV Channel to have brought the proceedings in bad faith and found it had abused the administrative proceedings. As of 2006, Aljazeera.com wrote on their About page: :\\"Important note: Aljazeera Publishing and Aljazeera.com are not associated with any of the below organisations: :1. Al Jazeera Newspaper, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia whose website is al-jazirah.com :2. Al Jazeera Satellite Channel whose website is aljazeera.net. :3. Al Jazeera Information Centre who website is aljazeerah.info :Aljazeera Publishing disassociates itself from the views, opinions and broadcasts of these titles.\\" Views presented by Aljazeera.com are frequently misattributed to the Al Jazeera TV channel, including one case in which The Times criticised the channel in its leader column based on material published on Aljazeera.com, for which the newspaper later apologised. The magazine's editorial slant appears markedly different than that of the Al Jazeera TV channel, with the former far more critical of U.S. and Israeli policy than the latter. In April 2011, the domain aljazeera.com directed to Al Jazeera English, and the domain ownership as listed on WHOIS records was updated from Al Jazeera Publishing to Al Jazeera Media Network. At the time of the purchase, a simple page stated \\"Moving to Doha\\", leading to certain long- time readers initially suspecting a hack of the website. No public details regarding the purchase of the domain has been made public by either party. Activity since takeover Since the takeover of aljazeera.com, Al Jazeera Media Network has subdivided the domain into other websites for their other non-Arabic news channels besides Al Jazeera English. In 2011 upon the launch of Al Jazeera Balkans the channel created balkans.aljazeera.com which became the main page for the Al Jazeera Balkans website. In 2013 Al Jazeera did it again with the website for Al Jazeera America creating america.aljazeera.com which is the main page for that channels website and to which aljazeera.com in the United States redirected to on the first click into aljazeera.com during the existence of the American channel. From there you would have the option of going to the Al Jazeera English page. Al Jazeera is also used the .aljazeera.com domain for specials between the two channels and cross links between the two. After the folding of Al Jazeera America and a re-design of the main aljazeera.com the america.aljazeera.com address beginning in November 2016 was redirected to the main Aljazeera.com In 2014 Al Jazeera created plus.aljazeera.com, a secondary page for their all digital, all online and video on demand channel AJ+.

Errors may be caused by a defect, usually understood either to be a mistake in design or construction, or a broken component. A soft error is also a signal or datum which is wrong, but is not assumed to imply such a mistake or breakage. After observing a soft error, there is no implication that the system is any less reliable than before. One cause of soft errors is single event upsets from cosmic rays. In a computer's memory system, a soft error changes an instruction in a program or a data value. Soft errors typically can be remedied by cold booting the computer. A soft error will not damage a system's hardware; the only damage is to the data that is being processed. There are two types of soft errors, chip-level soft error and system-level soft error. Chip-level soft errors occur when particles hit the chip, e.g., when secondary particles from cosmic rays land on the silicon die. If a particle with certain properties hits a memory cell it can cause the cell to change state to a different value. The atomic reaction in this example is so tiny that it does not damage the physical structure of the chip. System- level soft errors occur when the data being processed is hit with a noise phenomenon, typically when the data is on a data bus. The computer tries to interpret the noise as a data bit, which can cause errors in addressing or processing program code. The bad data bit can even be saved in memory and cause problems at a later time. If detected, a soft error may be corrected by rewriting correct data in place of erroneous data. Highly reliable systems use error correction to correct soft errors on the fly. However, in many systems, it may be impossible to determine the correct data, or even to discover that an error is present at all. In addition, before the correction can occur, the system may have crashed, in which case the recovery procedure must include a reboot. Soft errors involve changes to datathe electrons in a storage circuit, for examplebut not changes to the physical circuit itself, the atoms. If the data is rewritten, the circuit will work perfectly again. Soft errors can occur on transmission lines, in digital logic, analog circuits, magnetic storage, and elsewhere, but are most commonly known in semiconductor storage.  Critical charge  Whether or not a circuit experiences a soft error depends on the energy of the incoming particle, the geometry of the impact, the location of the strike, and the design of the logic circuit. Logic circuits with higher capacitance and higher logic voltages are less likely to suffer an error. This combination of capacitance and voltage is described by the critical charge parameter, Qcrit, the minimum electron charge disturbance needed to change the logic level. A higher Qcrit means fewer soft errors. Unfortunately, a higher Qcrit also means a slower logic gate and a higher power dissipation. Reduction in chip feature size and supply voltage, desirable for many reasons, decreases Qcrit. Thus, the importance of soft errors increases as chip technology advances. In a logic circuit, Qcrit is defined as the minimum amount of induced charge required at a circuit node to cause a voltage pulse to propagate from that node to the output and be of sufficient duration and magnitude to be reliably latched. Since a logic circuit contains many nodes that may be struck, and each node may be of unique capacitance and distance from output, Qcrit is typically characterized on a per-node basis.  Causes of soft errors  = Alpha particles from package decay = Soft errors became widely known with the introduction of dynamic RAM in the 1970s. In these early devices, ceramic chip packaging materials contained small amounts of radioactive contaminants. Very low decay rates are needed to avoid excess soft errors, and chip companies have occasionally suffered problems with contamination ever since. It is extremely hard to maintain the material purity needed. Controlling alpha particle emission rates for critical packaging materials to less than a level of 0.001 counts per hour per cm2 (cph/cm2) is required for reliable performance of most circuits. For comparison, the count rate of a typical shoe's sole is between 0.1 and 10 cph/cm2. Package radioactive decay usually causes a soft error by alpha particle emission. The positive charged alpha particle travels through the semiconductor and disturbs the distribution of electrons there. If the disturbance is large enough, a digital signal can change from a 0 to a 1 or vice versa. In combinational logic, this effect is transient, perhaps lasting a fraction of a nanosecond, and this has led to the challenge of soft errors in combinational logic mostly going unnoticed. In sequential logic such as latches and RAM, even this transient upset can become stored for an indefinite time, to be read out later. Thus, designers are usually much more aware of the problem in storage circuits. A 2011 Black Hat paper discusses the real-life security implications of such bit-flips in the Internet's DNS system. The paper found up to 3,434 incorrect requests per day due to bit-flip changes for various common domains. Many of these bit-flips would probably be attributable to hardware problems, but some could be attributed to alpha particles. These bit-flip errors may be taken advantage of by malicious actors in the form of bitsquatting. Isaac Asimov received a letter congratulating him on an accidental prediction of alpha-particle RAM errors in a 1950s novel.Gold (1995): \\"This letter is to inform you and congratulate you on another remarkable scientific prediction of the future; namely your foreseeing of the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) logic upset problem caused by alpha particle emission, first observed in 1977, but written about by you in Caves of Steel in 1957.\\" [Note: Actually, 1952.] ... \\"These failures are caused by trace amounts of radioactive elements present in the packaging material used to encapsulate the silicon devices ... in your book, Caves of Steel, published in the 1950s, you use an alpha particle emitter to 'murder' one of the robots in the story, by destroying ('randomizing') its positronic brain. This is, of course, as good a way of describing a logic upset as any I've heard ... our millions of dollars of research, culminating in several international awards for the most important scientific contribution in the field of reliability of semiconductor devices in 1978 and 1979, was predicted in substantially accurate form twenty years [Note: twenty-five years, actually] before the events took place = Cosmic rays creating energetic neutrons and protons = Once the electronics industry had determined how to control package contaminants, it became clear that other causes were also at work. James F. Ziegler led a program of work at IBM which culminated in the publication of a number of papers (Ziegler and Lanford, 1979) demonstrating that cosmic rays also could cause soft errors. Indeed, in modern devices, cosmic rays may be the predominant cause. Although the primary particle of the cosmic ray does not generally reach the Earth's surface, it creates a shower of energetic secondary particles. At the Earth's surface approximately 95% of the particles capable of causing soft errors are energetic neutrons with the remainder composed of protons and pions. IBM estimated in 1996 that one error per month per 256 MiB of ram was expected for a desktop computer. This flux of energetic neutrons is typically referred to as \\"cosmic rays\\" in the soft error literature. Neutrons are uncharged and cannot disturb a circuit on their own, but undergo neutron capture by the nucleus of an atom in a chip. This process may result in the production of charged secondaries, such as alpha particles and oxygen nuclei, which can then cause soft errors. Cosmic ray flux depends on altitude. For the common reference location of 40.7¬∞ N, 74¬∞ W at sea level (New York City, NY, USA) the flux is approximately 14 neutrons/cm2/hour. Burying a system in a cave reduces the rate of cosmic-ray induced soft errors to a negligible level. In the lower levels of the atmosphere, the flux increases by a factor of about 2.2 for every 1000 m (1.3 for every 1000 ft) increase in altitude above sea level. Computers operated on top of mountains experience an order of magnitude higher rate of soft errors compared to sea level. The rate of upsets in aircraft may be more than 300 times the sea level upset rate. This is in contrast to package decay induced soft errors, which do not change with location. As chip density increases, Intel expects the errors caused by cosmic rays to increase and become a limiting factor in design. The average rate of cosmic-ray soft errors is inversely proportional to sunspot activity. That is, the average number of cosmic-ray soft errors decreases during the active portion of the sunspot cycle and increases during the quiet portion. This counter-intuitive result occurs for two reasons. The Sun does not generally produce cosmic ray particles with energy above 1 GeV that are capable of penetrating to the Earth's upper atmosphere and creating particle showers, so the changes in the solar flux do not directly influence the number of errors. Further, the increase in the solar flux during an active sun period does have the effect of reshaping the Earth's magnetic field providing some additional shielding against higher energy cosmic rays, resulting in a decrease in the number of particles creating showers. The effect is fairly small in any case resulting in a ¬±7% modulation of the energetic neutron flux in New York City. Other locations are similarly affected. One experiment measured the soft error rate at the sea level to be 5,950 failures in time (FIT = failures per billion hours) per DRAM chip. When the same test setup was moved to an underground vault, shielded by over of rock that effectively eliminated all cosmic rays, zero soft errors were recorded. In this test, all other causes of soft errors are too small to be measured, compared to the error rate caused by cosmic rays. Energetic neutrons produced by cosmic rays may lose most of their kinetic energy and reach thermal equilibrium with their surroundings as they are scattered by materials. The resulting neutrons are simply referred to as thermal neutrons and have an average kinetic energy of about 25 millielectron-volts at 25 ¬∞C. Thermal neutrons are also produced by environmental radiation sources such as the decay of naturally occurring uranium or thorium. The thermal neutron flux from sources other than cosmic- ray showers may still be noticeable in an underground location and an important contributor to soft errors for some circuits. = Thermal neutrons = Neutrons that have lost kinetic energy until they are in thermal equilibrium with their surroundings are an important cause of soft errors for some circuits. At low energies many neutron capture reactions become much more probable and result in fission of certain materials creating charged secondaries as fission byproducts. For some circuits the capture of a thermal neutron by the nucleus of the 10B isotope of boron is particularly important. This nuclear reaction is an efficient producer of an alpha particle, 7Li nucleus and gamma ray. Either of the charged particles (alpha or 7Li) may cause a soft error if produced in very close proximity, approximately 5 ¬µm, to a critical circuit node. The capture cross section for 11B is 6 orders of magnitude smaller and does not contribute to soft errors. Boron has been used in BPSG, the insulator in the interconnection layers of integrated circuits, particularly in the lowest one. The inclusion of boron lowers the melt temperature of the glass providing better reflow and planarization characteristics. In this application the glass is formulated with a boron content of 4% to 5% by weight. Naturally occurring boron is 20% 10B with the remainder the 11B isotope. Soft errors are caused by the high level of 10B in this critical lower layer of some older integrated circuit processes. Boron-11, used at low concentrations as a p-type dopant, does not contribute to soft errors. Integrated circuit manufacturers eliminated borated dielectrics by the time individual circuit components decreased in size to 150 nm, largely due to this problem. In critical designs, depleted boronconsisting almost entirely of boron-11is used, to avoid this effect and therefore to reduce the soft error rate. Boron-11 is a by-product of the nuclear industry. For applications in medical electronic devices this soft error mechanism may be extremely important. Neutrons are produced during high-energy cancer radiation therapy using photon beam energies above 10 MeV. These neutrons are moderated as they are scattered from the equipment and walls in the treatment room resulting in a thermal neutron flux that is about 40 √ó 106 higher than the normal environmental neutron flux. This high thermal neutron flux will generally result in a very high rate of soft errors and consequent circuit upset. Franco, L., G√≥mez, F., Iglesias, A., Pardo, J., Pazos, A., Pena, J., Zapata, M., SEUs on commercial SRAM induced by low energy neutrons produced at a clinical linac facility, RADECS Proceedings, September 2005 = Other causes = Soft errors can also be caused by random noise or signal integrity problems, such as inductive or capacitive crosstalk. However, in general, these sources represent a small contribution to the overall soft error rate when compared to radiation effects. Some tests conclude that the isolation of DRAM memory cells can be circumvented by unintended side effects of specially crafted accesses to adjacent cells. Thus, accessing data stored in DRAM causes memory cells to leak their charges and interact electrically, as a result of high cells density in modern memory, altering the content of nearby memory rows that actually were not addressed in the original memory access. This effect is known as row hammer, and it has also been used in some privilege escalation computer security exploits.  Designing around soft errors  = Soft error mitigation= A designer can attempt to minimize the rate of soft errors by judicious device design, choosing the right semiconductor, package and substrate materials, and the right device geometry. Often, however, this is limited by the need to reduce device size and voltage, to increase operating speed and to reduce power dissipation. The susceptibility of devices to upsets is described in the industry using the JEDEC JESD-89 standard. One technique that can be used to reduce the soft error rate in digital circuits is called radiation hardening. This involves increasing the capacitance at selected circuit nodes in order to increase its effective Qcrit value. This reduces the range of particle energies to which the logic value of the node can be upset. Radiation hardening is often accomplished by increasing the size of transistors who share a drain/source region at the node. Since the area and power overhead of radiation hardening can be restrictive to design, the technique is often applied selectively to nodes which are predicted to have the highest probability of resulting in soft errors if struck. Tools and models that can predict which nodes are most vulnerable are the subject of past and current research in the area of soft errors. = Detecting soft errors= There has been work addressing soft errors in processor and memory resources using both hardware and software techniques. Several research efforts addressed soft errors by proposing error detection and recovery via hardware-based redundant multi-threading. These approaches used special hardware to replicate an application execution to identify errors in the output, which increased hardware design complexity and cost including high performance overhead. Software-based soft error tolerant schemes, on the other hand, are flexible and can be applied on commercial off-the-shelf microprocessors. Many works propose compiler-level instruction replication and result checking for soft error detection. = Correcting soft errors = Designers can choose to accept that soft errors will occur, and design systems with appropriate error detection and correction to recover gracefully. Typically, a semiconductor memory design might use forward error correction, incorporating redundant data into each word to create an error correcting code. Alternatively, roll-back error correction can be used, detecting the soft error with an error-detecting code such as parity, and rewriting correct data from another source. This technique is often used for write-through cache memories. Soft errors in logic circuits are sometimes detected and corrected using the techniques of fault tolerant design. These often include the use of redundant circuitry or computation of data, and typically come at the cost of circuit area, decreased performance, and/or higher power consumption. The concept of triple modular redundancy (TMR) can be employed to ensure very high soft-error reliability in logic circuits. In this technique, three identical copies of a circuit compute on the same data in parallel and outputs are fed into majority voting logic, returning the value that occurred in at least two of three cases. In this way, the failure of one circuit due to soft error is discarded assuming the other two circuits operated correctly. In practice, however, few designers can afford the greater than 200% circuit area and power overhead required, so it is usually only selectively applied. Another common concept to correct soft errors in logic circuits is temporal (or time) redundancy, in which one circuit operates on the same data multiple times and compares subsequent evaluations for consistency. This approach, however, often incurs performance overhead, area overhead (if copies of latches are used to store data), and power overhead, though is considerably more area-efficient than modular redundancy. Traditionally, DRAM has had the most attention in the quest to reduce or work around soft errors, due to the fact that DRAM has comprised the majority-share of susceptible device surface area in desktop, and server computer systems (ref. the prevalence of ECC RAM in server computers). Hard figures for DRAM susceptibility are hard to come by, and vary considerably across designs, fabrication processes, and manufacturers. 1980s technology 256 kilobit DRAMS could have clusters of five or six bits flip from a single alpha particle. Modern DRAMs have much smaller feature sizes, so the deposition of a similar amount of charge could easily cause many more bits to flip. The design of error detection and correction circuits is helped by the fact that soft errors usually are localised to a very small area of a chip. Usually, only one cell of a memory is affected, although high energy events can cause a multi-cell upset. Conventional memory layout usually places one bit of many different correction words adjacent on a chip. So, even a multi- cell upset leads to only a number of separate single-bit upsets in multiple correction words, rather than a multi-bit upset in a single correction word. So, an error correcting code needs only to cope with a single bit in error in each correction word in order to cope with all likely soft errors. The term 'multi-cell' is used for upsets affecting multiple cells of a memory, whatever correction words those cells happen to fall in. 'Multi-bit' is used when multiple bits in a single correction word are in error.  Soft errors in combinational logic  The three natural masking effects in combinational logic that determine whether a single event upset (SEU) will propagate to become a soft error are electrical masking, logical masking, and temporal (or timing-window) masking. An SEU is logically masked if its propagation is blocked from reaching an output latch because off-path gate inputs prevent a logical transition of that gate's output. An SEU is electrically masked if the signal is attenuated by the electrical properties of gates on its propagation path such that the resulting pulse is of insufficient magnitude to be reliably latched. An SEU is temporally masked if the erroneous pulse reaches an output latch, but it does not occur close enough to when the latch is actually triggered to hold. If all three masking effects fail to occur, the propagated pulse becomes latched and the output of the logic circuit will be an erroneous value. In the context of circuit operation, this erroneous output value may be considered a soft error event. However, from a microarchitectural-level standpoint, the affected result may not change the output of the currently- executing program. For instance, the erroneous data could be overwritten before use, masked in subsequent logic operations, or simply never be used. If erroneous data does not affect the output of a program, it is considered to be an example of microarchitectural masking.  Soft error rate  Soft error rate (SER) is the rate at which a device or system encounters or is predicted to encounter soft errors. It is typically expressed as either the number of failures-in-time (FIT) or mean time between failures (MTBF). The unit adopted for quantifying failures in time is called FIT, which is equivalent to one error per billion hours of device operation. MTBF is usually given in years of device operation; to put it into perspective, one FIT equals to approximately 1,000,000,000 / (24 √ó 365.25) = 114,077 times more than one-year MTBF. While many electronic systems have an MTBF that exceeds the expected lifetime of the circuit, the SER may still be unacceptable to the manufacturer or customer. For instance, many failures per million circuits due to soft errors can be expected in the field if the system does not have adequate soft error protection. The failure of even a few products in the field, particularly if catastrophic, can tarnish the reputation of the product and company that designed it. Also, in safety- or cost-critical applications where the cost of system failure far outweighs the cost of the system itself, a 1% chance of soft error failure per lifetime may be too high to be acceptable to the customer. Therefore, it is advantageous to design for low SER when manufacturing a system in high-volume or requiring extremely high reliability.

Retrieved 12 July 2013), was a Welsh writer for television and the author of several books on evolutionary anthropology, especially the aquatic ape hypothesis which she advocated as a corrective to what she saw as theories which purveyed gendered stereotypes and thus failed to adequately take account of women's role in human evolution. The Descent of Woman, published in 1972, became an international bestseller translated into ten languages. In 2016, she was named one of \\"the 50 greatest Welsh men and women of all time\\" in a press survey. Personal life Elaine Floyd was born and brought up in Hopkinstown, near Pontypridd, in Wales. She lived for many years until her death, in Mountain Ash, near Aberdare. She graduated from Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, with a degree in English. She married Morien Morgan (died 1997) and had three sons, her eldest being Dylan Morgan. Writing Elaine Morgan began writing in the 1950s after winning a competition in the New Statesman, successfully publishing, then joining the BBC when it began to produce her plays for television. Morgan's works included popular dramas, newspaper columns, and a series of publications on evolutionary anthropology.News Are we all Aquatic apes?Cardiff University Morgan's first book, The Descent of Woman, published in 1972, became an international bestseller translated into ten languages. Her book drew attention to what she saw as sexism inherent in the prevalent savannah-based \\"killer ape\\" theories of human evolution as presented in popular anthropological works by Robert Ardrey, Lionel Tiger and others. She argued that such \\"Tarzanist\\" anthropological narratives purveyed gendered stereotypes of women that failed to take adequate account of women's role in human evolution. The Aquatic Ape (1982), The Scars of Evolution (1990), The Descent of the Child (1994), The Aquatic Ape Hypothesis (1997) and The Naked Darwinist (2008) all explored her alternative account of human evolution in more detail. She also published Falling Apart: the Rise and Decline of Urban Civization in 1976 and Pinker's List in 2016, a critique of Steven Pinker's The Blank Slate. Morgan wrote for many television series, including the adaptations of How Green Was My Valley (1975), Off to Philadelphia in the Morning (1978) and Testament of Youth (1979). Her other work included episodes of Dr. Finlay's Casebook (1963‚Äì1970), the biographical drama The Life and Times of David Lloyd George (1981) and contributions to the Campion (1989) series. She won two BAFTAs and two Writers' Guild awards. She also wrote the script for the Horizon documentary about Joey Deacon, the disabled fund- raiser, so winning the Prix Italia in 1975.

Aquatic ape hypothesis thumb Morgan has promoted a version of the Aquatic ape hypothesis, which proposes that human evolution had an \\"aquatic phase\\" in the Miocene or Pliocene epoch. Although Elaine Morgan's promotion of the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis is still generally ignored by anthropologists and criticized by some in the scientific community, it has achieved popular appeal since the publication of Descent of Woman in 1972, and now has a growing band of scientists who are open to it and are investigating some of the ideas Elaine wrote about. Elaine's work has received warm comments from several prominent people. Philosopher Daniel Dennett wrote of the criticisms of her... \\"Many of the counterarguments seem awfully thin and ad hoc. During the last few years when I have found myself in the company of distinguished biologists, evolutionary theorists, paleo-anthropologists, and other experts, I have often asked them just to tell me, please, exactly why Elaine Morgan must be wrong about the aquatic ape theory. I haven't yet had a reply worth mentioning, aside from those who admit, with a twinkle in their eyes, that they have often wondered the same thing.\\" And in a BBC/Discovery Channel Documentary, the famous South African anthropologist Phillip V. Tobias said... \\"I see Elaine Morgan, through her series of superbly written books, presenting a challenge to the scientists to take an interest in this thing, to look at the evidence dispassionately. Not to avert your gaze as though it were something you that you hadn't ought to hear about or hadn't ought to see.

The parkway, originally known as the Captree Causeway, connects West Islip on Long Island to the barrier beach islands, such as Captree Island, Jones Beach Island, and the western tip of Fire Island, to the south. It is designated New York State Route 908J (NY 908J), an unsigned reference route. Except south of NY 27A, the road, like most parkways in New York State, is limited to non-commercial traffic. Route description Robert Moses State Park The Fire Island Inlet Bridge carrying the causeway over the Fire Island Inlet as seen from Captree State Park The Robert Moses Causeway begins inside Robert Moses State Park, located on the western tip of Fire Island. From here, the highway heads north across the Fire Island Inlet on the Fire Island Inlet Bridge. On the north side of the inlet, the road changes from a two-lane undivided highway into a four-lane undivided highway as it enters Captree State Park and approaches a cloverleaf interchange with Ocean Parkway. The parkway becomes a five-lane divided highway with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes in the vicinity of the junction. The parkway then traverses the State Boat Channel Bridge by way of a -long bascule bridge modeled after the Mill Basin Drawbridge in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. The north foot of the bridge contains an unnumbered interchange to a private road on Captree Island, where the rest of the road is surrounded by protected land. On the section that crosses over the Great South Bay, via the Great South Bay Bridge, the New York City skyline can be faintly seen on a clear day. Originally a toll bridge, the remnants of the former toll plaza for the Great South Bay Bridge can be found on the north side in West Islip. At the cloverleaf interchange with NY 27A, the third northbound lane becomes the deceleration ramp, and from there the rest of the parkway is four lanes wide. The parkway soon takes a slight northeastern turn and later rises to move over Union Boulevard (County Route 50 or CR 50), the Montauk Branch of the Long Island Rail Road, and Orinoco Drive with no access to either roads. Instead, another cloverleaf interchange is available at NY 27\\\\. The road remains elevated as it crosses over Muncey Road and then runs along the west side of Casamento Park, before approaching its northern terminus at the interchange with the Southern State Parkway. The north-to-eastbound ramp to the Southern State and Heckscher State parkways contains an interchange of its own with CR 57 (Bay Shore Road), because that ramp's traffic misses the Southern State Parkway exit to CR 57. The other ramps exist on a partial cloverleaf just west of Bay Shore Road's interchange with the Southern State. History The first sprawling trestle crossing from West Islip to Captree Island was completed in 1951. The structure is in length with a middle clearance for boats of .National Bridge Inventory, a database compiled by the United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, available at www.nationalbridges.com. Accessed August 29, 2007. Originally, one lane was for southbound traffic and the other for northbound traffic. In a bridge opening ceremony, the first car to drive over the bridge was a Suffolk County Sheriff's Office patrol vehicle. In 1967, a new span was built next to the original bridge, carrying three lanes of northbound traffic. The original bridge was reconfigured to carry southbound traffic. The Fire Island Inlet span was completed in 1964. By 1985 a dual span was proposed to alleviate traffic, but it was never constructed. When first proposed in 1938, the span was to be a vertical-lift bridge with a design similar to that of the Marine Parkway‚ÄìGil Hodges Memorial Bridge.

Silverpoint, red chalk, and traces of black pencil on white-coated paper, Kunstmuseum Basel. Doris Stock Silverpoint (one of several types of metalpoint) is a traditional drawing technique first used by medieval scribes on manuscripts. History A silverpoint drawing is made by dragging a silver rod or wire across a surface, often prepared with gesso or primer. Silverpoint is one of several types of metalpoint used by scribes, craftsmen and artists since ancient times. Metalpoint styli were used for writing on soft surfaces (wax or bark), ruling and underdrawing on parchment, and drawing on prepared paper and panel supports. For drawing purposes, the essential metals used were lead, tin and silver. The softness of these metals made them effective drawing instruments. (Watrous, 1957) Goldsmiths also used metalpoint drawings to prepare their detailed, meticulous designs. Albrecht D√ºrer's father was one such craftsman who later taught his young son to draw in metalpoint, to such good effect that his 1484 Self-Portrait at the Age of 13 is still considered a masterpiece. In the late Gothic/early Renaissance era, silverpoint emerged as a fine line drawing technique. Not blunting as easily as lead or tin, and rendering precise detail, silverpoint was especially favored in Florentine and Flemish workshops. Silverpoint drawings of this era include model books and preparatory sheets for paintings. Artists who worked in silverpoint include Jan van Eyck, Leonardo da Vinci, Albrecht D√ºrer and Raphael. Cennino Cennini's \\"Il Libro dell'Arte\\" provides a window on the practice of silver and leadpoint drawing, as well as preparing metalpoint grounds, in the late 14th century (Thompson, 1933; Duval, et al., 2004). Susan Dorothea White's book Draw Like da Vinci (2006) describes the silverpoint technique of Leonardo da Vinci.White, Susan D. (2006). Draw Like da Vinci. London: Cassell Illustrated, pp.22-25, . As noted by Francis Ames-Lewis, drawing styles changed at the end of the 16th century, resulting in a decline for metalpoint. The discovery of graphite deposits at Seathwaite in Borrowdale, Cumbria, England in the early 1500s, and its increasing availability to artists in a pure, soft (and erasable) form hastened silverpoint's eclipse. Artists sought more gestural qualities, for which graphite, red and black chalk were better suited. Ink and wash drawings are also prevalent in the period. In addition, these other drawing techniques required less effort and were more forgiving than silver, which resists erasure and leaves a fainter line. Furthermore, the preparation of silverpoint supports, usually with hide glue with finely ground bone ash, was labor-intensive. Modern practitioners use zinc, pre-prepared acrylic-based grounds or titanium white tempera or marble dust as a ground. Natural chalks and charcoal have the advantage of producing immediate results on uncoated papers (Ames-Lewis, 2000). Dutch artists Hendrik Goltzius and Rembrandt maintained the silverpoint tradition into the 17th century, as it declined in other parts of Europe. Rembrandt made several silverpoints on prepared vellum, the best-known being the portrait of his wife Saskia, 1633 (KdZ1152, Berlin). Botanical artists and architects continued to use metalpoint because of its exact lines. However, artists who continued this tradition of fine line drawing, such as J. A. D. Ingres, turned to graphite, which gradually improved in quality and availability throughout Europe since the 17th century. Silverpoint was for practical purposes rendered obsolete by the 18th century (Reiche, 2005). There has however been a contemporary art revival among European and American artists and academies because the medium imposes considerable discipline in draughtsmanship since drawings cannot be erased or altered. Revival Artist's Wife, Edith Holman Hunt by William Holman Hunt, a founding member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. Birmingham Museum of Art. Joseph Meder (Das Buchlein vom Silberstift, 1909), Alphonse Legros, the Pre- Raphaelites and Joseph Stella helped revitalize the technique. Art historian Meder created interest in the traditional technique in Austria and Germany, while artist and teacher Legros did likewise in England. In the early 20th century, Stella was one of the few American artists working in this method on the East Coast of the United States. Stella explored the technique on zinc white gouache prepared grounds, often with crayon and other media. Stella's silverpoint oevre includes the 1921 portrait of Marcel Duchamp (MoMA, Katherine S. Dreier Bequest) (Haskell, 1994). On the West Coast Xavier Martinez, the Mexican-American artist who had studied in Paris at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in the late 1890s during the resurgence of interest in silverpoint, taught this technique at the California College of the Arts from 1909 to the late 1930s. An online facsimile of the entire text of Vol. 1 is posted on the Traditional Fine Arts Organization website (). The last known exhibition of Martinez‚Äôs silverpoints was in 1921 at the Print Room of San Francisco where critics praised his ‚Äúunusual‚Äù and ‚Äústrongly futuristic‚Äù action figures on an unconventional dark mottled ground as ‚Äúarchaic in execution ... terse, alert ... with a bit too much flesh.‚ÄùSan Francisco Chronicle, 13 February 1921, p. 8‚ÄìS. Berkeley Daily Gazette, 19 February 1921, p. 5. The Oakland Tribune: 20 February 1921, p. W‚Äì5; 27 February 1921, p. S‚Äì7. An exhibit, \\"The Fine Line: Drawing with Silver in America\\" was curated for the Norton Museum of Art, in 1985 by Bruce Weber. Characteristics A traditional silverpoint stylus is made with a small fine rod of silver, such as jeweler's wire, which is inserted into a wooden rod. Another design is a silver-tipped metal stylus with points on both ends. An example of this type is shown in Rogier van der Weyden's St. Luke Drawing the Virgin, ca. 1435‚Äì40 (Boston Museum of Fine Arts). For a contemporary stylus, jeweler's wire may be inserted into a pin vise or mechanical pencil (Watrous, 1957). The initial marks of silverpoint appear grey as other metalpoints, but silverpoint lines, when exposed to air, tarnish to a warm brown tone. The oxidation becomes perceptible over a period of several months. The speed of oxidation varies according to the level of pollution in the air. Historically, silverpoint styli ranged widely in composition from pure silver to heavily alloyed with copper (over 20% weight) (Duval, 2004; Reiche, 2004/2005; Watrous, 1957). In the Middle Ages, metalpoint was used directly on parchment for the underdrawing of illuminated manuscripts or model books. On uncoated parchment (and paper), silverpoint is particularly light in value. However, since the 14th century, silverpoint was used more successfully on prepared supports. A traditional ground may be prepared with a rabbit skin glue solution pigmented with bone ash, chalk and/or lead white. Contemporary grounds include acrylic gesso, gouache and commercially prepared claycoat papers. The slight tooth of the ground preparation takes a little of the silver as it is drawn across the surface. Silverpoint has encompassed a wide range of styles from D√ºrer's curvilinear precision to Rembrandt's gestural sketches. Silverpoint has also proven adaptable to modern styles. Thomas Wilmer Dewing's late 19th Century silverpoint portraits are essentially tonal, as are Paula Gerard's mid-20th- century abstract compositions. Gerard's \\"Vortex\\" (Fairweather Hardin Gallery) is an innovative combination of silverpoint, goldpoint and watercolor on casein-coated parchment (Weber, 1985). Old Master silverpoints are typically intimate in scale, recalling the technique's roots in manuscript illumination. However, modern artists have also utilized this fine line technique for works on an increasingly large scale. John Wilde's \\"The Great Autobiographical Silverpoint Drawing\\" (The Art Institute of Chicago 1986.8) which is 38 √ó 91\\", one of the largest modern silverpoints. Silverpoint was also used in conjunction with other metal points by 20th-century artists. Pedro Joseph de Lemos, the Director of the San Francisco Art Institute from 1911 to 1917, popularized his ‚Äútechniques‚Äù in California art schools with his published instructions on the easy fabrication of various types of metal points that would react with inexpensive coated paper.. In his The Last of the Old Woodstock Inn, 1968 (The Art Institute of Chicago), Ivan Le Lorraine Albright used silver with platinum, gold, copper and brasspoint on commercially prepared video media paper. Contemporary artists continue to push the boundaries of this ancient drawing technique. Contemporary American silverpoint artist Carol Prusa combines graphite and binder on acrylic hemispheres with metal leaf, video projection and fiber optics.https://www.cnn.com/style/article/carol-prusa-dark-light-exhibition- scn/index.html Susan Schwalb has combined smoke and fire in silver and copperpoints in the 1980s and currently creates drawings and paintings using numerous metals as well as acrylic paint.Weber, Bruce et al.

History The party was formed at a congress in 1971, through the merger of the Revolutionary Marxists (RM) and the Bolshevik Group (BG). Initially it was called League of Revolutionary Marxists (, RMF). One section of RM did not agree with the formation of RM and formed the Communist Working Groups (KAG). KAG would later reconcile with RMF, merging into it in 1972. At the fifth party congress, held in 1975, the name was changed to Communist Workers League (Kommunistiska Arbetarf√∂rbundet). In 1982, the party adopted its current name. In the early 1990s, the party suffered a small split that went on to form the Swedish section of the Pathfinder tendency. In 1994, a smaller group left the SP to form a Swedish section of what is now the League for the Fifth International, Arbetarmakt. The party publishes the weekly paper Internationalen. It is currently not represented in local office. As of 2019, the party has been reorganized from a political party into an ideological organization, and calls for its members to vote for the Left Party.

In 1970, the Science Fiction Writers of America selected it as one of the best science-fiction short stories published before 1965, and it was therefore included in The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929‚Äì1964. The story has been widely anthologized and dramatized. Summary The story takes place entirely aboard an Emergency Dispatch Ship (EDS) headed for the frontier planet Woden with a load of desperately-needed medical supplies. The pilot, Barton, discovers a stowaway: an eighteen-year-old girl. By law, all EDS stowaways are to be jettisoned because EDS vessels carry no more fuel than is absolutely necessary to land safely at their destination. The girl, Marilyn, merely wants to see her brother Gerry and was not aware of the law. When boarding the EDS, Marilyn saw the \\"UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL KEEP OUT!\\" sign, but thought she would at most have to pay a fine if she were caught. Barton explains that her presence dooms the mission by exceeding the weight limit, and the subsequent crash would kill both of them and doom the colonists awaiting the medical supplies. After contacting her brother for the last moments of her life, Marilyn willingly walks into the airlock and is ejected into space. Reception Critic and engineer Gary Westfahl has said that because the proposition depends upon systems that were built without enough margin for error, the story is good physics, but lousy engineering, and that it frustrated him so much he decided it was \\"not worth (his) time. Very poor Engineering.\\"\\"Cosmic Engineers: A Study of Hard Science Fiction\\", by Gary Westfahl; Praeger, 1996 Writer Cory Doctorow has made a similar argument, noting that the constraints under which the characters operate are decided by the writers, and not therefore the \\"inescapable laws of physics\\". He argues that the decision of the writer to give the vessel no margin of safety and a marginal fuel supply focuses reader attention on the \\"need\\" for tough decisions in time of crisis and away from the responsibility for proper planning to ensure safety in the first place. Doctorow sees this as an example of moral hazard. Writer Don Sakers' short story \\"The Cold Solution\\" (Analog, July 1991), which debunks the premise, received the 1992 Analog Analytical Laboratory award as the readers' favorite Analog short story of 1991. In 1999, Richard Harter wrote a detailed analysis of the story online, with special attention to the possible negligence of those who designed the situation such that dilemmas like this could occur, and how this paralleled similar concerns involving industrial safety legislation.https://web.archive.org/web/20131208103213/http://www.richardhartersworld.com/cri_d/cri/1999/coldeq.html (Internet archive) The story was shaped by Astounding editor John W. Campbell, who sent \\"Cold Equations\\" back to Godwin three times before he got the version he wanted, because \\"Godwin kept coming up with ingenious ways to save the girl!\\"\\"Our Five Days with John W. Campbell\\", by Joe Green, The Bulletin of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Fall 2006, No. 171, page 13 In a 2019 essay in Locus, author Cory Doctorow criticized Campbell's decision as one to turn the story \\"into a parable about the foolishness of women and the role of men in guiding them to accept the cold, hard facts of life.\\" Similar concept in earlier stories The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction points to Robert Cromie's \\"A Plunge into Space\\" from 1890 as having a plot very similar to \\"The Cold Equations\\", and the theme of Feldstein's story is itself similar to the story \\"Precedent\\", published by E. C. Tubb in 1949. As in \\"The Cold Equations\\", a stowaway must be ejected from a spaceship because the fuel aboard is only enough for the planned passengers.Encyclopedia of Science Fiction David Drake stated \\"The plot is lifted directly from \\"A Weighty Decision,\\" a story in the May‚ÄìJune, 1952, issue of the EC comic Weird Science. I don't believe that coincidence could have created plots so similar in detail.\\" and ends with \\"The plot is such an obvious steal from the comic that I think Godwin would have concealed it better if he hadn't intended to use a completely different ending. I can also imagine that Godwin wouldn't have expressed his qualms at changing the ending to Campbell, who wouldn't have winked at direct plagiarism. (Not that EC had any legitimate gripe: Bill Gaines laughed in later years about the way he and his staff at EC stole plots from SF stories and ran them without credit.)\\"Godwin, Tom (2003) The Cold Equations & Other Stories \\"Afterword: Sometime It All Works\\" Adaptations The story has been adapted for television at least three times: as part of the 1962 British anthology series Out of This World starring Peter Wyngarde and Jane Asher; as part of the 1985‚Äì1989 revival of The Twilight Zone (\\"The Cold Equations\\") and again in 1996 as a made-for-television film starring Billy Campbell and Poppy Montgomery on the Sci-Fi Channel. The story was also adapted into an episode of the radio program X Minus One in 1955, an episode of the radio program Exploring Tomorrow in 1958, in which the girl was trying to visit her husband to make amends for an affair she had. It was featured as a part of Faster Than Light on CBC Radio's Sunday Showcase in September 2002 by Joe Mahoney (hosted by science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer).

Life Maria Stella Petronilla Chiappini was born to an ordinary Italian family in 1773, in a small village called Modigliana in Tuscany. According to Maria's autobiography, she was treated poorly by her mother as a child, while her brothers and sisters gained all the attention. Years later after the death of her father, who had sent her a letter confessing that he was indeed not her biological father, she understood the treatment that she had been given by her mother and the Countess Camilla Borghi's kindness towards her. Maria Stella, the supposed daughter of Chiappini, went on the stage at Florence, where her putative parents had settled, and there at the age of thirteen became the wife of the first Lord Newborough, after whose death she married in 1810 the Estonian Count Eduard Ungern- Sternberg.http://daten.digitale- sammlungen.de/~db/bsb00000600/images/index.html?id=00000600&groesser;=&seite;=474 On the death of her putative father in 1821 she received a letter, written by him shortly before his death, in which he confessed that she was not his daughter, adding \\"Heaven has repaired my fault, since you are in a better position than your real father, though he was of almost similar rank\\" (i.e. a French nobleman). Maria Stella henceforward devoted her time and fortune to establishing her identity. Her first success was the judgment of the episcopal court at Faenza, which in 1824 declared that the Comte Louis de Joinville exchanged his daughter for the son of Lorenzo Chiappini, and that the Demoiselle de Joinville had been baptized as Maria Stella, with the false statement that she was the daughter of L Chiappini and his wife. The discovery that Joinville was a countship of the Orl√©ans family, and a real or fancied resemblance of Louis Philippe to Chiappini, convinced her that the duke of Orleans was the person for whose sake she had been cheated of her birthright, a conviction strengthened by the striking resemblance which many people discovered in her to the princesses of the Orl√©ans family. In 1830 she published her proofs under the title Maria Stella ou un √©change d'une demoiselle du plus haut rang contre un gar√ßon de plus vile condition (reprinted 1839 and 1849). This coincided with the advent of Louis Philippe to the throne, and her claim became a weapon for those who wished to throw discredit and ridicule on the bourgeois monarch. He for his part treated the whole thing with amused contempt, and Baroness Newborough-Sternburg de Joinville, or Marie √âtoile d'Orl√©ans, as she called herself, was suffered to live in Paris until on 23 December 1843 she died in poverty and obscurity. Analysis In spite of much discussion and investigation, the case of Maria Stella remains one of the unsolved problems of history but which could be solved today by DNA as there are direct descendants of all those involved.Sir Ralph Payne Gallwey's Mystery of Maria Stella, Lady Newborough (London, 1907), is founded on her own accounts and argues in favour of her point of view. An alternative view is Maurice Vitrac's Philippe-Egalit√© et M. Chiappini (Paris, 1907), which is based on unpublished material in the Archives nationales. Vitrac seeks to overthrow Maria Stella's case by an alibi. The duke and duchess of Chartres could not have been at Modigliana in April 1773, for the simple reason that they can be proved at that time to have been in Paris. On 8 April the duke, according to the official Gazette de France, took part in the Maundy Thursday ceremonies at Versailles; from 7 April to 14 April he was in constant attendance at the lodge of Freemasons of which he had just been elected grand master. Moreover, it was impossible for the first prince of the blood royal to leave France without the royal permission, and his absence would certainly have been remarked. Lastly, the duchess's accouchement, a semi-public function in the case of royal princesses, did not take place till 6 October. Vitrac identifies the real father of Maria Stella with Count Carlo Battaglini of Rimini, who died in 1796 without issue; the case being not one of substitution, but of ordinary farming out to avoid a scandal. Legacy In 2017 the city council of Modigliana set up a programme of events to commemorate the figure of Maria Stella, including conferences, lectures, studies and a theatre historical drama written and directed by L.A. Mazzoni and played by actors of Filodrammatica Berton. There is now a plaque commemorating the event on the Palazzo Pretorio where the exchange is alleged to have taken place. It consists of a relief with figures of the Count and Countess of Joinville and Lorenzo and Vincentia Chiappini handing babies to each other. References * Further reading * Lady Newborough.

The museum was established in 1993, as the educational arm of human rights organization, the Simon Wiesenthal Center. MOT also deals with atrocities in Cambodia and Latin America, along with issues like bullying and hate crimes. The MOT has an associated museum and professional development multi-media training facility in New York City. The Museum is closed on Saturdays (Sabbath), the Jewish day of rest.  Los Angeles  The original museum in Los Angeles, California opened in 1993. It was built at a cost of $50 million by the Simon Wiesenthal Center, named after its founder Simon Wiesenthal, a Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter. The museum receives 350,000 visitors annually, about a third of which are school-age children. The museum's most talked-about exhibit is \\"The Holocaust Section\\", where visitors are divided into groups to take their own place in some of the events of World War II. These experiences are then discussed afterwards. The museum also features testimonies of Holocaust survivors, often from live volunteers who tell their stories and answer questions. People also get cards with pictures of Jewish children on them and at the end of the museum trip, it is revealed whether the child on the card survived or was murdered in the Holocaust. Protesting L.A. museum expansion In addition, the museum features a \\"Tolerancenter\\" that discusses issues of prejudice in everyday life, a Multimedia Learning Center, Finding Our Families ‚Äì Finding Ourselves, a collection of archives and documents, various temporary exhibits such as Los Angeles visual artist Bill Cormalis Jr's \\"A\\" Game In The B Leagues,\\" which documents through paintings, the Civil Rights Movement during the segregation of colored people in Major League Baseball, and an Arts and Lectures Program. A classroom visit to the museum is featured in the 2007 movie Freedom Writers, based on the real-life story of high school teacher Erin Gruwell and her students. The museum was parodied in an episode of South Park called \\"The Death Camp of Tolerance\\".  History  In February 1993, the Museum opened, which carries the mission to not only remind us of the past, but remind us to act. Today over 350,000 people visit the Museum annually, including 110,000 children.  Education  The Museum runs a program called The Museums Tools for Tolerance (r) for Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Professional. Through its inception in 1996, it has trained over 75,000 law enforcement officers. The success of the program led to the creation of the New York Tolerance Center.  Criticism  The museum has been criticized for providing a one-sided view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Wendy Brown, describing the \\"Zionist political agenda of the Wiesenthal Center\\", wrote in 2009: She also criticized the Museum for its cavalier attitude towards prejudice and genocide directed at non-Jewish groups: But she also thought that the experience of the museum could make its visitors more vigilant against social prejudice and stereotyping: In 2003, the Museum was criticized for not featuring any exhibit about the Armenian genocide, despite Hier having promised that in 1985. Oren Baruch Stier, who specializes in Holocaust and Jewish studies, criticized the museum for not contextualizing the Holocaust.

He is married to game programmer Anne Westfall, and they work together as Free Fall Associates. Free Fall is best known for Archon: The Light and the Dark, one of the earliest titles from Electronic Arts. Career =Automated Simulations and Epyx= Freeman worked as a game designer for video game developer and publisher, Epyx, which he co-founded with Jim Connelley in 1978 as Automated Simulations. Their first game, Starfleet Orion, was a two-player only game developed mainly so Connelley could write off the cost of his Commodore PET computer. Freeman provided design while Connelley handled the programming in BASIC. Freeman was amazed when they actually had a finished product and they had to create a company to publish it. So, both he and Connelley fell into the computer game industry by accident. It was while with this company, still known as Automated Simulations in 1980, that Freeman met his future wife, Anne Westfall, at a computer fair. Starfleet Orion was quickly followed by Invasion Orion. What followed was a slew of very successful titles for various platforms. Freeman designed or co-designed a number of Epyx games, such as Crush, Crumble and Chomp! and Rescue at Rigel. Freeman tired of what he called \\"office politics\\" and yearned to get away from the now much larger company. =The Complete Book of Wargames= In 1980, Freeman, in collaboration with the editors of Consumer Guide, wrote The Complete Book of Wargames, which was published by Simon & Schuster under their \\"Fireside\\" imprint. In the book, Freeman, explained the history of wargames to that point, the notable companies, the usual components, and evaluated most of the major wargames in print at the time, as well as the role that computer games would play in this field. =Free Fall Associates= In 1981, Freeman and Anne Westfall left Epyx to create Free Fall Associates along with game designer Paul Reiche III. Free Falls' first game was 1982's Tax Dodge, which remained obscure. Free Fall went on to develop two highly acclaimed games published by Electronic Arts: Archon and Archon II: Adept. Originally written for the Atari 8-bit family, they were ported to other contemporary home computers. Free Fall developed a few more titles after Archon II, but nothing as well-known. Freeman is credited with some recent development work with Square Enix.

It can streamline a business for simplicity, achieve digital transformation, increase service quality, improve service delivery or contain costs. It consists of integrating applications, restructuring labor resources and using software applications throughout the organization. Robotic process automation is an emerging field within BPA that uses artificial intelligence. Deployment BPAs can be implemented in a number of business areas including marketing, sales and workflow. Toolsets vary in sophistication, but there is an increasing trend towards the use of artificial intelligence technologies that can understand natural language and unstructured data sets, interact with human beings, and adapt to new types of problems without human-guided training. BPA providers tend to focus on different industry sectors but their underlying approach tends to be similar in that they will attempt to provide the shortest route to automation by exploiting the user interface layer rather than going deeply into the application code or databases sitting behind them. They also simplify their own interface to the extent that these tools can be used directly by non- technically qualified staff. The main advantage of these toolsets is therefore their speed of deployment, the drawback is that it brings yet another IT supplier to the organization. The market is, however, evolving in this area. In order to automate these processes, connectors are needed to fit these systems/solutions together with a data exchange layer to transfer the information. A process driven messaging service is an option for optimizing your data exchange layer. By mapping your end-to-end process workflow, you can build an integration between individual platforms using a process driven messaging platform. Process driven messaging service gives you the logic to build your process by using triggers, jobs and workflows. Some companies uses an API where you build workflow/s and then connect various systems or mobile devices. You build the process, creating workflows in the API where the workflow in the API acts as a data exchange layer. A business process management implementation A business process management system is quite different from BPA. However, it is possible to build automation on the back of a BPM implementation. The actual tools to achieve this vary, from writing custom application code to using specialist BPA tools. The advantages and disadvantages of this approach are inextricably linked ‚Äì the BPM implementation provides an architecture for all processes in the business to be mapped, but this in itself delays the automation of individual processes and so benefits may be lost in the meantime. Robotic process automation The practice of performing robotic process automation (RPA) results in the deployment of attended or unattended software agents to an organization's environment. These software agents, or robots, are deployed to perform pre- defined structured and repetitive sets of business tasks or processes: The goal is for humans to focus on more productive tasks, while the software agents handle the repetitive ones, such as billing. Artificial intelligence software robots are deployed to handle unstructured data sets (like images, texts, audios) and are deployed after performing and deploying robotic process automation: They can, for instance, populate an automatic transcript from a video. The combination of automation and intelligence (AI) brings autonomy for the robots, along with the capability in mastering cognitive tasks: At this stage, the robot is able to learn and improve the processes by analyzing and adapting them. Robotic process automation is the leading gateway for the adoption of artificial intelligence in business environments .

The patterned carvings are thought to represent wooden roof shingles. Hogbacks are stone carved Anglo-Scandinavian sculptures from 10th- to 12th-century England and Scotland. Singular hogbacks were found in Ireland and Wales. Hogbacks fell out of fashion by the beginning of the 11th century. Their function is generally accepted as grave markers. Geography and description Hogbacks take the form of recumbent monuments, generally with a curved ('hogbacked') ridge, often also with outwardly curved sides. This shape, and the fact that they are frequently decorated with 'shingles' on either side of the central ridge, show that they are stylised 'houses' for the dead. The 'house' is of a Scandinavian type. One theory is that hogbacks originated among the Danish settlers who occupied northern England in the 870s after the fall of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. However, there is not sufficient research to prove or disprove this. It has been suggested that the monument-type was invented about 920. There are particular concentrations of hogbacks in Yorkshire, Cumbria, and Govan on the River Clyde ‚Äì the first being their likely area of origin. Individual examples are found over a much wider area, however, from Derbyshire to Central Scotland. The presence of hogbacks in Scotland is likely due to the Forth- Clyde route, which connected York, England to Dublin. Most hogback sites in Scotland are along maritime routes. English hogback sites do not follow this same trajectory. There are stray examples as far afield as the Northern Isles, Orkney and Cornwall.In the churchyard of Lanivet is a rare example of a hogback grave dating from Viking times. Ireland has a single example at Castledermot, County Kildare, which is similar to two hogbacks in Ingleby Arncliffe, North Yorkshire. Wales also has a single example at Llanddewi Aberarth Church. The most numerous collections are the ones preserved in St Thomas's church at Brompton, North Yorkshire. Discovered in 1867 following the restoration of the church, six were taken to Durham Cathedral Library, leaving four whole ones and fragments of others at Brompton. They are characterized by carvings of bears hugging the slabs with strapwork in their mouths. Elsewhere five are in the parish kirk of Govan, once a rural parish, but now part of Glasgow. There is a fine example in the visitor centre on Inchcolm island in the Firth of Forth. Typology There are two main types of Hogbacks. One is the Brompton type, which is characterized by massive end beasts. The other type is the warrior's tomb, which looks more like a house. It does not have massive end beasts.Bailey, R. N. (1980). Viking Age Sculpture in Northern England, London: Collins Archaeology Within the two main groups of hogback styles are smaller subsets. The scroll type hogback is a subset of the warrior's tomb type. It is characterized by scroll motifs on the horizontal band below the tegulation.Lang, James T. \\"Hogback monuments in Scotland.\\" In Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 105, 1972, pp. 206-235. Hogbacks at Govan Govan sits on the south bank of the Clyde River. It has the four largest known hogbacks. There are five hogbacks at Govan Parish Church. The earliest has been dated to the mid-tenth century. It has two rows of tegulation with concave, contoured lines. It has a band of interlace beneath the rows of shingles. The interlace pattern is not the same on either side. It is not continuous on either side. This is the only hogback at Govan with stopped-plait interlacing. The stopped plait on this hogback is characterized by a series of small, separated elements with pellet fillers. It also has a running ring-knot interlace with frets. On the other side, the sections of four-cord plait are stylistically reduced to a contoured diagonal bar crossed with a bar and four small pellets flanking it. The later four hogbacks at Govan are dated to the end of the 10th century. The longest hogback at Govan does not have the decorative motifs that its earlier brother has. It is covered in rows of shingles, but they are not contoured. It is wider with a shallower roof pitch. The third hogback is massive. It has a full-bodied, 3-dimensional end-beast with legs. This single animal straddles the monument from one end to the other. The fourth hogback is also characterized by a single end-beast. Its head faces outward, an uncommon feature in hogbacks. The animal's four bent legs point toward its head. The roof ridges resemble a spine and the rows of tegulation are like scales. The fifth hogback has two end-beasts, one at either end. The beasts' faces and bodies are shown in profile with jaws gaping open, their legs intersecting along the base. This is the only known hogback with end-beasts in this position.

Harvard Business Review January 2007 Kotter However this is a relatively narrow definition that overlooks other reasons and ignores other rationales. A better understanding is achieved by considering that \\"Transformation ... is generally a response to two things. First, there are underlying problems or causes of organisational pain that need to be addressed. They have to be properly understood but nevertheless they are a key component. Second, there is a desire by the top management and other senior stakeholders to use the opportunity of addressing these causes in ways that fundamentally alter the paradigm of the organisation.\\" Others describe Business Transformation as \\"the process of fundamentally changing the systems, processes, people and technology across a whole business or business unit. As such, a business transformation project is likely to include any number of change management projects, each focused on an individual process, system, technology, team or department.\\" When business transformation is used The need for business transformation may be caused by external changes in the market such as an organisation's products or services being out of date, funding or income streams being changed, new regulations coming into force or market competition becoming more intense. This management approach may also incorporate Business Process Reengineering:McKinsey Survey 2010 However application of BPR does not of itself constitute a business transformation, the outcome should be the deciding factor as to whether any activity is truly transformational or simply improvement. Other methods like Lean or Six Sigma are rooted in incremental improvement rather than paradigm shifts in the way things are done. * to increase revenue or market share * to improve customer satisfaction * to cut costs Components Business transformation is achieved by one or more of: realigning the way staff work, how the organisation is structured, the core product or service portfolio of the business and how technology is used. Typically organisations go through several stages in transforming themselves:Harvard Business Review January 2007 Kotter * recognising the need to change and gaining consensus amongst stakeholders that change is necessary * agreeing what form the change should take, the objectives of the change and a vision that describes a better future * understanding what the organization is changing from and what needs to change in detail * designing the new organisational way of working and its support and management * testing and implementing changes, usually in waves (this may take place over a number of years) * bedding in the change so that the organisation cannot move back to how it was and achieves the intended benefits.

He played a central role in the First Anglo-Afghan War of 1838‚Äì1842. His biography of Dost Mohammad Khan, the emir of Kabul, is a primary source on the War. His wife Hyderi Begum was a Muslim scholar. During the Indian Mutiny in 1857, she maintained a day book recording the happenings and events in Delhi. Her diary was later seized and confiscated by the British government.  Early Life and Family  Mohan Lal (also called Ram Nath) was from a family of Kashmiri Pandits. His great grandfather, Pandit Mani Ram, had a high rank at the Mughal Court in the reign of Shah Alam II. His father, Rai Brahm Nath, also known as Budh Singh, worked for a time for Mountstuart Elphinstone. Mohan Lal studied at the Delhi College, one of the first Indian students to be educated in the English curriculum there. His only brother, Kedar Nath Zutshi, was a Deputy Collector in Ambala, Panjab Province, and died in 1855.  Travels with Burnes  In 1831 Lieutenant (later Captain) Sir Alexander Burnes of the East India Company's service was deputed by the British Government to gather information in the countries lying between India and the Caspian. He was directed to appear as a private individual with a small retinue maintaining a character of poverty. Mohan Lal was engaged by Burnes primarily to assist him in his Persian correspondence and also because Burnes believed that his youth and creed would free him from all danger of his entering into intrigues with the people among whom he was going to travel. Alexander Burnes and Mohan Lal led an expedition to Central Asia in 1832-4 for procuring political and military intelligence and became firm friends.  Anglo-Afghan war  Later, Mohan Lal was the Commercial Agent for the British on the Indus and Political Assistant to Burnes in Kabul during the first Afghan War. Unlike Burnes, he survived the massacres of 1841 and continued to keep Calcutta informed of events in the Afghan capital from the house of a merchant where he had taken refuge. His reports contained many strong and cogent criticisms of the behaviour of British Officers, and particularly Sir William Hay Macnaghten and General William Elphinstone. Mohan Lal had learned Persian in Delhi and travelled in the garb of a Muslim, under the pseudonym of 'Aga Hassan Kashmiri' or as 'Mirza Quli Kashmiri' in Persia and Afghanistan collecting information vital for his British superiors. During the First Anglo-Afghan war, he was instrumental in setting up and expanding the British intelligence network in Afghanistan and is also alleged to have had a major hand in arranging the assassination, by poisoning, of Mir Masjidi Khan, a major Afghan resistance leader.Lady Florentia Sale, Journal of the Disasters in Afghanistan, 1841-42, 1843, p.141 He found out and handed over to the British authorities secret letters written by the rulers of Kandahar to Mehrab Khan, the ruler of Baluchistan, exhorting him not to allow passage to the invading British army. He managed to obtain the services of very important functionaries like Mohammed Tahir, Haji Khan Kakari, Abdul Majeed Khan, Akhundzada Ghulam and Mullah Nasooh in Kandahar and Sardar Abdul Rashid Khan, a nephew of the Emir Sardar Dost Mohammad Khan in Ghazni. He played a major role in securing the release of British prisoners held hostage in Bamiyan. He tried to bring peace between the British and the Afghans during such inflammatory situations.  Later Life  After the war, Mohan Lal travelled to Europe, meeting Queen Victoria, and Frederick William IV of Prussia. During his travels in Europe, Mohan Lal was photographed in 1844 by Robert Adamson and David Octavius Hill. Today his photo is contained in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Mohan Lal Zutshi retired at the age of 32, disappointed that he had not been properly rewarded for his contributions to the British cause in the First Anglo-Afghan War. His later years were spent in obscurity and financial troubles. According to biographer Hari Ram Gupta, Mohan Lal is reported to have written an extensive diary until his death, but by 1943 its location was no longer known.

An \\\\mathbb{N}-graded vector space, often called simply a graded vector space without the prefix \\\\mathbb{N}, is a vector space V together with a decomposition into a direct sum of the form : V = \\\\bigoplus_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} V_n where each V_n is a vector space. For a given n the elements of V_n are then called homogeneous elements of degree n. Graded vector spaces are common. For example the set of all polynomials in one or several variables forms a graded vector space, where the homogeneous elements of degree n are exactly the linear combinations of monomials of degree n. General I-graded vector spaces The subspaces of a graded vector space need not be indexed by the set of natural numbers, and may be indexed by the elements of any set I. An I-graded vector space V is a vector space together with a decomposition into a direct sum of subspaces indexed by elements i of set the I: : V = \\\\bigoplus_{i \\\\in I} V_i. Therefore, an \\\\mathbb{N}-graded vector space, as defined above, is just an I-graded vector space where the set I is \\\\mathbb{N} (the set of natural numbers). The case where I is the ring \\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z} (the elements 0 and 1) is particularly important in physics. A (\\\\mathbb{Z}/2\\\\mathbb{Z})-graded vector space is also known as a supervector space. Homomorphisms For general index sets I, a linear map between two I-graded vector spaces is called a graded linear map if it preserves the grading of homogeneous elements. A graded linear map is also called a homomorphism (or morphism) of graded vector spaces, or homogeneous linear map: :f(V_i)\\\\subseteq W_i for all i in I. For a fixed field and a fixed index set, the graded vector spaces form a category whose morphisms are the graded linear maps. When I is a commutative monoid (such as the natural numbers), then one may more generally define linear maps that are homogeneous of any degree i in I by the property :f(V_j)\\\\subseteq W_{i+j} for all j in I, where \\"+\\" denotes the monoid operation. If moreover I satisfies the cancellation property so that it can be embedded into a commutative group A that it generates (for instance the integers if I is the natural numbers), then one may also define linear maps that are homogeneous of degree i in A by the same property (but now \\"+\\" denotes the group operation in A). Specifically, for i in I a linear map will be homogeneous of degree ‚àíi if :f(V_{i+j})\\\\subseteq W_j for all j in I, while :f(V_j)=0\\\\, if is not in I. Just as the set of linear maps from a vector space to itself forms an associative algebra (the algebra of endomorphisms of the vector space), the sets of homogeneous linear maps from a space to itself, either restricting degrees to I or allowing any degrees in the group A, form associative graded algebras over those index sets. Operations on graded vector spaces Some operations on vector spaces can be defined for graded vector spaces as well. Given two I-graded vector spaces V and W, their direct sum has underlying vector space V ‚äï W with gradation :(V ‚äï W)i = Vi ‚äï Wi . If I is a semigroup, then the tensor product of two I-graded vector spaces V and W is another I-graded vector space, V \\\\otimes W with gradation : (V \\\\otimes W)_i = \\\\bigoplus_{\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\left(j,k\\\\right)j+k=i\\\\right\\\\\\\\}} V_j \\\\otimes W_k.

Proved by Karl Menger in 1927, it characterizes the connectivity of a graph. It is generalized by the max-flow min-cut theorem, which is a weighted, edge version, and which in turn is a special case of the strong duality theorem for linear programs. Edge connectivity The edge-connectivity version of Menger's theorem is as follows: :Let G be a finite undirected graph and x and y two distinct vertices. Then the size of the minimum edge cut for x and y (the minimum number of edges whose removal disconnects x and y) is equal to the maximum number of pairwise edge-independent paths from x to y. :Extended to all pairs: a graph is k-edge-connected (it remains connected after removing fewer than k edges) if and only if every pair of vertices has k edge-disjoint paths in between. Vertex connectivity The vertex-connectivity statement of Menger's theorem is as follows: :Let G be a finite undirected graph and x and y two nonadjacent vertices. Then the size of the minimum vertex cut for x and y (the minimum number of vertices, distinct from x and y, whose removal disconnects x and y) is equal to the maximum number of pairwise internally vertex-disjoint paths from x to y. :Extended to all pairs: a graph is k-vertex-connected (it has more than k vertices and it remains connected after removing fewer than k vertices) if and only if every pair of vertices has at least k internally vertex-disjoint paths in between. All these statements (in both edge and vertex versions) remain true in directed graphs (when considering directed paths). Short proof Most direct proofs consider a more general statement to allow proving it by induction. It is also convenient to use definitions that include some degenerate cases. The following proof for undirected graphs works without change for directed graphs or multi-graphs, provided we take path to mean directed path. For sets of vertices A,B ‚äÇ G (not necessarily disjoint), an AB-path is a path in G with a starting vertex in A, a final vertex in B, and no internal vertices in A or B. We allow a path with a single vertex in A ‚à© B and zero edges. An AB-separator of size k is a set S of k vertices (which may intersect A and B) such that G‚àíS contains no AB-path. An AB-connector of size k is a union of k vertex-disjoint AB-paths. : Theorem: The minimum size of an AB-separator is equal to the maximum size of an AB- connector. In other words, if no k‚àí1 vertices disconnect A from B, then there exist k disjoint paths from A to B. This variant implies the above vertex- connectivity statement: for x,y ‚àà G in the previous section, apply the current theorem to G‚àí{x,y} with A = N(x), B = N(y), the neighboring vertices of x,y. Then a set of vertices disconnecting x and y is the same thing as an AB- separator, and removing the end vertices in a set of independent xy-paths gives an AB-connector. Proof of the Theorem:F. G√∂ring, Short Proof of Menger's Theorem, Discrete Mathematics 219 (2000) 295-296.) Induction on the number of edges in G. For G with no edges, the minimum AB-separator is A ‚à© B, which is itself an AB-connector consisting of single-vertex paths. For G having an edge e, we may assume by induction that the Theorem holds for G‚àíe. If G‚àíe has a minimal AB-separator of size k, then there is an AB-connector of size k in G‚àíe, and hence in G. An illustration for the proof. Otherwise, let S be a AB- separator of G‚àíe of size less than k, so that every AB-path in G contains a vertex of S or the edge e. The size of S must be k-1, since if it was less, S together with either endpoint of e would be a better AB-separator of G. In G‚àíS there is an AB-path through e, since S alone is too small to be an AB- separator of G. Let v1 be the earlier and v2 be the later vertex of e on such a path. Then v1 is reachable from A but not from B in G‚àíS‚àíe, while v2 is reachable from B but not from A. Now, let S1 = S ‚à™ {v1}, and consider a minimum AS1-separator T in G‚àíe. Since v2 is not reachable from A in G‚àíS1, T is also an AS1-separator in G. Then T is also an AB-separator in G (because every AB-path intersects S1). Hence it has size at least k. By induction, G‚àíe contains an AS1-connector C1 of size k. Because of its size, the endpoints of the paths in it must be exactly S1. Similarly, letting S2 = S ‚à™ {v2}, a minimum S2B-separator has size k, and there is an S2B-connector C2 of size k, with paths whose starting points are exactly S2. Furthermore, since S1 disconnects G, every path in C1 is internally disjoint from every path in C2, and we can define an AB-connector of size k in G by concatenating paths (k‚àí1 paths through S and one path going through e=v1v2). Q.E.D.  Other proofs  The directed edge version of the theorem easily implies the other versions. To infer the directed graph vertex version, it suffices to split each vertex v into two vertices v1, v2, with all ingoing edges going to v1, all outgoing edges going from v2, and an additional edge from v1 to v2. The directed versions of the theorem immediately imply undirected versions: it suffices to replace each edge of an undirected graph with a pair of directed edges (a digon). The directed edge version in turn follows from its weighted variant, the max-flow min-cut theorem. Its proofs are often correctness proofs for max flow algorithms. It is also a special case of the still more general (strong) duality theorem for linear programs. A formulation that for finite digraphs is equivalent to the above formulation is: : Let A and B be sets of vertices in a finite digraph G. Then there exists a family P of disjoint AB-paths and an AB- separating set that consists of exactly one vertex from each path in P. In this version the theorem follows in fairly easily from K√∂nig's theorem: in a bipartite graph, the minimal size of a cover is equal to the maximal size of a matching. This is done as follows: replace every vertex v in the original digraph D by two vertices v' , v, and every edge uv by the edge u'v. This results in a bipartite graph, whose one side consists of the vertices v' , and the other of the vertices v. Applying K√∂nig's theorem we obtain a matching M and a cover C of the same size. In particular, exactly one endpoint of each edge of M is in C. Add to C all vertices a, for a in A, and all vertices b' , for b in B. Let P be the set of all AB-paths composed of edges uv in D such that u'v belongs to M. Let Q in the original graph consist of all vertices v such that both v' and v belong to C. It is straightforward to check that Q is an AB-separating set, that every path in the family P contains precisely one vertex from Q, and every vertex in Q lies on a path from P, as desired. Infinite graphs Menger's theorem holds for infinite graphs, and in that context it applies to the minimum cut between any two elements that are either vertices or ends of the graph . The following result of Ron Aharoni and Eli Berger was originally a conjecture proposed by Paul Erd≈ës, and before being proved was known as the Erd≈ës‚ÄìMenger conjecture. It is equivalent to Menger's theorem when the graph is finite. :Let A and B be sets of vertices in a (possibly infinite) digraph G. Then there exists a family P of disjoint A-B- paths and a separating set which consists of exactly one vertex from each path in P.

And sometimes when passing through, they found themselves brushing up against the secret names of truth.\\" Each story stars a new cast, and takes place in a different year, but is confined in the room 603 of the Railroad Hotel, located in New York City. The same bellboy and maid are featured in each story, as if they do not age.

Jay McInerney wrote and James Signorelli directed the second. The series was produced by Deepak Nayar, who had worked with Lynch on Wild at Heart, Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me and On the Air, and executive produced by Monty Montgomery and Lynch. This was Peter Deming's second collaboration as cinematographer with Lynch after On the Air. The music was composed, conducted and orchestrated by frequent Lynch collaborator Angelo Badalamenti, while Lynch was responsible for the sound design. According to Gifford, HBO were trying to emulate the success of the anthology series Tales from the Crypt, but \\"they wanted sexier or comedic pieces, not serious sex and not satire exactly, but something else.\\" Gifford wrote five scripts, of which HBO produced two. He retained the rights to all five of them, and has turned them into plays that have been performed in several states of the U.S. The teleplays for \\"Tricks\\" and \\"Blackout\\", along with the unproduced \\"Mrs. Kashfi\\", which was deemed too controversial by the network, have been published in a book by the University Press of Mississippi. \\"Blackout\\" was written in just two days, to replace a script by David Mamet that Montgomery wasn't satisfied with. Gifford's script was only 17 pages long, but Lynch's cut of it came in at 47 minutes, by far the longest of the three episodes. HBO aired a truncated version of it, but the VHS release contains the longer, and director's preferred, version. Episodes Release =Broadcast= Hotel Room was broadcast on HBO on January 8, 1993 at 11 pm, and again on January 9, at 12 pm. In its first broadcast, it rated first in its time slot on HBO. =Home media= The three episodes of the anthology has been released in VHS by Worldvision Enterprises. In Japan, a LaserDisc with English audio and burned-in Japanese subtitles has been released by Pony Canyon. Bootleg DVDs captured from either of these two sources also exist. Reception The New York Times wrote: \\"David Lynch has long raised suspicions that his work would be most at home on late-night television, but \\"Hotel Room\\" indicates otherwise. This setbound omnibus drama, produced by Mr. Lynch and featuring three weak episodes set in the New York City hotel room of the title, plays like a listless visit to a Lynch-style \\"Twilight Zone\\" where stories go nowhere, anecdotes are pointlessly bizarre and lame quips are echoed emptily, as if banality were a form of wit.\\" Newsday had a similar opinion: \\"Even if you're a diehard \\"Twin Peaks\\" freak who's incorrigibly wild at heart, you'll be itching to check out of this 90-minute trilogy (premiering tonight at 11) long before the door finally closes on the tedious doings in Room 603 of the Railroad Hotel in New York City.\\" Variety was a little more positive regarding the third episode: \\"With the exception of a fine performance by Alicia Witt and a few intriguing moments, the episodes are flat and wooden, lacking the fascinating darkness of Lynch's other work.\\" A more positive review was printed in the Los Angeles Times, which wrote that although it wouldn't become a hit, Lynch fans would enjoy it: \\"As you might expect with the talent involved, this is the \\"Grand Hotel\\" not quite so much of the twilight zone as of hell itself, definitely not for the tastes of typical travelers but a marvelously absorbing stay for the Lynch true- faithful, at least.\\" References External links * Hotel Room introduction, episode info, pictures, teleplay info at The City of Absurdity site  Hotel Room episode guide on AboutLynch.com * Hotel Room episode guide on AboutLynch.com Category:HBO original programming Category:1990s American drama television series Category:1993 American television series debuts Category:1993 American television series endings Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios Category:Television series created by David Lynch Category:English-language television shows Category:Films set in hotels ","title":"Hotel Room"},{"id":"1155806","text":"Christine N√∂stlinger (13 October 1936 ‚Äì 28 June 2018) was an Austrian writer best known for children's books.

Life and career N√∂stlinger was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1936. By her own admission, she was a wild and angry child. After finishing high school, she wanted to become an artist, and studied graphic arts at the Academy of Applied Arts in Vienna. She worked as a graphic artist for a few years, before marrying a journalist, Ernst N√∂stlinger, with whom she had two daughters. The majority of N√∂stlinger's production is literature for children and for young people, and she also writes for television, radio and newspapers. She centres on the needs of children in her work, with an anti- authoritarian bent. She does not shy away from tackling difficult subjects like racism, discrimination and self-isolation. Her first book was Die feuerrote Friederike, published in 1970, which she illustrated herself. The book was published in English in 1975 as Fiery Frederica.

It still possesses a two-fold literary interest, first as one of the most popular books of the time, and secondly as the source, directly or indirectly, of later literature, in Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, Giovanni Boccaccio, Thomas Hoccleve, William Shakespeare, and others. Of its authorship nothing certain is known. It is conjecture to associate it either with the name of Helinandus or with that of Petrus Berchorius (Pierre Bercheure). It is debated whether it originated in England, Germany or France. Content The work was evidently intended as a manual for preachers, and was probably written by one of the clerical profession. The name, Deeds of the Romans, is only partially appropriate to the collection in its present form, since, besides the titles from Greek and Latin history and legend, it comprises fragments of different origins, Asian and European. The unifying element of the book is its moral purpose, but the work contains a variety of material. It includes, for example: * the germ of the romance of Guy of Warwick; * the story of the three caskets, as in The Merchant of Venice; * the story of Darius and his Three Sons, versified by Thomas Occleve; * part of Geoffrey Chaucer's Man of Lawes Tale; * a version of the Crescentia cycle, similar to (though more piously phrased than) Le Bone Florence of Rome; * a tale of the emperor Theodosius, the same in its main features as that of Shakespeare's King Lear; * the first known medieval appearance of the story of The Dead King and his Three Sons * the story of the Three Black CrowsD. L. Ashliman, Of Women, Who Not Only Betray Secrets, but Lie Fearfully * the Hermit and the Angel, later known from Thomas Parnell's version; * a story identical with the Fridolin of Schiller; and * a retelling of the Man Tried by Fate, a story also known in the legends of Saint Eustace and chivalric romances such as Sir Isumbras. Manuscripts Owing to the loose structure of the book, it was easy for a transcriber to insert any additional story into his own copy, and consequently the manuscripts of the Gesta Romanorum exhibit considerable variety. Hermann Oesterley recognizes an English group of manuscripts (written always in Latin), a German group (sometimes in Latin and sometimes in German), and a group which is represented by the vulgate or common printed text. Printed editions and translations The earliest printed editions are those of Nicolaus Ketelaer and Gerardus de Leempt at Utrecht, of Arnold Hoenen at Cologne, and of Ulrich Zell at Cologne; but the exact date is in all three cases uncertain. An English translation, probably based directly on the manuscript Harl. 5369, was published by Wynkyn de Worde about 1510‚Äì15, the only copy of which now known to exist is preserved in the library of St John's College, Cambridge. In 1577 the London printer Richard Robinson published a revised edition of Wynkyn de Worde, as Certain Selected Histories for Christian Recreations, and the book proved highly popular. Between 1648 and 1703 at least eight impressions were issued. In 1703 appeared the first vol. of a translation by BP, probably Bartholomew Pratt, from the Latin edition of 1514. A translation by the Rev. Charles Swan, first published in 2 vols in 1824, forms part of Bohn's Antiquarian Library, and was re-edited by Wynnard Hooper in 1877 (see also the latter's edition in 1894). The German translation was first printed at Augsburg, 1489. A French version, under the title of Le Violier des histoires romaines moralisez, appeared in the early part of the 16th century, and went through a number of editions; it has been reprinted by Pierre-Gustave Brunet (Paris, 1858). Critical editions of the Latin text have been produced by Adelbert von Keller (Stuttgart, 1842) and Hermann Oesterley (Berlin, 1872).

Cultural references The title Gesta (\\"Deeds\\") was later gallicised as Geste. As later editions of the work tended to emphasise lighthearted or buffoonish episodes from chivalric myth, this led to the English usage of jest as a synonym of joke.

It is located at (OS grid ref. SD 233650). It is one of the Islands of Furness in northern England. It has an area of about three hectares. For local government purposes Roa Island is within the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness. The island's population stands at around 100, making it the 16th most populated island in England. __TOC__ History Until 1847 Roa Island was a true island, being accessible only by boat, or on foot across the sands at low tide. John Abel Smith, a London banker, bought Roa in 1840. He built a causeway to the mainland, completed in 1846, and an 810-foot (247 m) deep-water pier known as Piel Pier from where steamers sailed to Fleetwood. The pier connected with the Furness Railway line to Kirkby via Furness Abbey, making use of the causeway. Initially the line was open for goods traffic only, but on 24 August 1846 a passenger service was inaugurated. Over the years there was much disagreement between Smith and the Furness Railway. At one point the railway company set up its own steamer service to Piel Pier, but following a dispute with Smith, diverted the sailings to nearby Barrow. Eventually Smith was able to obtain an injunction for its return to the pier. In due course, however, Smith and the Furness Railway settled their differences and in 1852 the railway agreed to buy the lease for the entire Roa Island estate. Before the deal could be completed a freak storm caused extensive damage to the pier. This allowed the railway to buy all the rights and the property for only ¬£15,000. Piel Pier was demolished in 1891 following changes to the course of Piel Channel which resulted in silting up of the area around the end of the pier. The railway continued in use until July 1936. Today there is little obvious trace of it, though many of the stones that form the sides of the causeway are actually square stone sleepers from the railway. A road linking Roa Island to Rampside has now taken the place of the railway tracks along the causeway.The Cumbria Coastal Way, Brit Long-distance Series, A Cicerone Guide Series, Ian Brodie, Krysia Brodie, Illustrated , Cicerone Press Limited, 2007, , , pg. 57 Modern-day Roa Island Roa Island has a population of about one hundred. Despite its moderate area it boasts a yacht club, a former hotel (the Roa Island Hotel built in 1849 and originally called the Pier Hotel), and a cafe, within which enquiries can be made about the ferry to Piel Island. Overlooking the sea with a south-facing aspect is Villa Marina. This house was built for the Furness industrialist H.W. Schneider as a holiday residence. Over the years it has served as a fisheries investigation laboratory and as army premises during World War II. It is now a hotel. On the lawn are seven cannon pointing out to sea. Other interesting buildings include Trinity Terrace, a row of terraced houses built to provide accommodation for the ten Trinity House pilots; and The Watch Tower, a former Customs and Excise House built in 1847. Roa Island is home to a lifeboat station of the RNLI, serving Morecambe Bay and the Irish Sea. The station was established in 1864 and was known at the time as Piel (Barrow). In recent years it has been completely rebuilt and enlarged. Local people have been critical that the tourism potential of Roa Island has been little publicised, whilst other more negative aspects of the local area have been more widely documented, for example in Channel Four's The Secret Millionaire.

The legend dates back to 1159, when the Abbot of Whitby imposed a penance on three hunters, and on their descendants for all time, for murdering a hermit at Eskdale. The hunters were following a wild boar near Whitby. When the boar took refuge in a hermitage at Eskdale, the nobles set upon the monk living there, who had closed the door on the hounds. Before he died, the monk consented to forgive them and spare their lives if they and their descendants would enact a penance. Each year, on the eve of Ascension Day, on the east bank of the River Esk in Whitby, they had to construct a short hedge from stakes woven together, able to withstand three tides. The instructions stipulated that a knife \\"of a penny price\\" was to be used. The ceremony is still performed in Whitby every year on Ascension Eve, by the occupiers of the land formerly owned by the Abbot. A horn is sounded and followed by the cry \\"Out on ye! Out on ye! Out on ye!\\" or \\"Out on ye - for the heinous crime on ye\\". The date of the ceremony on Ascension Eve, has been taken as being 38 days from Easter Sunday. With this, it was easy to predict that the tides would be low by 9:00 am each morning as Easter Sunday is decided and regulated by the moon and the moon dictates the tides also. However, in its 858 year history, the ceremony could not be completed in 1981, due to the tide being too high. Apart from 1981, the ceremony has been carried out each year (according to available documents). The tradition is said to have dated back to a ritual known as Horngarth. This was a requirement of tenants to maintain the hedges that divided their lands, otherwise they would forfeit them to the Abbot of Whitby. The folk-tale about the death of the hermit, has led many writers and historians to believe this was just a story attached to the tradition of the upkeep of hedges and hedgerows. In literature The Penny Hedge legend is a major plot point in the children's book The Whitby Child by Robin Jarvis.

Originally published by Puffin Books in 1982, the title is the first gamebook in the Fighting Fantasy series. It was later republished by Wizard Books in 2002, and Scholastic Books in 2017. As well as launching the Fighting Fantasy series, the gamebook inspired two direct sequels and five novels, and has been adapted into a board game, an audio drama and a video game. Publication history In 1980, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone attended a Games Day, and after meeting with a Penguin editor decided to create a series of single- player gamebooks. Their first submission, The Magic Quest, was a short adventure intended to demonstrate the style of game. The Magic Quest was eventually accepted by Penguin Books, although the authors devoted a further six months to expanding and improving upon the original concept. The end result was The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, and after several rewrites, the book was accepted and published in 1982 under Penguin's children's imprint, Puffin Books. The original cover of the book was illustrated by Peter Andrew Jones, with the interior illustrations by Russ Nicholson. Jackson and Livingstone approved all artwork. The title, like the game books that followed in the Fighting Fantasy series, distinguished itself by featuring a fantasy role-playing element, with the caption on each cover reading \\"a Fighting Fantasy gamebook in which YOU become the hero!\\" Uncertain as to how popular such a new and untried concept might prove to be, Penguin ran a first printing of just 5,000 copies. These quickly sold out, leading Penguin to do additional print runs.https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/bndz94/steve-jackson-ian- livingstone-283-v16n12 The success of the Fighting Fantasy series (distribution in over 17 countries) allowed for numerous reprints of the original title, although the cover of subsequent versions changed due to deliberate redesign, printing errors, and releases in different markets. When the franchise was acquired by Wizard Books in 2002, the title (as with others in the series) was the first to be reprinted, again with a completely different cover, the rationale being that the old cover did not suit the modern market. In 2007 Wizard Books released a special 25th anniversary edition, which included supplementary material. The cover for this edition had the original picture from the 1982 edition. In 2009 Wizard Books released another edition of the original book, with yet another new cover. In 2017 Scholastic Books began publishing Fighting Fantasy books, and released a new edition of The Warlock of Firetop Mountain with new interior art as well as a new cover. Rules Plot The Warlock of Firetop Mountain is a fantasy scenario involving a dungeon quest to find \\"an untold wealth of treasure\\". The player takes the role of an adventurer travelling to find the treasure of a powerful Warlock, hidden deep within Firetop Mountain. People from a nearby village advise that the treasure is stored in a chest with two locks, and that the keys are guarded by various creatures within the dungeons. The player must then navigate the dungeons beneath Firetop Mountain, battle monsters and attempt to locate the keys. Reception Nicholas J R Dougan reviewed The Warlock of Firetop Mountain for White Dwarf #36, giving it an overall rating of 10 out of 10, and stated that \\"The book would make an ideal present for anyone who has expressed an interest in role-playing games, or indeed any young brother (or sister!). I imagine that the minimum age would be about ten, but I would recommend it to novice and veteran players alike for quite a few hours of entertainment.\\" Chris Pramas comments: \\"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain, by Games Workshop founders Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, was a pioneering release that popularized the solo gamebook and successfully brought the roleplaying game experience to a wider audience. This book alone sold over two million copies and it was only the first of the Fighting Fantasy series. The Warlock of Firetop Mountain spawned 58 more Fighting Fantasy books in the original series, a support magazine, a board game, an ambitious spinoff series, several computer games, two traditional roleplaying games, and a series of fantasy novels. Then there was the legion of imitators, another sure sign of success.

The first, Return to Firetop Mountain (the 50th title in the Fighting Fantasy series) was published in 1992 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the franchise. The second sequel, Legend of Zagor (the 54th title in the series) was written by Carl Sargent although it was credited to Livingstone. It differed from traditional gameplay in that the player could choose one of four characters. Sargent also wrote The Zagor Chronicles which were also partly credited to Livingstone. It was a series of four novels published from 1993 to 1994. The warlock Zagor also appeared in the first Fighting Fantasy novel, The Trolltooth Wars (1989), by Steve Jackson. In other media A boardgame designed by Steve Jackson was released in 1986 by Games Workshop. Based on the book, players must navigate a maze and overcome monsters in a bid to be the first to open the Warlock's treasure chest. A ZX Spectrum game based on the book was released by Crystal Computing in 1984. The gamebook was also converted into a 40-page d20 System role-playing adventure by Jamie Wallis. It was published by Myriador in 2003 and reissued in pdf format by Greywood Publishing in 2008. In 2009, Big Blue Bubble released an action-RPG for the Nintendo DS titled Fighting Fantasy: The Warlock of Firetop Mountain and based on the original title. In 2010, an electronic version of the title was released for the iPhone and iPad. When Big Blue Bubble later lost the license, all its apps were withdrawn. This gamebook has later been released by Tin Man Games. On 10 February 2011 an Amazon Kindle edition of the title was launched by UK developer Worldweaver Ltd and in September 2011 a PSP and PlayStation 3 version was announced by UK developer Laughing Jackal. On 30 October 2015 the Australian game developers Tin Man Games launched a Kickstarter project to develop a video game based on the book, which was released in 2016. The gamebook was adapted into a role-playing adventure for the Advanced Fighting Fantasy system by Brett Schofield for Arion Games in 2016. In July 2017 the British audio company FoxYason Music Productions, known for their work with Big Finish Productions, announced that they had obtained the licence to make an original audio drama based on The Warlock of Firetop Mountain. Sub-titled 'The Hero's Quest' the drama is written by David N. Smith and directed by Richard Fox and features many of the characters and locations from the original gamebook. The drama was released in September 2017 and features Toby Longworth as Zagor, Rachel Atkins as Vale Moonwing and Tim Treloar as Cassius Stormblade.http://www.fightingfantasyaudiodramas.com/ References External links *Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks ‚Äì the book at the official website * Scholastic Books - site of the new publisher * Wizard Books ‚Äì the previous publisher's site * Fighting Fantasy Audio Dramas - website of the audio drama adaptation Category:1982 fiction books Category:Fighting Fantasy gamebooks Category:Books by Steve Jackson Category:Books by Ian Livingstone ","title":"The Warlock of Firetop Mountain"},{"id":"1155849","text":"Shiba may refer to: *Shiba Inu, a breed of dog *Shiba, Tokyo, a former ward of Tokyo, Japan *Shiba Park in Tokyo *Shiba clan, Japanese clan originating in the Sengoku period *Shiba, Mingguang, in Mingguang, Anhui, PR China *Shiba, Boluo County, in Boluo County, Guangdong, PR China People with the surname * Shiba K≈çkan (1747‚Äì1818), Japanese painter and printmaker of the Edo period *, Japanese snowboarder * Ryotaro Shiba (1923‚Äì1996), Japanese author * Shigeharu Shiba (born 1932), anime audio director and producer * Shiba Takatsune (1305‚Äì1367), the Constable (shugo) of Echizen Province during the 14th century * Shiba Yoshimasa (1350‚Äì1410), Japanese general and administrator during the Muromachi period Fictional characters: * K≈´kaku Shiba, Ganju Shiba and Kaien Shiba, fictional characters in Bleach * Tatsuya Shiba and Miyuki Shiba, fictional characters in The Irregular at Magic High School * Takeru Shiba and Kaoru Shiba, fictional characters in Samurai Sentai Shinkenger * Jayden Shiba and Lauren Shiba, fictional characters in Power Rangers: Samurai Category:Japanese-language surnames ","title":"Shiba"},{"id":"1155853","text":"Mohan Lal may refer to: * Mohanlal (born 1960), Indian actor, producer and playback singer * Mohan Lal (Zutshi) (1812‚Äì1877), traveller, diplomat, and author ","title":"Mohan Lal"},{"id":"1155864","text":"William Marks may refer to: *William Marks (Pennsylvania) (1778‚Äì1858), American lawyer, U.S. Senator for Pennsylvania *William Marks (Latter Day Saints) (1792‚Äì1872), American early religious leader in the Latter Day Saint movement *Commander William J.

Biography Hoccleve was born in 1368, as he states when writing in 1421 (Dialogue, 1.246) that he has seen \\"fifty wyntir and three\\". Nothing is known of his family, but they probably came from the village of Hockliffe in Bedfordshire.J. A. Burrow: Hoccleve, Thomas...: Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: OUP, 2004; online ed., January 2008 Retrieved 24 November 2010. Subscription required. In November 1420, Hoccleve's fellow Privy Seal clerk John Bailey returned land and tenements in Hockliffe to him, suggesting that Hoccleve may indeed have had family ties there. What is known of his life comes mainly from his works and from administrative records. He obtained a clerkship in the Office of the Privy Seal at the age of about twenty.He remarks in the Regiment of Princes (c. 1411, 11.804‚Äì5) that he has been writing for the seal \\"xxti year and iiij, come Estren\\" (quoted by A. Burrow: Hoccleve, Thomas....) This would require him to know French and Latin. He retained the post on and off for about 35 years, despite grumbling. He had hoped for a church benefice, but none came. However, on 12 November 1399 he was granted an annuity by the new king, Henry IV.¬£10 per annum, raised to 20 marks (¬£13 6s. 8d.) in 1409, the last half- yearly payment being made on 11 February 1426. His fringe benefits included board and lodging, money for robes at Christmas, two corrodies, occasional bonuses, and fees and favours from clients. A Burrow: Hoccleve, Thomas.... The Letter to Cupid, the first datable poem of his was a 1402 translation of L'Epistre au Dieu d'Amours of Christine de Pisan, written as a sort of riposte to the moral of Troilus and Criseyde, to some manuscripts of which it is attached. La Male Regle (c. 1406), one of his most fluid and lively works, is a mock-penitential poem that gives some glimpses of dissipation in his youth. By 1410 he had married \\"only for love\\" (Regiment..., 1.1561) and settled down to writing moral and religious poems. He was still married in November 1420 when he and his wife receive bequests in a will. His best-known Regement of Princes or De Regimine Principum, written for Henry V of England shortly before his accession, is a homily on virtues and vices, adapted from Aegidius de Colonna's work of the same name, from a supposed epistle of Aristotle known as Secretum Secretorum, and a work of Jacques de Cessoles (fl. 1300) translated later by Caxton as The Game and Playe of Chesse. The Regement survives in at least 43 manuscript copies. It comments on Henry V's lineage, to cement the House of Lancaster's claim to England's throne. Its incipit is a poem occupying about a third of the whole, containing further reminiscences of London tavern life in a dialogue between the poet and an old man. He also remonstrated with Sir John Oldcastle, a leading Lollard, calling on him to \\"rise up, a manly knight, out of the slough of heresy.\\" The Series, which combines autobiographical poetry, poetic translations and prose moralizations of the translated texts, begins with a description of a period of \\"wylde infirmitee\\". in which the Hoccleve-character claims he temporarily lost his \\"wit\\" and \\"memorie\\" (this stands as the earliest autobiographical description of mental illness in English).(Complaint, 11.40 ff.) He describes recovering from this \\"five years ago last All Saints\\" (Complaint, 11.55‚Äì6) but still experiencing social alienation as a result of gossip about this insanity.A. Burrow: Hoccleve, Thomas. The Series continues with \\"Dialog with a Friend,\\" which claims to be written after his recovery and gives a pathetic picture of a poor poet, now 53, with sight and mind impaired. In it he tells the unnamed friend of his plans to write a tale he owes to his good patron, Humphrey of Gloucester, and of translating a portion of Henry Suso's popular Latin treatise on the art of dying ‚Äì a task the friend discourages, pointing out that too much study was the cause of his mental illness. The Series then fulfils this plan, continuing with his moralized tales of Jereslaus' Wife and of Jonathas (both from the Gesta Romanorum). The Series next turns to Learn to die, a theologically and psychologically astute verse translation of Henry Suso's Latin prose Ars Moriendi (Book II, Chapter 2 of the Horologium Sapientiae). The theme of mortality and strict calendar structure of the Series link this sequence of poems to the death of Hoccleve's friend and Privy Seal colleague John Bailey in November 1420. This motivation is supported by the revised date of the Series - November 1420 to All Saints (1 November) 1421 - bringing forward the date of his mental illness to 1415. Two autograph manuscripts of the Series survive. In addition to writing his own poetry, Hoccleve seems to have supplemented the income from his Privy Seal clerkship by working as a scribe. He was \\"Scribe E\\" on a manuscript of John Gower's Confessio Amantis, which also features \\"Scribe B\\", copyist of the Hengwrt_Chaucer and Ellesmere_Chaucer manuscripts, and the prolific copyist \\"Scribe D\\".A. I. Doyle and M. B. Parkes, \\"The Production of Copies of the Canterbury Tales and the Confessio Amantis in the Early Fifteenth Century\\", in Medieval Scribes, Manuscripts and Libraries: Essays Presented to N. R. Ker, ed. M. B. Parkes and Andrew G. Watson (London: Scolar Press, 1978), pp. 163‚Äì210. He also compiled a formulary of more than a thousand model Privy Seal documents in French and Latin for the use of other clerks.BL, Add. MS 24062. On 4 March 1426 the Exchequer issue rolls record a last reimbursement to Hoccleve (for red wax and ink for office use). He died soon after. On 8 May 1426 his corrody at Southwick Priory was granted to Alice Penfold to be held \\"in manner and form like Thomas Hoccleve now deceased\\". Work Like his more prolific, better known contemporary John Lydgate, Hoccleve is a key figure in 15th-century English literature. For much of the 20th century his work was little valued, but it is now seen as offering great insight into the literate culture of England under the Lancastrian regime. It represented for the 15th century the literature of their time, keeping alive the innovations to vernacular poetics originally made by their \\"maister\\" Geoffrey Chaucer, to whom Hoccleve pays affectionate tribute in three passages in his De Regimine Principum. Hoccleve's first work for which a certain date is known is \\"Letter of Cupid\\" (1402).Medium √Üvum, Vol. 40, No. 1, 1971 Retrieved 15 August 2017. The main interest in Hoccleve's poems today is for portraying the character of his time. His hymns to the Virgin, ballades to patrons, complaints to the king and the kings treasurer, versified homilies and moral tales, with warnings to heretics like Oldcastle, illustrate the blight that had fallen upon poetry with Chaucer's death. The nearest approach to the realistic touch of his master occurs in Hoccleve's Male Regle. Compared to Lydgate, these pictures of 15th-century London are more serious, as they ruminate on a civil servant's place in an unstable Lancastrian bureaucracy. Portrait of Chaucer from Hoccleve's Regement (or Regiment) of Princes Yet Hoccleve claimed to know the limits of his powers. His diction is relatively simple and straightforward, and as a metrist he is highly self-deprecating. While he confesses that \\"Fader Chaucer fayn wolde han me taught, But I was dul and learned lite or naught,\\" this pose was conventional in 15th-century poetry and an inheritance from Chaucer himself, whose alter-ego Geoffrey was portrayed as fat and dimwitted in both the \\"House of Fame\\" and The Canterbury Tales. Later known as the \\"humility topos\\", this posture would become a conventional form of authorial self-presentation in the Renaissance.The seminal study of this self-effacing performance typical of 15th-century writers is David Lawton's 1987 ELH article \\"Dullness and the Fifteenth Century\\". The scansion of his verses seems occasionally to call in French fashion for an accent on an unstressed syllable. Yet the seven-line rhyme royal and eight-line stanzas to which he limited himself are perhaps more reminiscent of Chaucer's rhythm than Lydgate's. The Oxford English Dictionary cites Hoccleve as one of the initial users of the term \\"slut\\" in its modern sense, though not in its modern spelling. A poem, Ad beatam Virginem, generally known as Mother of God and once attributed to Chaucer, is copied among Hoccleve's works in manuscript in Phillipps 8151 (Cheltenham), and so may be regarded as his work. Hoccleve found an admirer in the 17th century in William Browne, who included his Jonathas in Shepheard's Pipe (1614). Browne added a eulogy of the poet, whose works he intended to publish in their entirety (Works, ed. WC Hazlitt, 1869, ii. f 96-198). In 1796 George Mason printed Six Poems by Thomas Hoccleve never before printed ...; De Regimine Principum was printed for the Roxburghe Club in 1860, and by the Early English Text Society in 1897. (See Frederick James Furnivall's introduction to Hoccleve's Works; I. The Minor Poems, in the Phillipps manuscript 8131, and the Durham manuscript III. p, Early English Text Society, 1892.) Hoccleve's Handwriting Hoccleve has left behind more manuscripts and documents in his own hand than any other known medieval English writer. There are four literary manuscripts that are generally considered by scholars to have been solely or mostly in his hand. These are Durham, University Library, Cosin MS V. iii. 9 (The Series); London, British Library, MS Harley 219, recently identified by Misty Schieberle (in Hoccleve‚Äôs hand are extracts from the Gesta Romanorum, some of Odo of Cheriton‚Äôs Fables, Christine de Pizan‚Äôs Epistre Othea, and an English-French glossary); and San Marino, Huntington Library MSS HM 111 and HM 744 (collections of his shorter poems). There exist also two other literary manuscripts that may contain additions and/or corrections in Hoccleve's hand. A certain attribution is Scribe E in Cambridge, Trinity College, MS R.3.2, John Gower‚Äôs Confessio Amantis, ff. 82r‚Äì84r, first column; a possible attribution is Hand F in Aberystwyth, National Library of Wales, Peniarth MS 392 D [Hengwrt], Geoffrey Chaucer‚Äôs Canterbury Tales, ff. 83v, line 24 from fourth term; 138v, lines 25 b‚Äì26; and 150r, line 30). Hoccleve also wrote out the majority of the Privy Seal Formulary in the British Library, MS Add. 24,062. His writing stints in the Formulary and those of his Privy Seal colleagues in the Formulary and in BL, Harley MS 219 have been identified by Sebastian Sobecki. Editions Furnivall's edition of Hoccleve's complete works, still largely standard in current scholarship, was reprinted in the 1970s, though Michael Seymour's Selections from Hoccleve, published by Clarendon Press (a division of Oxford U.P.) in 1981, provides an excellent sampling of the poet's major and minor works for readers trying to get the sense of Hoccleve's work. J. A. Burrow's 1999 EETS edition of Thomas Hoccleve's Complaint and Dialogue is becoming the standard edition of these two excerpts from the Hoccleve's later works (now collectively known as The Series), as is Charles Blyth's TEAMS Middle English Text Series edition of The Regiment of Princes from the same year ‚Äì particularly for its modernised spelling, which makes it easier to use in the classroom. These three recent editions all contain introductions offering a thorough sense of a poet hitherto under-appreciated. Scholarship *Knapp, Ethan.

It is adjacent to the City of Saint John along the Kennebecasis River. Geography Located along the lower Kennebecasis River valley, Rothesay borders the city of Saint John to the southwest, and the neighbouring town of Quispamsis to the northeast. It is served by a secondary mainline of the Canadian National Railway, though there is no longer any passenger service on the line. History The town developed first as a shipbuilding centre and later as a summer home community for Saint John's wealthy elite with the arrival of the European and North American Railway in 1853. There is a commonly known story that the new town was named in honour of the visiting Prince of Wales, later King Edward VII, in 1860 because the area was said to have reminded him of Rothesay, on the Isle of Bute, in Scotland. However, an entry made in the diary of William Franklin Bunting, of Saint John, during the same visit refers to the Rothesay train station. It is unlikely that the name would have taken hold less than a day after the prince's passage through the settlement and so it likely predates the visit or was specifically bestowed on the town in the prince's honour as Duke of Rothesay. In 1870, a Saint John-owned ship named Rothesay made a famous voyage when a 20-year-old woman named Bessie Hall took command of the fever-stricken ship and sailed it from Florida to Liverpool, England. Present day Rothesay contains many historical landmarks, such as the Rothesay Common, the Rothesay Yacht Club, the former train station (one of the last remaining examples of early railway architecture in Canada), many homes that pre-date Confederation, public parks and modern amenities. The community provides numerous places of worship and recreation areas, along with the convenience of local retail and large-scale commercial developments in the nearby city of Saint John. According to a 2015 Canadian Business article, the top five richest neighbourhoods in the Province of New Brunswick all lie within the Town of Rothesay. Police services are provided by Kennebecasis Regional Police Force. Rothesay lies in the Anglophone South School District and schools include Rothesay Park School, Rothesay High School and Rothesay Netherwood School and was formerly the headquarters of New Brunswick School District 06, Both New Brunswick Route 100 and New Brunswick Route 111 run through the town and connect with New Brunswick Route 1. The town is served by Saint John Transit. Amalgamation In 1996, the proposition that Grand Bay and the other Kennebecasis Valley communities amalgamate with Saint John was publicly opposed. Concern that a new city would compete with Saint John for government funding and business came after the province began discussing an amalgamation of the Kennebecasis Valley communities in 1997. On January 1, 1998, the former incorporated villages of East Riverside-Kinghurst, Fairvale, and Renforth; the town of Rothesay; and part of the community of Wells in the local service district of the Rothesay Parish were amalgamated to form the town of Rothesay as part of a province-wide rationalization of municipal-level governments. The town motto, Quinque luncta In Uno (Five United In One), represents the joining together of the five founding communities. Occasional discussion about the possibility of further amalgamating Rothesay with Quispamsis has not proceeded beyond the discussion phase, though the two municipalities do collaborate extensively to share services and facilities.

Heath, the tenant of the mill, witnessed this attack and gave a description similar to Helliker's to a police officer, Read; furthermore, Helliker had been heard praising the attacks on the machines. He was arrested in Trowbridge on 3 August 1802. Heath later picked him out in an identification parade although Helliker was the only mill employee in the line-up and already known to him. He was taken before the magistrates and denied the offence, however the magistrate, Mr Jones told him Despite Helliker having an alibi from his friend Joseph Warren, to the effect that they had both got drunk on the night in question and had locked themselves inside a house until the morning, he was charged and lodged in Salisbury gaol. Thomas Helliker was tried in Salisbury despite the fact that many people at the time believed his statements that he was innocent, and tried to get him to name the actual culprit. He refused to do so; Warren failed to attend the court to support the alibi, having been taken to Yorkshire by colleagues who had felt that he would not withstand questioning. The only evidence against Helliker was that of Heath's identification, although he had also been given ¬£500, a very large sum at that time, as a reward. Helliker's counsel, a Mr Garrow, failed to undermine Heath's identification, and a newspaper report of the time said Helliker was hanged on his 19th birthday; his colleagues claimed his body and carried it across Salisbury Plain back to Trowbridge. On 22 March 2003, the anniversary of his hanging was marked by a ceremony by the side of his tomb, and it was then said that Final letter A handwritten copy of the last letter written by Helliker (signed Hiliker) is on display at Trowbridge Museum. In 2010 it was selected as one of 100 objects in the BBC's A History of the World project, in partnership with the British Museum and 350 museums and institutions across the country.

It works to improve the art and science of town and country planning. It campaigns for the reform of the UK's planning system to make it more responsive to people's needs and aspirations and to promote sustainable development. History Founded by Sir Ebenezer Howard in 1899 to promote the idea of the Garden City, the TCPA is Britain's oldest charity concerned with planning, housing and the environment. The association was first called the Garden City Association, and then the Garden Cities and Town Planning Association, broadening its scope to promote town planning as well as garden cities. As such, it became the first pressure group for planning and predates the formation of the Royal Town Planning Institute. Objectives The TCPA has been a reformist movement for over a hundred years ‚Äì evidenced by its interest in fair shares in development and land value uplift; shared ownership of public open space; participative and entrepreneurial local governance; town and country planned together, and enhancement of the environment ‚Äì and the need to achieve sustainable communities. The TCPA objectives in its new Manifesto for the 21st Century, are to: * Secure a decent, well designed home for everyone, in a human-scale environment combining the best features of town and country * Empower people and communities to influence decisions that affect them * Improve the planning system in accordance with the principles of sustainable development Activities As part of its educational remit, the TCPA arranges conferences and study tours. The association is not only confined to England but is also involved in a range of European projects. Projects =Garden Cities= Building on its legacy, the TCPA has been setting out a proactive agenda around garden cities, with a positive response from the government. The association believes that a new generation of 21st century garden cities could help to solve a range of problems such as the acute shortage of housing in the UK and the need to respond to climate change Recently, the Prime Minister has made a statement outlining his support of the garden principles and drafted a prospectus on locally led garden cities. Ebbsfleet has been proposed as a potential new garden city. However, although the site is well-connected it is difficult to see how it could meet all of the Garden City Principles but must genuinely offer affordable homes, according to the TCPA. =Reuniting Planning and Health= = Green Infrastructure Partnership = The Green Infrastructure Partnership (GIP) brings together a network of over 300 stakeholder organisations and individuals to support the development of green infrastructure (GI) in England. The GIP was launched by DEFRA in 2011 and was taken over by the TCPA in April 2014. =Climate Coalition= The Planning & Climate Change Coalition, which has been brought together by Friends of the Earth and the TCPA, includes over 60 cross-sector organisations and individuals. The Coalition has worked to ensure that the planning system makes a full contribution to meeting the climate change challenge. They have developed planning guidance and model policies on climate change for local authorities in England. The aim of the Coalition is to build a consensus amongst a wide range of stakeholders on the benefits of guidance on planning for climate change, working with local authorities, Local Enterprise Partnerships and communities. The Coalition has no core funding and no political or corporate affiliations. = Clim-Cap = Clim-Cap is a two-year pan-European project funded by the EU's Lifelong Learning Programme to develop training leading to a qualification in climate change adaptation for professionals working in construction, architecture, planning and other built environment professions.

Life Wesley was born at the family estate of Dangan Castle, near Summerhill, a village near Trim in County Meath, Ireland, to Richard Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington, and Elizabeth Sale. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin, and was elected its first Professor of Music in 1764. From early childhood he showed extraordinary talent on the violin, and soon began composing his own works.Longford, Elizabeth Wellington. The Years of the Sword Panther Edition, 1971, p. 32. As a composer he is remembered chiefly for glees such as \\"Here in cool grot\\" (lyrics by William Shenstone) and for a double Anglican chant. It was the future Duke of Wellington who, alone of his children, inherited something of his musical talent. Wesley represented Trim in the Irish House of Commons from 1757 until 1758, when he succeeded his father as 2nd Baron Mornington. In 1759 he was appointed Custos Rotulorum of Meath and in 1760, in recognition of his musical and philanthropic achievements, he was created Viscount Wellesley, of Dangan Castle in the County of Meath, and Earl of Mornington. He was elected Grandmaster of the Grand Lodge of Ireland in 1776, a post he held until the following year. Like his father he was careless with money, and his early death left the family exposed to financial embarrassment, leading ultimately to the decision to sell all their Irish estates.Longford p.53 Legacy Four streets in Camden Town, which formed part of the estate of his son-in-law Henry FitzRoy, were named Mornington Crescent, Place, Street and Terrace after him. Of these, the first has since become famous as the name of a London Underground station. Family Wesley married The Hon. Anne Hill-Trevor, eldest daughter of the banker Arthur Hill-Trevor, 1st Viscount Dungannon, and his wife Anne Stafford, on 6 February 1759. His godmother, the famous diarist Mary Delany, said the marriage was happy, despite his lack of financial sense and her \\"want of judgment\\".Longford p. 33. They had nine children, most of them were historically significant: * Richard, Viscount Wellesley (20 June 1760 ‚Äì 26 September 1842); later 1st Marquess Wellesley, 2nd Earl of Mornington. * Arthur Gerald Wellesley (? - 1768), named after his maternal grandfather and died at six or seven. * The Hon. William Wellesley (20 May 1763 ‚Äì 22 February 1845); later William Wellesley-Pole, 3rd Earl of Mornington, 1st Baron Maryborough. * Francis Wellesley (1767 - 10 March 1770), died at three. * Lady Anne Wellesley (13 March 1768 ‚Äì 16 December 1844), married (1) The Hon. Henry FitzRoy (younger son of Charles FitzRoy, 1st Baron Southampton), (2) Charles Culling Smith. * The Hon. Arthur Wellesley (c. 1 May 1769 ‚Äì 14 September 1852); later 1st Duke of Wellington. * The Revd and Hon.

Henry Wellesley (20 January 1773 ‚Äì 27 April 1847); later 1st Baron Cowley. Four of Lord Mornington's five sons were created peers in the Peerages of Great Britain and the United Kingdom. The Barony of Wellesley (held by the Marquess Wellesley) and the Barony of Maryborough are now extinct, whilst the Dukedom of Wellington and Barony of Cowley are extant.

It was visited by the founder of the English Oratorians (Cardinal) John Henry Newman of The Oratory of St Philip Neri in Edgbaston, Birmingham. The parish and later the church were named after Saint Philip Neri in honour of Newman since Philip Neri had founded the original Oratory church in Rome. Parish registers of the church dating as far back as 1864 can be inspected at the Liverpool Record Office. In the 1950s, the then priest Dr John Garvin, transformed an adjoining bombsite into a Spanish garden, 'El Jardin della Nuestra Senora' - the Garden of Our Lady. the church became the chaplaincy for the Universities (The University of Liverpool and Liverpool John Moores University) in September 2001 when the old Liverpool University chaplaincy relocated from its previous home on the cathedral precinct, opposite the University of Liverpool Guild of Students, on Mount Pleasant.

The game was released in North America on October 15, 2003 and in Europe on March 12, 2004. The Game Boy Advance version was also released on a Triple Pack cartridge bundled with SpongeBob SquarePants: SuperSponge and Rugrats: I Gotta Go Party in 2005. The game spawned two direct sequels, Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams and Tak: The Great Juju Challenge, as well as two spinoffs based on the Tak TV series, Tak and the Guardians of Gross and Tak: Mojo Mistake. Gameplay The gameplay mostly consists of platforming obstacles and puzzles. The player has a health-meter represented by the feather on Tak's head. Tak's abilities are jumping, attacking, and a unique feature, the ability to interact with and get past obstacles with the help of animals. * Orangutans: Bend trees, then release them. If the player is standing on a specific leaf, they will be sent flying. This is usually to cross large gaps and chasms. * Rhinos: Can be guided to smash obstacles, usually walls, while being ridden by the player. * Monkeys: If attacked in some way, they will throw a coconut at whatever is nearest to them. * Emus: Controllable when ridden with a larger jump distance than Tak. * Sheep: Can be placed on treadmills to activate primitive contraptions such as doors and simple lifts. When the player receives the Spirit Rattle, they gain access to the use of \\"Juju Powers\\" which are acquired by collecting tokens scattered around the environment. To restore Tak's health and mana the player must collect feathers, which are much more common in the environment than Juju Power tokens. The game heavily features collecting various other items. One of the game's developers said that the gameplay was based on Sly Cooper, the level design on the Jak and Daxter trilogy, and the humor of Ratchet and Clank which are all PlayStation exclusive franchises. Plot An ancient prophecy foretells that the Moon Juju, the kind protector of the Pupanunu people, would be weakened by the evil Tlaloc, an embittered Pupanunu shaman, so he could turn the Pupanunu people into sheep as revenge for not being made high shaman in favor of another shaman, Jibolba. The prophecy also mentions a great and mighty warrior trained by the high shaman who would restore the Moon Juju, defeat Tlaloc, and bring peace to the Pupanunu people. Having escaped Tlaloc's spell, Jibolba believes his apprentice Lok to be the warrior of the prophecy and prepares to send him off; however, it appears that Lok has been turned into a sheep. Jibolba sends his younger apprentice, Tak (voiced by Jason Marsden), to find magical plants and change him back, though it turns out not to be Lok, but his squire Tobar. Jibolba tells Tak to obtain the Spirit Rattle, which allows the wielder to communicate with powerful Juju spirits to assist him, while he finds Lok. Tak returns with the Rattle to find that Lok has been trampled to death by a herd of sheep. Jibolba has Tak collect 100 magic Yorbels and Lok's spirit from the spirit world, allowing him to successfully resurrect Lok. An unfortunate side-effect of the resurrection, however, is a severe case of diarrhea (or the \\"Resurrection's Revenge\\", as Jibolba refers to). Tak obtains the Moon Stones instead while Lok recovers, restoring the Moon Juju to full strength. The Moon Juju reveals that the warrior of the prophecy is not Lok, but Tak, as he has already fulfilled almost everything the prophecy predicted. Using his arsenal of Juju spells, Tak defeats Tlaloc and turns him into a sheep, finally fulfilling the prophecy. Development Tak and the Power of Juju was developed by Avalanche Software for the PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Game Boy Advance. The game was developed under the aegis of the Nickelodeon television channel, a precedent at the time because the game was not based on any of its then existing shows or films. =TV series= Tak and the Power of Juju is a CGI television series that debuted on Nickelodeon on August 31, 2007. Tak and the Power of Juju consists of two eleven-minute stories per half-hour episode. It is Nickelodeon's first CGI series (produced in house) and the company's 31st Nicktoon. The series is directed by Mark Risley and Jim Schumann. The television series tells of Tak and his friend, Jeera, including his master, Jibolba, and other characters. Tak is faced with the responsibilities of being a shaman as he daily has to save his village from villains. The series aired every Saturday and was not as popular as other Nicktoons, and cancelled its run on January 24, 2009, due to low ratings and mixed to negative feedback from critics and viewers alike. Reception The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

Encouraged by her support Bika took advantage of the internal rivalries of the Jat clans to carve out his own territory in the \\"Jangladesh\\" region of Rajasthan and by 1485 build a small fort called Rati Ghati at the site of the city which today bears his name.Jibraeil: \\"Position of Jats in Churu Region\\", The Jats - Vol. II, Ed Dr Vir Singh, Delhi, 2006, p. 223G.S.L. Devra, op. cit., 7-8, Cf. Dayaldas ri Khyat, part 2, p. 4-5 In 1488 he began the building of the city itself. In the beginning the neighbouring Bhati chiefs were suspicious of the new growing power in their vicinity. Karni Mata, who had become the kuldevi of Rao Bika, brought the rivalry between the Rathore and Bhatis to an end by inspiring Rao Shekha, the powerful Bhati chief of Pugal, to marry his daughter with Bika. Upon Rao Jodha's death in 1488 Rao Bika attempted to claim the heirlooms promised him, only for his brothers to refuse his request. In a surprise attack he stormed Mehrangarh Fort but left his brothers unharmed and departed with only the promised heirlooms (among which were a sandalwood ‚ÄôPugal‚Äô throne, a royal umbrella, a sword and a horse of \\"divine origin\\").Beny & Matheson. Page 47. Bika's grandfather Rao Ranmal through palace intrigues had been drugged with opium and tied to his bed with his own turban and murdered. Remembering this, Rao Bika had a special short lightweight bed made so his feet hung over the edge. The idea was that if the same thing happened to him, he would still be able to stand up and fight with it on his back. This bed is today on display in the Phool Mahal in Junagarh Fort in Bikaner.Crump and Toh. Page 193. Rao Bika died in 1504.

Sabre aggregates airlines, hotels, online and offline travel agents and travel buyers. Overview The system's parent company is organized into three business units: *Sabre Travel Network: global distribution system *Sabre Airline Solutions: airline technology *Sabre Hospitality Solutions: hotel technology solutions Sabre is headquartered in Southlake, Texas, and has employees in various locations around the world. History The company's history starts with SABRE (Semi-automated Business Research Environment), a computer reservation system which was developed to automate the way American Airlines booked reservations. In the 1950s, American Airlines was facing a serious challenge in its ability to quickly handle airline reservations in an era that witnessed high growth in passenger volumes in the airline industry. Before the introduction of SABRE, the airline's system for booking flights was entirely manual, having developed from the techniques originally developed at its Little Rock, Arkansas reservations center in the 1920s. In this manual system, a team of eight operators would sort through a rotating file with cards for every flight. When a seat was booked, the operators would place a mark on the side of the card, and knew visually whether it was full. This part of the process was not all that slow, at least when there were not that many planes, but the entire end-to-end task of looking for a flight, reserving a seat and then writing up the ticket could take up to three hours in some cases, and 90 minutes on average. The system also had limited room to scale. It was limited to about eight operators because that was the maximum that could fit around the file, so in order to handle more queries the only solution was to add more layers of hierarchy to filter down requests into batches. American Airlines had already attacked the problem to some degree, and was in the process of introducing their new Magnetronic Reservisor, an electromechanical computer, in 1952 to replace the card files. This computer consisted of a single magnetic drum, each memory location holding the number of seats left on a particular flight. Using this system, a large number of operators could look up information simultaneously, so the ticket agents could be told over the phone whether a seat was available. On the downside, a staff member was still needed at each end of the phone line, and actually handling the ticket still took considerable effort and filing. Something much more highly automated was needed if American Airlines was going to enter the jet age, booking many times more seats. It was during the testing phase of the Reservisor that a high-ranking IBM salesman, Blair Smith, was flying on an American Airlines flight from Los Angeles back to IBM in New York City in 1953.Different sources disagree on many of the dates. Some place the project starting in 1953, some 1957, some place the original system in Manhattan, others Briarcliff. For instance this CNN story places the start date in 1960 and the cost at $150 million (about $ million today). The Serling book uses November 5, 1959 as the date of the announcement of the joint development and 1962 as the date of the first SABRE reservation taken at the Hartford Reservations office. He found himself sitting next to American Airlines president C. R. Smith.Oral history interview with R. Blair Smith. Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis. Smith discusses how a chance meeting with C. R. Smith, president of American Airlines, eventually led to the development of the SABRE system. Noting that they shared a family name, they began talking.The official corporate history of American Airlines, Eagle, by Robert Serling, published in 1985 by St. Martin's/Marek, recounts the story of the meeting on page 347, and indicates it was between C. R. Smith and IBM president Thomas J. Watson. Just prior to this chance meeting, IBM had been working with the United States Air Force on their Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) project. SAGE used a series of large computers to coordinate the message flow from radar sites to interceptors, dramatically reducing the time needed to direct an attack on an incoming bomber. The system used teleprinter machines located all around the world to feed information into the system, which then sent orders back out to teleprinters located at the fighter bases. It was one of the first online systems. It was not lost on either man that the basic idea of the SAGE system was perfectly suited to American Airlines' booking needs. Teleprinters would be placed at American Airlines' ticketing offices to send in requests and receive responses directly, without the need for anyone on the other end of the phone. The number of available seats on the aircraft could be tracked automatically, and if a seat was available the ticket agent could be notified instantly. Booking simply took one more command, updating the availability and, if desired, could be followed by printing out a ticket. Only 30 days later IBM sent a research proposal to American Airlines, suggesting that they join forces to study the problem. A team was set up consisting of IBM engineers led by John Siegfried and a large number of American Airlines' staff led by Malcolm Perry, taken from booking, reservations and ticket sales, calling the effort the Semi-Automated Business Research Environment, or SABRE. A formal development arrangement was signed in 1957, and the first experimental system went online in 1960, based on two IBM 7090 mainframes in a new data center located in Briarcliff Manor, New York. The system was a success. Up until this point, it had cost the astonishing sum of $40 million to develop and install (about $350 million in 2000 dollars). The SABRE system by IBM in the 1960s was specified to process a very large number of transactions, such as handling 83,000 daily phone calls.Cf. Head, Robert V. 2002 The system took over all booking functions in 1964, at which point the name had changed to the more familiar SABRE. In 1972, SABRE was migrated to IBM System/360 systems in a new underground location in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Max Hopper joined American Airlines in 1972 as director of SABRE, and pioneered its use.John Desmond. Max Hopper knows Sabre's 'software guts': American pushing limits of software at 2,000+ TPS ‚Äì transactions per second. Software Magazine. February, 1989. Originally used only by American Airlines, the system was expanded to travel agents in 1976. With SABRE up and running, IBM offered its expertise to other airlines, and soon developed Deltamatic for Delta Air Lines on the IBM 7074, and PANAMAC for Pan American World Airways using an IBM 7080. In 1968, they generalized their work into the PARS (Programmed Airline Reservation System), which ran on any member of the IBM System/360 family and thus could support any sized airline. The operating system component of PARS evolved into ACP (Airlines Control Program), and later to TPF (Transaction Processing Facility). Application programs were originally written in assembly language, later in SabreTalk, a proprietary dialect of PL/I, and now in C and C++. By the 1980s, SABRE offered airline reservations through the CompuServe Information Service, and the Prodigy Internet Service GEnie under the Eaasy SABRE brand. This service was extended to America Online (AOL) in the 1990s. American and Sabre separated on March 15, 2000. Sabre had been a publicly traded corporation, Sabre Holdings, stock symbol TSG on the New York Stock Exchange until taken private in March 2007. The corporation introduced the new logo and changed from the all-caps acronym \\"SABRE\\" to the mixed-case \\"Sabre Holdings\\", when the new corporation was formed. The Travelocity website, introduced in 1996, was owned by Sabre Holdings. Travelocity was acquired by Expedia in January 2015. Sabre Holdings' three remaining business units, Sabre Travel Network, Sabre Airline Solutions and Sabre Hospitality, today serves as a global travel technology company. Other airline systems In 1982 Advertising Age reported that \\"United Air Lines operates a similar system, Apollo, while Eastern operates Mars and Delta operates Datas.\\" Braniff International's Cowboy system was considered by Electronic Data Systems for building an airline-neutral system. Controversy A 1982 study\\"November Line of Sale Analysis\\", memo to R. E. Murray from S. D. Nason, American Airlines, Dec. 3, 1981. by American Airlines found that travel agents selected the flight appearing on the first line more than half the time. Ninety-two percent of the time, the selected flight was on the first screen. This provided a huge incentive for American to manipulate its ranking formula, or even corrupt the search algorithm outright, to favor American flights. At first this was limited to juggling the relative importance of factors such as the length of the flight, how close the actual departure time was to the desired time, and whether the flight had a connection, but with each success American became bolder. In late 1981, New York Air added a flight from La Guardia to Detroit, challenging American in an important market. Before long, the new flights suddenly started appearing at the bottom of the screen.\\"Motion of the Justice Department for an Extension of Time,\\" in \\"Re Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ‚Äì Airline Computer Reservations System,\\" Docket 41686, Civil Aeronautics Board, Oct. 5, 1983 Its reservations dried up, and it was forced to cut back from eight Detroit flights a day to none. On one occasion, Sabre deliberately withheld Continental's discount fares on 49 routes where American competed.Memo from J. L. Ott to L. A. Iovinelli et al., \\"Subject: Continental Fares\\", American Airlines, Dec. 1, 1981. A Sabre staffer had been directed to work on a program that would automatically suppress any discount fares loaded into the computer system. Congress investigated these practices and in 1983 Bob Crandall, president of American, was the most vocal supporter of the systems. \\"The preferential display of our flights, and the corresponding increase in our market share, is the competitive raison d'√™tre for having created the system in the first place,\\" he told them. Unimpressed, in 1984 the United States government outlawed screen bias. Even after biases were eliminated, travel agents using the system leased and serviced by American were significantly more likely to choose American over other airlines. The same was true of United and its Apollo system. The airlines referred to this phenomenon as the \\"halo\\" effect.Sabre (as with other Global Distribution Systems, such as Amadeus, Galileo, and Worldspan) facilitates the sale of seats under airline codeshare agreements. The fairness rules were eliminated or allowed to expire in 2010. By then, none of the major distribution systems was majority owned by the airlines.The original notice of rule making is available from the U.S. Department of Transportation at , and a PDF document of the final rule is at . In 1987 Sabre's success of selling to European travel agents was inhibited by the refusal of big European carriers led by British Airways to grant the system ticketing authority for their flights even though Sabre had obtained IATA Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) clearance for the UK in 1986. American brought High Court action which alleged that after the arrival of Sabre on its doorstep British Airways immediately offered financial incentives to travel agents who continued to use Travicom and would tie any override commissions to it. Travicom was created by Videcom, British Airways and British Caledonian and launched in 1976 as the world's first multi-access reservations system based on Videcom technology which eventually became part of Galileo UK. It connected 49 subscribing international airlines (including British Airways, British Caledonian, TWA, Pan American World Airways, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Air France, Lufthansa, SAS, Air Canada, KLM, Alitalia, Cathay Pacific and JAL) to thousands of travel agents in the UK. It allowed agents and airlines to communicate via a common distribution language and network, handling 97% of UK airline business trade bookings by 1987. British Airways eventually bought out the stakes in Travicom held by Videcom and British Caledonian, to become the sole owner. Although Sabre's vice-president in London, David Schwarte, made representations to the U.S. Department of Transportation and the British Monopolies Commission, British Airways defended the use of Travicom as a truly non-discriminatory system in flight selection because an agent had access to some 50 carriers worldwide, including Sabre, for flight information.

History Fourteenth and fifteenth century sabatons typically end in a tapered point well past the actual toes of the wearer's foot, following fashionable shoe shapes of the fourteenth century. Sabatons of the first half of sixteenth century end at the tip of the toe and may be wider than the actual foot. They were the first piece of armour to be put on, and were made of riveted iron plates called lames. These plates generally covered only the top of the foot. Some sources maintain that the broad-toed variant is the true sabaton, whereas the earlier versions should be referred to as a solleret. At least in theory, French princes and dukes were allowed to have toes of Gothic sabatons long, lords (barons and higher) 2 feet long and gentry only long.Fred & Liliane Funcken, Le Costume, l'Armure et les Armes au Temps de la Chevalerie, \\"2: Le si√®cle de la Renaissance (2)\\" (in French) The sabaton was not commonly used by knights or men at arms fighting on foot. Instead, many would simply wear leather shoes or boots. Heavy or pointy metal footwear would severely hinder movement and mobility on the ground, particularly under wet or muddy conditions. Attacks against the feet are not common in dismounted combat, as a strike to an enemy's foot would typically put the attacker in a very awkward and vulnerable position. Conversely, a mounted knight's feet would be at perfect height for strikes from dismounted soldiers, and so sabatons or other foot armour would be vital when riding into battle. An earlier solution was for the mail of the chausses to completely cover the foot, but later the mail terminated at the ankle, either overlapping the outside of the sabaton or extending beneath it. (Chapter 9) The effigy of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick in the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, shows how 15th century Italian-style sabatons would have been worn. These consist of a toe cap, four articulated lames, a foot plate and ankle plate, and a hinged heel cap, joined with buckled straps. Although the spurs are missing from the effigy, remains of rivet holes and staples may represent the way that the spurs would have been directly attached to the heel cap of the sabaton, rather than being strapped on afterwards. Other uses \\"Sabaton\\" is also the name of a type of broad-toed Flemish shoe, popular in the Late Middle Ages.

Smith, the president of American Airlines, met Blair Smith, an IBM salesman, on a flight and developed the Sabre (the Semi-Automatic Business Research Environment) concept. The system was based on SAGE, the first major system to use interactive real-time computing, which IBM had developed for military use. Sabre Corporation was founded in 1960 by American Airlines. Sabre Corporation installed the first Sabre reservation system in Briarcliff Manor, New York that year. The system consisted of two IBM 7090 mainframe computers and processed 84,000 calls per day. In 1964, Sabre's nationwide network was completed and became the largest commercial real-time data-processing system in the world. Sabre Corporation handled 7500 passenger reservations per hour in 1965. The Sabre system upgraded to IBM System/360 and moved to a new center in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1972. In 1976, the Sabre system was installed into a travel agency for the first time. This allowed travel agents to have instant access to flights. By the end of the year, 130 locations installed the Sabre system. Sabre introduced BargainFinder, the industry's first automated low-fare search capability, in 1984. The following year, easySabre was launched. It gave consumers with personal computers access to the Sabre system to make airline, hotel and car rental reservations. In 1989 The New York Times reported Sabre having \\"about 38 percent of the reservations market.\\" In 1996, the company launched Travelocity, an online travel agency.

The first revolt termed as such occurred in 1519, during Sultan Selim I's reign, near Tokat under the leadership of Cel√¢l, an Alevi preacher. Cel√¢l's name was later used by Ottoman histories as a general term for rebellious groups in Anatolia, most of whom bore no particular connection to the original Cel√¢l. As it is used by historians, the \\"Celali Rebellions\\" refer primarily to the activity of bandits and warlords in Anatolia from c. 1590 to 1610, with a second wave of Celali activity, this time led by rebellious provincial governors rather than bandit chiefs, lasting from 1622 to the suppression of the revolt of Abaza Hasan Pasha in 1659. These rebellions were the largest and longest lasting in the history of the Ottoman Empire. The major uprisings involved the sekbans (irregular troops of musketeers) and sipahis (cavalrymen maintained by land grants). The rebellions were not attempts to overthrow the Ottoman government but were reactions to a social and economic crisis stemming from a number of factors: demographic pressure following a period of unprecedented population growth during the 16th century, climatic hardship associated with the Little Ice Age, a depreciation of the currency, and the mobilization of thousands of sekban musketeers for the Ottoman army during its wars with the Habsburgs and Safavids, who turned to banditry when demobilized. Celali leaders often sought no more than to be appointed to provincial governorships within the empire, while others fought for specific political causes, such as Abaza Mehmed Pasha's effort to topple the Janissary government established after the regicide of Osman II in 1622, or Abaza Hasan Pasha's desire to overthrow the grand vizier K√∂pr√ºl√º Mehmed Pasha. Major revolts =Karayazƒ±cƒ± (1598)= The Ottoman Empire in 1590, at the outset of the Celali rebellions. Especially after the 1550s, with the increase of oppression by local governors and levying of new and high taxes, minor incidents started to occur with increasing frequency. After the beginning of the wars with Persia, especially after 1584, Janissaries began seizing the lands of the peasants to extort money, and also lent money with high interest rates, thus causing the tax revenues of the state to drop seriously. In 1598 a sekban leader, Karayazƒ±cƒ± Abd√ºlhalim, united the dissatisfied groups in the Anatolia Eyalet and established a base of power in Sivas and Dulkadir, where he was able to force towns to pay tribute to him. He was offered the governorship of √áorum, but refused the post and when Ottoman forces were sent against them, he retreated with his forces to Urfa, seeking refuge in a fortified castle, which became the center of resistance for 18 months. Out of fear that his forces would mutiny against him, he left the castle, was defeated by government forces, and died some time later in 1602 from natural causes. His brother Deli Hasan then seized Kutahya, in western Anatolia, but later he and his followers were won over by grants of governorships. =Later= The Celali unrests, however, continued under the leadership of Janbuladoglu in Aleppo and Yusuf Pasha and Kalenderoƒülu in western Anatolia. They were finally suppressed by the grand vizier Kuyucu Murad Pasha, who by 1610 had eliminated a large number of Jelalis. References Further reading * Barkey, Karen.

Early life and military career Mason was born at Chopawamsic in Stafford County, Virginia and attended College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. He studied law, was admitted to the bar, and commenced practice in Dumfries, Virginia in Prince William County, Virginia. He served in the Continental Army as an aide to General George Washington at the Battle of Yorktown and was a brigadier general in the Virginia Militia. Political career He was a member of the Virginia State House of Delegates in 1783 and 1794, a member of the Virginia State Senate 1787‚Äì1790, and a delegate to the Virginia Ratification Convention in 1788. In 1794, Mason was elected to the United States Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of James Monroe. He was reelected in 1797 and again in 1803, serving from 18 November 1794, until his death in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While in the Senate he handed a copy of the secret Jay Treaty to Pierre Ad√©t, French minister to the United States. Since his country was at war with Great Britain and hated the idea of a treaty of ‚Äúamity‚Äù between her and the United States, Ad√©t gave the document to Benjamin Bache, publisher of The Aurora ‚Äî a newspaper ‚Äî with the hope of raising just the sort of public outcry that ensued‚Äîand even, perhaps, of blocking ratification of the treaty.

Coming to political prominence at an early age, Mason was appointed his territory's acting territorial secretary by Andrew Jackson at 19, becoming the acting territorial governor soon thereafter in 1834 at 22. As territorial governor, Mason was instrumental in guiding Michigan to statehood, which was secured in 1837. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected as Michigan's first state governor in 1835, where he served until 1840. Elected at 23 and taking office at 24, Mason was and remains the youngest state governor in American history. Early life in Virginia and Kentucky Mason was born near Leesburg in Loudoun County, Virginia, into a politically powerful family. His great-grandfather, Thomson Mason (1733‚Äì1785), was chief justice of the Virginia Supreme Court and younger brother of George Mason (1725‚Äì1792), who took part in the Constitutional Convention. His grandfather, Stevens Thomson Mason (1760-1803), was a U.S. Senator from Virginia from 1794 until his death. His uncle, Armistead Thomson Mason (1787‚Äì1819), was also a U.S. Senator from Virginia. In addition, his uncles by marriage, Benjamin Howard (1760‚Äì1814) and William Taylor Barry (1784‚Äì1835), both served in the Kentucky House of Representatives and were U.S. Representatives from Kentucky. Howard was also Governor of the Louisiana (Missouri) Territory (1810‚Äì1812) and the Missouri Territory (1812‚Äì1813). Barry served as a U.S. Senator from Kentucky (1814‚Äì1816), then had a long career in a number of Kentucky government positions, and ultimately became U.S. Postmaster General (1829‚Äì1835). In 1812, Mason's father, John Thomson Mason (1787‚Äì1850), left the Mason family stronghold in Virginia to attempt to make his own fortune in Lexington, Kentucky. In 1817, President James Monroe appointed the elder Mason United States marshal. While his business ventures were a complete failure and the family became nearly broke in the 1820s, he was a lawyer and land agent from an influential family, and went on to become an important figure in the Texas Revolution. Life and politics in Michigan Territory John Mason was appointed secretary of the Michigan Territory and superintendent of Indian affairs in 1830 by President Andrew Jackson. Young Stevens was more politically savvy than his father and helped to protect him from schemes launched by anti-Jackson forces. This gained him notice from the territorial governor, Lewis Cass. In 1831, President Jackson sent the elder Mason on a mission to Mexico and named Stevens to replace his father as secretary, at the age of 19 before he could even vote. At about the same time, Governor Cass became Jackson's Secretary of War. As the territorial secretary traditionally served as acting governor, young Mason held that role until George Bryan Porter, who was named to replace Cass in August 1831, arrived in Detroit in 1832. As it turned out, Porter was frequently absent and Mason was, for all practical purposes, the acting governor during this time, leading to his nickname of the \\"Boy Governor\\". Porter died of cholera in Detroit in 1834, and so Mason was once again acting governor of the Michigan Territory. Mason was influential in petitioning for Michigan statehood. When the first petition in 1832 was not acted upon by the U.S. Congress, Mason commissioned a territorial census. When the census was completed in 1834, it determined that 86,000 people lived in the lower peninsula, more than the 60,000 required for statehood by the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. A dispute over a strip of land, the Toledo Strip, claimed by both Michigan and Ohio led to the Toledo War. President Jackson appointed Benjamin Chew Howard of Baltimore and Richard Rush of Philadelphia to arbitrate the dispute, but Mason was not satisfied with the proposal and refused to back down. Not wanting to alienate his political support in Ohio, President Jackson removed Mason as territorial secretary in August 1835 and appointed John S. (\\"Little Jack\\") Horner as his replacement. First governor of the state of Michigan Mason stood for election in 1835 to be the first governor of the state of Michigan Although replaced by Horner, Mason was still popular in Michigan. Voters approved a constitution on October 5, 1835, and they elected Mason as governor. However, the U.S. Congress refused to recognize Michigan as a state until the dispute with Ohio was resolved. In 1836, facing financial difficulties because Michigan was not recognized as a state, Mason agreed to a compromise reached by the U.S. Congress and agreed to cede the disputed land to Ohio in exchange for the western two-thirds of the Upper Peninsula; Michigan already included the eastern third. A convention in September 1836 refused to go along with Mason, but Mason finally prevailed in a second convention in December 1836. On January 26, 1837, Michigan was admitted to the Union. In 1835, Mason had initiated an ambitious internal improvements program, which included development of three railroads and two canals (one of which was the Clinton- Kalamazoo Canal). Mason was re-elected in 1837, but the state's economy soon began to suffer from the effects of the Panic of 1837. Earlier in 1837, Mason had negotiated to fund the internal improvements program through the sale of $5,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in bonds. This arrangement fell apart in 1837 and following bankruptcies by both the company building the canal and the bank backing the loans, the state was left with over $2,000,000 (equivalent to $ in ) in bad debt. During his business trips to New York to finance his internal improvements program, Mason became acquainted with Julia Phelps and the two married on November 1, 1838. In early 1838, Mason led the state militia in helping to thwart the Patriot War, an attempt by irregulars to invade and annex parts of Canada. The schooner Ann was seized by the Patriots on January 8 and sailed down to Gibraltar, Michigan. Mason, along with a detachment of 200 militiamen, pursued them in two steamships. A hundred Canadian militia also followed in the steamer Alliance. Mason met with the Patriot leaders at Gibraltar, but the captured steamship Ann continued on toward Fort Malden on the Canadian shore. On January 9, the Patriots began shelling Fort Malden and the town of Amherstburg from the Ann. The Canadian militia took up positions in the town while the Patriots moved 300 men onto the Canadian Bois Blanc Island opposite the town. The Canadian militia opened fire on the schooner when it tried to reach the island. The Canadians shot several of the ship's crew and damaged the sails and rigging. The ship drifted until it ran aground, at which point the Canadian militia boarded it, encountered no resistance, and captured the crew. The remaining Patriot forces quit Bois Blanc for the safety of the American side of the river. Several of the Patriots were wounded, a few killed, and the Canadians captured 300 muskets, 2 cannon, 10 kegs of gunpowder and various accoutrements.Col. Radcliff's report to Lt. Gov. Sir George Arthur, quoted in . The actions of the so-called \\"Patriots\\" were charged in the U.S. as a violation of the Neutrality Act. Rather than risking a contentious campaign and the possibility of an embarrassing defeat in the elections of 1839, Mason instead decided to give up politics and attempt a private law practice. His successor as governor, an old political rival, William Woodbridge, was determined to place the blame for Michigan's financial mess on Mason, and charged Mason with corruption related to the $5,000,000 loan. Mason attempted to defend himself, but his reputation was ruined. Retirement and death in New York Renovated Stevens T. Mason Monument in 2011 In 1841, Mason left Michigan for New York City, where his wealthy father- in-law, Thaddeus Phelps, lived. Mason tried to establish a law practice there, but struggled to build a clientele. He caught pneumonia in the winter of 1842 and died at the age of 31 during the night of January 4, 1843, though his date of death is sometimes listed as January 5. Mason was initially interred at New York Marble Cemetery, but on June 4, 1905, his remains were brought from New York to Detroit, accompanied by his sister Emily Mason, then age 92; his daughter, Dorothy Mason Wright; three grandsons; and several grand-nephews and great-grandchildren. Services were conducted by Rev. David M. Cooper, who had known Mason as governor, 70 years earlier. Other notable attendees included then-Governor Fred M. Warner, and the mayor of Detroit, George P. Codd. His remains were interred at Capitol Park, the site of the old Michigan Capitol.. Later, a bronze statue of Mason on a granite pedestal was erected over the grave. The statue was created by sculptor Albert Weinert and depicted the young Mason in a confident pose. On September 3, 2009, officials announced that the park would be reconfigured and the monument moved several yards. But when the crews began to excavate the site, they discovered no grave. After four days of searching, the vault containing the remains was located on June 29, 2010, a few yards south of its original site. It was believed the grave was moved from its 1905 location in 1955 to make room for a bus terminal. On the 199th anniversary of his birth, October 27, 2010, Mason was reburied for the fourth time in a newly built vault in the pedestal beneath the bronze statue designed by Albert Weinert. Mason's great-great-great grandnephew, who resides in Grosse Ile, Michigan, witnessed the reinterment. The current Dean of the Cathedral Church of St. Paul, where funeral services were held for Mason in 1843, officiated at the ceremony. Prior to the reinterment, Mason's remains were transported to Lansing where they lay in state in the Capitol Building. Mason was only the third Michigan governor to lie in state in the Capitol. Among his other accomplishments, Mason created an educational system and relocated the University of Michigan to Ann Arbor. Marriage and children Mason married Julia Elizabeth Phelps in New York City on November 1, 1838. The couple had three children: *Stevens Thomson Mason Jr. (August 1, 1839 ‚Äì January 27, 1843) *Dorothea Eliza Mason Wright (October 29, 1840 ‚Äì October 4, 1916) Known as Dora, she was the daughter-in-law of Senator William Wright and wife of Colonel Edward H.

It is the administrative headquarters of the eponymous district and is governed by the Dehradun Municipal Corporation. Part of the Garhwal region, it lies along National Highway 7 with the distance of north of India's capital New Delhi and is served by Dehradun railway station and Jolly Grant Airport. Dehradun is one of the \\"Counter Magnets\\" of the National Capital Region (NCR) being developed as an alternative centre of growth to help ease the migration and population explosion in the Delhi metropolitan area and to establish a smart city at Dehradun. Dehradun is located in the Doon Valley on the foothills of the Himalayas nestled between the river Ganges on the east and the river Yamuna on the west. The city is noted for its picturesque landscape and slightly milder climate and provides a gateway to the surrounding region. It is well connected and in proximity to Himalayan tourist destinations such as Mussoorie, Dhanaulti, Chakrata, New_Tehri, Uttarkashi, Harsil, Chopta - Tungnath, Auli, India, famous summer and winter trekking destinations like Dodital, Dayara Bugyal, Kedarkantha, Har Ki Dun for camping and grandeur Himalayan panoromic views. The Hindu holy cities of Haridwar and Rishikesh along with the Himalayan pilgrimage circuit of Chota Char Dham i.e. Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath. Dehradun is also known for its Basmati rice and bakery products. Dehradun is a notable academic and research hub and is home to Indian Military Academy, Rashtriya Indian Military College, Uttarakhand Ayurveda University, Forest Research Institute, Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, and Indira Gandhi National Forest Academy. According to the combined survey based on health, infrastructure, economy, education and safety; conducted by Dainik Jagran and KPMG, Dehradun is one of the safest cities to live in. The city stands at an elevation of approximately above sea level. Also known as the ‚ÄòAbode of Drona‚Äô, Dehradun has been an important centre for Garhwal rulers which was captured by the British. Often referred as the gateway to Mussorie. Uttarakhand Police is the main law enforcement agency in the city. Etymology During the days of British Raj, the official name of the town was Dehra. Dehradun is made up of two words ‚ÄúDehra\\" + \\"Dun.‚Äù Dehra is derived from the word ‚Äúdera‚Äù, meaning camp, and Dun or Doon in Garhwali language refers to a valley that lies between the middle Himalayas and the \\"Shivaliks\\". The town was established when Baba Ram Rai, the son of the seventh Sikh Guru, Guru Har Rai settled his \\"Dera\\" or camp in the area in 1675. Around this time, the modern city of Dehradun started to develop. This is when the word Dehra was linked to Dun, and thus the city was named Dehradun. Other prominent Doon valleys are Kotli Doon, Patli Doon and Pinjore Doon. In Skanda Purana, Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of Shiva. According to Hindu mythology, in ancient India during the Mahabharata epic era, Dronacharya the great teacher of Kauravas and Pandavas, lived here hence the name, \\"Dronanagari\\" (lit. city of Drona).History of DehradunNatural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed. By) Page 226 Mittal Publications, India Language English (31 March 2005) The city is also regarded as Devbhoomi (\\"Land of the Gods\\"). Some historians believe that the word Dehra can be regarded as a term for camping.The History of Sikh Gurus page 112 Chapter 8  History  Doon Valley, Dehradun, 1850s The history of the city of Uttarakhand, Dehradun (nicknamed \\"Doon Valley\\") is linked to the story of Ramayana and Mahabharata. It is believed that after the battle between Ravana and Lord Rama, Lord Rama and his brother Lakshmana visited this site. Also, known as 'Dronanagari' on the name of Dronacharya, legendary Royal guru to the Kauravas and Pandavas in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun. Evidences such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had an influence on this region as the rulers of Hastinapura with the descendants of Subahu ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, Rishikesh is mentioned in the pages of history when Lord Vishnu answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called Chakrata has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata. In the seventh century, this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller Huen Tsang. Sudhanagara later came to be recognized as Kalsi. Edicts of Ashoka have been found in the region along the banks of the river Yamuna in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gooroodwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as \\"Dehra or Gooroodwara\\". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city. Guru Ram Rai Darbar Sahib in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707. Dehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that Baba Ram Rai, the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his \\"Dera\\" (camp) in \\"dun\\" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun. The Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, Fateh Shah to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially, a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building, Guru Ram Rai Darbar Sahib, was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of Kangra-Guler art and Mughal art. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring 230 x 80 feet had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived. Kingdom of Garhwal. Dehradun was part of the princely state of Garhwal before becoming part of British India after the Anglo-Nepalese War in 1816. Dehradun was invaded by Mahmud of Ghazni during his campaigns into India followed by Timur in 1368, Rohilla chief Najib ad-Dawlah in 1757 and Ghulam Qadir in 1785. In 1806, the Nepalese King Prithvi Narayan Shah united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as Almora, Pathankot, Kumaon, Garhwal, Sirmur, Shimla, Kangra and Dehradun. On the western front Garhwal and parts of Himachal Pradesh up to Punjab and on the eastern front the state of Sikkim up to Darjeeling became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British East India Company went on the war from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Sugowli where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised Landour and Mussoorie in 1827‚Äì1828. Capt John War memorial maintained by the army at Dehradun Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, was quite fond of the city and often visited. He spent his last few days here before passing away in Delhi in 1964. Another leader from the independence movement, Rash Behari Bose, who was one of the key organisers of the Ghadar conspiracy and, later, the Indian National Army was based in Dehradun in his early days before he was forced to move to Japan in 1915 to continue the freedom struggle. Post-independence Dehradun and other parts of Garhwal and Kumaon were merged with United Provinces which was later renamed the state of Uttar Pradesh. In 2000, Uttarakhand state (earlier called Uttaranchal) was created from the northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh under the Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2000. Dehradun was made its interim capital. =Afghan connection= Dehradun's Afghan connection dated back to the First Anglo-Afghan War, after which the Afghan Emir Dost Mohammad Khan (Emir of Afghanistan) was exiled by the British to Dehra Dun. He stayed in Mussoorie for over 6 years. The Balahissar ward under the Mussoorie municipality has been named after the palace of Dost Mohammad. The famous Dehradooni Basmati was brought along by him from Kunar Province in Afghanistan and it continues to be counted as a delicacy of the valley. Forty years later, after the Second Anglo-Afghan War, his grandson, Mohammad Yaqub Khan, was sent to exile to India in 1879. Just like his grandfather, he chose Doon valley as his abode. Yakoob became the first Afghan to formally settle in Dehradun. The present Mangla Devi Inter College was once the Kabul Palace where Yakoob spent a few years of his life. The extended family and servants of the King were also relocated to Dehradun. The Afghan royal family maintained a presence in Dehra Dun. It was the birthplace of the second to last King of Afghanistan, Mohammed Nadir Shah. Two quaint palaces ‚Äì the Kabul Palace in Dehradun and Balahissar Palace in Mussoorie ‚Äì stand testimony to this connection with Afghanistan. They were built by these Afghan rulers in exile in India in the early part of the 20th Century and are palaces are a miniature replica of the palatial structures owned by the kings in Afghanistan. The Balahissar Palace has now been turned into Mussoorie's Wynberg Allen School. Doon-based heritage enthusiast Ghanshyam told the Times of India, \\"The police station at Karanpur used to be the royal guard room of Yakoob way back in 1879. The electrical office located at the Survey Chowk was the royal servant quarters.\\" Today the descendants of the former royalty, Yakub Khan and his grandson Sardar Azim Khan's family have integrated with the mainstream of Dehra Dun life. The Doon connection was revived when Zahir Shah, the last king of Afghanistan while undergoing treatment in New Delhi during the last years of his life expressed a desire to meet his Doon cousins but the meeting could not take place as the family members were away.Ashraf Ghani, the current President of Afghanistan has mentioned that his grandmother grew up in Dehra Dun. \\"I speak of Tagore because I was raised on Tagore by my grandmother who lived in Dehradun...,\\" Dr Ghani said while talking about India's vision and the remarkable transformation. Dehra Dun is also being selected to be the second \\"home\\" ground of the Afghan cricket team. and Afghan cricket fans recall this \\"centuries old link\\" with the town.  Geography  The city of Dehradun mainly lies in Doon Valley and is at a varying height from 410 m in Clement Town to above 700 m at Malsi which is 15 km from the city. However, the average elevation is 600 m above sea level. Malsi is the starting point of Lesser Himalayan Range that extends to Mussoorie and beyond. Jaunsar-Bawar hills in Dehradun district rises to 3700m above sea level. The hilly region of Mussoorie goes up to a height of 1870‚Äì2017 metres above sea level. Its geomorphological and meteorological characteristics make it prone to a number of natural hazards. Beside earthquake, the region is frequently devastated by landslides, cloudbursts, flash-floods, cold waves and hailstorms. The Doon valley contains the settlements including Raiwala, Rishikesh, Doiwala, Harrawala, Dehradun, Herbertpur, Vikasnagar, Sahaspur, Selaqui, Subhash Nagar and Clement Town. The district contains Rajaji National Park which is home to several elephants, Benog Wildlife Sanctuary at Mussoorie & Asan Conservation Reserve (Asan Barrage). The Doon Valley has the Terai and Bhabar forests within it as well as the Shivalik hills and Lesser Himalayan Range containing hill stations such as Mussoorie and Chakrata. The district is bordered by the Himalayas in the north, Rajaji Range of the Sivalik Hills to the south, the river Ganges to the east, and the Yamuna river to the west. Towns in the foothills of the mountain ranges include Sahastradhara, Lakhamandal, Gautam Kund, Chandrabani, Kalsi and Dakpathar. This district is divided into two major parts: the main city Dehradun surrounded by Shivalik and the Jaunsar- Bawar, which is in the foothills of Himalayas. In the north and northwest it borders on the district of Uttarkashi and Tehri Garhwal, in the east and southeast by Pauri Garhwal and Ganges river, in the west, it is bordered by Shimla and Sirmaur districts of Himachal Pradesh, Yamunanagar district of Haryana and the Tons and Yamuna rivers. To the south are Haridwar and Uttar Pradesh's Saharanpur district. It is between latitudes 30¬∞01' N and 31¬∞2'N and longitudes 77¬∞34' E and 78¬∞18'E. This district consists of six tehsils ‚Äì Dehradun, Chakrata, Vikasnagar, Kalsi, Tiuni and Rishikesh ‚Äì six community development blocks ‚Äì Vis, Chakrata, Kalsi, Vikasnagar, Sahaspur, Rajpur and Doiwala ‚Äì 17 towns and 764 villages. Out of these 746 villages are inhabited; 18 are uninhabited. =Heritage canal network= There was once an extensive canal network in the city, which irrigated many surrounding villages and produced a cooler microclimate in the region. The earliest canal, Rajpur canal, was laid in the 17th century. After Dehradun became the state capital in 2000, most of the heritage canals were covered or demolished to widen the city roads. Environmental groups have campaigned for the revival of the network, citing its benefit for the city's ecology, aesthetics, microclimate and built environment. = Climate = A cloudy view of Rajpur Town, Dehradun The climate of Dehradun is humid subtropical. It varies greatly from tropical to severe cold depending upon the altitude of the area. The city is hilly, temperature variations due to difference in elevation are considerable. In the hilly regions, the summer is pleasant. But in the Doon, the heat is often intense and summer temperatures can reach up to 44 ¬∞C for a few days and a hot wind called Loo blows over North India. Winter temperature drops below freezing point and is usually between 1 and 20 ¬∞C and fog is quite common like plains. Although the temperature in Dehradun can reach below freezing during severe cold snaps, this is not common. The area receives an average annual rainfall of 2073.3 mm. Most of the annual rainfall in the city is received during the months from June to September, July and August being rainiest. During the monsoon season, there is often heavy and protracted rainfall. Dehradun and other plains areas of Uttarakhand see almost as much rainfall as coastal Maharashtra and more than Assam.

It is about 8 miles north-west of Honiton and south of the Somerset town of Wellington. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,519. Hemyock is part of the electoral ward of Upper Culm. The population of this ward at the above census was 4,039. The River Culm flows through Hemyock. Hemyock was the former home of the St Ivel dairy processing plant, formerly where the butter-spreads 'St Ivel Gold' and 'Utterly-Butterly' were produced before being moved to a factory in the north of England. Hemyock was also the birthplace of the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs. The first Young Culm Farmers Club in England began here in 1921, and it continues to prosper as the Culm Valley Young Farmers Club. Hemyock is the largest village on the Blackdown Hills, which is now designated as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The parish has an area of about 2350 hectares, and lies on the NW of the Blackdown Hills. Its northern boundary forms part of the Devon ‚Äì Somerset border, and clockwise from there, it is surrounded by the Devon parishes of Clayhidon, Dunkeswell, Uffculme and Culmstock. Population Hemyock is a typical upland settlement consisting of a central \\"town\\" surrounded by a number of hamlets (Culm Davey, Millhayes, Simonsburrow, Ashculme, Tedburrow, Madford, Mountshayne etc.). From the 16th century to the early 19th century much of the parish's wealth came from the production of wool. The population remained fairly constant throughout the 19th century, and until the end of the Second World War. Since then a number of housing estates have been built, and the population has increased to 1,519. History The village has a very long history and some prehistoric remains may be found, from about 100 BC to well beyond. In the Middle Ages local iron ores were smelted in small bloomeries (furnaces) to produce pure iron. In Saxon times a battle was fought at Simonsburrow between the native Britons and King Ime's[Ine?] Saxon army, which put an end (temporarily) to the King's expansion to the west. The name Hemyock could have originated from the British stream name \\"Samiaco\\" (meaning summer), other authorities suggest a Saxon origin from a personal name \\"Hemman\\" coupled with a Saxon word for a bend or a hook (occi). =Hemyock Hundred= Hemyock was head of the Hemyock Hundred, an administrative sub-division of the Shire county of Devonshire, under the system of government used during the Saxon period. The Domesday Book records that the Hemyock Hundred consisted of the manors of: Awliscombe, Bolham Water, Bywood, Churchstanton (Somerset), Clayhidon, Culm Davy, Culm Pyne, Culmstock, Dunkeswell, Gorewell, Hemyock, Hole, Ivedon, Mackham, Weston. =Hemyock Castle= Remains of Hemyock Castle On 5 November 1380, King Richard II granted Sir William and Lady Margaret Asthorpe a licence to crenellate the Hemyock manor house; meaning the permission to fortify it. Hemyock Castle has many similarities with the much better known Bodiam Castle, granted the licence to crenellate in 1385. Over the centuries, Hemyock Castle had many notable owners including Lord Chief Justice Sir John Popham and General Sir John Graves Simcoe the first lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada in 1792. He is buried at Wolford Chapel near Dunkeswell. The chapel is now owned by the Province of Ontario. During the English Civil War it was held for Parliament, subjected to a brief but brutal siege and eventually slighted to destroy its military value. Parts of the castle walls, towers and moat still remain. They are a scheduled ancient monument. The castle site is privately owned: Visits can be arranged for groups; there are also public open days. St Mary's parish church, with the parish war memorial in the foreground Churches St Mary's parish church is next to Hemyock Castle, on the other side of St Margaret's Brook.

Hellbillies is a Norwegian rock band. Biography As of 2012, they have released thirteen albums‚Äîincluding a compilation and two live albums‚Äîas well as two live concert DVDs. They are among Norway's most popular recording artists. Their lyrics are written and sung in the dialect of the Hallingdal area of Norway and there is evidence of influence from traditional (folk) Norwegian music, giving a distinctive \\"Norwegian\\" flavor to their country music. Their early albums often included songs originally recorded by country music artists from the USA with Hellbillies writing new lyrics in Norwegian. Later efforts have included much more original material that reflect contemporary Norwegian people and Norwegian life and issues. They have also gradually changed their musical style from country to rock. They have collaborated with musicians from the US. For example, Rob Hajacos from Nashville, who plays fiddle on most Garth Brooks albums, plays on three of Hellbillies‚Äô albums. In 2013 Hellbillies appeared at the Kongsberg Jazz Festival performing together with Jazz guests the Violin virtuoso Ola Kvernberg and the super trumpeter Mathias Eick. In 2013 they also contributed to the book \\"Think like a rockstar\\" Tenk som en rockestjerne, written by St√•le √òkland.  Band members  Hellbillies during a concert in Langesund, July 2011.

The term is derived from the Greek words meaning \\"breaking (or pulverizing) stones\\" (litho- + œÑœÅŒØœàœâ [tripso]).  Uses  Lithotripsy is a procedure involving the physical destruction of hardened masses like kidney stones, bezoars or gallstones.  Contraindications  Techniques *Extracorporeal shock wave therapy * Intracorporeal (endoscopic lithotripsy): **Laser lithotripsy : effective for larger stones (> 2 cm) with good stone-free and complication rates. ** Electrohydraulic lithotripsy ** Mechanical lithotripsy ** Ultrasonic lithotripsy : safer for small stones (<10 mm) History Surgery was the only method to remove stones too large to pass until French surgeon and urologist Jean Civiale in 1832, invented a surgical instrument (the lithotrite) to crush stones inside the bladder without having to open the abdomen. To remove a calculus, Civiale inserted his instrument through the urethra and bored holes in the stone. Afterwards, he crushed it with the same instrument and aspirated the resulting fragments or let them flow normally with urine. Lithotripsy replaced lithotrites as the most common treatment beginning in the mid-1980s. In ESWL, external shockwaves are focused at the stone to pulverize it. Ureteroscopic methods use a rigid or flexible scope to reach the stone and direct mechanical or light energy is applied. Endoscopy can use lasers, as well as various modes of energy delivery: ultrasound, electrohydraulic, and lasers. ESWL was first used on kidney stones in 1980, and is also applied to gallstones and pancreatic stones. External shockwaves are focused and pulverize the stone which is located by imaging. The first shockwave lithotriptor approved for human use was the Dornier HM3 (human model 3) derived from a device used for testing aerospace parts. Second generation devices used piezoelectric or electromagnetic generators. American Urological Association guidelines consider ESWL a potential primary treatment for stones between 4 mm and 2 cm. Electrohydraulic lithotripsy is an industrial technique for fragmenting rocks by using electrodes to create shockwaves that was applied to bile duct stones in 1975. It can damage tissue and is mostly used in biliary tract specialty centers. Pneumatic mechanical devices have been used with endoscopes, commonly for large and hard stones. Laser lithotripsy was introduced in the 1980s. Pulsed dye lasers emit 504 nm (cyan colored) light that is delivered to the stone by optical fibers through a scope. Holmium:YAG lasers were developed more recently and produce smaller fragments.

Usage  Two capsules of smelling salts from a first-aid kit. A thin inner glass tube contains alcohol and ammonia; the outer layer is cotton and netting. When crushed, the liquid is released into the cotton, while the glass shards are retained inside. The ammonia-soaked cotton is waved in front of the nose for the treatment of fainting. The usual active compound is ammonium carbonate‚Äîa colorless-to-white, crystalline solid ((NH4)2CO3). Because most modern solutions are mixed with water, they should properly be called \\"aromatic spirits of ammonia\\". Modern solutions may also contain other products to perfume or act in conjunction with the ammonia, such as lavender oil or eucalyptus oil. Historically, smelling salts have been used on people feeling faint, or who have fainted. They are usually administered by others, but may be self-administered; some at-risk groups, such as pregnant women, may be advised to keep them close at hand. Smelling salts are often used on athletes (particularly boxers) who have been dazed or knocked unconscious to restore consciousness and mental alertness. Smelling salts are now banned in most boxing competitions, but are not harmful. They are also used as a form of stimulant in athletic competitions (such as powerlifting, strong man and ice hockey) to \\"wake up\\" competitors to perform better. In 2005, Michael Strahan estimated that 70‚Äì80% of National Football League players were using smelling salts as stimulants.  History  Flask with smelling salts, used for reviving dental patients after a procedure. French, 18th century. Smelling salts have been used since Roman times and are mentioned in the writings of Pliny as Hammoniacus sal. Evidence exists of use in the 13th century by alchemists as sal ammoniac. In the 14th century's The Canterbury Tales, a character purports to use sal armonyak. In the 17th century, the distillation of an ammonia solution from shavings of harts' (deer) horns and hooves led to the alternative name for smelling salts as spirit or salt of hartshorn. They were widely used in Victorian Britain to revive fainting women, and in some areas constables would carry a container of them for the purpose. During this time, smelling salts were commonly dissolved with perfume in vinegar or alcohol and soaked onto a sponge, which was then carried on the person in a decorative container called a vinaigrette. The use of smelling salts was widely recommended during the Second World War, with all workplaces advised by the British Red Cross and St. John Ambulance to keep smelling salts in their first aid boxes.  Physiological action  In Rembrandt's Unconscious Patient (Allegory of Smell), a woman using smelling salts to revive a man who has fainted at the hands of a barber-surgeon Smelling salts release ammonia (NH3) gas, which triggers an inhalation reflex (that is, causes the muscles that control breathing to work faster) by irritating the mucous membranes of the nose and lungs. Fainting can be caused by excessive parasympathetic and vagal activity that slows the heart and decreases perfusion of the brain.\\"Fainting,\\" WebMD, Updated Jan. 2, 2013. Accessed April 22, 2014. The sympathetic irritant effect is exploited to counteract these vagal parasympathetic effects and thereby reverse the faint.  Risks  Ammonia gas is toxic in large concentrations for prolonged periods and can be fatal. If a high concentration of ammonia is inhaled too close to the nostril, it might burn the nasal or oral mucosa. The suggested distance is . The use of ammonia smelling salts to revive people injured during sport is not recommended because it may inhibit or delay a proper and thorough neurological assessment by a healthcare professional, such as after concussions when hospitalization may be advisable, and some governing bodies recommend specifically against it. The irritant nature of smelling salts means that they can exacerbate any pre-existing cervical spine injury by causing reflex withdrawal away from them.

The parish is named after the Long Man of Wilmington, a chalk figure in the parish. The parish extends far from the left bank of the modest River Cuckmere where it starts to cut through the South Downs; after it is Cuckmere Valley immediately south. The A27 trunk road crosses the parish from west to east. The Wealdway long distance footpath also passes through the parish. Settlements =Wilmington= Ruins of Wilmington Priory It is about 6 miles north-west of Eastbourne. In Saxon times it was known as Wineltone; it was recorded in the Domesday Book. In the village there is the 12th-century Parish Church of St Mary and St Peter;Details and photographs of the church next to houses are the ruins of a 12th-century priory.Village notes included The local public house is The Giant's Rest. The Wishing Well Tea Gardens are one of the oldest in Sussex, established 1900.

The church is dedicated to St Peter ad Vincula.St Peter's church Current and former residents include David Dimbleby and Bridget Monckton. =Milton Street= This hamlet is home to the Sussex Ox pub. Milton Street was the setting of an episode of The Goon Show in which determined efforts are made to extinguish the sun. Landmarks Milton Gate Marsh, a Site of Special Scientific Interest, lies within the parish. It is a wetland area of biological importance for invertebrates and breeding birds. Amongst the fauna found here is the nationally rare hoverfly Cheilosia chrysocoma. The other SSSI is Wilmington Downs, which is of biological interest as an area of rare chalk grassland. The area is also of archaeological interest as it contains the Long Man chalk figure. Governance The lowest level of government is the Long Man parish council which meets once a month; is responsible for local amenities such as the provision of litter bins, bus shelters and allotments. They also provide a voice into the district council meetings. For elections, the parish is divided into three wards, Wilmington (four seats), Milton Street (two seats) and Folkington (one seat). The election on 3 May 2007 was uncontested in all three wards. Wealden District Council is the second tier of local government with services such as refuse collection, planning consent, leisure amenities and council tax collection. Long Man is in the East Dean ward, along with the Friston and Cuckmere Valley parishes. The single seat was won in the May 2007 election by the Conservative candidate. East Sussex County Council is the first tier of local government, providing education, libraries, social services and highways. Long Man falls within the Polegate, Willingdon and East Dean division which provides two councillors to the council.

Based on a concept developed by Clark and Ferdie Pacheco over a period of several years, it is set in West Virginia immediately after the end of the Civil War. Originally entitled Amen, it was conceived as a dark view of the difficulties Southerners faced dealing with carpetbaggers during the Reconstruction period, and also dealt with the problems of morphine-addicted Confederate soldiers returning home. It lost many of its serious overtones as the project evolved; Clark and Shipman's original book was revised substantially by Weldon (who also contributed the new title), and the plot became convoluted, often bordering on the ridiculous. Shipman later stated, \\"For all the faults there were in the original book . . . it was better than the hybrid we ended up with because it had passion.\\" The story centers on Abigail Kane, who journeys to America from her native England with her son Andy in search of her preacher husband, who allegedly had gone to the States to participate in the skirmish between North and South. She comes to the aid of the Major, a doctor struggling to care for a multitude of injured soldiers without the benefit of medical supplies, and soon discovers her missing husband is involved in shady dealings not usually associated with a man of the cloth. Drawn together out of both necessity and desire, Abigail and the Major forsake their marital vows and become involved in a passionate romance. Directed by Midgley, the musical premiered on October 25, 1989 at the Cambridge Arts Theatre in Cambridge, and in his review in the Cambridge Evening News, Alan Kersey wrote, \\"Petula Clark proved last night at the world premiere of Someone Like You that she can still work wonders both on stage and in the tough real world of show business.\\" The production toured the UK through December 9. On March 22, 1990, Someone Like You opened at the Strand Theatre in London's West End. In addition to Clark, it starred Dave Willetts (The Phantom of the Opera) as the Major and Clive Carter as Kane (roles in which Clark had hoped Andy Williams and Sting would be cast). Reviews were mixed, although most critics praised Clark's performance and her contribution to the score. Due to financial difficulties faced by producer Harold Fielding, all his assets were seized, and the show closed without warning after the April 25 performance. Although an original cast album was never released at the time, Clark's recordings of several of the tunes were issued on various CDs throughout the ensuing years. A studio recording of the score was released by Sepia Records in May 2007. With arrangements by the show's original musical director and arranger, Kenny Clayton, it features vocals by Debi Doss, Andrew Derbyshire, and Lewis Rae, who appeared in the original production as young Andy. Clayton is featured on piano and keyboards, with David Martin on guitar and Eric Young on percussion.

In 1992 the American record company Qbadisc began releasing albums by Los Mu√±equitos on CD in the United States, followed by a tour of the country for the first time. It was during this time that the group branched out and performed folkloric music and dance besides rumba, such as Lucum√≠, Palo, abaku√° and conga. The music of Los Mu√±equitos directly reflects the syncretism that exists in Cuba as sacred songs to the orishas often coexist with more secular themes and adaptations of Spanish songs in a single record or performance. In the late summer of 1994 Los Mu√±equitos joined the Cuban jazz ensemble Irakere on stage at the Banff Centre for the Arts to perform ‚ÄúXiomara.‚Äù‚ÄúXiomara‚Äù ¬°Afrocubanismo Live!, Bembe CD 2012-2 (1995).

The melodic conversations of the two, lower-pitched congas (salidor and segundo), eventually evolved into an extremely fluid style, that was more an approach than a composite of specific parts. The inventions of Los Mu√±equitos predates guarapachangeo and similar rumba creations emerging from in and around Havana in the late 1980s. In the late 1980s Los Mu√±equitos began incorporating break-downs, where the bottom end of the drum melody momentarily dropped out.‚ÄúLa pol√©mica‚Äù Rumba Caliente (Los Mu√±equitos de Matanzas) Qubadisc CD 9005 (1977, 1988). See: break-down at 3: 28, \\" La polemica\\" live in Puerto C√°rdenas, Matanzas, 25 April 1987. These breakdowns are similar to the breakdowns heard in the timba music that was emerging at the end of the 1980s, and which continue to this day. =Quinto= Los Mu√±equitos' style of playing quinto is also renown. They pioneered the style of an alternating tone-slap melody, that inverts with each cycle of clave (written as a single measure here).

He was best known by the ring name Hercules Hernandez or simply Hercules. Fernandez was also a featured bodybuilder, appearing in several muscle magazines.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career (1981‚Äì1983)= Fernandez started wrestling in 1981, mainly performing in the Florida and Texas territories, as \\"Hercules\\" Hernandez. In 1982, he joined the NWA Central States territory (which ran out of Kansas City and promoted shows in Kansas, Missouri, and Iowa). While in Central States, Hercules teamed up with Dewey Robertson, and the two won the Central States tag team championship on two occasions; they beat Mike George and Mark Romero both times. He also held the Central States Television title for a little over six months, winning it from, and losing it back to, his main rival, Romero. His two other notable feuds in the Central States territory were with Manny Fernandez and Harley Race. His feud with Race garnered Hernandez significant attention in the national wrestling scene, due to Race's stature as a former NWA World Champion. This feud began because Race had an issue with Oliver Humperdink's House of Humperdink stable, which Hernandez had become a part of soon after joining the promotion. One match between the two had the stipulation that if Race won, he would get five minutes inside a steel cage with Humperdink. Hercules was caught using brass knuckles and disqualified, which meant that the cage match was on. When the match was about to start, Hernandez ran to ringside, knocked Race out and threw him into the ring with Humperdink. In the end, Race recovered and delivered a piledriver to Humperdink onto a steel chair injuring (kayfabe) Humperdink and causing him to leave the territory. After losing his manager, Hernandez did not stay in the Central States territory for long but instead signed up with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP). = All Japan Pro Wrestling (1983) = In January 1983, Fernandez toured Japan with All Japan Pro Wrestling. = Jim Crockett Promotions (1983‚Äì1984) = In JCP, Fernandez was paired up with Jody Hamilton, who had been wrestling as the Masked Assassin; Fernandez became the Masked Assassin 2, a gimmick that had been played by several other wrestlers over the years. The two competed at the first ever Starrcade beating the team of Rufus R. Jones and Bugsy McGraw. Fernandez's run as one of the Assassins ended less than a year later, after he was unmasked by Jimmy Valiant. = Mid-South Wrestling (1984‚Äì1985) = After being unmasked, Fernandez moved on to Bill Watts' Mid-South promotion, where he once again donned a mask. Mr. Wrestling II had recently turned on his tag team partner Magnum T.A. and become a heel. Mr. Wrestling II renamed himself simply \\"Mr. Wrestling\\" and got a new prot√©g√©, \\"Mr. Wrestling II\\", who was Fernandez under a mask (referred to as \\"Mr. Wrestling III\\" in magazines to avoid confusing their readers). Mr. Wrestling II seconded Mr. Wrestling in his feud with Magnum T.A. Later on, Fernandez unmasked and competed once again as \\"Hercules Hernandez\\", and feuded with \\"Hacksaw\\" Jim Duggan under the tutelage of Jim Cornette. Hercules soon joined Skandor Akbar's stable, Devastation Inc., alongside future WWF co-worker Ted DiBiase. As part of Devastation Inc., Hercules feuded with the Junkyard Dog and Terry Taylor, before leaving for Florida. = Championship Wrestling from Florida (1985) = In \\"Championship Wrestling from Florida\\", Hercules quickly won the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship from Brian Blair, and then won the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship from Hector Guerrero the following month; this made him a double champion. Some time during July 1985, Fernandez was fired from CWF after a dressing room fight with Wahoo McDaniel and stripped of both titles. After leaving Florida, Fernandez went to World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico before signing with the World Wrestling Federation. = World Wrestling Federation (1985‚Äì1992) =  Early appearances (1985‚Äì1986)  Fernandez debuted in the WWF in 1985, managed by \\"Classy\\" Freddie Blassie. His first major national exposure came when he competed at WrestleMania 2 in a losing effort against Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat at the Sports Arena in the Los Angeles part of the show. Blassie soon retired. In storyline, he sold his stable to Slick and Fernandez soon found himself floundering in the WWF midcard.  The Heenan Family (1986‚Äì1988)  In late 1986, however, his contract was \\"sold\\" by Slick to fellow heel manager Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan. Soon after, he dropped \\"Hernandez\\" from his ringname (though some commentators such as Gorilla Monsoon still occasionally referred to him as Hernandez), as well as the Roman gladiator-style vest and wrist bands he wore during his ring entrance. He began carrying a long steel chain to the ring and re-emerged with a more muscular physique. On November 29, 1986 Saturday Night's Main Event VIII, Hercules received a shot at the WWF Heavyweight Championship, facing champion Hulk Hogan. Although he was able to put Hogan in the \\"Hercules backbreaker\\" torture rack, he lost by pinfall in what was arguably the biggest match of his wrestling career. Also in the fall of 1986, Hercules rekindled a feud with Billy Jack Haynes that went back through every promotion the two were ever in together, including the WWF earlier in 1986. As part of the feud, Hercules started using Haynes' finishing move, the full nelson submission hold, as his finisher. On an episode of WWF Wrestling Challenge, Heenan called out Haynes saying he would like to see him get out of Hercules' version of the hold. Haynes promptly answered the challenge and was waiting for Hercules to apply the hold when Heenan appeared to have second thoughts. Haynes grew tired of the charade and shoved Heenan. This gave Hercules the opening he needed to clothesline Haynes. Haynes was unable to defend himself and Hercules applied the full nelson. When Haynes began powering out of the hold, Heenan kicked him in the abdomen and Hercules released the hold. This incident set the stage for their match at WrestleMania III at the Pontiac Silverdome in front of a reported 93,173 fans. The momentum swung back and forth throughout the contest until Haynes attempted to apply the full nelson; both men tumbled to the floor after Hercules reached the ropes. Haynes applied the full nelson on the floor as both men were counted out. Heenan broke the hold by driving a knee into the back of Haynes, who then turned his attention to Heenan and chased him into the ring, allowing Hercules to blindside him with a shot to the head with his steel chain wrapped around his fist, causing Haynes to bleed profusely (a closeup shot of Haynes on the mat clearly showed him \\"blading\\" himself in order to draw blood). The feud culminated some weeks later in a chain match that saw Hercules as the victor. In the early part of 1988, during an episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling, Hercules was swinging his chain in the direction of another muscular power wrestler: the Ultimate Warrior. Warrior caught the chain, and the two began a tug of war, which led to the steel chain snapping at the middle. The broadcast commentators gave credit to the Warrior for snapping the chain, to the chagrin of Hercules and Heenan, though heel commentator Jesse Ventura contended that it took both Hercules and the Warrior to break the chain and not just the Warrior. This led to their grudge match at WrestleMania IV, which ended with Warrior pinning Hercules after pushing off from the turnbuckle while in Hercules' full nelson and landing on top of him before lifting his shoulder at the two count while referee Dave Hebner continued to count Hercules. During the match the Warrior had no-sold a number of Hercules' signature power moves, including receiving two clotheslines before being taken down with a third. This match has generally been regarded as one of the poorest matches in WrestleMania history.  Rivalry with Ted DiBiase and Bobby Heenan (1988‚Äì1990)  During the fall of 1988, Bobby Heenan sold Hercules' contract to Ted DiBiase; DiBiase claimed that in Hercules, he had now purchased his own slave. The would-be transaction failed because Hercules resisted the proceedings which angered him. He stated that he was owned by \\"no man\\" and instantly turned face to feud with DiBiase. Marking the end of ties for Heenan and Hercules, Bobby Heenan would from now as commentator and in promotions refer to Fernandez as Herc the Jerk. Hercules defeated DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil in a battle for his \\"freedom\\" on Saturday Night's Main Event XVIII on November 16 after DiBiase contended that he should not have to dirty his hands to beat his own slave. Hercules and DiBiase were later on opposite teams at the Survivor Series 1988 where DiBiase eliminated his Hercules from the contest, but Hercules then distracted DiBiase long enough to be eliminated by WWF World Champion Randy Savage who rolled him up for a pin while he was still gloating about eliminating Hercules. After the feud with DiBiase ended, Hercules had a series of matches with Haku (who was managed by Heenan). Despite pinning Haku at WrestleMania V, he did not become the \\"King\\" of the WWF. Hercules' career stalled following his feud with Haku. He was mainly used to help push the latest heels such as The Earthquake, who squashed him at WrestleMania VI.  Power and Glory (1990‚Äì1991)  In the summer of 1990, Hercules turned heel alongside Paul Roma and the two formed Power and Glory, managed by Slick. They had a high-profile feud with The Rockers, defeating them at SummerSlam in Philadelphia and challenged WWF World Tag Team Champions The Hart Foundation.  Final appearances (1991‚Äì1992)  After SummerSlam 1991, Roma left the WWF. Hercules spent the rest of his time in the WWF jobbing again, losing to wrestlers such as the Big Boss Man and Sid Justice, and Intercontinental champion Bret Hart. Hercules lasted nearly forty minutes in the 1991 Royal Rumble; in 1992, he lasted less than a minute. His last televised WWF match was against Sid Justice at Madison Square Garden where he was squashed in under a minute. A clearly frustrated and fed up Hercules took a Powerbomb from Justice followed by a three count before no- selling the move by simply getting up unhurt and heading for the locker room. = World Championship Wrestling (1992) = After being with the WWF for seven years, Fernandez signed with World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He once again adopted a masked persona, this time as Super Invader, a supposed oriental assassin under the management of former rival Harley Race. As Super Invader, he beat Todd Champion at WrestleWar 1992 and beat Marcus Bagwell in a dark match before the Great American Bash 1992. The highlight of his run as Super Invader was his appearance at Clash of the Champions XX teaming with Rick Rude, Jake Roberts, and Big Van Vader in an elimination tag team match against Sting, Nikita Koloff, and The Steiner Brothers. Although Sting eliminated him early, Super Invader's team won the match. By the end of 1992, Fernandez had left WCW. = New Japan Pro Wrestling (1993‚Äì1994) = In March 1993, Fernandez debuted in New Japan Pro Wrestling where he appeared as \\"Hercules Hernandez\\" once more, mainly teaming with fellow powerhouse wrestler Scott Norton to form The Jurassic Powers. They won the IWGP Tag Team Championship from the Hell Raisers (Hawk Warrior and Power Warrior) in August 1993 and held it for about four months before losing it back to the Hell Raisers at NJPW's January 4 Dome Show. While holding the title, the Jurassic Powers successfully defended against teams such as The Japanese Jollyjacks (Takayuki Iizuka and Akira Nogami), Masa Saito and Manabu Nakanishi, and the Barbarian and Haku. The team also had a series of matches with the Steiner Brothers and made it to the finals of the 1993 Super Grade Tag League where they lost to Keiji Mutoh and Hiroshi Hase. = Late career (1994‚Äì1999) = In 1994, Hercules wrestled in the American Wrestling Federation promotion taking part in the tournament to crown the first AWF champion. In 1999, Ray Fernandez retired from wrestling after working for various independent promotions across the world.  Death  Fernandez died in his sleep in his home on March 6, 2004. The cause of death was attributed to heart disease according to his wife.

Rude wrestled from 1982 until his 1994 retirement due to injury, with a final match following in 1997. Among other accolades, he was four time world champion three - time WCW International World Heavyweight Champion, a one-time WCWA World Heavyweight Champion, a one-time WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion, and a one-time WCW United States Heavyweight Champion. Rude also challenged for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on pay-per-view cards, competing for the former in the main event of SummerSlam in 1990. Following his retirement, Rude managed multiple wrestlers. In late 1997, Rude founded the D-Generation X stable alongside Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and Chyna. On November 17 of that year, in the midst of the Monday Night Wars, he became the only person to appear on the WWF's Raw and WCW's Monday Nitro programs on the same night, as the former was pre-recorded and Rude had left for WCW in the interim. He was posthumously inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017.  Early life  Rude was born in St. Peter, Minnesota to Richard Clyde Rood and Sally Jean Thompson. He attended Robbinsdale High School in Robbinsdale, Minnesota with Tom Zenk, Brady Boone, Nikita Koloff, Curt Hennig, John Nord, and Barry Darsow, all of whom later became professional wrestlers. He was especially close with his childhood friend Curt Hennig.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career (1982‚Äì1984) = After graduating from Anoka-Ramsey Community College with a degree in physical education, Rude trained as a wrestler under Eddie Sharkey. He began wrestling in 1982 as Ricky Rood, a babyface jobber. Rude lost his TV debut against Jos LeDuc on the November 6, 1982 episode of Mid Atlantic Championship Wrestling.WWE Network He started with Vancouver's NWA: All-Star Wrestling before moving on to compete for Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) and later the Memphis-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA). Rude debuted on the May 28, 1983 episode of World Championship Wrestling, defeating Pat Rose with a dropkick. Gordon Solie interviewed Rude the following week, with Rude discussing transitioning from arm wrestling to pro wrestling and dropping weight to increase speed. He later left and joined the National Wrestling Alliance having debuted in WCCW in a match against Kamala that he lost, and then went on to (NWA) affiliate Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) where he and a variety of tag team partners feuded with The Road Warriors. He returned to Memphis in 1984, this time as \\"Ravishing\\" Rick Rude, an overconfident, arrogant heel managed by Jimmy Hart. Rude feuded with Jerry Lawler and later his former partner, King Kong Bundy. = Championship Wrestling from Florida (1984‚Äì1985) = Rude was hired by Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF) in December 1984, where he was managed by Percy Pringle. He defeated Pez Whatley for the NWA Florida Southern Heavyweight Championship on January 16, 1985 and lost it to Brian Blair on April 10, 1985. He captured the championship again on July 20, 1985, when he defeated Mike Graham in the finals of a Southern title tournament. He held the belt until October 2 of that year when he dropped it to Wahoo McDaniel, who was booking Florida during this time. While teaming with Jesse Barr, he won the NWA Florida United States Tag Team Championship on April 16, 1985, and feuded with Billy Jack Haynes and Wahoo McDaniel over the belts, losing the straps to McDaniel and Haynes on July 9, 1985. = World Class Championship Wrestling (1985‚Äì1986) = Debuting on October 18, 1985, Rude jumped to World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) along with Pringle, where he feuded with Kevin Von Erich and Chris Adams. During his time in WCCW, Rude captured the NWA American Heavyweight Championship on November 4, 1985. However, WCCW withdrew from the NWA on February 20, 1986, and changed its name to the World Class Wrestling Association (WCWA). The NWA American Championship was renamed the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship while Rude was still holding the title. As a result, Rude became the promotion's first world champion. After losing the title to Chris Adams in July 1986, he fired Pringle and briefly replaced him with his sister, Raven. He formed a short-lived tag team with The Dingo Warrior, but the Warrior turned on him and became a face. = Jim Crockett Promotions (1986‚Äì1987) = In September 1986, Rude returned to JCP and joined Manny Fernandez and his manager Paul Jones in their rivalry with Wahoo McDaniel. Rude and Fernandez, known collectively as the \\"Awesome Twosome\\", won the NWA World Tag Team Championship on December 6, 1986 from The Rock 'n' Roll Express, and they began a feud that ended only when Rude left the promotion for the World Wrestling Federation in April 1987. To explain the sudden departure, Jim Crockett, Jr. aired a pre-taped non-title match where the Express defeated Rude and Fernandez and claimed that Rude had been injured as a result. = World Wrestling Federation (1987‚àí1990)=  Debut (1987-1988)  Rude made his World Wrestling Federation (WWF) debut on Superstars Of Wrestling on July 15, 1987 as the newest addition to the Bobby Heenan Family. His first feud in the WWF was with Heenan's former muscle bound charge \\"Mr. Wonderful\\" Paul Orndorff (who Heenan had dropped after Rude joined the Family), before starting one of his most famous feuds with Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts. Rude had a routine where, before the match, he would make a show of removing his robe while insulting the males in the crowd (usually calling them \\"fat, out-of-shape sweathogs\\") and, after his victories, he would kiss a woman whom Heenan selected from the audience. One of Rude's trademarks was his specially airbrushed tights that he wore during matches. In the Roberts angle, Rude tried to get Roberts' real-life wife, Cheryl, to participate (though not knowing when Heenan chose her that she was in fact Roberts' wife). After Mrs. Roberts rejected him and revealed who she was there to see, Rude became angry (after she slapped him), grabbed her wrist, and berated her on the microphone when Roberts ran from the dressing room to make the save. To retaliate a few days later, Rude came to the ring with a likeness of Cheryl stenciled on the front of his tights. A furious Roberts charged the ring and stripped Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave him naked (as indicated by black-spot censoring Rude's genital area), although the live audience saw him actually stripped to a g-string. Through mid-1988 Rude continued to wear a second pair of tights under the one he wore to the ring, including during his match against the Junkyard Dog at the inaugural SummerSlam at Madison Square Garden. During the match Rude had the JYD on his back and had climbed to the top turnbuckle. While up there he pulled down his tights to reveal a second with Cheryl Roberts printed on them. After hitting the Dog with a flying fist, he was attacked by Roberts who had seen the action from the dressing room. Roberts attack on Rude caused the JYD to be disqualified, giving Rude the win. Rude's feud with Roberts came to its conclusion when Roberts pinned Rude following a DDT during the 1988 Survivor Series.  Intercontinental Champion and departure (1989-1990)  Rude's next big feud was with The Ultimate Warrior and began in January at the 1989 Royal Rumble pay-per-view in a \\"Super Posedown\\" that ended with Rude attacking Warrior with a metal pose bar. With help from Heenan, Rude won the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship from The Ultimate Warrior at WrestleMania V, before dropping it back to Warrior at SummerSlam that same year, due in large part to interference from \\"Rowdy\\" Roddy Piper. Rude then feuded with Piper which led to a conflict between their respective teams at the 1989 Survivor Series in which both men brawled to a double count-out. Rude would go on to have many matches with Piper including inside a steel cage, losing the majority of them, before having a brief program against Jimmy Snuka getting a win over him at WrestleMania 6. Rude resumed his conflict with The Ultimate Warrior in the summer of 1990 after Warrior had won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Rude began rigorous training in preparation for the Warrior, and took a more serious approach by neglecting women and cutting his hair short (a style he would maintain for the rest of his career). The feud culminated in a steel cage at SummerSlam 1990; wherein, Rude was defeated by the Warrior. Next, he was scheduled to feud with Big Boss Man, which had its start when Rude's manager Bobby Heenan started to make degrading comments about Boss Man's mother. Rude would later backup the statements and call out the Boss Man. Rude was scheduled to be a part of a team called the Natural Disasters at the Survivor Series, consisting of Earthquake, Dino Bravo, and The Barbarian against Hulk Hogan and Boss Man's team, but was replaced by Haku after being suspended indefinitely by Jack Tunney. Tunney explained that Rude's comments towards the Boss Man were the reason for his suspension and that his manager Bobby Heenan was obligated to wrestle the Boss Man in his place. In reality Rude had a dispute with WWF owner Vince McMahon that led to him leaving the company. = Freelance (1991) = After leaving the WWF, Rude attempted to join Herb Abram's UWF. Still under contract with the WWF, his former company sent a cease and desist order that prevented Rude from appearing on UWF television. He would not wrestle again until May 18th, 1991, when he appeared at the TWA Spring Spectacular II event held by the Tri-State Wrestling Alliance in Philadelphia, PA. He faced Paul Orndorff and lost by disqualification.https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr;=21078 Two months later he joined All Japan Pro Wrestling for their Summer Action Series 1991, making his initial appearance on July 6, 1991 at a show in Yokosuka, Japan. In his first match on the tour, he teamed with Johnny Ace to defeat Billy Black and Joel Deaton. In singles matches Rude was undefeated, beating Isamu Teranishi and Akira Taue. His final appearance came on July 19th, where he teamed with Johnny Ace in a losing effort to Dan Spivey and Stan Hansen. = World Championship Wrestling (1991‚àí1994)=  The Dangerous Alliance and United States Heavyweight Champion (1991-1993)  After spending a year wrestling on select shows on the independent circuit, as well as a July 1991 tour for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), Rude returned to WCW, which had originally been JCP prior to being sold to Ted Turner in late 1988; he returned under a mask as The WCW Phantom at Halloween Havoc on October 27, 1991, unmasking himself later that night. He led The Dangerous Alliance, consisting of himself, Paul E. Dangerously, Madusa, Arn Anderson, Bobby Eaton, Larry Zbyszko, and \\"Stunning\\" Steve Austin. On November 19, 1991, Rude defeated Sting for the United States Heavyweight Championship and engaged in a number of high-profile feuds, including one with Ricky Steamboat. At one point during their feud, Steamboat suffered a kayfabe broken nose in a gang attack. In 1992, Rude and Madusa left The Dangerous Alliance and feuded with Nikita Koloff. Rude challenged reigning World Heavyweight Champion Ron Simmons on several occasions but failed to win the title. In December 1992, Rude suffered a legitimate neck injury and was forced to forfeit the United States Championship, thus ending his reign of nearly 14 months, a reign that still stands today as the second longest reign in the almost 40-year history of the title. Rude returned alone in April 1993 and tried to reclaim the title from Dustin Rhodes, who had won it while he was injured. The title was eventually held up after several controversial finishes to matches between the two. After a 30-minute Iron Man Match ended in a 1-1 draw at Beach Blast on July 18, a best-of-three series was set between the two on Saturday Night; Rude won the first match on August 28, but lost to Rhodes twice on September 4 and 11, losing his chance at regaining the United States Heavyweight Championship.  International World Heavyweight Champion and retirement (1993-1994)  Rude switched his sights to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, making his intentions clear on August 28, 1993, when he was the guest on then-champion Ric Flair's \\"A Flair For the Gold\\" talk segment. Rude defeated Flair for the title in September 1993 at Fall Brawl. As WCW had recently withdrawn from the NWA, WCW lost the rights to continue using the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. WCW created their own championship, dubbing it the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, which Rude lost to Hiroshi Hase on March 16, 1994 in Tokyo, Japan. Rude regained the title just eight days later in Kyoto, Japan. After dropping the title to Sting on April 17 at Spring Stampede, Rude pinned Sting on May 1 at Wrestling Dontaku in Fukuoka to become a three-time champion. Rude, however, injured his back during the match when, upon receiving a suicide dive at ringside, he landed on the corner of the raised platform surrounding the ring; unable to wrestle, he was stripped of the title (with the storyline excuse that he was found to have used the title belt as a weapon in the course of the match). Rude retired shortly thereafter. = Extreme Championship Wrestling (1997) = Rude collected on a Lloyd's of London insurance policy and did not appear in wrestling again until early 1997, when he joined Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) as a masked man who harassed Shane Douglas, at one point spanking Francine during Crossing the Line Again. He eventually unmasked and became a color commentator before later aligning himself, for a short time, with Douglas and his Triple Threat stable. In the main event of ECW Heat Wave 1997, Rude made a one-off return to the ring in a six-man tag team match, where he partnered with ECW mainstays Tommy Dreamer and The Sandman to face Jerry Lawler and ECW stars Rob Van Dam and Sabu. During the ECW versus USWA/WWF inter-company competition, Rude helped Lawler win matches against Dreamer and The Sandman. = Return to the WWF (1997) = On August 11, 1997, Rude returned to the WWF as the \\"insurance policy\\" of the group that would become known as D-Generation X (DX) (Shawn Michaels, Triple H, and Chyna). The D-Generation X name was first used on October 13, 1997. As a member of DX, Rude never wrestled, but stayed ringside during the group's matches. A few days after the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series, Rude once again left the WWF. According to Bret Hart, Rude stayed in the locker room during Bret's confrontation with Vince McMahon after the match in Montreal, and later called Eric Bischoff, informing Bischoff that what had happened was in fact real. Rude was not signed to a full-time contract with the WWF, and was instead performing on a \\"pay-per-appearance\\" basis, Rude was able to negotiate a deal with Bischoff and WCW, in large part due to his anger over the Montreal Screwjob. = Return to WCW (1997‚Äì1999) = Rude appeared on both the WWF's Raw Is War and WCW's Monday Nitro in the same night on November 17, 1997. A mustached Rude appeared on Nitro, which was live, and proceeded to criticize Vince McMahon, Shawn Michaels, DX, and the WWF, calling the company the \\"Titanic\\" (a reference to Titan Sports, as WWF's parent company was then known, as the \\"sinking ship\\"). An hour later on Raw Is War (which had been taped six days earlier), Rude then appeared with the full beard he had been sporting during his last few weeks in the WWF. Rude also appeared on ECW's Hardcore TV during that weekend (November 14‚Äì16 as the show was syndicated differently depending on the market). Rude was still making ECW appearances while he was in D-Generation X, as the WWF and ECW often co-operated in terms of talent. In WCW, Rude became a member of the New World Order (nWo), managing his friend Curt Hennig. Thus, Rude became the first wrestler to be part of both DX and nWo. When the nWo split, Hennig and Rude initially sided with the nWo Wolfpac during May 1998. But their time with the \\"Red & Black\\" was very brief. At The Great American Bash, they turned on fellow Wolfpac member Konnan by attacking him after he lost to the then-undefeated Goldberg, resulting in Hennig and Rude both joining nWo Hollywood instead. By late 1998, both Rude and Hennig were off WCW television due to injuries. Hennig had an ongoing leg injury that year, and Rude was thought to have had testicular cancer which later turned out to be a spermatocele. Hennig returned to the nWo from his injury at Starrcade without Rude, who was still unable to appear and was not included in the nWo reunion that happened during January 1999. Rude officially left WCW in March 1999.  Personal life Rood married his wife Michelle in 1988, and the couple remained together until his death in 1999. They had three children together, Richard Jr., Merissa, and Colton. His youngest son, Colton, died on September 3, 2016, in a motorcycle accident in Rome, Georgia, at the age of 19. Bret Hart has stated that Rude was a devoted family man who never took his wedding ring off even during matches but instead covered it up with tape. Hart also stated that Rude, along with Curt Hennig, was one of the greatest technical wrestlers of his era.  Death  Rude was found unconscious by his wife and died on the morning of April 20, 1999 at the age of 40 when he suffered from heart failure. An autopsy report showed he died from an overdose of \\"mixed medications\\". At the time of his death, Rude was in training for a return to the ring.  Legacy  Rude also was a noted arm wrestler, finishing sixth in the world championships in Las Vegas in the light heavyweight division in 1983. On March 6, 2017, it was announced that Rick Rude would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame. Ricky \\"The Dragon\\" Steamboat inducted Rude. Michelle, Merissa, and Richard Jr. accepted on his behalf.

He served as President of the Senate for two years. In both the 2002 and 2004 congressional elections, Matsunaka lost to Republican Marilyn Musgrave for the 4th District of Colorado in the United States House of Representatives. Matsunaka is a Japanese American native of Akron, Colorado, whose grandparents settled in the state in the early 20th century. He grew up in rural Morgan County near Fort Morgan and is a graduate of Colorado State University. Matsunaka later moved to Loveland and was elected to the Colorado State Senate. In 2002, Matsunaka ran against fellow state senator Musgrave for the open seat in the 4th District, which includes the cities of Greeley, Loveland, Longmont, and Fort Collins, as well much of the Colorado Eastern Plains; he lost to Musgrave 42%-55%. In 2004, he again challenged Musgrave, now the incumbent, who had attracted controversy in the district for her sponsorship of the Federal Marriage Amendment. In addition to his accusation that Musgrave is a \\"one trick pony,\\" Matsunaka also claimed that Musgrave had poor constituent services and did not give enough attention to the district's needs. This time, the election was far closer and was not decided until the last returns came in. Musgrave won by six points (51-45%) -- the closest margin in the district since 1974. Matsunaka won two of the three biggest counties in the district -- Larimer County (including Loveland and Fort Collins) and the district's share of Boulder County (including Longmont). However, Musgrave soundly defeated him in Weld County (including Greeley); he would have unseated Musgrave had he won there. Despite the surprisingly close 2004 results, Matsunaka ruled out another run. Now an attorney in private practice in Loveland, Matsunaka was an advisor to Ed Perlmutter's successful 2006 campaign for Colorado's 7th congressional district. He is married with three grown children, Melissa, Brian, and Kristi.

Membership recomposes annually with sixteen Yale University students, typically rising seniors. The delegation spends its year together answerable to an alumni association. Though Yale now counts upwards of 40 societies or similarly organized social clubs active on campus, Wolf's Head is considered a desirable one and relevant among current undergraduates.\\"Dear Wolf's Head\\", Blog, Yale Daily News, 02 May 2013, article \\"New book ignites society debate\\", Britton O'Daly, Yale Daily News, 5 Oct, 2017\\"The Choice is Yours\\", Blog, Yale Daily News, 24 February 2017 The society was founded fifty years after the establishment of Skull and Bones Society. Fifteen rising seniors from the Yale Class of 1884, with help from members of the Yale Class of 1883 who were considered publicly possible taps for the older societies, chose to abet the creation of The Third Society. The society changed its name to Wolf's Head five years later.Andrews, John. History of the Founding of Wolf's Head, Lancaster Press, 1934.

The founding defeated the last attempt by the administration or the student body to abolish secret or senior societies at Yale.Richards, David Alan. Skulls and Keys, Pegasus Books, Ltd. NY, NY, 2017, pp. 284 - 327, \\"The Solution of Wolf's Head (1883 - 1888)\\" pp. 284 - 327. The tradition continued of creating and sustaining a society if enough potential rising seniors thought they had been overlooked: Bones was established in 1832 after a dispute over selections for Phi Beta Kappa awards; Scroll and Key Society, the second society at Yale, was established in 1841 after a dispute over elections to Bones. The Third Society's founding was motivated in part by sentiment among some young men that they deserved insider status. \\"[A] certain limited number were firmly convinced that there had been an appalling miscarriage of justice in their individual omission from the category of the elect,\\" some founders agreed.\\"Changes in Skull and Bones, Famous Yale Society Doubles Size of its House - Addition a Duplicate of Old Building\\".

By the 1830s, the campus literary societies Linonia, Brothers in Unity, and Calliopean had lost stature. Calliopean folded in 1853, and the others shut down after the American Civil War.Secrets of the Tomb, pp. 36, 38. Calliopean, Linonia, and Brothers in Unity existed respectively: 1819‚Äì1853, 1768‚Äì1878, and 1735‚Äì1868. From the mid-1840s until 1883, several societies were started, but each failed to sustain the interest of Academical Department, or liberal arts, students at Yale College.Robbins, Alexandra.

In the 1820s, Anti-Masonic agitation across the United States prompted PBK to examine the role of secrecy in its proceedings. Secrecy was soon shelved at the Yale chapter. Associated with PBK's national reorganization in 1881, secrecy disappeared as a signature among all chapters, quelling rivalry with collegiate fraternities, clubs and societies. PBK exists today, without any secrecy, as an academic honor society. Beginning in the 1850s, the Yale undergraduate student body grew more diverse. The college was becoming an institution of national rather than regional importance. Students who hailed from environs beyond New England or who were not Congregationalist or Presbyterian entered the college in large numbers.Stephenson, Louise L. Scholarly Means to Evangelical Ends: The New Haven Scholars and the Transformation of Higher Learning in America.The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986, p. 64; . The faculty and administration were dominated by alumni of Bones, numbering four out of five faculty members between 1865 and 1916. Bones alumni were university secretaries from 1869 to 1921. Bones alumni were university treasurers for forty-three of the forty- eight years between 1862 - 1910.Secrets of the Tomb. pp. 48, 50, 127.Joining the Club. p. 26. Five of the first six Yale Corporation elected Alumni Fellows were members of Bones.Skulls and Keys, p. xix In 1873, The Iconoclast, a student paper published once, 13 October, advocated for the abolition of the society system. It opined: \\"Out of every class Skull and Bones takes its men...They have obtained control of Yale. Its business is performed by them. Money paid to the college must pass into their hands, and be subject to their will....It is Yale College against Skull and Bones!!

It had been understood that the society system was beyond reform and might well be abolished. A spirited defense of the society system appeared in the May 1884 issue of The New Englander, written and published by members of Scroll and Key. Several periodicals reported regularly on the situation.Andrews, pp. 58-61. Establishment The initial delegation, including ten Class Day officers from the Class of 1884 and led by Edwin Albert Merritt, met in secret during their senior year with the aid of members of the Class of 1883 who were \\"eager to start a society provided the evil features of the old societies would be eliminated. [The graduating and rising seniors] were unanimous on this point.\\" Included among the supporters from the Class of 1883 were members touted as sure selections to Bones or Keys by the publishers of the Horoscope, an undergraduate publication that provided feature material on the most likely taps. The pro-society seniors won the Class Day vote, 67 - 50.Andrews, p. 70. The new society was conceived on or about June 5, 1883. Among undergraduates the fledgling group was known as the \\"Fox and Grapes\\" for the Aesopian fable of jealousy.Skulls and Keys, p.293 and p.292 The two older societies suffered by comparison with Wolf's Head.Skulls and Keys, p. 320 The New Haven Register reported in 1886: \\"Wolf's Head is not as far out of the world, in respect to its public doings, as are [Bones and Keys]. There is a sufficient veil of secrecy drawn around its mechanism, however, to class it with the secret societies, and this gives it a stability and respectability in Yale College circles that it might not have otherwise....\\"Secrets of the Tomb, p. 63. The society was managed similarly to finals clubs associated with the Sheffield Scientific School; however, it soon took on almost all aspects of the older societies. Early stature The Third Society sat at the apex of a social pyramid bricked by junior societies (sophomore societies were abolished in 1875, freshman societies in 1880),Andrews, p. 46. campus organizations, athletic teams, clubs, and fraternities.Kabaservice, Geoffrey. The Guardians: Kingman Brewster, His Circle, and the Rise of the Liberal Establishment. Henry Holt and Company, New York, 2004. p. 45. . In 1888, the society changed its name to Wolf's Head Society, consonant with the approval among undergraduates of the society's pin, a stylized wolf's head on an inverted ankh, an Egyptian hieroglyphic known as the Egyptian Cross or \\"the key of life\\". The earliest undergraduate members allowed fellow schoolmates to handle the pin, a specific refutation of pin display by the older societies. Eternal life is symbolized rather than death or erudition. A Roman fasces had been considered as a design element for the pin.Secrets of the Tomb. p. 68. Point of view Many pioneering and subsequent members mocked as \\"poppycock\\" (from the Dutch for \\"soft excrement\\") the seemingly Masonic-inspired rituals and atmosphere associated with Skull and Bones. In their The Pirates of Penzance prank, Wolf's Head members persuaded the thespian pirate king to display the numbers 322 (part of the emblem of Skull and Bones) below a skull and crossbones at a local theatre.Secrets of the Tomb, pp. 3-4, 67, 84-85. In another example, Yale President A. Whitney Griswold's deprecated the rituals as \\"bonesy bullshit\\" and \\"Dink Stover crap\\" coloring undergraduate life.The Guardians. p. 155. Wolf's Head did maintain many traditional practices, such as the Thursday and Sunday meetings, which were common among its peers. Paul Moore, Jr., long-time Senior Fellow and successor trustee (1964 - 1990) for the Yale Corporation and long-tenured bishop in the Episcopal Church (United States), recalled the night before he first encountered combat in World War II: \\"I spent the evening on board ship being quizzed by [a friend from Harvard] about what went on in Wolf's Head. He could not believe I would hold back such irrelevant secrets the night before I faced possible death.\\"Yale officers: Founding Trustees and their successors,[www.guides.library.yale.edu]Moore, Paul.

Currently houses the Yale Institution for Social and Policy Studies. A building with narrow windows, the \\"Old Hall\\" was noted as \\"the most modern and handsomest\\" of the society domiciles by The New York Times in 1903. The building was erected in 1884 soon after the founding members secured financing. *Bertram Goodhue, architect, designed \\"New Hall\\", ca. 1924; built posthumously. Goodhue was a protege of James Renwick Jr., architect of the first St. Anthony Hall chapter house in New York City. The building has stone wall and wrought iron fencing, and is central to the largest secret society compound on campus. The compound commands the most prominent location on campus beyond Harkness Tower, the very icon of Yale, and the Memorial Quadrangle. The \\"New Hall\\" opened in the mid 1920s and sits fronted by York Street surrounded by the Yale Daily News Briton Hadden Memorial building, and the Yale Drama School and theatre, both gifts to Yale from Edward Harkness.Kelley, Brooks Mather.Yale: A History, Yale University Press, New Haven and London. p. 374. .

It consisted of a very powerful incandescent lamp enclosed in a metallic cylinder. One of the two semi-cylindrical sides constitutes the reflector, and the other, which is of thick glass, allows the passage of light, which illuminates the strata of earth traversed by the instrument. The base, which is inclined at an angle of 45¬∞, is an elliptical mirror, and the top, of straight section, is open in order to permit the observer standing at the mouth of the well, and provided with a powerful spyglass, to see in the mirror the image of the earth. The lamp is so mounted that its upwardly emitted rays are intercepted. The whole apparatus was suspended from a long cable, formed of two conducting wires, which winds around a windlass with metallic journals which are electrically insulated. These journals communicate, through the intermedium of two friction springs, with the conductors on the one hand and, on the other, with the poles of an automatic and portable battery. This permits of lowering and raising the apparatus at will, without derangement, and without its being necessary to interrupt the light and the observation. The erygmascope was described in an 1891 edition of the Scientific American Supplement; it is uncertain of the extent to which it was ever put to practical use.

It consists of irradiation of the patient with the UVA band of ultraviolet light (fairly closely matching the ultraviolet output from the sun), usually delivered from a fluorescent bulb specially designed to output this frequency of ultraviolet. This treatment is similar to the light from good quality solariums but differs from the mainly UVB ultraviolet band used to treat psoriasis. Tanning beds are used both in dermatology practices for the treatment of cosmetic skin conditions (such as psoriasis, acne, eczema and vitiligo) and in indoor tanning salons for cosmetic tanning. At least 88 percent of dermatologists recommend the usage of tanning equipment or salon tanning for clients to inexpensively self- treat skin conditions as a convenient alternative for clients in rural locations, as well as naturally occurring exposures including ultraviolet light from the sun. Typical treatment regimens involve short exposure to UVB rays 3 to 5 times a week at a hospital or clinic, and repeated sessions may be required before results are noticeable. Almost all of the conditions that respond to UVB light are chronic problems, so continuous treatment is required to keep those problems in check. Home UVB systems are common solutions for those whose conditions respond to treatment. Home systems permit patients to treat themselves every other day (the ideal treatment regimen for most) without the frequent, costly trips to the office/clinic and back. Side effects Side-effects may include itching and redness of the skin due to UVB exposure, and possibly sunburn, if patients do not minimize exposure to natural UV rays during treatment days. Cataracts can frequently develop if the eyes are not protected from UVB light exposure. To date, there is no link between an increase in a patient's risk of skin cancer and the proper use of narrow-band UVB phototherapy. \\"Proper use\\" is generally defined as reaching the \\"Sub-Erythemic Dose\\" (S.E.D.), the maximum amount of UVB your skin can receive without burning. Certain fungal growths under the toenail can be treated using a specific wavelength of UV delivered from a high-power LED (light-emitting diode) and can be safer than traditional systemic drugs. Phototherapy for neonatal jaundice in infants uses blue light, not UV. Commercial tanning beds as alternative treatment Phototherapy is used for many dermatologic conditions. However, the time and expense can be a burden and obstacle for many patients. For patients with psoriasis, the use of tanning beds can be beneficial. (Psoriasis is a skin condition with symptoms of red flaky skin). Commercial tanning facilities offer an alternative means of phototherapy outside of a doctor's office. Tanning beds at commercial facilities are already being used by people with psoriasis; a survey showed that 36% of patients have tried commercial tanning beds to treat their psoriasis. Tanning beds are, in fact, the most common form of phototherapy. However, there are risks to using tanning beds. Too much exposure to artificial UV light increases the risk of skin cancer. There are other side effects and risks from too much UV exposure, as well. People with lighter skin should take caution before using a tanning bed. Other issues include the UVA and UVB wavelength variable: there are many models of tanning beds, and it is highly variable among them as to what the combination of UVA and UVB wavelengths are used. UVA is primarily what tanning beds emit. UVA penetrates deeper into the skin, is less likely to cause sunburn, but increases the risk of skin cancer and melanoma. One concern is that tanning beds that primarily emit UVA cannot be effective for the treatment of psoriasis. Other limitations to the use of tanning beds for the treatment of skin conditions include the imprecise output of the lamps and beds, imprecise spectral targeting of commercial tanning beds, the fact that the patient or non-medical staff run the machines, and other acute or long-term side effects.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 to 2014, representing the riding of Oshawa. He served in the cabinet in the government of Ernie Eves. Background Ouellette was born in Oshawa, Ontario. He graduated from Durham College in business administration. He managed a lumber operation and a national consulting firm. Ouellette is a former member of the governing board of Durham College, and a member of the Oshawa Naval Veterans Association. Politics Ouellette was elected to the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1995, defeating incumbent New Democrat Allan Pilkey in Oshawa by about 8,000 votes. He was re-elected by about 7,000 votes over Liberal Chris Topple in the 1999 provincial election, with the NDP falling to third place. He was re-elected in 2003, 2007, and 2011. Ouellette supported Ernie Eves in the Progressive Conservative Party's 2002 leadership convention, and on April 15, 2002, was appointed Ontario Minister of Natural Resources. In this capacity, he was generally regarded as an ally of the province's fishing and hunting community. In the 2003 provincial election, Ouellette faced a strong challenge from provincial union representative and NDP candidate Sid Ryan. This was Ryan's third unsuccessful bid for a provincial seat (1999, Scarborough-Centre; 2003 and 2007, Oshawa) and his fifth electoral loss having been twice defeated by Colin Carrie, Oshawa's Conservative candidate and MP, in 2004 and 2006. Ouellette struggled to retain his seat, winning the 2003 race by 1,019 votes. But the Progressive Conservatives lost the election and Ouellette moved to the opposition benches. Four years later, during the 2007 provincial election, Ouellette defeated Ryan a second time. He was re-elected in the 2011 provincial election.

It reached #1 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart, and #59 on the Billboard 200 album chart. The hit single from the album, \\"Low,\\" helped Cracker gain widespread notice. According to frontman David Lowery, the album title comes from the band's early days in Richmond, Virginia. Lowery lived with Cracker guitarist Johnny Hickman in an old dilapidated house whose only source of heat came from two kerosene heaters. To buy more kerosene meant a cold walk to a nearby gas station, so before leaving the house, Lowery would bundle up and put on an old wool hunting cap ‚Äì his \\"kerosene hat.\\" \\"To this day,\\" says Lowery, \\"the smell of kerosene reminds me of the poverty and the wistful hope we had for our music.\\" Background and recording notes Following the release of their debut album ‚Äì which went gold ‚Äì Cracker entered the studio in 1992 intending to record their next album completely live to tape. This idea was eventually scrapped, but four live-in- the-studio tracks were released later that same year as the Tucson EP. Seeking a new recording location away from the distractions of Los Angeles and their record company, the band scouted out a few sites, including a Palm Springs house that once belonged to Frank Sinatra. Eventually they happened upon a derelict soundstage in Pioneertown, California, which was part of an old movie set once used to shoot Western films and TV shows. As Johnny Hickman recalls: \\"It really wasn't that much of a sound stage. It was more of a barn. There were holes in the wall you could see through and it was just a huge, huge barn basically. But it was just big enough to open the doors and drive a mobile recording truck into. So we got all of our equipment and the truck into the barn and shut the door and for the next six weeks proceeded to make Kerosene Hat.\\" Recording took place from Feb. 25 to March 25 1993. The weather was cold, and the band salvaged old mattresses and other material from the junkyard to insulate the makeshift studio. Song notes The leadoff track from the album, \\"Low,\\" had an immediate impact on the album's success. After Hickman started playing the song's signature riff during a soundcheck in Portland, Oregon, the song came together very quickly. Upon release it became ‚Äì as noted by Spin ‚Äì \\"a ubiquitous signpost of the alternative-as-the-new- mainstream era\\". Author David Maine calls \\"Low\\" the signature song of the Summer of 1993, as rock radio added it to heavy rotation and the band's visibility increased. It peaked at #3 on the Modern Rock Radio charts. The track \\"Whole Lotta Trouble,\\" recorded during the Kerosene Hat sessions and released as the b-side of the \\"Low\\" CD single, was also featured on the soundtrack of the 1995 Gen-X film Empire Records. Contributing to the song's success was a noir-ish, black-and-white video shot by director Carlos Grasso, which was added to MTV's Buzz Bin. In the video, Lowery spars with comedian Sandra Bernhard in a boxing ring and gets knocked out. Grasso claims that during the video shoot, Lowery insisted that Bernhard's punches be real - which meant his face was \\"all puffy\\" from the hits by the end of the shoot. Lowery described \\"Low\\" as \\"part Wizard of Oz, part Flowers of Evil\\", while NME called it \\"grunge noir\\". Due to perceived drug references in the song's lyrics, Lowery was asked by Virgin Records to write a letter to radio stations swearing that there was nothing drug-related about the song at all. According to the letter, the lyric \\"being stoned\\" was actually \\"being stone\\". The second single from the album, \\"Get Off This,\\" was written in response to naysayers who accused Cracker of selling out and making music that was more mainstream than Lowery's previous band, Camper Van Beethoven. Thematically speaking, the song declares the band's independence and desire to write songs that come from an honest place. The song peaked at #6 on the Modern Rock Radio charts. Written in a New Jersey hotel room, \\"Eurotrash Girl\\" tells the story of a lonely young man in Europe who suffers through a series of humiliating episodes. Lowery created the song's central character and the other band members suggested additional ideas to the story. Having spent time in Europe, Hickman noted mischievously: \\"Some of these things [in the song] happened to us, some not.\\" Even before Kerosene Hat was released, the song had become a live fan favorite. So despite protests from Virgin Records of putting too much material on the album, the band surreptitiously included the song, along with \\"I Ride My Bike,\\" as hidden tracks during mastering. It was producer Don Smith's idea to make \\"Eurotrash Girl\\" track 69. \\"Sick of Goodbyes\\" was co- written with Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, and was later re-recorded and released as a single from that band's album, Good Morning Spider. The final song on the album proper, \\"Loser,\\" is a Grateful Dead cover. Jerry Garcia once told Lowery and Hickman that he approved of their version of the song. Legacy In the post-Nirvana climate of early '90s alternative music, Kerosene Hat went platinum and would be Cracker's most popular album to date. Twenty years after the album's release, webzine Spectrum Culture noted, \\"In the cases when both music and lyrics are on the mark ‚Äì and there are many ‚Äì the record achieves something close to greatness.\\" Says Lowery: \\"We've always been a country roots-rock band. We've always leaned on American roots stuff, whether it's soul, blues or country... Fortunately, our sound somehow fit into modern rock radio back when grunge had taken over the entire world.\\" Hickman adds, \\"We kind of snuck in the back door by being a band that had something to say and were lucky enough to write a catchy three-minute song.\\" Pioneertown, where Kerosene Hat was recorded, still holds a special place for the band members, as Cracker hosts a music festival there each year. In 2011, the band paid tribute to its landmark album by performing it live in its entirety.

It is situated on the south-west bank of the Humber Estuary, and is north-west from Grimsby. The region was relatively unpopulated and undeveloped until the early 1900s, when the Great Central Railway began developing its Immingham Dock; as a consequence of the dock development, and of nearby post-Second World War large scale industrial developments Immingham developed from a minor place into a significant town during the 20th century. The Port of Immingham was the largest port in the United Kingdom by tonnage with 60 million tonnes of cargo passing through that year. Geography =Council ward= The Immingham Ward of North East Lincolnshire Council includes Stallingborough, Healing and Habrough. As of 2018, its elected councillors are Stewart Swinburn (Conservative), David Bolton (Labour), and David Watson (Labour). Population of the ward in 2001 was 11,804 persons (2001 census), and 11,507 persons in 2011 (2011 census). European route E22 passes through Immingham on the A180 and A160 via Immingham Dock. =Civil parish= The civil parish of Immingham is located on the south bank of the Humber Estuary west-north-west of Grimsby. The civil parish is bounded by South Killingholme to the north-west, with the drain watercourse outfalling at South Killingholme Haven forming the boundary ‚Äì also the county boundary between North Lincolnshire and North East Lincolnshire. The south- eastern boundary is with the civil parish of Stallingborough, with the North Beck Drain forming most of the boundary. The parish extends to the south-west as far as Roxton, with boundaries to the south-west and south with the civil parishes of Habrough and Keelby.Ordnance Survey 1:25000, Sheet 284, 2006 The civil parish is low lying, extending from below above sea level near the Humber foreshore, to a peak of in Roxton wood in the south-west corner. The main features within the parish are the Humber shoreline, running roughly north-west to south-east, the Immingham Dock and estate, and adjacent south of the dock the town of Immingham. The A180 and Stallingborough-Habrough section of the mainline railway west out of Grimsby (Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway) pass roughly east‚Äìwest through the southern part of the parish. The A1173 connects the town and dock to the A180. Excluding farms there are no other places of habitation outside the town in the civil parish. There are two abandoned sites of medieval villages in the parish: that of the village of Immingham, north-west of the modern town, near St Andrew's Church; and Roxton in the southern extremity of the parish. Population of the civil parish was 9,861 in 2001, and 9,642 in 2011. =Town= The town of Immingham is a compact urban area of approximately , situated south-west of the dock in the middle of the parish. It is bisected by the B1210. The town has a retail centre, \\"Kennedy Way\\", a swimming pool, and several schools. On the north- eastern outskirts of the town there is a Knauf UK GmbH plant that makes plasterboard. History =Etymology= The name Immingham is thought to mean the \\"Homestead of the people of Imma\\"; (de)constructed from the elements \\"Imma\\" + inga + ham. The place was referred to as Imungeham in the Domesday Book, and recorded as Immingeham in around 1115. The termination \\"-ham\\" is Anglo-Saxon in origin. The patronymic, (interpreted as \\"Imming\\" or \\"Emming\\") has been noted as occurring elsewhere, such as in Imminghausen (Immenhausen), or Emmingen (Emmingen-Liptingen) (Germany). =Early history= Immingham is mentioned (as Imungeham) as a manor in the 11th-century Domesday Book. St Andrew's Church Saint Andrew's church dates to the early medieval period, with much of the structure dating to the 13th century, with parts of the nave as early as the 11th or 12th century. The tower was constructed in the 16th/17th century, to a similar design to that found in nearby Aylesby, Wootton and Healing. The structure was restored in the 1880s and 1920. A decorated octagonal font in the church dates to the 15th C. The remains of a stone cross outside the church also dates to the medieval period. There is archaeological evidence of the medieval settlement. Earthwork remains indicating a settlement and agricultural use exist near south of the church; earthwork remnants of a former shrunken village exist to the north of the church. Archaeological evidence of saltmaking has been found north of the village (formerly in the parish of Harbrough, now within the dock estate), references to a saltmaking site here exist from the Domesday book, and in a late 12th-century document describing the gift of land including the saltpan to Newhouse Abbey. Pilgrim Fathers' memorial In 1608 the village briefly became a location in the story of the Pilgrim Fathers of America; their vessel was forced to put ashore due to bad weather, sailing up Killingholme Creek; the women of the party were allowed to sleep in the village church for the night, but news of this reached the authorities, with the consequence that the womenfolk were arrested, whilst the others escaped to the Netherlands. A popular protest secured the release of the women, who were then able to rejoin their families, and continue the journey. In the later medieval period Immingham decline, reduced from 66 households in 1523 to 46 in 1723, in common with other Lincolnshire places on or near the Humber banks. The silting of the haven leading from the Humber has been supposed as one possible cause. Churchfield Manor, in the north-west of the town dates to the late 1600s/early 1700s. Belmont cottage south of the church dates to the early 1800s. Both are now listed structures. The Ings at Immingham were enclosed in 1840. A coastguard station erected in 1850. The Great Grimsby and Sheffield Junction Railway (opened 1845) passed through the parish south of Immingham. In the 1870s the parish of Immingham had a population of 237, whilst Roxton was still known as a small hamlet. The parish had an area of which was mostly good grazing land ‚Äì much of which was owned by the Earl of Yarborough. In addition to the church the village also had Wesleyan and Primitive Methodist chapels. =1900‚Äì1950= \\"Tin house\\" Iron clad housing built 1907. (2009) Building of the Immingham Dock began in 1906, and it was opened by King George V on 22 July 1912. In part funded by the Great Central Railway, the dock property was ; covering , with of water. A railway line to the north-west, the Barton and Immingham Light Railway was opened in 1912. The docks were connected to their primary supply of labour in Grimsby by the Grimsby & Immingham Electric Railway, opened 1912. As part of the development of the new port some wood framed, corrugated iron clad housing was constructed; several of these survived to the 21st century, and one of these dated 1907 is now a listed structure. During the First World War, Immingham was a submarine base for British D class submarine. There was also an anti-aircraft battery in the town, manned with 1 pounder and later a 12-pounder gun. By the 1920s the village of Immingham had been eclipsed in importance by the port; a publication of the Cambridge University Press opined: By the early 1930s housing development was scattered across several locations: most was along Pelham Road, of which the majority was east of the original village (St Andrew's church), centred around the County Hotel, and close to the dock estate; further development had taken place south and south- east of the church, also on Pelham Road, in two locations each centred on one of the two nonconformist chapels. Almost all the housing was terraced, with the more generous ground plans found moving south-west along Pelham Road.Ordnance Survey 1:2500 1932 By the mid 1930s the village had grown as much to require a comprehensive school which opened in 1936. During the Second World War, John Dowland and Leonard Harrison received the George Cross for defusing a bomb that had fallen onto the grain ship SS Kildare in February 1940 in Immingham Dock. Anti-aircraft batteries were located around the dock during the war, as well as at Homestead Park, and near Immingham Grange. The Humber Force, part of the Home Fleet which had two cruisers and a destroyer flotilla, including HMS Afridi (F07) was based at Immingham during the war, as well as submarines including HMS Seal (N37). =1950‚Äìpresent= Kennedy Way Shopping Centre (2007) At the beginning of the 1950s the village of Immingham had little expanded.Ordnance Survey 1:10560. 1932, 1951, 1956 Development of new industries on the South Humber bank after the Second World War caused further growth of the town. By 1981 the population had risen to 11,506; making it North Lincolnshire's fourth town, after Grimsby, Cleethorpes and Scunthorpe. The expansion of the village included: Eastfield County Junior School built in 1970; expansion of the comprehensive school, 1973; a shopping centre \\"Kennedy Way\\" constructed in 1965-7; and north of the centre 18 blocks of five storey flats constructed by George Wimpey from 1965; a Civic Centre also opened in 1965. Standard housing also expanded: By 1968 there were many new side streets, in particular a new estate encompassed by Pilgrim Avenue; development along Pelham Road had become almost continuous, and the new village now expanding north-west towards the old Immingham.Ordnance Survey 1:10560. 1951, 1956, 1968 Further growth took place in the late 1960 and 1970s: north-west of Pelham Road, with the village continuous towards Church Lane; a new estate south-east of Pilgrim Road; as well as further infilling to the south-west.Ordnance Survey 1:10560/10000. 1968, 1972‚Äì4 Immingham Dock Station, originally part of the Barton and Immingham Light Railway closed in 1969, whilst Immingham Museum was established in 1970. In 1979 the Kennedy Way centre was extended to house a further supermarket and other shop units. The local council added a Sports centre in 1980. The expansion of the new town had peaked by the mid 1980s, with only minor extra expansion in the next two decades to 2006.Ordnance Survey. 1:10000, 1872‚Äì1985; 1:25000, 2006 In 2007 Immingham School was renamed Oasis Academy Immingham. Supermarket retailers Somerfield took over a former Kwik Save shop at Kennedy Way c.2006; the branch became part of the Co-op after the takeover of the chain in 2010; in 2014 the Co-op announced it was to close the shop (closed September 2014). Supermarket chain Aldi acquired the site in 2014 with the aim of opening a new store in 2015; the store was opened in May 2015 by the Mayor of Immingham. The town's Yorkshire Bank closed in August 2009 after 40 years of operation. the Norwich and Peterborough Building Society closed their Immingham office in March 2010; Barclays Bank closed their branch in the centre in late 2010. In 2012 planning permission was granted for a new large Tesco store to the north of Immingham Civic Centre, (originally consented 2009.), and refurbishment and alterations to the Kennedy Way shopping centre. Preparatory work on a ¬£10 million Tesco supermarket began 2014, with the Immingham Sports Centre to be demolished; a new sports facility was to be provided at Oasis Academy. A Poundstretcher opened in November 2014 at the development, and B & M store in December 2014. The new \\"Multi User Games Area\\" (MUGA) opened March 2015. In January 2015 Tesco announced cost-cutting plans following falling sales, and halted development of 49 stores, The built but unopened store in Immingham was mothballed, having had its opening previously delayed. As of late 2015 the unopened Tesco supermarket was being retained by Tesco. On 20 September 2018 Tesco opened one of their first Jack's stores in the unused building. In early 2016 work began on the reconstruction of Immingham Civic Centre ‚Äì an aim was to concentrate public services at one location including Immingham Town Council, North East Lincolnshire Council offices, Humberside Police offices, Shoreline (housing agent) offices, a Library and the Immingham museum, which portrays the role of the Great Central Railway in the building of the docks and construction of the local rail network. The museum, which is home to the Great Central Railway Society archive, is open from 1pm to 4pm, Wednesday to Saturday from March through to November. Roxton There was once a village at Roxton. The medieval village is evidenced by earthworks, as well a nearby cropmarking to the east. Additionally there may once have been a moated enclosure between Immingham and Roxton, now lost and not visible on modern maps.

It is administered by the prefecture-level city of Jining. Geography Liangshan County is situated north west of Jining in the south west of Shandong province. To the east it borders the prefecture-level cities of Tai'an, Heze to the west. To the north, the Yellow River separates Liangshan from Puyang, in Henan province. History The area was from prehistoric times surrounded by the largest marshland in north China, called the Daye Marsh and later the Liangshan Marsh. Because the area was largely a wasteland on the frontiers of several administrative units, government control was minimal, and bandit chiefs were active in the area. During the Song Dynasty Liang Shan (Mount Liang) became known as the \\"eight hundred li moorage of Mount Liang\\" and located at the extreme north of the Yellow River which passed through the area. When the Yellow River shifted course in 1289, the marshes of Liangshan shrunk considerably. During the Ming Dynasty it had been reduced to five smaller marshlands. Banditry continued on Mount Liang until the mid-seventeenth century, when the Qing Dynasty government established a military garrison. The city of Liangshan evolved from the garrison. After the Yellow River shifted back to its northern course in 1853, the marshes were gradually filled in by sediments carried downstream by the river and human land reclamation. Today the relatively small Dongping Lake() is what remains of the great marshes. Tourism The famous mountain Mount Liang (Li√°ng ShƒÅn) rises to 197.9 m above sea level is located within Liangshan County administrative territory.

It was widely used by television stations worldwide during the black-and-white television broadcasting era. It features a drawing of a Native American wearing a headdress along with numerous graphic elements that test different display aspects.  As television broadcasting ritual  The Indian-head test pattern became familiar to the large baby boom TV audiences in America from 1947 onwards; it would often follow the formal television station sign-off after the United States national anthem. The Indian head was also used by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) in Canada in conjunction with its own monochrome test pattern, following the Canadian national anthem sign-off in the evening, and during its final years in the late-1970s and early-1980s it was shown before sign-on in the morning, after the showing of the SMPTE color bars. It was also used by Rhodesia Television (RTV) during British colonial times (varying between Northern and Southern Rhodesia) following the playing of \\"God Save the Queen\\" at closedown. This test pattern was later used by the Venezuelan TV channel Venevision, in conjunction with the RMA Resolution Chart 1941, in the mid and late 1970s before signing on with the Venezuelan national anthem. Telesistema Mexicano (now Televisa) stations also used this test pattern until the late-1960s immediately after playing the Mexican national anthem at sign-off. In Sweden the Indian head was used in test transmissions from the Royal Institute of Technology alongside the RMA Resolution Chart 1941, Telefunken T05 test card, as well as other experimental test cards from Televerket and Chalmers University of Technology from 1948 until November 1958 when it was replaced by the Sveriges Radio TV (now Sveriges Television) test card.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Radio-Head-of-Gothenburg-Nils- Dahlbeck-Vintage-photo-352373202991.jpg Saudi Broadcasting Authority in Saudi Arabia also formerly used a modified version of the Indian head test pattern, with the Emblem of Saudi Arabia replacing the Indian head drawing,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlGJ7EM5GpU from 1954 until 1982 when it was replaced with a heavily modified Philips PM5544 test card. The Indian head was also used in Brazil by Rede Tupi, both as a test pattern and as part of a television ident, from its launch in 1950 until it became the first Brazilian television network to adopt colour television in 1971‚Äì1972. The Indian-head pattern could variously be seen after sign-off but while the station was still transmitting; while transmitting prior to a typical 6a.m. formal sign-on; or even during the daylight morning hours on newer low budget stations, which typically began their broadcast day with midday local programming around 10 or 11a.m. \\"Every television station, prior to its actual broadcasting period, transmits a test pattern for the purpose of permitting set owners to adjust their receiver controls for optimum reception.\\" The article also states that television programming (in 1949) was only a few hours each evening. The Indian-head test pattern was built into the RCA \\"monoscope\\" tube, a 2F21, which acted as a complete replacement for the TV camera. During the late 1950s the test pattern gradually began to be seen less frequently, after fewer sign-offs, on fewer stations, and for shorter periods in the morning, since new and improved TV broadcast equipment required less adjusting. In later years the test pattern was transmitted for as little as a minute after studio sign-off while the transmitter engineer logged required Federal Communications Commission-US/Industry Canada transmitter readings before cutting power. By the end of the Indian-head TV era in the late-1970s/early-1980s, there was no nightly test pattern on stations where automatic logging and remote transmitter controls allowed shutdown of power immediately after the formal sign-off. After an immediate transmitter power off, in lieu of the Indian-head test pattern and its sine wave tone, a TV viewer heard a loud audio hiss like FM radio interstation noise and saw the video noise. Audio and video noise received on Indian-head era TV sets respectively indicated the absence of analog aural and visual broadcast carriers. Consumer TVs typically did not have a no-signal noise muting and blanking feature until the late analog TV period. When US broadcasters switched to color television, the SMPTE color bars largely superseded the black-and-white test pattern image although a few station owners employed colorized versions of the NBC/CBS \\"bullseye\\" test pattern, in some cases lasting until as recently as the early-1990s.  Generation  The RCA TK-1C monoscope camera that generated the test pattern The Indian-head test pattern was not generated by pointing a camera at a card, as many older test patterns were. Rather, it was generated directly as a monochrome video signal by means of a monoscope tube, a specialized video camera tube with the pattern built into the tube. An RCA TK-1 test pattern generator (monoscope) is a 19-inch rack-mounted chassis, which contains a monoscope tube housed inside an anti- magnetic steel shield and associated electronic circuits for driving it. The monoscope tube is constructed similarly to a small cathode ray tube (CRT), but instead of displaying an image, it scans a built-in image, producing a video signal. The tube has a perfectly proportioned copy of the test pattern master art inside, permanently deposited as a carbon image on an aluminum target plate or slide. This perfect copy allowed all of the television studio and production control room video monitors, and home television sets, to be identically adjusted for minimal distortions such as ovals instead of circles. When the monitor or TV set was correctly adjusted to show test pattern circles, the received picture's aspect ratio was exactly four units wide by three units high.  Use  Indian Head pattern with its elements labeled, describing the use of each element in aligning a black and white analog TV receiver. The graphic of the Indian and all of the patterns on the chart served specific purposes. With the chart many typical daily (sometimes hourly) adjustments on cameras, home, and studio monitors could be made. An experienced broadcast engineer could glance at the drawing of the Indian Chief and quickly know if everything was OK or if more careful adjustment was needed. Within the chart the tools necessary to adjust perspective, framing, linearity, frequency response, differential gain, contrast and white level (brightness) are all provided. The grid and circles were used for perspective, framing and linearity. The tapered lines (marked with 20, 25, 30, and 35) were used for resolution and frequency response. The thin lines marked from 575 to 325 on one side and 300 to 50 on the other side referred to lines of resolution. The gray bands emerging from the center off to the lower right and upper left were for differential gain, contrast, and white level. Only after the monitors were adjusted was an actual Indian-head test pattern used. A cardboard mounted lithograph of the test pattern was typically attached to a rolling vertical easel in each TV studio, to be videographed by each studio camera during test time. Then the cameras were adjusted to appear identical on picture monitors, by alternately switching between and comparing the monoscope image and the test card image. Such adjustments were made on a regular basis because television system electronics then used hot vacuum tubes, the operating characteristics of which drifted throughout each broadcast day. Test patterns were also broadcast to the public daily to allow regular adjustments by home television set owners and TV shop repair technicians. In this regard, various features in the pattern were included to facilitate focus and contrast settings, and the measurement of resolution. The circular \\"bullseyes\\" in the centre and the four corners permitted uniform deflection yoke and oscillator amplitude adjustments for centering, pincushioning, and image size. The test pattern was usually accompanied by a 1,000 or 400 hertz sine wave test tone, which demonstrated that the TV aural receiver was working. If the tone was pure-sounding rather than a buzz or rattle, then transmitted speech and music would not be distorted. 400 Hz is somewhat less annoying for technicians to hear for extended work periods.1,000 Hz is the standard 0dB (0 decibel) reference point for analog-NTSC TV aural system frequency response measurements, but for simple line-reference 0dB audio level setting, preference for hearing 400 Hz is common knowledge and experience among broadcast and audio technicians. \\"From the factory the frequency of the reference tone is configured to be 400 Hz. This is a nice alternative to the more typical 1 kHz, a frequency which can soon become very annoying to a listener‚Äôs ears. In most cases 400 Hz will be perfectly acceptable, and actually preferred.\\" - Model 742 Audio Mixer User Guide, Issue 2, May 2005 (PDF) ; p.10 - Studio Technologies, Inc.  As a cultural icon  An actual Indian-head test card, the pattern as printed on art-grade white cardboard, was only of secondary importance to television system adjustment, but many of them were saved as souvenirs, works of found object art, and inadvertent mandalas. By contrast, nearly all of the hard-to-open, steel-shielded, vacuum glass monoscope tubes were junked with their hidden Indian-head test pattern target plates still inside. The monoscope target plates were also small, a few inches in size, while the camera test cards were , appropriate for picture- framed wall display. The original art work for the Indian chief portrait was completed for RCA's research engineers by an artist named Brooks on August 23, 1938. The original portrait was done in pencil, charcoal, ink and zinc oxide. For about a year the Indian portrait was televised in the laboratory as the entire test pattern. It was later incorporated into the pattern of calibrated lines and shapes. The original portrait measures across as a circular image containing several identifiable shades of gray, and some detail in the feathers. There is also some Zone 8 texture in the white feathering and some Zone 2 texture in the black hair. The master art for both the portrait and the pattern design was discovered in a dumpster by a wrecking crew worker as the old RCA factory in Harrison, New Jersey was being demolished in 1970. The worker kept the art for over 30 years before selling it to television engineer and collector Chuck Pharis. The Indian-head test pattern became obsolete in the 1960s with the debut of color television; from that point onward, an alternate test card of color bars became the test card of choice. Since the 1990s, most television stations in the United States have broadcast continuously without regular sign-offs, instead running infomercials, networked overnight news shows, syndicated reruns, cartoons, or old movies; thus, the broadcast of test patterns has become mostly obsolete (though they are still used in post-production and broadcast facilities to check color and signal paths). Nevertheless, the Indian-head test pattern persists as a symbol of early television. A variant of the card appeared on theatrical release posters for \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic's 1989 film UHF. It was sold as a night-light from 1997 to 2005 by the Archie McPhee company,The Indian-head test pattern night light was included in a set of three novelty night lights with test pattern lamp shades: RCA TK-1 Indian head (1950s), SMPTE color bars (1960s), and an Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) TV-test slide image (\\"This is a test! This is only a test!\\") from the middle Cold War era.According to the customer service department of Archie McPhee company, Seattle, Washington, the set of three, as Item #10480, was sold from 1999-01-11 to 2005-06-17. Their representative said these lamp shades were created by the company, and not obtained from an outside source. (Source accessed by phone on 2007-11-07). reminiscent of the times when a fairly common late-night experience was to fall asleep while watching the late movie, only to awaken to the characteristic sine wave tone accompanying the Indian-head test pattern on a black-and-white TV screen. The test card also featured in the opening sequence of the early 1960s science fiction anthology The Outer Limits. Decades later, it was popularized as the loading screen for the Fallout series video games, and a part of the Electronic Frontier Foundation's website. Many U.S. television stations chose the image of the Indian-head card to be their final image broadcast when their analog signals signed off for the final time between February 17 and June 12, 2009, as part of the United States digital television transition.

It corresponds to the linear partial differential equation: : abla^2 f = -k^2 f where is the Laplace operator (or \\"Laplacian\\"), is the eigenvalue, and is the (eigen)function. When the equation is applied to waves, is known as the wave number. The Helmholtz equation has a variety of applications in physics, including the wave equation and the diffusion equation, and it has uses in other sciences. Motivation and uses The Helmholtz equation often arises in the study of physical problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs) in both space and time. The Helmholtz equation, which represents a time-independent form of the wave equation, results from applying the technique of separation of variables to reduce the complexity of the analysis. For example, consider the wave equation : \\\\left( abla^2-\\\\frac{1}{c^2}\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial t^2}\\\\right) u(\\\\mathbf{r},t)=0. Separation of variables begins by assuming that the wave function is in fact separable: :u(\\\\mathbf{r},t) =A (\\\\mathbf{r}) T(t). Substituting this form into the wave equation and then simplifying, we obtain the following equation: :\\\\frac{ abla^2 A}{A} = \\\\frac{1}{c^2 T} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2 T}{\\\\mathrm{d} t^2}. Notice that the expression on the left side depends only on , whereas the right expression depends only on . As a result, this equation is valid in the general case if and only if both sides of the equation are equal to a constant value. This argument is key in the technique of solving linear partial differential equations by separation of variables. From this observation, we obtain two equations, one for , the other for :\\\\frac{ abla^2 A}{A} = -k^2 :\\\\frac{1}{c^2 T} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2 T}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^2} = -k^2, where we have chosen, without loss of generality, the expression for the value of the constant. (It is equally valid to use any constant as the separation constant; is chosen only for convenience in the resulting solutions.) Rearranging the first equation, we obtain the Helmholtz equation: : abla^2 A + k^2 A = ( abla^2 + k^2) A = 0. Likewise, after making the substitution , where is the wave number, and is the angular frequency, the second equation becomes :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2 T}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^2} + \\\\omega^2T = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\\\mathrm{d}t^2} + \\\\omega^2 \\\\right) T = 0. We now have Helmholtz's equation for the spatial variable and a second-order ordinary differential equation in time. The solution in time will be a linear combination of sine and cosine functions, whose exact form is determined by initial conditions, while the form of the solution in space will depend on the boundary conditions. Alternatively, integral transforms, such as the Laplace or Fourier transform, are often used to transform a hyperbolic PDE into a form of the Helmholtz equation. Because of its relationship to the wave equation, the Helmholtz equation arises in problems in such areas of physics as the study of electromagnetic radiation, seismology, and acoustics. Solving the Helmholtz equation using separation of variables The solution to the spatial Helmholtz equation: : abla^2 A = -k^2 A can be obtained for simple geometries using separation of variables. =Vibrating membrane= The two- dimensional analogue of the vibrating string is the vibrating membrane, with the edges clamped to be motionless. The Helmholtz equation was solved for many basic shapes in the 19th century: the rectangular membrane by Sim√©on Denis Poisson in 1829, the equilateral triangle by Gabriel Lam√© in 1852, and the circular membrane by Alfred Clebsch in 1862. The elliptical drumhead was studied by √âmile Mathieu, leading to Mathieu's differential equation. If the edges of a shape are straight line segments, then a solution is integrable or knowable in closed-form only if it is expressible as a finite linear combination of plane waves that satisfy the boundary conditions (zero at the boundary, i.e., membrane clamped). If the domain is a circle of radius , then it is appropriate to introduce polar coordinates and . The Helmholtz equation takes the form :A_{rr} + \\\\frac{1}{r} A_r + \\\\frac{1}{r^2}A_{\\\\theta\\\\theta} + k^2 A = 0. We may impose the boundary condition that vanish if ; thus :A(a,\\\\theta) = 0. The method of separation of variables leads to trial solutions of the form :A(r,\\\\theta) = R(r)\\\\Theta(\\\\theta), where must be periodic of period . This leads to :\\\\Theta +n^2 \\\\Theta =0, : r^2 R + r R' + r^2 k^2 R - n^2 R=0. It follows from the periodicity condition that : \\\\Theta = \\\\alpha \\\\cos n\\\\theta + \\\\beta \\\\sin n\\\\theta, and that must be an integer. The radial component has the form : R(r) = \\\\gamma J_n(\\\\rho), \\\\, where the Bessel function satisfies Bessel's equation : \\\\rho^2 J_n + \\\\rho J_n' +(\\\\rho^2 - n^2)J_n =0, and . The radial function has infinitely many roots for each value of , denoted by .

The general solution then takes the form of a generalized Fourier series of terms involving products of and the sine (or cosine) of These solutions are the modes of vibration of a circular drumhead. =Three-dimensional solutions= In spherical coordinates, the solution is: : A (r, \\\\theta, \\\\varphi)= \\\\sum_{\\\\ell=0}^\\\\infty \\\\sum_{m=-\\\\ell}^\\\\ell \\\\left( a_{\\\\ell m} j_\\\\ell ( k r ) + b_{\\\\ell m} y_\\\\ell(kr) \\\\right) Y^m_\\\\ell (\\\\theta,\\\\varphi) . This solution arises from the spatial solution of the wave equation and diffusion equation. Here and are the spherical Bessel functions, and are the spherical harmonics (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1964). Note that these forms are general solutions, and require boundary conditions to be specified to be used in any specific case. For infinite exterior domains, a radiation condition may also be required (Sommerfeld, 1949). Writing function has asymptotics : A(r_0)=\\\\frac{e^{i k r_0}}{r_0} f\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{r}_0}{r_0},k,u_0\\\\right) + o\\\\left(\\\\frac 1 {r_0}\\\\right)\\\\text{ as } r_0\\\\to\\\\infty where function is called scattering amplitude and is the value of at each boundary point Paraxial approximation In the paraxial approximation of the Helmholtz equation, the complex amplitude is expressed as :A(\\\\mathbf{r}) = u(\\\\mathbf{r}) e^{ikz} where represents the complex-valued amplitude which modulates the sinusoidal plane wave represented by the exponential factor. Then under a suitable assumption, approximately solves : abla_{\\\\perp}^2 u + 2ik\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial z} = 0, where is the transverse part of the Laplacian. This equation has important applications in the science of optics, where it provides solutions that describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves (light) in the form of either paraboloidal waves or Gaussian beams. Most lasers emit beams that take this form. The assumption under which the paraxial approximation is valid is that the derivative of the amplitude function is a slowly varying function of : : \\\\bigg { \\\\partial^2 u \\\\over \\\\partial z^2 } \\\\bigg \\\\ll \\\\bigg { k {\\\\partial u \\\\over \\\\partial z} } \\\\bigg . This condition is equivalent to saying that the angle between the wave vector and the optical axis is small: The paraxial form of the Helmholtz equation is found by substituting the above-stated expression for the complex amplitude into the general form of the Helmholtz equation as follows: : abla^{2}(u\\\\left( x,y,z \\\\right) e^{ikz}) + k^2 u\\\\left( x,y,z \\\\right) e^{ikz} = 0. Expansion and cancellation yields the following: :\\\\left( \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial x^2} + \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial y^2} \\\\right) u(x,y,z) e^{ikz} + \\\\left( \\\\frac {\\\\partial^2}{\\\\partial z^2} u (x,y,z) \\\\right) e^{ikz} + 2 \\\\left( \\\\frac \\\\partial {\\\\partial z} u(x,y,z) \\\\right) ik{e^{ikz}}=0. Because of the paraxial inequality stated above, the term is neglected in comparison with the term. This yields the paraxial Helmholtz equation. Substituting then gives the paraxial equation for the original complex amplitude : : abla_{\\\\perp}^2 A + 2ik\\\\frac{\\\\partial A}{\\\\partial z} = 0. The Fresnel diffraction integral is an exact solution to the paraxial Helmholtz equation. There is even a subject named \\"Helmholtz optics\\" based on the equation, named in honour of Helmholtz.

Inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation The inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation is the equation : abla^2 A(x) + k^2 A(x) = -f(x) \\\\ \\\\text { in } \\\\mathbb R^n, where is a function with compact support, and This equation is very similar to the screened Poisson equation, and would be identical if the plus sign (in front of the term) is switched to a minus sign. In order to solve this equation uniquely, one needs to specify a boundary condition at infinity, which is typically the Sommerfeld radiation condition : \\\\lim_{r \\\\to \\\\infty} r^{\\\\frac{n-1}{2}} \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial r} - ik \\\\right) A(r \\\\hat {x}) = 0 uniformly in \\\\hat {x} with \\\\hat {x}=1, where the vertical bars denote the Euclidean norm. With this condition, the solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation is the convolution : A(x)=(G*f)(x)=\\\\int\\\\limits_{\\\\mathbb R^n}\\\\\\\\! G(x-y)f(y)\\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}y (notice this integral is actually over a finite region, since has compact support). Here, is the Green's function of this equation, that is, the solution to the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation with equaling the Dirac delta function, so satisfies : abla^2 G(x) + k^2 G(x) = -\\\\delta(x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb R^n. \\\\, The expression for the Green's function depends on the dimension of the space.

He became known as the \\"Butcher of Badajoz\\" (Carnicero de Badajoz) because he ordered thousands killed, including wounded men in the hospital. Early life The son of a doctor, he enrolled at a young age in the Toledo Infantry Academy, where Francisco Franco was a fellow cadet. The two men received their commissions concurrently and served together in Africa, where Yag√ºe was wounded on several occasions and received several decorations. Yag√ºe was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1932. He, along with Franco and General Eduardo L√≥pez Ochoa, helped suppress a workers uprising in Asturias using Moroccan Regulars and Legionnaires in 1934. He was a strong early supporter of the Falange Espa√±ola and a close personal friend of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera. Spanish Civil War When Niceto Alcal√°-Zamora was replaced as President of the Republic by the left-wing Manuel Aza√±a on 10 May 1936, a group of Spanish Army officers, including Yag√ºe, Emilio Mola, Franco, Gonzalo Queipo de Llano and Jos√© Sanjurjo, started plotting to overthrow the democratically elected Popular Front government. This led to a military uprising which precipitated the Spanish Civil War on 17 July 1936. Yag√ºe's forces revolted in Ceuta before crossing the Straits of Gibraltar to link up with Nationalist forces in Seville, led by Queipo de Llano. Yag√ºe advanced northward, first seizing M√©rida before attacking Badajoz with 3,000 troops on 14 August 1936. Bitter street fighting took place when the Nationalists advanced into the city. Yag√ºe's forces eventually gained control of Badajoz, with both sides suffering heavy casualties. Under Yag√ºe's direction hundreds of prisoners, military and civilians, were killed or executed in Badajoz, during the Badajoz massacre.

Whitaker about his reason for killing all those people (10% of the city's population) and he answered:John T. Whitaker (1943) \\"We cannot escape history\\". New York, Macmillan. Yag√ºe was then promoted to colonel and afterwards advanced on Madrid, capturing Trujillo, Navalmoral de la Mata and Talavera de la Reina, but was unable to take the capital. He took part in the Aragon Offensive and seized control of Belchite, Caspe and L√©rida. He also played a leading role in the Nationalist victory at the Battle of the Ebro. In May 1938, Yag√ºe was removed from his command and imprisoned for injudicious remarks he made in a speech at Burgos, critical of Franco. He was back at the front within weeks. It has been said that he was the only commander of Spanish forces that the Condor Legion respected.Antony Beevor, \\"The Spanish Civil War\\" Yag√ºe never showed panic even when the enemy was close by, and was able to adjust battle plans quickly in order to suit changing circumstances (they hated Mola for his cautious approach).

Not willing to become a member of the National Socialist organization of university teachers as required, he resigned from his university position in 1935 and worked privately at his parents' home in Kiel until 1948. During this time he did research on tilings. In 1955 Heesch began teaching at Leibniz University Hannover and worked on graph theory. In this period Heesch did pioneering work in developing methods for a computer-aided proof of the then unproved four color theorem. In particular, he was the first to investigate the notion of \\"discharging\\", which turned out to be a fundamental ingredient of the eventual computer-aided proof by Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken. Between 1967 and 1971, Heesch made several visits to the United States, where bigger and faster computers were available, working with Haken at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and with Karl Durre and Yoshio Shimamoto at Brookhaven National Laboratory. During the crucial phase of his project, the German national research fund DFG cancelled financial support.

In 1937, the 8 year old Berliner's family, who were Jewish,https://www.cs.cmu.edu/link/iconoclast moved to America to escape Nazi persecution, taking up residence in Washington, D.C. He learned chess at age 13, and \\"it quickly became his main preoccupation.\\" Berliner is mentioned in \\"How I Started To Write\\", an essay by Carlos Fuentes, where he is described as \\"an extremely brilliant boy\\", with \\"a brilliant mathematical mind\\". \\"I shall always remember his face, dark and trembling, his aquiline nose and deep-set, bright eyes with their great sadness, the sensitivity of his hands...\\"The Art of the Personal Essay, edited by Phillip Lopate, 1995, pp. 435‚Äì36 In 1949, he became a master, won the District of Columbia Championship (the first of five wins of that tournament) and the Southern States Championship, and tied for second place with Larry Evans at the New York State Championship. He also won the 1953 New York State Championship (the first win by a non-New Yorker), the 1956 Eastern States Open directed by Norman Tweed Whitaker in Washington, D.C., ahead of William Lombardy, Nicolas Rossolimo, Bobby Fischer (at age 13) and Arthur Feuerstein, and the 1957 Champion of Champions tournament.The chess games of Hans Berliner, and Berliner played for his country's Olympiad team at Helsinki 1952, drawing his only game on the second reserve board. Berliner played four times in the US Chess Championship. In 1954 at New York, he scored 6¬Ω/13 to tie 8‚Äì9th places; Arthur Bisguier won. The last three times Berliner played in the U.S. Championship, Fischer won the tournament. In 1957‚Äì58 at New York, Berliner had his best result, 5th place with 7/13. In 1960‚Äì61 at New York, he scored 4¬Ω/11, tying for 8th‚Äì10th place. Finally in 1962‚Äì63 at New York, he scored 5/11 for a tied 7th‚Äì8th place. Berliner was talented at all aspects of chess. As a teenager he gave a multi-board blindfold simultaneous exhibition at the Washington Chess Divan, winning all six games against top local players.Hearst, Eliot and Knott, John,, Blindfold Chess: History, Psychology, Techniques, Champions, World Records, and Important Games, McFarland & Co, 2009, p.112. Berliner returned to school in 1969 to get a PhD.Hoffman, Paul. \\"Archimedes' Revenge\\", 1988. p. 176. He graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 1974 under the supervision of Allen Newell. His thesis was titled: \\"Chess as Problem Solving: The Development of a Tactics Analyzer\\". He died on January 13, 2017 in Riviera Beach, Florida, fourteen days away from his 88th birthday.https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/16/business/hans-berliner- master-chess-player-and-programmer-dies-at-87.html?partner=IFTTT&_r=0 =Correspondence play= Berliner is remembered most for his feats in correspondence play, in which games, played by mail can take days, months or even years to complete. He won the 5th World Correspondence Chess Championship in 1965, beginning the final game on April 1, 1965 and finishing three years later.McClain, Dylan, Hans Berliner, 87, Master Chess Player and Programmer, New York Times, January 17, 2017, p.A15 He won with the extraordinary score of 14/16 (twelve wins, four draws), a margin of victory of three points, thrice that of any other winner in these championships. Berliner's game in which he played the Two Knights Defense to defeat Yakov Estrin in the 1965 World Correspondence Chess Championship is one of the most famous and important games in correspondence chess., and As of March 31, 2005, Berliner still had by far the highest International Correspondence Chess Federation (ICCF) rating of any player in the United States, at 2726, 84 points above the second- highest rated player. Berliner's 2726 rating places him third on the ICCF's world list, behind Joop van Oosterom (2741) and Ulf Andersson (2736). (accessed 2008-05-08) In his 1999 book The System, Berliner claimed that the move 1.d4 gives White a large, and possibly decisive, advantage. =Programming= Berliner began designing computer chess programs in the early 1960s while employed by IBM. He entered Carnegie Mellon University at the age of 40 to earn a Ph.D. in computer science. While there, he came up with idea for HiTech, a more advanced chess computer program. It performed well, but only until it ran into transitions, that is, points in the game when the balance between the players changed. This led Berliner to conclude that HiTech was weak in board evaluation. He decided that to explore the problem, he should write an evaluation function for another game: backgammon. The result was BKG 9.8, written in the late 1970s on a DEC PDP-10. Early versions of BKG played badly even against poor players, but Berliner noticed that its critical mistakes were always at transitions. He applied principles of fuzzy logic to smooth out the transition between phases, and by July 1979, BKG 9.8 was strong enough to play against the ruling world champion Luigi Villa. It won the match 7‚Äì1, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in any game. Berliner states that the victory was largely a matter of luck, as the computer received more favorable dice rolls.Berliner, Hans, et al. \\"Backgammon program beats world champ\\", ACM SIGART Bulletin, Issue 69. January 1980. pp. 6‚Äì9. He also developed the B* search algorithm for game tree searching. Some of Berliner's PhD students, such as Carl Ebeling and Murray Campbell, went on to become noted researchers in computer chess themselves. Campbell was part of the Deep Blue team that defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997. In his later years Berliner lived in Florida and worked to develop computer chess programs.

Teradyne's high- profile customers include Samsung, Qualcomm, Intel, Analog Devices, Texas Instruments and IBM. History Nick DeWolf, Teradyne co-founder, 1959 Teradyne was founded by Alex d'Arbeloff and Nick DeWolf, who were classmates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the late 1940s. The men founded Teradyne in 1960, and set up shop in rented space above Joe and Nemo's hotdog stand in downtown Boston. The name, Teradyne, was intended to represent a very forceful presence. 1,000,000,000,000 dynes = 10 meganewtons (2,248,089 pounds-force or 1,019,716 kilograms-force). d'Arbeloff and DeWolf knew that testing electronic components in high-volume production would reach a bottleneck, unless the tasks performed by technicians and laboratory instruments could be automated. Their business plan involved a new breed of \\"industrial-grade\\" electronic test equipment, known for its technical performance, reliability and economic payback. In 1961, d'Arbeloff and DeWolf sold their first product, a logic-controlled go/no-go diode tester, to Raytheon. In the 1980s, Teradyne expanded its sub-assembly test business by acquiring Zehntel, a leading manufacturer of in-circuit board test systems. In 1987, the company introduced the first analog VLSI test system, the A500, which led the market in testing integrated devices that provided the interface between analog and digital data. The 1990s brought more diversification. The company acquired Megatest Corporation, which expanded its Semiconductor Test group to include smaller and less expensive testers than had been currently available. Teradyne also became a market leader in high-end System-on-a-Chip (SoC) test with its Catalyst and Tiger test systems. In 2000, Teradyne Connection Systems acquired Herco Technologies and Synthane-Taylor, and a year later they acquired circuit-board test and inspection leader, GenRad, and merged it into the Assembly Test Division. GenRad's Diagnostic Solutions, which made test equipment for the automotive manufacturing and service industries, became a separate product group for Teradyne. In 2006, Teradyne sold its two Boston buildings and consolidated all of its Boston-area staff to its current site in North Reading, Massachusetts. Teradyne grew its semiconductor test business with the addition of Nextest and Eagle Test Systems in 2008, serving the flash memory test market and high-volume analog test market, respectively. That same year, Teradyne entered the disk-drive test market with the internally developed Neptune product, which serves the data-intensive internet and computing storage markets. In 2010, Teradyne celebrated its 50th anniversary. The following year, it acquired LitePoint Corporation, a leading provider of test instruments for use with wireless products, such as laptops PCs, tablets, home networking and cell phones. With the addition of LitePoint, Teradyne's product portfolio stretched from wafer test of semiconductor chips to system-level circuit boards to products ready for store shelves. Upon d'Arbeloff's retirement, George Chamillard assumed the post of President and CEO. He was replaced at his retirement by former CFO Mike Bradley. Bradley retired in January 2014, and was in turn replaced by Semiconductor Test Division president Mark Jagiela. Teradyne operates major facilities around the world, with headquarters in North Reading, Massachusetts.

Released in 1972 by Warner Bros. Records, Give It Up is an amalgamation of various genres, including folk, blues, R&B;, and soft rock. Seven of the ten tracks on the album are covers, and the tracks are either soft sentimental ballads or fast-paced folk rock pieces. Lyrically, Give It Up revolves around Raitt's femininity, relationships, and being comfortable with herself. Raitt recorded the album at Bearsville Studios with producer Michael Cuscuna. Give It Up was Raitt's first album to reach the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it peaked at number 138. The initial reception was positive, as critics liked the vocals and the musicianship throughout the album. Contemporary reviews are also positive, with some critics calling Give It Up a stand-out album within Raitt's discography. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked Give It Up at number 495 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Composition Give It Up was recorded in June 1972 at Bearsville Studios in New York, with producer Michael Cuscuna. It is an amalgamation of several music genres, including folk, blues, R&B;, and soft rock. The ten tracks on the album are a mix of soft sentimental ballads and fast-paced folk rock pieces. Some of the faster tracks are accompanied by brass instrumentation, which is played in the style of a New Orleans brass band. This sound is demonstrated on the opening track \\"Give It Up or Let Me Go\\". It begins with an acoustic guitar, but then transitions into an explosive sound of a brass band, reminiscent of Dixieland music. Give It Up features many guest musicians, most of which were from the area around Woodstock, New York. Among these are future politician John Hall, multi-instrumentalist Freebo, and blues singer Paul Butterfield. Overall, Give It Up has a smoother, more polished sound than its predecessor Bonnie Raitt. Raitt wrote three songs for the album. The other seven songs are covers of songs by musicians like Chris Smither, Jackson Browne, and Joel Zoss. Lyrically, Give It Up revolves around Raitt's femininity, relationships, and being comfortable with herself. According to biographer Mark Bego, Raitt sounds more confident while singing on this album when compared to her vocal performance on Bonnie Raitt. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote: \\"Raitt can be earthy and sexy, but she balances it with an inviting sensuality that makes the record glow\\". Raitt herself would later criticize the vocals, and said: \\"I sound like Mickey Mouse!\\" Release and reception Give It Up was released in September 1972 by Warner Bros. Records. It sold moderately well, and was Raitt's first album to reach the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, where it peaked at number 138. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1985, denoting shipments of 500,000 copies. The song \\"Too Long at the Fair\\" was released as a promotional single to radio stations, although it did not reach any music charts. Give It Up received positive reviews upon release. A critic for Billboard magazine wrote: \\"Bonnie Raitt is presented in her second album for the label and it should be a big one. Her unique vocal treatments and guitar style on 'Stayed [sic] Too Long at the Fair' and the title song should do a lot to sell the album.\\" Record World described Give It Up as \\"an exceptional effort. The choice of material, from the self-penned numbers to a stunning Jackson Browne tune, is excellent and the musicianship and production could hardly be better.\\" Rolling Stone critic Jon Landau also praised the album, writing that \\"the best thing about Bonnie Raitt is her singing, and the best thing about Give It Up is that she sings great from beginning to end; in doing so, she successfully handles a far greater range of styles and material than on her first album and has produced a more interesting and satisfying record in the process.\\" Landau highlighted the three original songs, and called \\"Love Has no Pride\\" the perfect summation of Raitt's musical abilities. Retrospective appraisals have also been positive. In The New Rolling Stone Record Guide, critic Bart Testa wrote: \\"Give It Up [comes] closest to perfecting her approach: she [mingles] her blues resources with a variety of contemporary and folk-oriented songs, coming up with classics in 'Been Too Long at the Fair' and Eric Kaz's 'Love Has No Pride'.\\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted how singers like Sheryl Crow and Shelby Lynne were likely inspired by Give It Up, and ultimately described it as \\"one of the great Southern California records.\\" In a review published for Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau commended Raitt's maturity and intelligence in both her style of play as well as her lyrics. Christgau later ranked Give It Up at number 31 on his decade-end list of the best albums of the 1970s. In 2012, Rolling Stone ranked Give It Up at number 495 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, calling it \\"gorgeous folksy blues\\".Wenner, Jann S., ed. (2012).

Together with Jul√≠√°n Besteiro, a member of the Cortes Generales and a socialist, in 1939 Casado conducted a coup d'√©tat against the government of Prime Minister Juan Negr√≠n, claiming Negr√≠n wanted a Communist takeover. Republican forces regained control of Madrid, and Casado's efforts to negotiate a peace with General Franco failed. He insisted on unconditional surrender, which occurred in 1939. Casado went into exile in Venezuela, not returning to Spain until 1961. Early life The son of a military man, Casado entered the Royal Cavalry Academy at Valladolid at age 15. He progressed as an officer, reaching the rank of major by 1936. At the time, he served as head of the military household of President Manuel Aza√±a, established under the Second Republic of Spain.Thomas, Hugh. The Spanish Civil War. Penguin Books. 2001.

The main reason is maintenance‚Äîartificial turf stands up to heavy use, such as in sports, and requires no irrigation or trimming.

The first generation turf systems (i.e., short-pile fibers without infill) of the 1960s have been largely replaced by the second generation and third generation turf systems. Second generation synthetic turf systems feature longer fibers and sand infills, and third generation systems, which are most widely used today, offer infills that are mixtures of sand and granules of recycled rubber, or \\"rubber crumb\\". History David Chaney, who moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, in 1960 and later served as Dean of the North Carolina State University College of Textiles, headed the team of Research Triangle Park researchers who created the first notable artificial turf. That accomplishment led Sports Illustrated to declare Chaney as the man \\"responsible for indoor major league baseball and millions of welcome mats.\\" Artificial turf was first installed in 1964 on a recreation area at the Moses Brown School in Providence, Rhode Island.Dave Brady, \\"It's All So Artificial: The Uncommon Ground\\", Petersen's 12th Pro Football Annual, 1972. Los Angeles: Petersen Publishing Co., 1972; pp. 62-65. The material came to public prominence in 1966, when AstroTurf was installed in the Astrodome in Houston, Texas. The state-of-the-art indoor stadium had attempted to use natural grass during its initial season in 1965, but this failed miserably and the field conditions were grossly inadequate during the second half of the season, with the dead grass painted green. Due to a limited supply of the new artificial grass, only the infield was installed before the Houston Astros' home opener in April 1966; the outfield was installed in early summer during an extended Astros road trip and first used after the All-Star Break in July. The use of AstroTurf and similar surfaces became widespread in the U.S. and Canada in the early 1970s, installed in both indoor and outdoor stadiums used for baseball and football. More than 11,000 artificial turf playing fields have been installed nationally. More than 1,200 were installed in the U.S. in 2013 alone, according to the industry group the Synthetic Turf Council. Maintaining a grass playing surface indoors, while technically possible, is prohibitively expensive. Teams who chose to play on artificial surfaces outdoors did so because of the reduced maintenance cost, especially in colder climates with urban multi-purpose \\"cookie cutter\\" stadiums such as Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium and Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium. Sports applications =Baseball= Tropicana Field is installed with an artificial turf field. An artificial-turf field at a high school in Oregon Artificial turf was first used in Major League Baseball in the Houston Astrodome in 1966, replacing the grass field used when the stadium opened a year earlier. Even though the grass was specifically bred for indoor use, the dome's semi-transparent Lucite ceiling panels, which had been painted white to cut down on glare that bothered the players, did not pass enough sunlight to support the grass. For most of the 1965 season, the Astros played on green-painted dirt and dead grass. The solution was to install a new type of artificial grass on the field, ChemGrass, which became known as AstroTurf. Because the supply of AstroTurf was still low, only a limited amount was available for the first home game. There was not enough for the entire outfield, but there was enough to cover the traditional grass portion of the infield. The outfield remained painted dirt until after the All-Star Break. The team was sent on an extended road trip before the break, and on July 19, 1966, the installation of the outfield portion of AstroTurf was completed. The Chicago White Sox became the first team to install artificial turf in an outdoor stadium, as they used it in the infield and adjacent foul territory at Comiskey Park from 1969 through 1975. Artificial turf was later installed in other new multi-purpose stadiums such as Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium, Philadelphia's Veterans Stadium, and Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium. Early AstroTurf baseball fields used the traditional all-dirt path, but in the early 1970s, teams began using the \\"base cutout\\" layout on the diamond, with the only dirt being on the pitcher's mound, batter's circle, and in a five-sided \\"sliding box\\" around each base. With this layout, a painted arc would indicate where the edge of the outfield grass would normally be, to assist fielders in positioning themselves properly. The last stadium in MLB to use this configuration was Rogers Centre in Toronto, when they switched to an all-dirt infield (but keeping the artificial turf) for the 2016 season. Queens, New York City. The biggest difference in play on artificial turf was that the ball bounced higher than on real grass and also traveled faster, causing infielders to play farther back than they would normally so that they would have sufficient time to react. The ball also had a truer bounce than on grass so that on long throws fielders could deliberately bounce the ball in front of the player they were throwing to, with the certainty that it would travel in a straight line and not be deflected to the right or left. However, the biggest impact on the game of \\"turf\\", as it came to be called, was on the bodies of the players. The artificial surface, which was generally placed over a concrete base, had much less give to it than a traditional dirt and grass field did, which caused more wear-and-tear on knees, ankles, feet, and the lower back, possibly even shortening the careers of those players who played a significant portion of their games on artificial surfaces. Players also complained that the turf was much hotter than grass, sometimes causing the metal spikes to burn their feet or plastic ones to melt. These factors eventually provoked a number of stadiums, such as the Kansas City Royals' Kauffman Stadium, to switch from artificial turf back to natural grass. In 2000, Tropicana Field became the first MLB field to use a third-generation artificial surface, FieldTurf. All other remaining artificial turf stadiums were either converted to third- generation surfaces or were replaced entirely by new natural grass stadiums. In a span of 13 years, between 1992 and 2005, the National League went from having half of its teams using artificial turf to all of them playing on natural grass. With the replacement of Minneapolis's Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome by Target Field in 2010, only two MLB stadiums used artificial turf from 2010 through 2018: Tropicana Field and Toronto's Rogers Centre. This number grew to three when the Arizona Diamondbacks switched Chase Field to artificial turf for the 2019 season; the stadium had grass from its opening in 1998 until 2018, but the difficulty of maintaining the grass in the stadium, which has a retractable roof and is located in a desert city, was cited as the reason for the switch. In 2020, Miami's Marlins Park also switched to artificial turf for similar reasons, while the Texas Ranger's new Globe Life Field was opened with an artificial surface, as it too is a retractable roof ballpark in a hot weather city. =American football= The first professional American football team to play on artificial turf was the Houston Oilers, then part of the American Football League, who moved into the Astrodome in 1968, which had installed AstroTurf two years prior. In 1969, the University of Pennsylvania's Franklin Field in Philadelphia, at the time also home field of the Philadelphia Eagles, switched from grass to AstroTurf, making it the first National Football League stadium to use artificial turf. In 2002, CenturyLink Field, originally planned to have a natural grass field, was instead surfaced with FieldTurf upon positive reaction from the Seattle Seahawks when they played on the surface at their temporary home of Husky Stadium during the 2000 and 2001 seasons. This would be the first of a leaguewide trend taking place over the next several seasons that would not only result in teams already using artificial surfaces for their fields switching to the new FieldTurf or other similar surfaces but would also see several teams playing on grass adopt a new surface. (The Indianapolis Colts' RCA Dome and the St. Louis Rams' Edward Jones Dome were the last two stadiums in the NFL to replace their first-generation AstroTurf surfaces for next-generation ones after the 2004 season). For example, after a three-year experiment with a natural surface, Giants Stadium went to FieldTurf for 2003, while M&T; Bank Stadium added its own artificial surface the same year (it has since been removed and replaced with a natural surface, which the stadium had before installing the turf). Later examples include Paul Brown Stadium, which went from grass to turf in 2004; Gillette Stadium, which made the switch in 2006; and NRG Stadium, which did so in 2015. Today, 13 NFL fields out of 30 are artificial. NFL players overwhelmingly prefer natural grass over synthetic surfaces, according to a league survey conducted in 2010. When asked, \\"Which surface do you think is more likely to shorten your career?\\", 90% responded artificial turf. =Canadian football= The first professional Canadian football stadium to use artificial turf was Empire Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, then home of the CFL's BC Lions, which installed 3M TartanTurf in 1970. Today, eight of the nine stadiums in the Canadian Football League currently use artificial turf, largely because of the harsh weather conditions in the latter-half of the season. The only one that does not is BMO Field in Toronto, which initially had an artificial pitch and has been shared by the CFL's Toronto Argonauts since 2016 (however, part of the endzones at that stadium are covered with artificial turf). The first stadium to use the next- generation surface was Ottawa's Frank Clair Stadium (now TD Place Stadium), which the Ottawa Renegades used when they began play in 2002. The last stadium to replace their first-generation artificial surface for a newer one was the Saskatchewan Roughriders' Taylor Field, which replaced it in 2007; Taylor Field was the only major professional sports venue in North America to use a second-generation artificial playing surface, OmniTurf, which was used from 1988 to 1999. =Field hockey= The introduction of synthetic surfaces has significantly changed the sport of field hockey. Since being introduced in the 1970s, competitions in western countries are now mostly played on artificial surfaces. This has increased the speed of the game considerably and changed the shape of hockey sticks to allow for different techniques, such as reverse stick trapping and hitting. Field hockey artificial turf differs from artificial turf for other sports, in that it does not try to reproduce a grass \\"feel\\", being made of shorter fibers. This shorter fiber structure allows the improvement in speed brought by earlier artificial turfs to be retained. This development in the game, however, is problematic for many local communities who often cannot afford to build two artificial fields: one for field hockey and one for other sports. The International Hockey Federation and manufacturers are driving research in order to produce new fields that will be suitable for a variety of sports. The use of artificial turf in conjunction with changes in the game's rules (e.g., the removal of offside, introduction of rolling substitutes and the self-pass, and to the interpretation of obstruction) have contributed significantly to change the nature of the game, greatly increasing the speed and intensity of play as well as placing far greater demands on the conditioning of the players. =Association football= Aspmyra, Norway: home of the football club FK Bod√∏/Glimt Some association football clubs in Europe installed synthetic surfaces in the 1980s, which were called \\"plastic pitches\\" (often derisively) in countries such as England. There, several professional club venues had adopted them; QPR's Loftus Road, Luton Town's Kenilworth Road, Oldham Athletic's Boundary Park and Preston's Deepdale. QPR had been the first team to install an artificial pitch at their stadium in 1981, but were the first to remove it when they did so in 1988. The last Football League team to have an artificial pitch in England was Preston North End, who removed their pitch in 1994 after eight years in use. Turf gained a bad reputation on both sides of the Atlantic with fans and especially with players. The first-generation artificial turf surfaces were carpet-like in their look and feel, and thusly, a far harder surface than grass and soon became known as an unforgiving playing surface that was prone to cause more injuries, and in particular, more serious joint injuries, than would comparatively be suffered on a grass surface. This turf was also regarded as aesthetically unappealing to many fans. > In 1981, London football club Queens Park Rangers dug up its grass pitch and > installed an artificial one. Others followed, and by the mid-1980s there > were four artificial surfaces in operation in the English league. They soon > became a national joke: the ball pinged round like it was made of rubber, > the players kept losing their footing, and anyone who fell over risked > carpet burns. Unsurprisingly, fans complained that the football was awful to > watch and, one by one, the clubs returned to natural grass. In the 1990s, many North American soccer clubs also removed their artificial surfaces and re-installed grass, while others moved to new stadiums with state-of-the-art grass surfaces that were designed to withstand cold temperatures where the climate demanded it. The use of artificial turf was later banned by FIFA, UEFA and by many domestic football associations, though, in recent years, both governing bodies have expressed resurrected interest in the use of artificial surfaces in competition, provided that they are FIFA Recommended. UEFA has now been heavily involved in programs to test artificial turf, with tests made in several grounds meeting with FIFA approval. A team of UEFA, FIFA and German company Polytan conducted tests in the Stadion Salzburg Wals-Siezenheim in Salzburg, Austria which had matches played on it in UEFA Euro 2008. It is the second FIFA 2 Star approved artificial turf in a European domestic top flight, after Dutch club Heracles Almelo received the FIFA certificate in August 2005.Salzburg turf approval. UEFA.com (12 January 2006) The tests were approved.Mark Chaplin (10 November 2004) Approval for artificial fields. UEFA.com FIFA originally launched its FIFA Quality Concept in February 2001. UEFA announced that starting from the 2005‚Äì06 season, approved artificial surfaces were to be permitted in their competitions. A full international fixture for the 2008 European Championships was played on 17 October 2007 between England and Russia on an artificial surface, which was installed to counteract adverse weather conditions, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. It was one of the first full international games to be played on such a surface approved by both FIFA and UEFA. However, UEFA ordered that the 2008 European Champions League final hosted in the same stadium in May 2008 must take place on grass, so a temporary natural grass field was installed just for the final. UEFA stressed that artificial turf should only be considered an option where climatic conditions necessitate. One Desso \\"hybrid grass\\" product incorporates both natural grass and artificial elements. In June 2009, following a match played at Estadio Ricardo Saprissa in Costa Rica, American national team manager Bob Bradley called on FIFA to \\"have some courage\\" and ban artificial surfaces. FIFA designated a star system for artificial turf fields that have undergone a series of tests that examine quality and performance based on a two star system. Recommended two-star fields may be used for FIFA Final Round Competitions as well as for UEFA Europa League and Champions League matches. There are currently 130 FIFA Recommended 2-Star installations in the world. In 2009, FIFA launched the Preferred Producer Initiative to improve the quality of artificial football turf at each stage of the life cycle (manufacturing, installation and maintenance). Currently, there are five manufacturers that were selected by FIFA: Act Global, Limonta, Desso, GreenFields, and Edel Grass. These firms have made quality guarantees directly to FIFA and have agreed to increased research and development. In 2010, Estadio Omnilife with an artificial turf opened in Guadalajara to be the new home of Chivas, one of the most popular teams in Mexico. The owner of Chivas, Jorge Vergara, defended the reasoning behind using artificial turf because the stadium was designed to be \\"environment friendly and as such, having grass would result [in] using too much water.\\" However, players harshly criticized the field, saying it caused many injuries as a result of the harder surface. When Johan Cruyff became the adviser of the team, he recommended the switch to natural grass, which the team did in 2012. In November 2011, it was reported that a number of English football clubs were interested in using artificial pitches again on economic grounds. As of January 2020, artificial pitches are not permitted in the Premier League or Football League but are permitted in the National League and lower divisions. Examples of English football clubs who currently use third-generation artificial pitches are Sutton United, whose FIFA 2-Star quality pitch was installed at Gander Green Lane in August 2015, Bromley and Harrogate Town. In 2018, Sutton United were close to achieving promotion to the Football League and the debate in England about artificial pitches resurfaced again. It was reported that, if Sutton won promotion, they would subsequently be demoted two leagues if they refused to replace their pitch with natural grass. With Harrogate Town's promotion to the Football League in 2020, the club will now have to install a natural grass pitch at Wetherby Road. Artificial pitches are permitted in all rounds of the FA Cup competition. The first stadium to use artificial turf in Brazil was Atl√©tico Paranaense's Arena da Baixada in 2016. In 2020, the administration of Allianz Parque, home of Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, started the implementation of the second artificial pitch in the country. 2015 Women's World Cup The Women's World Cup took place entirely on artificial surfaces, as the event was played in Canada, where almost all of the country's stadiums use artificial turf due to climate issues. This plan garnered criticism from players and fans, some believing the artificial surfaces make players more susceptible to injuries. Over fifty of the female athletes protested against the use of artificial turf on the basis of gender discrimination. However Australia winger Caitlin Foord said that after playing 90 minutes there was no difference to her post-match recovery ‚Äì a view shared by the rest of the squad. The squad spent much time preparing on the surface and had no problems with its use in Winnipeg. \\"We've been training on [artificial] turf pretty much all year so I think we're kind of used to it in that way ... I think grass or turf you can still pull up sore after a game so it's definitely about getting the recovery in and getting it right\\", Foord said. The 2012 Women's World Player of the Year, Abby Wambach, noted \\"The men would strike, playing on artificial turf.\\" The controversial issue of gender equality and an equal playing field for all has sparked debate in many countries around the world. A lawsuit was filed on 1 October 2014 in an Ontario tribunal court by a group of women's international soccer players against FIFA and the Canadian Soccer Association and specifically points out that in 1994 FIFA spent $2 million to plant natural grass over artificial turf in New Jersey and Detroit. Various celebrities showed their support for the women soccer players in defense of their lawsuit, including actor Tom Hanks, NBA player Kobe Bryant and U.S. men's soccer team keeper Tim Howard. Even with the possibility of boycotts, FIFA's head of women's competitions, Tatjana Haenni, made it clear that \\"we play on artificial turf and there's no Plan B.\\" =Rugby= Rugby also uses artificial surfaces at a professional level. Infill fields are used by English premiership rugby teams Saracens F.C. and Worcester Warriors, as well as Pro14 teams Cardiff Blues and Glasgow Warriors. Some fields, including Twickenham Stadium, have incorporated a hybrid field, with grass and synthetic fibers used on the surface. This allows for the field to be much more hard wearing, making it less susceptible to weather conditions and frequent use. =Tennis= Carpet has been used as a surface for indoor tennis courts for decades, though the first carpets used were more similar to home carpets than a synthetic grass. After the introduction of AstroTurf, it came to be used for tennis courts, both indoor and outdoor, though only a small minority of courts use the surface. Both infill and non-infill versions are used, and are typically considered medium-fast to fast surfaces under the International Tennis Federation's classification scheme. A distinct form found in tennis is an \\"artificial clay\\" surface, which seeks to simulate a clay court by using a very short pile carpet with an infill of the same loose aggregate used for clay courts that rises above the carpet fibers. Tennis courts such as Wimbledon are considering using an artificial hybrid grass to replace their natural lawn courts. Such systems incorporate synthetic fibers into natural grass to create a more durable surface on which to play. Such hybrid surfaces are currently used for some association football stadiums, including Wembley Stadium. =Golf= Synthetic turf can also be used in the golf industry, such as on driving ranges, putting greens and even in some circumstances tee boxes. Because of the vast areas of golf courses and the damage from clubs during shots, it is not feasible to surface fairways with artificial turf. Other applications =Landscaping= A home's yard with artificial grass. Since the early 1990s, the use of synthetic grass in the more arid western states of the United States has moved beyond athletic fields to residential and commercial landscaping. New water saving programs, as of 2019, which grant rebates for turf removal, do not accept artificial turf as replacement and require a minimum of plants. The use of artificial grass for convenience, sometimes faces opposition: Legislation frequently seeks to preserve natural gardens and fully water permeable surfaces, therefore restricting the use of hardscape and plantless areas, including artificial turf. In several locations in different countries, homeowners have been fined or forced to remove artificial turf, or had to defend themselves in courts. Many of these restrictions can be found in local bylaws and ordinances, and are not always applied in a consistent manner. =Airports= Artificial turf has been used at airports. Here it provides several advantages over natural turf ‚Äì it does not support wildlife, it has high visual contrast with runways in all seasons, it reduces foreign object damage (FOD) since the surface has no rocks or clumps, and it drains well. Some artificial turf systems allow for the integration of fiber-optic fibers into the turf. This would allow for runway lighting to be embedded in artificial landing surfaces for aircraft (or lighting or advertisements to be directly embedded in a playing surface). Environmental concerns Both the rubber granules (often made from recycled waste tires) and the synthetic fibers of artificial turf are subject to wear and can be washed into the environment. Second only to tire and road wear particles (TRWP) that make up a large portion of the fine road debris, the rubber granulate from artificial turf infill constitutes a significant source of rubber pollution. Fragments from the artificial reeds make their way into the environment as microplastics pollution in both marine as well as soil environments. Health and safety =Chemical safety= The rubber crumb that makes up the infill of most artificial turf is derived from old tires. These crumbs are known to contain heavy metals, some cancer causing compounds, and many chemicals whose effects are unknown. What is not clear is how much gets ingested, by what route - abrasions, swallowing crumbs, or inhalation - and the health effect of this exposure. An epidemiological study was started in 2016 and is ongoing. While this data is being gathered, different groups have tried to estimate exposure and its effects. Although most of the debate has centered on whether these exposures cause cancer, there is growing evidence that exposure to these endocrine disrupting chemicals can affect early puberty, obesity, and children's attention spans Different experts have come to different conclusions. Some say we should take no chances and crumb infill should not be used: \\"Caution would argue against use of these materials where human exposure is likely, and this is especially true for playgrounds and athletic playing fields where young people may be affected.‚Äù Others believe that since the overall cancer risk for adolescents is low, but the health problems from inactivity are high, that the health benefits of the additional sports that can be played on artificial fields outweighs the possible cancer risk. \\"Regular physical activity during adolescence and early adulthood helps prevent cancer later in life. Restricting the use or availability of all-weather year-round synthetic fields and thereby potentially reducing exercise could, in the long run, actually increase cancer incidence, as well as cardiovascular disease and other chronic illnesses.\\" =Injuries= A number of health and safety concerns have been raised about artificial turf. Friction between skin and older generations of artificial turf can cause abrasions and/or burns to a much greater extent than natural grass. Artificial turf tends to retain heat from the sun and can be much hotter than natural grass with prolonged exposure to the sun. There is some evidence that periodic disinfection of artificial turf is required as pathogens are not broken down by natural processes in the same manner as natural grass. Despite this, a 2006 study suggests certain microbial life is less active in artificial turf. There is evidence showing higher rates of player injury on artificial turf. By November 1971, the injury toll on first- generation artificial turf had reached a threshold that resulted in congressional hearings by the House subcommittee on commerce and finance. In a study performed by the National Football League Injury and Safety Panel, published in the October 2012 issue of the American Journal of Sports Medicine, Elliott B. Hershman et al. reviewed injury data from NFL games played between 2000 and 2009. \\"...the injury rate of knee sprains as a whole was 22% higher on FieldTurf than on natural grass. While MCL sprains did not occur at a rate significantly higher than on grass, rates of ACL sprains were 67% higher on FieldTurf.\\" Metatarsophalangeal joint sprain, known as \\"turf toe\\" when the big toe is involved, is named from the injury being associated with playing sports on rigid surfaces such as artificial turf and is a fairly common injury among professional American football players. Artificial turf is a harder surface than grass and does not have much \\"give\\" when forces are placed on it. =Materials used= Some artificial turf uses infill such as silicon sand and/or granulated rubber, referred to as \\"crumb rubber\\". Some granulated rubber is made from recycled car tires and may carry heavy metals which can leach into the water table. As early as 2007, a moratorium on the use of ground-up rubber tires in fields and playgrounds was recommended based on health concerns. As of 2013, the EPA called for further studies to monitor the impact of particulate matter from fields and playgrounds that use artificial turf. PFAS chemicals have also been found in turf samples, possibly a residual from the extrusion process.

After the successful defense of the America's Cup in Auckland in 2000 the then skipper, Russell Coutts, tactician Butterworth and several other members of the New Zealand team moved to the Alinghi team. They then won the America's Cup in 2003, beating Team New Zealand 5‚Äì0 in waters near Auckland. He was inducted into the America's Cup Hall of Fame in 2004.

According to him, winning the America's Cup is akin to climbing the K2 mountain: something that only the top sportsmen in their field can achieve. He says: \\"Great sportsmen seek victory on the field of play, or in our sport; on the high seas. A sportsman seeking to win through the courts or through what Dennis called the 'backdoor' only demeans themselves as sportsmen and taints any victory, as well as the sport.

A member of the School of Advanced Study, its focus is the study of cultural history and the role of images in culture ‚Äì cross-disciplinary and global. It is concerned with the histories of art and science, and their relationship with superstition, magic, and popular beliefs. The researches of the Warburg Institute are historical, philological and anthropological. It is dedicated to the study of the survival and transmission of cultural forms ‚Äì whether in literature, art, music or science ‚Äì across borders and from the earliest times to the present including especially the study of the influence of classical antiquity on all aspects of European civilization. Based originally in Hamburg, Germany, in 1933 the collection was moved to London, where it became incorporated into the University of London in 1944. History =Hamburg= The institute was formed in Hamburg, Germany, from the library of Aby Warburg (1866‚Äì1929), a student of Renaissance art and culture, and a scion of the wealthy Jewish Warburg family. As an art historian, Warburg had become dissatisfied with an aestheticising approach to art history and was interested in a more philosophical and interdisciplinary approach. While studying the culture of Renaissance Florence, he grew interested in the influence of antiquity on modern culture, and the study of this second life of the Classical World became his life work. In 1900 he decided to establish the Warburg-Bibliothek f√ºr Kulturwissenschaft,\\"Aby M. Warburg\\" at the Aby-Warburg-Stiftung website (in German). Retrieved 3 March 2015. but, although he had begun collecting books in 1886, he didn't actually establish his library until 1909.Deborah J.

They discussed the possibility of converting the library into a research institute in 1914, but World War I and illness interfered. After Warburg returned to Hamburg in 1924, he and Saxl initiated the process of conversion, and the Warburg-Bibliothek officially opened its doors as a research institute in 1926. Eventually, the privately funded library, built around the interdisciplinary approach, became enormous. Warburg \\"famously forfeited his right to a share of his fortune on condition that his younger brother Max would buy him any books he required\\". The institute was later affiliated to the University of Hamburg. Neo-Kantian Philosopher and professor at the newly founded University Ernst Cassirer used it, and his students Erwin Panofsky and Edgar Wind worked there. The original Warburg Library building in Hamburg is now a research institute, Warburg-Haus Hamburg. =London= The Warburg as seen from Woburn Square In 1933, under the shadow of Nazism, the institute was relocated to London, where, with the aid of Lord Lee of Fareham, Samuel Courtauld, and the Warburg family, it was installed in Thames House in 1934. The institute moved to the Imperial Institute Buildings in 1937. In 1944 it became associated with the University of London. Henri Frankfort succeeded Saxl as director in 1949, and in 1955 was succeeded by Gertrud Bing, who had joined the organization in 1922. During her term as director, the institute moved to its current home at the university in 1958. Bing was succeeded by Ernst Gombrich in 1959. From 1976 to 1990, J. B. Trapp was director, and from 1991 to 2001, Nicholas Mann. In 1994 the Warburg became a founding institute of the University of London's School of Advanced Study. Recent directors have been Charles Hope (2001 to 2010), Peter Mack (2010 to 2014), originally at The Warburg Institute website. and David Freedberg (from July 2015 to April 2017).Distinguished international scholar David Freedberg appointed Director of The Warburg Institute In 2011, legal action was started by the University of London together with the institute's advisory council about their disagreement regarding the meaning of the 1944 deed of trust that granted the university the collection; the pledge \\"to maintain and preserve the collection 'in perpetuity' as 'an independent unit'\\" is problematised by the institute's annual deficit, estimated at half a million pounds. Several students and scholars who had used the Warburg resources or studied there protested this planned merge. A petition on Change.org to save the Warburg's independence was started by Brooke Palmieri, a student of University College London after working on her PhD thesis at the Warburg. In only two months, the petition had almost twenty five thousand signatures. In recent years the university has charged a proportion of its total estate expenditure to the Warburg Institute; as a result, the finances of the once solvent Institute have been strongly affected. In November 2014, a High Court judgment established that the university's conduct in this regard was not lawful., originally at The Warburg Institute website. Building Entrance to the Warburg Institute in Woburn Square The institute occupies a large building on Woburn Square, in the University of London's Bloomsbury campus in the central London Borough of Camden. Designed by Charles Holden and built in 1957, the building is adjacent to the University of London Student Union, Birkbeck College, School of Oriental and African Studies, and Christ the King Church. It is also the home of the studio of the Slade School of Fine Art, University College, London. The Warburg Institute maintains a research library of more than 350,000 volumes. These volumes, except for a small number of rare and valuable books, are kept on open shelves and are accessible to all. The library is notable for its unusual and unique reference system: the books are arranged by subject according to Warburg's division of human history into the categories of Action, Orientation, Word, and Image. The institute also holds a large photographic collection of 450,000 photographs of paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings, arranged according to an iconographic system initiated by Rudolf Wittkower and Edgar Wind.K. Mazzucco, 'L'iconoteca Warburg di Amburgo: Documenti per una storia della Photographic Collection del Warburg Institute', Quaderni storici, 141, xlvii n. 3, 2012 The photographic collection also holds the valuable archive of the Image of the Black in Western Art. The Institute's archive contains the personal and working papers of Aby Warburg, together with the archives of Henri Frankfort, Ernst Gombrich and other Warburgian scholars. Organisation In addition to its primary purpose as an academic reference library, the institute accepts a small number of graduate students each year. The institute awards the degrees of Master of Arts in Cultural and Intellectual History (1300‚Äì1650) and Master of Arts in Art History, Curatorship and Renaissance culture, Master of Philosophy and Doctor of Philosophy; the first and the second are one-year degrees with taught and research components, the MPhil is a two-year research degree which would usually be expected to lead onto a PhD with further study, and the last is a three-year research degree. The emphasis of these programs is on developing interpretative skills in a number of different academic subjects, which follows from the institute's interdisciplinary mission. Considerable attention is devoted to improving language skills and knowledge of primary sources. Students and faculty Scholars associated with the Warburg Institute include Ernst Cassirer, Rudolf Wittkower, Otto Kurz, Henri Frankfort, Arnaldo Momigliano, Ernst Gombrich, Erwin Panofsky, Edgar Wind, Frances Yates, Enriqueta Harris, D. P. Walker, Michael Baxandall, Jennifer Montagu, Anthony Grafton, and Elizabeth McGrath. The current group of scholars continues the institute's tradition of interdisciplinary research into history, philosophy, religion, and art. The permanent staff includes a number of academics and graduate students who hold short and long-term fellowships.

ACSH's publications focus on advocacy related to food, nutrition, health, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, biology, biotechnology, infectious disease, and the environment. History The American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) was founded in 1978 by Elizabeth Whelan. In the 1970s, ACSH scientists, saying they were concerned with what they described as the lack of sound scientific basis, common sense, reason, and balance in public forums and public policy regarding such issues as health and the environment, began to produce their own policy statements. In 1981, ACSH decided to start taking some corporate funding, but not for specific projects or programs, only for general support. Over the years, their articles have included such topics as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), obesity, chemophobia, phthalates, DDT, fracking, e-cigarettes, GMOs, atrazine, and bisphenol A. Whelan says she was motivated to found the American Council on Science and Health after doing research for the pharmaceutical company Pfizer about a section of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 to ban certain chemicals from foods. With further research, she says she found that public discourse and public policy were chemophobic. Her first book, Panic in the Pantry (1976), challenged the notion, popular in the 1970s, that \\"natural\\" was better and that \\"chemicals\\" were dangerous. In 1978, along with Frederick J. Stare, founder of the Harvard Nutrition Department, Whelan invited 50 other scientists to \\"bring the message of sound science to consumers, via the media\\" in a \\"consumer education consortium\\". Their first financial support came from the Scaife Foundation and the John M. Olin Foundation. By 2003, almost 400 scientists had joined ACSH. In September 2014, Whelan died. She was replaced by science writer Hank Campbell in July 2015. Thom Golab became president in August 2019. Issue advocacy =Chemicals in the environment= ACSH frequently advocates against \\"regulating chemicals without scientific proof of harm.\\" A 2009 editorial by board member Henry Miller in Investor's Business Daily criticized the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s employment of the precautionary principle to regulate chemicals such as bisphenol-A, phthalates, flame retardants, the herbicide atrazine and fluorinated chemicals used to make Teflon, all of which he described as \\"important\\" and \\"demonstrably safe.\\" In February 2009, the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act imposed regulations of several substances and banned the manufacture for sale, distribution in commerce, or import any children's toy or childcare article that contains concentrations of more than 0.1 percent of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), or benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP). Michael Kamrin, who was on ACSH's Board of Scientific and Policy Advisors, published a critical review in 2009 in the Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, saying that phthalates were \\"safe.\\" ACSH's advocacy on the issue extends back to 1999, when it worked with former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop to advocate for the ingredient used in many soft plastics.\\"Battle over phthalates heats up\\". CNN. September 28, 1999. =Food safety and nutrition= ACSH has advocated against taxation of foods known to contribute to weight gain as a means to combat obesity.\\"NYC Food Cops' National Agenda\\" . New York Post. September 8, 2008. The group opposed New York State's move to require food chains to post calorie information on their products.\\"Doc Frieden's Food Voodoo\\" . New York Post. January 23, 2008. ACSH has also called for better regulation and testing of dietary supplements.\\"Dietary Supplements: A Source of Regulatory Confusion (from Pharmacology Matters)\\" . Pharmacology Matters. April 13, 2009. In a 2009 interview by The Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee, an ACSH spokesperson criticized the Obama's family's White House Vegetable Garden, calling the Obamas \\"organic limousine liberals\\" and claiming without evidence that their promotion of organic food was a \\"public health concern\\" since not everyone could afford it and also claimed that organic farming would \\"lead to famine\\" and said Michelle Obama \\"should use pesticides in the garden.\\" =Diseases and pharmaceuticals= ACSH criticized Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Breast Cancer Education and Awareness Requires Learning Young Act as focusing on detection methods that were \\"not scientifically supported but distracting from more effective measures.\\" The group worked to \\"clarify\\" \\"unclear\\" messages and dispel \\"myths\\" surrounding the swine flu outbreak in 2009. In 2008, ACSH applauded the American Academy of Pediatrics for demanding for an episode of Eli Stone to carry a disclaimer since the show depicted a jury awarding damages based on the claim that a vaccine caused autism. ACSH has long been critical of groups that claim a link between the two. Following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001, ACSH opposed the appointment of a federal official to oversee and administer aid to those injured during the attacks and subsequent rescue; it argued that such a move would \\"create another layer of bureaucracy between victims and aid.\\"\\"WTC Health Czar? No!\\". New York Post. January 30, 2006. Also, the group criticized rescue workers who attempted to \\"fraudulently receive financial compensation but did not suffer injuries.\\"\\"Exploiting 9/11\\" . New York Post. June 26, 2008. =Tobacco= In 2008, then associate director Jeff Stier addressed the negative long-term effects of smoking by using the example of Barack Obama during his 2008 campaign.\\"Will smoking past affect Obama‚Äôs health?\\". Politico. May 28, 2008. It opposed a New York State law that outlawed certain types of smokeless tobacco because, it argued, that would make it \\"harder for adult smokers to quit cigarettes.\\"\\"Council Votes to Boost Butts\\". New York Post. October 16, 2009. ACSH also criticized Apple Inc. workers who refused to enter homes where smoking had taken place to make technical repairs out of concern over second- hand smoke.\\"Latest Excuse Not to Work\\". Fox Business. November 24, 2009. Unlike some public health organizations, ACSH does not support government efforts to ban the sale of e-cigarettes.A Tool to Quit Smoking Has Some Unlikely Critics. New York Times. November 7, 2011. In 1980, ACSH co-founder Frederick J. Stare was chairman of ACSH's Board of Directors and sought funding from US tobacco giant Philip Morris USA for ACSH's activities. He stated that he believed financially supporting ACSH would be to Phillip Morris' benefit.Fred Stare, American Council on Science and Health Untitled letter to Helmut Wakeham of PM Letter. December 5, 1980. Bates No. 1000283163/3165 Funding The Scaife Foundation and John M. Olin Foundation provided ACSH's first financial support in the 1970s. In her address on the 25th Anniversary of ACSH, Whelan noted that their critics such as Phil Donahue and Barbara Walters accused them of being a \\"surrogate\\" of the petrochemical industry and a \\"shill\\" for the food industry. To appease their critics, ACSH only accepted funding from private foundations for two years. However, as the media continued to indicate that ACSH was industry-supported, the Board decided on a fundraising policy through which \\"about 40% of ACSH [funding] comes from private foundations, about 40% from corporations, and the rest of the sale of ACSH publications\\". As of 2005, they had received $90,000 from ExxonMobil. Whelan told John Tierney of The New York Times in 2007 that \\"ACSH has a diverse funding base - we receive donations from private foundations and individuals and unrestricted (usually very small) grants from corporations. The fastest-growing segment of our funding base is individual consumers who are sick and tired of the almost daily baseless scares - and they write us checks to help support our work.\\"\\"Money, Fats and Science\\". The New York Times. November 5, 2007. In 2010, Whelan told The New Yorker that about a third of the organization's $2 million annual budget came from industry. In 2013, leaked internal financial documents revealed that 58% of the ACSH's donations in the period from July 1, 2012, to December 20, 2012, came from corporations and large private foundations, many of which themselves had ties to industries. Donors included Chevron, Coca-Cola, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Bayer Cropscience, Procter & Gamble, Syngenta, 3M, McDonald's and Altria. In addition, the documents revealed that the organization had on numerous occasions directly solicited donations from industry sources on the basis of projected reports on the specific issues in which those companies and industry organizations had such a stake.  Industry influence  ACSH is well known for being a pro-industry group,Eggen D. (2010) \\"How interest groups behind health-care legislation are financed is often unclear\\". The Washington Post. and the organization's critics have accused it of being biased in favor of industry. In response to such accusations, ACSH claims that \\"evidence-based science and medicine, sensible health advice, technological progress, and consumer freedom need protection from the nonstop assault of unscientific activist groups\\". In 1979, the information director of the FDA said, \\"Whelan just makes blanket endorsements of food additives. Her organization is a sham, an industry front.\\" In 1980, ACSH co-founder Frederick J. Stare was chairman of ACSH's Board of Directors and sought funding from US tobacco company Philip Morris USA for ACSH's activities, stating that he believed financially supporting ACSH would be to Phillip Morris' benefit. In the early 1990s, ACSH decided to stop reporting its funding. Their 1991 report shows that many corporations contributed funds.Center for Science in the Public Interest. In 1982, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), a consumer advocacy group, published a report on ACSH's practices that stated, \\"ACSH seems to arrive at conclusions before conducting studies. Through voodoo or alchemy, bodies of scientific knowledge are transmogrified into industry-oriented position statements.\\"Harnik, Peter. \\"Voodoo Science, Twisted Consumerism: the Golden Assurances of the American Council on Science and Health\\". Center for Science in the Public Interest. January 1982. CSPI director Michael F. Jacobson said of ACSH, \\"This organization promotes confusion among consumers about what is safe and what isn't.... ACSH is using a slick scientific veneer to obscure and deny truths that virtually everyone else agrees with.\\"Center for Science in the Public Interest. \\"'Consumer Group' labeled front for industry\\". News Release. February 14, 1982. In a 1992 internal memo by Whelan disclosed by Consumer Reports, Whelan directed her staff to ask McNeil Specialty for $10,000 toward sweetener paper and disclosed that her staff would seek \\"more CCC [Calorie Control Council] money... to help us get new sweetener booklet out\\". McNeil Specialty Products (now McNeil Nutritionals) owns the US marketing rights to Splenda, the branded name of the artificial sweetener sucralose; the Calorie Control Council is an industry trade association for producers of artificial sweeteners, fat substitutes, and low-calorie foods. The same memo instructs that staffers give \\"special attention\\" to \\"Mr. McDermott at Searle about meat money\\". One notable critic was Ralph Nader who stated that \\"ACSH is a consumer front organization for its business backers. It has seized the language and style of the existing consumer organizations, but its real purpose, you might say, is to glove the hand that feeds it.\\" Environmental scientist Haydn Washington and cognitive scientist John Cook have described ACSH in Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand as a greenscamming organization, i.e. as one of many groups that are formed to \\"masquerade as groups concerned about the environment, but actually work against the interests implied in their names\\".Washington, Haydn; Cook, John (2011). Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand. Routledge 2011, p. 72‚Äì73. In 2017, 26 health, environmental, labor and public interest groups sent a letter to USA Today, asking them to \\"refrain from publishing further columns authored by members of the American Council on Science and Health, or at the very least require that the individuals identify the organization accurately as a corporate-funded advocacy group\\". Gilbert Ross controversy Gilbert Ross, ACSH's former medical director, served time in federal prison and had his medical license revoked for Medicaid fraud before being hired by ACSH. When news of Ross's misconduct was made public in 2005, ACSH responded by stating on its website that Ross was remorseful for the role he played in the scam, it had occurred during a period of personal and financial hardship, and he had resigned from the fraudulent clinic after seven weeks of employment. His medical license was reinstated in 2001. ACSH identifies Ross as an emeritus advisor.

Seventeen years after Leicester's death she claimed in litigation that she had secretly been his wife, even though she had herself remarried while Leicester was still alive. Family and first marriage Douglas Howard was the eldest daughter of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham, by his second wife, Margaret Gamage. Douglas Howard was probably named in honour of her godmother Margaret Douglas, Countess of Lennox. One of her brothers was Lord Admiral Charles Howard of Effingham. Douglas Howard was at court by about 1559, probably as a maid of honour.Rickman 2008 p. 49 In 1560 she married a rich peer, John Sheffield, 2nd Baron Sheffield. They had a son and a daughter: Edmund Sheffield, 1st Earl of Mulgrave, who was born in 1565, and Elizabeth Sheffield, who later married Thomas Butler, 10th Earl of Ormonde, and died in November 1600.  Love affair  Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, lover of Douglas Sheffield Not long after the death of John, Lord Sheffield, in December 1568, his widow began an affair with Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, Queen Elizabeth's favourite,Rickman 2008 p. 51 At some point in the following years, Leicester wrote her a remarkable letter,Read 1936 pp. 15‚Äì16; Jenkins 2002 p. 186 pondering on the history of their love, and explaining to her the reasons why he could not marry, not even to beget a legitimate heir; it would result in his \\"utter overthrow\\":Read 1936 p. 25 > You must think it is some marvellous cause, and toucheth my present state > very near, that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own > house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it > resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should > marry I am sure never to have [the queen's] favour.Read 1936 pp. 25, 24 He continues, proposing that she accept one of the suitors for her hand, who she had so far declined for his sake: \\"The choice falls not oft, and yet I know you may have now of the best; and it is not my part to bid you take them ... so it were not mine honesty to bid you refuse them.\\"Read 1936 pp. 23‚Äì24 However, he says, he still loves her as he did in the beginning.Read 1936 p. 23 Yet he would help her, in case she wanted to marry elsewhere for reasons of respectability: \\"for when you have made your election you shall find me a most willing and ready friend to perform all good offices toward you\\".Read 1936 p. 26 In May 1573, it was observed by the court correspondent Gilbert Talbot that the Earl of Leicester was pursued by Lady Douglas and her sister: > There are two sisters now in the court that are very far in love with him, > as they have long been; my Lady Sheffield and Frances Howard. They (of like > striving who shall love him better) are at great wars together and the queen > thinketh not well of them, and not the better of him.Wilson 1981 p. 207 In August 1574, Douglas's son Robert was born. Leicester acknowledged the paternity of his \\"base son\\"Warner 1899 p. vi and was very fond of him, caring much for his well-being and education.Warner 1899 p. vi; Wilson 1981 p. 246 It is unclear how long Leicester's affair with Lady Sheffield continued, but nearly thirty years later her version of events was that Leicester had wanted to end their relationship around 1578, before his marriage to Lettice Knollys, the widowed Countess of Essex.Adams 2008a She claimed they had met at Greenwich in the garden, where Leicester wanted her to \\"disavow the marriage\\", offering her seven hundred pounds a year, but she had passionately rejected the offer. Leicester also became furious, saying he could as well part from her, leaving her penniless. Upon some reflection, she accepted the offer at last.Jenkins 2002 p. 217 In 1604 Lady Sheffield also claimed that she had refused to surrender the custody of their son, Robert, for fear that his father, Leicester, would have him killed.Adams 2008b However, there is no trace of any disagreement over young Robert's upbringing and whereabouts. He grew up in Leicester's and his friends' houses, having \\"leave to see\\" his mother whenever she wished.Adams 2008c  Second marriage and Star Chamber trial  Sir Robert Dudley, son of Douglas Sheffield On 29 November 1579 Douglas Sheffield married Sir Edward Stafford,Jenkins 2002 p. 249 whose mother, Dorothy Stafford, was very influential with the Queen.Doran 1996 p. 161 From 1583 until 1591 Edward Stafford served as English ambassador to the court of Henry III of France; his wife accompanied him to Paris. There Lady Sheffield became a prominent figure in society and a special friend of Catherine de' Medici, whom she advised about a reform of the French royal household. By Stafford she had two sons, who both died young. The ambassador honoured his wife greatly, but had to cope with the fact that she was still emotionally agitated by remembrances of the Earl of Leicester.Jenkins 2002 p. 298 Stafford was politically opposed to Leicester, and the personal tensions aggravated this rivalry.Jenkins 2002 pp. 285‚Äì286, 325; Haynes 1992 p. 44 After the death of Queen Elizabeth in May 1603, Lady Sheffield's son, Sir Robert Dudley, began trying to claim his father's and his uncle's extinct titles of Earl of Leicester and Earl of Warwick. He said he had been told by a shadowy adventurer called Thomas Drury that his parents had been secretly married.Warner 1899 p. xli The case ended up in the Star Chamber and aroused great public interest between 1604 and 1605. The court heard ninety witnesses for Dudley and fifty-seven for Leicester's widow, Lettice Knollys. Lady Sheffield did not attend the trial in person, but she declared in writing that Leicester had solemnly contracted to marry her in Cannon Row, Westminster, in 1571, and that they were married at Esher, Surrey, \\"in wintertime\\" in 1573. Yet all of the ten putative witnesses (\\"besides others\\") to the ceremony were long dead since. Neither could she remember who the clergyman was, nor the exact date of the marriage.Warner 1899 pp. xl-xli As an explanation for marrying Edward Stafford, she asserted that Leicester had tried to poison her and, \\"life being sweet\\", she had determined to marry \\"for safeguard of her life\\".Warner 1899 p. xlv The Star Chamber rejected the evidence and fined several of the witnesses. It was concluded that Sir Robert Dudley had been duped by Thomas Drury, who in his turn had sought \\"his own private gains\\". Sir Edward Stafford died while the proceedings in the Star Chamber were in progress. Required to answer questions for the case, he maintained that Sir Robert Dudley had \\"terrified\\" his mother into supporting him against her deep reservations. Stafford wrote that he had asked his wife in December 1579, on the Queen's command, if she had been contracted to Leicester, to which \\"she answered with great vows, grief and passion that she had trusted the said earl too much to have anything to show to constrain him to marry her.\\" Douglas Sheffield died in early December 1608 at Westminster.

The camera system also claims to be the smallest interchangeable-lens SLR system ever created. The cameras and lenses were very small (the camera fits in the palm of a hand easily).  Auto 110  Asahi Pentax Auto 110 The Pentax Auto 110 features fully automatic exposure, with no user-settable exposure compensation or adjustments. Metering is TTL (through-the-lens) and center-weighted. Unlike 35 mm SLRs, the system's lenses do not have a built-in iris to control the aperture. Instead, an iris is mounted inside the camera body, and functions as both an aperture control and a shutter. This mechanism is capable of programmed exposures between 1/750 s at f/13.5; and 1 s at f/2.8. To ensure that light travelling past the diaphragm blades could not get through to the film over time, the camera's mirror system also functions as a light-tight seal when in the viewing and focusing position. Since the iris is part of the camera, all of the system's lenses had to be constructed with an f/2.8 aperture. The lens' designs, based upon the film dimensions, result in the 24 mm lens being the 'normal' focal length (i.e. equivalent angle of view to a 50 mm lens on a 135 format camera), while lenses of wider angles or longer focal lengths were larger. =Film speed detection= The camera detects the film speed by the presence or absence of a ridge on the cartridge, as specified in the Kodak 110 film standard. Since there is no official specification of what the film speeds should actually be--they were just \\"low\\" and \\"high\\"--film and camera manufacturers had to decide for themselves the meaning. Pentax chose ISO 80 and 320 as their settings, but commercially available films at ISO 100 and 400 are close enough to work in practice. A film with an ISO 200 speed would result in either under- or over-exposure. The exposure latitude of color print films is about 2 f/stops (meaning that a photographer could expose either 2 f/stops under or 2 f/stops over the exposure set by the camera). Unfortunately, some recently produced 110 film is rated at ISO 400, but is packaged with the ridge indicating \\"low\\". If this is the case, the ridge must be removed (by filing or cutting with a sharp blade) for the camera to expose correctly. Since only a few 110 cameras ever supported the ISO auto-selection, this does not affect the majority of cameras using the format but does affect the Pentax Auto 110. In 2012/2013 ISO 100 film has been produced and marketed under the Lomography label, and gives excellent results, without the need to modify the cartridge casing. The camera was offered in a special edition \\"Safari\\" model, identical to the Auto 110 except for the brown-and-tan color scheme.  Auto 110 Super  Asahi Pentax Auto 110 Super Asahi Pentax Auto 110 Super Introduced in late 1982, the Super is identical in basic shape and size to the previous model and accepts the same lenses. Many improvements and changes were included to make this model arguably a better camera than the previous Auto 110. Film winding is improved with a single-stroke film advance lever that advances the film and cocks the shutter in one winding (the Auto 110 takes two strokes to advance the film). A switch around the shutter release button enables a new ten-second self-timer mode and a shutter lock; the self-timer activates a red light on the pentaprism housing, which flashes during the 10-second shutter release count-down. A button on the front on the user's left hand side gives a +1.5 EV (exposure value) backlit scene exposure compensation. The optional winder offers an improved battery cover, a well- known weak component in the Auto 110. The shutter button is protected from accidental tripping by an altered casing around the button. The flash synchronization socket cover on the Super is permanently attached to the camera in an attempt to prevent loss, though many still go missing when the plastic tether breaks. The viewfinder screen has a split image rangefinder center, surrounded by a microprism collar, whereas the Auto 110 has the split image rangefinder center only. The low light warning activates at 1/45 s (the Auto 110 activates at 1/30 s).  Lenses  The line of lenses consisted of these three at launch: * 18 mm f/2.8 wide-angle lens (equivalent angle of view to a 35 mm lens on a 135 format camera). * 24 mm f/2.8 normal lens (equiv. 50 mm). The optical design meant that this was the smallest lens on the system. * 50 mm f/2.8 telephoto lens (equiv. 100 mm) In 1981, three more lenses were included: * 18 mm \\"Pan Focus\\" lens was a compact lens of fixed focus set to the hyperfocal distance; the short focal length and wide aperture meant that its depth of field stretched from 1.75 m (5.7 ft) to infinity. The camera aperture needed to be set at f/6.3 for this lens to work as intended. * 70 mm f/2.8 telephoto lens (equiv. 140 mm) * 20‚Äì40 mm f/2.8 zoom lens (equiv. 40‚Äì80 mm). This lens extended for wider focal lengths and shortened towards the telephoto end. The three later lenses are much rarer. Soligor also made a 1.7x teleconverter. Lens hoods were available for all of the lenses, and Pentax sold add-on close-up lenses for macro photography and a range of filters. The 110 lenses have found a new life with the Pentax Q system, which will accept them with an adapter, albeit with a 5.6x crop factor (effective increase in focal length). The lenses can also be mounted on Panasonic/Olympus Micro Four Thirds cameras with an adapter, and the crop factor is only 2x, the same as on the original Pentax 110 body. Wherever adapted, the lenses still require manual focusing.

The original 110 Winder took 2 AA batteries and could wind through 100 cartridges of 110 film with one set of batteries. It works only in single- shot mode. It takes about 1.5 s to wind a frame. The 110 Winder II, introduced in 1982, adds a continuous shooting mode and improves the battery cover door, which was fragile on the original.  Flash  A custom electronic flash unit, the AF130P, was part of the original Auto 110 system, and was produced until the camera ceased being manufactured. Pentax responded to criticism that this electronic flash unit was too large by introducing the smaller AF100P electronic flash unit in 1980. This unit, however, was never part of the Pentax camera kits and became rare.  Other accessories  Pentax produced a range of various camera-carrying cases and also a belt-clip for the cameras.

It rises behind the Opatija riviera, on the eastern side of the Istrian peninsula. It forms a single morphological unit together with the ƒÜiƒáarija range which stretches from the Bay of Trieste to Rijeka. Uƒçka is a limestone massif with numerous areas of karst, stretching for 20 km from the Poklon Pass (920 m) to Plomin Bay, and is between 4 and 9 km wide.Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 89, Zagreb (1999), It differs from all the other coastal mountains in Croatia because of its abundant vegetation on the seaward side. Best known are the forests of sweet chestnuts in the area around Lovran. Uƒçka's highest peaks are considered nature reserves and memorial areas. The highest peak, Vojak, is located at 1396 meters above sea level. From it there are views over Istria, the Bay of Trieste, the Julian Alps and the Adriatic islands, right down to Dugi Otok. The subject of a degree of local folklore, Uƒçka is visible from much of the peninsula and is snow-capped some months of the year. The town of Opatija () is said to have derived its popularity as a resort in Imperial Austria because it is located \\"in the shade\\" of Mt. Uƒçka, which by legend shields it from the fierce Mediterranean heat in summertime. The area of Uƒçka is designated a nature park (park prirode), a kind of protected area in Croatia. Historically, the Istro-Romanians, a Romance ethnic group of Istria, have been separated by the mountain range, forming two areas of concentration: one in the village of ≈Ωejane and one in the village of ≈†u≈°njevica and the surrounding settlements. Although these areas are 50 kilometers away from each other, there is a road around the Uƒçka that connects them.

It was released in 1973 by Warner Bros. Records. The album is an amalgamation of several different genres, including blues, folk, jazz, New Orleans rhythm and blues, and calypso. The 10 tracks on the album are covers, and range from soft sentimental ballads to upbeat, rhythmic-heavy tracks. Lowell George was originally hired to handle the production, but was ultimately replaced by John Hall when Raitt became unhappy with his production. Takin' My Time received positive reviews from music critics, while it reached number 87 on the US Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart. Retrospective reviews have also been positive, with critics praising the eclecticism. Critics commended Raitt's attempts to broaden her musical horizon. Vik Iyengar of AllMusic believed the album was Raitt's last consistent album up to her comeback in the mid-1980s. Raitt went on an accompanying tour of the United States. Background and composition In 1973, Raitt moved to Los Angeles, and became friends with members of American rock band Little Feat. After the release of their third album Dixie Chicken (1973), Little Feat broke up, with Raitt hiring the frontman Lowell George to produce her upcoming album. Raitt was unhappy with George's production, which she said was due to a lack of objectivity. According to Raitt: \\"It became too emotional. It's hard having a strong woman telling the man her ideas when, in fact, the man wants to take over the situation.\\" American musician John Hall was then brought in for production to replace George. Under the direction of Hall, Takin' My Time was recorded from June to July 1973 at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles. Takin' My Time combines many different music genres, including blues, folk, jazz, New Orleans rhythm and blues, and calypso. Takin' My Time is similar to Raitt's previous studio album Give It Up (1972), as both albums feature a mix of soft sentimental ballads and upbeat, rhythmic-heavy tracks. The sentimental ballads focus on romance and heartache, and possess a \\"late night, bluesy intimacy,\\" according to No Depression. The upbeat tracks vary in genre; \\"Wah She Go Do\\" is a calypso and reggae-inspired track, while \\"Let Me In\\" is a dance track, inspired by polka and ragtime. All 10 tracks on the album are covers of songs from musicians like Jackson Browne, Randy Newman, and Calypso Rose. Release and reception Takin' My Time was released in October 1973, through Warner Bros. Records. It reached number 87 on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart, and number 91 on the Record World album chart. Raitt supported the album with a continuous touring schedule across the United States; biographer Mark Bego described Raitt's approach to touring as a \\"perform-pack-unpack-perform lifestyle.\\" Takin' My Time was met with positive reviews from music critics. The staff of Billboard described the album as \\"a top mix of blues and ballads such as 'I Gave My Love a Candle' from one of poo's [sic] most underrated female vocalists.\\" A critic for Record World highlighted Hall's production, and wrote: \\"Bonnie's beautiful voice and super blues guitar playing grace a collection of wonderful songs.\\" Tony Glover of Rolling Stone felt that despite the large amount of musical variety, Takin' My Time was Raitt's most cohesive album. Glover commended the musicianship between Raitt and the backup musicians, with him writing that \\"it's evident a lot of her soul went into this one, and that makes it worth hearing.\\" Retrospective reviews of Takin' My Time from critics have also been positive. In his book Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies, Robert Christgau commended Raitt's attempt to broaden her musical scope with more ecletic tracks such as \\"You've Been in Love Too Long\\" and \\"Wah She Go Do\\". Christgau wrote more negatively towards some of the folk-inspired tracks, which he called \\"too pretty, too ordinary.\\" Robert Gordon of Entertainment Weekly praised the wide musical variety on Takin' My Time, with him saying: \\"Raitt sounds comfortable singing rhythmic rockers, slow songs, and a swinging New Orleans tune, 'Let Me In.' The lighthearted calypso 'Wah She Go Do' may be just a lark, but it's definitely fun.\\" Vik Iyengar of AllMusic felt Raitt had done a good job at choosing and interpreting the 10 cover tracks, and called Takin' My Time an \\"underrated gem.\\" Iyengar believed Takin' My Time was Raitt's last consistent album until her comeback in the mid-1980s.

He was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1990 to 2011, representing the riding of Bruce‚ÄîGrey‚ÄîOwen Sound. Background Murdoch was educated at the Owen Sound Collegiate and Vocational Institute, and worked as a farmer, electrical draftsman, film stripper and salesman. He is also a Freemason and a member of the Royal Canadian Legion. He served as chair of the Grey Sauble Conservation Authority for five years. Politics =Municipal= Murdoch began his political career at the municipal level, serving in for four years as a councillor in Sydenham Township, and as reeve for a further eight. He was elected warden of Grey County in 1987. Murdoch served as vice-president of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario for two years, and was a member of the board of directors for five years. =Provincial= Murdoch's first bid to enter the Ontario legislature was unsuccessful. He ran as a Progressive Conservative for the riding of Grey in the 1987 Ontario election, in which the Liberals under David Peterson won a landslide majority. Murdoch lost to Liberal Ron Lipsett by about 2000 votes. The Liberals saw their support base decline during the 1990 election, however, and Murdoch was able to win the seat on his second attempt, defeating New Democrat Peggy Hutchinson by about 2500 votes (Lipsett finished third). Murdoch was easily re-elected in the provincial elections of 1995 and 1999, both of which were won by the Progressive Conservatives under Mike Harris. He developed a reputation as a party maverick, and was never seriously considered for a cabinet appointment. Murdoch's political philosophy is somewhat eccentric, and defies easy summarization. He has never been afraid to criticize his own party, whether in government or opposition. He opposed the Harris government's decision to cancel the province's spring bear hunt, and claims that he was fired from a parliamentary assistant position after calling for more free votes in the house. He once demanded a recorded vote on a same-sex benefits bill brought forward by the McGuinty government. Only 3 of the required 5 members stood to request a recorded vote and the Bill passed on an unrecorded voice vote. Murdoch's riding included the town of Walkerton, (since the provincial riding re-organization, Walkerton is in Huron-Bruce) which suffered from a deadly outbreak of E. coli in 2000 as a result of polluted water. Some criticized Murdoch for rejecting the possibility that his government's cutbacks could have been partly responsible for the outbreak. The Progressive Conservatives lost the 2003 election, though Murdoch was re- elected in his own riding. After the election, he considered sitting as a member of the New Democratic Party; not for ideological reasons, but in order to give the NDP official party status in the legislature after it fell one short of the required eight seats. Though Murdoch's beliefs are far removed from NDP policy, he claimed he was willing to cross the floor because the party deserved a voice in the legislature. The plan was seriously considered by NDP leader Howard Hampton, but came to nothing. The NDP subsequently won a by-election, and regained party status on their own. During the 2007 Ontario election, Murdoch sparked controversy by being the first PC caucus member to publicly oppose PC party leader John Tory's proposal to publicly fund all private religious schools in the province. Murdoch stated that although he initially supported the plan, the widespread opposition to it by his constituents convinced him to reconsider his position. He has stated that should the issue come before the legislature, he would vote against it. Tory, commenting on Murdoch's position, stated \\"When you look up maverick in the dictionary you find his picture there ‚Äî in colour...\\" On September 12, 2008, he was suspended from the Progressive Conservative caucus for openly calling for Tory's resignation. On September 18, 2008, he was permanently expelled from the Progressive Conservative caucus and sat as an Independent member of the legislature. On April 23, 2009, Progressive Conservative interim leader Bob Runciman announced Murdoch would be returning to the PC caucus, effective immediately. On July 5, 2010, Murdoch announced that he would retire following the 2011 provincial election, which saw the Progressive Conservatives maintain their hold on the Bruce-Grey-Owen Sound riding under first-time MPP Bill Walker. After politics Murdoch, since retiring from politics, has been hosting an open-line radio talk show on CFOS 560 AM (Owen Sound, Ontario) on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings (9-10 AM Eastern Time) which, dependent upon the day of the week, is identified on air as \\"Murdoch Mondays\\", \\"Mid-week with Murdoch\\" and/or \\"Rock and Talk with Murdoch\\". In addition to talk, the program also showcases the music of local (mainly Grey and Bruce counties) recording artists.

Its titular hero, \\"Mayhem\\", is a yellow triceratops blessed with the gift of speed. His goal is to return his world from sad to happy, ridding the world of monsters along the way.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. At the beginning of each stage the goals are displayed to the player. There are two types of quota to be met. The first is magic dust quota where enemies must be defeated to gain magic dust. Enemies may be killed in two ways. Enemies may be bounced on. Mayhem bounces upwards a small amount when destroying an enemy like this. Once the lightning power up has been obtained, enemies may also be charged at with speed in a special attack. Monsters are not always simple to dispatch as some have spikes and others shells. Soft spots on such enemies have to be found by the player in order to defeat them. Happier music plays once all the enemies are defeated. It is then a race against the clock to collect the quota of stars and to get to the exit to complete the stage. The faster a star is rotating, the more points it is worth. If all stars are collected on a stage, then the player can receive a Super-Star bonus, but only on the first and last stage of the game on the cassette and disk versions of the game.  Synopsis  An apprentice magician dinosaur living in Monsterland, Theo Saurus, made a mistake while practising a spell one day. He turned the lands Jellyland, Pipeland, Spottyland, Cherryland, and Rockland into sad places, void of color or life. Theo began living in a hidden cave to avoid the wrath of the other monsters until discovered one day by the hero of the story, Mayhem. Mayhem promised to bring Theo the necessary magic dust to transform Monsterland to its previous happy state.  Development  Mayhem in Monsterland was produced by Apex Computer Productions, who had previously made Creatures and Creatures 2, which featured Clyde Radcliffe as the main character. Mayhem was far lighter in tone than Creatures, which featured end-of-level action puzzles that, if not successfully accomplished, meant death by various gruesome means.  Release  The game was released on the European Virtual Console online store for the Nintendo Wii system on 17 October 2008. In 2009, a 15th Anniversary Edition of the game was released on cassette and disk by British retro publisher Psytronik Software. The same publisher later released a 25th Anniversary Edition in 2019.  Reception and legacy  The game received a 97% in Commodore Force and a 100% in Commodore Format, which had chronicled the game's development. A new game for mobile phones starring Mayhem, Mayhem's Magic Dust, was released in 2004. It was developed by Infinite Lives.

College Regan played college soccer at Bradley University from 1999 to 2002, where he established himself as one of the best players in the program's history. After starting 20 games as a freshman, Regan was named second-team All-Missouri Valley Conference as a sophomore, after registering two goals and two assists from a defensive midfield position. Regan was moved to defense as a junior, and proved more than up to the task - he finished the year as a first-team All-MVC winner, and the team's co-MVP with Gavin Glinton. Regan remained at defense as a senior and performed even better, winning MVC Defensive Player of the Year while being instrumental in the team posting a 0.81 goals against average. Professional Upon graduating, Regan was selected 17th overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by MetroStars of Major League Soccer. Regan was versatile, but not overly impressive in MLS. As a rookie, he appeared in 15 games, starting seven, at numerous positions in the defense and midfield. Regan received less playing time in 2004, playing in just 12 games. His hard work was rewarded with an expanded role in 2005, as he started 18 out of 20 matches. However, on March 1, 2006, Regan was released by MetroStars. One month later he was signed by his former Metro coach Bob Bradley at Chivas USA where he became a surprise starter. After the 2006 season, Regan was picked up by Toronto FC in the 2006 MLS Expansion Draft, but later traded to New York Red Bulls (the former MetroStars) for forward Edson Buddle. He was waived by New York during the 2007 season. In the spring of 2008, Regan trained with Chicago Fire and appeared in a preseason games for his hometown club, but was not offered a contract.

Early life  McKennan was born in New Castle, Delaware on March 31, 1794, the son of Col. William and Elizabeth Thompson McKennan. He later moved with his family to Washington, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Washington College in 1810 and was admitted to the bar in 1814, commencing practice in Washington.

In a January 1811 speech to the Union Society, McKennan outlined the seven areas of study (Latin and Greek; Mathematics; Rhetoric; Logic; Geography and History; Natural Philosophy; and Moral Philosophy) that comprised the college's curriculum at the time. He worked as a tutor at Washington College in 1813, as he was studying law. Later, he was a Trustee of the College and was often asked to be President of Washington College, but he refused every time. =Pennsylvania politics= He was deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania from 1815 to 1816, and served on the Town Council in Washington, Pennsylvania, from 1818 to 1830, and was elected to the twenty-second congress in 1830. He served in the United States House of Representatives from 1831 to 1839, where he made a protective tariff his top priority. McKennan refused to stand as a candidate again in the 1838 elections, and retired from Congress. He served again from 1842 to 1843 as both an Anti-Masonic and Whig to complete the term of his late successor Joseph Lawrence. (The special election was set for May 20, 1842.) He was the chairman of the Committee on Roads and Canals in the twenty-seventh congress. Despite immense pressure from associates, friends, and the Washington County Whig Party, McKennan again refused to run for another term in Congress, declaring that he had done his duty by serving in public office, and it was time to return to Washington, Pennsylvania, and focus on his law practice. In 1844, his supporters in his hometown of Washington, Pennsylvania, unsuccessfully tried to stir up interest in McKennan as a running mate for Henry Clay, and there is no indication that McKennan himself approved of the idea. McKennan also resisted efforts to entice him to run for governor of Pennsylvania in the 1840s, but in 1848, he served as president of the Pennsylvania electoral college. =Secretary of the Interior= Upon Millard Fillmore becoming the President of the United States, McKennan was offered the position of the United States Secretary of the Interior, but was reluctant to accept; only after intense pressure from friends and associates did he relent. Almost immediately, he regretted his decision, and resigned after a tenure of only 11 days. McKennan cited his \\"peculiar nervous temperament\\" which responded to excitement and depression for his reason to resign.Eugene P. Trani, The Secretaries of the Department of the Interior 1849-1969 (National Anthropological Archives, 1975), p. 68 During his brief time as Secretary, McKennan was the head of the 1850 Census, which was being conducted that summer, and he issued a remarkably foresighted statement on the importance of protecting individual privacy: > Information has been received at this office that in some cases unnecessary > exposure has been made by the assistant marshals with reference to the > business and pursuits, and other facts relating to individuals, merely to > gratify curiosity, or the facts applied to the private use or pecuniary > advantage of the assistant, to the injury of others.

M.T. McKennan, Circular to the United > States Marshals and Assistants, cited in \\"Census Confidentiality and > Privacy: 1790-2002.\\" =Later career= Following his resignation, McKennan took on a less stressful job as the president of the Hempfield Railroad, which was then under construction between Wheeling, Virginia, and Greensburg, Pennsylvania, through his own town of Washington (in 1871, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad purchased the financially hobbled Hempfield). Personal life On December 6, 1815, McKennan married Matilda Lourie Bowman. They had eight children together: *William McKennan *Thomas McKennan *Isabella McKennan *Jacob Bowman McKennan *Thomas McKean Thompson McKennan, Jr. *Anne Elizabeth McKennan *John Thompson McKennan *Matilda Bowman McKennan McKennan died on July 9, 1852, in Reading, Pennsylvania, while on Hempfield Railroad business, and was interred at the Washington Cemetery in his long-time home of Washington, Pennsylvania.

He is regarded as one of the Valiant Sixty, who were early Quaker preachers and missionaries. Conversion Burrough was born in Underbarrow, Westmorland, and educated in the Church of England, but became a Presbyterian before converting to Quakerism. During his late teens, he heard George Fox preach in 1652 and immediately converted to what later came to be known as the Religious Society of Friends. He was consequently rejected by his parents. Burrough began itinerant preaching throughout England, travelling with another Friend, Francis Howgill. Among those converted by them was Hester Biddle, probably in 1654. Debate During the years 1656‚Äì1657 Burrough and John Bunyan were engaged in a pamphlet debate, begun by Bunyan, who published Some Gospel Truths Opened, in which he attacked Quaker beliefs. Burrough responded with The True Faith of the Gospel of Peace. Bunyan countered with A Vindication of Some Gospel Truths Opened, which Burrough answered with Truth (the Strongest of All) Witnessed Forth. Later the Quaker leader George Fox entered the fray by publishing a refutation of Bunyan's essay in The Great Mystery of the Great Whore Unfolded. Intervention with the king Upon the Restoration in 1660, Burrough approached King Charles II requesting protection and relief of Quakers in New England, who were being persecuted by Puritans there. Charles granted him an audience in 1661, and was persuaded to issue a writ stopping (temporarily) the corporal and capital punishments of the Quakers in Massachusetts. Burrough arranged for the writ to be delivered by Samuel Shattuck, himself a Quaker under a ban from Massachusetts. Charles's writ commanded the Massachusetts authorities to send the imprisoned Quakers to England for trial, but they chose instead to release them. The king's order effectively stopped the hangings, but imprisonments and floggings were resumed the next year. Imprisonment and death In 1662, Burrough was arrested for holding a meeting, which was illegal under the terms of the Quaker Act. He was sent to Newgate Prison, London. An order for his release signed by Charles II was ignored by the local authorities, and Burrough remained in Newgate until his death on February 14, 1663, aged just 29 (\\"twelfth month 1662\\" in the Old Style and Quaker terminologies). He was buried in the Quaker Burying Ground, Bunhill Fields. After his death, his collected works were published by E. Hookes in 1671 as The Memorable Works of a Son of Thunder and Consolation: Namely, that True Prophet, and Faithful Servant of God, and Sufferer for the Testimony of Jesus, Edward Burroughs, who Dyed a Prisoner for the Word of God, in the City of London, the Fourteenth of the Twelfth Moneth, 1662.

History An 1853 advertisement for Boston Locomotive Works The company that was to become known as Hinkley Locomotive Works got its start in Boston in 1831. Holmes Hinkley and his partner Daniel F. Child founded the Boston Machine Works and soon built the third stationary steam engine that was constructed in Massachusetts. The company's first locomotive was a 4-2-0 built in 1840 that followed the roughly standard designs of the 1830s. Hinkley's early locomotives closely resembled those designed by John Souther. The company gained a reputation as a reliable and respectable locomotive builder and grew to become the largest manufacturer in New England within a decade. In 1848 the company reorganized as the Boston Locomotive Works and operated under that name until foreclosure due to the financial panic in 1859. After reorganization under Jarvis Williams, the company became Hinkley, Williams and Company. Hinkley, who had been forced out in the foreclosure, returned to the company in another reorganization in 1864 as the Hinkley and Williams Locomotive Works. The company produced locomotives for the railroads of the American Civil War and regained some of the earlier profitability that they had enjoyed earlier in the century. In 1872 the company was renamed to Hinkley Locomotive Works but soon fell into bankruptcy again by the end of the decade. This bankruptcy led to the 1880 reorganization as the Hinkley Locomotive Company. Orders fell off and the company was permanently closed in 1889. The only Hinkley locomotive known to be preserved is a 9-ton 0-4-0 built in 1846 as the Lion for the Machiasport Railroad of eastern Maine. It is preserved at the Maine State Museum in Augusta, Maine.Rivard, 1987 Another Hinkley engine still exists but not in its original form. In 1879, the Hinkley Locomotive Works built a 4-4-0 named \\"H. C. Hardon\\", and numbered 73, for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe. This engine was converted to a 2-8-0 wheel arrangement, now numbered 643, by the Santa Fe shops in 1897 and it served the Santa Fe until its retirement c1953. This engine, not currently in operating condition, is now located in the Oklahoma Railway Museum, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

He is the top goalscorer in the history of the Colombian Categor√≠a Primera A with 224 goals. Club career Galv√°n Rey's first club was Boca Juniors of his native Argentina, where he did not achieve much success. Galv√°n Rey joined Colombian club Once Caldas in 1994, and proceeded to become one of the most dangerous forwards in Colombia. He scored 171 goals in his career with Once Caldas, 160 in the Colombian league, and 11 in 15 Copa Libertadores matches. In 2003, Galv√°n Rey helped Once Caldas to win the Colombian championship, their first in 53 years; additionally, he led the team to achieve Copa Libertadores qualification in 1999, 2002, and 2004. For the 2004 MLS season, Once Caldas sold Galv√°n Rey to the MetroStars for a transfer fee in the range of half a million dollars. Although he played in 20 games, starting 10, Galv√°n Rey finished the year with only two goals and one assist. Galv√°n Rey's previous club, Once Caldas, went on to win the Copa Libertadores in his absence. In 2005 Galv√°n Rey played better than the previous year, scoring two goals against the Kansas City Wizards to bring the MetroStars back from a 2‚Äì0 deficit. By the end of the season, he tallied eight goals in all competitions, which had him tied for the team's third leading scorer. However, his salary demands were overwhelming, and the MetroStars decided not to bring Galv√°n Rey back for 2006. He then signed with Atl√©tico Nacional. In the first half of the 2006 season at Atl√©tico Nacional, Sergio Galv√°n Rey tallied 11 goals. He put his renewed form on display against Am√©rica de Cali on 21 May scoring 5 goals in a single match. Galv√°n Rey finished the 2006 campaign with a total of 19 goals. His last goal of the season came on 2 December 2006 against Boyac√° Chic√≥ F.C. in a 2‚Äì1 win for Nacional. The 2007 season started well for Galv√°n Rey when he netted a goal in Nacional's first match against La Equidad. He managed to tally a total of 13 goals in the first half of the season with his last goal coming during a tournament match against Boyac√° Chic√≥ on 10 June 2007. He tallied 6 more goals through December 2007. He scored two against Cucuta Deportivo on 8 December 2007. In 2008, Galv√°n Rey started the season with 4 goals through July. Entering November 2008, he added 7 more goals to his season total. In 2010, Galv√°n Rey joined Am√©rica de Cali. He started the season only 5 goals away from becoming the all time scorer in Colombian League history. On 25 April, he became the highest scorer in the Colombian League, surpassing Iv√°n Valenciano as the all time scorer. In 2011, he joined Independiente Santa Fe and played one season with them, scoring 3 goals in 23 appearances. He announced his retirement after the season ended.

The lunar crater Autolycus was named in his honour.  Life and work  Autolycus was born in Pitane, a town of Aeolis within Ionia, Asia Minor. Of his personal life nothing is known, although he was a contemporary of Aristotle and his works seem to have been completed in Athens between 335‚Äì300 BC. Euclid references some of Autolycus' work, and Autolycus is known to have taught Arcesilaus. Autolycus' surviving works include a book on spheres entitled On the Moving Sphere (Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ Œ∫ŒπŒΩŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ∑œÇ œÉœÜŒ±ŒØœÅŒ±œÇ) and another On Risings and Settings (Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ·ºêœÄŒπœÑŒøŒª·ø∂ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ¥œçœÉŒµœâŒΩ) of celestial bodies. Autolycus' works were translated by Maurolycus in the sixteenth century. On the Moving Sphere is believed to be the oldest mathematical treatise from ancient Greece that is completely preserved. All Greek mathematical works prior to Autolycus' Sphere are taken from later summaries, commentaries, or descriptions of the works. One reason for its survival is that it had originally been a part of a widely used collection called \\"Little Astronomy\\", which was preserved by translation into Arabic in the 9th century. In Europe it was lost, but was brought back during the Crusades in the 12th century, and translated back into Latin.Theodosius of Bithynia In his Sphere, Autolycus studied the characteristics and movement of a sphere. The work is simple and not exactly original, since it consists of only elementary theorems on spheres that would be needed by astronomers, but its theorems are clearly enunciated and proved. Its prime significance, therefore, is that it indicates that by his day there was a thoroughly established textbook tradition in geometry that is today regarded as typical of classical Greek geometry. The theorem statement is clearly enunciated, a figure of the construction is given alongside the proof, and finally a concluding remark is made. Moreover, it gives indications of what theorems were well known in his day (around 320 BC). Two hundred years later Theodosius' wrote Sphaerics, a book that is believed to have a common origin with On the Moving Sphere in some pre-Euclidean textbook, possibly written by Eudoxus. In astronomy, Autolycus studied the relationship between the rising and the setting of the celestial bodies in his treatise in two books entitled On Risings and Settings. The second book is actually an expansion of his first book and of higher quality. He wrote that \\"any star which rises and sets always rises and sets at the same point in the horizon.\\" Autolycus relied heavily on Eudoxus' astronomy and was a strong supporter of Eudoxus' theory of homocentric spheres.

She took part in antisubmarine warfare projects and fleet exercises off Florida and Bermuda and in the Caribbean until returning to Groton 26 February 1947. After extensive modernization, she returned to Key West 2 March 1948. She continued to conduct training and join in exercises off Florida and in the Caribbean until her first tour of duty in the Mediterranean with the 6th Fleet from 16 July 1952 to 15 October. Returning to local operations off Key West, she also participated in large-scale fleet exercises in the Atlantic and Caribbean. She cruised to the British Isles from 11 March to 16 May 1957, and upon her return to Key West, continued training and services to the Fleet Sonar School. Through 1958 and 1959, she operated frequently in ordnance tests, and from August 1959, when Charleston, South Carolina, became her home port, cruised widely along the east coast.

In 1864, Jefferson Davis asked Thompson to lead a delegation to Canada, where he appears to have been leader of the Confederate Secret Service. From here, he is known to have organised many anti-Union plots and was suspected of many more, including a possible meeting with Lincoln's assassin, John Wilkes Booth. Union troops burned down his mansion in Oxford, Mississippi, the hometown of William Faulkner, who based some of his fictional characters on Thompson. Biography Born in Leasburg, North Carolina in 1810 to Nicolas Thompson and Lucretia (van Hook) Thompson, Thompson attended Bingham Academy in Orange County, North Carolina and later went on to graduate from the University of North Carolina in 1831, where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. Afterwards, he served on the university faculty for a short time until he left to study law in 1832. He was admitted to the bar in 1834 and commenced practice in Pontotoc, Mississippi. President Buchanan and his Cabinet From left to right: Jacob Thompson, Lewis Cass, John B. Floyd, James Buchanan, Howell Cobb, Isaac Toucey, Joseph Holt and Jeremiah S. Black, (c. 1859) Thompson got involved in politics and was elected to the 26th Congress, serving from 1839 to 1851. He was appointed to the United States Senate in 1845 but never received the commission, and the seat went to Joseph W. Chalmers. Thompson was the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs in the 29th Congress. He lost reelection to the 32nd Congress and went back to practicing law until 1857, when newly elected President James Buchanan appointed Thompson United States Secretary of the Interior. In the later years of the Buchanan administration, the cabinet members argued with one another on issues of slavery and secession. In an 1859 speech, Thompson advanced a moderate unionist position. He denounced Republicans in the North who spoke of the slavery issue as an \\"irrepressible conflict\\" and Southern extremists who favored reopening the Atlantic slave trade. =Thompson's alignment with the Confederacy= While still serving as Treasury Secretary, Thompson was appointed by the state of Mississippi as a \\"secession commissioner\\" to North Carolina, with the task of trying to convince that state to secede from the Union in the wake of the 1860 presidential election. On December 17, he passed through Baltimore on the way to North Carolina. \\"Secretary Thompson has entered openly into the secession service, while professing still to serve the Federal authority,\\" the New York Times reported on December 20. The next day, Thompson met with Governor John W. Ellis in Raleigh. He wrote an open letter to Ellis which was published in the Raileigh State Journal on December 20. Thompson wrote that the South faced \\"common humiliation and ruin\\" if it remained in the Union. He warned that a Northern \\"majority trained from infancy to hate our people and their institutions\\" would overthrow slavery. The result would be \\"the subjugation of our people.\\" Thompson resigned as Interior Secretary in January 1861. When he resigned, Horace Greeley's New- York Daily Tribune denounced him as \\"a traitor\\", remarking, \\"Undertaking to overthrow the Government of which you are a sworn minister may be in accordance with the ideas of cotton-growing chivalry, but to common men cannot be made to appear creditable.\\"New-York Daily Tribune, January 9, 1861, p. 4. Thompson became Inspector General of the Confederate States Army. Though not a military man, Thompson later joined the army as an officer and served as an aide to General P.G.T. Beauregard at the Battle of Shiloh. He attained the rank of lieutenant colonel and was present at several other battles in the Western Theater of the war, including Corinth, Vicksburg, and Tupelo. =Commissioner in Canada= In March 1864, Jefferson Davis asked Thompson to lead a secret delegation in Canada. He accepted and arrived in Montreal in May of that year. Thompson appears to have been the leader of Confederate Secret Service operations in Canada. From there, he directed a failed plot to free Confederate prisoners of war on Johnson's Island, off Sandusky, Ohio, in September. He also arranged the purchase of a steamer, with the intention of arming it to harass shipping in the Great Lakes. Regarded in the North as a schemer and conspirator, many devious plots were associated with his name, though much of this may have been public hysteria. On June 13, 1864, Thompson met with former New York governor Washington Hunt at Niagara Falls.p. 145, Castleman, John Breckenridge. Active Service. Louisville, KY: Courier-Journal Job Printing, 1917. According to the testimony of Peace Democrat Clement Vallandigham, Hunt met Thompson, talked to him about creating a Northwestern Confederacy, and obtained money for arms, which was routed to a subordinate. Thompson gave Ben Woods, the owner of the New York Daily News, money to purchase arms.p. 146, Castleman, John Breckenridge. Active Service. Louisville, KY: Courier-Journal Job Printing, 1917. One plot was a planned burning of New York City on November 25, 1864, in retaliation for Union Generals Philip Sheridan and William Tecumseh Sherman's scorched-earth tactics in the South.p. 54, Benn Pitman. United States. Army. Military Commission (Lincoln Assassins: 1865). The Assassination of President Lincoln and the Trial of the Conspirators. Cincinnati, OH: Moore, Wilstach & Baldwin, 1865. Some speculate that John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated Abraham Lincoln, met with Thompson, but this has not been proven. (Thompson worked hard to clear his name of involvement in the assassination in the years after the war.) His manor, called \\"Home Place\\", in Oxford, Mississippi was burned down by Union troops in 1864. Post-war After the Civil War, Thompson fled to England and later returned to Canada as he waited for passions to cool in the United States. He eventually came home and settled in Memphis, Tennessee, to manage his extensive holdings. Thompson was later appointed to the board of the University of the South at Sewanee and was a great benefactor of the school. Death Jacob Thompson died in Memphis and was interred in Elmwood Cemetery.

Recording and music Bonnie Raitt was allotted $10,000 by Warner Bros. Records to record Streetlights, which was the least amount of money she had received to record an album. Warner Bros. was unhappy with the lengthy production surrounding her previous album, Takin' My Time, and the company limited her expenses. The two parties eventually agreed on an advance of more money, on the condition Raitt would choose a producer with a history of commercial success. Raitt chose Jerry Ragovoy, who had worked with musicians such as Janis Joplin and Dionne Warwick. Ragovoy felt Raitt's music was bogged down by blues music, and wanted to produce an album with a more slick and polished pop sound. Raitt did not like Ragovoy's decision, but acquiesced, and Streetlights was recorded during the summer of 1974. Critics have described Streetlights as Raitt's first attempt to record music for a mainstream audience. In contrast to the eclectic and laid-back sound of her first three albums, Streetlights features simpler arrangements with more string instrumentation, influenced by pop and R&B; music. It is Raitt's only album in which she does not play the slide guitar. Session musician Freebo said Raitt was negatively affected by the more professional production of Streetlights. \\"The environment changed her singing. She was in a professional world with Streetlights, and had to act like one\\" said Freebo. Nine of the ten tracks on the album are covers of songs by musicians such as Joni Mitchell, James Taylor, and John Prine. The one original track, \\"Ain't Nobody Home\\", was written by Ragovoy. Release and reception Streetlights was released in September 1974, by Warner Bros. Streetlights reached number eighty on the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart. To support the album, Raitt went on a North American tour with Jackson Browne, from September 13 to November 24.

He was the officer in charge on the bridge when the ship collided with an iceberg, and was one of the more than 1500 people who died when the ship sank. His body was never recovered. His death is very mysterious and the circumstances of his death have been subject to much controversy. Life and career Murdoch was born in Dalbeattie in Kirkcudbrightshire (now Dumfries and Galloway), Scotland, the fourth son of Captain Samuel Murdoch, a master mariner, and Jane Muirhead, six of whose children survived infancy. The Murdochs were a long and notable line of Scottish seafarers; his father and grandfather were both sea captains as were four of his grandfather's brothers. Murdoch was educated first at the old Primary School in High Street, and then at the Dalbeattie High School in Alpine Street until he gained his diploma in 1887. Finishing schooling, he followed in the family seafaring tradition and was apprenticed for five years to William Joyce & Coy, Liverpool, but after four years (and four voyages) he was so competent that he passed his second mate's Certificate on his first attempt. He served his apprenticeship aboard the Charles Cosworth of Liverpool, trading to the west coast of South America. From May 1895, he was First Mate on the St. Cuthbert, which sank in a hurricane off Uruguay in 1897. Murdoch gained his Extra Master's Certificate at Liverpool in 1896, at age 23. From 1897 to 1899, he was First Officer aboard the J. Joyce & Co. steel four- masted 2,534-ton barque Lydgate, that traded from New York to Shanghai. Murdoch in his 30s From left to right: Murdoch, Chief Engineer Joseph Evans, Fourth Officer David Alexander and Captain Edward J. Smith, all as seen on the Olympic An officer of the Royal Naval Reserve, he was employed by the White Star Line in 1900. From 1900 to 1912, Murdoch gradually progressed from Second Officer to First Officer and quickly rose to the rank of officer, serving on a successive number of White Star Line vessels, Medic (1900, along with Charles Lightoller, Titanics second officer), Runic (1901‚Äì1903), Arabic (1903), Celtic (1904), Germanic (1904), Oceanic (1905), Cedric (1906), Adriatic (1907‚Äì1911) and Olympic (1911‚Äì1912). In 1903, Murdoch met a 29-year-old New Zealand school teacher named Ada Florence Banks en route to England on either the Runic or the Medic. They began to correspond regularly and on 2 September 1907 they were wed in Southampton at St Denys Church. The marriage register entry was witnessed by Captain William James Hannah and his wife and the addresses given by the bride and groom suggest they were lodging with the Hannahs. Captain Hannah came from a family of seafarers with their roots in Kircudbrightshire like Murdoch, and was Assistant Marine Superintendent for the White Star Line at Southampton. Hannah would see Murdoch for the last time when he witnessed the testing of lifeboats before Titanic departed from Southampton on 10 April 1912. During 1903, Murdoch finally reached the stormy and glamorous North Atlantic run as Second Officer of the new liner Arabic. His cool head, quick thinking and professional judgement averted a disaster when a ship was spotted bearing down on the Arabic out of the darkness. He overrode a command from his superior, Officer Fox, to steer hard-a-port, rushing into the wheelhouse, brushing aside the quartermaster and holding the ship on course. The two ships passed within inches of one another. Any alteration in course would have actually caused a collision. The final stage of Murdoch's career began in May 1911, when he joined the new , at . Intended to outclass the Cunard ships in luxury and size, it needed the most experienced large-liner crew that the White Star Line could find. Captain Edward J. Smith assembled a crew that included Henry Wilde as Chief Officer, Murdoch as First Officer, and Chief Purser Herbert McElroy. On 14 June 1911 Olympic departed on her maiden voyage to New York, arriving there on the 21st. The first indications of what was to come occurred on 20 September when the Olympic had her hull badly damaged in a collision with the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Hawke. Since Murdoch was at his docking-station at the stern during this collision ‚Äì a highly responsible position ‚Äì he found himself giving evidence in the inquiry into an incident that turned into a financial disaster for the White Star Line, as the voyage to New York had to be abandoned and the ship taken to Belfast for repairs, which took a good six weeks. It was thus not until 11 December 1911 that Murdoch rejoined the ship. During the time that he served aboard as First Officer (until some time in March, 1912) there were two further ‚Äì though lesser ‚Äì incidents, striking a sunken wreck and having to have a broken propeller replaced, and nearly running aground while leaving Belfast. However, upon reaching Southampton, he learned that he had been appointed as Chief Officer of the new Titanic, the Olympic sister ship and reputedly the largest and most luxurious one afloat. Lightoller later remarked that \\"three very contented chaps\\" headed north to Belfast, for he had been appointed First Officer, and their friend Davy Blair was to be the new second officer. Awaiting them would be an old Adriatic hand, Joseph Groves Boxhall, as Fourth Officer, and others who would be familiar colleagues, including the now aging Edward J. Smith as Captain and on the verge of retirement. Titanic Murdoch, with an \\"ordinary master's certificate\\" and a reputation as a \\"canny and dependable man\\", had climbed through the ranks of the White Star Line to become one of its foremost senior officers. Murdoch was originally selected as the Chief Officer for Titanics maiden voyage. However, the captain, Edward J. Smith, brought Henry Wilde in as his Chief Officer (from a prior assignment), so Murdoch became the First Officer. Charles Lightoller was in turn reduced to Second Officer, and the original Second, David Blair, would not sail with Titanic at all. Murdoch was on Titanic's bridge at the time of the impact. At approximately 11:39 pm on 14 April 1912, First Officer Murdoch was in charge when a large iceberg directly in the Titanic's path was sighted. Quartermaster Robert Hichens, who was at the helm, and Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall, who may or may not have been on the bridge at the time, both stated that Murdoch gave the order \\"Hard-a-starboard\\", a tiller command which would turn the ship to port (left) by moving the tiller to starboard (right). At the time steering instructions on British ships generally followed the way tillers on sailing vessels are operated, with turns in the opposite direction from the commands. As Walter Lord noted in The Night Lives On, this did not fully change to the \\"steering wheel\\" system of commands in the same directions as turns until 1924. This has been lead to rumours that Murdoch's orders were misinterpreted by the helmsman, resulting in a turn the wrong way. Fourth Officer Boxhall testified that Murdoch set the ship's telegraph to \\"Full Astern\\", but Greaser Frederick Scott and Leading Stoker Frederick Barrett testified that the stoking indicators went from \\"Full\\" to \\"Stop\\". During or right before the collision he may have also given an order (as heard by Quartermaster Alfred Olliver when he walked onto the bridge in the middle of the collision) of \\"Hard a'port\\" (moving the tiller all the way to the port (left) side turning the ship to starboard (right)) in what may have been an attempt to swing the remainder (aft section) away from the berg in a common manoeuvre called a \\"port around\\" (this could explain his comment to the captain \\"I intended to port around it\\"). The fact that such a manoeuvre was executed was supported by other crew members who testified that the stern of the ship never hit the iceberg. The orders that Murdoch gave to avoid the iceberg are debated. According to Oliver, Murdoch ordered the helm \\"hard to port\\" to ward off the stern of the iceberg. Hichens and Boxhall made no mention of the order. However, since the stern avoided the iceberg, it is likely that the order was given and carried out. Despite these efforts, the ship made its fatal collision about 37 seconds after the iceberg had been sighted, opening the first six compartments. After the collision, Murdoch was put in charge of the starboard evacuation during which he launched ten lifeboats. Murdoch perished in the disaster and his body was never recovered. =Death= On the rescue ship Carpathia, coming into New York Harbor, rumors were circulating from a number of survivors that a shooting incident had happened in the ship's final minutes. On A Sea of Glass: The Life & Loss of the R.M.S. Titanic (Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton and Bill Wormstedt), Appendix K: \\"Shots in the Dark: Did an Officer Commit Suicide on the Titanic?\\", ), pg. 305. At least two passengers, Third Class Passenger Eugene Daly and First Class passenger George Rheims, claimed to have seen an officer shoot one or two men and commit suicide by shooting himself. On A Sea of Glass: The Life & Loss of the R.M.S. Titanic (Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton and Bill Wormstedt), Appendix A: \\"Titanic's Technical Specifications & Some Common Technical Misconceptions\\", ), pgs. 305-308. It became widely rumored that Murdoch was that officer. Second Officer Lightoller denied the rumors. In a letter to Murdoch's widow, he claimed that he saw Murdoch working to free Collapsible A and was swept into the sea by the wave washing over the boat deck and that \\"other reports as to the ending are absolutely false\\".101 Things You Thought You Knew About the Titanic - But Didn't! at Google Books.co.uk However, Lightoller's testimony at the U.S inquiry suggests that he was not in a position to witness Murdoch being swept into the sea. It is also possible that Lightoller may have wanted to conceal the suicide, if it occurred, from Murdoch's widow. Later in life, Lightoller, according to a family friend, is said to have admitted that someone he knew did die by suicide that night. In a letter to a Titanic researcher, James O. McGiffin, son of Captain James McGiffin, who was a close personal friend to Murdoch, and served with both Murdoch and Lightoller, said that Lightoller had told his father that Murdoch had shot a man. The alleged incident of an officer's suicide was portrayed in the 1996 miniseries Titanic, and James Cameron's 1997 film Titanic, both presenting Murdoch as the suicide victim. On A Sea of Glass: The Life & Loss of the R.M.S. Titanic (Tad Fitch, J. Kent Layton and Bill Wormstedt), Appendix K: \\"Shots in the Dark: Did an Officer Commit Suicide on the Titanic?\\", ), pg. 305. When Murdoch's nephew Scott saw the film, he objected to his uncle's portrayal as damaging to Murdoch's heroic reputation, and film executives later flew to Murdoch's hometown to apologize. The film's director, James Cameron, said that the depiction wasn't meant to be negative, and added, \\"I'm not sure you'd find that same sense of responsibility and total devotion to duty today. This guy had half of his lifeboats launched before his counterpart on the port side had even launched one. That says something about character and heroism.\\"James Cameron‚Äôs Titanic, p. 129. Legacy Shortly after the sinking of the Titanic, the New York Herald published a story about Rigel, a dog reportedly owned by Murdoch who saved some of the survivors from the sinking. While the story was widely reproduced, contemporary analyses cast doubt on whether the dog actually existed. The memorial to William Murdoch in Dalbeattie. In Murdoch's hometown of Dalbeattie, Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, a memorial was created. In 1997, James Cameron donated money to establish a charitable prize in Murdoch's name. In April 2012, Premier Exhibitions announced that it had identified Murdoch's belongings from a prior expedition to the wreck of the Titanic in 2000. There was a toiletry kit, a spare White Star Line officer's button, a straight razor, a shoe brush, a smoking pipe, and a pair of long johns. The items were recovered by David Concannon, Ralph White and Anatoly Sagalevitch diving in the Russian submersible Mir 1 in July 2000.

The New York University Tisch School of the Arts (commonly referred to as Tisch) is the performing, cinematic and media arts school of New York University, and is among the most competitive film schools in the world to enroll in. With many famous alumni having gone to work in the American film industry, Broadway theatre, and in entertainment industries around the world, Tisch is typically ranked among the top American film schools, as such with yearly consistency in notable industry publications such as THR and Variety, and is often considered as one of the top film and theater schools in the United States and the world. Founded on August 17, 1965, Tisch is a training ground for artists, scholars of the arts, and filmmakers; the school merges the technical training of a professional school with the academic resources of a major research university to immerse students in their intended artistic disciplines. The school is divided into three Institutes: Performing Arts, Emerging Media, and Film & Television. Many undergraduate and graduate disciplines are available for students, including: acting, dance, drama, performance studies, design for stage and film, musical theatre writing, photography record producing, game design and development, and film and television studies. The school also offers an inter-disciplinary \\"collaborative arts\\" program, high school programs, continuing education in the arts for the general public, as well as the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, which teaches entrepreneurial strategies in the music recording industry. A dual MFA/MBA graduate program is also offered, allowing students to take coursework at both Tisch and NYU's Stern School of Business. It is located at 721 Broadway (the intersection of Broadway St. and Waverly Place), adjacent to the University's Department of Philosophy building and the Gallatin School of Individualized Study, in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of Lower Manhattan, New York City. In 2013, NYU opened a new technology hub on its Brooklyn campus called the Media and Games Network (MAGNET). Located at 2 MetroTech Center and, beginning in 2019, 370 Jay Street, MAGNET houses three Tisch programs: the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, the Interactive Telecommunications/Interactive Media Arts programs (ITP & IMA), and the Game Center; these programs work in collaboration with departments in media technology from NYU's Tandon School of Engineering and Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. As of 2019, 22 Academy Award winners, 17 Emmy Award winners, 12 Tony Award winners, and 4 Grammy Award winners have been affiliated with Tisch alumni and faculty. , the school had more than 25,000 alumni working in the arts and related professions, and has more alumni in Broadway theatre than any other school for theater in the United States. Also in 2017 alone, six members of the Tisch alumni community were nominated for an Oscar. Over the past 10 Student Academy Award ceremonies, it is one of only two US schools to have double-digit wins. History The Tisch School of the Arts was founded in order to provide conservatory training in theater and film in the context of a research university. The school created additional departments such as dance, theatre design, and cinema studies within a few years. Following the creation of the undergraduate Department of Drama in 1974, the school expanded into other artistic forms, including the Interactive Telecommunications Program, Department of Dramatic Writing, Department of Performance Studies, Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program, Department of Photography and Imaging, and The Department of Art and Public Policy. In 1985, the school's second dean, David Oppenheim, solicited a donation from Laurence A. and Preston Robert Tisch that made possible the acquisition and renovation of the location at 721 Broadway where most of the school's programs are housed. In recognition of the generosity of the Tisch family, the school was renamed Tisch School of the Arts. Departments and programs Tisch School of the Arts has three institutes and 16 programs and offers the Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor of Arts (BA), Master of Fine Arts (MFA), Master of Arts (MA), Master of Professional Studies (MPS), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees. Tisch also offers a selection of classes to NYU students not enrolled in any of its programs through the Open Arts curriculum. The three institutes are: * The Institute of Performing Arts, including the Art & Public Policy, Dance, Design for Stage & Film, Drama, Graduate Acting, Graduate Musical Theatre Writing, Open Arts, and Performance Studies * The Maurice Kanbar Institute of Film & Television, including Cinema Studies and its flagship Moving Image Archiving and Preservation (MIAP) program founded by Howard Besser, the Goldberg Department of Dramatic Writing, Graduate Film, and Undergraduate Film & Television * The Institute of Emerging Media, including the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music, ITP/IMA, Photography & Imaging, and NYU Game Center The school also offers an inter-disciplinary \\"collaborative arts\\" program, as well as the Clive Davis School Institute of Recorded Music (founded by Sony Music CEO Clive Davis), one of the few programs in the US to combine musical arts and business strategies in the recording industry. A dual MFA/MBA graduate program is also offered, allowing students to take coursework at both Tisch and NYU's Stern School of Business. It also offers high school programs (the \\"Tisch Summer High School Program\\" and \\"Spring Future Artists Programs\\") as an outgrowth of the undergraduate classes, and professional courses for the general public as part of a commitment to continuing education in the arts. Tisch School of the Arts, Asia NYU's first branch campus abroad was the result of a partnership with Singapore Government agencies under Singapore's Global Schoolhouse program. Tisch Asia was also Singapore's first graduate arts school and offered Master of Fine Arts degrees in animation and digital arts, dramatic writing, film, and international media producing. Summer programs included professional workshops and non-credit certificate courses. The campus opened in fall 2007 on the former Ministry of Education & Republic Polytechnic grounds at 3 Kay Siang Road, Singapore, with the intention to enroll approximately 250 students. The anticipated enrollment figures were not achieved, financial irregularities were alleged and Tisch Asia President Pari Sara Shirazi was dismissed from her post by NYU in November 2011. In a letter to the Tisch Asia community dated 8 November 2012, Dean Mary Schmidt Campbell announced that the campus would close after 2014 with recruitment and admission of new students suspended with immediate effect. While celebrating the creative and academic achievements at the Singapore campus, she cited financial challenges as the reason for the closure decision. Schmidt-Campbell pledged that NYU would honour commitments to existing students and staff. The letter quoted support from Singapore's Economic Development Board stating that it remained open to future collaboration with NYU. Subsequent reporting has begun to reveal details of the complex negotiations around the closure.  Controversies  During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, which forced NYU to move academic instruction online, many Tisch students demanded a tuition refund, believing that virtual classes did not adequately meet their academic needs as a school for performing, cinematic, and media arts. Instead of addressing the situation directly, the school's dean sent students a video of herself dancing to R.E.M.'s 'Losing My Religion,' intended to raise community spirit and demonstrate that certain types of performing arts instruction were possible through online classes. The dean has since responded by clarifying that she has no control over tuition and that it was \\"challenging\\" for the school to give students their money back at the time.

She was a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1995 until 2018. She represented the riding of York‚ÄîSimcoe. Background Julia Ann Louise Campbell was born in Hamilton, Ontario and raised in Toronto, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto. She taught history in secondary school in Markham and Newmarket for 24 years. She served as a department head in one of the high schools of the York Region Board of Education. She and her husband lived on a farm near Sutton where they bred poodles, borzois and pointers. From 1992 to 1994, she was the president of the Durham‚ÄîYork Progressive Conservative Association. Politics Munro was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election, defeating incumbent New Democrat Larry O'Connor in the former Durham‚ÄîYork riding. She was re-elected in the redistributed riding of York North in the 1999 election. The Tories lost the 2003 general election, but Munro was able to retain her seat by a reduced margin. She was re-elected in 2007, 2011 and again in 2014, albeit by her narrowest margin, in the riding of York-Simcoe. Munro was parliamentary assistant to the premier from 1995 to 1998 in charge of promoting volunteerism and government whip from 1999 to 2001. In 2002, Munro introduced a private member's bill to clamp down on puppy mills. Earlier, the government defeated a similar bill introduced by Liberal Mike Colle that would have licensed dog breeders and given SPCA officials the right to inspect breeding operations. Munro's bill introduced standards of care for dog breeding operations but did not call for licences or inspection rights. Critics alleged that Munro was in a conflict of interest when she introduced weaker legislation since she was a dog breeder herself. Colle said, \\"you don't need a licence to be a breeder, you don't get inspected. Anyone can claim to be a breeder and you don't need any qualifications.\\" The bill was eventually passed. She was the party's critic for the new Ontario Pension Plan, and in 2014 she was Deputy Opposition House Leader. In January 2017, she became the longest-serving female MPP in Ontario's history. On March 21, 2017, Munro announced she would not run for her seat again in the 2018 Ontario provincial election after 22 years in the Legislature. Personal life Munro was married to John and lived in Georgina with their daughter. She taught Barenaked Ladies drummer Tyler Stewart at Huron Heights Secondary School.

Krug was promoted to director of the Office of War Utilities in 1943. In April 1944, Krug enlisted in the United States Navy. He was recalled that August to serve as chairman of the War Production Board, where he served until the board's dissolution in November 1945. =Secretary of the Interior= President Truman nominated Krug for the position of Secretary of the Interior on February 26, and he assumed office on March 18, 1946. As Secretary, Krug opposed lumber companies' efforts to gain logging rights to huge forests in Washington state, and opposed the building of unnecessary dams. As the administrator of coal mines in the United States, he led failed negotiations between John L. Lewis and mine owners in an attempt to end a nationwide strike by the United Mine Workers of America. In August, 1949, Krug chaired the 19-member United States Citizens Committee that participated in the United Nations Scientific Conference on Conservation and Utilization of Resources, held at Lake Success, New York. Other members of the committee included Herbert Hoover, Thomas Watson, Howard E. Babcock, and Randolph Greene Pack.New York Times.

Events prior to murder Bobby Kent, the son of Iranian immigrants Fred and Farah Kent (n√©e Khayam), attended South Broward High School in Hollywood, Florida.Schutze, p. 36 According to Tim Donnelly, who prosecuted all the conspirators for this murder, one attorney described Kent as \\"very Eddie Haskell-like. Adults saw him one way (polite and charming) while the kids saw him in a completely different way.\\" Marty Puccio is an Italian-American, and was raised Roman Catholic.Schutze, p. 24 Kent and Puccio had known each other since third grade, had lived on the same block in Hollywood in Broward County since that time, and were good friends as teenagers. Bad blood, however, existed between the two. Puccio felt \\"ill-will and hatred\\" towards Kent, who would bully and pummel him. Both sets of parents were wary of the friendship as well. Puccio's parents, Martin Sr. and Veronica, were concerned because Marty often returned from being with Kent bleeding or covered in bruises. Fred Kent thought of Puccio as a wayward slacker who had no future (Puccio was a high school dropout) and felt the friendship with his son would destroy the future he was helping him build. Frequent gym-goers, both boys were rumored to use steroids, which, in Kent's case, according to testimonial accounts, significantly contributed to his erratic, aggressive behavior. Kent and Puccio had experimented with making gay porn movies, hoping to distribute them to local shops. Neither Kent nor Puccio actually participated in these movies, but, rather, allegedly directed them and coaxed a Florida man in his 40s to perform on camera. Kent tried to peddle a movie, titled Rough Boys, to porn shops across South Florida. None took him up on the offer, due to the poor audio and video quality as well as the lack of any sexual activities in the film beyond the man dancing nude and playing with a dildo.Schutze, pp. 52‚Äì58, 61‚Äì62, 77, 104 Murder Toward the beginning of 1993, Puccio (aged 20) began dating Lisa Connelly (aged 18). Frustrated by how much time Puccio spent with Kent (aged 20) as well as Kent's treatment of Puccio, Connelly tried to distract Kent from Puccio by setting up her friend Alice \\"Ali\\" Willis (aged 17) with Kent.Schutze, p. 72-74 Kent and Willis dated for a few weeks, but she ultimately ended the relationship because he was abusive.Schutze, p. 75-76 In June, Puccio confided to Connelly that Kent had been abusive to him quite often over the years. Connelly tried to convince him to end the friendship, but Puccio seemed hesitant. By this time, Connelly knew she was pregnant with Puccio's child, and was determined to pursue a permanent relationship with him.Schutze, p. 87 Allegedly, Connelly decided that Kent needed to be eliminated permanently, and began talking to Puccio and other friends about murdering him.Schutze, , events detailed in chapter 4. On July 13, 1993, Connelly called Willis and told her that \\"Bobby Kent was planning to come to Palm Bay [where Willis was living] to murder her and smother her baby [by a previous relationship], unless she returned to Broward County to date him again.\\" Willis claimed Connelly asked her to come to Connelly's house to discuss murdering Bobby Kent. Willis went to Connelly's house and brought two friends, her current boyfriend, Donald Semenec (aged 17), and Heather Swallers (aged 18).Schutze, pp. 98-100 On the night of July 13, 1993, Puccio, Semenec, Swallers, Connelly and Willis met with Kent. Puccio, Semenec, and Swallers became uncomfortable and left. Connelly and Willis lured Kent to a new development under construction with the promise that he would be able to drive Willis' Mustang 5.0 and have sex with her.Schutze, pp. 106-107 Connelly had brought along her mother's pistol, intending to kill Kent while he was distracted by sexual activity with Willis, but was unable to go through with shooting him.Schutze, pp. 108-110 Despite the failed attempt, Connelly still wanted Kent dead. Seeking assistance, she contacted a self-proclaimed \\"hit man\\" named Derek Kaufman (aged 20), who had been recommended by a friend of Willis'. The group met Kaufman at his home in Rolling Oaks.Schutze, pp. 111-113 They wanted him to get a gun so they could kill Kent that night, but Kaufman told them he couldn't procure a weapon that quickly. Willis, Connelly, Semenec and Swallers then went back to Connelly's house and were joined by her cousin, Derek Dzvirko (aged 19).Schutze, p. 125 The group continued to discuss their plans, and ultimately decided to go ahead with murdering Kent the next night, with Kaufman's assistance.Schutze, pp.136-145 Late on the night of July 14, 1993, the seven joined together at Puccio's house and finalized their plans. Puccio contacted Kent and convinced him to come out with the group that night, with the promise that they would race their cars and that Willis wanted to have sex with him again.Schutze, p. 132 The group assembled their weapons: between them, they had two knives, a lead pipe, and a baseball bat. Around 11:30 p.m., they picked Kent up from his home and headed out to a construction site. When they arrived at the site, Willis, in accordance with the plan, took Kent off to a secluded spot where they were talking. Swallers joined them there. While she and Willis distracted Kent,Schutze, pp. 148-150 Semenec came up and stabbed Kent in the neck with a knife, which was the first blow. When Kent asked for Puccio's help, Puccio stuck a knife in Kent‚Äôs stomach. Kent yelled out an apology,The text of the apology differs depending on the source: * Witt, April and Scott Wigham. \\"What is Happening to Our Children? \\" The Miami Herald. October 24, 1993.

Please, whatever it is, I'm sorry, Marty, I'm sorry!\\" but Puccio continued to stab him.Schutze, , p. 151. When Kent tried to flee, Puccio, Semenec, and Derek Kaufman followed him and continued wounding him. Puccio then slit Kent's throat and hit his head against the ground.Schutze, p. 152 Kaufman then approached and hit Kent in the head with the baseball bat, which was the final blow.Schutze, p. 154 After this, Dzvirko, Semenec, Puccio, and Kaufman helped dump Kent's body on the edge of the shore of the marsh, in the belief that alligators would eat the decaying body.Schutze, Illustrations  Aftermath  In the days following the crime, many of the conspirators confessed to various other people.Schutze, , events detailed in chapter 7. Connelly confessed to her mother, who contacted her sister, Dzvirko's mother. Together, they took Connelly and Dzvirko to see their brother, Joe Scrima, who had friends in the police department and who they thought would know what to do.Schutze, p. 216 Scrima's friends put them in touch with Detective Frank Illaraza of the Broward County Sheriff's Office, and a cooperative Dzvirko confessed everything.Schutze, p. 217. As proof, he led Illaraza to Kent's body.Schutze, pp. 218-220 Adjudications *Martin Puccio was charged with first-degree murder and was originally sentenced to death by electrocution on August 3, 1995.\\"Puccio, Martin.\\" Florida Department of Corrections.

In popular culture The murder resulted in a best-selling true crime book in 1998, Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge (), written by Jim Schutze. The book was adapted by David McKenna (credited under the pseudonym \\"Zachary Long\\" after he demanded his name be removed from the film) and Roger Pullis into the 2001 film Bully, directed by Larry Clark. In the film, Kent was portrayed by Nick Stahl, Puccio was portrayed by Brad Renfro, Willis was portrayed by Bijou Phillips, Connelly was portrayed by Rachel Miner, Semenec was portrayed by Michael Pitt, Swallers was portrayed by Kelli Garner, Dzvirko was portrayed by Daniel Franzese, and Kaufman was portrayed by Leo Fitzpatrick. The story was also covered during an episode of the A&E; series American Justice as well as Forensic Files, and, more recently, Investigation Discovery's Murder Among Friends.

A chorale is a simple melody, often based on Gregorian chant, written for congregations to sing hymns. Chorale settings can be vocal, instrumental, or both. Although the bulk of them are German in origin, and predominantly baroque in style, chorale settings span many countries and musical periods. At their simplest and most common, chorale settings are plain chordal harmonisations with little or no localised ornamentation‚Äîtypically one chord for each note of the chorale, although quicker passing and neighbour notes are almost never harmonised with a separate chord. The Protestant Reformation resulted in a significant change in musical practice in northern Europe. Plainchant, associated with the Catholic Church, was largely replaced with choral music sung in the vernacular language‚Äîusually German‚Äîand the corresponding musical forms from Catholic countries, such as the motet, were replaced with forms that used as their basis the chorales instead of the plainsong from which much of the motet repertory was derived. Not only the musical forms, but the individual tunes of the Catholic Church were replaced by reformers, although there was often a close relation between the original and the replacement. Composers, including Martin Luther himself, both composed new tunes for the German chorale texts and adapted specific plainchant melodies. These chorales were set musically in an extraordinary number of ways, from the time of the Protestant Reformation to the present day. Chorale settings are of the following principal types: * Chorale cantata * Chorale canzona (usually called a Chorale ricercare) * Chorale concerto * Chorale fantasia * Chorale fugue * Chorale mass * Chorale monody * Chorale motet * Chorale partita (usually interchangeable with chorale variations) * Chorale prelude * Chorale ricercare * Chorale variations (usually interchangeable with chorale partita) Boundaries between different items on this list can be vague, especially in the early Baroque. Some of these forms are exclusively instrumental (such as the chorale prelude, chorale fugue, chorale fantasia, chorale partita or variations, and chorale ricercare/canzona) while the others are a cappella vocal (some chorale motets) or for voices and instruments (chorale cantata, chorale concerto, chorale mass, chorale monody, some chorale motets). Many of the instrumental forms are almost exclusively for organ, the single most important liturgical instrument in Protestant church music from the Reformation until recent times. These organ settings can be called organ chorales. Some of these forms continue to be used by composers up to the present day, particularly the chorale prelude and the chorale mass.

(1923) Silent comedy is a style of film, related to but distinct from mime, invented to bring comedy into the medium of film in the silent film era (1900s-1920s) before a synchronized soundtrack which could include talking was technologically available for the majority of films. Silent comedy is still practiced, albeit much less frequently, and it has influenced comedy in modern media as well. Many of the techniques of silent comedy were borrowed from vaudeville traditions with many silent comedies such as Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin getting their start in vaudeville. Silent comedies often place heavy emphasis on visual and physical humors, often including \\"sight gags\\", to tell stories and entertain the viewer. Many of these physical gags are exaggerated forms of violence which came to be called \\"slapstick\\". The \\"prat fall\\", slipping on a banana peel, getting soaked with water, and getting a pie thrown in one's face are all classic examples of slapstick comedy devices. Silent film era =Beginnings‚Äì1913= The first silent comedy film is generally regarded as L'Arroseur Arros√©, directed and produced by Louis Lumi√®re. Shown to the public on June 10, 1895, it ran for 49 seconds and consisted of a gardener being sprayed in the face with a hose. Most likely based on a popular comic strip of the time, L'Arroseur Arros√© created a new genre and inspired its audiences. As film shifted from a novelty medium that set out to capture exotic places and everyday actions to an established industry in the early 1900s, films began to tell fabricated stories that were written and shot in a studio. Before 1902, these usually consisted of films that were no longer than a couple of minutes in length and consisted of one shot. By 1902, filmmakers like George Melies began producing films that were closer to one reel in length of film (about 10 minutes running time) and utilized multiple shots. During this time period comedy became a genre of its own. The first international silent comedian star came was the French Max Linder who worked for the Path√© Film Company. His character, a mustached, top hat wearing, high class man, excelled in taking simple scenarios and everyday tasks and wreaking havoc. His style of comedy was imitated numerous silent comedians that followed him. Intertitles almost always served the purpose of introducing characters and setting. Intertitles also often conveyed dialogue. Occasionally these intertitles included illustrations, but most often they were black with white text. Conversation could also be shown using body language and mouthing. Color silent films are quite rare, as inexpensive color film was not invented until the late 1930s; the vast majority of silent comedies are in black and white. Seven Chances is an exception, with opening scenes filmed in early Technicolor. =1913‚Äì1927= Mack Sennett and Hal Roach were two of the most famous producers of silent comedies. Famous actors and teams from this era are now legendary: Ben Turpin, Keystone Cops, Mabel Normand, Edna Purviance, Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle, Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Larry Semon, Harry Langdon, Charley Chase, Stan Laurel (who made a commercially successful transition into talking pictures in the team Laurel & Hardy), along with many others. Modern era In the early years of \\"talkie\\" films (beginning in 1927, see The Jazz Singer) a few actors continued to act silently for comedic effect, most famously Charlie Chaplin, whose last great \\"silent\\" comedies City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) were both made in the sound age. Another late example was Harpo Marx, who always played a mute in the Marx Brothers' films. Another important legacy of silent film comedy was the humor in animated cartoons. Even as live-action comedy moved towards a focus on the verbal humor of Abbott and Costello and Groucho Marx, animated cartoons took up the entire range of slapstick gags, frenetic chase scenes, visual puns, and exaggerated facial expressions previously seen in silent comedies. These devices were most pronounced in the Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies cartoons from Warner Bros. directed by Bob Clampett, Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng and in the MGM Cartoons of Tex Avery, the Tom and Jerry cartoons of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, and of Harman and Ising. An early television series that featured exaggerated visual humor was the Ernie Kovacs program. During the 1960s and 1970s, several films made homages or references to the silent era of film comedy. It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World performers and gags form the era and Blake Edwards' The Great Race and Mel Brooks' Silent Movie were full-length tributes. Peter Bogdanovich's What's Up, Doc? also featured slapstick gags and Keystone-style chase scenes, ideas that prefigured much of the humor in The Blues Brothers and Airplane! later in the decade. An episode of The Brady Bunch featured the family making a silent comedy filled with pie-throwing. Few feature films today exploit the genre of silent comedy. Occasionally, comedy teams will use a silent character for comedic effect. The most consistent‚Äîand also the most famous‚Äîis Teller from Penn & Teller. Rowan Atkinson had huge success in the 1990s with the character Mr. Bean. In a 1999 episode of Frasier, \\"Three Valentines\\", David Hyde Pierce, who played Niles Crane, performed a silent 5 minute sketch at the start of the episode. Shaun the Sheep is a British stop motion animated children's television series which also uses silent comedy. However, techniques employed by silent comedy, continue to influence talkie comedies, mainly through silent comedy's development of the older art of slapstick and through artistic reference to the trademark gags of famous silent comedians. In 2010, India's first silent comedy series, Gutur Gu (2010) started SAB TV, and became a hit.

In the American Civil War, he took part in the liberation of New Orleans and the lower Mississippi. Later he was sent to the Far East to command the East India Squadron. In summer 1867, he led a punitive expedition to avenge the Rover incident, where American sailors had been killed by Taiwanese aborigines. In January of the next year, while trying to force the Japanese to accept trade concessions, he drowned when his boat overturned in bad weather. Biography Bell was born in Orange County, North Carolina. Appointed a Midshipman on 4 August 1823, during the next two decades he served afloat in U.S. Atlantic waters, the Mediterranean Sea and the West Indies as an officer of the frigates and ; the sloops of war , , and ; and the schooner . In March 1831, while in Vincennes, Bell was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant. He was assigned to special service on a vessel named Hunter (apparently not part of the U.S. Navy) during the mid-1840s, then was off Africa and in the Mediterranean as an officer of the frigate United States and as commanding officer of the schooner . Between early 1849 and mid-1855, Bell served ashore at the Philadelphia, Norfolk and New York Navy Yards. Promoted to the rank of Commander in August 1854, Bell went to the East Indies in 1855-1858 as commanding officer of the steamer . He spent the late 1850s and early 1860s as a member of the Board of Examiners at the U.S. Naval Academy and on ordnance duty at both Cold Spring, New York and the Washington Navy Yard. During the Civil War he served as Fleet Captain of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron under Admiral David Farragut. He served in the series of campaigns that captured New Orleans and gradually opened the Mississippi River for exploitation by Federal forces. In July 1862, while so-engaged, he attained the rank of Commodore. After completing his Gulf assignment in 1864, he was assigned to the New York Navy Yard as Inspector of Ordnance. With the Civil War at an end, in July 1865 Commodore Bell was sent to the Far East to command the East India (later Asiatic) Squadron. He was advanced to Rear Admiral a year later and placed on the Retired List in April 1867, but remained active as the Asiatic Squadron's commander. Death In summer 1867, Rear Admiral Bell led the Formosan Expedition, a punitive operation in response to the Rover incident, where American sailors had been killed by Taiwanese aborigines. His squadron including screw sloops of war, (flagship), , and , with warships of other western countries, anchored in Osaka Bay to increase pressure on the Japanese government to open Hy≈çgo Port on 1 January 1868 as committed by various unequal treaties. On 11 January 1868, having passed Temp≈çzan en route upriver, his boat overturned in heavy seas; Bell and all but three of the craft's other occupants perished in this accident.

As a freshman, Lisi recorded three goals and six assists, despite starting only four games for the Tigers. As a sophomore, he was named second-team All-American and first-team All-ACC, after scoring 10 goals and 17 assists for the team. His junior season was not as impressive, as he finished with only 5 goals and 6 assists, but he was named first-team All-ACC nevertheless. In his senior season, he scored 14 goals and 8 assists, and was named a first-team All-American. He finished his career at Clemson with 33 goals and 37 assists. Upon graduating, Lisi was selected third overall in the 2001 MLS SuperDraft by D.C. United. He immediately earned a starting role with a mediocre D.C. team, and finished the year with four goals and five assists in 25 games.

Biography Stribling was born at Pendleton, South Carolina, and left home at the age of 15. He was appointed midshipman on 18 June 1812, the day the United States declared war on Great Britain. During the War of 1812, he served in from 1 January 1813 to April 1814 and in from then until April 1815. While assigned to Mohawk on Lake Ontario, Stribling participated in the blockade of Kingston in the summer and fall of 1814. Soon after the end of the war, he returned to Macedonian and, in 1815, participated in the capture of two Algerine ships, a frigate and a brig, by Commodore Stephen Decatur's squadron. In October 1815, Stribling was transferred to and returned home in that frigate at the end of 1817. On 1 April 1818, he was promoted to lieutenant and served successively in , , and , and again in Constellation, during the campaigns against pirates in the West Indies. In 1823, he was given command of two barges along the coast of Cuba and with them captured buccaneer schooner Pilot after a running fight. In 1835, he commanded the re-commissioned Peacock (1828) on her second diplomatic mission conveying diplomatist Edmund Roberts, accompanied by Lieutenant Commanding A. S. Campbell the U. S. Schooner Enterprise, both under the command of Commodore Edmund P. Kennedy, on the Commodore's way to establish the East India Squadron. During the Mexican War, Stribling was attached to the ship-of-the- line and took part in operations against the coastal towns of Lower California and western Mexico. From 1851 to 1853, he served as Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy. On 1 August 1853, he was promoted to the rank of captain. From 1854 to 1855, he commanded and, between 1857 and 1859, he was Commandant at the Pensacola Navy Yard. After two years as Commander of the East India Squadron, Stribling returned home in 1861 to find the Union rent asunder by the Civil War. He supported the Union cause. Under the provisions of the Act of Congress, effective 21 December 1861, his long service required that he be placed upon the retired list. That action and a promotion to the rank of commodore took place on 2 August 1862. The exigencies of war soon brought him back to active duty. He commanded the Philadelphia Navy Yard until 23 September 1864, when he was ordered to assume command of the East Gulf Blockading Squadron. He held this post for the duration of the war. On 6 August 1866, he was appointed to the Lighthouse Board and remained with that organization until 18 September 1871, having served as president of the board from 15 March 1869. Rear Admiral Stribling died at Martinsburg, West Virginia, on 17 January 1880.

He studied with Karlheinz Stockhausen and Mauricio Kagel in Cologne in the 1970s and later became associated with the Neue Einfacheit (New Simplicity) movement in the city . In the late 1970s he became interested in the indigenous music of his homeland and began a series of pieces which attempted to combine aspects of African and contemporary European music . Although Volans later moved away from any direct engagement with African music, certain residual elements such as interlocking rhythms, repetition and open forms are still detectable in his music since the early 1990s which takes a new direction more redolent of certain schools of abstract art. He settled in Ireland permanently in 1986 and was granted Irish citizenship in 1995.  Biography  During his teenage years Volans developed an interest in the music of the post-war avant garde as well as abstract painting. He pursued a Bachelor of Music degree at the University of the Witwatersrand graduating in 1972 After postgraduate study at the University of Aberdeen he moved in 1973 to Cologne, where he became one of only five students admitted to Stockhausen's composition class at the Musikhochschule. He became intimately acquainted with Stockhausen's extensions of serial technique and eventually became his teaching assistant in 1975‚Äì76, replacing Richard Toop. He also took lessons in music theatre from Mauricio Kagel as well as taking piano lessons from Aloys Kontarsky and studying electronic music with Hans-Ulrich Humpert . While in Cologne Volans became increasingly dissatisfied with the new-music movement in the city, which he perceived to be dogmatic and creatively restricting . Alongside other composers such as Walter Zimmermann, Gerald Barry, and Michael von Biel, Volans began to question the hegemony of the prevailing new-music style that was based on an extension of the serial techniques of the previous generation . This group of composers, loosely referred to as the Cologne School, marked the start of the Neue Einfachheit (New Simplicity) movement which began with a concert series organised by Zimmermann in January 1977 . Composers linked with the New Simplicity generally sought a more transparent and direct style, an openness to aspects of tonality and a freedom to use pre-existing material quite in contrast to the intense abstraction of the post-war avant garde .  Africa series  Despite having grown up in South Africa, Volans had little contact with the indigenous music of his homeland due to apartheid strictures which largely prohibited the intermingling of black and white cultures . It wasn't until he was commissioned by Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) to undertake a number of field trips between 1976 and 1979 to South Africa to record various kinds of indigenous African music that he began to actively take an interest in this music . These field trips alerted him to aspects of indigenous African culture, both musical and visual, which he had previously overlooked . He thus set about planning a series of works in which he attempted to reconcile African and European aesthetics . At the start of the series Volans envisaged that the African source material would be quite recognizable but as the series progressed he would gradually exercise more and more intervention into it so that by the end of the series the African material would be fully assimilated into his own style: As a political statement, Volans, as a white South African, felt that the series might lend some sort of contribution to the struggle against apartheid and some performances were met with protests from the musical establishment in South Africa . The most well-known piece from the series is White Man Sleeps (1982) for two harpsichords, viola da gamba and percussion. In this piece Volans attempted to \\"Africanize\\" Western European art music by transferring paraphrases and transcriptions of Venda, San, Nyungwe and Lesotho music, as well as his own material, onto re-tuned period instruments . The subsequent reworking of the piece for a recording by the Kronos Quartet became one of the biggest-selling string-quartet releases of all time . The works immediately following White Man Sleeps, such as the second and third quartets, continue to use some African references, but display an increasing preoccupation with non-directional narratives influenced by the uneven and often random patterns present in African textiles, as well as the open approach to time present in the late works of Morton Feldman .  Towards abstraction  Despite the success of the African series, Volans began to find himself increasingly categorized as an \\"African\\" composer‚Äîa label which he found creatively restricting . In the late 1980s he began to pursue a new direction, developing a style characterized by an overall tendency towards increasing abstraction occasionally punctuated by works where literal African elements once again re-emerge . This is clearly seen in works such as Chevron (1990) and One Hundred Frames (1991), as well as his opera The Man with Footsoles of Wind (1993) based on the last year of the life of the 19th- century poet Arthur Rimbaud . A parallel development to this was his increasing interest in writing for dance, an art-form particularly suited to Volans's open conception of formal structure and he has collaborated with the choreographers Jonathan Burrows, Siobhan Davies and Shobana Jeyasingh . The key work which confirmed this new direction is Cicada (1994) for two pianos, which was inspired by his experience inside one of James Turrell's Skyspaces . The piece involves very gradual adjustments of tone, harmonic colour and tempo being applied to a repeated sonority based on a B-flat major and A major triads . Described by the composer as his first minimalist piece, Cicada's reduction in content and largely flat surface is a departure from the generally high degree of activity which marked many of his earlier works . Although there is no recognizably African material present in the piece, the existence of interlocking patterns, inherent rhythms and open non- developmental forms demonstrate how African elements continue to inform his work in a background capacity . In a number of works since Cicada, Volans limited the content and pursued a similar policy of incremental changes at the margins of the material . The reduction of material in these pieces is even more extreme than in Cicada and exemplifies a tendency which Volans has described as follows: Two works in particular demonstrate this tendency ‚Äî String Quartet No. 6 and the Concerto for Double Orchestra. String Quartet No. 6 is not in fact a string quartet at all but a piece for two spatially separated string quartets which can be performed live with both quartets or with one live and the other pre-recorded . The vast majority of the piece consists of just two chords which overlap between both quartets creating a blurring of the harmonies not unlike the blurring of colour fields in the paintings of Mark Rothko, which served as the piece's inspiration . In the Concerto for Double Orchestra (2001) static harmonies are spatially distributed back and forth between a split orchestra with a focus on the \\"edges\\" of the chords through accented pizzicatos and dynamics rather than \\"bleeding\\" them together . Both of these works demonstrate Volans's concerns with moving the site of musical discourse to the margins of the material, a strategy inspired by his lifelong interest in visual art. The music tends to focus on the interplay between dynamics, voicings, register, timbre and types of attack; parameters which are usually considered secondary to larger-scale transformations in the domain of pitch and rhythm. The reduced approach to content directs attention towards changes in the slightest details and encourages a form of engagement perhaps more prevalent in the world of visual art . This tendency towards reduction is not universal, however. Perhaps due to the inherent nature of the medium, Volans's concertante works such as the Trio Concerto (2005) and the Piano Concerto No. 2 (2006) are notable for their virtuosic writing and dynamism . Volans's most recent work constitutes yet another phase of development. Beginning with The Partenheimer Project (2007), much of the new work explores the interaction between individual parts playing independently of each other to some degree. The Partenheimer Project is spatially separated into three ensembles while both Violin: Piano (2008) and Cello: Piano (2008) contain instruments playing at different tempi propelled for the most part by irregular repetition. The transparent scoring and negation of any sense of goal-orientated progression lends the music a static floating quality . While Volans's music has often been viewed as a reaction to the perceived excesses of serialism, it is nevertheless significant that his approach to dynamics and articulation is always structurally rather than expressively directed . In this way, Volans identifies with the tradition of modernism and his music studiously avoids any lapses into postmodern nostalgia . He has been described by the music critic Kyle Gann as: {{QuoteBy refusing to repeat himself or anyone else, Volans remains one of the planet‚Äôs most distinctive and unpredictable voices . In 1997 the BBC Music Magazine listed him as one of the 50 most important living composers. In 1999 the Southbank Centre in London hosted a 50th birthday celebration of his work and for his 60th the Wigmore Hall in London organised a \\"Kevin Volans Day\\" of concerts . The Wigmore Hall is again planning a 2019 celebration for his 70th birthday. Students Volans taught composition at the University of Natal, where he received a DMus in 1986. He was also composer in residence at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast (1986‚Äì89) and at Princeton University (1992) . Since moving to Ireland in 1985 he has exerted a considerable influence on the direction of music in the country through his teaching. His notable students include, Andrew Hamilton, Jennifer Walshe, Simon O'Connor, Deirdre Gribben, Elaine Agnew, Deirdre MacKay, Jonathan Nangle and Juergen Simpson.

This article looks at the onomastics practices of the Jewish people, that is, the history of the origin and forms of proper names. History =Early Biblical Era= The name conferred upon a person in early Biblical times was generally connected with some circumstance of that person's birth‚Äîseveral of Jacob's sons are recorded as having received their names in this manner (Genesis 30). Generally, it was the mother who chose the name, as in the case of Jacob's sons, but there were occasions on which the father chose the child's name, such as in Genesis 16:15, 17:19, and 21:2.https://www.academia.edu/5036794/A_Mother_s_Influence_Mothers_naming_children_in_the_Hebrew_Bible Occasionally, persons other than the parents were the name-givers, as in the cases of Moses (Exodus 2:10) and Solomon (II Samuel 12:25). It appears to have been the custom in early Biblical times to confer a name immediately upon birth, but in later periods a name was given to a boy at circumcision (compare Luke 1:59 to 2:21). Before the Babylonian exile, it was not common practice to name children after their relatives, even in the royal family‚Äînone of the twenty-one kings of Judah was named after a predecessor, or after David, the founder of the dynasty. On the other hand, a son of Jonathan and of King Saul were each named Meribaal (II Samuel 21:7 and following). Instead of repeating the exact name of an ancestor, however, it was customary to make use of one of the elements of the family name. Thus, Ahitub has two sons, Ahijah and Ahimelech. Three of Saul's family members have the element ba'al (in the altered form bosheth) in their names. As a consequence of this avoidance of repetition, a single name was as a rule sufficient to identify a person. It became traditional to identify a son by his father's name and a chosen name, like Jaazaniah ben Shaphan (Ezekiel 8:11) only in later years of Hebrew history. Significance It is probable that, as in other ancient societies, a name carried spiritual significance.Frazer, \\"Golden Bough\\", 2d ed., i. 404 et seq. A large majority of the 2,800 personal names found in the Hebrew Bible (shared among about 15,000 persons) convey a specific meaning. The meanings of the remainder have been obscured either through textual corruption or insufficient current understanding of comparative philology. In addition, a considerable number of these names are probably eponyms. There is little doubt that this applies to the names of the Israelite clans, each of which was assumed to be descended from the descendants of Jacob, described in Numbers 26. Names may be derived from the order of birth, as in the cases of Akkub and Jacob, whose names probably mean \\"posthumous.\\" Jephthah implies \\"first-born\\", as does Becher, while names like Manasseh, Nahum, and Nehemiah refer probably to children who have come to take the place of others that have died in childhood. The idea of relationship is expressed in Ahab, probably originally Ahiab (Jeremiah 29:21). Personal peculiarities may give rise to a name, as Laban (\\"white\\", or \\"blond\\"), Gideon (\\"maimed\\"), or Harim (\\"with pierced nose\\"). Personality may be referred to, as in the names Job (\\"assailant\\") and Barak (\\"lightning\\"). There are no occupational names in the Bible corresponding to Anglo-Saxon names like Smith of England or M√ºller of Germany, but names taken from objects are found, especially among females. The name Rebecca (Rivka) seems to be derived from a sheep-rope, Peninnah from pearl, and Keren-happuch from a box of face-paint. Abstract names seem to have been given primarily to women, such as Manoah (\\"rest\\") and Michal (\\"power\\"). Jacobs gives eighty-four names (applied to 120 different persons) derived from animals and plants.\\"Studies in Biblical Archeology\\", pp. 94‚Äì100 Leah is generally known as a word for cow, and Rachel for ewe (appropriate since both are considered matriarchs). Oreb (\\"raven\\") and Ze'ev (\\"wolf\\") were princes of the Midianites (although Ze'ev was also an appellation of Benjamin), and Caleb (\\"the dog\\") was the founder of the chief Judean tribe. Achbor (\\"mouse\\") and Shaphan (\\"coney\\") also occur. Jonah is the equivalent of \\"dove\\", Zipporah of \\"bird\\", and Deborah of \\"bee.\\" Esther's Jewish name, Hadassah, means \\"myrtle.\\" Citing these animal-inspired names, Robertson Smith and others have attempted to find evidence of totemism among the ancient Hebrews. Other Jewish names taken from animals include Ari (lion), Ariel means (\\"God is my lion\\"), Dov (bear), and Tzvi or Zvi (deer). Compound names A distinctive characteristic of Bible onomastics is the frequency of composite names, which form at times even complete sentences, as in the case of Isaiah's son Shear- jashub (\\"the remnant shall return\\") and Hephzibah (\\"my pleasure is in her\\"). Sometimes these composites have a preposition as their first element, as Bishlam (= \\"with peace\\"; Ezra 4:7) and Lemuel (\\"belonging to God\\"; Proverbs 31:4); but in the majority of cases these composite names are theophorous, referring to, or actually mentioning, the Deity, either by the name of YHWH or by the name of El. The specific name of the Hebrew God appears at the beginning as Jo- and at the end as -iah; thus, Jonathan is a doublet of Elnathan, and Joezer (\\"YHWH is help\\") is the same as Joazar (\\"YHWH has helped\\"). A whole theology may be deduced from the large number of Biblical names referring to acts, actions, and attributes of the deity; thus: YHWH \\"gives\\" (Elnathan, Jonathan, Nathaniel); \\"increases the family\\" (Eliasaph, Joseph); \\"is gracious\\" (Elhanan, Hananeel, John, Hananiah); \\"has mercy\\" (Jerahmeel); \\"blesses\\" (Barachel, Berechiah); \\"loves\\" (Jedidiah, Eldad); \\"helps\\" (Eleazar, Azareel, Azariah); \\"benefits\\" (Gamaliel); \\"holds fast\\" (Jehoahaz, Ahaziah); \\"is strong\\" (Uzziel, Azaziah, Uzziah); \\"delivers\\" (Elpalet, Eliphalet); \\"comforts\\" (Nehemiah); \\"heals\\" (Rephael); \\"conceals\\" (Elzaphan, Zephaniah); \\"establishes\\" (Eliakim, Jehoiakim); \\"knows\\" (Eliada, Jehoiada); \\"remembers\\" (Zechariah); \\"sees\\" (Hazael, Jahaziel); \\"hears\\" (Elishama, Hoshama); \\"answers\\" (Anaiah, Ananiah, Janai); \\"speaks\\" (Amariah); \\"is praised\\" (Jehaleel); \\"is asked\\" (Shealtiel); \\"comes\\" (Eliathah); \\"lives\\" (Jehiel); \\"exalts/uplifts\\" (Jeremiah); \\"thunders\\" (Raamiah; Nehemiah 7:7); \\"gladdens\\" (Jahdiel, Jehdeiah); \\"judges\\" (Elishaphat, Jehoshaphat, Shephatiah, Daniel); \\"is just\\" (Jehozadak, Zedekiah); \\"is king\\" (Elimelech, Malchiel); \\"is lord\\" (Bealiah); \\"is great\\" (Gedaliah); \\"is perfect\\" (Jotham); \\"is high\\" (Jehoram); \\"is glorious\\" (Jochebed); \\"is incomparable\\" (Michael, literally \\"who is like God?\\") Besides these distinct names of God other divine names are used, as Adoni in Adoniram, and Melech in Nathan-melech and Ebed-melech, and Baal in Esh-baal (changed for special reasons to Ishbosheth). In some cases names of relationship seem to be used as applied to the Deity (compare Abiel, Abijah, and Abimelech, signifying in each case the fatherhood of God), and in this way Abinadab would correspond to Jehonadab and Abiezer to Eliezer. The same applies to the elements a·∏•- (\\"brother\\") and amm- (\\"uncle\\"). As, however, some of these words are applied to families, not individuals, the whole must be taken as a sentence: Avihud means \\"my father is glorious\\" (referring to God). On the same principle it must be assumed that some verbal names are theophorous, and refer to the action of the Deity, Nathan being the abbreviation of Elnathan (\\"God gives\\"), Shaphat of Jehoshaphat (\\"God judges\\"). Thus Ahaz appears in a form corresponding to Jehoahaz in an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III. Many of the theophorous endings are contracted into -a, -i, or -ai, as in Shebna, Hosa, Talti, and Shemai. A few names are adjectival, and may contain references to the Deity: Baruch (\\"blessed\\"), David (\\"beloved\\"), Amos (\\"strong\\"). Some names have grammatical endings which it is difficult to interpret, as -oth in Shelomoth; the final -i in Omri and Barzilai probably refers to a tribal origin. Many names ending in -on are animal-names, as Ephron (\\"small deer\\"), Nahshon (\\"small serpent\\"); compare Samson (\\"small sun\\"). =Post-Exilic names= After the Exile to Babylon there appeared a tendency toward the use of foreign names, the literal significance of which was disregarded, and this tendency became more and more prominent as time went on. Biblical names ending in -a (as in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah) are Aramaic. Shamsherai (I Chronicles 8:26), while Mordecai is probably derived from Marduk, or may be derived from \\"pure myrrh\\"), as are Belteshazzar (Daniel 10:1), Shenazar (I Chronicles 3:18), and Sheshbazzar (Ezra 1:8) from other deities. There is in this period a tendency also toward descriptive and adjectival names with the definite article prefixed, which easily gave rise to such surnames as Hakkaz, Hakkatan, and Hallosheth (Ezra 2:61; 8:12; Nehemiah 3:12; compare the form ha-Kohelet (Ecclesiastes 12:8, in the Hebrew). In the Hellenistic period Greek names became quite usual among the Jews, especially those of Alexander, Jason, and Antigonus. Even the name of a god like Apollo occurs (Acts 18:24). Other names are Apollonius, Hyrcanus, Lysimachus, Demetrius, Dosa, Nicanor, Pappus, Patroclus, Philo, Sosa, Symmachus, Tryphon, Zeno. The same occurs among women, as Alexandra and Priscilla. Roman names also occur, as Antonius, Apella, Drusus, Justinus, Justus, Marcus, Rufus, Tiberius, and Titus. It was during this period that the practice arose of giving a son the name of his grandfather, as was done in the high-priestly family, the members of which were named alternately Onias and Simon from 332 to 165 BCE. Similarly, a little later, in the family of the Hillelites, the names Gamaliel and Judah succeed each other with only an occasional occurrence of Simon and Hillel. Toward the end of the period, owing to the intermixture of foreign languages, the use of double names for the same person began to be adopted, as in the instances of Simon Peter, John Mark, Thomas Didymus, Herodes Agrippa, and Salome Alexandra. =Talmudic period= Among the names in the Talmud there is a considerable proportion of Greek ones. A large number also are Aramaic, ending in -a or -ai: Abba, Huna, and Papa are instances of the former. Even Bible names were transformed in this direction‚Äî‚Äî·∏§anina instead of Hananiah, Abuya instead of Abijah; while others were shortened, as Lazar (for Eleazar). Many Biblical names received renewed popularity owing to the distinction of their bearers, as those of Gamaliel, Hillel, and Ulla. The tendency toward double names existed here, as Sarah Miriam, Johanan Joseph,Gi·π≠. 34b and Mahaliel Judah.Yoma 52b Converts to Judaism, like Aquila, Monabaz, and Helena, retained their pagan names (as was the custom also in the early Christian Church). There was some objection to foreign names among the Jews of this period,Num. R. yet legend declares that the high priest Simon promised Alexander the Great that all the children of priestly families born in the year following his visit to Jerusalem would be named Alexander, after him.Yosippon, folio 87 In the adoption of double names during this early period an attempt was made to translate the Hebrew terms into corresponding Greek, as Ariston for Tobi, Boethus for Ezra, Justus for Zadok, Philo for Jedidah, Theodorus for Nethaneel, and Zosimus for ·∏§ayyim. It was somewhat rare for the same name to be used by both sexes. In Biblical times this occurs with regard to the names Abigail, Abijah, Athaliah, Chushan, Ephah, Micha, Nahash, Shelomith, Zibiah; in Talmudic times, with regard to Ibu, Johanan, Nehorai, Pasi, Shalom; the only later instances that may be cited are Jeroham, Mazal-·π¨ob, Ne·∏•amah, Menu·∏•ah, Sim·∏•ah, Tamar, Bongodas, and Bien-li-Viengue. To wear a man's name seemed as objectionable as wearing men's clothes. It was already noticed in Talmudic times that the use of family names had died out.Gi·π≠. 88a The name of Rabbi Meir was said to be derived from an experience at school which was regarded as being of good omen.Eruvin 13b It is recommended not to name a child after enemies of the Jews, like Sisera and Pharaoh, but to use the names of the Patriarchs (i.e. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob).Yoma 36b =Post-Talmudic period= As the Jews spread throughout the lands bordering the Mediterranean, they drew upon other languages for their personal names while still retaining Biblical ones, and they were especially prone to adopt names ending in -el. These new names became exceptionally popular in Italy. To this source must be traced the new name ·∏§ushiel, composed on the same plan as the Biblical ones ending in -el. The kings of the Khazars, so far as their names are known, wavered between pure Biblical names, like Obadiah, and local names, like Bulan. The Karaites in the same neighborhood adopted Tatar names, one of them being known as Toktamish; but elsewhere Karaite names are mostly Arabic and Persian. The custom of calling one of the sons, generally the eldest, after the paternal (sometimes the maternal) grandfather, of which only nine instances are known during the Talmudic period, became more popular, especially in European states. Maimonides' grandfather was Joseph ben Isaac ben Joseph ben Obadiah ben Solomon ben Obadiah, for instance, and certain families seem to have similarly confined themselves to a few chosen names. Thus, in the Kalonymus family there occurs Meshullam b. Moses b. Ithiel b. Moses b. Kalonymus b. Meshullam b. Kalonymus b. Moses b. Kalonymus b. Jekuthiel b. Moses b. Meshullam b. Ithiel b. Meshullam‚Äîonly five names among fourteen persons throughout three centuries. As a consequence certain names became characteristic of certain districts: Japheth and Caleb in Greece, and hence among the Karaites; Kalonymus in south Italy; Sheshet and Joab in Rome; Sinai and Pesa·∏• in Germany. Some of the older names were revived‚ÄîMe√Ør, for example, of which only two previous instances before, had been known, the tanna Me√Ør and the Me√Ør mentioned by Josephus.BJvi. 5, ¬ß 1 Samson was never used by Jews before the 11th century. Kinnuyim The most striking tendency of the post-Talmudic period is the general choice of local names by the Jews for their civic relations. This led to the adoption of two names, one for civic purposes, known as the kinnuy (probably from the Arabic kunyah), the other (shem ha-·∏≥odesh) for use in the synagogue and in all Hebrew documents. The latter, the \\"sacred\\" name, was as far as possible associated with the former, and was often a translation of a civic one, e.g., Asael for Diofatto, Manoah for Tranquillo, ·∏§ayyim for Vita; at times the civic name was merely a contraction of the sacred one, e.g., Leser for Eliezer, Sender for Alexander. In other cases mere similarity in sound was sufficient to determine the sacred name, as Mann for Menahem, Kalman for Kalonymus, and the like. Especially noteworthy was the use made of Jacob's blessing to transfer a personal name from the civic to the sacred sphere. Judah being compared to a lion's whelp in Jacob's blessing, Judah became Leo, or L√∂we, in lay relationship, and Ephraim became Fischlin. Later on these name-equations became so usual that they formed doublets, which were almost invariably found together, as Dov B√§r, Naphtali Hirsch, Solomon Zalman, Judah or Aryeh L√∂b, Binyamin Wolf, and these again gave currency to similar correlative names, as Uri Phoebus. =Titular abbreviations= It was during the Middle Ages that the somewhat curious custom arose of combining the abbreviation of a title with the initials of a name to form a single personal name. This almost invariably implies frequency of mention, and, therefore, celebrity. The best-known examples are those of RaSHI and RaMBaM, who are hardly ever quoted in rabbinical texts except by these names; but there exists a large number of similar contractions.For a fuller list see H√§ndler's list of abbreviations in Dalman's Talmudisches W√∂rterbuch. A somewhat similar use of a title is the combination with Messer, as in the Italian Messer Leon, while in Provence the honorary prefixes en-, for men, and na-, for women, are combined with the name to form Engusek (En-Joseph), Nabona, etc. Apart from these tendencies, the general trend of nomenclature among Jews in the Middle Ages was to adopt that of the countries in which they lived, the given names being often identical with those of the surrounding peoples, and other means of identification being derived mainly from localities or offices. Certain peculiarities of various countries may be taken separately. =Mizrahim= Among the Mizrahim (Arabic-speaking Jews living in the Middle-East) it was quite common to replace their Hebrew names with relevant Arabic ones, whenever they bore a religious note and were deemed sacred to both Jews and Muslims, so Abraham turned into Ibrahim, Aharon into Haroun, David into Daoud, Moshe into Moussa, and Shlomo into Soliman and Salman. The indication of a family's elevated religious status, which also gained its members the reverence of their non-Jewish neighbors, was expressed in Arabic through their name. One has to note that such names were often given by the surrounding non-Jewish communities, who confused the appropriate religious terms of the Halakhah. An example of this is the name Nader, which is the Arabic translation of Nazir: the Hebrew root word neizer (pronounced nay-zeer) means delineation or designation, and refers to the status of nezirut in which a person makes a vow to isolate himself from certain matters, such as intoxicating beverages, and other material luxuries (the absence of which would deaden his cravings for physical pleasures, as well as enhance his spiritual sensitivity and further his quest to attain spiritual heightenings), as well as things that are considered being tamea (spiritually unclean, such as corpses). Yet in the Arabic environment a family of Cohanim (descendants of Aaron and priests of the Beit haMiqdash), would often be described as such through the name Nazir, or Nader. The obvious reason behind the wrong usage of the term Nazir and its attribution to Cohanim, is the fact that the Mizrahi Cohanim had always strictly adhered to the relevant Halachic Laws which entail that they avoid coming into contact with corpses, lest they lose their status of purity, and which is similar to the rules that govern the status of nazarites, as well as their perception amongst their surrounding Arab neighbors, especially the Coptic Christians, as being consecrated (vowed) to the religious service of the Beit haMiqdash. Personal peculiarities also gave rise to a Jew's name in the Arab world, as Abyad referred to fair skin, Afia possessor of strength, health or well being, Tawil to a tall person. It was also quite usual that Hebrew names were translated into their corresponding meaning in the Arabic language, such as Adin into Latif, or Loutfi, Eleazar into Mansour, Gershom into Ghareeb, Mazliach into Maimun, Sameah into Said, and Tovia into Hassan, or Hassoun. Common segments of Mizrahi society adopted local Arabic names, such as Abdallah, Abdela, Abdo and Aboudi (all meaning servant of the Lord), Farag (relief), Massoud (fortunate), Mourad (aspired to), Nessim (fresh breeze), Sabah (morning), Sahl (ease), Salama, Salem and Selim (all meaning unharmed), Zaki (well-smelling), because of their beautiful meanings, or the good fortune they seemed to evoke. As had been the case within the Ashkenazi (Central and East European Jewish) cultural environment, Mizrahim bore names that related to their trades and occupations, such as Albaz (also Elbaz, Elvas meaning falconer), Aboutboul (Abitbol, Abiteboul, Abutbul, Botbol all meaning drummer, drum maker, or seller), Hayek and Khayat (which both mean tailor), Hakim (physician, or sage), Naggar (carpenter), Sabbagh (dyer of cloth), Sabban (soap maker), Sannoua (labourer), Sarrouf or assaraf (money changer), Shenhav (also Chenhav, Shenhavy, Chenhavy) all referring to ivory and mean ivory craftsman or trader. Yemenite Jewish names were often adopted by place names such as Tzanani (from Sana'a), Taeizi (from Taiz), Harazi (from Jabal Haraz), and Damari (from Dhamar). Other family names indicate pre-Islamic Jewish origin such as Kahalani (Kahlan) and Chorath (Bnei Chorath). Additionally, some Yemenite Jewish was related to their occupation such as Tabib/Taviv (doctor) and Qafih (poet). Mizrahim sought to avert the ein ha raa (evil eye) and envy by never calling the dearest of their children (especially, the firstborn son) by the real name. In their quest to protect a child, parents would even revert to such drastic measures as giving it a very unattractive nickname, such as Garboua (the one who is clad in rags), which has later become a family name. Contrary to Ashkenazim, the Mizrahim applied the rulings of Talmud Shabbat 134, which provides that a child be called after a living relative. This led to the creation of another Mizrahi particularity, where a child could be named Sarah bat Sarah, or Abraham ben Abraham, which as per Ashkenazi customs, would only have been applied to a ger (gerim being convertites to Judaism, and thus, deemed having become bnai brith, that is to say children of the Covenant, holding the status of children of the Patriarch Abraham and the Matriarch Sarah). Name giving also served as a social welfare tool, whereby poor parents sought to secure the support of a benefactor for their child, by naming him after a wealthy relative or employer, who would show his acceptance to look after the welfare of the child by presenting it with a first set of clothing, and later on support him with marriage expenses and the like. The Mizrahim also reverted to this measure, as a means to strengthening the family ties between a married woman and her blood relatives, whereby a newly born child would be named after the elder of the mother's family, or one of its notables, and thus, retain his material benevolence, as well as underline the husband's expressed will to align himself to his spouse's family and gain their goodwill, or at least not to estrange his wife from her roots. A peculiarity of the Arabic onomatology is the kunyah, the by- name given to a father after the birth of his son, by which he is named after the latter (Abou, Abo, or Abu followed by the name of his son). It may be added here that Abu al-Walid is a kunyah or by-name for Jonah. Abu also forms family names, as in the case of Abudarham, or Aboab. Here it has to be noted, that the word Abou was sometimes used in the sense of \\"owner\\", especially when it was followed by an object that was of importance to the manner in which the surrounding community perceived the person in question. The most prominent example for this is Abou Hassira (owner of a straw mat), a descendant of a long line of kabbalists and pietists from Morocco (born 1807 in Morocco, died 1880 in Egypt, buried in the village of Demitiouh, near Damanhour, in the Governorate of Beheira), whose real name Yaccov Ben Massoud has almost been forgotten, as he has become identified as Rabbi Abou Hassira since his pilgrimage from his homeland to Jerusalem, during which the boat he was on sank, yet he was miraculously saved because he hung on to his straw mat (hassira), which had been his only possession. For this the Egyptian population venerated him from that day on as a holy man and miracle worker, whose life had been protected by the Lord through a frail mat. Akin to this is the use of the Arabic Ibn which is relaten to Hebraic ben like in benjamin or ben yamin, (meaning son of, also spelled Aben, Aven, Avin) to form a family name amongst Mizrahim who lived in the Eastern part of the Arab world. Among the best known of this formation are Ibn Aknin, Ibn Danan (hence Abendana), Ibn Latif, Ibn Migas, Ibn Verga. Those Jews who lived in the North Africa countries (especially Morocco) chose the use of the word O or sometimes spelled \\"U\\" (belonging to), which created the names Ou'Hanna, (son of Hanna, also spelled Bohana, Abuhana, Abuhenna), O'Hayon (son of Life), O'Knine (son of Yacob, also spelled Waknin, Ouaknin). The Arabic article al appears in quite a number of names, as in Al-·∏§arisi. Other names of interest, given by Steinschneider in a long list of eight hundred Arabic names in the Jewish Quarterly Review (ix. -xiii.), are Ghayyat (in Spanish Gayet), Ibn Danan and Ibn al-Dayyal, Al-Haruni (\\"the Aaronide\\", the same as Cohen), Ibn Wa·∏≥ar, Ibn Zabara and Ibn Zimra, ·∏§aji (applied to Karaites who had performed the pilgrimage to Jerusalem), Ya·∏•ya (equivalent to John or Judah). Morel is said to be derived from Samuel; Molko means \\"royal\\"; Mas'ud is equivalent to Baruch; Mu·∏≥attil (\\"champion\\") would be a proper origin for the family name Mocatta; Najar and Najara refer to carpentry; Sasun is merely a transcript of Sason (\\"lily\\"). The proper names Sa‚Äòid, Saad, and Sa'dan are equally popular among Jews and Arabs. Abbas (\\"lion\\") corresponds to Judah, as Leo and the like in Europe. Very many Judeo-Arabic names are compounded of 'abd (\\"servant\\"), as Abdallah and 'Abd al-Walid. Al-Faraj occurs as the name of the translator at Girgenti, and it is possibly the remote origin of the curious name of Admiral Farragut, whose grandfather came from Menorca. It is considered doubtful whether the name of the ·∏≤im·∏•is is Hebrew in that form, or whether it should be pronounced as an Arabic word, ·∏≤am·∏•i (\\"formed of wheat\\"). =Sephardic Jews= Sephardic Jews in the Ottoman Empire were often known by multiple forms of their names, such as those in Ladino, Turkish, French, Hebrew, Arabic, and/or other European languages. Many were given names from the Bible.Cohen, Julia Philips and Sarah Abrevaya Stein (editors). Sephardi Lives: A Documentary History, 1700‚Äì1950. Stanford University Press, August 27, 2014. , 9780804791915. p. xxiv. Surname Jews have historically used Hebrew patronymic names. In the Jewish patronymic system the first name is followed by either ben- or bat- (\\"son of\\" and \\"daughter of\\", respectively), and then the father's name. (Bar-, \\"son of\\" in Aramaic, is also seen). Permanent family surnames exist today but only gained popularity among Sephardic Jews in Iberia as early as the 10th or 11th century and did not spread widely to the Ashkenazic Jews of Germany or Eastern Europe until the late 18th and mid 19th century, where the adoption of German surnames was imposed in exchange for Jewish emancipation. Although Ashkenazi Jews now use European or modern-Hebrew surnames for everyday life, the Hebrew patronymic form is still used in Jewish religious and cultural life, and is common in Israel. It is used in synagogue and in documents in Jewish law such as the ketubah (marriage contract). Many Sephardic Jews used the Arabic ibn instead of bat or ben when it was the norm. The Spanish family Ibn Ezra is one example. Many recent immigrants to Israel have changed their names to Hebrew ones, in a process called hebraization, to erase remnants of Diaspora history still present in family names from other languages. This is especially common among Ashkenazi Jews, because most of their European names do not go back far in history; surnames were imposed by the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires in the 18th century (explaining why many Ashkenazi Jews have German or European-sounding names). The newly-assumed Hebrew names were sometimes based on phonetic similarity with their former European surname, for example, Golda Meyersohn became Golda Meir. A popular form to create a new family name is the false patronymic, using the prefix \\"ben\\" or \\"bar\\" followed by words who are not the name of a parent. Examples include patriotic themes, such as ben Ami (\\"son of my people\\"), or ben Artzi (\\"son of my country\\"), and terms related to the Israeli landscape, such as bar Ilan (\\"son of the trees\\", also similar phonetically to the bearer's original family name Berlin). Another famous person who used a false patronymic is the first Israeli Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion. His former family name was Gr√ºn, and he adopted the name \\"Ben-Gurion\\" (\\"son of Gurion\\"), not \\"Ben- Avigdor\\" (his father's name). Gurion was a Jewish leader in the period of the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War.  Change of name  Change of name was not an unusual occurrence in Biblical times, if one may judge by the instances occurring among the Patriarchs, and it seems to have been not altogether unknown in later times. Thus, Moses Benveniste mentions a certain Obadiah who wandered from Germany to Turkey in 1654 and changed his name to Moses because the former name was unusual.Responsa, i. 40 Later in the Middle Ages a person who was dangerously sick would change his name in the hope that the Angel of Death, who summons persons by name, would be baffled thereby. This custom, known as meshanneh shem, is given in the TalmudR. H. 17a and is mentioned by Judah ·∏§asid.Sefer ·∏§asidim, No. 245. One of the names thus adopted was the appropriate one of ·∏§ayyim.For the various forms of ·∏§ayyim see Jew. Encyc. vi. 271. In order to prevent any misunderstanding at the resurrection the cabalists later recommended persons to learn a psalm the first and last verses of which began and ended with the first and last letters of their names. Particular care is to be taken in the writing of names in legal documents, the slightest error in which invalidates them. Hence there are quite a number of monographs on names, both personal and geographical, the first of which was that written by Sim·∏•ah Cohen; the best known is that of Samuel ben Phoebus and Ephraim Zalman Margulies entitled ·π¨ib Gi·π≠·π≠in. Superstitions It was thought that Jews of the same name should not live in the same town or permit their children to marry into each other's families;Sefer ·∏§asidim, Nos. 24‚Äì34 this seems to have some reference to exogamy. It is even urged that one should not marry a woman of the same name as one's mother; or that she should be required to change it. Even to the present day it is considered unlucky in Russia for a father-in-law to have the same name as the bridegroom. In other parts of Russia it is considered bad luck to name a child after a living relative. When several children have died in a family the next that is born has no name given to it, but is referred to as \\"Alter\\" (, literally \\"old\\"), or Alterke, the view being that the Angel of Death, not knowing the name of the child, will not be able to seize it. When such a child attains the marriageable age, a new name, generally that of one of the Patriarchs, is given to it. For a somewhat similar reason it is considered unlucky in Lithuania to call an only child by its true name. Pen-names =Religious authors named by their works= It is customary for well-known authors, beginning with medieval times, to be known by the titles of their works rather than by their own names. Thus, Jacob ben Asher is referred to as the ·π¨ur or the Ba'al ha-·π¨urim; Joseph Caro is known as the Bet Yosef; and Ezekiel Landau as Noda' bi-Yehudah. =Acronyms used for religious authors= Even more frequently were authors known by contracted forms of their names, with the addition of some honorary prefix, as given above. Among contemporary Hebrew writers this practice is still more widely observed, though no honorary title is prefixed. A list is given by Mo√Øse Schwab in his Repertoire.Schwab, Moise. Repertoire (Supplement, pp. 200-207) =Modern non-religious authors= Most Yiddish writers appear to prefer to write under some pen-name or pseudonym, and their example is at times followed by modern writers of Hebrew, though these, as a rule, prefer to give a name composed of their initials. Of course, other Jewish writers besides the above have adopted pen-names. Israel Zangwill has written under the names \\"J. Freeman Bell\\" (in collaboration), \\"Countess von S.\\", and \\"Marshallik\\"; Mrs. Frankau is known as \\"Frank Danby\\"; and so on; but there is nothing specifically Jewish about this adoption of a pen-name.

Common uses include processing waste water, capturing harmful chemicals or silt from surface runoff, and microbiotic oxidation of contaminants in air. Examples of biofiltration Examples of biofiltration include: * Bioswales, biostrips, biobags, bioscrubbers, Vermifilters and trickling filters * Constructed wetlands and natural wetlands * Slow sand filters * Treatment ponds * Green belts * Green walls * Riparian zones, riparian forests, bosques * Bivalve bioaccumulation Control of air pollution When applied to air filtration and purification, biofilters use microorganisms to remove air pollution. The air flows through a packed bed and the pollutant transfers into a thin biofilm on the surface of the packing material. Microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi are immobilized in the biofilm and degrade the pollutant. Trickling filters and bioscrubbers rely on a biofilm and the bacterial action in their recirculating waters. The technology finds greatest application in treating malodorous compounds and water-soluble volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Industries employing the technology include food and animal products, off-gas from wastewater treatment facilities, pharmaceuticals, wood products manufacturing, paint and coatings application and manufacturing and resin manufacturing and application, etc. Compounds treated are typically mixed VOCs and various sulfur compounds, including hydrogen sulfide. Very large airflows may be treated and although a large area (footprint) has typically been required‚Äîa large biofilter (>200,000 acfm) may occupy as much or more land than a football field‚Äîthis has been one of the principal drawbacks of the technology. Engineered biofilters, designed and built since the early 1990s, have provided significant footprint reductions over the conventional flat-bed, organic media type. Air cycle system at biosolids composting plant. Large duct in foreground is exhaust air into biofilter shown in previous photo One of the main challenges to optimum biofilter operation is maintaining proper moisture throughout the system. The air is normally humidified before it enters the bed with a watering (spray) system, humidification chamber, bioscrubber, or biotrickling filter. Properly maintained, a natural, organic packing media like peat, vegetable mulch, bark or wood chips may last for several years but engineered, combined natural organic, and synthetic component packing materials will generally last much longer, up to 10 years. A number of companies offer these types or proprietary packing materials and multi-year guarantees, not usually provided with a conventional compost or wood chip bed biofilter. Although widely employed, the scientific community is still unsure of the physical phenomena underpinning biofilter operation, and information about the microorganisms involved continues to be developed. A biofilter/bio- oxidation system is a fairly simple device to construct and operate and offers a cost-effective solution provided the pollutant is biodegradable within a moderate time frame (increasing residence time = increased size and capital costs), at reasonable concentrations (and lb/hr loading rates) and that the airstream is at an organism-viable temperature. For large volumes of air, a biofilter may be the only cost-effective solution. There is no secondary pollution (unlike the case of incineration where additional CO2 and NOx are produced from burning fuels) and degradation products form additional biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Media irrigation water, although many systems recycle part of it to reduce operating costs, has a moderately high biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and may require treatment before disposal. However, this \\"blowdown water\\", necessary for proper maintenance of any bio- oxidation system, is generally accepted by municipal publicly owned treatment works without any pretreatment. Biofilters are being utilized in Columbia Falls, Montana at Plum Creek Timber Company's fiberboard plant. The biofilters decrease the pollution emitted by the manufacturing process and the exhaust emitted is 98% clean. The newest, and largest, biofilter addition to Plum Creek cost $9.5 million, yet even though this new technology is expensive, in the long run it will cost less overtime than the alternative exhaust-cleaning incinerators fueled by natural gas (which are not as environmentally friendly). Water treatment A typical complete trickling filter system for treating wastewaters. Image 1: A schematic cross-section of the contact face of the bed media in a trickling filter. Biofiltration was first introduced in England in 1893 as a trickling filter for wastewater treatment and has since been successfully used for the treatment of different types of water. Biological treatment has been used in Europe to filter surface water for drinking purposes since the early 1900s and is now receiving more interest worldwide. Biofiltration is also common in wastewater treatment, aquaculture and greywater recycling, as a way to minimize water replacement while increasing water quality. =Biofiltration process= A biofilter is a bed of media on which microorganisms attach and grow to form a biological layer called biofilm. Biofiltration is thus usually referred to as a fixed‚Äìfilm process. Generally, the biofilm is formed by a community of different microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, yeast, etc.), macro-organisms (protozoa, worms, insect's larvae, etc.) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) (Flemming and Wingender, 2010). The aspect of the biofilm is usually slimy and muddy. Water to be treated can be applied intermittently or continuously over the media, via upflow or downflow. Typically, a biofilter has two or three phases, depending on the feeding strategy (percolating or submerged biofilter): * a solid phase (media); * a liquid phase (water); * a gaseous phase (air). Organic matter and other water components diffuse into the biofilm where the treatment occurs, mostly by biodegradation. Biofiltration processes are usually aerobic, which means that microorganisms require oxygen for their metabolism. Oxygen can be supplied to the biofilm, either concurrently or countercurrently with water flow. Aeration occurs passively by the natural flow of air through the process (three phase biofilter) or by forced air supplied by blowers. Microorganisms' activity is a key-factor of the process performance. The main influencing factors are the water composition, the biofilter hydraulic loading, the type of media, the feeding strategy (percolation or submerged media), the age of the biofilm, temperature, aeration, etc. =Types of filtering media= Most biofilters use media such as sand, crushed rock, river gravel, or some form of plastic or ceramic material shaped as small beads and rings. =Advantages= Although biological filters have simple superficial structures, their internal hydrodynamics and the microorganisms' biology and ecology are complex and variable. These characteristics confer robustness to the process. In other words, the process has the capacity to maintain its performance or rapidly return to initial levels following a period of no flow, of intense use, toxic shocks, media backwash (high rate biofiltration processes), etc. The structure of the biofilm protects microorganisms from difficult environmental conditions and retains the biomass inside the process, even when conditions are not optimal for its growth. Biofiltration processes offer the following advantages: (Rittmann et al., 1988): * Because microorganisms are retained within the biofilm, biofiltration allows the development of microorganisms with relatively low specific growth rates; * Biofilters are less subject to variable or intermittent loading and to hydraulic shock; * Operational costs are usually lower than for activated sludge; * Final treatment result is less influenced by biomass separation since the biomass concentration at the effluent is much lower than for suspended biomass processes; * Attached biomass becomes more specialized (higher concentration of relevant organisms) at a given point in the process train because there is no biomass return. =Drawbacks= Because filtration and growth of biomass leads to an accumulation of matter in the filtering media, this type of fixed-film process is subject to bioclogging and flow channeling. Depending on the type of application and on the media used for microbial growth, bioclogging can be controlled using physical and/or chemical methods. Whenever possible, backwash steps can be implemented using air and/or water to disrupt the biomat and recover flow. Chemicals such as oxidizing (peroxide, ozone) or biocide agents can also be used. Drinking water For drinking water, biological water treatment involves the use of naturally occurring microorganisms in the surface water to improve water quality. Under optimum conditions, including relatively low turbidity and high oxygen content, the organisms break down material in the water and thus improve water quality. Slow sand filters or carbon filters are used to provide a support on which these microorganisms grow. These biological treatment systems effectively reduce water-borne diseases, dissolved organic carbon, turbidity and color in surface water, thus improving overall water quality. Wastewater Biofiltration is used to treat wastewater from a wide range of sources, with varying organic compositions and concentrations. Many examples of biofiltration applications are described in the literature. Bespoke biofilters have been developed and commercialized for the treatment of animal wastes, landfill leachates, dairy wastewater, domestic wastewater. This process is versatile as it can be adapted to small flows (< 1 m3/d), such as onsite sewage as well as to flows generated by a municipality (> 240 000 m3/d). For decentralized domestic wastewater production, such as for isolated dwellings, it has been demonstrated that there are important daily, weekly and yearly fluctuations of hydraulic and organic production rates related to modern families' lifestyle. In this context, a biofilter located after a septic tank constitutes a robust process able to sustain the variability observed without compromising the treatment performance. Use in aquaculture The use of biofilters is common in closed aquaculture systems, such as recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). Many designs are used, with different benefits and drawbacks, however the function is the same: reducing water exchanges by converting ammonia to nitrate. Ammonia (NH4+ and NH3) originates from the brachial excretion from the gills of aquatic animals and from the decomposition of organic matter. As ammonia-N is highly toxic, this is converted to a less toxic form of nitrite (by Nitrosomonas sp.) and then to an even less toxic form of nitrate (by Nitrobacter sp.). This \\"nitrification\\" process requires oxygen (aerobic conditions), without which the biofilter can crash. Furthermore, as this nitrification cycle produces H+, the pH can decrease which necessitates the use of buffers such as lime.

North Carolina was discovered to be structurally unsound and unsuitable for use on the open ocean; her hull had become riddled with shipworm as a result of the green hull timber used for her construction. She remained in the Cape Fear River, where she had developed bad leaks, until she finally foundered on 27 September 1864, just off Smithville (modern Southport); she was serving there as a guard ship.

Commercial paper is a money-market security issued (sold) by large corporations to obtain funds to meet short-term debt obligations (for example, payroll) and is backed only by an issuing bank or company promise to pay the face amount on the maturity date specified on the note. Since it is not backed by collateral, only firms with excellent credit ratings from a recognized credit rating agency will be able to sell their commercial paper at a reasonable price. Commercial paper is usually sold at a discount from face value and generally carries lower interest repayment rates than bonds due to the shorter maturities of commercial paper. Typically, the longer the maturity on a note, the higher the interest rate the issuing institution pays. Interest rates fluctuate with market conditions but are typically lower than banks' rates. Commercial paper ‚Äì though a short-term obligation ‚Äì is issued as part of a continuous rolling program, which is either a number of years long (as in Europe) or open-ended (as in the US). Several kinds of Commercial Papers with credit enhancement are issued in the developed markets today that offer diverse benefits to investors and issuers. Overview The use of commercial paper has been adopted by every state in the United States except Louisiana.Ontario Securities Commission National Instrument 45‚Äì106 (Section 2.35) Accessed January 30, 2007 At the end of 2009, more than 1,700 companies in the United States issued commercial paper. As of October 31, 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve reported seasonally adjusted figures for the end of 2007: there was $1.7807 trillion in total outstanding commercial paper; $801.3 billion was \\"asset backed\\" and $979.4 billion was not; $162.7 billion of the latter was issued by non- financial corporations, and $816.7 billion was issued by financial corporations. Outside of the United States the international Euro-Commercial Paper Market has over $500 billion in outstandings, made up of instruments denominated predominantly in euros, dollars and sterling. History Commercial credit (trade credit), in the form of promissory notes issued by corporations, has existed since at least the 19th century. For instance, Marcus Goldman, founder of Goldman Sachs, got his start trading commercial paper in New York in 1869. Issuance U.S. Commercial Paper types outstanding at end of each year 2001 to 2007 Total U.S. CP outstanding e Commercial paper ‚Äì though a short-term obligation ‚Äì is issued as part of a continuous significantly longer rolling program, which is either a number of years long (as in Europe), or open-ended (as in the U.S.). Because the continuous commercial paper program is much longer than the individual commercial paper in the program (which cannot be longer than 270 days), as commercial paper matures it is replaced with newly issued commercial paper for the remaining amount of the obligation. If the maturity is less than 270 days, the issuer does not have to file a registrations statement with the SEC, which would mean delay and increased cost. There are two methods of issuing credit. The issuer can market the securities directly to a buy and hold investor such as most money market funds. Alternatively, it can sell the paper to a dealer, who then sells the paper in the market. The dealer market for commercial paper involves large securities firms and subsidiaries of bank holding companies. Most of these firms also are dealers in US Treasury securities. Direct issuers of commercial paper usually are financial companies that have frequent and sizable borrowing needs and find it more economical to sell paper without the use of an intermediary. In the United States, direct issuers save a dealer fee of approximately 5 basis points, or 0.05% annualized, which translates to $50,000 on every $100 million outstanding. This saving compensates for the cost of maintaining a permanent sales staff to market the paper. Dealer fees tend to be lower outside the United States. Line of credit Commercial paper is a lower-cost alternative to a line of credit with a bank. Once a business becomes established, and builds a high credit rating, it is often cheaper to draw on a commercial paper than on a bank line of credit. Nevertheless, many companies still maintain bank lines of credit as a \\"backup\\". Banks often charge fees for the amount of the line of the credit that does not have a balance, because under the capital regulatory regimes set out by the Basel Accords, banks must anticipate that such unused lines of credit will be drawn upon if a company gets into financial distress. They must therefore put aside equity capital to account for potential loan losses also on the currently unused part of lines of credit, and will usually charge a fee for the cost of this equity capital. Advantages of commercial paper: * High credit ratings fetch a lower cost of capital. * Wide range of maturity provide more flexibility. * It does not create any lien on asset of the company. * Tradability of Commercial Paper provides investors with exit options. Disadvantages of commercial paper: * Its usage is limited to only blue chip companies. * Issuances of commercial paper bring down the bank credit limits. * A high degree of control is exercised on issue of Commercial Paper. * Stand-by credit may become necessary Commercial paper yields Like treasury bills, yields on commercial paper are quoted on a discount basis‚Äîthe discount return to commercial paper holders is the annualized percentage difference between the price paid for the paper and the face value using a 360-day year. Specifically, where dy_{CP} is the discount yield, P_f is the face value, P_0 is the price paid, and t is the term length of the paper in days: : dy_{CP} = (\\\\frac{P_{f} - P_{0}}{P_{f}}).\\\\frac{360}{t} and when converted to a bond equivalent yield ( bey_{CP} ): : bey_{CP} = (\\\\frac{P_{f} - P_{0}}{P_{0}}).\\\\frac{365}{t} Defaults Defaults on high quality commercial paper are rare, and cause concern when they occur. Notable examples include: * On June 21, 1970, Penn Central filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and defaulted on approximately $77.1 million of commercial paper. This sparked a runoff in the commercial paper market of approximately $3 billion, causing the Federal Reserve to intervene by permitting commercial banks to borrow at the discount window.U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, The Financial Collapse of the Penn Central Company, Staff Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Special Subcommittee on Investigations, U.S. Government Printing Office Washington DC 1972, page 272. This placed a substantial burden on clients of the issuing dealer for Penn Central‚Äôs commercial paper, Goldman Sachs.Ellis, Charles D. The Partnership: The Making of Goldman Sachs. Rev. ed. London: Penguin, 2009. 98. Print. * On January 31, 1997, Mercury Finance, a major automotive lender, defaulted on a debt of $17 million, rising to $315 million. Effects were small, partly because default occurred during a robust economy. * On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers caused two money funds to break the buck, and led to Fed intervention in money market funds. * In case of default, the issuer of commercial paper (large corporate) would be debarred for 6 months and credit ratings would be dropped down from existing to \\"Default\\".

Background and career The son of a semi-professional musician, Moore was born and raised in Eureka, California. He studied music at Humboldt State and in 1977 graduated from the New England Conservatory of Music, where he studied with Jaki Byard and Gunther Schuller, and was a classmate of Marty Ehrlich. He played in a variety of musical contexts, especially those in support of theatre and dance groups. By 1982 he was a regular member of Misha Mengelberg's Instant Composers Pool and had moved to Amsterdam. He was also a member of Georg Gr√§we's Grubenklang Orchester. Moore is one-third of the Clusone Trio (aka Trio Clusone and Clusone 3) with cellist Ernst Reijseger and drummer Han Bennink. Originally meant only to play a single date at a festival in Clusone, Italy, the trio toured irregularly for several years and recorded six albums, including one of freely-interpreted Irving Berlin compositions. Moore's first recording as a leader was in 1992 but it was with 1994's Chicoutimi that he began to earn recognition as a composer. The drummerless trio on this album (Fred Hersch, piano, and Mark Helias, bass) was inspired by the duo recordings of Lee Konitz and Gil Evans and recalls in places the Jimmy Giuffre trios of the early 1960s. Moore also plays in Jewels and Binoculars, a collective trio with bassist Lindsey Horner and drummer Michael Vatcher which is devoted to interpretations of Bob Dylan songs. In 1986, Moore won the VPRO/Boy Edgar Award, the most prestigious jazz award in the Netherlands. In 1991, he founded Ramboy Records to document his music. Moore started his jazz quintet in 2005, in which he works with accomplished Dutch players: trumpeter Eric Vloeimans, pianist Marc van Roon, bassist Paul Berner, and drummer Owen Hart, Jr. In October 2005, the quintet recorded the album Osiris. In 2013, he performed with InstanPool, a group of international musicians making improved music and occasionally playing a composition. InstanPool consists of Michael Moore and Mark Alban Lotz (winds), Korhan Erel and Robert van Heumen (laptops), Sevket Akinci and Giray G√ºrkal (guitars, electronics). Some members are also in Islak K√∂pek.

Engine production averages 10 million units per year as of April 2015. The company reports that it has 13 large facilities in the U.S. and 8 more in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Mexico, and the Netherlands. The company's products are sold in over 100 countries across the globe. History Launched in 1908 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the company is based today in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. Briggs & Stratton engines are commonly used on lawnmowers, as well as pressure washers, electrical generators, go-karts, and a wide variety of other applications. Their original cast-iron engines were known for their durability, but the company's success was established following the development of lightweight aluminum engines in 1953. The aluminum engine was the perfect solution for the recently invented rotary lawnmower due to its lighter weight and lower cost. The company started in 1908 as an informal partnership between Stephen Foster Briggs and Harold M. Stratton. S.F. Briggs was born in Watertown, South Dakota, and graduated from South Dakota State College ((SDSC) now South Dakota State University) in Brookings in 1907. The idea for his first product came from an upper-level engineering class project at SDSC. This first product was a six-cylinder, two-cycle engine, which Stephen Foster Briggs developed during his engineering courses at South Dakota State. After his graduation, he was eager to produce his engine and enter the rapidly expanding automobile industry. Bill Juneau, a coach at South Dakota State, knew of Briggs' ambition and the entrepreneurial interests of Harold M. Stratton, a successful grain merchant who had a farm next to Juneau's farm, so he introduced the two. In 1922, their fledgling company set a record in the automotive industry, selling the Briggs & Stratton Flyer (the \\"Red Bug\\") at record low prices of US$125-$150. Eventually Briggs and Stratton settled on manufacturing automotive components and small gasoline engines. Briggs purchased an engine patent from A.O. Smith Company and began powering early washing machines and reel mowers as well as many other types of equipment. The company went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1928. During World War II, Briggs & Stratton produced generators for the war effort. Some pre-war engines were made with aluminum, which helped the company develop its expertise in using this material. This development, along with the post-war growth of 1950s suburbs (and lawns), helped secure Briggs & Stratton's successful growth throughout the 1950s and 1960s. Stephen Briggs went on to purchase Evinrude and Johnson Outboards and start the Outboard Marine Corporation. Frederick P. Stratton, Sr. (the son of Harold Stratton) served as Chairman of Briggs & Stratton until his death in 1962 (Harold also died that year). Frederick P. Stratton, Jr. served as Chairman until his retirement in 2001. In 1995, Briggs & Stratton sold the automotive component business. The resulting company is Strattec Security Corporation. In 2000, the company acquired its consumer generator business from the Beacon Group and formed Briggs & Stratton Power Products. The Beacon Group had previously purchased the Consumer Products Division of Generac Corporation (now Generac Power Systems) in 1998. In 2005, the company added Simplicity Manufacturing Inc, and Snapper, Inc, to the Briggs & Stratton Power Products line. Murray, Inc, one of its largest customers, collapsed owing the company $40 million, and to minimize the loss Briggs & Stratton purchased the name, marketing rights and product designs of that company. In 2008, Briggs & Stratton announced it would be acquiring the Victa Lawn Care business from GUD Holdings Limited Australia for A$23 million. In 2019, Briggs & Stratton announced they would be closing their engine factory in Murray, Kentucky with production being moved to their Poplar Bluff, Missouri facility. On July 20, 2020, Briggs & Stratton filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. KPS Capital Partners would purchase a majority of the company stake for $550 Million.https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2020/07/20/briggs- stratton-small-engine-maker-files-bankruptcy-protection/5473165002/ On September 22, 2020 KPS Capital Partners closed on the acquisition of Briggs and Stratton. This sale waives the $900million that Briggs owed going into bankruptcy.https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/briggs--stratton- announces-completion-of-sale-to-kps-capital-partners-301135796.html Acquisitions, agreements and joint ventures * Farymann Diesel GmbH (1979‚Äì1984) ‚Äì Based in Lampertheim (near Mannheim) in Germany, this was the first foreign acquisition Briggs & Stratton had ever made and was a poor fit with the company's acknowledged expertise in high volume, low cost production. They officially completed the acquisition on May 29, 1979.Briggs & Stratton 1980 Update Seminar, form #MS-7865-10/79 Despite investing in new production methods, Briggs & Stratton never understood the very low volume, highly customized nature of the air-cooled diesel engine market. After considering adding Italy's Lombardini to increase its presence in the diesel market, as well as a failed attempt to develop its own designs, Briggs & Stratton accepted defeat and sold the company to a private investor for a minimal amount to avoid further liabilities. Since the energy crisis had not affected the US market's preference for gasoline engines, enthusiasm waned rapidly at management level for diesel engines.The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, Chapter 12, pages 138-140 * Daihatsu Briggs & Stratton (DBS) ‚Äì In an effort to stave off Japanese competition during the 1980s, Briggs & Stratton entered a 50/50 joint venture with the Toyota subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Company in Japan. Located in Shiga Prefecture ( from Osaka, Japan), construction on the then- plant began in December 1986 and was completed in April 1987. This joint venture was notable for the manufacture of vertical and horizontal crankshaft engines from 12.5 to under the Vanguard brand. Today the plant employs roughly 100 people on two shifts and manufactures Vanguard V-twin engines ranging from 14 to .The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, 1995, Chapter 12, page 149 By the end of 2017, Briggs & Stratton is planning to move the production of Vanguard V-twin from Japan to USA https://www.briggsandstratton.com/na/en_us/news-room/briggs-and-stratton-to- move-product-from-japan-to-georgia-and-alabama.html * The Mitsubishi Agreement ‚Äì The Vanguard line initially consisted of three single-cylinder engines and several V-twin engines. The V-twins, made by DBS, had sold very well but the single-cylinder engine models, originally produced at Briggs & Stratton's Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin plant, didn't fare so well. Briggs & Stratton needed to solve this problem, so, following discussions with several Japanese engine manufacturers, it entered into an agreement with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. of Tokyo, Japan. Briggs & Stratton produced only certain parts for the engines, while Mitsubishi was responsible for overall production and shipping. The completed single-cylinder Vanguard engines were shipped directly to customers worldwide. Briggs & Stratton had exclusive marketing rights only in North America, Europe and Australia/New Zealand. MHI had exclusive marketing rights (under their own brand name) in Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan. In other countries both companies competed with the same product under their own brand names which led to considerable friction, and together with escalating production costs in Japan, caused this otherwise successful relationship to fail. Briggs & Stratton commenced marketing alternative U.S.-made single-cylinder engines under the Vanguard brand in early 2007.The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, 1995, Chapter 12, pages 149-152 * The Komatsu Zenoah Venture ‚Äì In May 1987, Briggs & Stratton entered into an agreement with yet another Japanese company, executing a 10-year contract with the Komatsu Zenoah Company of Tachikawa, Japan. Under the terms of the contract, Komatsu would manufacture a 2-cycle, 4 hp (3 kW) engine, in which Briggs & Stratton would purchase and distribute in the United States, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Said Fred Stratton, \\"This venture was not successful, because the rising price of the yen made the engine too expensive in the U.S.\\"The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, 1995, Chapter 12, pages 153-154 * The Toro Agreement ‚Äì In 1999, Briggs & Stratton made a license agreement with The Toro Company of Bloomington, Minnesota USA. to produce the Toro R*Tek piston ported version of their E series 2-stroke engine (AKA Lawn-Boy DuraForce) for use in Toro Snow Throwers. The engine was a 141cc 2 cycle that produced from 4 hp to 6.5 hp at 3700 to 4000 rpm on a 50:1 gas & oil mix. A higher power 7-HP model was made (Engine Model# 84330) for use in heavier duty machines such as the single stage Snow Commander (2001-2008) & 2 stage Power Max 726TE/6000 (2004-2008), the extra horsepower was obtained using Transfer Ports in the piston & cylinder wall and ran at the same operating speed as the 6.5 hp engines (4000rpms). Production stopped in 2011.  Innovations  *The aluminum engine ‚Äì This was introduced in 1953 as a means of having a lighter-weight engine for applications such as rotary lawn mowers. It was improved five years later in 1958 with the introduction of the Kool-Bore (all aluminum) and Sleeve-Bore (aluminum, with a cast iron cylinder liner). *Easy-Spin Starting ‚Äì This compression release, implemented as an extra hump on the intake lobe of the camshaft, was introduced in 1961 to reduce the effort required to start an engine.The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, Chapter 11, pages 120-121 In 1982, a new U.S. federal safety regulation required lawnmower blades to stop spinning within three seconds of the operator letting go of the handle. The least costly, most common way of complying with the new regulation was to put a flywheel brake on the mower engine, to stop the engine (and therefore the blade) immediately when the handle was released. Briggs & Stratton engineers found engines with the Easy-Spin camshaft were unacceptably difficult to restart after being braked to a quick stop. The Easy-Spin lobe hump was moved to the exhaust valve, but this reduced engine performance. The intake-side Easy-Spin remained in use on Briggs & Stratton's engines larger than those used on mowers subject to the brake requirement, but was discontinued in 1997 due to tightening emission regulations.The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, Chapter 11, page 121 *The Synchro-Balanced Engine ‚Äì This 1966 innovation was designed to attenuate vibration caused by the reciprocating mass of a single- cylinder engine. The design was a series of counterweights opposing the crankpin.The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, Chapter 11, pages 121-122 *The Twin Cylinder Engine ‚Äì This engine was introduced in 1977 as a means of competing with Briggs & Stratton's rivals, particularly Japanese firms like Honda who were cutting into traditional Briggs & Stratton markets by producing lawn mower engines (and later, complete lawn mowers). These first models were rated 16 hp (11.9 kW) and displaced 40 cubic inches (656 cc), but were joined in 1979 by 42 cubic inch (694 cc) models rated at 18 hp (13.4 kW). The original price for the version was $70 lower (at US$228) than their single-cylinder cast-iron version bearing the same power rating.The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, Chapter 11, page 127 *Industrial/Commercial (I/C) ‚Äì This series of engines, initially ranging from 3 to , was introduced in 1979 as Briggs & Stratton's answer to high quality commercial-duty engines produced by competitors. These engines include heavy- duty features such as Stellite exhaust valves, upgraded bearings, cast iron sleeved cylinder bores and high-capacity air cleaners.The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, Chapter 12, pages 140-141 *Briggs & Stratton HYBRID ‚Äì In 1980, at the tail end of the energy crisis, Briggs & Stratton developed the first gasoline-electric hybrid automobile. \\"The Hybrid\\" was designed by Brooks Stevens and powered by a twin-cylinder 16 hp (11.9 kW) Briggs & Stratton engine and a large bank of 6v lead-acid electric batteries. *Magnetron Ignition ‚Äì This solid state ignition system introduced by Briggs & Stratton in 1982The Legend of Briggs & Stratton by Jeffrey L. Rodengen, Chapter 12, pages 141-142 eliminated the points and condenser system, the performance of which steadily degraded between required periodic maintenance service. Magnetron was made available for retrofitment to Briggs & Stratton engines made since 1963. Competitor Tecumseh had made a capacitor discharge ignition setup since 1968 for their cast iron engine models, expanding its availability and making it standard equipment on vertical shaft engines powering lawn mowers in late 1976, five years before the advent of the Briggs Magnetron. Defunct competitor Clinton Engines commercialized a piezo \\"Spark Pump\\" ignition without breaker points in the early 1960s.\\"No coil, no points, no condenser: Spark Pump Fires Engine\\": Popular Science, July 1961  Logo history  The Briggs & Stratton logo was always a masthead, but it has been changed several times over the course of the company's 80-plus years. *Pre War logos (1931‚Äì1943) ‚Äì This logo started off with a diamond shape and read Briggs & Stratton and its home city of MILWAUKEE, WIS., U.S.A. below it; in the middle, it had the words 4 CYCLE on the top mast and the words GASOLINE MOTOR and phrase MADE IN U.S.A. on the bottom mast. About 1934 Briggs & Stratton added the more familiar shape of a diamond split across the center with a banner. *Gold Logo (1948‚Äì1963) ‚Äì This logo had the name BRIGGS STRATTON and its home city of MILWAUKEE, WIS., U.S.A. below it; in the middle, it had the words 4 CYCLE on the top mast and the words GASOLINE ENGINE and phrase MADE IN U.S.A. on the bottom mast. *Gold Logo (II) (1963‚Äì1976) ‚Äì Although similar to the last logo, this had differently arranged wording: The name BRIGGS STRATTON was written in a new logotype, however, this design also included the horsepower rating above the gold logo in the white field, its city of location were in the middle as before, only this time the patent numbers were eliminated (if you look at a decal on a production engine) from the bottom portion of the mast. There were some engines produced until 1977 that used the prior logo from 1948. *The Red, White and Black Logo (1976‚Äìpresent) ‚Äì This is the company's current logo. The logo has the name BRIGGS STRATTON in black letters on the white midsection of the masthead. The words 4 CYCLE ENGINE are on the red top portion of the mast and the city line MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN, U.S.A. is written on the black bottom portion of the mast. Although the logo hadn't been changed much since then, the wording on the top and bottom sections of the mast were removed in 1985, although the company continued to use these two sections with the respective wordings ORIGINAL (red section) and SERVICE PARTS (black section) until 1989.

He was the son of composer Earl Robinson.[ Allmusic biography] Biography Robinson was born and grew up in New York City. He attended the Lenox School of Jazz in Massachusetts in the summer of 1959. Robinson served in a U.S. military band in the early 1960s. His first record, Funk Dumpling (with Kenny Barron, Henry Grimes, and Paul Motian) was recorded by Savoy in 1962. He also appeared with Grimes on The Call in 1965, on the ESP-Disk label (ESP 1026). Although the album is credited to \\"Henry Grimes Trio\\" the album liner notes, written by ESP-Disk label head Bernard Stollman, state: \\"[Grimes] chose Perry Robinson, a virtuoso who merits far wider recognition, to pair with, and this recording reflects both of their contributions, in equal measure. A more accurate title for the album would be Henry Grimes/Perry Robinson.\\" Two of the album's six songs are credited to Robinson, including the title track. From 1973, Robinson worked with Jeanne Lee and Gunter Hampel's Galaxie Dream Band. He contributed to Dave Brubeck' s Two Generations of Brubeck and played with Burton Greene' s Dutch klezmer band Klezmokum. He was the featured clarinetist on Archie Shepp's LP Mama Too Tight on the Impulse! label. He led his own groups in performances and on record, with albums on the Chiaroscuro, WestWind, and Timescraper labels. More recently, he worked with William Parker and Walter Perkins on Bob's Pink Cadillac and several discs on the CIMP label. From 1975 until 1977, Robinson was a member of the Clarinet Contrast group, which featured German clarinet players Theo J√∂rgensmann and Bernd Konrad. He recorded with Lou Grassi as a member of his PoBand since the late Nineties, and with Lou Grassi, Wayne Lopes and Luke Faust in The Jug Jam, an improvisational jug band. He plays in a free jazz and world music trio along with tabla player Badal Roy and bassist Ed Schuller, with whom he recorded the CD Raga Roni. He played with Darius Brubeck and Muruga Booker in the MBR jazz trio. Robinson also played an integral part in the formation of Cosmic Legends, an improvisational music/performance group led by composer/pianist Sylvie Degiez which included musicians Rashied Ali, Wayne Lopes, Hayes Greenfield, and Michael Hashim. In 2005 he was featured on his cousin Jeffrey Lewis' album City and Eastern Songs on Rough Trade Records, produced by Kramer. A later release was OrthoFunkOlogy in 2008 with the band Free Funk, also featuring Muruga Booker, Badal Roy, and Shakti Ma Booker. His autobiography, Perry Robinson: The Traveler (co-authored by Florence F. Wetzel), was published in 2002.

Her 832-page biography of Mao Zedong, Mao: The Unknown Story, written with her husband, the Irish historian Jon Halliday, was published in June 2005. Life in China Xue Zhiheng, Jung Chang's grandfather Chang was born on 25 March 1952 in Yibin, Sichuan Province. Her parents were both Communist Party of China officials, and her father was greatly interested in literature. As a child she quickly developed a love of reading and writing, which included composing poetry. As Party cadres, life was relatively good for her family at first; her parents worked hard, and her father became successful as a propagandist at a regional level. His formal ranking was as a \\"level 10 official\\", meaning that he was one of 20,000 or so most important cadres, or ganbu, in the country. The Communist Party provided her family with a dwelling in a guarded, walled compound, a maid and chauffeur, as well as a wet-nurse and nanny for Chang and her four siblings. This level of privilege in China's relatively impoverished 1950s was extraordinary. Chang writes that she was originally named Er-hong (), which sounds like the Chinese word for \\"faded red\\". As communists were \\"deep red\\", she asked her father to rename her when she was 12 years old, specifying she wanted \\"a name with a military ring to it.\\" He suggested \\"Jung\\", which means \\"martial affairs.\\" =Cultural Revolution= Like many of her peers, Chang chose to become a Red Guard at the age of 14, during the early years of the Cultural Revolution. In Wild Swans she said she was \\"keen to do so\\", \\"thrilled by my red armband\\".Jung Chang, Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China (London, 2004), p. 378. In her memoirs, Chang states that she refused to participate in the attacks on her teachers and other Chinese, and she left after a short period as she found the Red Guards too violent. The failures of the Great Leap Forward had led her parents to oppose Mao Zedong's policies. They were targeted during the Cultural Revolution, as most high-ranking officials were. When Chang's father criticised Mao by name, Chang writes in Wild Swans that this exposed them to retaliation from Mao's supporters. Her parents were publicly humiliated ‚Äì ink was poured over their heads, they were forced to wear placards denouncing them around their necks, kneel in gravel and to stand outside in the rain ‚Äì followed by imprisonment, her father's treatment leading to lasting physical and mental illness. Their careers were destroyed, and her family was forced to leave their home. Before her parents' denunciation and imprisonment, Chang had unquestioningly supported Mao and criticised herself for any momentary doubts.Jung Chang, Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China (London, 2004), p. 270. But by the time of his death, her respect for Mao, she writes, had been destroyed. Chang wrote that when she heard he had died, she had to bury her head in the shoulder of another student to pretend she was grieving. She explained her change on the stance of Mao with the following comments: According to Wild Swans (chapter 23-chapter 28), Chang's life during the Cultural Revolution and the years immediately after the Cultural Revolution was one of both a victim and one of the privileged. Chang attended Sichuan University in 1973 and became one of the so-called \\"Students of Workers, Peasants and Soldiers\\". Her father's government-sponsored official funeral was held in 1975. Chang was able to leave China and study in the UK on a Chinese government scholarship in 1978, a year before the post-Mao Reforms began. =Studying English= The closing down of the university system led Chang, like most of her generation, away from the political maelstroms of the academy. Instead, she spent several years as a peasant, a barefoot doctor (a part-time peasant doctor), a steelworker and an electrician, though she received no formal training because of Mao's policy, which did not require formal instruction as a prerequisite for such work. The universities were eventually re-opened and she gained a place at Sichuan University to study English, later becoming an assistant lecturer there. After Mao's death, she passed an exam which allowed her to study in the West, and her application to leave China was approved once her father was politically rehabilitated. Life in Britain =Academic background= Chang left China in 1978 to study in Britain on a government scholarship, staying first in London. She later moved to Yorkshire, studying linguistics at the University of York with a scholarship from the university itself, living in Derwent College. She received her PhD in linguistics from York in 1982, becoming the first person from the People's Republic of China to be awarded a PhD from a British university. In 1986, she and Jon Halliday published Mme Sun Yat-sen (Soong Ching-ling), a biography of Sun Yat-Sen's widow. She has also been awarded honorary doctorates from the University of Buckingham, the University of York, the University of Warwick, Dundee University, Bowdoin College (USA), and the Open University. She lectured for some time at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, before leaving in the 1990s to concentrate on her writing. =New experiences= In 2003, Jung Chang wrote a new foreword to Wild Swans, describing her early life in Britain and explaining why she wrote the book. Having lived in China during the 1960s and 1970s, she found Britain exciting and loved the country, especially its diverse range of culture, literature and arts. She found even colourful window-boxes worth writing home about ‚Äì Hyde Park and the Kew Gardens were inspiring. She took every opportunity to watch Shakespeare's plays in both London and York. However she still has a special place for China in her heart, saying in an interview with HarperCollins, \\"I feel perhaps my heart is still in China\\". Chang lives in west London with her husband, the Irish historian Jon Halliday, who specialises in history of Asia. She was able to visit mainland China to see her family, with permission from the Chinese authorities, despite the fact that all her books are banned. =Celebrity= The publication of Jung Chang's second book Wild Swans made her a celebrity. Chang's unique style, using a personal description of the life of three generations of Chinese women to highlight the many changes that the country went through, proved to be highly successful. Large numbers of sales were generated, and the book's popularity led to its being sold around the world and translated into nearly 40 languages. Chang became a popular figure for talks about Communist China; and she has travelled across Britain, Europe, America, and many other places in the world. She returned to the University of York on 14 June 2005, to address the university's debating union and spoke to an audience of over 300, most of whom were students.Record crowd for Jung Chang, The Union ‚Äì The York Union (25 June 2005) The BBC invited her onto the panel of Question Time for a first- ever broadcast from Shanghai on 10 March 2005, but she was unable to attend when she broke her leg a few days beforehand. Publications =Wild Swans= The international best-seller is a biography of three generations of Chinese women in 20th century China ‚Äì her grandmother, mother, and herself. Chang paints a vivid portrait of the political and military turmoil of China in this period, from the marriage of her grandmother to a warlord, to her mother's experience of Japanese-occupied Jinzhou during the Second Sino- Japanese War, and her own experience of the effects of Mao's policies of the 1950s and 1960s. Wild Swans was translated into 38 languages and sold 20 million copies, receiving praise from authors such as J. G. Ballard. It is banned in mainland China, though many pirated versions circulated, as are translations in Hong Kong and Taiwan. =Mao: The Unknown Story= Chang's 2005 work, a biography of Mao, was co-authored with her husband Jon Halliday and portrays Mao in an extremely negative light. The couple traveled all over the world to research the book, which took 12 years to write. They interviewed hundreds of people who had known Mao, including George H. W. Bush, Henry Kissinger, and Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama. Kissinger called it \\"grotesque in that it depicts Mao as a man without any qualities.\\"Kissinger interview, Die Welt, 27 December 2005 Later, he described it in his book On China as \\"one-sided but often thought-provoking.\\" Kissinger, \\"On China\\", p. 158 Among their criticisms of Mao, Chang and Halliday argue that despite his having been born into a relatively rich peasant family, he had little well-informed concern for the long-term welfare of the Chinese peasantry. They hold Mao responsible for the famine resulting from the Great Leap Forward and state that he had created the famine by exporting food when China had insufficient grain to feed its own people. They also write that Mao had arranged for the arrests and murders of many of his political opponents, including some of his personal friends, and they argue that he was a far more tyrannical leader than had previously been thought. Mao: The Unknown Story became a best-seller, with UK sales alone reaching 60,000 in six months. Academics and commentators wrote reviews ranging from praise to criticism. Professor Richard Baum said that it had to be \\"taken very seriously as the most thoroughly researched and richly documented piece of synthetic scholarship\\" on Mao. On the other hand, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that while few commentators \\"disput[ed] the subject,\\" \\"some of the world's most eminent scholars of modern Chinese history\\" had referred to the book as \\"a gross distortion of the records.\\" =Empress Dowager Cixi= In October 2013, Chang published a biography of Empress Dowager Cixi, who led China from 1861 until her death in 1908. Chang argues that Cixi has been \\"deemed either tyrannical and vicious, or hopelessly incompetent‚Äîor both,\\" and that this view is both simplistic and inaccurate. Chang portrays her as intelligent, open-minded, and a proto-feminist limited by a xenophobic and deeply conservative imperial bureaucracy. Although Cixi is often accused of reactionary conservatism (especially for her treatment of the Guangxu Emperor during and after the Hundred Days' Reform), Chang demonstrates that Cixi actually started the Reforms and \\"brought medieval China into the modern age.\\"Schell, Orville. \\"Her Dynasty.\\" New York Times. 25 October 2013. Accessed 25 October 2013. Newspaper reviews have also been positive in their assessment. Te-Ping Chen, writing in the Wall Street Journal, found the book \\"packed with details that bring to life its central character.\\"Chen, Te- Ping.\\"Jung Chang Rewrites Empress Cixi.\\" Wall Street Journal. 3 October 2013. Accessed 3 November 2013. Simon Sebag Montefiore writes: \\"Filled with new revelations, it‚Äôs a gripping and surprising story of an extraordinary woman in power. Using Chinese sources, totally untapped by western books, this reappraises one of the great monstresses of modern history‚Ä¶ Jung Chang‚Äôs revisionism means that this book reveals a new and different woman: ambitious, sometimes murderous, but pragmatic and unique. All of this adds up to make Empress Dowager Cixi a powerful read.\\" Simon Sebag Montefiore , BBC History Magazine The book also received critical treatment in the academic world. The Qing dynasty specialist Pamela Kyle Crossley wrote a skeptical review in the London Review of Books. \\"Chang has made impressive use of the rapidly expanding range of published material from the imperial archives. But understanding these sources requires profound study of the context. [...] Her claims regarding Cixi‚Äôs importance seem to be minted from her own musings, and have little to do with what we know was actually going in China. I am as eager as anyone to see more attention paid to women of historical significance. But rewriting Cixi as Catherine the Great or Margaret Thatcher is a poor bargain: the gain of an illusory icon at the expense of historical sense.\\" .Crossley, Pamela, \\"In the hornet's nest\\", London Review of Books¬∑ 17 April 2014 In the New York Times, Orville Schell called the biography \\"a truly authoritative account of Cixi‚Äôs rule,\\" New York Times, 25 October 2013 and the paper named it one of its 'Notable Books of the Year'New York Times, 2013 =List of works= *Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Madame Sun Yat-sen: Soong Ching-ling (London, 1986); Penguin, *Jung Chang, Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China (London, 1992); 2004 Harper Perennial ed. *Jung Chang, Lynn Pan and Henry Zhao (edited by Jessie Lim and Li Yan), Another province: new Chinese writing from London (London, 1994); Lambeth Chinese Community Association, . *Jung Chang and Jon Halliday, Mao: The Unknown Story (London, 2005); Jonathan Cape, *Jung Chang, Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China (Alfred A.

Konvas () is the general name of portable 35mm motion-picture cameras that was manufactured in the USSR by KMZ (KRASNOGORSKIY MEKHANICHESKIY ZAVOD ‚Äì Krasnogorsk Mechanical Works), known as ZENIT camera makers, and later on, MOSKINAP (MOSKOVSKIY ZAVOD KINOAPPARATURIY ‚Äì Moscow Works of Cinema Equipment (The holder of the Order of the Badge of Honour ‚Äì –û—Ä–¥–µ–Ω ¬´–ó–Ω–∞–∫ –ü–æ—á–µ—Ç–∞¬ª), at one time in the late 80's had over 2,000 employees; now OAO \\"MOSKINAP\\", and for a short period at the same factory after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The factory was manufacturing Laser soundheads, and 35mm sound projectors originally were made by Odessa PO KINAP some time ago. The camera line is no longer made, although many working models are still circulating at reasonable prices worldwide. The name \\"Konvas\\" is a portmanteau that comes from the first three letters of the last and first name of the camera's designer, KONSTANTINOV VASILY (). Later renamed to Konvas-Avtomat (Automatic) for electric-driven models. Initially, the camera was used widely by fiction, documentary, and news cameramen throughout the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. The relatively small size of Konvas cameras and its low price (it often sells for almost the same price as the more primitive, older Bell & Howell Eyemo) makes it popular with independent filmmakers throughout the world to this day. There are very good and useful modifications for these cameras these days. You might be surprised for some prices, but its functionality is much more valuable than its price always. Konvas cameras are reflex, using a spinning mirrored shutter, allowing the operator to view the scene through the main lens during filming. Because of the camera's movement mechanism, the shutter opening is 155¬∞ as opposed to the 180¬∞ which is standard on many other cameras. Consequently, the shutter speed is slightly higher, for which the exposure must be compensated from the usual 24fps frames per second light meter setting by 1/3 of an f/stop. It has an extended dwell time for film transport like in ARRI 35 series, thus provides more steadiness despite it has no register pin. Some models including ‚àí2M and 8M accept a single OCT-19 mount lens, others have a three lens turret including ‚àí1M and 7M. All Konvas cameras accept a 60-meter (slightly less than 200 ft) load of film via a detachable camera magazine, some also accept a 120-meter (roughly 400 ft) detachable magazine.

XIII and it is located within the Municipio I. Its name comes from the Latin trans Tiberim, meaning literally \\"beyond the Tiber\\". Its coat of arms depicts a golden head of a lion on a red background, the meaning of which is uncertain. History Rome's First Synagogue A typical narrow alley in Trastevere seen from the lower slopes of the Gianicolo hill Santa Maria in Trastevere at night In Rome's Regal period (753‚Äì509 BC), the area across the Tiber belonged to the hostile Etruscans: the Romans named it Ripa Etrusca (Etruscan bank). Rome conquered it to gain control of and access to the river from both banks, but was not interested in building on that side of the river. In fact, the only connection between Trastevere and the rest of the city was a small wooden bridge called the Pons Sublicius (Latin: \\"bridge built on wooden piles\\"). By the time of the Republic c. 509 BC, the number of sailors and fishermen making a living from the river had increased, and many had taken up residence in Trastevere. Immigrants from the East also settled there, mainly Jews and Syrians. The area began to be considered part of the city under Augustus, who divided Rome into 14 regions (regiones in Latin); modern Trastevere was the XIV and was called Trans Tiberim. Since the end of the Roman Republic the quarter was also the center of an important Jewish community, which lived there until the end of the Middle Ages. Rome's oldest remaining synagogue, though not used as such any longer, is found in the district. The building was constructed in 980, and became a synagogue in 1073 through the efforts of lexicographer Nathan ben Yechiel. Within the building there was also a mikveh. At the base of the central column Hebrew writing is still visible. Its use as a synagogue ended when the Jews were forced to move to the Roman ghetto on the other side of the Tiber river in the mid-16th century. It is now used commercially, and can be found at 14, Vicolo dell‚ÄôAtleta. With the wealth of the Imperial Age, several important figures decided to build their villae in Trastevere, including Clodia, (Catullus' \\"friend\\") and Julius Caesar (his garden villa, the Horti Caesaris). The regio included two of the most ancient churches in Rome, the Titulus Callixti, later called the Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere, and the Titulus Cecilae, Santa Cecilia in Trastevere. In order to have a stronghold on the right Bank and to control the Gianicolo hill, Transtiberim was partially included by Emperor Aurelian (270‚Äì275) inside the wall erected to defend the city against the Germanic tribes. In the Middle Ages Trastevere had narrow, winding, irregular streets; moreover, because of the mignani (structures on the front of buildings) there was no space for carriages to pass. At the end of the 15th century these mignani were removed. Nevertheless, Trastevere remained a maze of narrow streets. There was a strong contrast between the large, opulent houses of the upper classes and the small, dilapidated houses of the poor. The streets had no pavement until the time of Sixtus IV at the end of the 15th century. At first bricks were used, but these were later replaced by sampietrini (cobble stones), which were more suitable for carriages. Thanks to its partial isolation (it was \\"beyond the Tiber\\") and to the fact that its population had been multicultural since the ancient Roman period, the inhabitants of Trastevere, called Trasteverini, developed a culture of their own. In 1744 Benedict XIV modified the borders of the rioni, giving Trastevere its modern limits.  Modern day Nowadays, Trastevere maintains its character thanks to its narrow cobbled streets lined by ancient houses. At night, natives and tourists alike flock to its many pubs and restaurants, but much of the original character of Trastevere remains. The area is also home to several foreign academic institutions including The American University of Rome and John Cabot University (both of which are private American universities), the American Academy in Rome, the Rome campus of the Thomas More College of Liberal Arts, the Canadian University of Waterloo School of Architecture (between the months of September and December), and the American Pratt Institute School of Architecture therefore serving as home to an international student body. The neighborhood has attracted artists, foreign expats, and many famous people. In the sixties and seventies, the American musicians/composers Frederic Rzewski and Richard Teitelbaum, of the group Musica Elettronica Viva, lived in Via della Luce. Sergio Leone, the director of Spaghetti Westerns, grew up in Viale Glorioso (there is a marble plaque to his memory on the wall of the apartment building), and went to a Catholic private school in the neighborhood. Ennio Morricone, the film music composer, went to the same school, and for one year was in the same class as Sergio Leone.  Geography  The rione is on the west bank of the River Tiber, south of Vatican City, in the plain between the meander of the river and the Janiculum Hill. In addition to the river, that marks the eastern border of the borough, the area is delimited to the west and to the south by the Janiculum walls, and to the north by the Galleria Principe Amedeo di Savoia-Aosta tunnel. =Boundaries= To the north, Trastevere borders with Borgo (R. XVI), whose border is defined by a portion of the Aurelian Walls, beside Rampa del Sangallo and Viale delle Mura Aurelie, by Piazza della Rovere and by Ponte Principe Amedeo. To the east, the rione borders with Ponte (R. V), Regola (R. VII) and Ripa (R. XII): the border is marked by the stretch of the Tiber between Ponte Principe Amedeo and Ponte Sublicio. To the south, Trastevere borders with Quartiere Portuense (Q. XI), from which is separated by a short stretch of the Aurelian Walls beside Piazza di Porta Portese; as well as with Quartiere Aurelio (Q. XIII), from which is separated by the stretch of the Walls between Porta Portese and Porta San Pancrazio. Westward, it borders with Quartiere Gianicolense (Q. XII), whose boundary is marked by the Aurelian Walls, alongside Viale delle Mura Aurelie.

One of his most influential works was the comprehensive astronomical treatise Tantrasamgraha completed in 1501. He had also composed an elaborate commentary on Aryabhatiya called the Aryabhatiya Bhasya. In this Bhasya, Nilakantha had discussed infinite series expansions of trigonometric functions and problems of algebra and spherical geometry. Grahapareeksakrama is a manual on making observations in astronomy based on instruments of the time. Known popularly as Kelallur Chomaathiri, he is considered an equal to Vatasseri Parameshwaran Nambudiri. Biographical details Nilakantha Somayaji was one of the very few authors of the scholarly traditions of India who had cared to record details about his own life and times.Tantrasamgraha, ed. K.V. Sarma, trans. V. S. Narasimhan in the Indian Journal of History of Science, issue starting Vol. 33, No. 1 of March 1998 In one of his works titled Siddhanta-star and also in his own commentary on Siddhanta-darpana, Nilakantha Somayaji has stated that he was born on Kali-day 1,660,181 which works out to 14 June 1444 CE. A contemporary reference to Nilakantha Somayaji in a Malayalam work on astrology implies that Somayaji lived to a ripe old age even to become a centenarian. Sankara Variar, a pupil of Nilakantha Somayaji, in his commentary on Tantrasamgraha titled Tantrasamgraha-vyakhya, points out that the first and last verses of Tantrasamgraha contain chronograms specifying the Kali-days of the commencement (1,680,548) and of completion (1,680,553) of Somayaji's magnum opus Tantrasamgraha. Both these days occur in 1500 CE. In Aryabhatiya-bhashya, Nilakantha Somayaji has stated that he was the son of Jatavedas and he had a brother named Sankara. Somayaji has further stated that he was a Bhatta belonging to the Gargya gotra and was a follower of Asvalayana-sutra of Rigveda. References in his own Laghuramayana indicate that Nilakantha Somayaji was a member of the Kelallur family (Sanskritised as Kerala-sad-grama) residing at Kundagrama, now known as Trikkandiyur in modern Tirur, Kerala. His wife was named Arya and he had two sons Rama and Dakshinamurti. Nilakantha Somayaji studied vedanta and some aspects of astronomy under one Ravi. However, it was Damodara, son of Kerala-drgganita author Paramesvara, who initiated him into the science of astronomy and instructed him in the basic principles of mathematical computations. The great Malayalam poet Thunchaththu Ramanujan Ezhuthachan is said to have been a student of Nilakantha Somayaji. The epithet Somayaji is a title assigned to or assumed by a Namputiri who has performed the vedic ritual of Somayajna. So it could be surmised that Nilakantha Somayaji had also performed a Somayajna ritual and assumed the title of a Somayaji in later life. In colloquial Malayalam usage the word Somayaji has been corrupted to Comatiri. Nilakantha Somayaji as a polymath  Nilakantha's writings substantiate his knowledge of several branches of Indian philosophy and culture. It is said that he could refer to a Mimamsa authority to establish his view-point in a debate and with equal felicity apply a grammatical dictum to the same purpose. In his writings he refers to a Mimamsa authority, quotes extensively from Pingala's chandas-sutra, scriptures, Dharmasastras, Bhagavata and Vishnupurana also. Sundararaja, a contemporary Tamil astronomer, refers to Nilakantha as sad-darshani-parangata, one who had mastered the six systems of Indian philosophy. Astronomy In his Tantrasangraha, Nilakantha revised Aryabhata's model for the planets Mercury and Venus. His equation of the centre for these planets remained the most accurate until the time of Johannes Kepler in the 17th century.George G. Joseph (2000). The Crest of the Peacock: Non-European Roots of Mathematics, p. 408. Princeton University Press. In his Aryabhatiyabhasya, a commentary on Aryabhata's Aryabhatiya, Nilakantha developed a computational system for a partially heliocentric planetary model in which Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the Tychonic system later proposed by Tycho Brahe in the late 16th century. Most astronomers of the Kerala school who followed him accepted this planetary model.K. Ramasubramanian, M. D. Srinivas, M. S. Sriram (1994). \\"Modification of the earlier Indian planetary theory by the Kerala astronomers (c. 1500 AD) and the implied heliocentric picture of planetary motion\\", Current Science 66, p. 784-790.

These machines are also often called \\"imagers\\" in the industry. A microfilmer is a camera that is used to photograph documents to create a more compact and permanent record of the original in the form of roll-film or microfiche. Once the information contained on a paper document has been recorded onto microfilm, the information can be viewed later on a microfilm reader or viewer, or reproduced in paper form on a microfilm reader-printer. Banking and insurance companies often convert their paper records using microfilmers. Libraries often keep newspapers and magazines which have been converted to roll-film or microfiche form using microfilmers. Microfilmers are often used to preserve government records. Many companies have switched from microfilm to digital imaging systems, which offer more convenient computer retrieval of records. Microfilmers come in two basic configurations: planetary and rotary. A planetary microfilmer takes a snapshot of a stationary document held on a flat surface. While the picture is being taken, the film and the document do not move. In a rotary microfilmer, both the document and the film are moving in sync with one another while the picture is being taken. This allows for quicker filming of the document. Planetary microfilmers typically offer higher image resolution than rotary filmers, and can more readily film larger documents, as well as odd-shaped documents, such as books. In the 1951 film When Worlds Collide, a roomful of planetary filmers and their operators are shown as they race against time to preserve crucial books for survivors of a doomed Earth.

Written by Margaret Armen and directed by Jud Taylor, it was first broadcast October 4, 1968. In the episode, an alien device on a primitive planet erases Captain Kirk's memory, and he begins a new life with the planet's indigenous people modeled on Native Americans. Plot Captain Kirk, First Officer Spock and Chief Medical Officer Dr. McCoy transport to the surface of an Earth-like planet, from which they are to deflect an approaching asteroid. They discover an obelisk with strange markings, and observe a settlement whose inhabitants, according to Spock, are descended from Native Americans. Kirk, while out of sight of the others, falls through a trap door into the obelisk, where a beam shocks him into unconsciousness. Spock and McCoy are unable to locate Kirk and return to the Federation starship USS Enterprise to complete their mission. Kirk awakens with amnesia, and a pair of women, including Miramanee, the tribal priestess, see Kirk emerge from their \\"temple.\\" He is hailed as a god, and taken back to their village, where the tribal elders demand proof of Kirk's divinity. At that moment, a drowned boy is brought in. Salish, the medicine chief, declares the child dead, but Kirk uses mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to revive him. The elders accept Kirk as a god, forcing Salish to relinquish his position to Kirk. In the meantime Spock, taking command of the Enterprise, rushes at maximum warp speed to meet the approaching asteroid. However, having pushed the energy and propulsion systems beyond their normal limits, there is not much energy left to deflect the asteroid. Attempts result in a change of 0.0013 degrees in its course, which the crew deems insufficient to avoid collision with the planet. Having exhausted their options, the Enterprise begins a slower travel back to the planet to attempt to rescue people ahead of the asteroid impact. Following the tradition that the tribe priestess and medicine chief marry, Miramanee rejects Salish for Kirk. Meanwhile, the Enterprise crew intercept the asteroid, but fail to deflect or destroy it. Spock orders the ship to shadow the asteroid back to the planet. Kirk falls deeper in love with Miramanee, though haunted at night by dreams of people he feels he should be with. Miramanee happily tells Kirk that she is pregnant. As the Enterprise nears the planet, Spock succeeds in partially deciphering the markings on the obelisk. It is an asteroid deflector built by the \\"Preservers\\", an ancient race that resettled various endangered humanoid populations on other planets in order to ensure their survival. Spock surmises that the obelisk has malfunctioned. As the asteroid nears the planet, the sky darkens, thunder roars and strong winds blow, and the elders tell Kirk he must go into the temple to stop the storm. As Kirk pounds fruitlessly on the side of the obelisk, the tribe turns against him, then begin stoning him and Miramanee. Spock and McCoy materialize, frightening the villagers away. Spock uses a mind meld to retrieve Kirk's memories, while McCoy tends to Miramanee's wounds. Kirk is able to open the trap door and Spock activates the deflector with minutes to spare. McCoy tells Kirk that Miramanee will not survive. Production and reception According to author Daniel Leonard Bernardi, \\"'The Paradise Syndrome\\" stereotypes Native Americans as noble savages and whites as 'normal' and even divine [...] Miramanee cannot figure out how to pull Kirk's shirt off, as she cannot find any lacing. She is portrayed as simpleminded, not that bright-- according to Bernardi. This is not the case with Kirk. Moments before, he has fashioned a lamp from an old piece of pottery and saved a boy by using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Despite his amnesia, he is shown as \\"naturally superior\\" [...] When the aliens realize that Kirk is not a god, they stone both him and Miramanee (it's the local citizens who are violent in this version of the noble savage stereotype). Spock and McCoy eventually intervene, but only Kirk survives. In this take on a standard white/red miscegenation narrative, the native girl dies so that Kirk, the white male hero, isn't shown unheroically and immorally leaving her and their unborn baby behind.\\" Star Trek and History: Race-ing Toward a White Future, pp 44, 49 In 2015, Wired magazine suggested this episode was skippable in their binge-watching guide for the original series.

He is regarded as the reviver of the Rinzai school from a moribund period of stagnation, refocusing it on its traditionally rigorous training methods integrating meditation and koan practice. Biography =Early years= Hakuin was born in 1686 in the small village of Hara,Shoinji Temple at the foot of Mount Fuji. His mother was a devout Nichiren Buddhist, and it is likely that her piety was a major influence on his decision to become a Buddhist monk. As a child, Hakuin attended a lecture by a Nichiren monk on the topic of the Eight Hot Hells. This deeply impressed the young Hakuin, and he developed a pressing fear of hell, seeking a way to escape it. He eventually came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to become a monk. Sh≈çin- ji and Daish≈ç-ji At the age of fifteen, he obtained consent from his parents to join the monastic life, and was ordained at the local Zen temple, Sh≈çin-ji. When the head monk at Sh≈çin-ji took ill, Hakuin was sent to a neighboring temple, Daish≈ç-ji, where he served as a novice for three or four years, studying Buddhist texts. While at Daisho-ji, he read the Lotus Sutra, considered by the Nichiren sect to be the king of all Buddhist sutras, and found it disappointing, saying \\"it consisted of nothing more than simple tales about cause and effect\\". Zens≈ç-ji At age eighteen, he left Daish≈ç-ji for Zens≈ç-ji, a temple close to Hara. At the age of nineteen, he came across in his studies the story of the Chinese Ch'an master Yantou Quanhuo, who had been brutally murdered by bandits. Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. How then could he, just a simple monk, hope to be saved from the tortures of hell in the next life? He gave up his goal of becoming an enlightened monk, and not wanting to return home in shame, traveled around studying literature and poetry. Zuiun-ji Travelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin made his way to Zuiun-ji, the residence of Ba≈ç R≈çjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher. While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience that put him back along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the Dharma to help him choose a path. He then reached out and took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the Ming Dynasty. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen. =First awakening= Eigen-ji He again went traveling for two years, settling down at the Eigen-ji temple when he was twenty-three. It was here that Hakuin had his first entrance into enlightenment when he was twenty-four. He locked himself away in a shrine in the temple for seven days, and eventually reached an intense awakening upon hearing the ringing of the temple bell. However, his master refused to acknowledge this enlightenment, and Hakuin left the temple. Hakuin Ekaku Sh≈çju R≈çjin Hakuin left again, to study for a mere eight months with Sh≈çju R≈çjin (Dokyu Etan, 1642‚Äì1721). Shoju was an intensely demanding teacher, who hurled insults and blows at Hakuin, in an attempt to free him from his limited understanding and self-centeredness. When asked why he had become a monk, Hakuin said that it was out of terror to fall into hell, to which Sh≈çju replied \\"You're a self-centered rascal, aren't you!\\" Sh≈çju assigned him a series of \\"hard-to-pass\\" koans. These led to three isolated moments of satori, but it was only eighteen years later that Hakuin really understood what Sh≈çju meant with this. Hakuin left Shoju after eight months of study, without receiving formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin, nor from any other teacher,James Ford (2009), Teaching Credentials in Zen but Hakuin considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin. Today Hakuin is considered to have received dharma transmission from Shoju.Zen Buddhism: from perspective of Japanese Soto & Rinzai Zen Schools Taigi - great doubt Hakuin realized that his attainment was incomplete. He was unable to sustain the tranquility of mind of the Zen hall in the midst of daily life. When he was twenty-six he read that \\"all wise men and eminent priests who lack the Bodhi- mind fall into Hell\\". This raised a \\"great doubt\\" (taigi) in him, since he thought that the formal entrance into monkhood and the daily enactment of rituals was the bodhi-mind. Only with his final awakening, at age 42, did he fully realize what \\"bodhi-mind\\" means, namely working for the good of others. Zen sickness Hakuin's early extreme exertions affected his health, and at one point in his young life he fell ill for almost two years, experiencing what would now probably be classified as a nervous breakdown by Western medicine. He called it Zen sickness, and sought the advice of a Taoist cave dwelling hermit named Hakuyu, who prescribed a visualization and breathing practice which eventually relieved his symptoms. From this point on, Hakuin put a great deal of importance on physical strength and health in his Zen practice, and studying Hakuin-style Zen required a great deal of stamina. Hakuin often spoke of strengthening the body by concentrating the spirit, and followed this advice himself. Well into his seventies, he claimed to have more physical strength than he had at age thirty, being able to sit in zazen meditation or chant sutras for an entire day without fatigue. The practices Hakuin learned from Hakuyu are still passed down within the Rinzai school. =Head priest at Sh≈çin-ji= After another several years of travel, at age 31 Hakuin returned to Shoin-ji, the temple where he had been ordained. He was soon installed as head priest, a capacity in which he would serve for the next half-century. When he was installed as head priest of Sh≈çin-ji in 1718, he had the title of Dai-ichiza, \\"First Monk\\": It was around this time that he adopted the name \\"Hakuin\\", which means \\"concealed in white\\", referring to the state of being hidden in the clouds and snow of mount Fuji. Final awakening Although Hakuin had several \\"satori experiences\\", he did not feel free, and was unable to integrate his realization into his ordinary life. At age 41, he experienced a final and total awakening, while reading the Lotus Sutra, the sutra that he had disregarded as a young student. He realized that the Bodhi- mind means working for the good of every sentient being: He wrote of this experience, saying \\"suddenly I penetrated to the perfect, true, ultimate meaning of the Lotus\\". This event marked a turning point in Hakuin's life. He dedicated the rest of his life to helping others achieve liberation. Practicing the bodhi-mind He would spend the next forty years teaching at Shoin-ji, writing, and giving lectures. At first there were only a few monks there, but soon word spread, and Zen students began to come from all over the country to study with Hakuin. Eventually, an entire community of monks had built up in Hara and the surrounding areas, and Hakuin's students numbered in the hundreds. He eventually would certify over eighty disciples as successors. Is that so? A well-known anecdote took place in this period: =Death= At the age of 83, Hakuin died in Hara, the same village in which he was born and which he had transformed into a center of Zen teaching. Teachings Daruma by Hakuin =Post-satori practice= Hakuin saw \\"deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere\\" as an indispensable part of the Buddhist path to awakening. Hakuin emphasized the need for \\"post-satori training\\", purifying the mind of karmic tendencies and The insight in the need of arousing bodhicitta formed Hakuin's final awakening: =Koan practice= Hakuin deeply believed that the most effective way for a student to achieve insight was through extensive meditation on a koan. Only with incessant investigation of his koan will a student be able to become one with the koan, and attain enlightenment. The psychological pressure and doubt that comes when one struggles with a koan is meant to create tension that leads to awakening. Hakuin called this the \\"great doubt\\", writing, \\"At the bottom of great doubt lies great awakening. If you doubt fully, you will awaken fully\\". Hakuin used a fivefold classification system: 1\\\\. Hosshin, dharma-body koans, are used to awaken the first insight into sunyata. They reveal the dharmakaya, or Fundamental. They introduce \\"the undifferentiated and the unconditional\\". 2\\\\. Kikan, dynamic action koans, help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view; Where hosshin koans represent tai, substance, kikan koans represent yu, function. 3\\\\. Gonsen, explication of word koans, aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters. They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words. 4\\\\. Hachi Nanto, eight \\"difficult to pass\\" koans. There are various explanations for this category, one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through satori. It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans. Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten hachi nanto koans. 5\\\\. Goi jujukin koans, the Five Ranks of Tozan and the Ten Grave Precepts. Hakuin's emphasis on koan practice had a strong influence in the Japanese Rinzai-school. In the system developed by his followers, students are assigned koans by their teacher and then meditate on them. Once they have broken through, they must demonstrate their insight in private interview with the teacher. If the teacher feels the student has indeed attained a satisfactory insight into the koan, then another is assigned. Hakuin's main role in the development of this koan system was most likely the selection and creation of koans to be used. In this he didn't limit himself to the classic koan collections inherited from China; he himself originated one of the best-known koans, \\"You know the sound of two hands clapping; tell me, what is the sound of one hand?\\". Hakuin preferred this new koan to the most commonly assigned first koan from the Chinese tradition, the Mu koan. He believed his \\"Sound of One Hand\\" to be more effective in generating the great doubt, and remarked that \\"its superiority to the former methods is like the difference between cloud and mud\\". =Four ways of knowing= Asanga, one of the main proponents of Yogacara, introduced the idea of four ways of knowing: the perfection of action, observing knowing, universal knowing, and great mirror knowing. He relates these to the Eight Consciousnesses: # The five senses are connected to the perfection of action, # Samjna (cognition) is connected to observing knowing, # Manas (mind) is related to universal knowing, # Alaya-vijnana is connected to great mirror knowing. In time, these ways of knowing were also connected to the doctrine of the three bodies of the Buddha (DharmakƒÅya, SambhogakƒÅya and Nirmanakaya), together forming the \\"Yuishiki doctrine\\". Hakuin related these four ways of knowing to four gates on the Buddhist path: the Gate of Inspiration, the Gate of Practice, the Gate of Awakening, and the Gate of Nirvana. # The Gate of Inspiration is initial awakening, kensho, seeing into one's true nature. # The Gate of Practice is the purification of oneself by continuous practice. # The Gate of Awakening is the study of the ancient masters and the Buddhist sutras, to deepen the insight into the Buddhist teachings, and acquire the skills needed to help other sentient beings on the Buddhist path to awakening. # The Gate of Nirvana is the \\"ultimate liberation\\", \\"knowing without any kind of defilement\\". =Opposition to \\"Do-nothing Zen\\"= One of Hakuin's major concerns was the danger of what he called \\"Do-nothing Zen\\" teachers, who upon reaching some small experience of enlightenment devoted the rest of their life to, as he puts it, \\"passing day after day in a state of seated sleep\\". Quietist practices seeking simply to empty the mind, or teachers who taught that a tranquil \\"emptiness\\" was enlightenment, were Hakuin's constant targets. In this regard he was especially critical of followers of the maverick Zen master Bankei. He stressed a never-ending and severe training to deepen the insight of enlightenment and forge one's ability to manifest it in all activities. He urged his students to never be satisfied with shallow attainments, and truly believed that enlightenment was possible for anyone if they exerted themselves and approached their practice with real energy. =Lay teachings= An extremely well known and popular Zen master during his later life, Hakuin was a firm believer in bringing the wisdom of Zen to all people. Thanks to his upbringing as a commoner and his many travels around the country, he was able to relate to the rural population, and served as a sort of spiritual father to the people in the areas surrounding Shoin-ji. In fact, he turned down offers to serve in the great monasteries in Kyoto, preferring to stay at Shoin-ji. Most of his instruction to the common people focused on living a morally virtuous life. Showing a surprising broad-mindedness, his ethical teachings drew on elements from Confucianism, ancient Japanese traditions, and traditional Buddhist teachings. He also never sought to stop the rural population from observing non-Zen traditions, despite the seeming intolerance for other schools' practices in his writings. In addition to this, Hakuin was also a popular Zen lecturer, traveling all over the country, often to Kyoto, to teach and speak on Zen. He wrote frequently in the last fifteen years of his life, trying to record his lessons and experiences for posterity. Much of his writing was in the vernacular, and in popular forms of poetry that commoners would read. =Calligraphy= An important part of Hakuin's practice of Zen was his painting and calligraphy. He seriously took up painting only late in his life, at almost age sixty, but is recognized as one of the greatest Japanese Zen painters. His paintings were meant to capture Zen values, serving as sorts of \\"visual sermons\\" that were extremely popular among the laypeople of the time, many of whom were illiterate. Today, paintings of Bodhi Dharma by Hakuin Ekaku are sought after and displayed in a handful of the world's leading museums. Influence Through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are part of the ≈åt≈çkan lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by Nanpo Jomyo, who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.Rinzai- Obaku Zen - What is Zen? - History All contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751‚Äì1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760‚Äì1833), both students of Gasan Jito (1727‚Äì1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though \\"he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs\\". Writings Hakuin left a voluminous body of works, divided in Dharma Works (14 vols.) and Kanbun Works (4 vols.).The Hakuin Study Group has been researching the written works of Hakuin.

He was famous both for his motets, which are among the most refined of the time, and for being the teacher of Adrian Willaert, one of the founders of the Venetian School.  Life  He was born Jean de Hollingue either in 1459 or earlier, but records of his early life, as is so often the case with Renaissance composers, are scant. Most likely he was from the village of Haut-Wignes (now Wirwignes), near Boulogne-sur-Mer, in Samer. He probably began his first job, singer and teacher at the collegiate church in Saint Omer, then moved to Nesle (southeast of Amiens) in 1477, and in 1483 was made ma√Ætre de chapelle there. Sometime around this time he became a priest, and in 1500 he was in charge of choirboys at the cathedral in Amiens. In 1501 he was in Grenoble, teaching choirboys, but he left the next year, most likely entering the service of Queen Anne of Brittany, and in 1509 he was granted a position again in Grenoble which he could hold in absentia. Mouton was now the principal composer for the French court. For the remainder of his life he was employed by the French court in one capacity or another, often writing music for state occasions‚Äîweddings, coronations, papal elections, births and deaths. Mouton composed a motet, Christus vincit, for the election of Leo X as pope in 1513. Leo evidently liked Mouton's music, for he rewarded him with the honorary title, apostolic notaryhttps://www.findagrave.com/memorial/20497566# on the occasion of a motet he composed for the pope in 1515; the pope made this award during a meeting in Bologna between the French king and the pope after the Battle of Marignano. This trip to Italy was the first, and probably only trip that Mouton made outside France. Sometime between 1517 and 1522 the Swiss music theorist Heinrich Glarean met Mouton, and praised him effusively; he wrote that \\"everyone had copies of his music.\\" Glarean used several examples of Mouton's music in his influential treatise, the Dodecachordon. Mouton may have been the editor of the illuminated manuscript known as the Medici Codex, one of the primary manuscript sources of the time, which was a wedding gift for Lorenzo de' Medici. It is considered to be possible that Mouton was in charge of the elaborate musical festivities by the French at the meeting between Fran√ßois I and Henry VIII at the Field of the Cloth of Gold, based on the similarity to the festivities five years earlier after the Battle of Marignano. Near the end of his life, Mouton moved to Saint-Quentin. According to the engraving on his tombstone, he became a canon at the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, taking over for Loyset Comp√®re who died in 1518. Mouton died in Saint-Quentin and is buried there. The headstone, now missing, was engraved as follows: CI GIST MAISTRE JEAN DE HOLLINGUE, DIT MOUTON, EN SON VIVANT CHANTRE DU ROY CHANOINE DE THEROUANNE ET DE CETTE EGLISE QUI TRESPASSA LE PENULTIEME JOUR D'OCTOBRE MDXXII PRIEZ DIEU POUR SON AME  Music and influence  Mouton was hugely influential both as a composer and as a teacher. Of his music, 9 Magnificat settings, 15 masses, 20 chansons, and over 100 motets survive; since he was a court composer for a king, the survival rate of his music is relatively high for the period, it being widely distributed, copied, and archived. In addition, the famous publisher Ottaviano Petrucci printed an entire volume of Mouton's masses (early in the history of music printing, most publications contained works by multiple composers). The style of Mouton's music has superficial similarities to that of Josquin des Prez, using paired imitation, canonic techniques, and equal-voiced polyphonic writing: yet Mouton tends to write rhythmically and texturally uniform music compared to Josquin, with all the voices singing, and with relatively little textural contrast. Glarean characterized Mouton's melodic style with the phrase \\"his melody flows in a supple thread.\\" Around 1500, Mouton seems to have become more aware of chords and harmonic feeling, probably due to his encounter with Italian music. At any rate this was a period of transition between purely linear thinking in music, in which chords were incidental occurrences as a result of correct usage of intervals, and music in which the harmonic element was foremost (for example in lighter Italian forms such as the frottola, which are homophonic in texture and sometimes have frankly diatonic harmony). Mouton was a fine musical craftsman throughout his life, highly regarded by his contemporaries and much in demand by his royal patrons. His music was reprinted and continued to attract other composers even later in the 16th century, especially two joyful Christmas motets he wrote, Noe, noe psallite noe, and Quaeramus cum pastoribus, which several later composers used as the basis for masses. He also influenced posthumously the outstanding music theorist Gioseffo Zarlino, himself a pupil of Willaert, who referred to him, somewhat enthusiastically as his \\"precettore\\".Dimostrationi harmoniche Works list = Masses and mass fragments = # Missa \\"Alleluia Confitemini Domino\\" # Missa \\"Alma redemptoris mater\\" # Missa \\"Argentum et aurum (lost)\\" # Missa \\"Benedictus Dominus Deus\\" # Missa \\"Dictes moy toutes vos pens√©es\\" # Missa \\"Ecce quam bonum\\" # Missa \\"Lo serai je dire\\" # Missa \\"Faulte d'argent\\" # Missa \\"l'Homme arm√©\\" # Missa \\"Quem dicunt homines\\" # Missa \\"Regina mearum\\" # Missa \\"sans candence\\" # Missa sine nomine 1 (without a name) # Missa sine nomine 2 (without a name) # Missa \\"tu es Petrus\\" # Missa \\"Tua est potentia\\" # Missa \\"Verbum bonum\\" # Credo (fragment) = Motets (selected) = # Antequam comedam suspiro # Ave Maria - virgo serena for five voices, in two parts. # Benedicam Dominum # Exalta Regina Galliae (written to celebrate the French victory at the battle of Marignano, September 13‚Äì14, 1515) # Missus est Gabriel # Nesciens mater for eight voices, a tour de force of canon writing, being a quadruple canon at an interval of the fifth, proceeding a space of two measures. # Non nobis Domine (written for the birth of the Princess Ren√©e, October 25, 1510) # O Maria piissima; Quis dabit oculis nostris (on the death of Queen Anna, January 9, 1514) # Quaeramus cum pastoribus for four voices, in two parts. # Salve Mater Salvatoris . = Chansons (selected) = # La la la l'oysillon du bois # Qui ne regrettroit le gentil F√©vin (Deploration on the death of F√©vin, 1511-1512)  References  * Article \\"Jean Mouton,\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed.

Bley was a long-time resident of the United States. His music has been described by Ben Ratliff of the New York Times as \\"deeply original and aesthetically aggressive\\". Bley's prolific output includes influential recordings from the 1950s through to his solo piano records of the 2000s. Early life Bley was born in Montreal, Quebec, on November 10, 1932. His adoptive parents were Betty Marcovitch, an immigrant from Romania, and Joe Bley, owner of an embroidery factory.Bley Paul biography www.jazz.com However, in 1993 a relative from the New York branch of the Bley family walked into the Sweet Basil Jazz Club in New York City and informed him that his father was actually his biological parent. At age five Bley studied violin, but at age seven he decided to switch to the piano. By eleven he received a junior diploma from the McGill Conservatory in Montreal. At thirteen he formed a band which played at summer resorts in Ste. Agathe, Quebec. As a teenager he played with touring American bands, including Al Cowan's Tramp Band. In 1949, when Bley was starting his senior year of high school, Oscar Peterson asked Bley to fulfill his contract at the Alberta Lounge in Montreal. The next year Bley left Montreal for New York City and Juilliard.  1950s  In 1951, on a return trip to Montreal, Bley organized the Jazz Workshop with a group of Montreal musicians. In 1953 Bley invited the bebop alto saxophonist and composer Charlie Parker to the Jazz Workshop, where he played and recorded with him. When Bley returned to New York City he hired Jackie McLean, Al Levitt and Doug Watkins to play an extended gig at the Copa City on Long Island. From the early 1950s until 1960 Paul did a series of trios with Al Levitt and Peter Ind; recordings of this trio in 1954 were included in the Mercury album \\"Paul Bley\\". In 1953 the Shaw Agency booked Bley and his trio to tour with Lester Young, billed as \\"Lester Young and the Paul Bley Trio\\" in ads. He also performed with tenor saxophonist Ben Webster at that time. He then conducted for bassist Charles Mingus on the Charles Mingus and His Orchestra album. Additionally, in 1953, Mingus produced the Introducing Paul Bley album for his label, Debut Records with Mingus on bass and drummer Art Blakey. (In 1960 Bley recorded again with the Charles Mingus Group.) In 1954 Bley received a call from Chet Baker inviting him to play opposite Baker's quintet at Jazz City in Hollywood, California for the month of March. This was followed by a tour with singer Dakota Staton. Down Beat Magazine interviewed Bley for its July 13, 1955 issue. The prescient title of the article read, \\"PAUL BLEY, Jazz Is Just About Ready For Another Revolution\\". The article, reprinted in Down Beat's 50th Anniversary edition, quoted Bley as saying, \\"I'd like to write longer forms, I'd like to write music without a chordal center.\\" Bley's trio with Hal Gaylor and Lennie McBrowne toured across the US in 1956, including a club in Juarez. Mexico. The tour culminated with an invitation to play a 1956 New Year's Eve gig at Lucile Ball and Desi Arnez's home in Palm Springs. During the evening, Bley collapsed on the bandstand with a bleeding ulcer and Lucy immediately took him to the Palm Springs hospital where she proceeded to pay for all of his medical care. Bley, who had met Karen Borg while she was working as a cigarette girl at Birdland in NYC, married her after she came out to meet him in Los Angeles, where she became Carla Bley. In 1957 Bley stayed in Los Angeles where he had the house band at the Hillcrest Club. By 1958 the original band, with vibe player, Dave Pike, evolved into a quintet with Bley hiring young avant garde musicians trumpet player Don Cherry, alto saxophonist Ornette Coleman, bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Billy Higgins.  1960s  In the early 1960s Bley was part of a trio, with Giuffre on reeds, and Steve Swallow on bass. Its repertoire included compositions by Giuffre, Bley and his now ex-wife, composer Carla Bley. The group's music moved towards chamber jazz and free jazz. The 1961 European tour of The Giuffre 3 shocked a public expecting Bebop, however the many recordings released from this tour have proven to be classics of free jazz. During the same period, Bley was touring and recording with tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins, which culminated with the RCA Victor album Sonny Meets Hawk! with tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins. Bley's solo on \\"All The Things You Are\\" from this album has been called \\"the shot heard around the world\\" by Pat Metheny. In 1964 Bley was instrumental in the formation of the Jazz Composers Guild, a co-operative organization which brought together many free jazz musicians in New York: Bill Dixon, Roswell Rudd, Cecil Taylor, Archie Shepp, Carla Bley, Michael Mantler, Sun Ra, and others. The guild organized weekly concerts and created a forum for the \\"October Revolution\\" of 1964.Paul Bley with David Lee: Stopping Time. Paul Bley and the Transformation of Jazz, Vehicule Press, 1999. In the late 1960s, Bley pioneered the use of the Arp and Moog synthesizers, performing live before an audience for the first time at Philharmonic Hall in New York City on December 26, 1969. This \\"Bley-Peacock Synthesizer Show\\" performance, a group with singer/composer Annette Peacock, who had written much of his personal repertoire since 1964, was followed by her playing on the recordings Dual Unity (credited to \\"Annette & Paul Bley\\") and Improvisie. The latter was a French release of two extended improvisational tracks with Bley on synthesizers, Peacock's voice and keyboards, and percussion by Dutch free jazz drummer Han Bennink, who had also appeared on part of Dual Unity.  1970s  In 1972 Manfred Eicher released Bley's first solo piano recording, Open, to Love, on ECM Records. Bley also released the trio album, Paul Bley & Scorpio for Milestone Records in 1972 on which he plays two electric pianos and Arp synthesizer. In 1974, Bley and video artist Carol Goss, his second wife, founded the production company Improvising Artists. The label issued Jaco, the debut recording of Pat Metheny on electric guitar and Jaco Pastorius on electric bass, with Bley on electric piano and Bruce Ditmas on drums. Other IAI records and videos include Jimmy Giuffre, Lee Konitz, Dave Holland, Marion Brown, Gunter Hampel, Lester Bowie, Steve Lacy, Ran Blake, Perry Robinson, Nan√° Vasconcelos, John Gilmore, two solo piano records by Sun Ra, and others. Bley and Goss are credited in a Billboard cover story with the first commercial \\"music video\\".  1980s  Bley was featured in Ron Mann's 1981 documentary film Imagine the Sound, in which he performs and discusses the evolution of free jazz and his music. Bley began to record for multiple labels in the 1980s in many different formats including: solo piano albums: Tears for Owl Records, Tango Palace for Soulnote, PAUL BLEY SOLO for Justin Time Records, Blues for Red for Red Records; duo recording, Diane, with Chet Baker for Steeplechase; The Montreal Tapes with Charlie Haden and Paul Motian for Verve, Fragments with John Surman, Bill Frisell, and Paul Motian for ECM and three new recordings with Jimmy Giuffre and Steve Swallow for Owl Records, and numerous other recordings.  1990s  Bley continued to tour in Europe, Japan, South America and the US recording prolifically as a soloist and with a wide range of ensembles. In 1993 the Montreal International Jazz Festival produced a Paul Bley Homage concert series of four nights. In some years he recorded more than eight albums. Notably, Bley revisited the synthesizer in a record for Postcards, titled Synthesis. During this time, Bley also became a part-time faculty member of the New England Music Conservatory, where he taught musicians, Satoko Fujii and Yitzhak Yedid. He would travel to Boston for one day a month, ostensibly to have lobster, often meeting with students in coffee shops as he considered that they already know how to play, but needed guidance in life. The American television network, Bravo, and the French Network, Arte, co-produced a one-hour biography of Paul Bley in 1998. Bley's autobiography was published in 1999 ( _Stopping Time: Paul Bley and the Transformation of Jazz_ )  2000s  In 2001 the National Archives of Canada acquired Bley's archives. In 2003 a book based on Bley interviews by musicologist Norman Meehan (Time Will Tell) was published. It was an in depth discussion of the process of improvisation. In 2008, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada. In 2009 the book Paul Bley: The Logic of Chance, written in Italian by jazz pianist Arrigo Cappelletti and translated into English by jazz pianist Greg Burk, was published. In addition to touring solo in the US and Europe, Bley released several solo piano recordings in this decade, including Basics, Nothing to Declare and About Time for Justin Time Records and Solo in Mondsee and Play Blue - Oslo Concert for ECM Records.

This kind of respirator is reusable, with the filters being replaced periodically. A respirator is a device designed to protect the wearer from inhaling hazardous atmospheres, including fumes, vapours, gases and particulate matter such as dusts and airborne microorganisms. There are two main categories: the air-purifying respirator, in which respirable air is obtained by filtering a contaminated atmosphere, and the air-supplied respirator, in which an alternate supply of breathable air is delivered. Within each category, different techniques are employed to reduce or eliminate noxious airborne contaminants. Air-purifying respirators range from relatively inexpensive single-use, disposable face masks sometimes referred to as a dust mask to more robust reusable models with replaceable cartridges often called a gas mask. Physical form Types of respirators by physical form. Click to enlarge. All respirators have some type of facepiece held to the wearer's head with straps, a cloth harness, or some other method. Facepieces come in many different styles and sizes, to accommodate all types of face shapes. The differences in respirator design impact the respirator assigned protection factors, i.e. the resulting degree of protection from which kind of hazard. Respirators can have half-face forms that cover the bottom half of the face including the nose and mouth, and full-face forms that cover the entire face. Half-face respirators are only effective in environments where the contaminants are not toxic to the eyes or facial area. For example, someone who is spray painting could wear a half-face respirator, but someone who works with chlorine gas would have to wear a full-face respirator.  Use A wide range of industries use respirators including healthcare & pharmaceuticals, defense & public safety services (defense, firefighting & law enforcement), oil and gas industries, manufacturing (automotive, chemical, metal fabrication, food and beverage, wood working, paper and pulp), mining, construction, agriculture and forestry, cement production, power generation, shipbuilding and the textile industry. = Fit testing = Most types of respirators depend upon forming a good seal between the respirator body and the face of the wearer. Fit testing procedures have been developed to ensure that the respirator is appropriate for the wearer and the wearer's donning technique is capable of creating an adequate seal. Poor fit can have a negative impact on the respirator's overall filtering effectiveness by as much as 65%. A study on respirator effectiveness conducted in Beijing found that facial fit was the primary contributor to total inward leakage (TIL), based on a test of nine different models. A high-quality respirator should see TIL of only around 5%. Facial hair such as a beard can interfere with proper fit. Qualitative fit testing typically subjects the wearer to an atmosphere containing an aerosol that can be detected by the wearer, such as saccharin or isoamyl acetate, with the wearer reporting whether detectable levels of the aerosol has penetrated into the breathing area. Quantitative fit testing typically uses a specially prepared respirator with an inserted probe. The respirator is donned, and aerosol concentrations inside and outside of the mask are compared and used to determine a numerical fit factor. Typical room atmosphere contains sufficient particulates to perform the test, but aerosol generators can be used to improve the test accuracy.Workplace protection factor (PF) of filtering facepiece, measured in real time with two optical dust meters. In-facepiece dust concentration is changed dozens of times in a matter of minutes due to changes of the size of the gaps between the mask and face. A U.S. Department of Labor study showed that in almost 40 thousand American enterprises, the requirements for the correct use of respirators are not always met. Experts note that in practice it is difficult to achieve elimination of occupational morbidity with the help of respirators: > It is well known how ineffective ... trying to compensate the harmful > workplace conditions with ... the use of respirators by employees. > Unfortunately, the only certain way of reducing the exceedance fraction to > zero is to ensure that Co (note: Co - concentration of pollutants in the > breathing zone) never exceeds the PEL value.

If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain viruses and bacteria. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure from the wearer's saliva and respiratory secretions to others, especially during surgical procedures. A surgical mask, by design, does not filter or block very small particles from the outside air that may be transmitted by coughs, sneezes, or certain medical procedures to the wearer. Surgical masks also do not provide complete protection from germs and other contaminants because of the loose fit between the surface of the face mask and the face. Collection efficiency of surgical mask filters can range from less than 10% to nearly 90% for different manufacturers‚Äô masks when measured using the test parameters for NIOSH certification. However, a study found that even for surgical masks with \\"good\\" filters, 80‚Äì100% of subjects failed an OSHA- accepted qualitative fit test, and a quantitative test showed 12‚Äì25% leakage. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends surgical masks in procedures where there can be an aerosol generation from the wearer, if small aerosols can produce a disease to the patient. Surgical N95 N95 healthcare particulate respirator and surgical mask cleared by NIOSH and FDAalt= Some N95 respirators have also been cleared by the U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration as surgical and are labeled \\"Surgical N95\\", \\"medical respirators,\\" or \\"healthcare respirators,\\" providing respiratory protection to the wearer as well.https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1794572O/surgical-n95-vs- standard-n95-which-to-consider.pdf The CDC recommends the use of respirators with at least N95 certification to protect the wearer from inhalation of infectious particles including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), pandemic influenza, and Ebola. = Escape respirators = Escape Only respirators or hoods such as Air-Purifying Escape Respirators are for use by the general public for chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) terrorism incidents. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Safety Equipment Association (ISEA) established the American National Standard for Air-Purifying Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices to define both test criteria and approval methods for fire/smoke escape hoods. ANSI/ISEA Standard 110 provides design guidance to manufacturers of Respiratory Protective Smoke Escape Devices (RPED) in the form of performance requirements and testing procedures. The standard covers certification, ISO registration for the manufacturer, associated test methods, labeling, conditioning requirements, independent process and quality control audits, and follow-up inspection programs. ANSI/ISEA 110 was prepared by members of the ISEA RPED group, in consultation with testing laboratories and was reviewed by a consensus panel representing users, health and safety professionals and government representatives. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission uses ANSI/ISEA 110 as the benchmark in their testing of fire escape masks.  Air-purifying respirators  Air- purifying respirators are respirators that draw in the surrounding air and purify it before it is breathed (unlike air-supplying respirators, which are sealed systems, with no air intake, like those used underwater). Air-purifying respirators are used against particulates, gases, and vapors that are at atmospheric concentrations less than immediately dangerous to life and health. They may be negative-pressure respirators driven by the wearer's inhalation and exhalation, or positive-pressure units such as powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Air-purifying respirators may use one or both of two kinds of filtration: mechanical filters retain particulate matter, while chemical cartridges remove gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other vapors. Additionally, air-purifying respirators may come in many forms: filtering facepiece respirators consist solely of a disposable mechanical filter; elastomeric respirators are reusable but have replaceable filters attached to the mask; and powered air-purifying respirators have a battery- powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters. According to the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, air-purifying respirators are recommended for concentrations of hazardous particulates or gases that are greater than the relevant occupational exposure limit but less than the immediately dangerous to life or health level and the manufacturer's maximum use concentration, subject to the respirator having a sufficient assigned protection factor. For substances hazardous to the eyes, a respirator equipped with a full facepiece, helmet, or hood is recommended. Air-purifying respirators are not effective during firefighting, in oxygen-deficient atmosphere, or in an unknown atmosphere; in these situations a self-contained breathing apparatus is recommended instead. = Types of filtration = Mechanical filter A video describing N95 certification testingMechanical filter respirators retain particulate matter such as dust created during woodworking or metal processing, when contaminated air is passed through the filter material. Since the filters cannot be cleaned and reused and have a limited lifespan, cost and disposability are key factors. Single-use, disposable and replaceable cartridge models exist. Mechanical filters remove contaminants from air in several ways: interception when particles following a line of flow in the airstream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it; impaction, when larger particles unable to follow the curving contours of the airstream are forced to embed in one of the fibers directly; this increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity; by diffusion, where gas molecules collide with the smallest particles, especially those below 100 nm in diameter, which are thereby impeded and delayed in their path through the filter, increasing the probability that particles will be stopped by either of the previous two mechanisms; and by using certain resins, waxes, and plastics as coatings on the filter material to attract particles with an electrostatic charge that holds them on the filter surface. There are many different filtration standards that vary by jurisdiction. In the United States, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health defines the categories of particulate filters according to their NIOSH air filtration rating. The most common of these are the N95 mask, which filters at least 95% of airborne particles but is not resistant to oil. Other categories filter 99% or 99.97% of particles, or have varying degrees of resistance to oil. In the European Union, European standard EN 143 defines the 'P' classes of particle filters that can be attached to a face mask, while European standard EN 149 defines classes of \\"filtering half masks\\" or \\"filtering face pieces\\" (FFP masks). According to 3M, respirators made according to the following standards from other countries are equivalent to U.S. N95 or European FFP2 respirators include the Chinese KN95, Australian / New Zealand P2, Korean 1st Class also referred to as KF94, and Japanese DS. Chemical cartridge end-of- service-life indicator, ESLI).alt= Chemical cartridge respirators use a cartridge to remove gases, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other vapors from breathing air by adsorption, absorption, or chemisorption. A typical organic vapor respirator cartridge is a metal or plastic case containing from 25 to 40 grams of sorption media such as activated charcoal or certain resins. The service life of the cartridge varies based, among other variables, on the carbon weight and molecular weight of the vapor and the cartridge media, the concentration of vapor in the atmosphere, the relative humidity of the atmosphere, and the breathing rate of the respirator wearer. When filter cartridges become saturated or particulate accumulation within them begins to restrict air flow, they must be changed.The document describes the methods used previously and currently used to perform the timely replacement of cartridges in air purifying respirators. If the concentration of harmful gases is immediately dangerous to life or health, in workplaces covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Act the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration specifies the use of air-supplied respirators except when intended solely for escape during emergencies.OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.134 \\"Respiratory Protection\\" NIOSH also discourages their use under such conditions. = Form factors =  Filtering facepiece  left Filtering facepiece respirators are discarded when they become unsuitable for further use due to considerations of hygiene, excessive resistance, or physical damage. These are typically simple, light, single-piece, half-face masks and employ the first three mechanical filter mechanisms in the list above to remove particulates from the air stream. The most common of these is the white, disposable Standard N95 variety; another type is the blue, Surgical N95 mask. It is discarded after single use or some extended period depending on the contaminant.  Elastomeric  P100-standard elastomeric filter mask worn by NYPD officeralt= Elastomeric respirators are reusable because the facepiece is cleaned and reused, but the filter cartridges are discarded and replaced when they become unsuitable for further use. These are replaceable- cartridge, multiple-use models. Typically one or two cartridges attach securely to a mask which has built into it a corresponding number of valves for inhalation and one for exhalation. Powered air-purifying respirators Powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) have a battery- powered blower that moves the airflow through the filters. They take contaminated air, remove a certain quantity of pollutants and return the air to the user. There are different units for different environments. The units consist of a powered fan which forces incoming air through one or more filters to the user for breathing. The fan and filters may be carried by the user or they may be remotely mounted and the user breathes the air through tubing. The filter type must be matched to the contaminants that need to be removed. Some PAPR's are designed to remove fine particulate matter, while others are suitable for working with volatile organic compounds as those in spray paints. These must have their filter elements replaced more often than a particulate filter.  Atmosphere-supplying respirators  These respirators do not purify the ambient air, but supply breathing gas from another source. The three types are the self contained breathing apparatus, which a compressed air cylinder is worn by the wearer; the supplied air respirators, where a hose supplies air from a stationary source; and combination respirators that integrate both types. According to the NIOSH Respirator Selection Logic, atmosphere-supplying are recommended for concentrations of hazardous particulates or gases that are greater than the immediately dangerous to life or health level; where the required assigned protection factor exceeds those of air-purifying respirators; during firefighting (self-contained breathing apparatuses only); in oxygen-deficient atmosphere; and in an unknown atmosphere. =Self- contained breathing apparatus= A self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) typically has three main components: a high-pressure air cylinder (e.g., 2200 psi to 4500 psi), a pressure gauge and regulator, and an inhalation connection (mouthpiece, mouth mask or full face mask), connected together and mounted to a carrying frame or a harness with adjustable shoulder straps and belt so it can be worn on the back. There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit. Open-circuit industrial breathing sets are filled with filtered, compressed air. The compressed air passes through a regulator, is inhaled and exhaled out of the circuit, quickly depleting the supply of air. Air cylinders are made of aluminum, steel, or of a composite construction like fiberglass-wrapped aluminum. The \\"positive pressure\\" type is common, which supplies a steady stream of air to stop fumes or smoke from leaking into the mask. Other SCBA's are of the \\"demand\\" type, which only supply air when the regulator senses the user inhaling. All fire departments and those working in toxic environments use the positive pressure SCBA for safety reasons. The closed-circuit type SCBA filters, supplements, and recirculates exhaled gas like a rebreather. It is used when a longer- duration supply of breathing gas is needed, such as in mine rescue and in long tunnels, and going through passages too narrow for a large open-circuit air cylinder. = Supplied air respirator = Supplied air respirators make use of a hose to deliver air from a stationary source. It provides clean air for long periods of time and are light weight for the user, although it limits user mobility. They are normally used when there are extended work periods required in atmospheres that are not immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH).  Regulation  The choice and use of respirators in developed countries is regulated by national legislation. To ensure that employers choose respirators correctly, and perform high-quality respiratory protection programs, various guides and textbooks have been developed: { class=\\"wikitable sortable collapsible collapsed\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" ! colspan=\\"5\\"  Textbooks and guidelines for the selection and use of respirators - !

History =Earliest records to 19th century= The history of protective respiratory equipment can be traced back as far as the first century, when Pliny the Elder (circa A.D. 23-79) described using animal bladder skins to protect workers in Roman mines from red lead oxide dust. In the 16th century, Leonardo da Vinci suggested that a finely woven cloth dipped in water could protect sailors from a toxic weapon made of powder that he had designed. In 1785, Jean-Fran√ßois Pil√¢tre de Rozier invented a respirator. Alexander von Humboldt introduced a primitive respirator in 1799 when he worked as a mining engineer in Prussia. Practically all respirators in the early 18th century consisted of a bag placed completely over the head, fastened around the throat with windows through which the wearer could see. Some were rubber, some were made of rubberized fabric, and still others of impregnated fabric, but in most cases a tank of compressed air or a reservoir of air under slight pressure was carried by the wearer to supply the necessary breathing air. In some devices certain means were provided for the adsorption of carbon dioxide in exhaled air and the rebreathing of the same air many times; in other cases valves allowed exhalation of used air. Julius Jeffreys first used the word \\"respirator\\" as a mask in 1836. The mask worked by capturing moisture and warmth in exhaled air in a grid of fine metal wires. Inhaled air then was warmed and moistened as it passed through the same metal grid, providing relief to sufferers of lung diseases. The Respirator became popular, and was mentioned in the literature of the day, including in the writings of Elizabeth Gaskell, William Makepeace Thackeray and Charles Dickens. Woodcut of Stenhouse's mask \\"How a Man may Breathe Safely in a Poisonous Atmosphere\\", an apparatus providing oxygen while using caustic soda to absorb carbon dioxide, 1909 In 1848, the first US patent for an air- purifying respirator was granted to Lewis P. Haslett for his 'Haslett's Lung Protector,' which filtered dust from the air using one-way clapper valves and a filter made of moistened wool or a similar porous substance. Following Haslett, a long string of patents were issued for air purifying devices, including patents for the use of cotton fibers as a filtering medium, for charcoal and lime absorption of poisonous vapors, and for improvements on the eyepiece and eyepiece assembly. Hutson Hurd patented a cup-shaped mask in 1879 which became widespread in industrial use, and Hurd's H.S. Cover Company was still in business in the 1970s. Inventors in Europe included John Stenhouse, a Scottish chemist, who investigated the power of charcoal in its various forms, to capture and hold large volumes of gas. He built one of the first respirators able to remove toxic gases from the air, paving the way for activated charcoal to become the most widely used filter for respirators. Irish physicist John Tyndall took Stenhouse's mask, added a filter of cotton wool saturated with lime, glycerin, and charcoal, and in 1871 invented a 'fireman's respirator', a hood that filtered smoke and gas from air, which he exhibited at a meeting of the Royal Society in London in 1874. Also in 1874, Samuel Barton patented a device that 'permitted respiration in places where the atmosphere is charged with noxious gases, or vapors, smoke, or other impurities.' German Bernhard Loeb patented several inventions to 'purify foul or vitiated air,' and counted the Brooklyn Fire Department among his customers. A predecessor of the N95 was a design by Doctor Lien-teh Wu who was working for the Chinese Imperial Court in the fall of 1910, which was the first that protected users from bacteria in empirical testing. Subsequent respirators were reusable but bulky and uncomfortable. In the 1970s, the Bureau of Mines and NIOSH developed standards for single-use respirators, and the first N95 respirator was developed by 3M and approved in 1972. =World War I= The first recorded response and defense against chemical attacks using respirators occurred during the Second Battle of Ypres on the Western Front in World War I. It was the first time Germany used chemical weapons on a large scale releasing 168 tons of chlorine gas over a four-mile (6 km) front killing around 6,000 troops within ten minutes through asphyxiation. The gas being denser than air flowed downwards forcing troops to climb out of their trenches. Reserve Canadian troops, who were away from the attack, used urine- soaked cloths as primitive respirators. A Canadian soldier realized that the ammonia in urine would react with the chlorine, neutralizing it, and that the water would dissolve the chlorine, allowing soldiers to breathe through the gas. = 21st century = China normally makes 10 million masks per day, about half of the world production. During the COVID-19 pandemic, 2,500 factories were converted to produce 116 million daily. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people in the United States were urged to make their own cloth masks due to the widespread shortage of commercial masks.

He originated the term vexillology, which refers to the scholarly analysis of all aspects of flags. He was a founder of several vexillology organizations. Smith was a Laureate and a Fellow of the International Federation of Vexillological Associations. Early life Whitney Smith Jr. was born on February 26, 1940 to Mildred and Whitney Smith. As a youth, he lived in Lexington and Winchester, Massachusetts. With Patriots' Day memories and a 1946 gift of The Golden Encyclopedia, Smith's interest in flags was started. At Harvard, he studied political science and received a bachelor's degree in the field in 1961. During his time at Harvard, Smith designed Guyana's flag. He received his doctorate in political science at Boston University in 1964. Political symbolism was the subject of his dissertation. Career Smith designed the proposal for the flag of Guyana which, after modification and addition of black and white, was adopted in 1966. It is also known as The Golden Arrowhead. flag of Antarctica. Antarctica has no government or sovereign ruler and the flag has not been adopted in an official capacity by any organization. Smith had his first article published at age 18. By 1960, he was consulting with the Encyclopaedia Britannica. In 1961, Smith and colleague Gerhard Grahl co-founded The Flag Bulletin (), the world's first journal about flags. The following year, Smith established The Flag Research Center at his home and was its director. Smith worked with Klaes Sierksma to organize the First International Congress of Vexillology (Muiderberg, Netherlands) in 1965. They joined Louis M√ºhlemann in founding the International League of Vexillologists and were members of its Governing Board on September 5, 1965, and operated until September 3, 1967. The league was replaced by the International Federation of Vexillological Associations (known by its French acronym FIAV) with Smith as vice-president of the Provisional Council as of September 3, 1967. In 1969, Smith moved from being FIAV Provisional Council vice-president to being the first Secretary-General of FIAV. Smith was also responsible for founding the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA) and the Flag Heritage Foundation. On August 28, 1981, he was elected the second Secretary-General for Congresses, ending his multiple terms as FIAV Secretary-General. Smith served in that office until he returned to the FIAV Secretary-General position on September 29, 1983. Smith quit his full-time professorship at Boston University in 1970. By 1985, he had written 19 books. On July 5, 1991, Smith was named by the FIAV a Laureate of the Federation and left the office of FIAV Secretary-General.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1986 to 1995, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Progressive Conservative Premier Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1995. The son of Jean Louis Ducharme and Mackalena Andreychuk, he was educated in St. Vital and at the University of Manitoba, and worked as an insurance broker and real estate dealer before entering public life. He was a member of the Winnipeg Real Estate Board and the Manitoba Brokers Association. He began his political career as a school trustee for the St. Vital School Board and was an alderman in Winnipeg from 1980 to 1986. He married Yvonne Normandeau in 1963. Ducharme was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election, defeating incumbent New Democrat Doreen Dodick in the south-end Winnipeg seat of Riel. The NDP won the election, and Ducharme sat in the opposition benches for the next two years. The NDP were unexpectedly defeated in the legislature in 1988, and the Progressive Conservatives managed to form a minority government after the election which followed. Ducharme faced a difficult challenge from Liberal Chris Sigurdson, winning by only 324 votes (the Liberals made strong inroads into both Tory and NDP ridings in this cycle). On May 9, 1988, Ducharme was appointed Manitoba Minister of Urban Affairs and Manitoba Minister of Housing. Liberal support declined in the provincial election of 1990, and Ducharme was re-elected in Riel with an increased majority. Following a cabinet shuffle on February 5, 1991, he was named Manitoba Minister of Government Services, responsible for Seniors. Ducharme resigned from cabinet on March 20, 1995, and was not a candidate in the subsequent election. He has not run for provincial or federal office since this time. In 1998, Ducharme was made Chairman of the Manitoba Municipal Board. He stepped down from this position in 2000, shortly after the NDP under Gary Doer were returned to power.

It follows the coast of Oregon from the mouth of the Columbia River to the California border south of Brookings. The trail was envisioned in 1959 by Samuel N. Dicken, a University of Oregon geography professor, approved in 1971 by the Oregon Recreation Trails Advisory Council and developed and managed by the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department as part of the state park system of Oregon. The walking length of the trail varies depending on choice of passage across or around estuaries and rivers along the route. If a ferry is not arranged or available, an alternate route around the estuary must be taken; if traveling on foot, this means road walking. The length of the trail, using the Google Maps pedometer tool to measure route mileage, is about if no ferries are used, though the official coastal guide gives a length of . If no ferries are used, about 39 percent of the route is on the beach, 41 percent is on paved road, and 20 percent is on trail and dirt roads. A chief feature of the trail are the public beaches created in 1967 via the Oregon Beach Bill, which formalized the public nature of the coastal beaches since the first such law was passed in 1913. Many of the locations, particularly on the southern portion, are remote and isolated. The Oregon coast is bordered by a temperate rainforest, much of which is now second or third growth. The difficulty of the trail ranges from easy to moderate, with elevation changes of up to a few hundred feet.  Route  Oregon Coast Trail crossing over a headland in Samuel H. Boardman State Park The northern trailhead is at the base of the south jetty of the Columbia River, approximately 4 miles (6 km) north of the campground of Fort Stevens State Park and about 13 miles (21 km) from the city of Astoria. The trail runs north-south along the entire Oregon Coast, following the shore as closely as practical. For many portions of the route, it is beach walking, mostly on sand. In populated areas it often follows the nearest street to the shore. Many parts of the trail leave the beach and take an inland path, usually where land formations make the shoreline impassable, such as at Cape Kiwanda. Some of the rocky headlands are passable on foot at beach level only at low tide. Other headlands are traversed by state park or forest service trails well above the sea. In many other places, the road is the only feasible route, mostly U.S. Route 101. The southern terminus of the trail is the unmarked Oregon/California border on a stretch of beach about south of Brookings, and about half a mile south of the Winchuck River. Besides headlands, there are numerous rivers and creeks which must be crossed. Most creeks are forded by wading, although sometimes the water can be waist deep even at low tide. At high tide, some are hazardous or impossible to cross and require a boat or a detour to a bridge. Rainfall during winter and early spring decreases the number of streams which are safely fordable.  Trail- walking information  A dedicated guidebook for the OCT has not been published. In 2009, the State of Oregon posted a set of downloadable maps with brief route descriptions. Local Oregon hiking guidebooks have good descriptions of portions of the route, particularly for the trail segments. Updated route guides are published on a discussion group.The route guide is published in the Yahoo! Groups moderated subscription group OregonCoastTrail; look under files for OCT.xlss, a spreadsheet describing segments of the route. A recently published descriptive trail guide can be accessed in the Links at the bottom of the page. The Oregon Coast Trail is a described route and not a continuous trail. More than of the route is on pavement. The OCT is signed throughout its length, but in some places signage is not reliable. However it is difficult to become lost since the route is never more than a few miles from a paved road. The trail is open to hikers, and in some places, to bicycles, and equestrians. As portions of the route lead around headlands or cross river mouths that are only passable at low tide, carrying a current tide table and relevant topographic information can be extremely helpful. Sometimes a hiker must choose between waiting for a lower tide or walking inland to avoid high water. Seasonal recreation restrictions are in place from March 15 through September 15 in some locations to protect shorebird nesting. These restrictions include complete prohibition of dogs, camping, non-motorized vehicles (including bicycles and fat bikes), motorized vehicles, and kites. Hikers and equestrians must also stay on the wet sand, including potty breaks or rest stops. Shorebird areas are clearly marked on the beach with yellow signs. Online maps are available from Oregon Parks and Recreation Department here: Oregon Parks and Recreation : Western Snowy Plover : Parks, Campgrounds, Beaches : State of Oregon Many state campgrounds have areas dedicated for hikers and bicyclists at reduced prices (compared to vehicles). Beach camping is allowed where out of sight of residences, not adjacent to state parks, and not near snowy plover during nesting season. This limits camping on some areas of the trail to developed campgrounds, particularly along the northern beaches. The State of Oregon has stated its intention to create more primitive and free camping areas. Vehicles are allowed on a few beaches. Dune buggies are used extensively in the Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area, a stretch of beach from Florence to Coos Bay. Several portions of the trail are pristine and secluded, such as the segment from Bandon to Port Orford, where several days of relative solitude and free camping exist. Prevailing winds are from the northwest which makes the trail easier to hike from north to south. Route descriptions are also written assuming a north to south direction of travel. Cities and towns of various sizes are located along Highway 101 every permitting re-provisioning on a regular basis. Public transportation is extremely limited along the coast.

(i.e., word-to-fit-world) vs. world-to-word (i.e., world-to-fit-word) used by advocates of speech act theory such as John Searle. In general In philosophy of mind, a belief has a mind-to-world direction of fit.Searle (2001), p.37. A belief (that p, say) depicts the world as being in a state of affairs such that p is true. Beliefs, some philosophers have argued,Searle (2001), p.37. aim at the truth and so aim to fit the world. A belief is satisfied when it fits the world. A desire, on the other hand, normally expresses a yet to be realized state of affairs and so has a world-to-mind direction of fit.Searle (2001), p.37-8. A desire that p, unlike a belief, doesn't depict the world as being in the state that p; rather it expresses a desire that the world be such that p is true. Desire is a state that is satisfied when the world fits it. A way to account for the difference is that a (rational) person that holds the belief that p when confronted with evidence that not-p, will revise his belief, whereas a person that desires that p can retain his desire that p in the face of evidence that not-p. To a philosopher of language a word-to-world fit occurs when, say, a sports journalist correctly names Jones as a goal scorer; while if the journalist mistakenly names Smith as the goal scorer, the printed account does not display a word- to-world fit, and must be altered such that it matches the real world. Conversely, a world-to-word fit occurs when a fan of Smith's team opines that they deserved to win the match, even though they lost. In this case, the world would have to change to make the sports fan's wish become true. However, in the case of, say, a judge delivering a death sentence to a criminal declared guilty by a jury, the utterances of the judge alter the world, through the fact of that utterance; and, in this case, the judge is generating a world-to- word-to-world fit (see below). So, if the judge's opinion is upheld, the world must be altered to match the content of the judge's utterance (i.e., the criminal must be executed). In medieval philosophy According to Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologica, Part I, Question 21, Article 2), there are two kinds of \\"truth\\" (veritas), both understood as correspondence between mind (intellectus) or words (oratio) and world (\\"things\\", res): In speech act theory Perhaps the first to speak of a \\"direction of fit\\" was the philosopher J. L. Austin. Austin did not use the distinction between different directions of fit to contrast commands or expressions of intention to assertions, or desires to beliefs. He rather distinguishes different ways of asserting that an item is of a certain type. In an extensive discussionAustin (1953), p.234. of the issues involved with the differences between, say, (a) wrongly calling a triangle a square (something which, he said, was committing an act of violence to the language) and (b) wrongly describing a triangular object as being a square (something which, he said, was committing an act of violence to the facts), Austin distinguished between what he termed: * \\"the onus of match\\": in the case of one wanting to match X and Y, the distinction between the matching of X to Y and the matching of Y to X; and * \\"the direction of fit\\": in the case of naming something, the difference between the fitting of a name to an item, and the fitting of an item to a name. The concept of direction of fit can also apply to speech acts: e.g., statements, guesses and conjectures have word-to-world direction of fit, while commands and promises have a world-to-word direction of fit. John Searle and Daniel VandervekenSearle & Vanderveken, (1985), pp.52-53. assert that there are only four possible \\"directions of fit\\" in language: :1. The word-to-world direction of fit. :In achieving success of fit the propositional content of the utterance fits an independently existing state of affairs in the world. E.g.: \\"We are married\\". :2. The world-to-word direction of fit. :To achieve success of fit the world must change to match the propositional content of the utterance. E.g.: \\"Will you marry me?\\", \\"I want to marry him\\", \\"You'd just better marry her, buddy!\\", etc. :3. The double direction of fit. :To achieve success of fit the world is thereby altered to fit the propositional content by representing the world as being so altered, unlike sense 2. E.g.: \\"I declare you man and wife\\". The 'doubled' direction is therefore always world- to-word-to-world. For obvious reasons, Searle calls sentences of this type 'declarations'. :4. The null or empty direction of fit. :There is no direct question of achieving success of fit between the propositional content and the world, because success of fit is presupposed by the utterance. E.g.: \\"I'm glad I married you\\" presupposes that the speaker is married to the listener. Searle used this notion of \\"direction of fit\\" to create a taxonomy of illocutionary acts.See Searle (1975/1976/1979). Although Elizabeth Anscombe never employed the term \\"the direction of fit\\", Searle has strongly arguedSearle, 1985, p.3. that the following passage from her work Intention was, by far, \\"the best illustration\\" of the distinction between the tasks of \\"[getting] the words (more strictly their propositional content) to match the world‚Ä¶ [and that of getting] the world to match the words\\": In philosophy of mind According to Velleman, when used in the domain of the philosophy of mind, the concept direction of fit represents the distinguishing feature between two types of intentional mental states: :Facta (singular factum, states that currently exist) are states with a mind-to-world direction of fit. : Examples include beliefs, perceptions, hypotheses, and fantasies. In the event of a mismatch between the mental state and the world, the mental state is in some sense false or wrong and should perhaps be changed. :Facienda (singular faciendum, states that are yet to exist) are states with a world-to-mind direction of fit. :Examples include intentions and desires. If there is a mismatch between the mental state and the world, the world is in some sense wrong and should perhaps be changed. In some forms of mind-body dualism, a matching factum and faciendum must be present in a person's mind in order for him to act intentionally. If a person has the belief that action (A) will lead to state (S), and has the desire that state (S) obtain, then he will perform action (A). The action is directly caused by simultaneous presence of the two mental states; no further explanation is needed. According to Velleman: ::The term \\"direction of fit\\" refers to the two ways in which attitudes can relate propositions to the world. ::In cognitive attitudes [such as belief], a proposition is grasped as patterned after the world; whereas in conative attitudes [such as desire], the proposition is grasped as a pattern for the world to follow. ::The propositional object of desire is regarded not as fact -- not, that is, as factum, having been brought about -- but rather as faciendum, to be brought about: it's regarded not as true but as to be made true.Velleman, (1992), p.8.

It claims to be the oldest school in the United States. It is located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and is a member of both the New York Interschool and the Ivy Preparatory School League. It is ranked one of the best private schools in the United States. History Collegiate was chartered as part of the Reformed Dutch Protestant Church in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in 1638 by the Dutch West India Company and the Classis of Amsterdam. Its initial incarnation was a co-ed school located south of Canal Street. The institution's location has changed 16 times over the last four centuries. =Founding Date Controversy= In 1984, Massimo Maglione, a historian and Upper School teacher at Collegiate, discovered a letter that Collegiate's founder‚Äîthe Reverend Jonas Micha√´lius, the first minister of the Dutch Reformed Church in America‚Äîhad written in 1628 about his efforts to teach the catechism to Indian children. Based on this letter, the school controversially moved up the year of its establishment to 1628. While Reverend Jonas Micha√´lius did arrive in New Amsterdam in 1628 and may have worked as an educator at that time, Collegiate School was not chartered until 1638, placing its founding two years after the founding of Harvard University and three years after the founding of The Boston Latin School. =Location= On February 5, 2013, the Collegiate School board announced relocation plans for the institution. The school acquired land for a new facility, situated between West End Avenue and Riverside Boulevard and between West 61st and 62nd Streets in New York's Riverside South neighborhood. Board Chairman George R. Bason, Jr. '72 said the new 178,000-square-foot school would provide 30% more indoor space and over 600% more outdoor space (16,268 square feet) for its 648 students from kindergarten through 12th grade than the existing lodgings provided. He estimated the new school's construction cost at $125‚Äì$135 million. On January 12, 2018, Collegiate officially opened its new location at 301 Freedom Place South. School seal and mottos Collegiate's official seal is an adaptation of the coat of arms of William of Orange, who was the founder of the Dutch Republic and of the Reformed Church in that country and led the cause of independence and of freedom for the Reformed Church against Philip II of Spain. Included in the school's seal are two mottos: ', Dutch for \\"In unity there is strength\\", and ', Latin for \\"unless God, then in vain.\\" Organization Current campus at 301 Freedom Place Old Collegiate School campus =Campus= From 1892‚Äì2017, Collegiate resided at several buildings on 77th and 78th Streets on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The former schoolhouse on West 77th Street is, together with the adjoining West End Collegiate Church, an historic landmark in the City of New York. In 2013, the school announced that it would be moving to a new location and in January 2018, Collegiate moved into a new facility at 301 Freedom Place South. It consists of an 11-story building (nine stories above ground and two below ground), with of classroom, athletics, theater, music, art, library, dining, and administrative space. The school features common areas dedicated to each division that provide space for independent study, social interactions, and divisional activities. The Lower School is located on floors 2 and 3. The Middle School occupies floors 8 and 9. It has its own Maker Space, along with flexible classrooms, a Middle School Center and large, modern group study spaces. The Upper School is housed on floors 5 and 6. It is significantly larger than the division's previous space and is adjacent to the library. It features flexible classrooms and common areas that promote interaction among students and faculty. Sciences for all three divisions are consolidated onto floor 7. Visual arts and music occupy floor 4, complete with music practice spaces, art studios, and a digital photo lab. Additionally, on the Lower Level, performing arts benefit from a 307-seat auditorium and a black-box theater, both of which support Collegiate's drama program. Collegiate's athletics are housed in the Lower Level and include a high school regulation- size gym that supports the basketball teams. The gym can be partitioned to provide PE classes and practice space simultaneously. An additional gym, the Alumni Gym, can accommodate regulation wrestling competitions and half-court basketball and features a retractable batting cage. Outdoor space consists of a large roof deck on floor 9 with a large recreation area and a ground-level, 5,000-square-foot courtyard that allows for handball and basketball. =Structure= Each grade has around 50 boys, who attend Collegiate for the full course of study, thirteen years (these students are nicknamed \\"Survivors\\"). The school is divided into Lower School (Kindergarten-Grade 4), Middle School (Grades 5-8), and Upper School (Grades 9-12). More than a quarter of Collegiate teachers hold a Ph.D. The school is private, and it functions under a New York City non-profit statute enacted in the 1940s. Collegiate is controlled by a Board of Trustees, and the school is administered by a Head of School. =Leadership= Collegiate School was headed by Lee M. Levison from July 1, 2006 until June 30, 2020. He was preceded by W. Lee Pierson, the interim Head of School following the departure of Kerry P. Brennan in 2004.Collegiate School, About Us: History, Retrieved October 9, 2019. Levison announced his intention to retire in December 2018, causing The Board of Trustees to immediately commence a search for his replacement.Collegiate School, Head of School Search, Retrieved October 9, 2019. On May 31, 2019, the Board of Trustees unanimously voted to appoint David S. Lourie, Head of the St. Anne's-Belfield School since 2009, as Collegiate's 29th Head of School.St. Anne's-Belfield School, Senior Administration, Retrieved October 9, 2019. He began his tenure upon Levison's retirement on July 1, 2020. Rankings In 2007, The Wall Street Journal ranked Collegiate number one in the world in terms of percent of the senior class matriculating to eight selective American colleges. A 2019-20 survey concluded that Collegiate was the 3rd best boys school in the country, the 4th best K-12 school in the country, and the 13th best private high school in the country. Sports and co-curricular activities The school's athletic success has mainly been with the varsity basketball, baseball, track and field, soccer, and cross country teams. The Collegiate soccer team won the NYSAIS state championship in 2010, 2011, and 2012. The Collegiate varsity basketball team won five straight state championships in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. The Collegiate cross country team won 25 Ivy League Championships in a row from 1990‚Äì2014. Collegiate also has wrestling and tennis teams. Students not participating in a sport take physical education. Yearly fitness tests are administered in the lower and middle schools. The school has a number of clubs, especially in the Upper School, including The Collegiate Journal. its newspaper operating since 1932; The Dutchman, the yearbook published every year since 1906; and Prufrock. its literary magazine, first published in 1973. Mascot The school's mascot, a depiction of Peter Stuyvesant, often called \\"Peg Legged Pete\\" by students, has been a subject of recent controversy because of his pronounced lack of religious tolerance and his anti- Semitism.Otto, Paul, \\"Peter Stuyvesant.\\" in American National Biography, volume 21, 99‚Äì100. New York: Oxford University Press. 1999.

Gas cracker Petrochemicals are usually manufactured in large scale from petroleum feed stocks using fluid catalytic cracking. Naphtha, natural gas, refinery off-gas and gas from cokers and thermal crackers are good sources. Thus natural gas is one of the most wanted feed stocks for petrochemicals production. The thermal craking of natural gas proceeds at very high temperature resulting in olefins (Mostly ethylene/propylene). The temperature in a gas cracker exceeds 1000¬∞C. For ultimate decomposition of gas into elements more than 1500 ¬∞C is required. Thus, acetylene/carbon black production encounters such high temperatures. Usually oxy-combustion methods are used for attaining such high temperatures. BASF burners/Kellog burners are available in the market.

It is the third most common member of its family after the standard C flute and the piccolo. It is characterized by its rich, mellow tone in the lower portion of its range. It is a transposing instrument in G (a perfect fourth below written C), and uses the same fingerings as the C flute. The bore of the alto flute is considerably larger in diameter and longer than a C flute and requires more breath from the player.Finding Your Flute (How to Choose, Rent, Buy a New or Used Flute) This gives it a greater dynamic presence in the bottom octave and a half of its range. It was the favourite flute variety of Theobald Boehm, who perfected its design, and is pitched in the key of G (sounding a perfect fourth lower than written). Its range is from G3 (the G below middle C) to G6 (4 ledger lines above the treble clef staff) plus an altissimo register stretching to D7. The headjoint may be straight or curved. British music that uses this instrument often refers to it as a bass flute, which can be confusing since there is a distinct instrument known by that name. This naming confusion originated in the fact that the modern flute in C is pitched in the same range as the Renaissance tenor flute; therefore, a lower pitched instrument would be called a bass. http://www.oldflutes.com/renai.htm Headjoint shape Alto flute with curved head. Alto flute with straight head. Alto flute headjoints are built in 'curved' and 'straight' versions. The curved headjoint is frequently preferred by smaller players because it requires less of a stretch for the arms, and makes the instrument feel lighter by moving the center of gravity nearer to the player. However, the straight version is more commonly used for better overall intonation.Phyllis Louke - Article: Getting Started Playing Alto, Bass and Contrabass Flutes The embouchure for alto flute is similar to that for C flute, but in proportion to the size of the instrument. Hence the embouchure- hole sits lower on the lower lip, and the lip-aperture is wider. Repertoire The following lists are not intended to be complete, but rather to present a representative sampling of the most commonly played and well- known works in the genre. The lists also do not generally include works originally written for other instruments and subsequently transcribed, adapted, or arranged for alto flute, unless such piece is very common in the repertory, in which case it is listed with its original instrumentation noted. =Alto flute alone= * Bruno Bartolozzi: Cantilena * Garth Baxter: Variations on the Willow Tree * Jonathan Bayley: Music for Pan (1982) * Michael Csany-Wills: Trystyng * Charles Delaney: Variations on the 'Seeds of Love' (1989) * Jon Gibson: Untitled (1974) * Alexander Goehr: Ariel Sing (2003) * Philippe Hersant: Cinq Miniatures (1995) * Daniel Kessner: A Serene Music (2012) * Coreen Morsink: Andromache (2010) * Patrick Nunn: Maqamat (2002) * Michael Oliva: Les Heures Bleues (2013) * Edwin Roxburgh: The Curlew (1994) * Kaija Saariaho: Couleurs du vent (1998) * Harvey Sollberger: Hara * Karlheinz Stockhausen: **Susani's Echo, 3. ex Nr.

It is featured in Ravel's Daphnis et Chlo√©, Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, Franco Alfano's opera Cyrano de Bergerac, Sergei Prokofiev's Scythian Suite and the original version of Webern's Six Pieces for Orchestra. Shostakovich used it in his operas The Gamblers (left unfinished), Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District (also known as Katerina Ismailova), as well as in his Symphony No. 7 (Leningrad). It also figures prominently in several movements of Gustav Holst's The Planets. It also appears in Howard Shore's music for The Lord of the Rings among many other contemporary film scores. One of the best-known uses of the alto flute in 20th century music was by Pierre Boulez in his piece Le marteau sans ma√Ætre for contralto and six instrumentalists. Even before 1940 it had been used occasionally in Hollywood; early Broadway pit orchestrations using the instrument include Jerome Kern's Music in the Air (1932) and Very Warm for May (1939), both scored by Robert Russell Bennett (the manuscript orchestrations are in the Jerome Kern Collection, Music Division, The Library of Congress). Performers A number of specialist alto flute players have emerged in recent years. These include French improvisor/composer Christian Le Delezir, American Christine Potter, British Kingma System alto flute player Carla Rees, jazz players Ali Ryerson and Brian Landrus, American Peter Sheridan who currently resides in Australia, Swiss composers/performers Matthias Ziegler and Stefan Keller and Dutch composer/performer Anne La Berge.

It is in the key of C, pitched one octave below the concert flute. Despite its name, its playing range makes it the tenor member of the flute family. Because of the length of its tube (approximately ), it is usually made with a J-shaped head joint, which brings the embouchure hole within reach of the player. It is usually only used in flute choirs, as it is easily drowned out by other instruments of comparable register, such as the clarinet. Kotato and Fukushima produce an instrument that they call bass flute in F, which some people refer to as a Contra-alto flute. Alternative terminology Prior to the mid-20th century, the term \\"bass flute\\" was sometimes used, especially in Great Britain, to refer to the alto flute instead (for example: the part for \\"bass flute in G\\" in Gustav Holst's The Planets). In 1910 Abelardo Albisi invented a bass flute known as the albisiphone which was used in scores by Mascagni and Zandonai among other composers during the first half of the 20th century. Range and construction The instrument's sounding range is from C3, one octave below middle C, to C6, two octaves above middle C. Bass flute music sounds an octave lower than it is written, which is the typical concert flute range (C4 to C7). Notes written above A6 are not often used as they are difficult to produce and have inferior tone. Because manufacturers do not taper the flute body through the curve, intonation of all notes beginning with written D6 and higher tend to be sharp. The player can bend them in tune through blowing technique or use alternative fingerings. Bass flutes often have a C foot rather than the B foot common to other flutes. The shorter tube reduces acoustic resistance, which quickens the response and makes the tone brighter, livelier, and more resonant. The shorter tube also makes the instrument somewhat lighter and less fatiguing for the player to hold. Bass flutes are most often made with silver-plated bodies and head joints. Most basses come with trill keys which allow the player to stabilize some otherwise unstable middle register notes as well as trill between otherwise impossible notes. Kotato basses have addressed the weight problem of bass flutes by designing a graphite rod that screws onto the underside of the instrument and then rests on the chair seat between the player's legs. Adjustable rods have also been developed by Jeff Amos. Other manufacturers have added a left hand thumb support called a crutch, which helps some players with physical control of the instrument. Dutch flute maker Eva Kingma has created a vertical design for the bass flute which allows the weight of the instrument to be supported by the floor. Repertoire An upright bass flute being played by Carla Rees Many composers are beginning to write more pieces for the bass flute. These include Katherine Hoover's Two for Two, Bill Douglas's Karuna, Sophie Lacaze's Archelogos II, Mike Mower's Obstinato and Scareso, Gary Schocker's A Small Sonata for a Large Flute, Lorenzo Ferrero's Ellipse and Shadow Lines, Sonny Burnett's Stone Suite, Catherine McMichael's Baikal Journey and Ennio Morricone's Secrets of the Sahara. Other important works include Tristan Murail's Ethers for solo bass flute and small ensemble, Brian Ferneyhough's Mnemosyne for bass flute and tape, Mario Lavista's Lamento a la muerte de Ra√∫l Lavista for solo bass flute, Michael Oliva's Moss Garden also for bass flute and tape, John Palmer's Inwards for bass flute and live-electronics, She Cried by Shiva Feshareki, and Marc Tweedie's Zoli, written for renowned flautist Carla Rees. Studies and concert etudes are beginning to appear that address the instrument's many challenges (physical balance, finger technique, air stream, overblowing, etc.). Peter Sheridan has commissioned and arranged new compositions in this area, including a set of 'Etudes for Low Flutes' by Hilary Taggart. The sixth movement of Claude Bolling's suite for Flute and Jazz Trio, 'Versatile' has the soloist playing the opening melody on a bass flute. Morton Feldman's composition \\"Crippled Symmetry\\" has a part for the bass flute, as does John Cage's late work \\"Seven2\\". Hans Pfitzner's 1917 opera Palestrina features an early (true) C bass flute part. Another piece featuring the bass flute is John Mackey's \\"The Frozen Cathedral\\" (2013) in two separate sections of the piece. For an extensive list of repertoire for bass flute and contrabass flute see Repertoire Catalogue for Piccolo, Alto Flute and Bass Flute (2004) by Peter van Munster (Roma: Riverberi Sonori). Selected repertoire graded into ability levels with short descriptions and information about basses can be found in The Alto and Bass Flute Resource Guide published by Falls House Press, and specialist low flutes publishing company Tetractys has a growing catalogue of works for bass flute. Other use A handful of jazz musicians have used the bass flute, including flutist Jeremy Steig, beginning with his 1975 album Temple of Birth, saxophonists Henry Threadgill, Brian Landrus, and James Carter, and drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson who occasionally played bass flute as a second instrument. Hubert Laws features the bass flute on his recording of \\"Amazing Grace,\\" in which he plays the first verse on bass flute, the second on alto, and the third on soprano. Steig later took up the Kotato & Fukushima bass flute in F. In electronic music, Jack Dangers has sometimes used bass flute as the leader of the Meat Beat Manifesto. A bass flute is heard throughout George Bruns' score for The Jungle Book and the original Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. Perhaps the best- known work to feature the bass flute is the album Wave by Ant√¥nio Carlos Jobim.

Terry J. Pudas became the Acting Director until October 1, 2006, when he became the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Forces Transformation and Resources. Defense Transformation OFT transformation plan includes changing the force and its culture from the bottom up through large amounts of experimentation, increased sharing of new knowledge and experiences, and by broadening military capabilities while mitigating risk. One of the pillar theories driving OFT is Network Centric Warfare (NCW), also known as Network Centric Operations, which according to OFT is a theory of war in the information age and the organizing principle for national military planning and joint concepts, capabilities, and systems. According to Cebrowski, \\"[Defense] Transformation is foremost a continuing process. It does not have an end point. Transformation is meant to create or anticipate the future. Transformation is meant to deal with the co-evolution of concepts, processes, organizations and technology. Change in any one of these areas necessitates change in all. Transformation is meant to create new competitive areas and new competencies. Transformation is meant to identify, leverage and even create new underlying principles for the way things are done. Transformation is meant to identify and leverage new sources of power. The overall objective of these changes is simply‚Äîsustained American competitive advantage in warfare.\\" The Defense Department's April 2003 \\"Transformation Planning Guidance\\" document defines transformation as \\"a process that shapes the changing nature of military competition and cooperation through new combinations of concepts, capabilities, people, and organizations that exploit out nation's advantages and protect against our asymmetric vulnerabilities to sustain our strategic position, which helps underpin peace and stability in the world.\\" OFT engaged in several project aimed at transforming the Defense Department through experimentation within exercises. Some of its major projects included Operationally Responsive Space and Stiletto, and it produced strategies that helped to form DeVenCI. OFT was also engaged in funding projects and developing concepts for reconstruction and stabilization as early as 2003.http://www.ndu.edu/CTNSP/S&R.htm; What sets OFT apart According to OFT, they: * Are the only office solely dedicated to transformation; * Strive to link creativity to implementation; * Work at the intersection of unarticulated needs and non-consensual change; * Identify and manage disruptive innovation; * Work outside the normal course of business activities; * Entrepreneurial mindset; * Use concept-technology pairing to explore; and * Experiment with new ways of operating.

It is associated with potentiation. High-frequency stimulation causes an increase in release called post-tetanic potentiation (Kandel 2003). This presynaptic event is caused by calcium influx. Calcium-protein interactions then produce a change in vesicle exocytosis. The result of these changes is to make the postsynaptic cell more likely to fire an action potential. Tetanic stimulation is used in medicine to detect a non-depolarizing block or a depolarizing block on the neuromuscular junction. Lower elicitations of tetanic stimulation in aged muscles were shown to be caused by lower levels of anaerobic energy provision in skeletal muscles.

He was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1988 to 1993, and a cabinet minister in the government of Gary Filmon from 1988 to 1992. Neufeld began a public practice as a Chartered Accountant in 1954, and was a member of the Chartered Accountants of Manitoba. He first ran for the Manitoba legislature in the 1986 provincial election as a Progressive Conservative, losing to incumbent New Democrat Vic Schroeder by 527 votes in the north-end Winnipeg riding of Rossmere. In the 1988 election, with NDP support falling throughout the province, he was able to defeat Schroeder by 526 votes in a rematch. Neufeld was appointed Minister of Energy and Mines with responsibility for the Manitoba Hydro Act and Seniors on May 9, 1988. He was relieved of the latter responsibility on April 21, 1989. He was re-elected by an increased margin in the 1990 provincial election. Neufeld stepped down from his cabinet position on January 14, 1992, and resigned from the legislature on May 12, 1993. There are suggestions that Neufeld resigned as a matter of principle, disturbed by the dubious methods used by the Filmon government to conceal its deficit spending.Schellenberg, Harry.

In the generic use, it refers to the hypothesis of an implication (wiktionary:implicant). In the particular use, a product term (i.e., a conjunction of literals) P is an implicant of a Boolean function F, denoted P \\\\le F, if P implies F (i.e., whenever P takes the value 1 so does F). For instance, implicants of the function :f(x,y,z,w)=xy+yz+w include the terms xy, xyz, xyzw, w, as well as some others.  Prime implicant  A prime implicant of a function is an implicant (in the above particular sense) that cannot be covered by a more general, (more reduced - meaning with fewer literals) implicant. W. V. Quine defined a prime implicant to be an implicant that is minimal - that is, the removal of any literal from P results in a non- implicant for F. Essential prime implicants (aka core prime implicants) are prime implicants that cover an output of the function that no combination of other prime implicants is able to cover. Using the example above, one can easily see that while xy (and others) is a prime implicant, xyz and xyzw are not. From the latter, multiple literals can be removed to make it prime: *x, y and z can be removed, yielding w. *Alternatively, z and w can be removed, yielding xy. *Finally, x and w can be removed, yielding yz. The process of removing literals from a Boolean term is called expanding the term. Expanding by one literal doubles the number of input combinations for which the term is true (in binary Boolean algebra). Using the example function above, we may expand xyz to xy or to yz without changing the cover of f.De Micheli, Giovanni. Synthesis and Optimization of Digital Circuits. McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1994 The sum of all prime implicants of a Boolean function is called its complete sum, minimal covering sum, or Blake canonical form.

It has two heads, one flat and the other, called the peen, rounded. It is distinguished from a cross-peen hammer, diagonal-peen hammer, point-peen hammer, or chisel-peen hammer by having a hemispherical peen. Uses Besides for peening (surface hardening by impact), the ball-peen hammer is useful for many tasks, such as striking punches and chisels (usually performed with the flat face of the hammer). The peening face is useful for rounding off edges of metal pins and fasteners, such as rivets. The ball face of the hammer can also be used to make gaskets for mating surfaces. A suitable gasket material is held over the surface where a corresponding gasket is desired, and the operator will lightly tap around the edges of the mating surface to perforate the gasket material. Variants A. Ball-peen hammer B. Straight-peen hammer C. Cross-peen hammer Variants include the straight-peen, diagonal-peen, and cross-peen hammer. These hammers have a wedge-shaped head instead of a ball-shaped head. This wedge shape spreads the metal perpendicular to the edge of the head. The straight-peen hammer has the wedge oriented parallel to the hammer's handle, while the cross-peen hammer's wedge is oriented perpendicular. The diagonal-peen hammer's head, as the name implies, is at a 45¬∞ angle from the handle. They are commonly used by blacksmiths during the forging process to deliver blows for forging or to strike other forging tools. Head materials Ball-peen hammer heads are typically made of heat treated forged high-carbon steel or alloy steel; it is harder than the face of a claw hammer. Softer brass heads are sometimes used.

J5N was developed as twin-engine interceptor for countering attacks by Boeing B-29 Superfortress.Shigeru 2000, p. 57. Design and development During the spring of 1943, the JNAF issued an 18-Shi specification for a single-seat twin-engine interceptor capable of reaching a top speed of 666 km/h (414 mph) at 6,000 m (19,690 ft). Nakajima submitted a proposal based on the earlier J1N1 Gekko three-seat night fighter, although this new aircraft ‚Äì designated J5N1 ‚Äì was slightly smaller. The layout of the J5N was similar to the J1N: a low set wing on which were mounted the two powerplants, 1,484 kW (1,990 hp) Nakajima Homare 21 18-cylinder air-cooled radial engines, with a long fuselage ending in a conventional tail arrangement. For maximum utilization of the power from the twin engines, large four-blade propellers were fitted which also featured large spinners (as fitted to the J1N). The main wheels retracted rearwards into the engine nacelles, and the tailwheel was fixed. The cockpit was set above the wing, and featured a starboard-opening canopy. The nose was streamlined to offer the pilot an excellent forward view during landing, takeoff and taxiing. Armament of the J5N consisted of two 30 mm and two 20 mm cannon, and provision was made for a centreline 250 kg (550 lb) bomb. The J5N was designed to combat the large, heavily armed and fast B-29 Superfortress, and so required such heavy armament in order to do severe damage in the brief windows of time allowed for firing passes. To concentrate the firepower, the four cannons were mounted in the nose of the J5N; if a single-engine fighter were unfortunate enough to find itself in front of a J5N, a single hit from a 30mm shell would have more than adequate to destroy it. Operational history Impressed with the design, the JNAF authorized the development of the J5N1, assigned the name Tenrai (Â§©Èõ∑\\"Heavenly Thunder\\"), and six prototypes were requested to be built. Progress was impeded by the failure of the engines to produce their promised power, and by a steady increase in the weight of the airframe as the need to reverse the long-standing policy of giving low priority to armor protection led to a buildup of weight and a drop in performance.Berliner 2011, p. 149. The first prototype ‚Äì lacking its armament ‚Äì made its first flight July 13, 1944, and was something of a disappointment. The top speed attained was only 597 km/h (371 mph) ‚Äì far below the specified 666 km/h (414 mph) of the requirement. Despite the other five prototypes also having flown with numerous enhancements, the aircraft never achieved its design speed, and the project was abandoned soon after in February 1945. Four of the six experimental aircraft were lost to accidents.Shigeru 2000, p. 56. Variants * J5N1 : Single-seat interceptor fighter aircraft. Six built.

Costello worked as a lawyer and served as mayor of St Kilda. He has authored a number of books on faith and life. A National Trust poll in 2014 elected him one of Australia's 100 national living treasures. Early life Costello was born in Melbourne, Victoria, where he grew up in the suburb of Blackburn and was educated at Carey Baptist Grammar School. He is a descendant of Irish immigrant Patrick Costello, who was expelled from the Parliament of Victoria in the 1860s for electoral fraud. Costello studied at Monash University, graduating with a Bachelor of Jurisprudence degreeResignation of Professor D. P. Derham, Dean of the Faculty of Law in 1976, a Bachelor of Laws in 1978 and a Diploma of Education in 1979. Costello is the brother of Peter Costello, the former treasurer of Australia and Federal Member for Higgins. Career =Legal= Costello practised as a solicitor in family and criminal law, both in established firms and in his own practice. =Ministry= In 1981, Costello travelled to Switzerland with his wife, Merridie, where they both studied theology at the International Baptist Seminary Rueschlikon near Zurich, before graduating with a Bachelor of Divinity and returning to Australia to become the minister of St Kilda Baptist Church. He also received a Master of Theology from Whitley College, a theological college of the Melbourne College of Divinity. Ordained as a Baptist minister in 1987, Costello, along with his wife Merridie and a team of others, rebuilt the congregation at the St Kilda Baptist Church and opened a drop-in centre. As part of the church's outreach program, he started a legal office at the church where he practised as a part-time solicitor. He also taught urban ministry at Whitley College, a college of the University of Melbourne. From 1995 to 2003, Costello was a minister of the Collins Street Baptist Church and the executive director of Urban Seed, a Christian not-for- profit organisation created in response to concern about homelessness, drug abuse and the marginalisation of the city's street people. Costello served as the president of the Baptist Union of Australia from 1999 to 2002. He has also been patron of Baptist World Aid Australia, a member of the Australian Earth Charter Committee, a council member of the Australian Centre for Christianity and Culture, a spokesperson for the Interchurch Gambling Taskforce, a member of the National Advisory Body on Gambling and a member of the Alcohol Education and Rehabilitation Foundation. =Political career= Costello was elected Mayor of St Kilda Council in 1993 and became well known for championing the cause of local democracy and for his clashes with the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. Kennett attacked Costello as being un-Victorian for speaking out against the gaming-led recovery of the state and often referred to him as \\"that leftist cleric\\". Costello's political career ended when his mayoral position was abolished with the whole St Kilda Council in Kennett's reform and consolidation of local government in 1994. Towards the end of that time, he was approached by the Australian Democrats political party to fill a casual vacancy in the Senate, but decided against it, partly due to the likelihood that this could place him in direct conflict with his brother if Peter became Treasurer. Costello was an elected delegate at the Australian Constitutional Convention in Canberra in February 1998. Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, he was frequently seen in the Australian national media commenting on gambling and other social problems. He also has spoken out in favour of stronger gun control in Australia, acting at times as the co- chairman or spokesman of the National Coalition for Gun Control. = World Vision Australia = Costello was appointed as CEO of World Vision Australia on 24 November 2003. Having spent much of his career focussing on local and domestic issues, Costello said he relished the opportunity to focus on international issues. In his first full year in the role, Costello became the face of Australia's response to the Boxing Day Tsunami. Costello led fundraising efforts, and World Vision Australia raised over $118 million for relief and rehabilitation programs. During Costello's tenure, the organisation grew from funding 480 projects benefiting 10.4 million people, to more than 800 World Vision development projects benefiting close to 100 million people across the globe including in Australia. After 13 years as CEO, Costello announced that he was stepping aside to become the Chief Advocate for World Vision Australia on 9 May 2016. He remained as Chief Advocate for a further two years before resigning on 7 June 2019, citing the physical and emotional toll of the role over many years. Costello has since become the Director of Ethical Voice, Executive Director of Micah Australia and a Senior Fellow at Centre for Public Christianity. He is also Chair of the Community Council of Australia and an Advocate for the Alliance for Gambling Reform. Awards and honours Costello received the Victorian of the Year award in July 2004 in recognition of his public and community service. He was made an officer of the Order of Australia in June 2005 and was the Victorian nominee for the Australian of the Year award in 2006. He is the 2008 winner of the Australian Peace Prize awarded by the Peace Organisation of Australia. He is also listed by the National Trust as a \\"National Living Treasure\\". In 2008, Costello received an honorary doctorate from the Australian Catholic University in recognition of \\"his contributions to religious life and social justice\\".

The company sold import games, toys, figures, anime-related items, and obscure adapters and controllers for various game platforms. Lik Sang closed as of October 24, 2006, as a result of multiple lawsuits filed against them by Sony.  History  =Launch= Lik-Sang was established in 1998 in Hong Kong. It became well known for its sales of modchips for game consoles that enabled the normally locked-down consoles to play import and homebrew games (and, as a consequence unlicensed copies of commercial games). The \\"modchips\\" were not all physical chips; they included devices such as flash cartridges that allow Game Boy users to upload ROMs and homebrew applications onto the device, and play them as if it were a regular gaming cartridge. =Legal Troubles= In 2002, the company was sued by major game console producers, such as Sony Computer Entertainment, Nintendo, and Microsoft, alleging contributory copyright infringement, since the mod chips (and other related devices) enabled playing of unauthorized game titles on those consoles. The court granted injunctions preventing Lik-Sang from selling these devices. After these suits, Lik-Sang began expanding its area of expertise by reinventing itself (under a new owner) as a vendor of legitimate, but obscure, accessories, such as consumer electronics, games, merchandise, and t-shirts. =Partnering with Independent Developers= Lik-Sang was a strong supporter of the Dreamcast Community, in 2003 they partnered with Dreamcast-Scene (DCS) and GOAT Store to promote independently developed games, they had an exclusive deal with GOAT Store that made them the sole distributor of all independently released games until their demise in 2006. With GOAT Store Publishing they distributed 4 games offering free shipping all over the world. =Closure= In August 2005, the company was once again in legal trouble, this time from Sony. Lik-Sang had imported PSPs from areas where they were available, and re-exported them to UK customers before the UK release date, which Sony alleged was a breach of their trademark rights. Lik-Sang continued shipping PSPs, claiming Hong Kong's trademark law follows the principle of international exhaustion of trademark rights and therefore allows an item to be traded freely once it appears in a market anywhere in the world. On October 18, 2006, the High Court in London (Patents Court) ruled the shipments were indeed in breach of Sony's rights. The following day, Lik-Sang posted a message on their website claiming they had been forced out of business due to Sony's legal action. Sony responded in a statement saying that Lik-Sang had not contested the case, thus incurring no legal fees, and had not paid any damages or costs to Sony. However, Lik-Sang replied once more that their legal representatives spent over a year to contest the UK's court jurisdiction and tried to defend against Sony's allegations of parallel importation and copyright infringement, and that Sony launched duplicate actions in different countries. According to Lik-Sang's final statements, two different judges expressed their surprise about the high legal expenses claimed by Sony. Since October 24, 2006, Lik-Sang's website has been offline, the only page remaining being that of a letter to former customers in regards to the ruling, and the circumstances surrounding it. The Lik-Sang forums have also been closed down. As of 2014, the Lik-Sang website simply redirects to this article. Court decisions against Lik Sang The following decisions against Lik Sang can be read on-line: * SCEI v Lik Sang International Ltd (High Court of Hong Kong, 2003) * Nintendo v Lik Sang International Ltd (High Court of Hong Kong, 2003) * SCEI v Pacific Game Technology (UK Patents Court, 2006) Legacy Lik-Sang is widely known in console gaming circles. Some even form a verb with the name, as in \\"I could Lik-Sang the controller if I had the money\\", and cult game site Penny Arcade often spoke about Lik-Sang and featured them in their webcomics.

He worked with a string of producers in the years that followed, including Joe Gibbs (\\"Mash Up Illiteracy\\", \\"Pretty Girl\\"), Gussie Clarke (\\"Love\\"), Winston \\"Niney\\" Holness (\\"Rascal Man\\"), Harry J (\\"Ask The Lonely\\"), and Joseph Hoo Kim (\\"It's a Shame\\"). In 1976, he recorded a cover of The Wailers' \\"I'm Still Waiting\\" for Lloyd Charmers, which was hugely popular, and enjoyed some cross-over success, and was followed by the album Sarge, which is considered one of his strongest. Also a Bob Andy produced song, \\"The Last Thing on My Mind\\" rose to number one in Jamaica. Wilson continued to be successful until the end of the decade, but his career floundered during the early 1980s, with releases less common. His fortunes revived in the digital age with releases for King Jammy (\\"Don't Put The Blame on Me\\") and Bunny Lee (\\"Ease Up\\"), with new albums following, but he again drifted out of the limelight, with his health declining, and is best remembered for his earlier work. Wilson is referenced by The Clash in their 1978 track \\"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais\\".

Bush for geopolitical reasons just as the first flight- test missile was delivered. The mission of the SRAM family is to deliver the warhead to the target without the need for the penetrating bomber to directly overfly the target. The SRAM family of weapons had an extremely small radar signature and were near-impossible to counter. SRAM ensured the airborne leg of the US nuclear triad (the others being land-based ICBMs and SLBM) and was the penetrating airlaunched strategic nuclear weapon for the B-1 Lancer and B-2 Spirit. In 1977, the USAF planned to develop an upgrade of the SRAM for the forthcoming B-1A bomber as AGM-69B SRAM B. When the B-1A was cancelled in 1978, the AGM-69B was dropped, too. After the resurrection of the B-1 program (as B-1B) in 1981, it was decided to develop an entirely new weapon, the SRAM II. In 1986, Boeing was finally awarded a development contract for the AGM-131A SRAM II. The AGM-131A was planned to have only about 2/3 the size of an AGM-69A, so that 36 missiles could be carried by the B-1B, as compared to 24 AGM-69As. The final design of the SRAM II ended up with the \\"II\\" version roughly equal to the \\"A\\" version in size and about 80% of the weight. One new feature of SRAM II was a lighter, simpler, and more reliable two-pulse solid rocket motor designed by Hercules for increased range and age stability. The SRAM II was slated to use the newly developed W89 thermonuclear warhead, which being much newer, was also much safer to operate than the W-69 of the AGM-69. The W89 had a 200 kiloton design yield, Initial Operational Capability for the AGM-131A was planned for 1993, but before flight tests could take place, the program was cancelled in 1991. SRAM-T The SRAM II air vehicle was also the basis for a tactical nuclear variant - the SRAM T which employed a different warhead, the W91 thermonuclear warhead, with a selectable yield from 10 to 100 kilotons. It had a longer range than the baseline SRAM II, around 250 miles (approximately 400 kilometers). As a NATO theater nuclear weapon, SRAM-T was to be carried by the F-15E and F-111, but it was also compatible with the F-16 and the Tornado. Deployment was planned for 1995. Cancellation Both SRAM II and SRAM T were canceled in September 1991 by President George H.W. Bush, along with the W89 and W91 warheads.

Organizational ecology utilizes insights from biology, economics,Douma, Sytse and Hein Schreuder, 2013. \\"Economic Approaches to Organizations\\". 5th edition. London: Pearson ‚Ä¢ and sociology, and employs statistical analysis to try to understand the conditions under which organizations emerge, grow, and die. The ecology of organizations is divided into three levels, the community, the population, and the organization. The community level is the functionally integrated system of interacting populations. The population level is the set of organizations engaged in similar activities. The organization level focuses on the individual organizations (some research further divides organizations into individual member and sub-unit levelsHannan, M., & Freeman, J. (1977). The population ecology of organizations. American Journal of Sociology 82(5), 929‚Äì964.). What is generally referred to as organizational ecology in research is more accurately population ecology, focusing on the second level.Baum, J., & Shipilov, A. (2006). Ecological approaches to organizations. In S. Clegg, C. Hardy, T. Lawrence, & W. Nord (Eds.) The Sage handbook of organization studies (pp. 55‚Äì110.) London: Sage Publications.  Development  Wharton School researcher William Evan called the population level the organization-set, and focused on the interrelations of individual organizations within the population as early as 1966.Evan, W. (1966). \\"The organization-set\\" in J. Thompson (ed.) Approaches to Organizational Design. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press. However, prior to the mid-1970s, the majority of organizational studies research focused on adaptive change in organizations (See also adaptive management and adaptive performance). The ecological approach moved focus to the environmental selection processes that affect organizations. In 1976, Eric Trist defined population ecology as \\"the study of the organizational field created by a number of organizations whose interrelations compose a system at the level of the whole field\\". He also advocated for organizational studies research to focus on populations and individual organizations as part of open rather than closed systems that have both bureaucratic (internal) regulation and ecological (community environment) regulation (see also Open and closed systems in social science).Trist, E. (1977). A Concept of Organizational Ecology. Australian Journal of Management 2(2), 161‚Äì175. The first explicit formulation of a theory of population ecology, by Michael T. Hannan and the late John H. Freeman in their 1977 American Journal of Sociology piece \\"The population ecology of organizations\\" and later refined in their 1989 book Organizational Ecology, examines the environment in which organizations compete and how a process like natural selection occurs. This theory looks at the death of organizations (firm mortality), the birth of new organizations (organizational founding), as well as organizational growth and change. Organizational ecology has over the years become one of the central fields in organizational studies, and is known for its empirical, quantitative character. Ecological studies usually have a large-scale, longitudinal focus (datasets often span several decades, sometimes even centuries). The books The Demography of Corporations and Industries by Glenn Carroll and Michael T. Hannan (2000) and Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Codes, and Ecologies by Michael T. Hannan, Laszlo Polos, and Glenn Carroll (2007), provide the most comprehensive overview of the various theories and methods in organizational ecology.  Key concerns  Organizational ecology focuses on how social (community) forces affect: * rates of creation of new organizational forms * rates of demise of organizations and organizational forms * the rates of change in organizational forms.Singh, J., & Lumsden, C. (1990). Theory and research in organizational ecology. Annual Review of Sociology 16(1), 161‚Äì195. = Organizational mortality = Organizational ecology is concerned with the capacity of the environment to support organizations and the rate of growth and decline of organizations within the environment. Each of these forces is a part of what is called Organizational Mortality.  Inertia and change  This factor holds that organizations that are reliable and accountable are those that can survive (favored by selection). A negative by-product, however, of the need for reliability and accountability is a high degree of inertia and a resistance to change. A key prediction of organizational ecology is that the process of change itself is so disruptive that it will result in an elevated rate of mortality. Theories about inertia and change are fundamental to the research program of organizational ecology, which seeks a better understanding of the broader changes in the organizational landscape. Both internal and external resistance to change can result in organizational inertia, providing some resistance to organizational adaptation. Given the limits on firm-level adaptation, most of these broader changes thus come from the entry and selective replacement of organizations. Hence organizational ecology has spent considerable effort on understanding the founding and mortality rates of organizations. Hannan and Freeman define organizational inertia in terms of internal and external restraints. Internal restraints include investment and sunk costs; availability of information for decision makers; political restraints such as organizational culture; and organization history. External restraints include legal and fiscal barriers to market entry and exit; availability of information about the environment; external legitimacy; and collective rationality and strategy (See also Bounded rationality).  Niche theory  Niche width distinguishes broadly between two types of organizations: generalists and specialists. Specialist organizations maximize their exploitation of the environment and accept the risk of experiencing a change in that environment. On the other hand, generalist organizations accept a lower level of exploitation in return for greater security. Niche theory shows that specialization is generally favored in stable or certain environments. However, the main contribution of the niche theory is probably the finding that \\"generalism is not always optimal in uncertain environments\\". The exception is produced by environments which \\"place very different demands on the organization, and the duration of environmental states is short relative to the life of the organization\\". Thus, the niche theory explains variations in industrial structure in different industries. The theory shows how different structures in different industries (generalist vs specialist organizations) are shaped by relevant environments.  Density dependence  Organizational ecology also predicts that the rates of founding and mortality are dependent on the number of organizations (density) in the market. The two central mechanisms here are legitimization (the recognition or taken-for-grantedness of that group of organizations) and competition. Legitimization generally increases (at a decreasing rate) with the number of organizations, but so does competition (at an increasing rate). The result is that legitimization processes will prevail at low numbers of organizations, while competition will at high numbers. The founding rate will therefore first increase with the number of organizations (due to an increase in legitimization) but will decrease at high numbers of organizations (due to competition). The reverse holds for mortality rates. Thus, the relationship of density to founding rates has an inverted U shape and the relationship of density to mortality rates follows a U-shaped pattern.Carroll, G. (1984). Organizational ecology. Annual Review of Sociology 10(1), 71‚Äì93.  Age dependence  How an organization's risk of mortality relates to the age of that organization has also been extensively examined. Here, organizational ecologists have found a number of patterns: * Liability of newness. Here, the risk of failure is high initially but declines as the organization ages. * Liability of adolescence. The risk of mortality will be low at first as the organization is buffered from failure due to support by external constituents and initial endowments. But when these initial resources become depleted, the mortality hazard shoots up and then declines following the liability of newness pattern. * Liabilities of aging. Here, the risk of failure increases with organizational age. This could be due to a liability of senescence (internal inefficiencies arising from the aging of the organization) or a liability of obsolescence (a growing external mismatch with the environment).  Evolutionary approaches to organizations  Organizational ecology can be usefully compared with evolutionary theories in economics (e.g. Nelson & Winter, 1982). Hannan and Freeman also note the influences of biological ecology and economic evolution on their population ecology model (specifically Elton, 1927; Durkheim, 1947; Hawley, 1950; and Hutchison, 1959). Main similarities between these strands of literature are: (1) the emphasis on organizational routines and the limits to organizational adaptability, (2) the population or system level of analysis and (3) the importance of environmental selection. Organizational ecology's perspective is more Darwinistic (see Hannan & Freeman, 1989, pp 20‚Äì22), while Nelson & Winter (1982, p. 11) provide a more Lamarckian perspective. Another important difference concerns the question: What is selected by the environment-- 'organizational forms', as in organizational ecology, or 'routines' as in the evolutionary economics literature? Authors like Joel Baum and Arjen van Witteloostuijn have argued for the potential of cross-fertilization between these two research strands. A social networks perspective on the evolution of large scale interfirm organizational networks was presented by Braha et al.Braha, Dan, Blake Stacey, and Yaneer Bar-Yam, 2011. ‚ÄúCorporate competition: A self-organized network‚Äù , Social Networks 33 (3): 219‚Äì230. who propose micro-dynamic models that reproduce actual large-scale interfirm perceived competition networks. Several evolutionary mechanisms of organizational networks are identified: spatial locations of firms are positively correlated with the population density; interfirm competition is governed by cumulative advantage rules and geographic distance; and competition network formation and firm size dynamics are closely intertwined.

A turn is a collective direction of research, focused on some coherent sets of concepts, theories, and ideas, which represent a point of bifurcation for the field itself. Most turns in organization studies relate to broader ones in social sciences and humanities. Researchers studying organizations and/or organizing processes have a recurring concern that those who work in organizations do not find organizational research particularly relevant. There is therefore growing interest in the impact of organization studies. Public administrations also, around the world, are adopting massively new organizational models to increase their efficiency and improve public services. The Organization Studies field is becoming more popular also because the borders between a well-defined organization and customers, citizens, businesses and professionals are more and more undefined.

It was founded in 1950 by John Chamberlain, Henry Hazlitt, and Suzanne La Follette. The magazine was purchased by a FEE-owned company in 1954, and FEE took over direct control of the magazine in 1956. In September 2016, FEE announced it would permanently end publication of The Freeman. Background A number of earlier publications had used the Freeman name, some of which were intellectual predecessors to the magazine founded in 1950. =The Freeman (1920‚Äì1924)= From 1920 to 1924, Albert Jay Nock, a libertarian author and social critic, edited a weekly magazine called The Freeman. Nock's magazine was funded by co- editor Francis Neilson, a British author and former member of Parliament, and his wife Helen Swift Neilson, who was heir to a meatpacking fortune. The Neilsons had previously provided funding to The Nation when Nock was a writer there. Nock got fellow Nation writer Suzanne La Follette to join his new venture as an assistant editor, with Walter Fuller (the husband of Crystal Eastman) as managing editor. Other contributors included Conrad Aiken, Charles A. Beard, William Henry Chamberlin, John Dos Passos, Thomas Mann, Lewis Mumford, Bertrand Russell, Carl Sandburg, Lincoln Steffans, Louis Untermeyer, and Thorstein Veblen. La Follette revived the periodical as The New Freeman in March 1930, but the revival was discontinued a year later. =The Freeman (1937‚Äì1942)= In 1937, Frank Chodorov began another magazine called The Freeman, this time a monthly magazine promoting the philosophy of Henry George and published by the Henry George School of Social Science. It was explicitly not a revival of Nock's magazine, but Nock was an occasional contributor. In 1942, Chodorov was dismissed by the Henry George School over political differences, primarily that Chodorov remained openly critical of the political act of war, and in 1943 the magazine was renamed the Henry George News. In 1939, Leonard Read, then a manager for the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, created a small publishing house called Pamphleteers, Inc., for the purpose of publishing pro-liberty works, starting with Give Me Liberty by Rose Wilder Lane. Pamphleteers used \\"The Freeman\\" as the overall name of their book series. Early years The new magazine to be called The Freeman was founded in 1950 through the efforts of John Chamberlain, Henry Hazlitt, and Isaac Don Levine. Chamberlain and Hazlitt wrote for the anti-communist magazine Plain Talk, where Levine was editor. All three were dissatisfied with the negative approach of opposing communism and wanted a project that would spread a more positive message. They pulled together $200,000 in funding with help from textile importer Alfred Kohlberg (one of the funders of Plain Talk), DuPont executive Jasper Crane, Sun Oil president J. Howard Pew, and former United States President Herbert Hoover. Levine dropped out before publication began, so Chamberlain and Hazlitt brought in La Follette, who had worked on Nock's Freeman and also at Plain Talk. The board of the new publication included advertising executive Lawrence Fertig, legal scholar Roscoe Pound, and economists Ludwig von Mises and Leo Wolman. Also on the board was Read, who in 1946 had founded the Foundation for Economic Education. The magazine launched in October 1950 with 6,000 subscribers, mostly brought over from Plain Talk, which had ceased publication that May. It was expected to be a for-profit operation, and by 1952 it had reached 22,000 subscribers and was almost able to sustain itself. However, internal disagreements over politics destabilized the operation. Chamberlain and La Follette had staked out positions in favor of Senator Joseph McCarthy, a strident crusader against communism, and Senator Robert A. Taft, a candidate in the Republican presidential primary that year. These positions led to conflicts with Hazlitt and members of the board. Hazlitt quit the magazine in October 1952, but by February 1953 both Chamberlain and La Follette had left, and Hazlitt returned as sole editor. He resigned again at the start of 1954. Transfer to FEE By June 1954 the magazine had lost $400,000 and was on the verge of closure. Rather than let it fold, Read decided to purchase the magazine. He created a new for-profit company, Irvington Press, with FEE as its owner, and Irvington purchased The Freeman. He brought in Chodorov, former editor of the unrelated Georgist Freeman, as the new editor, starting with the July 1954 issue. Chodorov focused the magazine more on economic issues, taking more explicit libertarian stances than the previous editors. He also promoted a non-interventionist foreign policy, which stirred debate with more traditional conservatives. Although the content was different, the magazine continued to lose money, costing $90,000 in 18 months. Unable to stop the magazine from losing money, Read turned it over to the non-profit FEE. It became the foundation's primary outreach tool. With a new format and a new focus, the magazine became more successful. Within two years it had reached 42,000 subscribers, and FEE's donor base had more than doubled. Name In 1955, FEE introduced a quarterly magazine called Ideas on Liberty. When FEE acquired The Freeman, the two were merged and named The Freeman: Ideas on Liberty. In January 2000, the magazine was renamed Ideas on Liberty, although it retained the format and content that it had had since the merger. The dual title was restored with the December 2003 issue. From the October 2012 issue, the magazine was titled just The Freeman, with no subtitle. In fall 2015, FEE removed the Freeman branding from its web articles, and the Freeman referred exclusively to the then-quarterly print magazine. Influence The Freeman is widely considered to be an important forerunner to the conservative publication National Review magazine, which was founded in 1955, and which from its inception included many of the same contributing editors.Chamberlain, John, A Life with the Printed Word, 1982, Regnery, pp.141, 145-146. During its more than half century of publication, The Freeman featured articles by economists, businessmen, professors, teachers, statesmen (domestic and foreign), students, housewives, free-lance writers, and budding libertarian intellectuals. Many of its authors went on to become noted authors, teachers, and founders of libertarian organizations.

Little is known of him or his kingdom from this early era, with only a few anecdotal mentions of him in historical documents. Iago ap Beli (Latin: Iacobus Belii filius; ) was the son and successor of King Beli ap Rhun, and is listed in the royal genealogies of the Harleian genealogies and in Jesus College MS. 20. -- the pedigree is given as: ... map Rotri map mermin map etthil merch cinnan map rotri map Intguaul map Catgualart map Catgollaun map Catman map Iacob map Beli map Run ..., and from there back to Cunedda and his ancestors. -- the pedigree is given as ...

The only other record of him is the note of his death, which occurred in the same year as the Battle of Chester (), with no connection between Iago's death and the famous battle,, Annales Cambriae, \\"Gueith cair legion. et ibi cecidit selim filii cinan. et iacob filii beli dormitatio\\". The year given is 613, but 616 is now considered to be correct. and with no evidence that Gwynedd had any part in the battle., A History of Wales, Vol. I He would be succeeded as king by his son, Cadfan ap Iago. The 1766 publication of Henry Rowlands's Mona Antiqua Restaurata says that the archives of the cathedral at Bangor mention Iago as having founded a deanery there ('Iago ap Beli Rex Decanatu Ecclesiam ditavit'). However, the correctness of the archive's assertion is challenged in Haddan and Stubbs' authoritative Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents Relating to Great Britain and Ireland, where it is noted that \\"the earliest historical testimony to a Dean at Bangor is 1162\\". In the medieval Welsh Triads, the death of King Iago ap Beli is described as the result of an axe-blow by one of his own men, a certain Cadafael Wyllt ()., article on The Poems of Taliesin In his Celtic Britain, John Rhys notes that the Annals of Tigernach mention Iago's death and use the word dormitat (or dormitato, meaning sleep in the sense of a euphemism for death), contradicting the notion of a violent death. Further, as the word dormitato was generally used in reference to clerics, it is possible that Iago resigned his kingship and thereafter led a clerical life., The Kymry, in footnote 2.  Geoffrey of Monmouth  The largely fictional stories of ancient Britain written by Geoffrey of Monmouth use the names of many historical personages as characters, and the use of these names is a literary convenience made in order to advance the plot of Geoffrey's stories. One of these stories uses the names of Iago's son Cadfan and other contemporary people, telling of how a certain Edwin spent his exiled youth in Gwynedd, growing up alongside Iago's grandson, the future King Cadwallon. There is no historical basis for this story, as is readily acknowledged in the preface of works on the subject. Nevertheless, a \\"traditional\\" story arose blending Geoffrey's fiction with known history, implying that the future King Edwin of Northumbria had actually spent his youth in Gwynedd, growing up alongside Iago's grandson, the future King Cadwallon. In point of fact, Cadwallon and Edwin were enemies with no known youthful connections: King Edwin invaded Gwynedd and drove King Cadwallon into exile, and it would be Cadwallon, in alliance with Penda of Mercia, who would ultimately defeat and kill Edwin in 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase (). The story that they had spent an idyllic youth together may have had a romantic appeal. What is known from history is that in 588 King √Ülla of Deira died, and √Üthelfrith of Bernicia took the opportunity to invade and conquer Deira, driving √Ülla 's 3-year old infant son, the future Edwin of Northumbria, into exile. Edwin would eventually ally himself with R√¶dwald of East Anglia in 616, defeating and killing √Üthelfrith and becoming one of Northumbria's most successful kings. Edwin's life in exile is unknown, and there is no historical basis for placing him in Gwynedd.

Volatile memory has several uses including as primary storage. In addition to usually being faster than forms of mass storage such as a hard disk drive, volatility can protect sensitive information, as it becomes unavailable on power-down. Most of the general-purpose random-access memory (RAM) is volatile. Types There are two kinds of volatile RAM: dynamic and static. Even though both types need continuous electrical current to retain data, there are some important differences between them. Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is very popular due to its cost effectiveness. DRAM stores each bit of information in a different capacitor within the integrated circuit. DRAM chips need just one single capacitor and one transistor to store each bit of information. This makes it space efficient and inexpensive. The main advantage of static RAM (SRAM) is that it is much faster than dynamic RAM. Its disadvantage is its high price. SRAM does not need continuous electrical refreshes, but it still requires constant current to sustain the difference in voltage. Every single bit in a static RAM chip needs a cell of six transistors, whereas dynamic RAM requires only one capacitor and one transistor. As a result, SRAM is unable to accomplish the storage capabilities of the DRAM family. SRAM is commonly used as CPU cache and for processor registers and in networking devices.

His landmark recordings completed between 1927 and 1930‚Äîthirty songs in total‚Äîdisplay a combination of powerful \\"chest voice\\" singing, slide guitar skills, and originality that has influenced later generations of musicians. Even though Johnson's records sold well, as a street performer and preacher, he had little wealth in his lifetime. His life was poorly documented, but over time, music historians such as Samuel Charters have uncovered more about Johnson and his five recording sessions. A revival of interest in Johnson's music began in the 1960s, following his inclusion on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, and by the efforts of the blues guitarist Reverend Gary Davis. Johnson's work has become more accessible through compilation albums such as American Epic: The Best of Blind Willie Johnson and the Charters compilations. As a result, Johnson is credited as one of the most influential practitioners of the blues, and his slide guitar playing, particularly on his hymn \\"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\\", is highly acclaimed. Other recordings by Johnson include \\"Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed\\", \\"It's Nobody's Fault but Mine\\", and \\"John the Revelator\\".  Biography  =Early life and career= Johnson was born on January 25, 1897, in Pendleton, Texas, a small town near Temple, Texas, to sharecropper George Johnson (also identified as Willie Johnson Sr.) and his wife, Mary Fields, who died in 1901. His family, which according to the blues historian Steven Calt included at least one younger brother named Carl, moved to the agriculturally rich community of Marlin, where Johnson spent most of his childhood. There, the Johnson family attended church‚Äîmost likely the Marlin Missionary Baptist Church‚Äîevery Sunday, a practice which had a lasting impact on Johnson and fueled his desire to be ordained as a Baptist minister. When Johnson was five years old, his father gave him his first instrument‚Äîa cigar box guitar. Johnson was not born blind, though he was impaired with the disability at an early age. It is uncertain how he lost his sight, but it is generally agreed by most biographers of Johnson that he was blinded by his stepmother when he was seven years old, a claim that was first made by Johnson's purported widow Angeline Johnson. In her recollection, Willie's father had violently confronted Willie's stepmother about her infidelity, and during the argument she splashed Willie with a caustic solution of lye water, permanently blinding him. Other theories have also been developed to explain Johnson's visual impairment, including that he wore the wrong spectacles, that he viewed a partial solar eclipse that was observable over Texas in 1905 or a combination of the two conjectures. Few other details are known about the singer's childhood. At some point he met another blind musician, Madkin Butler, who had a powerful singing and preaching style that influenced Johnson's own vocal delivery and repertoire. Adam Booker, a blind minister interviewed by the blues historian Samuel Charters in the 1950s, recalled that while visiting his father in Hearne, Johnson would perform religious songs on street corners with a tin cup tied to the neck of his Stella guitar to collect money. Occasionally, Johnson would play on the same street as Blind Lemon Jefferson, but the extent of the two songsters' involvement with each other is unknown. In 1926 or early 1927, Johnson established an unregistered marriage with Willie B. Harris, who occasionally sang on the street with him and at benefits for the Marlin Church of God in Christ with Johnson accompanied on piano. From the relationship, Johnson had a daughter, Sam Faye Johnson Kelly, in 1931. The blues guitarist L. C. Robinson recalled that his sister Anne also claimed to have been married to Johnson in the late 1920s. =Recording sessions (1927‚Äì1930)= By the time Johnson began his recording career, he was a well-known evangelist with a \\"remarkable technique and a wide range of songs\\", as noted by the blues historian Paul Oliver. On December 3, 1927, Johnson was assembled along with Billiken Johnson and Coley Jones at a temporary studio that talent scout Frank Buckley Walker had set up in the Deep Ellum neighborhood in Dallas to record for Columbia Records. In the ensuing session, Johnson played six selections, 13 takes in total, and was accompanied by Willie B. Harris on his first recording, \\"I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole\\". Among the other songs Johnson recorded in Dallas were \\"Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed\\", \\"It's Nobody's Fault but Mine\\", \\"Mother's Children Have a Hard Time\\", \\"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\\", and \\"If I Had My Way I'd Tear the Building Down\\". He was compensated with $50 per \\"usable\\" side‚Äîa substantial amount for the period‚Äîand a bonus to forfeit royalties from sales of the records. The first songs to be released were \\"I Know His Blood Can Make Me Whole\\" and \\"Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed\\", on Columbia's popular 14000 Race series. Johnson's debut became a substantial success, as 9,400 copies were pressed, more than the latest release by one of Columbia's most established stars, Bessie Smith, and an additional pressing of 6,000 copies followed. His fifth recorded song, \\"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\\", eventually the B-side of Johnson's second release, best exemplifies his unique guitar playing in open D tuning for slide. For the session, Johnson substituted a knife or penknife for the bottleneck and‚Äîaccording to Harris‚Äîhe played with a thumb pick. His melancholy, indecipherable humming of the guitar part creates the impression of \\"unison moaning\\", a style of singing hymns that is common in southern African-American church choirs. In 1928, the blues critic Edward Abbe Niles praised Johnson in his column for The Bookman, emphasizing his \\"violent, tortured, and abysmal shouts and groans, and his inspired guitar playing\\". Johnson, accompanied by Harris, returned to Dallas on December 5, 1928, to record \\"I'm Gonna Run to the City of Refuge\\", \\"Jesus Is Coming Soon\\", \\"Lord I Just Can't Keep From Crying\\", and \\"Keep Your Lamp Trimmed and Burning\\". Two unreleased and untitled tracks were also recorded by Johnson under the pseudonym Blind Texas Marlin, but the master recordings of the session have never been recovered. Another year passed before Johnson recorded again, on December 10 and 11, 1929, the longest sessions of his career. He completed ten sides in 16 takes at Werlein's Music Store in New Orleans, also recording some duets with an unknown female singer, who is thought to have been a member of Reverend J. M. Gates's congregation, according to Johnson's biographer D. N. Blakey. The blind street performer Dave Ross reported hearing Johnson performing on the street in New Orleans in December 1929. According to a story heard by the jazz historian Richard Allen, Johnson was arrested while performing in front of the Custom House on Canal Street, for allegedly attempting to incite a riot with his impassioned rendition of \\"If I Had My Way I'd Tear the Building Down\\". For his fifth and final recording session, Johnson journeyed to Atlanta, Georgia, with Harris returning to provide vocal harmonies. Ten selections were completed on April 20, 1930. \\"Everybody Ought to Treat a Stranger Right\\" paired with \\"Go with Me to That Land\\" were chosen as the first single released from the session. However, the Great Depression had wiped out much of Johnson's audience, and consequently only 800 copies were pressed. Some of his songs were re-released by Vocalion Records in 1932, but Johnson never recorded again. =Later life and death= Johnson allegedly remarried, this time to Angeline Johnson, in the early 1930s, but, as with Harris, it is unlikely that the union was officially registered. Throughout the Great Depression and the 1940s, he performed in several cities and towns in Texas, including Beaumont. A city directory shows that in 1945, a Reverend W. J. Johnson‚Äîundoubtedly Blind Willie‚Äîoperated the House of Prayer at 1440 Forrest Street, in Beaumont. In 1945, his home was destroyed by a fire, but, with nowhere else to go, Johnson continued to live in the ruins of his house, where he was exposed to the humidity. He contracted malarial fever, and no hospital would admit him, either because of his visual impairment, as Angeline Johnson stated in an interview with Charters, or because he was black. Over the course of the year, his condition steadily worsened until he died, on September 18, 1945. His death certificate reported syphilis and blindness as contributing factors. According to his death certificate, he was buried in Blanchette Cemetery, in Beaumont. The location of the cemetery had been forgotten until it was rediscovered in 2009. His grave site remains unknown, but the researchers who identified the cemetery erected a monument there in his honor in 2010. Musical style Johnson is considered one of the masters of blues, particularly of the gospel blues style. Like his contemporary Blind Lemon Jefferson, Johnson channeled the expressiveness of the blues into his religious messages derived from hymnbooks. Samuel Charters, in the liner notes to the compilation album The Complete Blind Willie Johnson, wrote that, in fact, Johnson was not a bluesman in the traditional sense, \\"but here still is so much similarity between his relentless guitar rhythms and his harsh, insistent voice, and the same fierce intensities of the blues singers, that they become images of each other, seen in the mirror of the society that produced them\\". An important aspect of Johnson's recordings was his mastering of the bottleneck guitar technique, which was immediately influential on Robert Johnson and Howlin' Wolf. He punctuated his selections with tonal control and sense of timing, often using the guitar as a part of his harmonic phrasing, particularly on \\"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\\". By most accounts, including one by the reputable blues guitarist Blind Willie McTell, Johnson used a knife as a slide, but other claims by Harris and the bluesman Thom Shaw also state he used a thumb pick or brass ring on his recordings. The music historian Steve Calt said of Johnson's style: \\"opposed to other bottleneck artists he varies the speed of his vibrato drastically, often speeding up as he slides into a note. He is also one of the few bottleneck artists with the ability to consistently sound 3 or 4 discreet melody notes upon striking a string once, a skill that reflects uncanny left-handed strength, accuracy and agility\\". Johnson sang in a harsh, gravelly bass voice that was meant to be powerful enough to be heard by passersby on the streets. His vocal interplay was described by the blues writer Mark Makin as \\"fierce\\" and \\"not unlike the 'Hell and Damnation' of a Baptist preacher such as a fired-up Reverend A. W. Nix\\". On some instances in his recordings, Johnson also delivered vocals in his natural tenor voice. The only known influence on Johnson's singing style is the blind musician Madkin Butler, who, like Johnson, sang his religious message on the streets of Texas cities. Legacy Johnson's music was revived in the 1960s thanks in large part to his inclusion on Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music in 1952 and the efforts of the blues guitarist Reverend Gary Davis, a highly regarded figure in New York's blossoming folk scene. As he taught Johnson's music to young musicians, groups and acts like the Soul Stirrers, the Staples Singers, Buffy Sainte- Marie, Fairport Convention, and Peter, Paul and Mary covered or re-interpreted his work. In November 1962, Bob Dylan recorded a rendition of \\"Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed\\", retitled \\"In My Time of Dying\\", for his self-titled debut album. Rock bands and artists of the 1970s also covered Johnson's songs, including Led Zeppelin, John Sebastian, and Eric Clapton. Alligator Records released the tribute album God Don't Never Change: The Songs of Blind Willie Johnson in 2016 with covers by various artists. All of Johnson's released material has become easily accessible thanks to its preservation on compilation albums such as Blind Willie Johnson 1927‚Äì1930 and The Complete Blind Willie Johnson, among others. Samuel Charters was the first major blues historian to attempt to uncover more about Johnson's life, first documenting him in his 1959 book The Country Blues. In 1993, Charters corrected some factual inaccuracies in Johnson's biography in the liner notes to The Complete Blind Willie Johnson. Other books related to Johnson include Shine a Light: My Year with Blind Willie Johnson and Revelation The Blind Willie Johnson Biography. In 1977, Carl Sagan and a team of researchers were tasked with collecting a representation of Earth and the human experience for sending on the Voyager probe to other life forms in the universe. Among the 27 songs selected for the Voyager Golden Record, \\"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\\" was chosen by NASA consultant Timothy Ferris because, according to Ferris, \\"Johnson's song concerns a situation he faced many times: nightfall with no place to sleep. Since humans appeared on Earth, the shroud of night has yet to fall without touching a man or woman in the same plight\\". Johnson's recording of \\"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground\\" was also selected by the Library of Congress as a 2010 addition to the National Recording Registry, which selects recordings annually that are deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". In 2017, the story of Blind Willie Johnson‚Äôs inclusion on the Voyager probe was told in the multi-award winning 2017 documentary series American Epic directed by Bernard MacMahon. The film was accompanied by a compilation album, American Epic: The Best of Blind Willie Johnson, featuring radically improved restorations of sixteen of Johnson‚Äôs recordings.

It was designed by Manuel Hornibrook and built from 1932 to 1935 by Manuel Hornibrook. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 October 1994. Handsome art-deco concrete abutment arches frame the entry and exit approaches. Construction of the bridge was important for the growth of the Redcliffe City peninsula and made the commute to Brisbane shorter and quicker, increasing population growth and the number of visitors to the seaside location. The bridge was known colloquially by the locals as the \\"Humpity Bump\\" because the road surface of the bridge was so buckled. During king tides, waves would crash into (and sometimes onto) the bridge spraying the cars as they crossed. The bridge was operated and maintained by a private company and a toll applied until 1975, with toll booths located on the Clontarf (north) end. The Hornibrook Bridge was the first of three bridges to cross Bramble Bay. The second bridge is the publicly funded (non-tolled) Houghton Highway bridge, which was built with the intention of duplicating the crossing capacity of the two-lane Hornibrook Bridge in the 1970s, but the upgrading of the original Hornibrook Bridge was subsequently found to be uneconomic. The bridge closed to traffic in 1979 with the opening of the Houghton Highway, which had been intended to provide a duplicated crossing. The third bridge, the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge opened to traffic in July 2010, delivering the desired capacity increase and resulting in the demolition of the original Hornibrook Bridge, which had been used as a pedestrian and bicycle only bridge since 1979. History Manuel Hornibrook, 1954 Building the bridge, 1933 During construction, 1935 The Hornibrook Highway Bridge was constructed in the years 1932‚Äì1935, by the firm of M.R. Hornibrook. Conceived as a response to high unemployment during the Great Depression, it also represented an opportunity to end the isolation of the residents of the Redcliffe Peninsula. Prior to the construction of the Hornibrook Viaduct, the Redcliffe Peninsula was accessed via two main methods of transport: ferry and road. Road transportation in particular was of great concern to the residents of the Redcliffe area. During times of wet weather, the Redcliffe road running via Petrie regularly became impassable to vehicles. Several schemes had been drafted to improve the accessibility of the Redcliffe area to vehicle owners and also to the growing day-tripper market, having seaside holidays at Redcliffe. These schemes favoured the construction of a new road link across Hays Inlet and the mouth of the South Pine River. In 1926, the Redcliffe Town Council had proposed such a project be considered by the Main Roads Board. Such a road link would involve crossing of water by viaduct at a cost of . This road would then connect with the main road from Sandgate to Brisbane, avoiding the long drive via Petrie. M.R. Hornibrook had holidayed in this area and saw the development potential of the Redcliffe area being linked by road to Brisbane. The onset of the financial depression of 1929-1933 gave Hornibrook the impetus to plan and construct a road viaduct across from Redcliffe to Sandgate. Major contracts for construction diminished with the deepening depression, and the decline in public spending. Hornibrook believed a major project was needed to keep together the construction force built up by his company during twenty-five years of work. In 1931, Hornibrook approached the Queensland Government with a proposal to construct a toll bridge linking the southern part of Redcliffe with the Sandgate area. Initially, this proposal was rejected. After further consultation with the Queensland Government, an Act of Parliament was pushed through allowing for the involvement of private enterprise in the construction of toll facilities. Note that the Queensland Government was also in discussions with Walter Taylor regarding his proposal to construct a toll bridge (later known as the Walter Taylor Bridge) across the Brisbane River between Indooroopilly and Chelmer. The terms of the contract with the Queensland Government set the toll price, as well as stipulating the length of lease. Hornibrook negotiated successfully for a forty-year lease on the projected road bridge. The full extent of the project involved a road viaduct in length plus associated roadworks. To finance such a major construction, a prospectus was issued to encourage local investment in Hornibrook Highway Ltd. Work officially commenced on the project on 8 June 1932, but in its first eighteen months progress was limited, due to a lack of financing. The entry portals at either end of the bridge were completed in early 1933. Continuing financial difficulties forced Hornibrook to attempt to re-finance the company to finish the work as planned by 1935. The major flotation was assisted by a loan from the AMP Society, guaranteed by the Queensland Government. Work recommenced at a faster pace from July 1934. The portals were designed by architect John Beebe. Originally a Bendigo-based architect, Beebe moved to Queensland in 1916, and worked at the Queensland Works Department until 1926. He then moved into private practice in Brisbane until 1936. Over 2.5 million superfeet of timber was needed to provide girders and decking on the bridge. Two sawmills were bought specially to process timber from Mount Mee and Conondale Range. 250 timbergetters were employed to cut the required amount of timber. Timber for the construction of the bridge was transported down the North Pine and Pine rivers on barges. The hardwood used in piles and girders mostly came from a timber mill owned by the Hornibrook Construction Company at Mapleton, transported from there to Nambour on the Mapleton Tramway, and then by Queensland Rail trains. Concrete was supplied from the QCL works at Darra - the two portals being the first significant structures in Queensland to use material from this source. The last plank on the viaduct was spiked into place on 7 September 1935. The bitumen road surface was laid in under three weeks setting an Australian record. The bridge originally had two traffic lanes and a pedestrian footpath. The construction of the bridge was similar to other bridges in Queensland, but when it was completed it was the longest road viaduct built over water in the Southern Hemisphere. At the time of completion, the bridge had a length of . It was the longest bridge in the Southern Hemisphere, and the second longest in the world after the Maestri Bridge in the United States. Up until its closure to road traffic in 1979, it was the longest vehicular traffic bridge in Australia. Bridge opening, 1935 The viaduct was opened to road traffic on 4 October 1935, foreshortening the road journey by several hours. Also a special coordinated road/rail bus service was inaugurated by the company to convey commuters between Sandgate and Redcliffe. It was officially opened by then Queensland Premier Arthur Edward Moore on 14 October 1935. It was named after Sir Manuel Hornibrook, the chief engineer of the project. Aerial view of cars and pedestrians, 1935 The Hornibrook Highway played an important strategic role during the defence of Australia in World War Two. Military road convoys were able to use the highway to move war material efficiently to points in Queensland. The Hornibrook Highway franchise was surrendered to the Department of Main Roads in 1975 after forty years of operation by the company. From this time the Main Roads Department assumed responsibility for maintaining the structure. By then, the increasing road volumes necessitated the investigation of carrying additional traffic. An additional viaduct was authorised by the Main Roads Department in 1977 to cope with increasing traffic flows to and from the Redcliffe Peninsula. The Houghton Highway as the new bridge was named opened to traffic in 1979. The publicly funded (non-tolled) Houghton Highway bridge was built alongside the Hornibrook Bridge, with the intention of duplicating the capacity. The project had intended to upgrade the Hornibrook Bridge as part of that project, but was subsequently found to be uneconomic. The Hornibrook Bridge was closed to traffic in 1979 with the opening of the Houghton Highway bridge. From 1979, the Hornibrook Bridge was only used as a pedestrian and bicycle bridge, providing the only pedestrian and cycling link between the northern suburbs of Brisbane and the Redcliffe Peninsula. It also became a popular site for recreation and fishing. Although the bridge was heritage-listed in 1994, concerns arose about the cost of ongoing maintenance and whether the Queensland Government or local councils should pay for it. The three bridges from the Clontarf (north) side: Ted Smouth Bridge (left), Houghton Highway (centre) and Hornibrook Bridge (right, being demolished), April 2011 An additional (third) bridge, the Ted Smout Memorial Bridge opened to traffic in July 2010, delivering the desired capacity increase as well as providing pedestrian and cyclist access. As the Hornibrook Bridge was then no longer needed for pedestrian and cyclist access, it was closed on 14 July 2010.Final Curtain for the Hornibrook Highway Before its closure, the Hornibrook Bridge was the longest footbridge in the world. Subsequently, the Poughkeepsie Bridge, located in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States, became the world's longest footbridge. Despite the heritage listing of the Hornibrook Bridge in 1994, safety concerns about the rotting deck timbers led to the decision to demolish most of the bridge in mid 2011, retaining the north and south portals and of bridge at the northern end for use by fishermen. The northern end of the bridge was officially reopened on 14 September 2011 as the Hays Inlet Fishing and Recreation Platform by Craig Wallace, Minister for Main Roads, Fisheries and Marine Infrastructure. The Hornibrook Highway was a major catalyst in accelerating the urban development of the Redcliffe Peninsula and its surrounding area. In its planning, construction and operation it represented a major innovation in construction activities in Queensland at a time of economic crisis.  Description  Pedestrian and cycling bridge, 2005 The Hornibrook Highway Bridge was a long timber and concrete bridge that spanned Hays Inlet and Bramble Bay between Clontarf and Brighton, linking Sandgate to Redcliffe. It had identical rendered concrete portals at each end, and two rises along its length which permit small boats to pass underneath. Southern portal, 2012 The bridge construction comprised a timber superstructure supported by reinforced concrete piers with three concrete piles of varying depths. The superstructure had substantial round ironbark girders on corbels, with girders supporting large section ironbark and tallowwood sawn decking. The decking was covered with coarse aggregate bitumen, and had concrete kerb edging. At each end, the first spans of the superstructure were constructed in ribbed reinforced concrete to protect the bridge from termites and fire. The superstructure had a slight camber that permits periodic tightening of the deck via bolt fixings along the outer girders. The bridge had steel balustrades comprising steel stanchions supporting two circular hollow section rails and ironbark lightpoles along its length. Night safe, 2012 The portals at each end (which still exist) are finely detailed monumental Art Deco structures comprising substantial pylons spanned by a deep spandrel facing landward, and more modestly detailed rectangular frames facing bayward. The pylons have banded rusticated bases on concrete pedestals, with central slot windows with decorative grilles on three sides, surmounted by stepped vertical elements. The spandrel is also banded, and has a rectangular central panel with the words \\"Hornibrook Highway\\" fashioned in raised brass lettering. The portals contain toll facilities, comprising a small office and strong room with night safe in the base of the pylons at each end. Externally these rooms are framed by Art Deco relief patterns. On the approach to the bridge the portals are preceded by smaller free-standing pylons either side of the road.  Heritage listing  Hornibrook Highway Bridge was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 October 1994 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Hornibrook Highway Bridge, constructed 1932‚Äì35, was one of the first road toll facilities in Queensland to be authorised by special act of parliament. It is notable as a major public work constructed by private enterprise at a time of economic depression in Queensland. The bridge was the major impetus for the development of Redcliffe. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The finely detailed monumental portals at each end have aesthetic quality. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. In its planning, construction and operation it represents a major innovation in construction activities in Queensland at a time of economic crisis. Its significance also lies in its relationship to the vision of its builder, Manuel Hornibrook, to develop the potential of the city of Redcliffe. = Q150 icon = In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Hornibrook Bridge was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \\"structure and engineering feat\\".

It was built by order of Tsar Nicholas I after the suppression of the 1830 November Uprising in order to bolster imperial Russian control of the city. It served as a prison into the late 1930s, especially the dreaded Tenth Pavilion of the Warsaw Citadel (X Pawilon Cytadeli Warszawskiej); the latter has been a museum since 1963.  History  Romuald Traugutt's cell in the Tenth Pavilion The Citadel was built by personal order of Tsar Nicholas I after the 1830 November Uprising. Its chief architect, Major General Johan Jakob von Daehn (Ivan Dehn), used the plan of the Antwerp Citadel as the basis for his own plan (the same that was demolished by the French later that year). The cornerstone was laid by Field Marshal Ivan Paskevich, de facto viceroy of Congress Poland. The fortress is a pentagon-shaped brick structure with high outer walls, enclosing an area of 36 hectares. Its construction required the demolition of 76 residential buildings and the forcible resettlement of 15,000 inhabitants. Crosses near execution site Work on it commenced May 31, 1832, on the site of a demolished monastery and of the estate of Fawory. Officially it ended May 4, 1834, to mark the 18th birthday of Russian Crown Prince Alexander, for whom it was named. In reality, however, the fortress was not completed until 1874. The cost of construction came to 11 million rubles (roughly 8.5 tonnes of pure gold or 128 million euro at today's' prices), a colossal sum by 19th-century standards, and was borne entirely by the city of Warsaw and the Bank of Poland, as yet another punishment for the failed uprising. Walls and Russian artillery (view from inside) In peacetime, some 5,000 Russian troops were stationed there. During the 1863 January Uprising, the garrison was reinforced to over 16,000. By 1863 the fortress housed 555 artillery pieces of various calibers, and could cover most of the city center with artillery fire. About the fortress, 104 prison casemates were built, providing cells for 2,940, mostly political, prisoners. Most notably, is included the Tenth Pavilion. The list of Poles imprisoned and/or executed there up through World War I includes many notable patriots and revolutionaries: Apollo Korzeniowski, writer, political activist and father of Joseph Conrad; Romuald Traugutt, leader of the 1863 January Uprising; Jaros≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski, later military chief of the 1871 Paris Commune; Feliks Dzier≈ºy≈Ñski, a leader of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and founder of the Cheka secret police; the Marxist theoretician and revolutionary, Rosa Luxemburg; the future Marshal of Poland, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski; Pi≈Çsudski's political archrival, Roman Dmowski; and Eligiusz Niewiadomski, assassin of Poland's first president, Gabriel Narutowicz. The Citadel's Tenth Pavilion has, since 1963, served as a museum. Well before the turn of the 20th century, it was apparent that such traditional fortifications had been made obsolete by modern rifled artillery. The Tsarist authorities had planned in 1913 to raze the fortress, but the process had not begun before the outbreak of World War I. In 1915 Warsaw was occupied by German forces with little opposition from the Russian garrison, which abandoned the fortress and withdrew east. The Germans blew up several of its structures, but the main part of the Citadel remained intact and German forces performed a mass execution of 42 people in 1916.Sovereignty and the Search for Order in German-occupied Poland, 1915--1918 Jesse Curtis Kauffman, Stanford University page 68, 2008 After Poland regained her independence in 1918, the Citadel was taken over by the Polish Army. It was used as a garrison, infantry training center, and depot for materiel. During the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, Citadel's German garrison prevented linking between the city center and the northern ≈ªoliborz district. The fortress survived the war and in 1945 became again Polish Army property. See also * Warsaw Fortress * Festung Warschau References *\\"Cytadela warszawska,\\" Encyklopedia Polski, p. 109\\\\.
