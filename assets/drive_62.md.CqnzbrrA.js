The film was a moderate success at the box-office. Khamoshi was shot in Calcutta and was based on the Bengali short story titled Nurse Mitra by noted Bengali writer, Ashutosh Mukherjee and is a remake of director Asit Sen's own Bengali film, Deep Jwele Jaai (1959), starring Suchitra Sen.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/remakes- of-bengali-films-whats-new-in-this-trend/articleshow/72241437.cms The Bengali original proved to be a hit at the box office, especially at the urban centres. Impressed by the story line, producer Vuppunuthula Purushotham Reddy and director G. Ramineedu remade the Bengali film into Chivaraku Migiledi (1960), which was a blockbuster. Background Director Asit Sen (not to be confused with the actor-comedian Asit Sen) acted in the original Bengali film Deep Jwele Jaai (1959) in a role which was essayed by Dharmendra in Khamoshi, where the movie-goers could not recognise Asit Sen, because it was a dark scene marked with the baritone voice of Hemant Kumar. Later, he revealed himself in an interview in the 1990s.Khamoshi 1969 The Hindu, 16 August 2008. After his success in the off-beat films Mamta (1966) and Anokhi Raat (1968), Sen, wanting to make it big in Bombay as well, decided to remake his Bengali hit. The lead actress of the film, Waheeda Rehman suggested the name of actor Rajesh Khanna to Sen, having been impressed by his work in Aakhri Khat (1966). She said that her own performance came \\"nowhere near that of Suchitra Sen in the original.\\" She credited the director for helping her a lot during difficult scenes. Rehman said in an interview that she could not meet the standards set by Savitri in Chivaraku Migiledi (1960) for the character. Plot Colonel Sahab (Nazir Hussain), a world war II veteran doctor, is head of psychiatry ward. Nurse Radha (Waheeda Rehman) in the same ward is heart- broken after a civilian patient, Dev Kumar (Dharmendra), whom she cured by pouring out her love and affection, left the hospital. She had been unable to keep her heart separate from her professional work and had fallen in love with that patient. Now Arun Choudhary (Rajesh Khanna), a writer and poet enters as a patient, suffering from acute mania after being rejected by his lover, Sulekha, a singer. After refusing to take care of him initially, Radha later relents. While caring for Arun, she reminisces about her past and tells a story of how she took care of injured brave army soldiers when she was posted in Ladakh during the Sino-Indian war of 1962. Gradually, Arun is cured but Nurse Radha, yet again is emotionally involved with her patient. Unable to deal with her complex feelings, Radha becomes emotionally deranged. Ironically she is admitted to the same room of the ward. Colonel Sahab regrets that while he always saw a devoted nurse in her and omitted to see the woman inside her.

Variations Variations of the surname Kwong are also common. These include different spellings of the English term, and versions from other countries and cultures. In the overseas communities, those with the spelling Kwong trace their origins to families who have emigrated overseas before the 1970s when Mainland China reformed its romanization system, adjusting the surname spelling to Ku√†ng. Hong Kong residents continue to use the spelling Kwong along with most overseas Chinese communities, especially those that emigrated before the 1970s. Alternatively, since the majority of Kwongs trace their origins to and Panyu, both coastal counties in province, many Kwongs pronounce the name Fong, in accordance with the pronunciation of the local dialect. In addition, at the beginning of the 20th century, when many new Chinese immigrants were entering the U.S., those filling out ships' manifests sometimes spelled it in a variety of ways, including Ku√†ng, Kuang, Kong, Kwang, Kuong, Kwong, and Fong. In Australia, the surname can be spelled as Quong. In Peru the surname can be spelled Fhon or Fong. In Trujillo, Peru the surname Fhon comes from Panyu. The surname of a man named ÈÑ∫ÂÖ∂Ëéä who emigrated to Peru in the early 1900s was translated by a Chinese consulate member in Lima, Peru to Aurelio Kin Chong Fhon at his arrival from China, with Aurelio probably picked by the man. His mother's maiden name was Hauyon (Ou-yang Ê≠êÈôΩ) also from Panyu, Kwangtung province. The surname Fhon started in Trujillo, Peru and nowadays they can be found in many regions of the American Continent including the United States of America.  Family motto  The Kuang clan ancestral ritual motto () is \\"One origin evolved into three ancestries\\" () This motto reflects the unique familial history of the Kuangs, as the Kuang, the Lei, and the Fang families all evolved from a common ancestor. The Kuang clan ancestral seven-character motto () is \\"the official dies in Haixue Hall; the warrior dies in defense of the fort\\" ( The motto commemorates two of the greatest Ming dynasty officials in the family. The first line records Kuang Lu (ÈÇùÈú≤)'s suicide in Haixue Hall in the face of invading Manchurian rebels, and memorializes his loyalty to the country and the emperor. And the second line tells Kuang Ye (ÈÇùÂüú)'s death in the defense of a southern Ming city against Mongol invasion, and reminds people of the exemplar's loyalty and valor. Dispersion Dispersion of the Kwong last name in the United States since 1880, source: US Census Bureau =Early dispersion in Guangdong Province= According to the Chinese classical text Sheng Yuan (ÂßìËãë), \\"Many in Guangdong's Nanhai County bears the Kuang surname.\\" The fourth son of Yiping, Kuang Zhun (ÈÇùË∞Ü) had three sons. Ordered by their father to disperse and spread the family name, the second son of Kuang Zhun, Kuang Yisheng (ÈÇù‰∏ÄÂ£∞) migrated to Kukang in Xinhui County, Guangdong where he became the ancestor of the Xinhui, Kaiping, and Taishan lineage of the Kuang family. Zhun's third son, Kuang Yijun (‰∏Ä‰øä), returned to the original home of the Kuang family in Guangdong, located in Dazhen, Nanhai County, Guangdong. =Dispersion in Taishan County, Guangdong= During the reign of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty, Kuang Xing (ÈÇùÂÖ¥, style name Gongbiao ÂÖ¨Ë°®), the fourth generation ancestor of the Kuang clan in Guangdong, migrated from Pan Village, Kaiping County to Chongyun Village, Zhongxin Village, Xinning County, now known as Zhongxin Village, Chongyun Administrative District, Sanba Village, Taishan Municipality, and became the ancestor of the Kuang clan in Taishan, the largest today in Mainland China. Since the founding of Huixing's Taishan-based ancestral branch, over 30 generations of Kuangs have taken root in Chongyun Village, with a total of 13,835 individuals dispersed in 12 towns and 154 villages sharing the surname in Taishan alone according to municipal statistics. =Dispersion overseas= Originally originated from Mainland China, there are over 5 million Kuangs today (including variations), dispersed mostly in China and in the ethnic Chinese communities in Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Philippines, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Fiji, Thailand, Cuba, Burma, Indonesia. In the United States, 0.001% of the population has the last name \\"Kwong.\\" Notable individuals Kuang Zhun (ÈÑ∫Ë´Ñ), Kuang Yiping's fourth son, won the imperial examinations in AD 1142. In 1146, he received his commission and in 1152, is appointed the administrative governor of Anching in Lin'an (Ëá®ÂÆâ‰∫¨Âüé), a Song Dynasty capital. In 1168, he was named the Advisor to the Crown Prince (); the imperial inspector of the emperor's dining (); and the rank of nobility and peerage and remained the governor of Lin'an for 60 years. Zhun's wives, He and Feng, were named noble women (‰∏ÄÂìÅÂ§´‰∫∫) at the same time. In AD 1217, the Mongol army invaded the Song and Kuang Zhun ventured north to Yunjing to lead the defense against the Mongols. In AD 1218, Zhun resigned from the court and moves his entire clan back to Heyuan County, Huizhou, Guangdong. He died in AD 1219 of exhaustion. His eldest son, Kuang Yiyuan (ÈÑ∫‰∏ÄÂÖÉ), remained in Huizhou to guard Zhun's grave until his death. Kuang Yisheng (ÈÑ∫‰∏ÄËÅ≤), was the third-generation ancestor of the Guangdong clan of the Kuang surname and the third son of Kuang Zhun.

In 1634, seventh year of the Chongzhen Emperor's reign (Â¥áÁ¶é‰∏ÉÂπ¥), he offended the magistrate of Hainan County and was exiled to Guangxi province where he became the scribe for five clans, the Cen, Lan, Hu, Hou, and P'an (Â≤ë„ÄÅËóç„ÄÅËÉ°„ÄÅ‰æØ„ÄÅÊßÉ). He later became employed by Yunshan (Èõ≤ÈÑ≤Â®ò), a female warrior of the Yao tribe (Áë§Êóè), an ethnic Chinese tribe, and became familiar with the cultural anthropology, geography, and agriculture of the Yao peoples. He later authored Chiya (Ëµ§ÈõÖ), now considered an authoritative book of the ethnic minority cultures and geography of the Guangxi region. He was later employed by King Tang in the Southern Ming period (ÂçóÊòéÂîêÁéã) where he was sent as an emissary to Guangzhou by the Yongli Emperor.

Kuang Ye (ÈÑ∫Âüú, style name \\"Mengzhi\\" Â≠üË≥™), of Yizhang County, Hunan, was a Ming dynasty literati, winning the imperial examination in the reign of the Yongle Emperor and was appointed a position in the Imperial Defense department (ÂÖµÈÉ®Âè≥‰æçÈÉé). Ye's father, Kuang Zifu (ÈÑ∫Â≠êËºî), was an Anfu county magistrate (ÂÆâÁ¶èÁ∏£‰ª§) and later the chief educational minister of Ch√ºjung County (Âè•ÂÆπÁ∏£ÊïôË´≠). According to the biography of Kuang Ye in the History of Ming, Zifu was known as a remarkable educator and parent, shaping Mengzhi to become a studious, righteous, incorrupt, serious person exhibiting the utmost filial-piety towards his parents. When he was appointed the magistrate of Shan-tso county, Ye became overcome with solitude from his parents, and decided to employ his father as the county examinations official. When Zifu was notified of this, he became angry, telling his son that as a magistrate, he should not appoint an elder as an employee, due to improper observation of filial piety, remarking that \\"A son cannot control or complain about a father's work.\\" On another occasion, Mengzhi sent some robes made of a rough cloth to Zifu, and Zifu repudiated Ye, telling him that, \\"Why then do you insult me by sending me such clothes?\\" When Ye learned of his father's reaction he broke into tears, accepting his father's scolding.

A true Horatio Alger legend, Fong was born into an impoverished family in Kalihi, Hawai'i on 1 Oct 1907, as Yau Leong Fong. As a youth, Fong attended public schools, and held a variety of jobs to support his family, by selling beans and newspapers, shining shoes, and caddying golf for a quarter for nine holes. He later attended the University of Hawai'i, where he was the editor for the Ka Leo and Ka Palapala, the yearbook, and was a ROTC cadet, which paid 30 cents a day, \\"that paid for my lunch\\", recounted Fong. In 1930, Fong graduated with honors from UH in three years and attended Harvard Law School in 1932, later working as a deputy city attorney in Honolulu from 1935 to 1938. In 1938, Fong won election to the Territorial House of Representatives at the age of 31 and was chosen the House Speaker. His service in the Territorial House halted with the start of World War II in 1942 however, when he was called into action, serving as the judge advocate with the 7th Fighter Command of the Seventh Air Force, earning the rank of major and later retiring as a colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve. After his World War II service, Fong returned to his Territorial Legislature seat, finishing his term as the Vice President of the Territorial Constitutional Convention in 1950. In 1959, after a successful build-up of one of Hawai'i largest insurance financial empires, he ran for one of the two new US Senate seats for the state, becoming the only Republican to ever represent Hawai'i in the Senate, and the only Asian American to serve in the United States. Fong held the seat until 2 Jan 1977, when he retired from politics as the ranking Republican on six committees from agriculture to retirement.

It is located at Bodowyr Farm, east of Llangaffo, off the B4419 road. Burial chamber Writing in the Mona Antiqua Restaurata in the early eighteenth century, the antiquarian Henry Rowland described this as \\"a pretty cromlech standing at the top of a hillock at Bodowyr\\". He also mentioned a \\"small cirque\\" nearby and the remnants of a cairn from which the stones had mostly been removed for use as building stone; no trace remains of these structures. In 1833 the capstone was said to be supported by four upright stones so one of these would appear to have fallen since then. Bodowyr Burial Chamber is the central burial chamber of a passage grave of a type more frequently found in Ireland. The chamber has three upright stones about a metre high supporting a robust, wedge-shaped capstone. A large stone lying flat nearby on the western side may have been part of the structure, perhaps another upright, or a blocking stone, and another low stone beside the entrance to the east which was perhaps a kerb or sill. Originally a mound of earth or rubble would have covered or partially covered the dolmen, and there would have been a passage from the entrance on the southeast to the side of the mound. The mound has since been completely dispersed. The location is on level, low-lying ground and it is not apparent why this particular site should have been chosen. The fact that Snowdon and the Glyderau are visible in the distance, with the Llanberis Pass between them, may be significant, and there may be some solar or lunar alignment as seen from the entrance that has not yet been elucidated. Access Bodowyr Burial Chamber is under the care of the Welsh Heritage organisation Cadw. It is open throughout the year, apart from 24, 25 and 26 December and 1 January, between the hours of 10am and 4pm. It can be accessed by walking across a sometimes muddy field. There is no entry charge.

He is often credited with having trained large numbers of provincial and Springbok players, and was an iconic figure of schoolboy rugby in Pietermaritzburg, and indeed, South Africa. History James Mervyn Nicholson (the \\"Skonk\\" nickname came later) was born in Underberg, Natal, on 6 February 1917, and grew up on the family farm in that district. In due course, he was sent to the Durban Preparatory High School (DPHS) in Durban, from whence he proceeded to the Durban High School (DHS). His father was a great friend of the legendary DHS Head Master, Mr AS \\"Madevu\\" Langley, and so young Mervyn (as he was then called) was sent to DHS, rather than to Maritzburg College, which was also a family school, but the fierce-yet-friendly rival institution of the Durban school. He enjoyed a remarkably successful stint at DHS, and matriculated in 1935 as Head Prefect, captain of both the First XV and the First XI, captain of the Natal Schools' XV, and Senior Cadet Officer. It was as a young standard six (grade 8) boarder at DHS that he earned his famous nickname of \\"Skonk\\": the then Head Prefect, M Bennett, recognised young Nicholson's spirited nature, referring to him as \\"Skonkwaan\\", which was the name of an ox on the family farm, meaning (in isiZulu) \\"tent-peg\\". This was later shortened to \\"Skonk\\". Having completed his studies at the erstwhile Natal University College (NUC) in Pietermaritzburg (now the University of KwaZulu-Natal), Nicholson started out his academic teaching career at his alma mater, DHS, immediately before the Second World War broke out. During the war, he served as an instructor (sergeant-major), before being demobilised out of the SA Army in 1944 due to injury. Much to the disappointment of the redoubtable Head Master of DHS, Col AC \\"Betsy\\" Martin MC, Nicholson was sent by the Natal Education authorities to Maritzburg College (which is known simply as \\"College\\"), where he taught Geography and coached the 1st XV rugby team from 1948 to 1982. Indeed, in 1944 the youthful Nicholson found himself the subject of a heated dispute between Col Martin and the equally pugnacious Headmaster of College, Mr JW \\"John-Willie\\" Hudson, who also wanted to enjoy the services of the talented young master. Mr Hudson ultimately prevailed, as was his wont. Up until his death, Nicholson still served Maritzburg College and could each day be seen making his way slowly to the school in one of his two 1960s Ford Valiants, invariably with his daughter, Diana, alongside him in the front seat. Under his leadership, Maritzburg College came to be one of the sporting powerhouses of South Africa, producing 14 unbeaten First XVs and countless Natal and SA Schools' players during his 35 seasons at the helm. Coaching Nicholson coached numerous players, many of whom have played or are playing in international or national rugby sides. The names of these players include Keith Oxlee, Brian Irvine (captain of the Junior Springboks), Ormond Taylor and Andy van der Watt, and, since his official retirement, Joel Stransky (of World Cup 1995 fame), Jeremy Thomson, Pieter Dixon and Butch James. This exposure to internationally acclaimed rugby stars rendered Skonk one of the most recognised faces in South African rugby. Nearby to the Kent Pavilion at Maritzburg College, overlooking the school's main rugby field, Goldstone's, stands the \\"Nicholson Arch\\", which was erected in 1982, the year of Nicholson's retirement. It is a cherished tradition for each First XV player, as he steams onto the famous pitch, to reach up and touch the apex of the arch, in mute tribute to Maritzburg College's own \\"Mr Rugby\\". Nicholson co-authored a book with Tony Wiblin, detailing the complex and often turbulent history of Maritzburg College and its rugby, entitled Jimeloyo-Ji (which is the College war-cry). Later life and death In the company of many of his friends, Nicholson celebrated his 90th birthday on 6 February 2007. Nicholson's guests of honour included Ian McIntosh (the former coach of the Sharks & Springboks) and Josie Nel, the 99-year-old widow of Philip Nel, captain of the 1937 Springboks. On 6 February 2011, Nicholson celebrated his 94th birthday with his family. He died on 27 February, after a short period of illness.

The pier, which opened in 1933, ceased operations in 2006. In 2008 the site was converted into a restaurant, One On The Bund, with Chinese cuisine. This restaurant closed in 2014 and was replaced by another restaurant, The Clifford Pier, which offers a selection of local, Asian, and Western dishes under the operations of the Fullerton Bay Hotel.https://www.fullertonhotels.com/the-fullerton-bay- hotel/the-clifford-pier.html History Before the Tanjong Pagar wharves were built in the 1850s, Johnston's Pier was the chief landing place. By the 1930s, the pier was worn out and Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir Cecil Clementi decided to build a new pier. =Launch= Clifford Pier was built between 1927 and 1933, and was named after Sir Hugh Clifford, the former Governor of the Straits Settlements between 1927 and 1929. Its opening on 3 June 1933 was boycotted by merchants as they wanted the old name, Johnston's Pier, reinstated. The Scottish Alexander Laurie Johnston was one of the earliest distinguished European residents who was in Singapore at about the same time as Sir Stamford Raffles. A friend of the latter, Johnston was one of Singapore's first businessmen and the founder of the Chamber of Commerce. He was a popular and well-respected citizen whose business was directly connected in those days with imports and exports to and from Europe, ships' victualling and supplies. This meant that ships' captains called frequently on Johnston, who was well known for his kindness, wisdom and hospitality. Johnston established his company on the site of Whiteaway's Building (now Malayan Bank Building) and in 1848 moved to the present Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank site. In order to facilitate the transportation of import and export goods from boats, a pier was built by the company and named after Johnston. Like its predecessor Johnston's Pier, the Hoklos (Hokkien) also called it ang theng beh thow(Chinese: Á∫¢ÁÅØÁ†ÅÂ§¥), meaning \\"red lamp harbour\\", referring to a red oil lamp beacon which shone over the pier at night as a warning to ships. Sir Hugh Clifford, on the other hand, although a highly regarded man, had no connection with the port of Singapore or its amenities other than the fact that he was the governor. His activities were largely occupied with his visits to the Malay States and in particular Pahang, the scene of much of his earlier service. Clifford Pier was a landing point for immigrants and other sea passengers. The pier was later used as a terminal for tourists and day trippers who boarded small boats and ferries heading for the Southern Islands. During the annual pilgrimage season to Kusu Island, regular ferries departed from Clifford Pier to the island. Clifford Pier ceased operations on 1 April 2006, and was replaced by the Marina South Pier. =Architecture= Clifford Pier, Singapore Clifford Pier's roof structure Clifford Pier was designed by the Public Works Department, where Frank Dorrington Ward was then the Chief Architect in the 1930s. The pier has a simple but unique architecture with a roof structure comprising concrete arched trusses in a riband form. Details, such as brackets and even the fire hose cabinets, were evidently designed with much consideration. Marina South Pier With the construction of the Marina Barrage, a dam across the Marina Channel which will convert the existing Marina Bay into a reservoir, the existing Clifford Pier has ceased operations on 1 April 2006. The Marina South Pier has been constructed at Marina South and was opened in April 2006 to replace the existing Clifford Pier. The existing 26,000 square metre Clifford Pier site including its adjacent former Customs Harbour Branch building has been safeguarded for conservation, and its surrounding land parcels are currently being developed into a retail, leisure, entertainment and hotel centre.

Note the control room and liquid oxygen storage underneath the rocket. The Rocket U-boat was an abandoned military project to create the first ballistic missile submarine. It was conceived by Nazi Germany during the Second World War. Plans for the rocket U-boat involved an attack on New York City with newly invented V-2 rockets. History During World War II, several projects were undertaken at Peenemunde to mount rockets on a U-boat. In 1941 first trials were held, using a Nebelwerfer rocket launcher, mounted on the deck of . Tests were carried out, with successful firings from the surface, and from up to 12 metres underwater without any effect on the missiles' accuracy. The arrangement was envisaged as a weapon against convoy escorts, but with no guidance system the arrangement was largely ineffective. In 1943 interest in the concept was revived with the advent of the V-1 flying bomb; proposals were made to mount a V-1 and launcher on a U-boat in order to strike targets at a much greater range than the 150 mile (251 km) radius from land-based sites. This proposal foundered on inter-service rivalry, however, as the V-1 was an Air Force (Luftwaffe) project. In 1943 also, consideration was given to firing the V-2 rocket from a U-boat, with particular thought to hitting targets in the United States. As the V-2 was too large to be mounted on any U-boat then in service, a 500-ton submersible vessel for transport and launching was designed. Un-manned and unpowered, this was intended to be towed by a conventional U-boat to within range of its target, then set up and launched. Three of these vessels were ordered in late 1944, but only one was built, and no trials of the practicality of the system were carried out. However, Allied intelligence came to know of these projects, and the US Navy developed a counter-measure, known as Operation Teardrop. This operation was carried out in early 1945 when a group of U-boats were detected heading for the US east coast. Most of these submarines were quickly pounced on in Mid-Atlantic and destroyed in the massive anti-submarine operation, though post‚Äìwar analysis showed no credible missile threat had existed.

It is approximately from Thaxted, farther from the larger towns of Saffron Walden and Braintree. Nearby villages include Great Bardfield, Great Sampford, and Wethersfield. History There has been a settlement in Finchingfield since historical records of the area began. Also, there is archaeological evidence for a Roman villa 400 metres south- southwest of the village church. The place-name 'Finchingfield ' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as Fincingefelda, a name that means 'the field of Finc or his people'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.179 The village was an official stop for horse-drawn coaches travelling from London to Norwich. Spains Hall, the nearby Elizabethan country house, was built in the early fifteenth century. The hall is named after Hervey de Ispania, who held the manor at the time of the 1086 Domesday Book. Since then, the land has been owned by four families: the de Ispania family, the Kempe family, who acquired it when Margery de Ispania married Nicholas Kempe in the early fifteenth century, the Ruggles family (later the Ruggles-Brise family), and currently celebrity chef Jamie Oliver with wife Jools and their 5 children. The hall was the hub of the community, those families owning much of the village, and employing most of the villagers. (Registration required) Community Finchingfield and Cornish Hall End combined had a population of 1,471 at the United Kingdom Census 2011.\\"Finchingfield & Cornish Hall End\\", Braintree District Council.

Societies and clubs founded in Finchingfield, include The Finchingfield Society, the Horticultural Society, the Royal British Legion, and Finchingfield Cricket Club. It often is called the most beautiful village in England, a \\"picture-postcard\\" village and one of the most photographed, with a duck pond and village green surrounded by Georgian and medieval cottages; St John the Baptist Church on the hill; an eighteenth-century windmill; three public houses; Post Office; tea rooms; a hall; a primary school; and a doctor's surgery. It often has appeared in television programmes, films, and commercials, as well as on chocolate boxes, biscuit tins, and other products. Finchingfield was the home and is the burial place of Dodie Smith, whose books include The Hundred and One Dalmatians (1956). She lived in The Barretts at Howe Street, a hamlet in the parish about from the village. The 2013 Sky series Chickens was filmed in the village. The series concerns three young men who avoided going to fight during the First World War, written by and starring Simon Bird and Joe Thomas.

It is owned by Tower Broadcasting and airs an adult standards radio format, which also includes some soft oldies. The music is programmed in-house and ranges from Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin to The Beatles and Dionne Warwick. Weekends include the syndicated \\"Sundays with Sinatra,\\" hosted by Sid Mark, and polka music hosted by Jimmy Sturr. Most hours begin with world and national news from CBS Radio News. The studios, offices and transmitter are on Lake Street in Elmira.Radio-Locator.com/WEHH Programming is also heard on an FM translator station, 93.9 MHz W230BB in Elmira. History =Early Years= WEHH signed on the air on July 4, 1956.Broadcasting Yearbook 1957 page 182 It was the third AM radio station in Chemung County and the fifth in the Elmira-Corning market in New York state. Testing on the frequency may have begun as early as 1952, according to documents at the original transmitter site found by former station engineer Jim Appleton. It originally broadcast at 500 watts, with a non-directional pattern, only on the air during daylight hours. The studios were over Oldroyd's Grocery Store on Hanover Square in Horseheads. Later, a new studio facility was constructed on Latta Brook Road east of Route 17 in the town of Horseheads. When an overpass was built on Latta Brook Road at Route 17, the new studio was in the construction area and demolished. Another facility was built just east of the Route 17 overpass (Latta Brook Road has no interchange with the highway). For years, the studio location was identified on-air as Latta Brook Park and during weather reports the forecast was always ended with \\"the current temperature is ... in beautiful Latta Brook Park.\\" The single tower non-directional antenna was fed by a Collins 550A transmitter in a field across the highway from the station. It stood until a storm in the early 2000s blew it down across Latta Brook Road, according to Appleton. =Top 40 and Oldies Years= The station, founded by Frank P. Saia, was owned by the Elmira Heights-Horseheads Broadcasting Company (family owned) for many years and was the first rock'n'roll station in the market. In the late 1950s and throughout the 1960s area teenagers listened to RadioActive WEHH, Superhit Radio WEHH, and finally Rainbow Radio WEHH. Ed \\"Knucklehead\\" Knowles was the station's leading personality in the late 50s and early 60s. He did many Record Hops in the area with his engineer Rod Denson. Other DJs during that time were, Bob Welch, and Lou Coughlin. In the 1950s and 1960s, students rushed to the nearest drugstore for their free copy of the WEHH Fabulous 50, which detailed the 50 top hit songs of the day. A stack of the Fabulous 50s was found in the basement of the Latta Brook Road studio when the station moved out in the early 2000s. By the early 1970s, the format had changed to easy listening with Frank at the helm. In the 1980s, Ray Ross bought the station and switched the format to oldies. The station also broadcast Elmira Pioneers' minor league and local Little League baseball games, as well as high school football and Elmira College hockey games. Under Ross' ownership, the station's broadcast day expanded to midnight, then to 24 hours a day, but at very low power after sunset. Among personalities on-air during this time were Norm Stull, Chris Sando, Scott Iddings, Jane MacNett, James Wilson, Pam Kauffman, Russ Ross, Ray Smith, Mike Owens, as well as owner Ray Ross. Nationally syndicated programs hosted by Cousin' Brucie and Kasey Kasem were also highlighted on WEHH during the 80's. Seeking to fill a niche in the market in the early 1990s, Ross switched the format to adult standards. By the end of the decade, the station was being operated at the WELM and WLVY studios by the Pembrook Pines Media Group under a local marketing agreement. =Adding an FM signal= WEHH was a standalone AM station for much of its existence until Frank Saia decided to put an FM station on the air in the mid-1960s. Frank Saia believed in the future of FM broadcasting and was responsible for WEHH-FM which signed on at 94.3 MHz in 1964, with Elmira as its city of license. Studios were co-located with WEHH-AM in Latta Brook Park. The transmitter was located at a private site on East Hill in Elmira. The station broadcast mainly easy listening and classical music along with a bit of country music in the mornings, \\"The Ralph Emery Show.\\" In the 70's WEHH-FM broadcast Elmira City Council meetings live with Tony Volino handling the remote duties from the Council Chambers. Frank Saia, before the founding of WENY-TV, also had the first crack at UHF TV channel 36 and at one time considered putting a WEHH-TV on channel 36. But those plans did not materialize. The FM station later was sold to crosstown rival WELM and changed to the current call sign, WLVY. In 1990, Ross also was instrumental in getting a new station on-the-air on 96.9 MHz. That station‚Äîthen known as WMKB‚Äîwas never owned by Ross, but later was signed on as contemporary Christian station WREQ. For a brief time, WMKB-FM simulcast the WEHH-AM signal. Ross formally sold WEHH to Pembrook Pines in 1999, after which it went dark for several months. =Adding a Translator= It returned to the air in 2000 24/7 with reduced nighttime power, directional at 1600 kHz, using a satellite-delivered adult standards format. The station now uses three towers off Lake Street in Elmira. A translator station was added to simulcast the programming on FM. From September 2013 until some time in spring 2014, WEHH simulcast on WGGO and WOEN, two sister stations in Cattaraugus County, as Sound Communications prepared to buy the Pembrook Pines station cluster. Antitrust concerns were raised about the sale. (Sound already owned a large number of stations in Elmira.) As a result, WEHH was spun off to a different owner, forcing the end of the trimulcast. Tower Broadcasting is the current owner of WEHH. The company is led by Gordon Ichikawa, who, as his company name implies, specializes mainly in ownership of broadcast towers. WEHH is one of a handful of broadcast stations in the U.S. to carry a dual city of license. The station is licensed to both Elmira Heights and Horseheads.

The English were ambushed and routed while marching through a pass in the Curlew Mountains, near the town of Boyle, in the west of Ireland. The English forces suffered heavy casualties. Losses by allied Irish forces were not recorded but were probably minimal. Campaign In April 1599, The 2nd Earl of Essex landed in Ireland with over 17,000 troops and cavalry to put down the rebellion of Hugh O'Neill, and Red Hugh O'Donnell, which had spread from Ulster to all of Ireland. To this end, he supported one of O'Donnell's Irish enemies, Sir Donogh O'Connor (O'Connor Sligo), encouraging him to retake his territories in Sligo that O'Donnell had occupied. Sligo Town was an excellent advance base, with Ballyshannon 20 miles to the north-east commanding an important river-ford at the principal western passage into O'Donnell's country in Ulster. English military advisers had long urged the government councils in Dublin and London to capture these strategic points. O'Connor's brother-in-law, Tibbot na Long Burke (son of Gr√°inne O'Malley), was appointed joint-commander with an English captain of a force sailing from Galway, and O'Connor was expected to receive them in Sligo. However, O'Donnell quickly besieged O'Connor at Collooney Castle with over 2,000 men in an effort to starve him out, and Lord Essex was put on the back foot. Essex had no option but to support the besieged O'Connor, one of the few Gaelic chieftains the Crown could rely upon for support. He ordered the experienced Sir Conyers Clifford, who was based in Athlone, to relieve the castle with 1,500 English infantry and 200 cavalry. It was hoped that the operation would also distract the chief rebel, Tyrone, and afford the Crown an opportunity to march into his Ulster territory across its south-eastern border. O'Donnell left 300 men at Collooney Castle under his cousin, Niall Garbh O'Donnell, and sent another 600 to Sligo Town to prevent the landing of English reinforcements under Tibbot na Long. He then marched to Dunavaragh with 1,500 of his men, where he was joined by the additional forces of Brian √ìg, King of West Breifne, who had 400 soldiers stationed at the pass, as well as those of Conor MacDermott. The Irish then carefully prepared an ambush site in the Curlew Mountains, along the English line of march. O'Donnell had trees felled and placed along the road to impede their progress. When he got word of the English passing through Boyle, O'Donnell positioned his men. Musketeers, archers and javelin men were placed in the woods alongside the road to harass the English soldiers. The main body of Irish infantry, armed with pikes and axes, were placed out of sight behind the ridge of the mountain. The battle In hot harvest weather, Clifford's force marched from Athlone through Roscommon, Tulsk, and Boyle. At 4pm on 15 August, they reached the foot of the Curlew Mountains (highest point 860 feet), which had to be crossed before Sligo could be approached. The expedition was poorly supplied, and Clifford's men were tired and hungry, and probably in no fit state to continue. But Clifford had received false intelligence that the pass was undefended, and he therefore chose to seize the opportunity and march across, promising his troops plenty of beef in the evening. This meant that his men missed out on the rest that had been planned for them in Boyle, whereas the Irish were well-fed and prepared. The English came under gunfire, arrow and javelin attack as soon as they reached the first of O'Donnell's barricades, between Boyle and Ballinafad. The barricade was lightly defended by just a handful of Irish troops who quickly abandoned it and rode on horseback to their army's camp to inform Red Hugh O'Donnell of the advancing English forces. Immediately following the news of the advancing English force, Conor MacDermott and his 600 troops moved swiftly into the mountains and took up concealed positions on either side of the bog road near the Bohar-Buidhe Woods. The English moved past and proceeded up the hill where they sustained further casualties as O'Donnell's skirmishers engaged in hit- and-run attacks on the English formation. The road consisted of \\"stones of six or seven foot broad, lying above ground, with plashes of bog between them\\", and was lined with woodland on one side. The further the English advanced, the more intensive the rebels' fire became, and some English soldiers began to lose their nerve and slip away. Eventually, there was a firefight, lasting about 90 minutes. Initially the English forces advanced and despite heavy return fire, some of the Irish forces believed they should retreat as they had not expected to engage the English vanguard in open battle. However, MacDermott noticing the heavy casualties the initial fusillades had caused in the English ranks, ordered his pipers to continue sounding battle songs and believed he could destroy Clifford's entire force. At this point, the English forces began to waver and their advance was halted as the Irish muskets and archers continued to pour fire into their ranks. The English musketeers ‚Äì running low on gunpowder and ammunition ‚Äì retreated, leaving their remaining infantry under intense Irish fire. At this point Radcliffe had been wounded by a gunshot to the face and another to the leg. He ordered Henry Cosby, the Anglo-Irish son of Francis Cosby, to lead an attack but it soon became clear Cosby had no desire to. While being supported in the arms of two of his officers, Radcliffe told Cosby: \\"I see, Cosby, that I must leave thee to thy baseness, but will tell thee ere I go that it were better to die in the hands of thy countrymen than at my return to perish by my sword\\". Colum, p.198. The half-hearted charge by Cosby turned back and began to retreat. This further demoralised the English forces as they watched their only corps which still showed some sign of holding an intact formation flee the field. At this point, Brian √ìg and his 160 heavy Gallowglasses entered the battle, causing panic amongst the English forces: \\"Like hounds slipped from the leash, O'Rourke's Brenny men went upon the Queen's vanguard... MacDermott's gunmen and archers gave way to the right hand and to the left, opening out like folding doors as the Brenny men, with a shout at such an instant changed fortitude to alarm, and alarm to panic terror, went upon the foe.\\" The commander of the vanguard, Alexander Radcliffe, could no longer control his troops. They wheeled about in a panic and collided with the main column, which broke and fled. The commander led a charge with his remaining pikemen but was shot dead in that action. With the English ranks in disarray, the main body of Irish infantry, which had concealed itself on the reverse slope of the hill, closed in and fought hand- to-hand. Clifford tried to regain control over his men, but appeared overcome by his circumstances. He managed to rally himself and was killed by a gun-shot through the chest as he rushed the enemy. Despite his death, the rearguard managed to maintain some semblance of formation and continued to fight on as others fled the field. The English were routed, but the situation was prevented from becoming a complete disaster for them when the commander of the horse, Sir Griffin Markham (with John Harington in his ranks), charged uphill - \\"amongst rocks and bogs where never horse was seen to charge before\\" - and temporarily drove the rebels back, forcing MacDermott's musketeers and archers out onto either side of the bog and into the tree-line. As Markham's forces pursued MacDermott's fighters ‚Äì and English troops fired from the roadside at the gunmen on either side of the bog, Brian √ìg led a charge of his own. Emerging from the forest with his gallowglasses he slowly and steadily advanced towards the English cavalry. The English regrouped and began a charge of their own, but on either side of the bog MacDermott's men had regrouped and were now pouring fire transversely on the English cavalry. The gallowglasses supported by the kerne charged the cavalry and routed Markham's forces, causing them to retreat back into the mountains towards the barricade. During the charge, Brian √ìg was injured in the hand and the leg. Markham, meanwhile, was shot resulting in a broken bone in his right arm.Colum, p.202 Though the actions of the English cavalry allowed many of their foot soldiers to escape, Clifford's men were pursued as far as the town of Boyle by 400 of MacDermott's musketeers and gunmen alongside the 160 gallowglasses of Brian √ìG. The fleeing English found shelter in Boyle Abbey. About half of the English forces were killed in the battle. Irish losses were light due to having been firing from prepared positions and then routing a disorganized and demoralised enemy. The site of the battle is just over 2km west of the N4 Aftermath Gaelic Chieftain overlooking Curlew Pass on National 4 road 400 years commemoration Gaelic Chieftain Plaque Brian √ìg O'Rourke, who had led the soldiers on the ground, ordered Clifford's head to be cut off and delivered to O'Donnell - who had remained nearby, but without taking part in the fight.Ireland's Wars: Curlew Pass While the head was brought to Collooney Castle to intimidate its defenders, the trunk was carried by MacDermott to the monastery of Lough Key, where he hoped to use it to ransom his own prisoners. At last, the trunk was given a decent burial in the monastery, and it was noted at the time that Clifford had lately dreamed of his own capture by O'Donnell and of being carried by monks into their convent. O'Connor Sligo surrendered the castle shortly afterwards and reluctantly joined with the rebels. After the victory, there was a noticeable increase in the rate of desertion by Irish troops from the ranks of Essex's army, and the earl ordered that the surviving troops be divided up as fit only to hold walls. https://neverfeltbetter.wordpress.com/2012/12/11/irelands-wars-the-curlew- pass/ The battle was a classic Gaelic Irish ambush, similar to the battle of Glenmalure in 1580 or the battle of the Yellow Ford in 1598. According to the Annals of the Four Masters, the victory was put down to the intercession of the Blessed Mary, rather than to arms. But Clifford had been overconfident - a trait in him that Essex once warned against - and it is clear that English military commanders were choosing to learn the hard way about the increased effectiveness of Irish rebel forces. The Queen's principal secretary, The Rt Hon. Robert Cecil, M.P., rated this defeat (and the simultaneous defeat of Harrington in Wicklow on 29 May) as the two heaviest blows ever suffered by the English in Ireland, and sought to lay the blame indirectly on Lord Essex. It left O'Donnell and the earl of Tyrone free from any threat from the Connacht side, and rendered a land-based attack through Armagh highly improbable, a factor that weighed with Essex as he marched northward later in the year and entered a truce with Lord Tyrone. In August 1602 the Curlew Pass was the scene of the last victory won by the rebels during the war, when a panicking English force was again routed and suffered significant losses; this time, the rebels were led by Rory O'Donnell (and with him, O'Connor Sligo) who commanded 400 musketeers. There is an impressionistic sculpture by Maurice Harron called \\"The Gaelic Chieftain\\", unveiled in 1999, overlooking the N4, but this is not on the site of the battle, which is roughly 2 kilometres south-west of the statue.

Early life He was born in Wethersfield, Connecticut, United States, to Capt. Francis Stillman and Harriet Stillman (n√©e Robbins). In February 1828 he went by way of New Orleans to Matamoros and established himself as an entrepreneur. He was involved in cotton brokerage and real estate in addition to silver mines in Nuevo Le√≥n and Tamaulipas. Texas and Mexico =Fort Brown= Before the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War the United States government was looking to build a permanent fort along the Rio Grande. Charles Stillman, having a deed to the land, offered to lease it to the government to build a fort on. This land was part of the Espiritu Santo land grant, but due to a complication involving the owners not listing the land with the Mexican or Texas government a land dispute ensued which reached the Supreme Court. =The founding of Brownsville= Charles Stillman founded Brownsville, Texas, on January 13, 1849, around the same time as the establishment of Fort Brown. The land, which was less than a mile from the fort, was also disputed. Stillman had bought large pieces of land north and northeast of Matamoros from the heirs of Jos√© Narciso Cavazos. Stillman offered the Cavazos family $33,000 for their land even though it was worth $214,000. The Cavazos family accepted the offer to avoid paying legal fees. However, Stillman never paid the Cavazos family the $33,000 for the land.Takaki, 1993 Since the land belonged to the heirs of his second marriage. This was one of the reasons the Cortina Wars happened. =M Kenedy and Co.= Charles Stillman started a transport company with Miflin Kenedy and Richard King after the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, under the name of King, Kenedy and Co. The transport company bought up the Government's surplus steam boats which were used to ferry U.S. forces across the Rio Grande. King, Kenedy and Co. gained a monopoly over river trade until former business partners of Stillman, King and Kenedy's Jos√© San Rom√°n and John Young started their own river boat venture. Profits were still very high for Kenedy, King and Co. despite competition. In the 1850s the Cortina Wars started, Juan Cortina, an enemy of Stillman's, led some attacks on the King, Kenedy and Co. fleet, most notably, an attack near Rio Grande City, Texas, but did not disrupt it. Shortly before the Civil War Stillman hired a clerk by the name of Francisco Yturria who would become an instrumental partner in King, Kenedy and Co. during the Civil War. Yturria being born in Matamoros could register boats under Mexico allowing them to fly the Mexican flag. Since Mexico was a neutral country American ships blockading the Texas Coast could not board Stillman's ships. Stillman, King and Kenedy arranged for bales of cotton to be sent to Brownsville where it was ferried across the Rio Grande to Matamoros. The Rio Grande could not be blockaded because it was an international border and such a blockade would have caused an incident with the Mexican Government. Despite Union Forces capturing Brownsville in 1863 and 1864, smuggling cotton was still a profitable venture. After the war a rail line from Brownsville to Point Isabel (Port Isabel, Texas was known as Point Isabel during this period) was completed and river traffic dwindled and the company sold its boats to Captain William Kelly. Personal life On August 17, 1849 in Wethersfield, Connecticut, he married Elizabeth Pamela Goodrich, also from Wethersfield. Goodrich was the daughter of Deacon Joshua Goodrich and Clarissa Goodrich (n√©e Francis). Together, they had: *James Stillman (1850‚Äì1918), who married Sarah Elizabeth Rumrill, and was the president of the First National City Bank **James Alexander Stillman (1873‚Äì1944), who married Anne Urquhart Potter. He also served as president of National City Bank of New York **Elsie Stillman, who married William Goodsell Rockefeller, the son of William Rockefeller. **Isabel Stillman, who married Percy Avery Rockefeller, another son of William Rockefeller. **Charles Chauncey Stillman **Ernest Goodrich Stillman After the war, Stillman lived in Brownsville and New York but moved to New York permanently in 1866. Charles Stillman died on December 18, 1875 and was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in New York, NY. His great-great-grandson is director Whit Stillman (b. 1952).https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/31/style/the-whit- stillman-rat-pack.html =Legacy= Charles Stillman is believed to have named the first three streets in Brownsville after himself, his wife Elizabeth and his father Francis. These Streets are named St. Charles, Elizabeth St. and St. Francis. It is believed the Sign making company who made the street signs originally misread the order and mistook Street (St.) for Saint (which is also St.). There is a middle school named after him in Brownsville, Texas.

The distraught young Queen Victoria, whose ardent political sympathies were with the Whigs, first asked the Duke of Wellington, a former Tory prime minister, to form a new government, but he politely declined. She then reluctantly invited Conservative leader Robert Peel to form a government. Peel realised that such a government would hold a minority in the House of Commons and would be structurally weak, possibly damaging his future political career. Peel accepted the invitation on the condition that Victoria dismiss some of her Ladies of the Bedchamber, many of whom were wives or relatives of leading Whig politicians. She refused the request, considering her ladies as close friends, not as objects of political bargaining. Peel, therefore, refused to become Prime Minister and Melbourne was eventually persuaded to stay on as Prime Minister. After Victoria's marriage to Prince Albert in 1840, she relied less on her ladies as companions. In the 1841 general election, Peel's Conservatives gained a majority and Victoria appointed Peel as the new Prime Minister, a change of government for which Melbourne had meanwhile been preparing her. Accepting \\"the wise advice of the democratically minded Prince Albert\\", Victoria replaced three of her Whig ladies with Conservatives. At the time of the crisis, the inexperienced Victoria was not yet twenty years old and had been on the throne less than two years. She was dismayed at the thought of losing her first, and so far only, Prime Minister, the avuncular Melbourne, a wise and kindly father-figure to her in the first years of her reign‚Äîher own father, the Duke of Kent, had died when she was an infant. Victoria also mistakenly assumed that Peel wanted to replace all of her ladies‚Äîher closest friends and companions at court‚Äîwhen in fact Peel wished to replace only six of the twenty-five ladies, but failed to make his intentions clear to Victoria. Late in life, Victoria regretted her youthful intransigence, writing to her private secretary, Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham: \\"I was very young then, and perhaps I should act differently if it was all to be done again.\\" The Bedchamber Crisis was depicted in the 2009 film The Young Victoria and in the 2016 television-drama series Victoria.

The D.I was also flown in Austro-Hungarian service as a fighter trainer aircraft under the designation B.III. Confusing the matter further, both the D.II and D.I arrived at the Front in German service at similar times, in July‚ÄìAugust 1916. The main designer was Martin Kreutzer. Design and development Fokker D.I 151-1916 Similar to the D.II, the D.I was an unstaggered single-bay, or Einstielig equal-span biplane. The upper fuselage was initially parallel with the upper wing and was fitted with the Mercedes D.I six-cylinder water-cooled engine. Control was achieved using wing-warping. The wings were also tested in twin-bay (Zweistielig) form. To improve visibility, the center section was cut back and the wings were slightly staggered and the top wing raised slightly. These improvements were retained, and the airplane was ordered into production with an Mercedes D.II inline engine and a single synchronized 7.92 mm (.312 in) lMG 08 machine gun. The Austro-Hungarian B.IIIs, serialled 04.11 to 04.27, retained the Mercedes D.I engine, and some were armed with a free-firing Schwarzlose MG M.07/12 machine gun mounted above the centre-section. Operational history Deliveries began in July 1916 and 90 D.I fighters were delivered to the German Fliegertruppen and 17 B.III fighter trainers to the Austro-Hungarian 'Luftfahrttruppen', eight of which were license-built by the Magyar √Åltal√°nos G√©pgy√°r (MAG) in Hungary. One Austro-Hungarian B III was experimentally fitted with a Mercedes D.III engine. Another had ailerons instead of wing warping, and still another had long span, swept back wings. Compared with aircraft in service at that time, such as the Albatros D.II and the Nieuport 11, this Fokker's design and performance were decidedly unimpressive, and further production did not take place.

He was abbot of Hirsau Abbey, for whom he created the Constitutiones Hirsaugienses, based on the uses of Cluny, and was the father of the Hirsau Reforms, which influenced many Benedictine monasteries in Germany. He supported the papacy in the Investiture Controversy. In the Roman Catholic Church, he is a Blessed, the second of three steps toward recognition as a saint. Early life William was born in Bavaria, possibly in about 1030; nothing more is known of his origins. As a puer oblatus entrusted to the Benedictines he received his spiritual education as a monk in St. Emmeram's Abbey, a private church of the Bishop of Regensburg, where the famous Otloh of St. Emmeram was William's teacher. It is generally believed that it was here that William first became friends with Ulrich of Zell (later distinguished as a Cluniac reformer and a saint), a friendship which lasted to the end of his life. Secular activities Also in the abbey, about the middle of the 11th century, William composed learned treatises on astronomy and music, disciplines that formed part of the quadrivium, in the knowledge of which William was considered unsurpassed in his day. He constructed various astronomical instruments, made a sun-dial which showed the variations of the heavenly bodies, the solstices, equinoxes and other sidereal phenomena.\\"Bernoldi chronicon\\" in P. L., CXLVIII, 1404 His famous stone astrolabe can still be seen today in Regensburg: more than 2.5 metres high, it is engraved on the front with an astrolabe sphere, while on the reverse side is the figure of a man gazing into the heavens, presumed to be the Greek astronomer and poet Aratos of Soloi (of the 3rd century B.C.). He was also a skilled musician and made various improvements on the flute.Aribo Scholasticus, \\"De musica\\", in P. L., CL, 1334 Abbacy In 1069 William was called to Hirsau Abbey as elected successor to the deposed Abbot Frederick. He immediately took over the management of the monastery, but refused to accept the abbatial benediction till after the death of his unjustly deposed predecessor in 1071. In his first years of office he pursued the goal of making the abbey independent of secular powers, on the basis of the reforms of Gorze Abbey in Lorraine and of Cluny, which had begun to take effect some time previously. This policy put him in direct opposition to Hirsau's powerful lay abbots, the Counts of Calw. A writ of Emperor Henry IV, probably drafted shortly after 1070, although it created the important link between the abbey and the monarchy, nevertheless largely confirmed the status of Hirsau as a private monastery of the counts. However, a privilege of Pope Gregory VII, drawn up between 1073 and 1075, put Hirsau under papal protection. William eventually prevailed against Count Adalbert II of Calw, who renounced his lay lordship over the abbey. Henry IV immediately put the monastic community under his own protection, although Hirsau was not made an imperial abbey directly answerable to the monarch (reichsunmittelbar). The count received by royal grant the Vogtei of the abbey. The abbey, by deed of 9 October 1075,the Hirsauer Formular received the \\"complete freedom of the monastery\\",integra libertas coenobii which included the freedom to elect and invest the abbot, and to elect or dismiss the Vogt, although it is true that the choice of candidates for the latter position was restricted to the kin of the founder. In 1075 William went to Rome to obtain the papal confirmation for the exemption of Hirschau. On this occasion he became acquainted with Pope Gregory VII, with whose efforts towards reforms he was in deep sympathy and whom he afterwards strongly supported in the Investiture Controversy against Henry IV. Hirsau Reforms Against this background William introduced to Hirsau, from no later than 1079, a number of reforms originating in Cluny, on which he based the Constitutiones Hirsaugienses (\\"Customs of Hirsau\\"), which later became very widespread as a result of the Hirsau Reforms (see below). These reforms particularly focussed on discipline and obedience, tough punishments for infringements of the rules and continuous supervision of the monks. Parallel with these developments he found it necessary, in order to bring under some sort of control the great numbers of laymen flocking to Hirsau, to create the institution of the conversialso known as fratres laici, barbati or exteriores in the German Benedictine monasteries. Before this there were certainly men-servants in the monasteries, but they lived outside the monastery, wore no specifically religious clothing and took no vows. Despite ‚Äì or rather, precisely because of ‚Äì the unusually strict monastic discipline and ascetic piety which William introduced from Cluny, Hirsau had become very attractive: the number of choir monks increased from 15 to 150. Due to this increase in its popularity, the existing monastery (dedicated to Saint Aurelius) proved too small, and the community therefore re-settled to the other side of the River Nagold. There, sometime after 1083, was built the largest monastery complex in Germany of the time, with its great Romanesque church dedicated to Saint Peter. William's efforts were not limited to Hirsau. Many monasteries, perhaps as many as 200, both newly founded and long established, embraced the Hirsau Reforms. New abbeys, settled by monks from Hirsau, included Zwiefalten, Blaubeuren, St. Peter im Schwarzwald and St. Georgen im Schwarzwald in Swabia, and Reinhardsbrunn in Thuringia. Already existing monasteries which accepted the reforms included Petershausen near Konstanz, Schaffhausen, Comburg, and St. Peter's in Erfurt. Finally, there were the priories such as Reichenbach in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Sch√∂nrain in Franconia and Fischbachau in Bavaria. He also had a standard edition of the Vulgate made for all the monasteries of the reform. Political implications Support for the reforms came primarily from Swabia and Franconia, with a smaller following in Central and East Germany. The spread of the Hirsau Reforms was directly related to the reputation William had acquired through the ecclesio-political propaganda of the Investiture Controversy, as the main support of Pope Gregory's faction in Germany and in Swabia. He was on the side of the counter-kings Rudolf of Swabia (1077‚Äì1080) and Herman of Luxemburg, Count of Salm (1081‚Äì1088). Among other things, the tenacity of the Gregorian party in south-west Germany was due to him, quite apart from the reputation of Hirsau Abbey among ecclesiastical reformers. When William died on 5 July 1091, the reform party in Swabia and Germany lost an important champion. Legacy Besides composing the Constitutiones HirsaugiensesP. L., CL, 923‚Äì1146 William of Hirsau was the author of the treatises \\"De astronomia\\", of which only the prologue is printedP. L., loc. cit., 1639 and \\"De musica\\".P.

This bee-eater is found in forest clearings. It is found mainly in the Malayan region but extends west into peninsular India. The blue feathers of its throat are elongated and often fluffed giving it its name. They have a loud call but are not as gregarious or active as the smaller bee-eaters, and their square ended tail lacks the typical \\"wires\\" made up of the shafts of the longer central tail feathers in many species. Description The feathers of the chin are long and sometimes raised up into a \\"beard\\". This large bee-eater has a large sickle shaped bill and the square ended tail lacks the \\"wires\\" that are typical of smaller bee-eaters. The bird is grass green with a turquoise forehead, face and chin. The feathers of the throat are elongated giving it a bearded appearance when they are fluffed out. The belly is yellowish to olive with streaks of green or blue. The peninsular Indian populations are said to be paler green than the northeast Indian populations. Although males and females appear similar, the blue throat feathers of the male show higher ultraviolet reflectivity than those of the female. The species is named after Lieut. John Atherton (13th Light Dragoons, died in 1827) a nephew of Mrs. P. J. Selby who obtained a specimen of the bird. Selby described the species in \\"Illustrations of Ornithology\\" published along with Sir William Jardine in 1828. Jardine and Selby described it in the Illustrations of Ornithology (Series 1, Volume 2 part 4, November 1828, plate 58) and the type locality (holotype is in the Selby Collection, UMZC, 25/Mer/7/b/2) was said to be Cachar District Assam by E. C. Stuart Baker but Sir N B Kinnear re-designated Bangalore as the type locality for the species based on the fact that Atherton was posted in Bangalore when he wrote to Selby and noted that he was helped by a French collector (thought to be Leschenault). However the species is rare in that region. Atherton informed Selby that the bird was very rare, found in the thickest jungles, feeding at night and noisy with \\"curr, curr\\" calls. The nominate form is found in India and parts of mainland Southeast Asia while brevicaudatus is an insular population from Hainan. A subspecies bartletti from northeastern India described by W. N. Koelz is subsumed into the nominate population. Distribution and habitat This species is found in a variety of habitats mostly at medium altitudes but below 2000m altitude. Thin to fairly thick forest in medium elevations with clearings is the typical habitat. It is found singly or in small groups of up to three and is very patchily distributed. Their presence in an area can easily be missed. It has been reported from the hill regions of the Satpuras, Western Ghats, Eastern Ghats, Nilgiris, Chota Nagpur and from the Sub-Himalayan forests. Behaviour and ecology left This bird has a loud call, but does not call frequently. It is also not as active as the smaller bee-eaters. The calls include cackling hornbill like calls, a dry \\"Kit-tik... Kit-tik\\" in a series or hollow nasal \\"kyao\\" calls. Pairs may engage in duets of cackling and rattling which ends in short purring notes. The flight is undulating and very barbet-like. The breeding season is February to August in India and courtship involves ritual feeding, bowing and tail fanning. Nest excavation may begin a month before the laying of eggs. The nest is a deep tunnel in a mud bank within which four very spherical and white eggs are laid. The species appears to feed mainly on bees. It exploits the defensive behavior of Giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) colonies by provoking the mass release of guard bees which are then caught and eaten as they pursue the bird. Although mainly foraging using aerial sallies, it is known to glean from bark. They may sometimes associate with mixed-species foraging flocks. Birds have been seen at flowers of Erythrina and Salmalia although it is unclear whether they fed on nectar or insects attracted to the flowers. A blood parasite Leucocytozoon nyctyornis has been described from this species and feather parasites Brueelia are also known.

Literally, bashing is a term meaning to hit or assault, but when it is used as a suffix, or in conjunction with a noun indicating the subject being attacked, it is normally used to imply that the act is motivated by bigotry. The term is also used metaphorically, to describe verbal or critical assaults. Topics which attract bashing tend to be highly partisan and personally sensitive topics for the bashers, the victims, or both. Common areas include religion, nationality, sexuality, and politics. Physical bashing is differentiated from regular assault because it is a motivated assault, which may be considered a hate crime. In relation to non-physical bashing, the term is used to imply that a verbal or critical attack is similarly unacceptable and similarly prejudicial. Use of the term in this manner is an abusive ad hominem action, used to denounce the attack and admonish the attackers by comparing them to perpetrators of physical bashing. Karen Franklin, in her paper \\"Psychosocial motivations of hate crimes perpetrators\\" identifies the following motivations for bashing: socially instilled prejudice or partisan conflict; the perception that the bashing subject is in some way contrary to, or in offense to, an underlying ideology; group or peer influence.https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED423939.pdf Physical bashing  One of the more common uses of the term bashing is to describe assault or vilification of people perceived to be homosexual. Gay-bashing is related to homophobia and religious objections to homosexuality. Non-physical bashing In cases of non-physical bashing, the term is normally used with the intention of having a pejorative effect on the identified bashers by comparing them to perpetrators of criminal assaults. Sometimes this label is applied to criticisms that are not particularly vehement nor even inappropriate. In these cases, the term can be seen to be applied purely for partisan benefit. The use of the term within this context is most common in editorial or personal commentary. These terms are used to imply that the criticism of these groups or individuals is excessive, too frequent, uncompromising, or inappropriate. Since politics is inherently partisan, the term bashing is frequently used to cast negative aspersions on critics for political gain. Fans of different artistic works often accuse critics, who may be other fans, of bashing the subject or individuals upon which the fandom is centered. A common example of this on the internet is Lucas bashing, where the term is used to decry criticism of Star Wars or George Lucas personally. In this case, again the motivations include partisan conflict (for or against an aspect of an artistic work); an offense to an underlying ideology (nostalgic attachment to, or immersion in, an artistic genre); and the group influence of other fans and discussion forums. There is also character bashing, which happens when a part of the fandom openly criticises one or more characters in an artistic work, or even real people from media industry.

Terlezki was born in Antonivka, a village near the town of Tlumach in what is now western Ukraine but was then part of Poland. Terlezki experienced life in both Nazi Germany, and the Soviet Union, which made him a powerful voice against totalitarian governments. Early life Terlezki was brought up in the nearby farming community of Antonivka, where his first teacher at the village school was the Ukrainian poet Mariyka Pidhiryanka. His father Oleksa Terletskyj was a peasant farmer who also worked at a brickworks, where he organised a sit-in protest for shorter working hours. This led to a period of imprisonment by the Polish authorities. Wartime experiences Western Ukraine was occupied by Russian forces in 1939 and then annexed to the Soviet Union. One of Terlezki's uncles was classified as a kulak after paying some neighbours to help with the harvest. He was arrested and deported to Siberia, a fate also suffered by several of Terlezki's cousins, who were students suspected of Ukrainian nationalism. Oleksa Terletskyj had initially welcomed the Communists and become Antonivka's village chairman but he later resigned. After the German invasion in 1941, Stefan Terlezki was put to forced labour repairing a railway bridge over the river Dniester, damaged during the Red Army retreat. He also witnessed the murder of Jews thrown from the neighbouring road bridge by German soldiers. His father also sent him on errands to aid Jewish villagers by obtaining false baptism certificates for them. Slave labour In 1942 the Germans went to Terlezki's school and drew up a list of children to be sent to the Third Reich as slave labour, including 14 year old Terlezki. After several weeks in holding camps, he became part of a shipment sent in railway cattle wagons to a slave distribution centre in Austria. Most of his consignment of slaves were destined for factory work in Graz but the younger ones were put on sale at a slave market in Voitsberg, Styria. Terlezki was bought by Hansel B√∂hmer, who had been conscripted into Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and was looking for someone to replace him on his family's farm. Terlezki worked on farms near Voitsberg between 1942 and 1945, interrupted only by a spell digging trenches for the German defences at Radkersburg and three weeks imprisonment after his arrest by the Gestapo for insubordination. (He had complained about the treatment of British Prisoners of War). Soviet invasion In May 1945, Voitsberg was occupied by the Russians, who promised to repatriate slave labourers. Terlezki was in a large group who boarded a train thinking they would be taken home but who ended up in a camp in the eastern Austrian province of Burgenland. They were informed that they were being conscripted into the Red Army and would be sent to fight the Japanese. Escape to Britain Terlezki escaped and fled back to Voitsberg, which in July 1945 became part of the British Zone of Occupation in Austria. He was sent to a Displaced Persons' camp in Villach, Carinthia, where he found work in the cookhouse at a British Army base. In 1948, he was allowed to emigrate to Britain, landing at Harwich, and was sent to work as a coalminer in Wales. His catering experience allowed him to find alternative work in the canteen of a miners' hostel. He eventually went into hotel management in the Welsh towns of Porthcawl and Swansea before running his own hotels in Aberystwyth and Cardiff. Politics His political career began in 1968, when he became a Conservative member of Cardiff City Council for the South ward. He stood for Parliament in the two General Elections of 1974, unsuccessfully challenging James Callaghan in Cardiff South East. Terlezki gained greater public prominence by serving as Chairman of his local football club, Cardiff City F.C., between 1975 and 1977. He attracted headlines by advocating the flogging of football hooligans, firmly establishing his reputation as a right-wing Conservative. He refused to travel to the Soviet Union when Cardiff City played Dinamo Tbilisi in the European Cup Winners' Cup, he said he could not risk being sent to Siberia as a Red Army deserter. His father and sister were already in Siberia, sent there during Joseph Stalin's post-war purge of western Ukraine, where nationalist guerrillas fought the reimposition of Russian rule. (Terlezki's mother, Olena, had died in 1943). Parliament He became MP for Cardiff West in the Conservative landslide of 1983. As in other constituencies, his Labour Party opponent suffered a loss of votes to the breakaway Social Democratic Party. In Parliament, Terlezki remained true to his right-wing reputation, introducing a bill to replace the May Day holiday with a day of celebration for Winston Churchill. However, he mostly concentrated on constituency work and secured an increase in his vote at the 1987 election (although a lower percentage). However, through the collapse in support for the Social Democrats, he lost his seat to Labour's Rhodri Morgan. At Westminster, Terlezki also had the chance to do something about his father's plight. He persuaded the Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, to raise the case with his Soviet counterpart, Andrei Gromyko. As a result, in October 1984, his father was flown to London for a monthlong reunionCraven's Newsround, BBC children's television, 30 October 1984 and subsequently allowed to return to Antonivka, where he died in 1986. Terlezki requested a visa to attend the funeral but it was not issued in time. However, he and his Welsh wife, Mary, together with their two daughters, later visited his home village as guests of the Soviet authorities. End of Communism In 1989, Terlezki was appointed as the British Government's representative on the Council of Europe's Human Rights Committee. This was condemned by some Labour opposition MPs because of his previous advocacy of flogging, a view he later renounced. The Conservatives argued that his wartime experiences made him well suited to the role, which involved inspecting prison conditions in different countries, later including former Communist states. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Terlezki became a critical supporter of newly independent Ukraine. He condemned the preservation of close ties with Russia, especially the leasing of military bases in Crimea and argued that more should be done to promote the Ukrainian language and to discourage the use of Russian. In 2003, he visited the European Parliament to press the case for eventual Ukrainian membership of the European Union. In 2002, Terlezki took part in a television documentary about his life story and returned to Voitsberg, where he was reunited with Hansel B√∂hmer's niece. He published his memoirs, From War to Westminster in 2005. He died on 21 February 2006, aged 78.

Growing to long, it is usually brown and cream in colour, but has a different appearance during the mating season, with a gold-coloured body and a much shorter tail. It is an omnivore and frequently makes a variety of vocalizations. Known as the \\"finest tailor of all birds\\", it constructs nests out of plants and spider threads. It mates in the rainy season. It has a very large range and population, which is thought to be increasing. Taxonomy The golden-headed cisticola was described by the naturalists Nicholas Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827 and given the binomial name Malurus exilis. The title page is dated 1826. The specific epithet exilis is the Latin word for \\"small\\", \\"slender\\" or \\"thin\\". It is now placed in the genus Cisticola, which was erected by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. This species has been known by several English names in addition to the golden-headed cisticola, including bright-capped cisticola, bright-headed cisticola, bright-crowned cisticola, gold-capped cisticola, yellow-headed cisticola, exile warbler and fan-tail warbler. It has been called a tailorbird, but it is not closely related to Orthotomus, a genus containing 13 species known as tailorbirds. Twelve subspecies are recognized: * C. e. tytleri Jerdon, 1863 ‚Äì south Nepal and northeast India to north Myanmar and southwest China * C. e. erythrocephalus Blyth, 1851 ‚Äì peninsular India * C. e. equicaudatus Baker, E.C.S., 1924 ‚Äì east Myanmar, Thailand and Indochina * C. e. courtoisi La Touche, 1926 ‚Äì south and east China * C. e. volitans (R.

Although its appearance is similar to the black-backed cisticola (Cisticola eximius), the golden-headed cisticola has a shorter tail during the breeding season. The zitting cisticola (Cisticola juncidis) is also similar, but the \\"rich golden\\" head of the golden-headed cisticola is not present in the zitting cisticola. The male has several characteristics only present during the breeding season, including a golden body colour, a golden-orange head, and a dull chin. It also has a shorter tail; this may be a result of sexual selection as a shorter tail has been shown to improve male reproductive success. Females and males outside of the breeding season are similar in appearance, characterized by a cream-coloured underside and a brown upperside. They have streaks of black or dark brown on the upper part of their body, black wings, and a golden head. Their throat is white and the back of their neck is a dull shade of gold. Aside from being lighter in color, juveniles are similar in appearance to adults. The head of the species is crested when vocalizing.  Behaviour  alt=refer to caption Vocalizations of the C. e. erythrocephalus in the alt=refer to caption The golden-headed cisticola is omnivorous, primarily eating invertebrates such as insects and small slugs, but also eating grass seeds. It typically forages on the ground for food, hiding from its prey among various plants, such as grass, and moving slowly. It usually inhabits a single place throughout its life, but habitat changes sometimes cause it to move to a different location. Records from New Guinea and Tasmania have shown it to be a wandering bird, and it possibly undergoes partial migration in China. It is often difficult to detect in the non- breeding season, which has made it difficult analyze when it travels to different areas. It produces a variety of sounds distinct from other birds, which, according to the Sunshine Coast Council, range from a \\"teewip\\" to a \\"wheezz, whit-whit\\". It is most often found single or in small flocks, but outside of the breeding season groups can be larger. = Breeding = The golden-headed cisticola typically mates during the rainy season, which varies across countries. In Asia, the breeding season is in May‚ÄìJuly in China, April‚ÄìAugust in India, September‚ÄìMarch in Moluccas and Sulawesi, December‚ÄìMarch in New Guinea, and April‚ÄìSeptember in Southeast Asia. It can breed any time of the year in North Australia, while it breeds from January‚ÄìMay in West Australia and October‚ÄìApril in East Australia. In Southeast Australia, breeding usually occurs there in September‚ÄìOctober, and its breeding plumage appears earlier, in July or August. The species can breed other times of the year when rain is falling. It can be monogamous or polygamous, depending on the area. During the breeding season, males sometimes fly and vocalize for display. In these performances, the male \\"climbs vertically, spirals upwards to cruising height of c. 50 m, circles for up to 5 minutes, singing, alternately fluttering and closing wings\\", and then steeply descends to just above the ground. It can repeat this practice immediately or fly to another part of its territory and then do so. The male defends its territory, which in Queensland, Australia, is . The bird constructs its nests in shrubs, grass tussock, and other types of vegetation, no more than above the ground. They are built with green leaves, soft plant down, and grass, with the plants being used so that the nest is camouflaged. Described as the \\"finest tailor of all birds\\" for its nest-making, the species frequently stitches its nest together using spider threads. According to the Maitland Mercury, it constructs the nest by creating holes, \\"threading through cobweb silk\\", and lastly \\"pulling the construction together\\". The nests are built by both sexes, with the female stitching the nest together and the male giving spider web threads to the female. They are round in shape with an entry on the side of them. Three to four eggs are laid at a time, which are incubated by the female, taking 11 days. The rate of eggs that survive to hatch is 32%. After hatching, the female feeds the chicks and the male defends the nest, chasing away animals that come near it. Young remain in the nest for 11‚Äì13 days, during which time the female swallows their feces.  Habitat and distribution  The golden-headed cisticola has a very large range and population, living in the countries of Australia, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. Its extent of occurrence is estimated to be , and it is the most common species of cisticola in Australia and from India to the Philippines. Based on reports of its population size in individual countries, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) believes that the golden-headed cisticola's population is increasing globally. Its population density varies across regions ‚Äì in most areas, about 2‚Äì6 birds are found in a single hectare, while in Kimberley, Western Australia, as many as 26‚Äì27 birds can be in a hectare. Due to its wide range and increasing population, the IUCN Red List lists it as a species of least concern. The species' habitat can be grassy hills, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, rivers, wetlands, or irrigated farmland, in areas where the grass is tall and thick. With the exception of the breeding season, the species mostly prefers to be near the ground.

A pair of permutations f0 and f1 are said to be claw-free if there is no efficient algorithm for computing a claw. The terminology claw free was introduced by Goldwasser, Micali, and Rivest in their 1984 paper, \\"A Paradoxical Solution to the Signature Problem\\" (and later in a more complete journal paper), where they showed that the existence of claw-free pairs of trapdoor permutations implies the existence of digital signature schemes secure against adaptive chosen-message attack. This construction was later superseded by the construction of digital signatures from any one-way trapdoor permutation. The existence of trapdoor permutations does not by itself imply claw-free permutations exist; however, it has been shown that claw-free permutations do exist if factoring is hard. The general notion of claw-free permutation (not necessarily trapdoor) was further studied by Ivan Damg√•rd in his PhD thesis The Application of Claw Free Functions in Cryptography (Aarhus University, 1988), where he showed how to construct Collision Resistant Hash Functions from claw-free permutations. The notion of claw-freeness is closely related to that of collision resistance in hash functions. The distinction is that claw-free permutations are pairs of functions in which it is hard to create a collision between them, while a collision-resistant hash function is a single function in which it's hard to find a collision, i.e. a function H is collision resistant if it's hard to find a pair of distinct values x,y such that :H(x) = H(y). In the hash function literature, this is commonly termed a hash collision. A hash function where collisions are difficult to find is said to have collision resistance. Bit commitment Given a pair of claw-free permutations f0 and f1 it is straightforward to create a commitment scheme. To commit to a bit b the sender chooses a random x, and calculates fb(x). Since both f0 and f1 share the same domain (and range), the bit b is statistically hidden from the receiver. To open the commitment, the sender simply sends the randomness x to the receiver. The sender is bound to his bit because opening a commitment to 1 ‚àí b is exactly equivalent to finding a claw. Notice that like the construction of Collision Resistant Hash functions, this construction does not require that the claw-free functions have a trapdoor.

It was followed by four concurrent 4-issue mini-series, Silver Surfer (April 1, 2006), Super-Skrull (April 12, 2006), Nova (April 19, 2006), and Ronan the Accuser (April 26, 2006). Annihilation was published as a six issue mini series beginning in August 2006. It was followed by two issues of Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus and a new volume of Nova. While not published with the Annihilation banner, Drax the Destroyer: Earthfall #1‚Äì4 (Sept 2005) and Thanos #7‚Äì12 (2004) were preludes to the event. Plot summary =Thanos= Thanos visits the intergalactic prison, the Kyln. With the help of Star-Lord, he defeats the Beyonder. Thanos also befriends Skreet, a chaos mite, and enslaves a former herald of Galactus, the Fallen One.Thanos #7‚Äì12 (2004) =Drax The Destroyer: Earthfall= Drax the Destroyer is on a prison transport ship that crashes in Alaska. He befriends a teenage girl named Cammi and protects the locals from the Blood Brothers, Lunatik, and Paibok. During the battle, Drax gains a new body. A second prison ship arrives and arrests both Drax and Cammi.Drax the Destroyer #1‚Äì4 (Sept ‚Äì Dec 2005) =Annihilation: Prologue= The Annihilation Wave, a large armada of warships, under the control of Annihilus, enters this universe through \\"The Crunch\\", the area of space where the Negative Zone and this Universe meet. The Kyln as well as several neighboring star systems are quickly annexed. The Nova Corps, an intergalactic police force, immediately calls in all Nova Centurions for a top level briefing in Xandar, the Nova Corps home world. During the briefing The Annihilation Wave invades and successfully destroys the planet including all Nova Corp members, save for Richard Rider, a lone human Nova Corps member. Having also been delivered to Xandar prior to the attack, Drax and Cammi also survive the onslaught of The Annihilation Wave. Elsewhere in the galaxy Ronan the Accuser, Supreme Accuser of the Kree Empire, is arrested for treason. The Super-Skrull learns that the Annihilation Wave is moving toward the Skrull empire, while the Silver Surfer decides to investigate.Annihilation: Prologue one-shot (March 2006) =Annihilation: Nova= After the fall of Xandar, Richard Rider, the last surviving known Nova Corps member in the universe, allows Worldmind, the artificial intelligence compiled of the eons of knowledge and experiences of the entire Xandarian race, and the repository for the Nova Force, the cosmic power utilized by all Nova Corps members, to download itself in its entirety into his mind and body in order to prevent itself from being lost to the universe. With the entire knowledge and experiences of the Xandarian culture, as well as the full power of the Nova Force at his disposal, Richard Rider becomes Nova Prime. To compensate for this upgrade, Worldmind creates a new uniform designed to help regulate the immense power of the Nova Force, as well as also augmenting Nova Prime's mental and emotional capacities with its own to in order to prevent Richard Rider from going insane. Nova Prime, along with Drax and Cammi leave what remains of Xandar and speed to the next star system, once there, they find Quasar, wielder of the Quantum Bands assisting in the exodus of one of its star system planets. The Annihilation Wave arrives and Nova Prime and Quasar attack in order to give the exodus enough time to succeed. In the ensuing battle, Quasar is consumed by Annihilus and now wields the Quantum Bands.Annihilation: Nova #1‚Äì4 (Apr ‚Äì July 2006) =Annihilation: Silver Surfer= Annihilus dispatches the Seekers, led by Ravenous, to capture beings imbued with the Power Cosmic. While avoiding them, the Silver Surfer joins forces with other former heralds of Galactus, Firelord and Air-Walker. Air- Walker is killed, and the seekers capture Terrax and Morg in separate engagements. To protect Galactus from the Seekers, Surfer replaces Stardust as his herald. Stardust, Firelord, and Red Shift join the United Front against the Annihilation Wave. Galactus reveals that the Annihilation Wave's destruction of the Kyln may have freed two Proemial Gods, Tenebrous and Aegis, whom he imprisoned when \\"the universe was young.\\" Thanos, guided by Skreet and Mistress Death, allies with Annihilus. Thanos also pursues an alliance with Tenebrous and Aegis. Before they agree to it, they kill the Fallen One.Annihilation: Silver Surfer #1‚Äì4 (April‚ÄìJuly 2006) =Annihilation: Super Skrull= Once the Annihilation Wave reaches the Skrull empire, it begins using a weapon known as the Harvester of Sorrows, a massive ship which renders entire planets into fuel for the armada. Learning that the planet his son lives on is in its path, Kl'rt the Super-Skrull and a young Skrull engineer, R'Kin, travel to the Negative Zone to find a way to stop the Harvester. Kl'rt locates Hawal, the warden of a prison planet and designer of the Harvester. Using torture, Kl'rt forces Hawal to design a virus that can destroy the Harvester. He also unites the planet's prisoners into an army. When Kl'rt brings his army back to the Skrull empire to attack the Harvester, R'Kin betrays them. Kl'rt is able to escape and destroy the Harvester, but not before his son is consumed by it. Kl'rt appears to be killed in the process.Annihilation: Super Skrull #1‚Äì4 (Apr ‚Äì July 2006) =Annihilation: Ronan= On the run from Kree authorities since his trial, Ronan the Accuser seeks Tana Nile, a witness who falsely accused him of treason. Ronan lands on Godthab Omega, where he finds an encampment of exiled Kree, including his old friend Korath, and learns that Tana Nile has joined the Graces, a group of cosmically powered women led by Gamora. After defeating Nebula and Stellaris, Ronan ends up in battle against Gamora herself, who now possesses the power cosmic. However, in truth their conflict, as well as several others, are actually caused by the manipulation of Glorian, who is using the energy from their battles to reshape the world. Just as Glorian's plan approaches completion, the Annihilation Wave attacks Godthab Omega. Ronan, Korath, Gamora, and Glorian all battle Annihilus's forces. Tana Nile is killed, preventing Ronan from proving his innocence. Undeterred, Ronan resolves to return to the Kree, violating his exile to warn them of the coming danger.Annihilation: Ronan #1‚Äì4 (Apr ‚Äì July 2006) =Annihilation= 205 days after Annihilation Day, Richard Rider has formed an army, the United Front, to oppose the Annihilation Wave. His land-based army includes Drax, Gamora, Ronan the Accuser and Peter Quill, while his outer space forces consist primarily of Firelord, Red Shift and Stardust. They capture one of Annihilus' queens, who reveals that Thanos, Tenebrous and Aegis had attacked and incapacitated Galactus and the Silver Surfer. Believing the Power Cosmic to be within his grasp, Annihilus orders his troops to kill the remaining former Heralds of Galactus.Annihilation #1 (Aug 2006) Thanos kidnaps Moondragon and tells Drax via Phyla-Vell that she will be killed if Drax pursues him. Ravenous leads an attack on the United Front and he has many of Nova's former allies in his thrall, including Terrax. During the conflict a huge energy spike restores the deceased Super-Skrull Kl'rt to his full power. Ravenous' troops retreat as Annihilus' ship arrives. With Thanos' aid, Annihilus has turned an imprisoned Galactus into a weapon. The United Front is broken and defeated. In the aftermath of the battle, Nova sends out a warning to the heroes of Earth about the approaching wave. Drax stays behind to hunt and kill Thanos.Annihilation #2‚Äì3 (Sept‚ÄìOct 2006) Thanos had allied himself with Annihilus out of curiosity. When he learns Annihilus' plan is to extinguish all life in the universe, Thanos plans to betray him by releasing Galactus. Just before he can do so, Drax appears and kills him.Annihilation #4 (Oct 2006) Drax and Moondragon then release the Silver Surfer, who in turn releases Galactus. At the same time, Ronan the Accuser and a small band of allies (including Ronan's sworn enemy, the Super-Skrull) arrive on the homeworld of ruling Kree House Fiyero. Ronan learns that House Fiyero had allied themselves with Ravenous and Annihilus. Ronan kills the members of Fiyero and is called by the populace to be the new emperor.Annihilation #5 (Nov 2006) Galactus proceeds to unleash a massive, omnidirectional blast that later becomes known as the \\"Galactus event.\\" Silver Surfer is sent ahead of the blast by Galactus to herald the imminent destruction, as the unleashed \\"Galactus obliteration perimeter\\" wipes out the majority of the Annihilation Wave, more than three star systems and even vaporizes a Watcher. Nova, Peter Quill and Phyla-Vell have teleported close to Annihilus' flagship and are preparing to make the last jump when Galactus' energy wave arrives. Annihilus, finding that he has been betrayed by Thanos and undone by Galactus, uses Quasar's quantum bands to protect himself from the energy blast. Nova battles Annihilus, but is unable to win until Phyla manages to steal the Quantum bands from Annihilus. Nova kills the weakened villain. A treaty between the remains of the Annihilation Wave and the Kree was signed, ceding certain Kree territories to Ravenous. This ends the overt hostilities, but both sides are unhappy.Annihilation #6 (Dec 2006) =Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus= After being captured, enslaved and made a pawn of Annihilus, Terrax has broken free...only to crash-land on a planet ruled by the Space Parasite. He decides to destroy this murderous entity as a way to regain his honor.Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus #1 (Jan 2007) Stardust returns from death and re-devotes himself to Galactus. As proof of his commitment, Stardust feeds the last of his race to the malnourished Galactus. Galactus sends the Silver Surfer to track Tenebrous and Aegis. Surfer ends up destroying them with the energy of the Crunch.Annihilation: Heralds of Galactus #2 (Feb 2007) Firelord tracks down many of the Centurians‚ÄîAnnihilus's elite force that murdered his homeworld and many other worlds. He kills some, but others plead for mercy, saying they were tricked. Firelord allows them to live, but only if they behave from that moment on. Sequels and spin-offs After the Annihilation event concluded, Marvel announced a new Nova ongoing series, written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning, as well as a second crossover event in a similar format, Annihilation Conquest, by the same authors.Cosmic Conquistadors: DNA Talk \\"Annihilation : Conquest Prologue\\" & \\"Nova\\", Comic Book Resources, March 30, 2007 The second volume of Guardians of the Galaxy, which began in 2008, features several of the characters in Annihilation. In November and December 2019, Marvel released Annihilation: Scourge, a six issue storyline where Annihilus works with Nova, the Fantastic Four, Beta Ray Bill, and the Silver Surfer to stop a different invading army. Other versions =What If?= In a special What If by David Hine and Mico Suayan,Annihilation Makes Things Civil: Hine talks \\"What If? Annihilation\\", Comic Book Resources, October 5, 2007 the Annihilation Wave reaches Earth in the climatic battle of the Civil War between Iron Man's Pro- Superhuman Registration Act side and Captain America's Anti-Superhuman Registration Act side. Nova is outraged the heroes are fighting over secret identities when such a massive threat is coming, revealing that in this world, Drax was unable to revive Galactus and thus the Wave continued its march, taking much of the Kree Empire along with Ronan and the Super-Skrull. The Wave hits Earth in a massive strike on multiple cities, the heroes and villains uniting to fight it off while sustaining massive casualties. With more of Annihilus' forces coming, this reality's Watcher tells the heroes that the Terminus device can be used to open a black hole to suck the fleet away. With the help of the Inhumans, they trick Annihilus into sending his forces toward the moon. Nova intends to stay and set the device off and Captain America and Iron Man volunteer to help him fight off the Wave to buy Earth time. The three sacrifice themselves to set off the device, sucking the Wave into the black hole and leaving Earth ravaged but still alive.

The male has a blue-grey head and a red-brown body. The female is much plainer, with pale brown plumage similar to that of the larger Eurasian collared dove. Novotel - Bangkok Taxonomy The red collared dove was formally described by the French naturalist Johann Hermann in 1804 and given the binomial name Columba tranquebarica. The specific epithet is from the town Tranquebar, now Tharangambadi, on the Coromandel Coast in southern India. The red turtle dove is now placed in the genus Streptopelia that was introduced in 1855 by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek streptos meaning \\"collar\\" and peleia meaning \\"dove\\". Two subspecies are recognised: * S. t. humilis (Temminck, 1824) ‚Äì eastern Nepal, northeastern India and northeastern Tibet to northern China and the Philippines * S. t. tranquebarica (Hermann, 1804) ‚Äì Pakistan, peninsular India, western Nepal  Description  Bang Pa-In Palace, Thailand The red collared dove is a relatively small species, with a length of and a weight of around . The male has a bluish head and light red-brown body with a black ring round its neck, while the female is similar but pinkish all over. Distribution and habitat This dove is essentially a plains species, extending to Taiwan and the Philippines but uncommon on the Indonesian archipelago (avoiding rocky foothills), and an Oriental species. There is, however, a summer migration into the broader cultivated valleys of Afghania where it breeds. It is the most common dove throughout Punjab. It is a summer migrant visitor to India, where it is more or less resident. It prefers better-wooded tracts such as canal or roadside tree plantations and avoids extensive desert regions. When they first arrive they are often in small flocks, but they soon split up and start pair formation and breeding. Status The red collared dove has an extremely large range. The population size has not been quantified, but is believed to be large. There is some evidence for a decline in the population, but the decline is slow and the species has been evaluated by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as of Least Concern.

IST may be caused by the sinus node itself having an abnormal structure or function, or it may be part of a problem called dysautonomia, a disturbance and/or failure of the autonomic nervous system. Research into the mechanism and etiology (cause) of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is ongoing. IST is viewed by most to be a benign condition in the long-term. Symptoms of IST, however, may be distracting and warrant treatment. The heart is a strong muscle and typically can sustain the higher-than-normal heart rhythm, though monitoring the condition is generally recommended. The mechanism and primary etiology of inappropriate sinus tachycardia has not been fully elucidated. An autoimmune mechanism has been suggested, as several studies have detected autoantibodies that activate beta adrenoreceptors in some patients. The mechanism of the arrhythmia primarily involves the sinus node and peri-nodal tissue and does not require the AV node for maintenance. Treatments in the form of pharmacological therapy or catheter ablation are available, but the condition is currently difficult to treat successfully.  Symptoms  Symptoms reported by patients vary in frequency and severity. They may include: * Frequent or sustained palpitations * Dyspnea (shortness of breath) and palpitations on exertion * Pre-syncope (feeling as if about to faint) *Fatigue * Dizziness * Exercise intolerance * Occasional paresthesia and cramping * Symptoms associated with autonomic nervous system disturbance, including gastrointestinal disturbance  Diagnosis  No formal diagnostic criteria exist. A diagnosis of inappropriate sinus tachycardia is primarily one of exclusion, and the following may be observed: * Exclusion of all other causes of sinus tachycardia * Common forms of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) must be excluded * Normal P wave morphology * A resting sinus tachycardia is usually (but not always) present * Nocturnal dip in heart rate * Inappropriate heart rate response on exertion * Mean heart rate in 24hrs >95 bpm * Symptoms are documented to be due to tachycardia *Hypotension is occasionally observed * Syncope (fainting) is occasionally reported  Treatment  IST has been treated both pharmacologically and invasively, with varying degrees of success. IST, in and of itself, is not indicative of higher rates of mortality, and non-treatment is an option chosen by many if they have minimal symptoms. Some types of medication tried by cardiologists and other physicians include: beta blockers, selective sinus node If channel inhibitors (such as ivabradine), calcium channel blockers, and antiarrhythmic agents. Some SSRI drugs are also occasionally tried, as are treatments more commonly used to treat postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, such as fludrocortisone. Invasive treatments include forms of catheter ablation such as sinus node modification (selective ablation of the sinus node), complete sinus node ablation (with associated implantation of a permanent artificial pacemaker), and AV node ablation in very resistant cases (creation of iatrogenic complete heart block, necessitating implantation of a permanent artificial pacemaker). However, invasive treatments can also make the symptoms worse.

It was originally hosted by Michael Williamson (also a football commentator for HSV) and comedian Mary Hardy. Production ad synopsis The program, screening each Saturday night from around 8.30 pm (the starting time varied over the years depending on HSV-7's Saturday night VFL football commitments), was a mix of comedy, light entertainment and live coverage of harness racing from the RAS Showgrounds and, later, Moonee Valley racecourse. The weekly lottery draw Tattslotto was incorporated as a segment in the program from around 1972. The Penthouse Club was considered a welcome alternative on Saturday nights which is often regarded as a wasteland of reruns and low-grade movies on other channels. The long-time musical director for the program was Ivan Hutchinson. In 1978, Williamson was replaced by Ernie Sigley and the program was retitled Saturday Night Live (with no relation to the NBC show) in 1979. Hardy left the program during 1978. The predecessor programs were Sunnyside Up and Club Seven. Rival television station ATV-10 attempted to resurrect the format in 1980 with little success. Also during the 1970s, Adelaide television station ADS-7 produced their own version of The Penthouse Club with Bob Francis, Anne Wills and Sandy Roberts - with the program and presenters winning a number of TV Week Logie Awards for popularity in South Australia.

It provided a highly visible, recognizable, and high-level entry point for outside thinkers and researchers. NIAC encouraged proposers to think decades into the future in pursuit of concepts that would \\"leapfrog\\" the evolution of contemporary aerospace systems. While NIAC sought advanced concept proposals that stretch the imagination, these concepts were expected to be based on sound scientific principles and attainable within a 10 to 40-year time frame. From February 1998 to 2007, NIAC received a total of 1,309 proposals and awarded 126 Phase I grants and 42 Phase II contracts for a total value of $27.3 million.NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, 9th Annual & Final Report, 2006-2007, Performance Period July 12, 2006 - August 31, 2007 (page 9, Executive Summary, 4th paragraph) NASA announced on March 1, 2011 that the NIAC concept would be re-established at NASA with similar goals,Marcia S. Smith, \\"NIAC2 Gets Underway at NASA, Two Other Technology Solicitations Announced\\", SpacePolicyOnline, 02-Mar-2011 (accessed 6 Sept. 2012)NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts web page (accessed 1 August 2012) maintaining the acronym NIAC. =NIAC 1998‚Äì2007= Studies funded by the original NIAC 1998‚Äì2007 include * Bio-Nano-Machines for Space Applications - Constantinos Mavroidis * System Feasibility Demonstrations of Caves and Subsurface Constructs for Mars Habitation and Scientific Exploration (Caves of Mars Project) - Penelope J.

Edwards =Closing of the Original NIAC= On July 2, 2007, NIAC announced that \\"NASA, faced with the constraints of achieving the Vision for Space Exploration, has made the difficult decision to terminate NIAC, which has been funded by NASA since inception. Effective August 31, 2007, the original NIAC organization ceased operations.\\"The NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts (NIAC) is Closing\\", SpaceRef - Space News as it Happens, posted Monday, July 2, 2007 (accessed 5 September 2012) Revised NIAC Following the termination of the original NIAC program, Congress requested a review of the NIAC program by the United States National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences.Marcia S. Smith, \\"NRC Calls for Reinstatement of NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts\\", SpacePolicyOnline, 10-Aug-2009 (accessed 6 Sept. 2012) The review was done in 2009, and concluded that in order to achieve its mission, NASA needs \\"a mechanism to investigate visionary, far-reaching advanced concepts,\\" and recommended that NIAC, or a NIAC-like program, should be reestablished. Consistent with this recommendation, it was announced on March 1, 2011 that the NIAC was to be revived with similar goals leading to the establishment in 2011 of a project within the NASA Office of Chief Technologist, the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts, maintaining the acronym NIAC. It is now part of the NASA Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD).NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) web page (accessed July 10, 2013.) According to Michael Gazarik, director of NASA's Space Technology Program, \\"Through the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program, NASA is taking the long-term view of technological investment and the advancement that is essential for accomplishing our missions. We are inventing the ways in which next-generation aircraft and spacecraft will change the world and inspiring Americans to take bold steps.\\"David Szondy, \\"NASA announces advanced technology proposals\\", 'gizmag, August 5, 2012 (accessed 9 August 2012) =2011 NIAC Project Selections= The revived NIAC, with the slightly-changed name \\"NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts,\\" funded thirty phase-I studies in 2011 to investigate advanced concepts.Frank Morring, Jr., \\"NASA Starts Spending On Advanced Technology\\", Aviation Week, August 15, 2011 (accessed 9 August 2012)NASA Office of the Chief Technologist, 2011 NIAC Phase I Selections (accessed 1 August 2012) *Duda, Kevin: Variable Vector Countermeasure Suit (V2Suit) for Space Habitation and Exploration *Ferguson, Scott: Enabling All-Access Mobility for Planetary Exploration Vehicles via Transformative Reconfiguration *Gilland, James: The Potential for Ambient Plasma Wave Propulsion *Gregory, Daniel: Space Debris Elimination (SpaDE) *Hogue, Michael: Regolith Derived Heat Shield for a Planetary Body Entry and Descent System with In-Situ Fabrication *Hohman, Kurt: Atmospheric Breathing Electric Thruster for Planetary Exploration *Howe, Steven: Economical Radioisotope Power *Khoshnevis, Behrokh: Contour Crafting Simulation Plan for Lunar Settlement Infrastructure Build-Up *Kwiat, Paul: Entanglement-assisted Communication System for NASA's Deep-Space Missions: Feasibility Test and Conceptual Design *Mankins, John: SPS-ALPHA: The First Practical Solar Power Satellite via Arbitrarily Large PHased Array *Miller, David: High-temperature Superconductors as Electromagnetic Deployment and Support Structures in Spacecraft *Paul, Michael: Non-Radioisotope Power Systems For Sunless Solar System Exploration Missions *Pavone, Marco: Spacecraft/Rover Hybrids for the Exploration of Small Solar System Bodies *Ritter, Joe: Ultra-Light \\"Photonic Muscle\\" Space Structures *Scott, Gregory: Low Power Microrobotics Utilizing Biologically Inspired Energy Generation *Short, Kendra: Printable Spacecraft *Sibille, Laurent: In-Space Propulsion Engine Architecture based on Sublimation of Planetary Resources: from exploration robots to NEO mitigation *Silvera, Isaac: Metallic Hydrogen: A Game Changing Rocket Propellant *Slough, John: Nuclear Propulsion through Direct Conversion of Fusion Energy *Staehle, Robert: Interplanetary CubeSats: Opening the Solar System to a Broad Community at Lower Cost *Strekalov, Dmitry: Ghost Imaging of Space Objects *Stysley, Paul: Laser-Based Optical Trap for Remote Sampling of Interplanetary and Atmospheric Particulate Matter *Swartzlander, Grover: Steering of Solar Sails Using Optical Lift Force *Tarditi, Alfonso: Aneutronic Fusion Spacecraft Architecture *Thibeault, Sheila: Radiation Shielding Materials Containing Hydrogen, Boron, and Nitrogen: Systematic Computational and Experimental Study *Tripathi, Ram: Meeting the Grand Challenge of Protecting Astronaut's Health: Electrostatic Active Space Radiation Shielding for Deep Space Missions *Werka, Robert: Proposal for a Concept Assessment of a Fission Fragment Rocket Engine (FFRE) Propelled Spacecraft *Westover, Shayne: Radiation Protection and Architecture Utilizing High Temperature Superconducting Magnets *Whittaker, William: Technologies Enabling Exploration of Skylights, Lava Tubes and Caves *Wie, Bong: Optimal Dispersion of Near-Earth Objects =2012 NIAC Project Selections= In August 2012, NIAC announcedDavid E.

Life Otloh was born around 1010 in the bishopric of Freising. After studying at Tegernsee and Hersfeld, he was called to W√ºrzburg by Bishop Meinhard (due, Otloh tells us in his Book of Visions, to his skill as a scribe). Otloh served as a secular cleric in the diocese of Freising before pursuing a monastic career against the wishes of his father; he eventually took monastic vows in 1032 at St. Emmeram's, Regensburg. Appointed dean in 1055, he also was magister scholae (head of the monastic school), and numbered among his students the reforming abbot William of Hirsau (‚Ä†1091). Otloh was among the authors who elaborated the story of the transfer of the relics of Saint Denis the Areopagite to Regensburg, and long was believed to have forged letters of exemption for his monastery, a charge which recently has begun to be reconsidered.On the Translatio sancti Dionysii, see most recently Schmid, \\"'Auf gl√ºhendem Thron in der H√∂lle'.\\" Otloh's role in the forgeries was asserted by Johannes Lechner, \\"Zu den falschen Exemtionsprivilegien f√ºr St. Emmeram (Regensburg),\\" Neues Archiv 25 (1900): 627-35; see more recently, however, Philipp-Schauwecker, \\"Otloh und die St. Emmeramer F√§lschungen des 11. Jahrhunderts\\". Conflicts with his abbot and bishop led Otloh to leave St. Emmeram's in 1062 for Fulda, where he remained until 1067. After a short stay at the Franconian monastery of Amorbach, he returned to Regensburg and spent the rest of his days on literary work, most notably a quasi-autobiographical account of the temptations he had overcome during his life (the Liber de tentationibus suis) and a collection of visionary tales, including his own (the Liber visionum). Otloh appears to have been the music theory teacher of Wilhelm of Hirsau and is cited in his treatise \\"De musica,\\" but no treatise on music by Otloh is extant. Several liturgical chants in manuscripts from St. Emmeram are in his hand, some of which he probably composed, including the sequence for St. Dionysius \\"Exultemus in ista fratres,\\" a proper office for St. Dionysius, and the troped Kyrie \\"O pater immense.\\" Works Otloh's works are collected in volume 146 of Migne, Patrologia Latina, columns 27-434, including: :Dialogus de suis tentationibus, varia fortuna et scriptis :Life of Saint Wolfgang of Regensburg :Life of Saint Boniface :Life of Saint Alto :Life of Saint Magnus :Dialogus de tribus qu√¶stionibus :De promissionis bonorum et malorum causis :De cursu spirituali :De translatione s.

His Wisden obituary described him as \\"an allround cricketer of sterling merit\\". His Cricinfo profile, meanwhile, declares that \\"More than any other player, Arnold was responsible for the elevation of Worcestershire to first-class status.\\" With his eighteen tons and well nigh 1,000 wickets in the County Championship, \\"his adopted county [... could] take on any opponent\\". Arnold bowled at upwards of medium pace, with variations, and seamed the ball consistently. He took full toll advantage of his physical stature, bowling with an upright action and, like Bill Bowes, obtaining considerable lift off the wicket. This was an especially effective ploy on wickets afflicted by rain. He swung the ball substantially, especially away from the bat. As a batsman, Arnold had a strong command over almost every stroke in the book ‚Äî most of them he played with considerable power ‚Äî and an impressively dense defence. He was a fine slips fieldsman with a safe pair of hands. A tough cricketer, he was the only batsman who put up a fight when his team fell for a dismal 43 against Yorkshire in 1900. He was a member of three Test series-winning England teams, the most noteworthy of which came under the captaincy of Plum Warner in 1903‚Äì04, a series he kicked off with the removal of openers Reggie Duff and Victor Trumper before the score had reached double figures. He also contributed a great deal to the Fourth-Test victory: although dismissed for a pair, he took four wickets in the first innings and dismissed Trumper twice. His nephews John Price and William Price both had brief first-class careers with Worcestershire.  References  *Ted Arnold.

Andrews over his grave, in Lower Circular Road Christian Cemetery ‚Äì Kolkata (earlier Calcutta) Charles Freer Andrews (12 February 1871 ‚Äì 5 April 1940) was a priest of the Church of England. A Christian missionary, educator and social reformer in India, he became a close friend of Rabindranath Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi and identified with the cause of India's independence. He was instrumental in convincing Gandhi to return to India from South Africa, where Gandhi had been a leading light in the Indian civil rights struggle. C. F. Andrews was affectionately dubbed Christ's Faithful Apostle by Gandhi, based on his initials, C.F.A. For his contributions to the Indian Independence Movement Gandhi and his students at St. Stephen's College, Delhi, named him Deenabandhu, or \\"Friend of the Poor\\". Early life Charles Freer Andrews was born on 12 February 1871 at 14 Brunel Terrace, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, United Kingdom; his father was the \\"Angel\\" (bishop) of the Catholic Apostolic Church in Birmingham. The family had suffered financial misfortune because of the duplicity of a friend, and had to work hard to make ends meet. Andrews was a pupil at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and afterwards read Classics at Pembroke College, Cambridge. During this period he moved away from his family's church and was accepted for ordination in the Church of England. In 1896 Andrews became a deacon, and took over the Pembroke College Mission in south London. A year later he was made priest, and became Vice-Principal of Westcott House Theological College in Cambridge. In India Andrews had been involved in the Christian Social Union since university, and was interested in exploring the relationship between a commitment to the Gospel and a commitment to justice, through which he was attracted to struggles for justice throughout the British Empire, especially in India. In 1904 he joined the Cambridge Mission to Delhi and arrived there to teach philosophy at St. Stephen's College, where he grew close to many of his Indian colleagues and students. Increasingly dismayed by the racist behaviour and treatment of Indians by some British officials and civilians, he supported Indian political aspirations, and wrote a letter in the Civil and Military Gazette in 1906 voicing these sentiments. Andrews soon became involved in the activities of the Indian National Congress, and he helped to resolve the 1913 cotton workers' strike in Madras. With Gandhi in South Africa Known for his persuasiveness, intellect and moral rectitude, he was asked by senior Indian political leader Gopal Krishna Gokhale to visit South Africa and help the Indian community there to resolve their political disputes with the Government. Arriving in January 1914, he met the 44-year-old Gujarati lawyer, Mohandas Gandhi, who was leading the Indian community's efforts against the racial discrimination and police legislation that infringed their civil liberties. Andrews was deeply impressed with Gandhi's knowledge of Christian values and his espousal of the concept of ahimsa (nonviolence) ‚Äì something that Gandhi mixed with inspiration from elements of Christian anarchism. Andrews served as Gandhi's aide in his negotiations with General Jan Smuts and was responsible for finalizing some of the finer details of their interactions. Guha, Ramachandra, Gandhi Before India, Knopf; F., 2013, pp. 505-506. Following the advice of several Indian Congress leaders and of Principal Susil Kumar Rudra, of St. Stephen's College, Andrews was instrumental in persuading Gandhi to return to India with him in 1915. Tagore and Sree Narayana Guru In 1918 Andrews disagreed with Gandhi's attempts to recruit combatants for World War I, believing that this was inconsistent with their views on nonviolence. In Mahatma Gandhi's Ideas Andrews wrote about Gandhi's recruitment campaign: \\"Personally I have never been able to reconcile this with his own conduct in other respects, and it is one of the points where I have found myself in painful disagreement.\\" Andrews was elected President of the All India Trade Union in 1925 and 1927. Andrews developed a dialogue between Christians and Hindus. He spent a lot of time at Santiniketan in conversation with the poet and philosopher Rabindranath Tagore. He also supported the movement to ban the ‚Äòuntouchability of outcasts‚Äô. In 1919 he joined the famous Vaikom Satyagraha, and in 1933 assisted B.R. Ambedkar in formulating the demands of the Dalits. Once C.F. Andrews, along with Rabindranath Tagore, visited Sree Narayana Guru, a spiritual leader from Kerala, South India. Then he wrote to Romain Rolland; that I have seen our Christ walking on the shore of Arabian sea in the attire of a hindu sanyasin . He and Agatha Harrison arranged for Gandhi's visit to the UK.Agatha Harrison, Open University, Retrieved 20 March 2017 He accompanied Gandhi to the second Round Table Conference in London, helping him to negotiate with the British government on matters of Indian autonomy and devolution.  In Fiji  When the news reached India, through the writings of Christian missionaries J. W. Burton, Hannah Dudley, and R. Piper and a returned indentured labourer, Totaram Sanadhya, of the mistreatment of Indian indentured labourers in Fiji, the Indian Government in September 1915 sent Andrews and William W. Pearson to make inquiries. The two visited numerous plantations and interviewed indentured labourers, overseers and Government officials and on their return to India also interviewed returned labourers. In their \\"Report on Indentured Labour in Fiji\\" Andrews and Pearson highlighted the ills of the indenture system; which led to the end of further transportation of Indian labour to the British colonies. In 1917 Andrews made a second visit to Fiji, and although he reported some improvements, was still appalled at the moral degradation of indentured labourers. He called for an immediate end to indenture; and the system of Indian indentured labour was formally abolished in 1920. In 1936, while on a visit to Australia and New Zealand, Andrews was invited to and visited Fiji again. The ex-indentured labourers and their descendants wanted him to help them overcome a new type of slavery, by which they were bound to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, which controlled all aspects of their lives. Andrews, however, was delighted with the improvements in conditions since his last visit, and asked Fiji Indians to \\"remember that Fiji belonged to the Fijians and they were there as guests.\\" Later life About this time Gandhi reasoned with Andrews that it was probably best for sympathetic Britons like himself to leave the freedom struggle to Indians. So from 1935 onwards Andrews began to spend more time in Britain, teaching young people all over the country about Christ's call to radical discipleship. Gandhi's affectionate nickname for Andrews was Christ‚Äôs Faithful Apostle, based on the initials of his name, \\"C.F.A\\". He was widely known as Gandhi's closest friend and was perhaps the only major figure to address Gandhi by his first name, Mohan. Charlie Andrews died on 5 April 1940, during a visit to Calcutta, and is buried in the 'Christian Burial ground' of Lower Circular Road cemetery, Calcutta. Commemoration He is widely commemorated and respected in India. Two undergraduate colleges of the University of Calcutta, the Dinabandhu Andrews College, and the Dinabandhu Institution and one High School in Salimpur area of south Kolkata commemorate his name. The Dinabandhu Andrews College was constituted with an aim of disseminating higher education to a huge number of children of the displaced persons from erstwhile East Pakistan, presently Bangladesh.Dinabandhu Andrews College Even in South India, he was remembered by naming hospitals as Deenabandhu. One such was Deenabandhu Hospital, Thachampara, Palakkad, Kerala He was a major character, portrayed by British actor Ian Charleson, in the 1982 film, Gandhi, by Richard Attenborough. He is honored with a feast day in the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on 12 February. In 1971, India issued a commemorative postage stamp to mark the birth centenary of Andrews. Publications * Hakim Ajmal Khan A sketch of his life and career. Madras: G. A. Natesan.

The Central Science Laboratory (CSL) was an executive agency of the UK government branch, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). It is now part of the Food and Environment Research Agency, which is in turn part of DEFRA. It specialises in sciences which form the basis of agriculture for sustainable crop production, environmental management and conservation and in food safety and quality. It also houses FAPAS and the National Collection of Plant Pathogenic Bacteria. The Central Science laboratory (CSL) was the UK's foremost public sector laboratory in the fields of agriculture, food and the environment. As an Executive Agency of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), CSL was responsible for the delivery of science in support of Government objectives. Officially launched in 1992 CSL‚Äôs scientific expertise dates back to 1914, through the bringing together scientific expertise vested in a number of other scientific laboratories. A new facility at Sand Hutton was completed in 1996 for 134 million pounds the moving of the Aberdeen and Norwich facilities to the Sand Hutton site was not part of the initial centralization plan but was subsequently carried out. The site is now the home of The Food and Environment Research Agency. Facilities =Slough, Tolworth, Worplesdon Laboratories= In 1929 the Hurworth Estate, Slough - consisting of a moderate-sized house and out-buildings, with adjoining land - was purchased by the Imperial College of Science and Technology for use as a biological field station. The grounds were used by the Botany Department for growing experimental crops and the main house by the Department of Zoology and Entomology and the Department of Agricultural Chemistry as a base for investigations into the biology and control of insect pests of cargoes of cacao and dried fruit stored in warehouses in London. In 1938 concern over the Government's strategic storage of grain and flour led to a survey of pests of stored commodities. The survey revealed the need for long-term research and in 1940 the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, which was responsible for the bulk of government-financed research on food, set up the Pest Infestation Laboratory on the Slough site. Research initially focused on protecting the security of foodstuffs held under wartime conditions. At this time the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) set up the Infestation Control Laboratory at a site in Tolworth, Greater London, to carry out R&D; into food losses to rodents. The research programme of the laboratory was extended in 1958 with an additional field station in Worplesdon, Surrey, set up to undertake research into problems in the field caused by birds and mammals other than rodents. Responsibility for the Pest Infestation Laboratory at Slough passed to the Agricultural Research Council in 1959 and in 1970 the laboratory was again transferred, this time to The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF). Following the transfer, the Pest Infestation Laboratory was amalgamated with the Infestation Control Laboratory at Tolworth and Worplesdon. The newly merged laboratories were renamed the Pest Infestation Control Laboratory. In 1971 management of the laboratory was transferred to the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) a new division within MAFF set up to bring together MAFF's professional, technical and scientific services. In the mid 1970s the Pest Infestation Control Laboratory set up additional field stations in Gloucestershire and Hampshire. Field based research and ecology studies continued at these outstations until transfer to The Food and Environment Research Agency. =Harpenden Laboratory= In 1914 the Institute for Plant Pathology was set up at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in response to the growing problem of new pests and diseases being brought into the country on plants collected during international expeditions. Food shortages of World War I, and the realisation that production would need to be increased after the War, stimulated the Food Production Department in 1917 to start an intelligence and survey service on plant pests and diseases. A re-organisation of the Institute in 1918 resulted in the formation of the Plant Pathology Laboratory. The new laboratory took over the Institute's intelligence and survey function and also advised the Minister on the steps needed to prevent both the introduction of destructive new pests and diseases and the further spread of dangerous ones that had already gained a foothold in the country. In 1920 the Plant Pathology Laboratory moved from Kew to a converted private house in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. In 1960 the work of the laboratory had expanded significantly and it relocated to a new purpose-built complex in Harpenden. The new site ‚Äì in total approximately of land - included 2-3 acres of experimental plots. Work was organised over three departments - Entomology, Plant Pathology and Chemistry - and included the Pesticide Registration Department. An outstation in Cambridge also carried out research on pesticide residues. In 1971 MAFF's professional, technical and scientific services were brought together within the newly set up Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS). Along with the Pest Infestation Control Laboratory, the Plant Pathology Laboratory now operated as a science laboratory within the Agricultural Science Service (one of five services of ADAS). In 1979 the Plant Pathology Laboratory was renamed Harpenden Laboratory. =Torry Research Station= In 1929 the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) set up a research station in Torry, Aberdeen to carry out R&D; into fish preservation due to growing concern surrounding the loss of thousands of tons of fish annually through decay. The Officer in Charge was George Adam Reay retitled in 1937 as Director. World War II had a significant impact on Torry's research programme and during the 1940s the research station took on a more advisory role; developing innovative ways to use underutilized fish and making cheaper cuts of fish more palatable to make rations go further. In 1952 Torry set up a branch laboratory - The Humber Laboratory, Hull - providing valuable contact with the regional fishing industry and undertaking complementary research to Torry such as R&D; on the fish smoking process, the quality of frozen fish products and the handling of shellfish. In 1953, the Torry freshness scale for assessment of fish was developed at the research station. 1965 saw responsibility for Torry transfer from DSIR to the Ministry of Technology. When the Ministry ceased to exist in 1970 Torry transferred to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Another transfer of responsibility occurred in 1972 when Torry moved from DTI to MAFF. Finally, in 1990, Torry Research Station was transferred to the Food Safety Directorate within MAFF working alongside Norwich Food Science Laboratory. =Norwich Food Science Laboratory= In the early 20th Century, war forced the UK Government into strategic planning on avoiding food shortages. Throughout the UK emergency stockpiles of food were gathered in secret locations known as 'Buffer Depots'. The Food Science Laboratory was set up in Great Westminster House - one of the main London headquarters of the then Ministry of Food - with a team of scientists responsible for checking the specifications of the foodstuffs entering the stockpiles (e.g. ensuring that the protein content of the flour was high enough for bread making purposes), and monitoring the quality of existing stocks by looking for signs of deterioration during storage. In 1977 the laboratory moved from Great Westminster House, across the road to Romney Street. The new laboratory was located on the 7th floor of the building occupied by the Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court, where it remained until the end of January 1990, before moving to the new purpose built laboratory in Colney Lane, Norwich. In addition to the London site, the Ministry had an outstation in Norwich, which also monitored the quality of the stockpiles and undertook research into the reactions of food additives. The laboratories - although separate - all operated within the Ministry's Food Standards, Science and Safety Division. The Norwich Laboratory was originally based at Bishopgate in the city but in the late 1960s moved into leased laboratories in the Institute of Food Research (IFR) buildings at Colney Lane on the outskirts of the city. In 1978 re-organisation at IFR led to most of the laboratory's staff and work being transferred to larger premises at Haldin House in the centre of Norwich. Here, in addition to carrying out research into food additives and contaminants the laboratory began long term work on chloropropanols, dioxins, mycotoxins, migration from packaging, veterinary drug residues, trace elements and food authenticity. The laboratory's role as a skilled rapid response unit came into play when called upon to deal with crises such as contamination of cattle feed with lead, and the chemical adulteration of Austrian wine. In 1990 the Norwich Food Science Laboratory returned to Colney Lane where it expanded links with neighbouring institutes (IFR, British Sugar Technical Centre, the John Innes Research Centre and the University of East Anglia) in the formation of the Norwich Research Park. In 1999 the Norwich Food Science Laboratory moved to become part of CSL on the Sand Hutton site. =The National Bee Unit, Luddington= The first Government involvement into the beekeeping industry was in the 1940s when the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF) regulated the provision of sugar to beekeepers under wartime rationing. The first legislation applied to beekeeping was the Foul Brood Disease of Bees Order, 1942. Since then there have been several changes in legislation; the current UK law on bees is administered under the Bees Act 1980, the Bee Disease Control Order 1992 and the Importation of bees Order 1997 as well as being governed by European law. In the 1950s the National Agricultural Advisory Service (NAAS) was responsible for bee health work. Based at Rothamsted Lodge, Harpenden, Hertfordshire, and Trawscoed in Wales, the primary remit of the bee units was disease monitoring and control of bee diseases. In 1979 the units were amalgamated to form the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) National Bee Unit (NBU), located at Luddington Experimental Horticulture Station, just outside Stratford-upon- Avon. The ADAS NBU provided statutory and advisory services to MAFF and beekeepers throughout England and Wales on all aspects of apiary management and bee health as well as carrying out R&D; work. In 1991, following the privatisation of ADAS, the NBU joined CSL and in 1994 took on the responsibility of the MAFF Bee Disease Inspection Service. History - timeline Key dates on the timeline to the formation of CSL: =1988= The Harpenden Laboratory and the Pest Infestation Control Laboratory, both operating within the Agricultural Science Service of the Agricultural and Development Advisory Service (ADAS) - a division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) - come together under single management. Forerunners of CSL, the laboratories share common scientific objectives in relation to the safe and efficient production of food and the protection of the consumer and the environment. Central Science Laboratory is officially launched still operating within ADAS. =1991= One outcome of the Government's 'Next Steps Initiative' is the decision to privatise the advisory service of ADAS along with its research activities. CSL is identified as a candidate for Executive Agency status of MAFF and at this stage separates from ADAS. The National Bee Unit (one of the advisory services of ADAS) joins CSL. =1992= Official launch of CSL as an Executive Agency of MAFF. Re-launch of CSL as an enlarged Executive Agency following merger with MAFF's Food Science Laboratories based at Norwich and Torry, Aberdeen. =1996= CSL relocates to Sand Hutton, with the exception of field stations in Gloucestershire and Hampshire and the food safety work undertaken at Norwich. =1998= Remaining staff and work at Norwich relocate to York. =2001= MAFF is disbanded. CSL becomes an Executive Agency of Defra. Time line of formation of the Central Science Laboratory =2009= On 1 April 2009 Central Science Laboratory merged with Defra's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate, Plant Varieties and Seeds, Defra Plant Health Division and the Government Decontamination Service to form The Food and Environment Research Agency, an Executive Agency of Defra.

The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas) is an executive agency of the United Kingdom government Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It carries out a wide range of research, advisory, consultancy, monitoring and training activities for a large number of customers around the world. Cefas employs over 550 staff based primarily at two specialist laboratories within the UK, with additional staff based at small, port-based offices in Scarborough, Hayle and Plymouth. In 2014 Cefas established a permanent base in the Middle East by opening an office in Kuwait, and since opened an office in Oman. They also operate an ocean-going research vessel Cefas Endeavour. Customers The primary customer for Cefas is their parent organisation Defra. They also undertake work for international and UK government departments (central and local), the World Bank, the European Commission, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), commercial organisations, non-governmental and environmental organisations, regulators and enforcement agencies, local authorities and other public bodies. There is an increasing focus on commercial research and consultancy as the level of funding available from Defra gradually reduces. History Known previously as the Directorate of Fisheries Research, the name and status was changed in 1997 to 'Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science' (Cefas). At this time it became an Executive Agency of what was then the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom) and is now the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). =Lowestoft laboratory= Cefas Endeavour moored in the Inner Harbour, Lowestoft In 1902, the Marine Biological Association opened a sub-station in Pakefield a suburb of Lowestoft, Suffolk to research the Fishing industry. This was part of the UK contribution to the newly created International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). By 1921 the station had been expanded to include a laboratory with experimental facilities. Early research was focused on aspects of the marine biology of the North Sea. During the 20s and 30s biological studies expanded, the theory of fishing was developed and forecasting fish stocks became routine. In 1927‚Äì1928 Michael Graham was dispatched from the Lowestoft laboratory by the Colonial Office and conducted the first ever systematic Fisheries Survey of Lake Victoria.Graham M. (1929.) The Victoria Nyanza and Its Fisheries: A Report on the Fish Survey of Lake Victoria 1927‚Äì1928 and Appendices. London: Crown Agents for the Colonies. 256pp. After the second world war, radiobiological facilities were installed to advise on the safe disposal of radioactive substances at sea. Research aboard the newly acquired Arctic-going Research Vessel Ernest Holt established an important link between fishable cod concentrations and water temperatures and identified cod migration routes. The migration routes of plaice stocks were identified and the deterioration in the North Sea herring fishery was investigated. From this ground-breaking work came theories of fishing and fish population trends that have become international recognised. The laboratory moved to its current site on the cliffs in the Kirkley area 1955. The site was expanded in the 60s and 80s to meet the needs of emerging work programmes monitoring the quality of the marine environment. Although the period 1964‚Äì1982 probably saw the fullest flowering of fisheries research, per se, at Lowestoft, the increasing awareness of both politicians and the public about the importance of maintaining the quality of the marine environment, meant that an increasing proportion of the work programme of that period was devoted to problems associated with investigating both radioactive and non-radioactive contamination at sea. =Conwy laboratory= Research at Conwy started in 1918 to find a more effective method of mussel purification. The Conway Corporation mussel purification tanks were taken over by the then Board of Agriculture and Fisheries and research. Research expanded into developing hatchery culture techniques, initially on the native oyster, and subsequently, in the 1960s, on the Pacific oyster, work which now forms the basis of the UK bivalve cultivation industry. The laboratory was expanded in the 70s in order to increase the capacity to research other aspects of shellfish cultivation. This included responsibilities for dealing with ecological and management problems in various shellfisheries. More recent research shifted emphasis away from shellfish cultivation to the ecology of coastal waters and coastal zone management. This work was transferred to the Weymouth laboratory when the Conwy facilities were closed in 2000. =Weymouth laboratory= Cefas, Weymouth The Weymouth laboratory was established in 1969 with four staff, specifically to study the cause of a disease in salmon. The laboratory was expanded in the 1970s and 1980s to investigate serious disease risks threatening the expanding fish farming industry. During the 1980s research shifted towards determining drug residues in fish for human consumption and environmental problems associated with release of medicines from fish farms. Further expansion occurred during the 90s from new inspection and monitoring responsibilities stemming from EC directives. These dealt with marine and freshwater fish health, and microbiological hygiene of molluscan shellfish. This resulted in the existing facilities becoming over stretched. In 1994 a new laboratory, housing state-of the art equipment and the most modern facilities, was opened. The Weymouth Laboratory is the base for the Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI). FHI's primary role is undertake statutory and inspection duties resulting from the EU Fish Health regime and other national legislation in the area of fish and shellfish health. The Inspectorate also licenses and monitors imports of fish and shellfish from other countries and runs an enforcement programme aimed at preventing the illegal importation of these animals. Weymouth Laboratory is also the European Union and UK national reference laboratory for monitoring bacteriological and viral contamination of bivalve molluscs. =Burnham-on-Crouch laboratory= The Burnham laboratory was established in 1953 as the Ministry's first-ever purpose-built fisheries laboratory. The role of the laboratory was expanded in 1957 to cover work on pollution, and by the mid-60s began to take the lead in the investigation of environmental protection problems, with the exception of those arising from radioactive waste. Early studies concentrated on determining the toxic effects of various contaminants and surveying their levels in coastal waters and inshore fisheries. By 1970, the general aim of the work had become the establishing of the effects on commercial fish and shellfish resources of disposal of wastes, mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, and engineering and development work. This involved environmental impact assessments and a major monitoring programme. The Burnham Laboratory hosts the UK Offshore Chemical Notification Scheme which manages chemical use and discharge by the UK offshore petroleum industry. The scheme is regulated by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC), using scientific and environmental advice from Cefas and the Fisheries Research Services (FRS). The laboratory was closed in December 2008 and the work moved to the Lowestoft Laboratory. =Ships= Ships that have been operated by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science: * RV Huxley (1902‚Äì1909) * SY Hildegarde and SY Hiawatha (1912‚Äì1914) * SS Joseph & Sarah Miles (1920‚Äì1922) * RV George Bligh (1921‚Äì1939) * RV Onaway (1930‚Äì1960) * RV Platessa (1946‚Äì1967) * RV Ernest Holt (1946‚Äì1971) * RV Sir Lancelot (1947‚Äì1960) * RV Tellina (1960‚Äì1981) * RV Clione (1961‚Äì1988) * RV Corella (1967‚Äì1983) * RV Cirolana (1970‚Äì2003) * RV Corystes (1988‚Äì2003) * RV Cefas Endeavour (2003‚Äìpresent) =Notable alumni= *John Shepherd FRS, Deputy Director of the fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft, specialising in the marine disposal of radioactive waste, mathematical modelling of fishing fleet operations, and fish population dynamics.

Biography He was born on April 16, 1909 in Berlin, Germany or Budapest, Hungary to Margaret Willinger, also a photographer.His Associated Press and Los Angeles Times obituary says that he was born in Budapest, Hungary but all the documents he signed for his naturalization, state under oath, that he was born in Berlin, Germany. Willinger established photographic studios in Paris and Berlin in 1929 and 1931 respectively, and at the same time submitted his photographs to various newspapers as a freelance contributor. He left Berlin in 1933 when Adolf Hitler became chancellor, settling and working in Vienna, where he began to photograph such celebrities as Marlene Dietrich, Hedy Lamarr, Pietro Mascagni, Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, and Max Reinhardt. By the mid-1930s he was travelling through Africa and Asia before being invited by studio photographer Eugene Robert Richee to move to the United States. He crossed into the United States at Mexicali, Mexico on December 20, 1937 and resided in Los Angeles, California. After establishing a studio in Hollywood, California, Willinger became a frequent contributor to magazines and periodicals, providing magazine cover portraits of some of the most popular stars. Willinger was one of the first Hollywood photographers to experiment in the use of color. In later years, shortly before his death, Willinger was accused of stalking some celebrities of the time, including Charlie Chaplin. An investigation into the matter led to the uncovering of thousands of personal pictures of the male comedy star. Willinger died of heart failure on August 8, 1989 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.

Airport facilities The terminal at Chilliwack seen from airside The airport is used by private pilots and by commercial air operators. Servicing and modification facilities are available for single and twin engined aircraft. Chilliwack Flight Fest Every year in the last week of August the airport hosts an event known as the Chilliwack Flight Fest, a free air show for everyone to watch. The show is popular with families, and aviation enthusiasts are welcome to fly their own aircraft. Airport restaurant The Airport Coffee Shop at the Chilliwack airport operated sporadically from the opening of the airport until it was purchased in the 1970s by Neil and Kathleen McNeill. As a recent retiree from the Canadian Forces as an army chef, he enticed pilots to land with freshly cooked meals. Pilots could radio ahead before landing and order a meal, similar to truck stop cafes of that era. The McNeills sold the Airport Coffee Shop in 1975, and the airport and the Airport Coffee Shop have torn down soon afterward, replaced with a fully modern Airport. After remaining closed for several years, Barbara and Gordon Mitchell purchased the Airport Coffee Shop in 1980. Focusing on fresh homemade pies, roast turkey, and hamburgers, Barb and Gord became well known among pilots throughout Canada for their pies and cinnamon buns. COPA granted an honorary pair of pilot's wings to Barb in 1994 for her pies and \\"Food for Flying Folk\\". Barb continued to operate the Airport Coffee Shop with Gord, eventually opening a second restaurant called Devan's Restaurant. Devan's closed in the late 90s after Gord's death, but Barb continued to operate the Airport Coffee Shop along with her son, Jon, until 2008. After 28 years in the restaurant industry, Barb retired and sold the business to long-time employee Judi Good. Judi worked for Barb and Gord for 13 years prior to buying the restaurant with her two sisters, Jacqueline and Tracey. In 2017 the cooks that have been cooking with the same recipes and baking wonderful pies are now running the business with a large and wonderful new patio overlooking the airport and the mountain vista. The Airport Restaurant & Patio continues to be well known among pilots and Chilliwack residents for its food, especially its pies and hamburgers. After periods of sporadic activity, the restaurant has now been in continuous operation for over 32 years.

Brearley was a fast bowler with what Wisden described as \\"a rolling gait\\" who put his full ‚Äì and substantial ‚Äì weight into achieving pace and swing. He played county cricket only from the age of 26, but his abity to make the ball rise sharply on the somewhat fiery Old Trafford wickets became noticed the following year, but after the wickets became less difficult he was dropped from the side. The following year, his bowling was a valuable part of Lancashire's finest season in county cricket (sixteen wins and no losses) but his inability to play late in the season attracted the notice of Wisden. The following year, he improved even further ‚Äì at times bowling well even on wickets too dead to suit a fast bowler. A superb display of pace and length against Somerset at Old Trafford made him an automatic choice for the Test team for the Fourth Test against Australia. He took four wickets in each innings, and in the final match of the series at The Oval took six out of the 14 wickets to fall, including five for 110 runs in the first innings. In all cricket that season, he took the wicket of Victor Trumper six times and finished with an aggregate of 181 wickets for 19.25 each. His tremendous stamina and ability to maintain his fastest pace through even the longest spells of bowling was described as \\"nothing short of remarkable\\" by the 1906 Wisden. However, having established himself as the best fast bowler in the world, at the end of the season Brearley announced that business claims would prevent him playing again. Although he changed his mind and did play five times for Lancashire in 1906 besides helping Neville Knox to form a remarkably hostile attack for the Gentlemen at Lord's, he refused to play again for his county until 1908. In 1907, Brearley only played a handful of first-class games for the Gentlemen and a couple of privately raised teams, but was still thought good enough to only just miss out on a Test place at Lord's against South Africa. 1908 saw Brearley end his dispute with the Lancashire committee and bowl superbly before business kept him out of most of the August matches. He took 148 wickets in just seventeen matches and was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden. In 1909 he was even more impressive so long as he could play, but failed in his only Test, and in the following two years business and a major accident limited him to just fourteen of Lancashire's fifty eight Championship games. The following year, Brearley's rift with the Lancashire committee became irreconcilable and at the beginning of 1912 it was clear he would play no county cricket. However, so well-thought of was he that, playing when business allowed for Cheshire in the Minor Counties competition, Brearley played one further Test but the wicket was too soft for him to get a foothold. Even when the best fast bowler in the world, Brearley could never go on an overseas tour owing to business commitments. Brearley made one late first-class appearance in 1921 at the age of 45 when he was picked for Archie MacLaren's amateur team that took on, and beat, Warwick Armstrong's previously invincible Australians. Brearley's own contribution was modest: he scored one run and did not bowl. A wholehearted cricketer who bustled about whatever he did, Brearley's batting fame rested on his hurried walk to the wicket and the much-told Old Trafford story that, at the sound of him scurrying to the wicket, the horse walked between the shafts of the heavy roller ready for the end of the innings. In all cricket, he took 844 wickets but scored only 908 runs. Neville Cardus wrote \\"Every ball was a crisis as far as Brealey was concerned\\". Brearley maintained faith in his ability long after his retirement. When watching new fast bowlers in later years Brearley was often heard to exclaim that he could still 'throw his hat faster'.

Early life Abhayavardhana was born in Kandy where his maternal grandfather was an Anglican vicar - at a time when the Church of England was the established church. His father was a government servant and a pillar of the establishment. Abhayavardhana was educated at St Thomas' College, Mt. Lavinia. His upbringing, being anglicised in culture and religion, was typical of the colonial middle-class and hence remote from the mass of Sinhala- speaking Buddhist people. He and his fellow matriculation student were once posed the question 'Would you have been better off under your own king?' by their teacher, in response to which he began to ponder upon nationalism and British colonial rule. At fifteen he renounced Christianity and became an atheist. In 1936 he joined University College, Colombo where he read liberal arts and came under the influence of E.F.C. Ludowyk and Doric de Souza, who had Marxist sympathies. He went on to complete his colonial education at the Colombo Law College. Abhayavardhana's first exposure to radical politics was the Bracegirdle incident, in which the Colonial Government sought to deport an Australian labour activist. He attended a mass meeting at Galle Face Green on 5 May 1937 at Bracegirdle made a dramatic appearance and a stirring speech before being whisked away into hiding. At the time, his father was the Chief Clerk in the office of Governor Reginald Stubbs, who sought the deportation and against whom this meeting was directed. He organised the Mount Lavinia Debating Society, which invited such speakers as Dr. Colvin R. de Silva and J. R. Jayewardene. Revolutionary Abhayavardhana was recruited to the Lanka Sama Samaja Party in 1940 by Esmond Wickremesinghe (later to be father of Ranil Wickremasinghe). He became part of the clandestine section of the LSSP that was established, in anticipation of its proscription, to work underground. After the party leaders were imprisoned and escaped to India he joined them in exile there (disguised as an Anglican priest) and worked in the Independence movement. He became a member of the Bolshevik-Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI) and began his career as a writer. His two pamphlets 'The Saboteur Strategy of the Constructive Programme' and on the Quit India Movement of the Congress Party were considered to be seminal theoretical works. When the main LSSP leaders returned to Sri Lanka after the war, Abhayawardhana was among the Sama Samajists who remained in India. =Journalist= He worked on the fortnightly New Spark in Bombay, later moving to Chennai. He became General Secretary of the Socialist Party which was created by the fusion in 1948 of the BLPI with the Congress Socialist Party. He moved to New Delhi where he was editor of the Socialist Appeal and contributor to the Hindustan Standard. He spent two years in Hyderabad editing Mankind before returning to New Delhi where he began the critical journal Maral. Return to Sri Lanka In 1959 Abhayavardhana married Kusala Fernando and returned to Sri Lanka in 1960. Abhayavardhana is credited with formulating the classification of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as a petty bourgeois party, which was the ideological and theoretical foundation of the LSSP Coalition with that party in 1964. After this, he promoted an alliance with the SLFP and the Communist Party, which finally emerged with the signing of the Common Programme of the United Front in 1968. Abhayavardhana started The Nation as an English organ of the United Front, serving as its editor. When the United Front formed a government in 1970 Hector served as Chairman of the People's Bank under Dr. N.M. Perera, the Finance Minister. After the front broke up in 1975, he founded the Socialist Nation. He also served on the Educational Bureau of the LSSP and was a long-standing member of the Politburo. In August 1992 Abhayavardhana, along with Vivienne Goonewardena and Bernard Soysa was a guest of honour at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Quit India movement in New Delhi.

It is his first collection containing newly written songs since his 1996 album Sutras. Beat Cafe was released worldwide (Appleseed Records 1081) on August 24, 2004. The first 1000 CDs were autographed and hand numbered. History After the launching of his website and three new releases within two years, Donovan entered the studio with a new band including his longtime friends Danny Thompson on bass and Jim Keltner on drums. The new sessions, produced by John Chelew, mixed rock and roll with a beatnik style. In addition to handling production duties, Chelew contributed keyboards to many of the songs on the finished album. While many of the songs were new compositions, Donovan also revamped a few older compositions. Among these songs are \\"Poorman's Sunshine\\", originally titled \\"Poor Man's Sunshine (Nativity)\\", and \\"Lord of the Universe\\". Both originated during the Barabajagal sessions. \\"Lover O Lover\\" was originally released on Love Is Only Feeling in 1983.  Public Perception  Beat Cafe was positively welcomed by music critics.

Construction was completed and the line began operation on December 19, 1854. In 1871, under the order of the company's president Martin Howell, the M&NB; signed a 999-year lease with the United Jersey Railroad Company, which would later become part of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) known as the \\"Millstone Branch.\\" In 1915, the company was dissolved and became part of the United Jersey Railroad Company.prrths.com  History  = Intended connection westward = Share of the Millstone & New-Brunswick Railroad Co. from February 20, 1883 The M&NB; was originally intended to cross the Millstone River and connect to western points in 1874 via the ill-fated Mercer & Somerset Railway (M&S;), a short- lived line of PRR in western New Jersey. M&S; ran from Somerset Junction on the Belvidere Delaware Rail Road via Pennington and Hopewell to Millstone, with an intended connection to the Millstone & New Brunswick Railroad, via a bridge across the Millstone River, for a through route to New Brunswick. M&S; was abandoned in 1880 after filing for bankruptcy, and the connection over the Millstone River to M&NB; was never built, except for a stone pillar in the middle of the Millstone River that remains today. = Passenger service = The Millstone Branch boasted 12 daily passenger trains East Millstone to New York City. Passenger stations, which consisted of small wooden shacks, were located at East Millstone, South Middlebush Road, Clyde Road, Voorhees (now Route 27), and Jersey Avenue. Passenger service permitted Millstone residents easy access to New Brunswick for shopping on weekends and allowed New York City businessmen the opportunity to commute. With the advent of the automobile, all passenger service ended in 1930. After that year the track past Route 27 (Voorhees) was used sporadically by a local freight train to access the rubber factory in East Millstone; track became weed-covered and maintenance deferred. The stations at Clyde and Voorhees were abandoned on June 8, 1932. The last passenger station to survive was Middlebush, which was razed in 1948. = 1960s to the 1980s = The Jersey Avenue Park & Ride station operated by NJ Transit (NJT) opened October 24, 1963 by the Pennsylvania Railroad and uses part of the old branch. In an effort to cut costs, PRR merged with the New York Central Railroad to form the Penn Central Transportation Corporation (PC) in 1968. The Millstone Branch remained intact and active as far east as East Millstone to a rubber reclaiming facility located at the end of the branch until 1972 when the branch west of Clyde Road was abandoned. PC wanted to abandon the line but was required by federal law to serve any customers who wanted rail service regardless of profitability. During the first six months of 1972, PC delivered only six carloads to the rubber factory, earning $1,383 in revenue; the cost to PC for making those deliveries was $3,862. PC filed for bankruptcy in 1970, and sold all railroad assets to the new government-created Conrail (CR) on April 1, 1976. PC only sold the portion of the Millstone Branch up to South Middlebush Road to CR while retaining ownership of the South Middlebush Road‚ÄìEast Millstone section. In 1971 several warehouses were built along Clyde Road, three of which had rail spurs installed and connected to the line. However, only Hermann Warehouse Corporation utilized rail. One of the rail spurs has since been removed, never having been used. Trackage west of Clyde Road to the East Millstone terminus was abandoned and removed in summer 1980 (a small section of track remains buried in brush William and Market Streets in East Millstone). Motorists complained that the poorly maintained grade crossing near Colonial Park was causing damage to their cars. By this time, there were no active customers past the Route 27 crossing; the branch fell into disrepair and became overgrown with vegetation. For the next 30 years, the line west of Route 27 remained active to provide service to Hermann Warehouse Corp. CR upgrade the remaining infrastructure, replacing ties, switches, and brush. New ballast was also laid. Millstone Branch at Clyde Road in April 2011, after track rehabilitation = Present conditions = After branching off Amtrak's Northeast Corridor at County Interlocking, the Millstone Branch begins with the use of NJT trains terminating at the Jersey Avenue station. Just east of South Middlebush Road the track is removed, but the right-of-way all the way to East Millstone is discernible. This includes Railroad Avenue (absent the former railroad tracks) that is still a street in the Middlebush section of Franklin Township. In 2001 three luxury homes on the outskirts of East Millstone were built on top of the right-of-way that borders Colonial Park. In 2006 a new housing development was built east of South Middlebush Road; backyards and driveways of several houses were constructed on top of the former roadbed. The bridge pillar in the middle of the Millstone River which was intended to carry the tracks to the M&S; still stands. The engine house and wye track in East Millstone are now a grass field. What remains of the Millstone Branch is currently owned and served by Norfolk Southern Railway. Service is provided by the \\"Metuchen local\\" that works the branch late at night (12am-2am) a few times per week. The branch is now referred to as the \\"Millstone Secondary\\" in the Amtrak, NJT, and NS timetables. As of 2011, Hermann Warehouse Corp re-located out of the Clyde Road facility and there has not been rail service into that building since then. The Millstone Branch past Route 27 is again out of service. Track conditions have significantly deteriorated with the rails being engulfed with vegetation.

History  The monastery was founded in 1089 at the time of the Investiture Controversy by Counts Gero and Kuno of Achalm, advised by Bishop Adalbero of W√ºrzburg and Abbot William of Hirsau. The first monks were also from Hirsau Abbey, home of the Hirsau Reforms (under the influence of the Cluniac reforms), which strongly influenced the new foundation. Noker von Zwiefalten was the first abbot and led from 1065‚Äì90. The monk Ortlieb wrote a history of the monastery in the early 12th century. Berthold continued it to 1137‚Äì38. He served as abbot in 1139‚Äì1141, 1146/7‚Äì1152/6 and 1158‚Äì1169. During the 12th century Saint Ernest (died 1148) was abbot. Between 1145 and 1149 he participated in the Second Crusade to regain the Holy Lands including Jerusalem. Although Pope Urban VI granted special privileges to it, Zwiefalten Abbey was nevertheless the private monastery of the Counts of Achalm, later succeeded by the Counts of W√ºrttemberg. The abbey was plundered in 1525 during the German Peasants' War. Christoph Rassler was abbot from 1658‚Äì75 and Augustin Stegm√ºller was abbot in the 18th century. In 1750 the abbey was granted the status of Reichsabtei, which meant that it had the status of an independent power subject only to the Imperial Crown and was free of the rule of W√ºrttemberg. On 25 November 1802, however, it was secularised and dissolved and became a lunatic asylum and later psychiatric hospital, which it is today, as well as the site of the W√ºrttemberg Psychiatry Museum.  Buildings  The present buildings were constructed in German Baroque style from 1739‚Äì47 under the direction of Johann Michael Fischer (1692‚Äì1766) of Munich, who began overseeing the work in 1741. The interior, considered a model of Baroque design, is filled with ornate chapels and gilded balustrades, dominated by the high altar, which combines a Gothic statue of the Virgin Mary dating from 1430 with Baroque additions (dating from about 1750) by Johann Joseph Christian (1706‚Äì77). The elaborate frescoes are by Franz Joseph Spiegler (1691‚Äì1757).Germany: A Phaidon Cultural Guide, pp. 775-6. Oxford: Phaidon, 1985.

It is located in the Hirsau borough of Calw on the northern slopes of the Black Forest mountain range, in the present-day state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. In the 11th and 12th century, the monastery was a centre of the Cluniac Reforms, implemented as \\"Hirsau Reforms\\" in the German lands. The complex was devastated during the War of the Palatine Succession in 1692 and not rebuilt. History =St Aurelius= A Christian chapel at Hirsau dedicated to Saint Nazarius had already been erected in the late 8th century. The monastery itself was founded in about 830 by the Rhenish Franconian count Erlafried of Calw at the instigation of his relative, Bishop Notting of Vercelli, who gave it the relics of Saint Aurelius of Riditio, an Armenian bishop who had died about 475, brought from Milan among other treasures; they were first placed in the oratory of St. Nazarius' Chapel, while the monastery at Hirsau was being built on the count's estates. It was settled by a colony of fifteen monks descending from Fulda Abbey, disciples of Rabanus Maurus and Walafrid Strabo, under one abbot Liudebert or Lutpert. Count Erlafried endowed the new foundation with extended lands and other gifts, and made a solemn donation of the whole into the hands of Lutpert, on condition that the Rule of Saint Benedict should be observed. A first aisleless church, dedicated to Saint Aurelius, was not completed until 838, when it was consecrated by Archbishop Odgar of Mainz, who at the same time translated the relics from their temporary resting place to the new church. Belltower Abbot Lutpert died in 853, having brought about a substantial increase both in the possessions of the abbey and in the number of the monks under his rule. Regular observance flourished under him and his successors and a successful monastic school was established. Over about a hundred and fifty years, under the care of the Counts of Calw, it enjoyed great prosperity, and became an important seat of learning. However, towards the end of the 10th century the ravages of pestilence, combined with the greed of its patrons and the laxity of the community, brought it to ruin. In 988 a severe plague devastated the neighbourhood and carried off sixty of the monks including the abbot, Hartfried. Only a dozen were left to elect a successor, and they divided into two parties. The more fervent chose one Conrad, whose election was confirmed by the Bishop of Speyer, but some of the others, who favoured a more relaxed rule, elected an opposition abbot in the person of Eberhard, the cellarer. For some time the dispute ran high between the rival superiors and their respective followers. The Count of Calw supported the claims of Eberhard, but neither party would give way to the other and in the end the count brought in an armed force to settle the quarrel. The result was that the abbey was pillaged, the monks dispersed, and the valuable library destroyed. The count became master of the property and the abbey remained empty for over sixty years, during which time the buildings fell into a ruinous state. In 1049 Pope Leo IX, uncle of Count Adalbert of Calw and grandson of the spoliator, came to Hirschau, and required Adalbert to restore the abbey. The count had the abbey church rebuilt in the style of a Roman basilica with an attached cloister: He renovated the premises, but so slowly that they were not refurbished until 1065, when the monastery was resettled by a dozen monks from the renowned Einsiedeln Abbey in Swabia, with Abbot Frederick at their head. =Sts Peter and Paul= The Hirsch (deer) on the abbey's coat of arms It was however Frederick's successor who revived and even surpassed the former renown and prosperity of the abbey. This was the famous William of Hirsau, a monk descending from St. Emmeram's Abbey in the Bavarian capital Regensburg, who was appointed abbot in 1069. When he came the condition of the monastery was far from satisfactory. The monks were living in cramped conditions, as the buildings were still incomplete and furthermore repeatedly affected by floods of the Nagold river. Count Adalbert still retained possession of some of the monastic property, together with a certain amount of unhelpful influence over the community, and regular discipline was very much relaxed. Abbot William's zeal and prudence by degrees remedied this unsatisfactory state of affairs and inaugurated a period of great prosperity, both spiritual and temporal. During the Investiture Controversy that shook the Holy Roman Empire, he secured the independence of the abbey from the Counts of Calw and placed its finances on a sound footing. William completed the buildings already begun and from 1082 afterwards greatly added to them, as the needs of the increasing community required, a new monastery complex on a high plateau on the opposite side of the Nagold river. The Sts Peter and Paul's abbey church, which was modelled on Cluny II finished about 981 under Abbot Majolus, was consecrated in 1091. The convent followed the next year, when it moved into the adjacent new monastic compound designed according to the Plan of Saint Gall, while old St Aurelius was converted into a priory. William also refounded the monastic school for which the abbey had formerly been famous throughout Germany. But the abbot's greatest work, perhaps, and that for which his name is best remembered, was the reformation that he effected within the community itself. Cluny was then at the height of its fame and William sent some of his monks there to learn the Cluniac customs and rule, after which the Cluniac discipline was introduced at Hirsau. By his Constitutiones Hirsaugienses, a new religious order, the Ordo Hirsaugiensis, was formed. Known as the Hirsau Reforms, the adoption of this rule revitalised Benedictine monasteries throughout Germany, such as those of Zwiefalten, Blaubeuren Petershausen, Saint Peter and Saint George in the Black Forest in Swabia, as well as the Thuringian monastery of Reinhardsbrunn, Franconian Comburg and St. Paul's Abbey in the Lavanttal in Carinthia. Hirsau priories were located at Reichenbach and Sch√∂nrain, in Bavarian Fischbachau and Thuringian Paulinzella. A friend and correspondent of Pope Gregory VII and Archbishop Anselm of Canterbury, William took active part in the politico-ecclesiastical controversies of his time. He was also author of inter alia the treatise De musica et tonis, as well as the Philosophicarum et astronomicarism institutionuin libri iii. The abbot then wrote his well-known \\"Consuetudines Hirsaugienses\\"P. L., CL, and Herrgott, \\"Vetus Disciplina Monastica\\", which for several centuries remained the standard of monastic observance. Under William monks were sent out from Hirsau to reform other German monasteries on the same lines, and from it seven new monasteries were founded. The numbers of the community increased to 150 under his rule, manual labour and the copying of manuscripts forming an important part of their occupations. Numerous exemptions and other privileges were obtained from time to time from emperors and popes. In the twelfth century the autocratic rule of Abbot Manegold caused for a time some internal dissensions and a consequent decline of strict discipline, but the vigorous efforts of several abbots checked the decadence, and temporarily re-established the stricter observance. About the end of the 12th century Hirsau Abbey was again very perceptibly on the decline both materially and morally. It never afterwards again rose into importance. In the fifteenth century, however, the famous \\"Customs\\" gradually became little more than a dead letter. Wolfram, the thirty-eighth abbot (1428‚Äì1460), introduced the contemporary Melk Reform. A few years later Hirsau adopted the Constitutions of Bursfelde Abbey and became part of the Bursfelde Congregation. Wolfram's successor, Bernhard, carried on the work of revival, freed the abbey from its debts, restored the monastic buildings, and also reformed several other monasteries. In the days of Abbot John III (1514‚Äì1556) Hirsau fell on hard times: the Protestant Reformation began to make its influence felt, and after a brief period of struggle, the abbey, through the involvement of Duke Ulrich of W√ºrttemberg, passed into Lutheran hands, though still maintaining its monastic character. In consequence of the Reformation it was secularized in 1558. In 1630 it became Catholic again for a short time, but after the Peace of Westphalia (1648) it once more came under the control of the Dukes of W√ºrttemberg and another series of Lutheran abbots presided over it. The community eventually came to an end and the once famous Hirsau Abbey was finally destroyed during the Nine Years' War by French troops under General Lieutenant M√©lac in 1692. Only the ruins now remain to mark its site.

EkaggatƒÅ is identified within the Buddhist teachings as: * One of the seven universal mental factors within the Theravada abhidharma teachings. * One of the qualities associated with the second dhyƒÅna, according to the Pali Canon.Henepola Gunaratana, The Path of Serenity and Insight: An Explanation of the Buddhist JhƒÅnas, p.87Roderick S. Bucknell (1993), Reinterpreting the Jhanas. p.375 * Antidote to sensory desire (kƒÅmacchanda) within the five hindrances. Etymology EkaggatƒÅ (Pali) (Sanskrit EkƒÅgratƒÅ, ‡§è‡§ï‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§æ) means \\"one-pointedness\\", or the state (-tƒÅ) of having one (eka) point (agga or agra). Definition Theravada monk Bhikkhu Bodhi states: :This is the unification of the mind on its object. Although this factor comes to prominence in the jhƒÅnas, where it functions as a jhƒÅna factor, the Abhidhamma teaches that the germ of that capacity for mental unification is present in all types of consciousness, even the most rudimentary. It there functions as the factor which fixes the mind on its object. One-pointedness has non-wandering or non-distraction as its characteristic. Its function is to conglomerate or unite the associated states. Bhikkhu Bodhi also notes that deeper, more profound concentration (versus the subtle) concentration causes peace. This is thought to arise from and is founded in happiness. Nina van Gorkom explains: :EkaggatƒÅ, part of mental factors, allows one refine the focus and to settle onto single object. This refinement occurs by separating senses into the 6 groups of auditory, visual, olfactory, kinesthetic, thought and metaphysical aspects of perception. The AtthasƒÅlinƒ´ (1, Part IV, Chapter 1. 118, 119) eleborates ekaggatƒÅ (in the context of sammƒÅ-samƒÅdhi): : This concentration, known as one-pointedness of mind, has non-scattering (of itself) or non-distraction (of associated states) as characteristic, the welding together of the coexistent states as function, as water kneads bath-powder into a paste, and peace of mind or knowledge as manifestation. For it has been said: 'He who is concentrated knows, sees according to the truth.' It is distinguished by having ease (sukha) (usually) as a proximate cause. Like the steadiness of a lamp in the absence of wind, so should steadfastness of mind be understood.Gorkom (2010), Definition of ekaggata Ajahn Sucitto further explains: : This is the factor of absorption that arises dependent on bringing to mind, non-involvement and evaluation. It occurs in meditation when the quality of ease has calmed rapture and the mental energy; the energy of focusing and the bodily energy are in harmony. The resultant merging of mind and body is experienced as a firmness in awareness, which is hence not penetrated by sense-impressions.Ajahn Sucitto (2011). Meditation, A Way of Awakening.

Larger towns with commissioners were converted to urban districts by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, with the smaller commissions continuing to exist beyond partition in 1922. The idea was a standardisation of the improvement commissioners established in an ad- hoc manner for particular towns in Britain and Ireland in the eighteenth century. The last town commissioners in Northern Ireland were abolished in 1962, while in the Republic of Ireland the remaining commissions were renamed as town councils in 2002, and abolished and replaced with municipal districts by the Local Government Reform Act 2014. Lighting of Towns Act, 1828 The first town commissioners were established by the Lighting of Towns (Ireland) Act, 1828 (9 Geo. IV c.82). This was \\"adoptive\\" legislation, which ratepayers in a borough or market town could choose to enact in their community. As the existing borough corporations were ineffective as local authorities the act came into force in sixty-five towns. William Neilson Hancock explained the act in 1877 thus: :The first clause repealed a number of Acts of Parliament, those of 1765, 1773, 1785, and 1796. Those were all temporary Acts of the Irish Parliament, and the British Parliament in 1807 renewed all of them for 21 years, and that renewal came to expire in the year 1828. It was then renewed for one year for that Session of Parliament to allow legislation to take place. Those Acts are all founded upon the vestry system of management of towns. Some of the large towns had by local Acts got lighting and other matters under vestries in the parishes, and all those Acts were founded upon the idea of extending the vestry system to the management of towns; but the vestries never made the way in Ireland which they did in England, because there was no poor law. The basis of vestries being so popular in England, being on account of the poor law administration. There was no poor law in Ireland until 1838, and the vestries had no real basis to rest on; and in 1828 they were in a most unpopular position, because the agitation which overthrew them in 1833 by the extinction of what is called parish cess, the same as the church rates in England, was just at its height. 1828 was within five years of the total extinction of Irish church rates, so that they had become quite unpopular and unmanageable bodies. Whereas local acts appointing commissioners for particular places specified a boundary or distance inside which the commissioners' powers would be confined, no such limit was specified in the 1828 act. Thomas Larcom of the Irish Ordnance Survey wrote of the commissioners in 1846: :The boundaries of their assessments are very vaguely defined. Sometimes a mile, or half a mile around the town, or from its centre; sometimes the whole or part of the parish. An attempt was made to survey them for the Ordnance Maps, but they could not be ascertained with sufficient precision. Municipal reform 1840 In 1840 the majority of Irish boroughs were abolished by the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840, and the commissioners established by the 1828 act became the only local council. The town commissioners were recognised as successor to the borough, retaining corporate property and the municipal coat of arms. Any town with property of more than ¬£100 that lost its borough corporation, but had not adopted the 1828 Act, was to establish \\"municipal commissioners\\". There was, in fact, only one town to which this applied: Carrickfergus in County Antrim. Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854 The Towns Improvement (Ireland) Act 1854 (17 & 18 Vict. c.103) allowed electors of populous places to choose to establish town commissioners. This enabled many newer communities that had never had municipal status to gain local government bodies. Many of the towns governed by the 1828 act replaced this with the new legislation as it provided the commissioners with greater powers. Townships established by local acts A number of towns took a different route to establish local authorities in their areas, by having private acts passed in parliament. These acts established \\"townships\\" with defined boundaries, defined the powers of the commissioners, gave them powers to make rates, named the first members and provided a procedure for subsequent elections. The majority of townships were formed in the rapidly growing suburbs of Dublin. To gain further powers or adjust their boundaries the township commissioners had to apply for a further act of parliament. Changes in the 1870s In 1872 the Local Government Board (Ireland) was formed. One of its duties was to consider applications for the formation of commissioners under the 1854 act, and for alteration of the areas of existing local government towns. The board issued annual reports on its activities, detailing the finances and condition of the various municipalities under its control. In 1878 Ireland was divided into sanitary districts, with all commissioners in towns with a population of more than 6000 becoming urban sanitary authorities. The Local Government Board had the power to designate additional towns with commissioners as sanitary districts. =Towns governed under the 1854 Act= There were 76 such towns in 1881: *Arklow, County Wicklow *Athy, County Kildare *Ardee, County Louth *Athlone, County Roscommon and County Westmeath *Antrim, County Antrim *Aughnacloy, County Tyrone *Bagenalstown, County Carlow *Balbriggan, County Dublin *Ballymena, County Antrim *Ballymoney, County Antrim *Belturbet, County Cavan *Ballyshannon, County Donegal *Banbridge, County Down *Bangor, County Down *Ballybay, County Monaghan *Ballinasloe, County Galway and County Roscommon *Ballina, County Mayo *Boyle, County Roscommon *Carlow, County Carlow *Callan, County Kilkenny *Clonakilty, County Cork *Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary *Cashel, County Tipperary *Cavan, County Cavan *Cootehill, County Cavan *Coleraine, County Londonderry *Carrickmacross, County Monaghan *Castleblayney, County Monaghan *Clones, County Monaghan *Cookstown, County Tyrone *Castlebar, County Mayo *Dundalk, County Louth *Dromore, County Down *Enniscorthy, County Wexford *Ennis, County Clare *Fermoy, County Cork *Gorey, County Wexford *Gilford, County Down *Holywood, County Down *Killiney and Ballybrack, County Dublin *Kells, County Meath *Kinsale, County Cork *Keady, County Antrim *Killarney, County Kerry *Longford, County Longford *Lismore, County Waterford *Larne, County Antrim *Lisburn, County Antrim and County Down *Lurgan, County Armagh *Letterkenny, County Donegal *Limavady, County Londonderry *Loughrea, County Galway *Maryborough, Queen's County *Mountmellick, Queen's County *Mullingar, County Westmeath *Midleton, County Cork *Naas, County Kildare *Newbridge, County Kildare *Navan, County Meath *New Ross, County Wexford *Nenagh, County Tipperary *Newtownards, County Down *Parsontown, King's County *Portadown, County Armagh *Rathkeale, County Limerick *Roscommon, County Roscommon *Skibbereen, County Cork *Strabane, County Tyrone *Tullamore, King's County *Trim, County Meath *Templemore, County Tipperary *Thurles, County Tipperary *Tipperary, County Tipperary *Tandragee, County Antrim *Tuam, County Galway *Westport, County Mayo According to the 1878 report of The Local Government Board, the 1854 Act was adopted in Strandtown, County Antrim on 25 February 1878. However the town is not listed in later reports, and was subsequently incorporated into the borough of Belfast. =Towns governed under the 1828 Act= Only 11 towns were still governed by the act: *Armagh, County Armagh *Bandon, County Cork *Downpatrick, County Down *Dungannon, County Tyrone *Fethard, County Tipperary *Mallow, County Cork *Monaghan, County Monaghan *Omagh, County Tyrone *Tralee, County Kerry *Wicklow, County Wicklow *Youghal, County Cork =Towns and Townships under Special Acts= There were 14 towns with commissioners formed under such legislation: *Blackrock, County Dublin *Bray, County Wicklow *Clontarf, County Dublin *Dalkey, County Dublin *Drumcondra, County Dublin *Enniskillen, County Fermanagh *Galway, County Galway *New Kilmainham, County Dublin *Kingstown, County Dublin *Newry, County Armagh and County Down *Pembroke, County Dublin *Queenstown, County Cork *Rathmines and Rathgar, County Dublin =Towns governed under the Municipal Corporations Act= Only one town had established Municipal Commissioners following the 1840 Act: *Carrickfergus, County Antrim In addition to these 102 towns there were 11 boroughs, making 113 towns and cities with some form of local government on Ireland. For completeness, the boroughs were *Belfast *Clonmel *Cork *Drogheda *Dublin *Kilkenny *Limerick *Derry *Sligo *Waterford *Wexford (restored 1846) Changes in 1899‚Äì1901 The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 created a new type of local council the urban district governed by an urban district council. All town commissioners that were sanitary authorities became urban district councils. In addition the Local Government Board were given the power to constitute any other local government town with a population of more than 1500 as an urban district, although the ratepayers could petition to prevent the application of this section of the act. The effect of this was that the number of towns with commissioners was greatly reduced. By 1902 74 urban districts had been formed, leaving only 30 towns still governed under the 1854 act. (The two towns still operating under the 1828 act, Monaghan and Wicklow, were automatically promoted to the 1854 act by section 41 the 1898 act.Webb 1918, pp.242‚Äì243) These towns formed part of the surrounding rural district also created by the Local Government Act for nearly all local government purposes, compared with the urban district councils, who enjoyed considerable powers. Over the next few years the number varied as some towns became urban districtsand other communities adopted the act of 1854. Town Commissioners in Northern Ireland Following partition in 1922, four towns with commissioners situated in the six counties of Northern Ireland. The number was reduced to three in 1925 when Downpatrick became an urban district. The remaining town commissioners were dissolved in 1959 and 1962, their functions being transferred to the rural district council: *Antrim, County Antrim, dissolved 1962 *Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, dissolved 1959 *Gilford, County Down, dissolved 1959 Town Commissioners in independent Ireland In the Irish Free State and later the Republic of Ireland, town commissioners continued to exist until 2002. The 1854 act was still occasionally used to create new local government towns. The Local Government Act 1925 enabled existing town commissioners to dissolve themselves and for urban district councils to downgrade themselves to commissioners. Where commissioners ceased to exist, their duties were taken over by the county council. However, the town still had a legal existence and separate rates were levied in its area, and the county council had to prepare accounts as commissioners for the town. An example was Newcastle West in County Limerick, whose commissioners were dissolved in 1941, but who received a grant of a coat of arms by the Chief Herald of Ireland in 1980 ‚Äì the grant being to \\"Limerick County Council for the Town of Newcastle West\\". In 1994 all such towns were finally abolished, by Section 62 of the Local Government Act 1994. The Local Government Act 2001 redesignated town commissioners and urban district councils as town councils from 1 January 2002. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 abolished town councils and replaced them with local electoral areas within each county council following the enactment of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 on 1 June 2014. =List of Town Commissioners in Ireland 1922‚Äì2002= *Ardee, County Louth *Balbriggan, County Dublin *Ballinasloe, County Galway *Ballybay, County Monaghan *Ballyshannon, County Donegal *Bandon, County Cork *Bantry, County Cork *Belturbet, County Cavan, downgraded from Urban District 1950 *Boyle, County Roscommon *Callan, County Kilkenny, dissolved 1940 *Cootehill, County Cavan, downgraded from Urban District 1950 *Droichead Nua or Newbridge, County Kildare *Edenderry, County Offaly *Gorey, County Wexford *Granard, County Longford, downgraded from Urban District 1944 *Greystones, County Wicklow, created 1984 *Fethard, County Tipperary, dissolved 1936 *Kilkee, County Clare *Leixlip, County Kildare, created 1988 *Lismore, County Waterford *Loughrea, County Galway *Mountmellick, County Laois *Muine Bheag or Bagenalstown, County Carlow *Mullingar, County Westmeath *Newcastle West, County Limerick, dissolved 1941 *Passage West, County Cork *Portlaoise, County Laois *Rathkeale, County Limerick, dissolved 1926 *Roscommon, County Roscommon, dissolved 1927 *Shannon, County Clare, created 1982 *Tramore, County Waterford, created 1948 *Tuam, County Galway References =Sources= ;Primary: * ** ;Secondary: *Local Government in Ireland, Desmond Roche, Dublin 1982 * =Citations= Category:Local government in the United Kingdom Category:Local government in the Republic of Ireland ","title":"Town commissioners"},{"id":"3626149","text":"Baltimore City Paper was a free alternative weekly newspaper published in Baltimore, Maryland, founded in 1977 by Russ Smith and Alan Hirsch.

It was originally named the City Squeeze, and Smith and Hirsch published it using the offices of the Johns Hopkins student newspaper. In 1978, they took the paper out of the university and started publishing it as the Baltimore City Paper. Smith said that he viewed the paper as an alternatively weekly similar to the Chicago Reader and the Boston Real Paper. The paper was free, except for a time between 1979‚Äì81, where they charged 25¬¢ per issue. Charging a fee turned out to be mistake, as most of the paper's income came through advertising revenue and the fee led to a precipitous drop in circulation, and consequently advertising revenues.

History Frost French was created by Sadie Frost and Jemima French, who have been friends since they were fifteen. The fashion label began in London as a design based studio in 1999. At first the company sold only knickers and lingerie, though later expanded to a full women's wear collection. The company had an Autumn/Winter debut show, which featured Kate Moss's strip tease, on 17 February 2001 at the Duke of York's Theatre in the West End of London. During the London fashion week in 2003, they named their show the \\"Frost French Tea Party\\" at Regent's Park Open Air Theatre. After the exhibition ended, they hosted an afternoon tea party in collaborated with the Tea Council of Great Britain. In 2004, they won the Elle Style Award for \\"Best British Designer\\". In 2006, Frost and French appeared as guest judges on Project Catwalk's season 1, episode 2. In September 2007, Frost French opened a boutique store in Islington, London. The fashion label fell into administration due to ¬£4.2 million worth of debt in 2008 until John Jaokim, a Norwegian film producer and a property investor, bailed out Frost French by investing in the company. John Jaokim joined the board of directors after helping the fashion label financially. In 2009, they sought help from sales agents to reposition their brand and improve product distribution. In the same year, they decided to open their second boutique at Soho in London. The fashion label designed their second store to reflect the playful aesthetic side of Frost French. Although Frost French recovered in 2008, the company continued to face troubles in 2010 as they suffered a ¬£500,000 loss. Also, John Jaokim and Dominic McVey had resigned, as directors, leaving only Frost and French. Their Spring/Summer 2011 collection was discontinued. As a result, all of Frost French's stores in Islington and Soho had closed down. After the company disappeared, Frost and French continued to design lingerie, swimwear, and nightwear for the company's sister brands Floozie and Iris & Edie. Early in 2014, the owners gave an official statement of Frost French's plans to relaunch the company. The fashion label said that the relaunch would happen around September 2014 with the first design meeting being held in February 2014. As of 2016, the label has not relaunched, but continues to live on under the Floozie by Frost and French brand.http://www.debenhams.com/women/swimwear-beachwear/floozie-by-frost- french Products Frost French described their products as: \\"classical with a twist of pop.\\" According to the designers, their clothing appeals to the likes of a youthful London girl. They originally produced knickers for women, but they expanded their product line to a full women's wear collection, which includes coats, dresses, lingerie, shirts, and accessories. They have collaborated with Peugeot, GHD, 17 Cosmetics, and Olay in a variety of projects. They also had a contract with Liptons and they sold lipstick-stained teacups, which was an activity for their 'drink gorgeous' campaign.

The abridgement can be true to the original work in terms of mood and tone, capturing the parts the abridging author perceives to be most important; it could be a complete parody of the original or it could fall anywhere in between, generally capturing the tone and message of the original author but falling short in some manner or subtly twisting their words and message to favor a different interpretation or agenda. A written work may be abridged to make it more accessible to a wider audience; for example, to make an adaptation of it as an audio book or a television show, to make a more convenient companion to an already-established work or to create a shorter reference version. Unabridged is the opposite of abridged. A common example is an unabridged dictionary. Abridgement for audio Abridgement is most often used to adapt a book or film into a narrated audio version. Because books written for adults are generally meant to be read silently to oneself, which is usually much faster than reading aloud, most books can take between 20 and 40 hours to read aloud. Because many audio book listeners are looking to listen to the information in a book more quickly and because of the high cost associated with recording and distributing 40 hours of audio, audio book versions of novels are often produced in an abridged version. Some party, usually an editor for the book's publishing company, goes through the text of the book and removes elements, notations, references, narratives and sometimes entire scenes from a book that could be considered superfluous to the actual story or focus of the book in order to make its audible reading time shorter. A fully abridged audio book can span as little as 4 hours for a book that would span 20 hours unabridged. The easiest content of a fiction book to edit out is back story that is often provided for characters or story elements that help support the reality of the story for the reader but fails to provide any narrative to the story itself. For example, a passage such as \\"John sped away in his automobile, a red 1967 Mustang he'd purchased from a junkyard and spent most of his college years restoring with his father\\" could be abridged to \\"John sped away in his automobile, a red 1967 Mustang\\" or, if context permits, simply \\"John sped away.\\" In a nonfiction piece, the most commonly abridged details are references, charts, details and facts that are used to support an author's claim. While it would be unprofessional or irresponsible to omit such details from a book, it is understandable for an audio book, as it is assumed the listener wants to hear the author's opinion, and the listener who needs to check the details may refer to the text. Occasionally, an abridged audio book will be advertised as \\"abridgement approved by the author,\\" which would imply that the original work's author has reviewed the trimmed down version of the work and agrees that the intention or narrative of the story has not been lost or that no vital information has been removed. In many cases, an audio book for a popular title is available in both an abridged and unabridged version, but the abridged version often is released first and almost always costs significantly less than the unabridged version. Often, the two versions are produced independently of each other and may have different narrators. Unabridged versions of books are popular among those with poor eyesight or reading skills who wish to appreciate the entirety of the work, and the abridged version is more often preferred by those who want just a quick and entertaining say to follow the story. On the radio (for example, in British Radio 4 programmes as Book of the Week, Book at Bedtime, and Go 4 It for children), books are almost always abridged and so if someone were trying to read along with the book, one would find it much more difficult than on an audio book. Abridgement for print A shortened form of literary work in which the major themes of the original are kept occurs in books for faster and easier reading. The Signet Classics Abridged Works are notable examples of abridgment; the Signet Classics Bible, for example, is 40 percent shorter than the 850,000-word King James Version. Although well-known passages in abridged works are often left intact, editors may remove \\"repetition, rhetoric and redundancy\\" from a complete work. Until roughly the mid-19th century, the act of abridgment was widely regarded as fair use and was among the most frequently abused loopholes in British and American copyright law. However, by the 1870s, international outcry from authors and publishers alike prompted legislatures to consider revisions to end the \\"very unreasonable\\" principle. While increasingly uncommon, some books are published as abridged versions of earlier books, which is most common in textbooks, usually lengthy works in complicated fields like engineering or medicine. Abridged versions of popular textbooks are published to be used as study aids or to provide enough surface information for the reader to become familiar with the material but not have a full understanding of it or its full scope. Abridgement for television Plays, notably by Shakespeare, have very often been heavily abridged for television to fit them into ninety-minute or two-hour time slots. (The same is true of long classical ballets such as the two-and-a-half hour Sleeping Beauty, which has almost never been performed complete on television.) It was done more often in the past than it is now (such as in Hallmark Hall of Fame from the 1950s to about 1970). With the advent of such noncommercially- sponsored PBS anthologies such as Great Performances, Live from Lincoln Center and the BBC Television Shakespeare plays, there is now less pressure to cram a play lasting at least three hours, such as Hamlet, into a two-hour time slot. Abridged series An abridged series is a fanmade parody series that uses footage from the original series, often filled with comedic redubbing. It is called \\"abridged\\" because episodes are not as long as the original episodes. Most of the abridged series that are created are based on anime and uploaded onto YouTube, which sometimes get taken down because of claims of copyright infringement. The first abridged series, Yu-Gi-Oh! The Abridged Series, was created by Martin Billany, better known by his screen name LittleKuriboh, in 2006 and has since inspired multiple new ones.

He was the co-founder of the Courant Institute at New York University, and a recipient of the National Medal of Science.National Medal of Science Biography Friedrichs was born in Kiel, Schleswig-Holstein on September 28, 1901. His family soon moved to D√ºsseldorf, where he grew up. He attended several different universities in Germany studying the philosophical works of Heidegger and Husserl, but finally decided that mathematics was his real calling. During the 1920s, Friedrichs pursued this field in G√∂ttingen, which had a renowned Mathematical Institute under the direction of Richard Courant. Courant became a close colleague and lifelong friend of Friedrichs. In 1931, Friedrichs became a full professor of mathematics at the Technische Hochschule in Braunschweig. In early February 1933, a few days after Hitler became the Chancellor of Germany, Friedrichs met and immediately fell in love with a young Jewish student, Nellie Bruell. Their relationship became increasingly challenging and difficult because of the anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws of Hitler's government. In 1937, both Friedrichs and Nellie Bruell managed to emigrate separately to New York City where they finally married. Their long and very happy marriage produced five children.Life of K. O. Friedrichs Courant had left Germany in 1933 and had founded an institute for graduate studies in mathematics at New York University. Friedrichs joined him when he arrived in 1937 and remained there for forty years. He was instrumental in the development of the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, which eventually became one of the most distinguished research institutes for applied mathematics in the world. Friedrichs died in New Rochelle, New York on December 31, 1982. Friedrichs's greatest contribution to applied mathematics was his work on partial differential equations. He also did major research and wrote many books and papers on existence theory, numerical methods, differential operators in Hilbert space, non-linear buckling of plates, flows past wings, solitary waves, shock waves, combustion, magneto-fluid dynamical shock waves, relativistic flows, quantum field theory, perturbation of the continuous spectrum, scattering theory, and symmetric hyperbolic equations. With Cartan, Friedrichs gave a \\"geometrized\\" formulation of Newtonian gravitation theory‚Äîalso known as ‚ÄúNewton‚ÄìCartan theory‚Äù‚Äî and later developed by Dautcourt, Dixon, Dombrowski and Horneffer, Ehlers, Havas, K√ºnzle, Lottermoser, Trautman, and others. A member of the National Academy of Sciences since 1959, Friedrichs received many honorary degrees and awards for his work. There is a student prize named after Friedrichs at NYU. The American Mathematical Society selected him as the Josiah Willards Gibbs lecturer for 1954.Josiah Willard Gibbs Lectures In November 1977, Friedrichs received the National Medal of Science from President Jimmy Carter \\"for bringing the powers of modern mathematics to bear on problems in physics, fluid dynamics, and elasticity.\\" Selected bibliography *R. von Mises and K.

History It was founded as an exempt abbey named after Saint Peter in 983 by Bishop Gebhard of Constance, located on the northern shore of the Rhine river opposite to the episcopal residence at Constance with its cathedral. Gebhard dedicated the monastery church to Pope Gregory the Great and settled the abbey with monks descending from Einsiedeln. Petershausen, early 18th century Under Bishop Gebhard III of Z√§hringen and Abbot Theodoric (1086‚Äì1116), the Hirsau Reforms were introduced. In 1097 a filial monastery was established at Mehrerau near Bregenz by Ulrich X, count of Bregenz and his wife, Bertha of Rheinfelden. As Petershausen sided with the papacy in the Investiture Controversy, Gebhard III in 1103 was deposed at the instigation of Emperor Henry IV. The abbey was closed until 1106, the monks fled to the newly established Kastl Abbey in Bavaria. In 1159 the monastery burnt down, and was rebuilt and extended between 1162 and 1180. =Imperial Abbey= Embroiled in constant disputes over land and jurisdiction with the nearby city and bishopric of Constance as well as with Swabian nobles like the Counts of Montfort, the abbots turned to the Imperial Hohenstaufen dynasty for support. Mindful of the abbey's strategic location at the junction of the Rhine and Lake Constance, Emperor Frederick II, granted immediacy to Petershausen, which thus gained territorial independence as an imperial abbey.http://www.sueddeutscher-barock.ch/In-Werke/h-r/Petershausen.html During the Council of Constance (1414‚Äì18), the German king Sigismund of Luxembourg stayed at the Petershausen and the abbot was even given the pontifical vestments from Antipope John XXIII. However, the monastery declined during the 14th and 15th centuries, pressed hard by both the free imperial city and the prince-bishopric of Constance. The attempts of Prince-Bishop Hugo von Hohenlandenberg to annex Petershausen were blocked by Maximilian I. However Petershausen was to lose its independence to the city of Constance. The abbey is freed after Constance, which had officially become Protestant in 1530, is conquered by the Spanish troops of Charles V during the Schmalkaldic War, forcibly re-Catholicized, stripped of its status as a free imperial city and absorbed into Further Austria. In 1556, the monks returned to their restored monastery, which slowly recovers thanks to the help of the nearby nobility.http://www.sueddeutscher-barock.ch/In-Werke/h-r/Petershausen.html During the Thirty Years' War, the abbey was compelled to build fortification around the monastery and town at its own expenses. A panorama of the fortified abbey can be seen in Matth√§us Merian's engraving showing Constance and Petershausen during the siege of 1633. A slow recovery of the abbey began after the end of this destructive war. Petershausen was finally secularised to Baden in 1802; the library was purchased by the University Library Heidelberg.\\"Special Collections\\", University of Heidelberg Margrave Charles Frederick of Baden had parts of the abbey rebuilt as a private residence for his sons. The St Gregory Church was demolished in 1832. The remaining premises were later used as a psychiatric hospital and as barracks.

It is important in literary history as the home of Samuel Crisp (1707‚Äì1783), a close friend of Fanny Burney, the novelist. At the time of the house's existence, Chessington was a village in Surrey; it now forms part of the urban sprawl of contemporary Greater London. At the time of Samuel Crisp's occupancy, Chessington was a tiny village that stood on a large and nearly desolate common. Crisp retreated to the isolation of Chessington Hall after the failure of his play Virginia in 1754, after selling his house in Hampton, and much of his book and art collection. Crisp shared the house with his friend Christopher Hamilton. Crisp was a close friend of Charles Burney, the musicologist, and came to know his daughter, Fanny Burney. It is likely that Fanny wrote much of her second novel, Cecilia (published in 1782), in the summer house at Chessington, and the pair were frequent and fond correspondents. Crisp died on 24 April 1783 and is buried in the churchyard at Chessington. He is commemorated by a memorial in the church. The original house, said to date to 1520, was demolished in 1832 and replaced by a new building. From about 1850 to 1910 the Hall was occupied by the Chancellor family; their estate papers are housed in the Surrey History Centre in Woking. In the 1930s the village of Chessington was chosen as a centre for council housing. The house and estate were purchased by compulsory purchase order of Kingston Borough Council in 1946, and the Hall demolished in 1965, at a time when historic houses were regarded as of little value. The housing estate built on the estate is a typical example of 1950s architecture. Nothing survives of the rural charm or history of Chessington Hall, except for the monuments and graves of its occupants in Chessington churchyard.

He obtained commissions for his psychedelic painted furniture from Princess Margaret, did work for the Beatles in the early 1960s, worked for Expo 67 and Lord John in Carnaby Street, while photographer David Bailey used his work for a series of posters. He was also involved with two events at the Chalk Farm Roundhouse; Jimi Hendrix appeared at one of them on 22 February 1967. Early life and education Vaughan was born in Manchester, England, the son of two factory workers. He studied art in Ashton-under-Lyne and Bradford, where Douglas Binder and Dudley Edwards were fellow students, before moving to London to take up the offer of a place at the Slade School of Fine Art. Career On leaving art school, he set up a very successful design team, inviting Binder and Edwards from Bradford to join him to form BEV (the name derived from the first letters of their surnames). For several years during the mid-1960s they produced customised cars and furniture. Vaughan was invited to America by Macy's department store to demonstrate his techniques, as Artist in Residence. He was also approached by the chairman of Pan Am who wanted some jets customising. He travelled across the US in his customised Buick 6, promoting Swinging London. On returning to Britain, after being commissioned by Paul McCartney to paint a piano in psychedelic colours, he asked the Beatle if he was interested in participating in The Million Volt Light and Sound Rave planned for 28 January 1967. Carnival of Light, an avant- garde recording yet to be commercially published, was recorded by the Beatles on 5 January and played once for the happening.https://recordmecca.com/item- archives/the-beatles-million-volt-light-sound-rave-poster/ He also accepted a commission to paint a giant psychedelic mural on the exterior three-storey- high wall of a building on Carnaby Street that housed the Lord John boutique. While he was working from a cradle on the giant mural, a visitor let one of the securing ropes go, plunging the cradle three storeys, and landing on the ground with Vaughan trapped under the visitor. He appeared unhurt, but suffered an undiagnosed head injury. Instead of taking him to hospital to be examined, his friends gave him some LSD to \\"calm him down\\", which in fact flipped his mind. He then spent three years as a down and out, suffering from manic depression, which affected him for the rest of his life. He eventually got his life back on track with a new wife, to whom he was married for over 30 years. He rejected the \\"London scene\\" and moved back to Manchester, where he became the country's most prolific mural artist, during the 1970s and early 1980s. He formed the mural group \\"Noah's Ark\\", which as well as producing mural art for the under-privileged in youth clubs, schools, churches and hospitals (he painted the first British hospital mural at the Duchess of York's Hospital for Babies in Manchester), offered young and disadvantaged people the opportunity to study mural painting first hand. During the 1970s he employed a variety of young people to assist and learn how to produce a mural, and he also completed many private commissions, re-creating on a smaller scale some of the success he achieved in the 1960s. These included customized shops ‚Äì Barratts\\"Barratts of Manchester\\", Manchester Beat. music shop on Oxford Road, Manchester, became a mecca for art/music students who visited to see the huge portraits of jazz and blues musicians adorning the walls, which were just a part of the complete makeover Vaughan gave the premises in 1974. In the mid-1980s he started to produce his \\"Victims\\" series of paintings, which depicted some of the horrors of modern society, and which were found to be quite controversial at the time. In his later career he returned to painting portraits ‚Äì John Lennon, Bob Dylan, Gallagher and also pencil portraits of David Beckham and Jude Law. Vaughan died while awaiting a liver transplant. Private life Vaughan was married three times. He was survived by five sons and two daughters.

(The term derives from the Greek word \\"phainomenon\\", meaning \\"appearance\\".) The principle was initially defended by Michael Huemer in Huemer 2001, where it was formulated as follows: *If it seems to S as if p, then S thereby has at least prima facie justification for believing that p. A later formulation (Huemer 2007), designed to allow the principle to encompass inferential as well as foundational justification, reads as follows: *If it seems to S that p, then, in the absence of defeaters, S thereby has at least some degree of justification for believing that p.  Arguments for PC  Phenomenal conservatism has been defended on three grounds. #First, the principle enables one to account for the justification of most, perhaps all, of the beliefs that we commonly take as justified, including sensory observations, memory beliefs, and beliefs based on reasoning. #Second, it is argued that alternative epistemological positions are self-defeating in the sense that, unless PC is true, few or no beliefs would be justified, including beliefs in any alternative epistemological theories. This is supported by the claims #*that all or nearly all beliefs are causally explained by appearances, that is, one believes a proposition because it seems true to one; and #*that a belief is justified only if it is causally explained by a factor that constitutes justification for the proposition believed. #Third, it is argued that PC is most faithful to the motivations underlying epistemological internalism.  Criticisms of PC  Critics of phenomenal conservatism have argued: *That the principle is overly liberal, making far too many beliefs count as justified. In particular, PC implies that one is justified in believing a proposition that appears true to one, even in the absence of any reason for thinking that the faculty generating the appearance is reliable. *That the self-defeat argument unfairly begs the question against skepticism. *That the self-defeat argument cannot establish that externalist alternatives to PC are self-defeating without appeal to internalist assumptions. *That the intuitions that seem to favor PC over rival internalist views support views on which fallacious reasoning can count as justified. *That (in its original formulation) the principle makes inferential beliefs count as foundational. *That PC enables a belief to be justified even when the relevant appearance (and so the belief) was ultimately caused by epistemically irresponsible behavior, such as wishful thinking. *That seeming-based justification is elusive, in the sense that it can be destroyed by one's mere reflecting on one's seemings and speculating about their possible causes. In addition, as a form of foundationalism, PC is open to some of the common objections to that doctrine.  Annotated bibliography  #Huemer, Michael.

The vessel was assigned to the James River Flotilla of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron upon completion in April 1864. The ship spent most of her time stationed up the James River where she could support operations against Richmond and defend against a sortie by the Confederate ironclads of the James River Squadron. She engaged Confederate artillery batteries during the year and later participated in both attacks on Fort Fisher, defending the approaches to Wilmington, North Carolina, in December 1864‚ÄìJanuary 1865. Saugus returned to the James River after the capture of Fort Fisher and remained there until Richmond, Virginia was occupied in early April. A few days later, the monitor was transferred to Washington, D. C. and used to temporarily incarcerate some of the suspected conspirators after the assassination of President Lincoln. She was decommissioned in June and recommissioned in early 1869 for service in the Caribbean and off the coast of Florida. Saugus was again recommissioned in late 1872 and generally remained active until late 1877. She was condemned in 1886 and sold for scrap in 1891. Description and construction The ship was long overall, had a beam of and had a maximum draft of . Saugus displaced .Silverstone, p. 7 Her crew consisted of 100 officers and enlisted men. Saugus was powered by a two- cylinder horizontal vibrating-lever steam engine that drove one propeller using steam generated by two Stimers horizontal fire-tube boilers.Canney, p. 85 The engine gave the ship a top speed of . She carried of coal.Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 122 Sauguss main armament consisted of two smoothbore, muzzle- loading, Dahlgren guns mounted in a single gun turret. Each gun weighed approximately . They could fire a shell up to a range of at an elevation of +7¬∞.Olmstead, et al., p. 94 The exposed sides of the hull were protected by five layers of wrought iron plates, backed by wood. The armor of the gun turret and the pilot house consisted of ten layers of one-inch plates. The ship's deck was protected by armor thick. A soft iron band was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent shells and fragments from jamming the turret as had happened to earlier monitors during the First Battle of Charleston Harbor in April 1863. The base of the funnel (ship) was protected to a height of by of armor. A \\"rifle screen\\" of armor high was installed on the top of the turret to protect the crew against Confederate snipers based on a suggestion by Commander Tunis A. M. Craven, captain of her sister ship .West, pp. 15‚Äì16 The contract for Saugus, the first Navy ship to be named Saugus after the town of Saugus, Massachusetts,Saugus was awarded to Harlan & Hollingsworth; the ship was laid down in 1862 at their Wilmington, Delaware shipyard.Canney, p. 138 She was launched on 14 December 1863 and commissioned on 7 April 1864 with Commander Edmund R. Colhoun in command. The ship's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors. This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret. Other changes included deepening the hull by to increase the ship's buoyancy, moving the position of the turret to balance the ship's trim and replacing all of the ship's deck armor.Roberts, pp. 75‚Äì76, 80, 118‚Äì19 As far as is known the ship was not modified after her completion.Canney, p. 86  Service  Saugus was assigned to the James River Flotilla and arrived at Fort Monroe on 1 May.ORN, v. 9, p. 714 By 22 May, the ship was deployed with her sisters and Tecumseh on the James River where they protected the transports of Major General Benjamin Butler's Army of the James, supplying the army as it operated on the south bank of the river during the Bermuda Hundred Campaign. On 21 June, Commander Craven of the Tecumseh spotted a line of breastworks that the Confederates were building at Howlett's Farm and his ship opened fire at the workers. The Confederates replied with a battery of four guns near the breastworks and Saugus and Canonicus joined in the bombardment. A half-hour later, Confederate ships near Dutch Gap joined in, but their fire was ineffective because they were firing blindly at the Union monitors. During the engagement, Saugus fired thirty-six 15-inch shells and was hit once by a Confederate shell that struck the deck and ricocheted into the turret; no one was wounded or killed during the engagement. Eight days later, Saugus and the side-wheel gunboat engaged a battery at Deep Bottom Creek. The same pair of ships engaged another battery on Four Mile Creek on 31 June and 1 July.ORN, v. 10, pp. 36, 178‚Äì81, 217, 225‚Äì26 Saugus was still under repair at the Norfolk Navy Yard in early September when she received orders to proceed with Canonicus and the gunboats and to Port Royal, South Carolina, and there await Admiral David Farragut, the prospective commander of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, in anticipation of an attack on Fort Fisher. This deployment was cancelled on 19 September when poor health caused Farragut to decline the appointment.ORN, v. 10, p. 469 The ship returned to the James and resumed supporting the Union Army. In an engagement with Howlett's Battery on 5 December, Saugus was hit twice. One of the shots from a Brooke rifle disabled her turret temporarily when it cracked an armor plate and broke a number of bolts. The monitor ran aground on 14 December and she was refloated the following day.ORN, v. 11, pp. 144‚Äì47, 194, 601 Saugus was repaired at Norfolk and she was then towed by the gunboat Nereus. They departed on 22 December and arrived off Fort Fisher on Christmas Eve. The next day, Saugus joined the bombardment of the Confederate fortifications from a range of . Colhoun reported that he saw one Confederate gun dismounted by his ship's shells; Saugus fired 64 shells during the day. After Butler ordered his men re-embarked onto their transports on 26 December, the monitor was towed to Beaufort, South Carolina by the gunboat .ORN, v. 11, pp. 276‚Äì77, 378 Towed by the side-wheel gunboat , Saugus arrived back at Fort Fisher on 13 January 1865. Together with her sisters Canonicus and , the double-turreted monitor and the armored frigate , she bombarded the fort for three days until it was captured by Union troops. Despite the bursting of one of her guns on 13 January, which wounded one crewman, the ship fired 212 shells during the battle. Saugus was hit 11 times, cracking armor plates on her pilothouse and turret in addition to breaking bolts, but she was not badly damaged. Nonetheless, the monitor was ordered to return to Norfolk for repairs on 16 January, towed by the sidewheel gunboat .ORN, v. 11, pp. 432‚Äì33, 461, 467‚Äì68, 604 On 23 January, as the ship was en route for the Washington Navy Yard for repairs, the Confederate James River Squadron attempted to slip through the obstructions at Trent's Reach for an attack on the Union gunboats and transports, but they were repulsed before Saugus reached City Point four days later. Sauguss crew posing for the camera, probably on the James River in early 1865 Saugus remained on the James for the next month and contributed boats for clearing the river of \\"torpedoes\\" after the Confederate ships were scuttled on the night of 2/3 April and Richmond occupied. On 5 April, the ship, now under the command of Lieutenant B. F. Day, and Mahopac were ordered report to the Washington Navy Yard.ORN, v. 12, pp. 98‚Äì99, 102, 118 After the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on 15 April, eight of the suspected conspirators were incarcerated aboard Saugus and the monitor . On 30 April, they were transferred off the ships to the Arsenal Penitentiary.  Post-war operations  Saugus was decommissioned and laid up at Washington, D. C., on 13 June 1865. Recommissioned on 30 April 1869, the monitor steamed to Cuba to investigate reports of mistreatment of US citizens during a revolt there. She then patrolled along the Florida coast until she was laid up at Key West, Florida on the last day of 1870. During this time, the ship was renamed Centaur on 15 June 1869, but resumed her original name on 10 August 1869. After being towed to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for repairs, Saugus was recommissioned there on 9 November 1872 and was based at Key West until transferred to Port Royal, South Carolina in 1876. During this period the ship was out of commission from 9 March to 10 October 1874. Saugus returned to Washington in 1877 and was decommissioned there on 8 October. She was condemned in 1886 and sold for scrap on 25 May 1891.

Shane O'Neill, chief of the O'Neills of T√≠r Eoghain, was defeated by Aodh mac Maghnusa √ì Domhnaill (Hugh O'Donnell) and the O'Donnells freed themselves from O'Neill aspirations of ruling Ulster as its King. If Elizabeth, your mistress, is Queen of England, I am O'Neill, King of Ulster; I never made peace with her without having been previously solicited to it by her. I am not ambitious for the abject title of Earl. . . . I have gained that kingdom by my sword, and by the sword I will preserve it.' Shane O'Neill's response to Queen Elizabeth message offering him an English title. Background Shane O'Neill had, in the previous 20 years, eliminated his rivals within the O'Neills and asserted his authority over neighbouring clans (or \\"septs\\") the MacDonnells in Antrim and O'Donnells in Donegal. In 1566, the English Lord Deputy of Ireland, Henry Sidney, gave military support to the O'Donnells against O'Neill, who was regarded as a destabilising and anti-English power in the north of Ireland. O'Neill forced out these English troops, but the new O'Donnell chieftain, Hugh O'Donnell, took the opportunity to assert his independence and raided O'Neill's lands at Strabane. In response, O'Neill mustered his armed forces and marched into O'Donnell territory. The battle O'Neill crossed into Tir Connell (O'Donnell territory) the traditional way by crossing the River Swilly at an Fearsaid mh√≥r (known as Porterfields to-day); this is about 3 km East of the modern town of Letterkenny. O'Donnell had advance warning of this impending incursion so had prepared for the forthcoming attack by dispatching messengers to all his people. Both sides were not equal in size O'Neills army is estimated at 2,000 men and were composed of Cavalry (Nobility), Gallowglass, Kearn and a small body of English soldiers who had deserted to him to provide modern weapon skills to his host. O'Donnells initial forces was only about 40-foot and 80 horse (his personal guard). O'Donnell's horsemen harassed O'Neill's men immediately after his fording of the river, leaving O'Donnell a short breathing space to locate his small force in a more defensible position, at Magherennan (near the entrance to the Letterkenny Rugby club to-day). When their lord was in position the O'Donnell cavalry withdrew and there O'Donnell awaited his reinforcements. While his opponent waited, O'Neill set up his camp in Cluain Aire beside the River to cover the ford. When finally O'Donnells troops did arrive they numbered 400 Gallowglass from all the MacSweeney septs. With this virtual parity in the (usually) decisive heavy infantry the O'Donnell host proceeded to advance on O'Neill's camp. Shane when first perceiving their attack said: ‚ÄòIt is very wonderful and amazing to me that those people should not find it easier to make full concessions to us, and submit to our awards, than thus come forward to us to be immediately slaughtered and destroyed.‚Äô AFM 1563 This statement, made just as the armies met, must have been a late attempt to put heart into his own surprised army. Significantly the main O'Donnell war host had employed rising ground to successfully cover their advance until it was far too late for O'Neill to deploy his own Gallowglass spars into proper line of battle to hold the enemy while the O'Neill horse mounted up. The O'Neill army were caught utterly unprepared, in much the same way as O'Neill himself had taken a MacDonnell host by surprise at Glentaisie in 1565. Despite the element of surprise and O'Neill's lack of manoeuvre room, the resistance of the surprised O'Neill Gallowglass in this encounter battle was at first successful for the Four Masters state that the action lasted \\"for a long time.\\" Eventually, with their loose protective screen of gallowglass cut down, a panicked rout of Shane's force ensued. The O'Donnell pressure of attack continued so fiercely that the broken O'Neill host was forced back on the ford and attempted to recross the Swilly. As the tide was now coming in, many of them to simply drowned in the speeding rush of waters (4‚Äì7 knots average). O'Neill's losses are estimated by their enemies at 1,400 men killed and no prisoners are mentioned, although the English sources note a more credible total of 680 dead. With many of his most senior commanders and advisors killed amid the chaos of the first onslaught, O'Neill himself escaped the final slaughter with the timely aid of a party of the Gallaghers. They guided him to Ath an Tairsi (Ford of protection) near Crieve Smith in Oldtown to-day, (not to be confused with Scarrifholis which is further up the river) where they escorted him to his own territory and relative safety. The aftermath Many of the Donnelleys, Shane's foster family and the source of his strongest support, had defended him to the last and were decimated at Farsetmore. Abandoned by his tanist√© and all of his Urr√≠the, literally under-kings, and with the destruction of his army, the 'most powerful force Gaelic Ireland had yet witnessed',Christopher Mangin, 'Shane O'Neill' National Dictionary of National Biography, vol. 41, (Oxford, 2007). Shane began looking for a mercenary force to sustain him until he could make good his losses. With all other options closed he turned to a warband hired to fight against him the previous winter by William PiersHerbert Francis Hoare, 'The Ulster State papers' Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Series I, no. 7, (Belfast 1859), p.61. from among the MacDonald's of Dunnyveg. He arrived at their camp at Cushendun with a small retinue, during their negotiations an altercation occurred, in which Shane was killed. Despite being engineered by Piers,Ciarn Brady 'The Killing of Shane O'Neill: some new evidence', Irish Sword vol. xv, (1982‚Äì83), pp. 116‚Äì123. this assassination has gone down in history as retribution for Shane's military action against the MacDonalds in 1565. Shane was buried in a place called CrossSkern Church at Ballyterrim townland in the hills above Cushendun,Roland Spottiswoode, '\\"At the Grave of Shane O'Neill', Commemorations at Shane's Cairn Cushendun, 1908‚Äì1914' D√∫iche N√©ill no 18 (2010), pp.9‚Äì28 later his remains were exhumed his head then being sent to Dublin.

Some violins, called \\"bench-made\\" instruments, are made by a single individual, either a master maker, or an advanced amateur working alone. Several people may participate in the making of a \\"shop-made\\" instrument, working under the supervision of a master. Various levels of \\"trade violin\\" exist, often mass- produced by workers who each focus on a small part of the overall job, with or without the aid of machinery. \\"Setting up\\" a violin is generally considered to be a separate activity, and may be done many times over the lengthy service life of the instrument. Setup includes fitting and trimming tuning pegs, surfacing the fingerboard, carving the soundpost and bridge, adjusting the string spacing and action height, and other tasks related to putting the finished instrument into playing condition and optimizing its \\"voice\\" (its sound, tone, and timbre) and responsiveness to playing. Violin maintenance goes on as long as the instrument is to be kept in playing condition, and includes tasks such as replacing strings, positioning the soundpost and bridge, lubricating pegs and fine tuners, resurfacing the fingerboard, attending to the instrument's finish, and restoring, repairing, or replacing parts of the violin or its accessories which have suffered wear or damage. Making violins A new violin scroll being carved. The outer contour of a new violin, one of the more important aspects of the instrument, is designed by the violin maker, and in the 2020s, the outlines of the old masters' violins are usually used. Different methods of violin making include using an inside mould, an outside mould, or building \\"on the back\\" without a mould. The \\"inside mould\\" approach starts with a set of plans, which include a drawing of the outer shape of the instrument. From these plans a template is constructed, which can be made from thin metal or other materials, and is a flat \\"half- violin\\" shape. The template is used to construct a mould, which is a violin- shaped piece of wood, plywood, MDF or similar material approximately 12 mm or 1/2\\" thick. Around the mould are built the sides (or ribs), which are flat pieces of wood curved by means of careful heating. The completed \\"garland\\" of ribs, blocks, and linings is removed from the mould to allow attachment of the separately carved top and back. When the body is complete, the neck, which is carved out of a separate piece of wood (usually maple), is set in its mortise to complete the basic structure of the instrument, after which it is varnished. Violin taken down, with upright soundpost visible through the sound hole. Vital to the sound and playability of the instrument is setup, which includes adjusting the neck angle if needed, fitting the pegs so they turn smoothly and hold firmly, dressing the fingerboard to the proper scooped shape, fitting the soundpost and bridge, adjusting the tailgut and installing the tailpiece, and stringing up. A removable chinrest may be put on at this time. Then the instrument begins the \\"playing-in\\" process, as its parts adjust to the string tension. The sound of a violin is said to \\"open up\\" in the first weeks and months of use, a process which continues more gradually over the years. However, this process may be aborted at some point. If you put a violin to storage and pull it out a while later, you will notice when you first play that the violin has lost volume (this is a very common sign of violin inactivity), and loss of quality (this is in more severe cases of inactivity). If you put a violin into storage, pull it out a while later, and play it for a few weeks, you will notice the violin's sound start to \\"open up\\" again. Maintenance Close-up of rosin grains on end of fingerboard. With careful maintenance, a violin can last and improve for many years. A well-tended violin can outlive many generations of violinists, so it is wise to take a curatorial view when caring for a violin. Most importantly, if the collected rosin dust is not wiped from the varnish and left for long enough, it will fuse with the varnish and become impossible to remove without damage. Cleaning the rosin off strings can make a striking difference to the sound. A common wine cork serves admirably, quietly scrubbing off the crust of rosin without damaging the winding of the string. A dry microfiber cloth is often recommended; it retains the dust well, but makes a penetrating squeaking noise. A cloth with a little rubbing alcohol is effective, if care is taken to protect the top of the violin from the slightest chance of stray droplets of alcohol touching the varnish. The use of alcohol is generally avoided, as it easily damages varnish in ways which may be difficult or impossible to restore. The tuning pegs may occasionally be treated with \\"peg dope\\" when they either slip too freely, causing the string to go flat or slack, or when they stick, making tuning difficult. Some violinists and luthiers use a small amount of ordinary blackboard chalk on pegs to cure slippage. \\"Peg drops\\" (a solution of rosin in alcohol) may occasionally be used to treat slipping pegs, but that is a temporary solution at best; quite often slipping pegs have shafts which are no longer smoothly conical and should be refitted or replaced. The violin will benefit from occasional checks by a technician, who will know if repairs need to be made. Violinists generally carry replacement sets of strings to have a spare available in case one breaks. Even before breaking, worn strings may begin to sound tired and dull and become \\"false\\" over time, producing an unreliable pitch. Another common problem with strings is unravelling of the metal winding. Strings may need replacement every two or three months with frequent use. The higher strings require replacement more frequently than the lower strings since they are lighter in construction to produce a higher sound- fortunately their lighter weight also means they cost less. The price of strings varies, and the quality of the strings strongly influences the timbre of the sound produced. A teacher can advise students how often to change strings, as it depends on how much and seriously one plays. For the bow, the only real maintenance is regular cleaning of the stick with a cloth (to remove rosin dust), re-hairing, and replacing the leather and silver wire wrapping. In the course of playing, hairs are often lost from the bow, making it necessary to have it rehaired periodically, which is done by professionals at roughly the cost of a new set of strings. Other maintenance may include replacing the wire lapping and leather grip or lubricating the screw. Large cracks and breakages in the bow are usually fatal; they cannot be repaired like the body of the violin can. A bow which has warped and is no longer straight can sometimes be bent back to true or re-cambered, but this must be done with heat by a craftsman and is not always successful or worthwhile. Loosening the hair when the bow is not being used helps keep the bow from becoming \\"sprung\\" or losing its camber and the hair from becoming stretched. In the 2020s, there are bows available made from fiberglass or carbon composite which are less fragile. Some of the fiberglass bows are much cheaper than wooden bows. The best carbon composite bows are used by some professional musicians. Sound post adjustment The position of the sound post inside the violin is critical, and moving it by very small amounts can make a substantial difference in the sound quality of an instrument. The thickness of the post is important as well. Sound post adjustment is as much art as science, depending on the ears, experience, structural sense, and sensitive touch of the luthier. Moving the sound post has very complex consequences on the sound; in the end, it is the ear of the person doing the adjusting that determines the desired location of the post. Here are some rough guides to how sound post placement influences the sound quality of the instrument: * If the sound is too thin and shrill, the post may be too near the f hole or too tight, or the post may be too thin. * If the sound is weak and there is a loss of power (especially in the lower register), the post may be too near the center of the instrument. * If there is a loss of overall power and tone, the post may be too far behind the bridge, or the post may be too thick. Schools The traditional path into violin making is through apprenticing under an experienced luthier. However, there are also schools, and classes within universities, which may focus on different areas of violin making or repair, and others include auxiliary aspects of lutherie, such as playing, technical illustration and photography. Courses vary in length from several weeks to three or four years. =Belgium= *Ecole Internationale de Lutherie =Brazil= *O Curso de Luteria do Conservat√≥rio de Tatu√≠ *Curso superior de Tecnologia em Luteria da Universidade Federal Do Paran√° - UFPR =Canada= *Ecole Nationale de Lutherie **Quebec City, Quebec =Czech Republic= *Violin Making School Cheb **Cheb, Czech Republic =England= *London Guildhall University **London, England *Newark School of Violin Making **Newark-on-Trent, England *Chapel Violins School **Newark-on-Trent, England *West Dean College **Chichester, West Sussex *Merton College **Morden, Surrey *Cambridge Violin Makers Workshop **Cambridge, UK =Finland= *Ikaalinen Handicraft and Industrial Arts Institute =Germany= * Berufliches Schulzentrum (BSZ) f√ºr Technik Oelsnitz * Studiengang Musikinstrumentenbau Markneukirchen * Staatliche Berufsfach- und Fachschule f√ºr Geigenbau und Zupfinstrumentenmacher in Mittenwald =Italy= *Scuola Internazionale di Liuteria A.

Early life and education Vivier was born to unknown parents in Montreal. He was adopted at the age of three by a poor French-Canadian family. From the age of 13, he attended boarding schools run by the Marist Brothers, a religious order that prepared young boys for a vocation in the priesthood. In 1966, at the age of 18, Vivier was asked to leave the novitiate for ‚Äúlack of maturity‚Äù.Gilmore 2009, 18. His earliest works date from this period. He was always openly gay. In 1971, following study with Gilles Tremblay, he studied for three years in Europe, first with Gottfried Michael Koenig at the Institute for Sonology in Utrecht, and then in Cologne with Karlheinz Stockhausen.\\"Why Quebec composer Claude Vivier was ahead of his time\\". The Globe and Mail]. April 13, 2018, by Catherine Kustanczy Career Vivier learned much from Stockhausen, and his early works have aspects that are derivative of his teacher, though his later works bear little resemblance.Gilmore 2009, 36‚Äì37. In 1974, he returned to Montreal and began to establish his reputation. He spent some years travelling in Japan, Bali and Iran. Vivier's opera Kopernikus, to his own libretto, was premi√®red on 8 May 1980 at the Monument-National in Montreal. In 1982, Vivier moved to Paris. He was murdered there on 7 March 1983 by Pascal Dolzan, a homeless 19-year-old truqueur (a trickster who pretends to accept sexual advances in order to gain the opportunity to rob or harm the victim) he had met that evening at a bar. His body was discovered at home much later on 12 March.Gilmore 2014, 223‚Äì26.

The fittings are the tuning pegs, tailpiece and tailgut, endpin, possibly one or more fine tuners on the tailpiece, and in the modern style of playing, usually a chinrest, either attached with the cup directly over the tailpiece or to the left of it. There are many variations of chinrests such as clamped to the body in the center, on either side of the tailpiece as with a Guaneri style chinrest or to the left of the tailpiece. Body Violin by Albin Paul Knorr, Markneukirchen, showing flame figure on back and ribs The body of the violin is made of two arched plates fastened to a \\"garland\\" of ribs with animal hide glue. The ribs are what is commonly seen as the \\"sides\\" of the box. The rib garland includes a top block, four corner blocks (sometimes omitted in inexpensively mass- produced instruments,) a bottom block, and narrow strips called linings, which help solidify the curves of the ribs and provide extra gluing surface for the plates. From the top or back, the body shows an \\"hourglass\\" shape formed by an upper bout and a lower bout. Two concave C-bouts between each side's corners form the waist of this figure, providing clearance for the bow. The best woods, especially for the plates, have been seasoned for many years in large wedges, and the seasoning process continues indefinitely after the violin has been made. Glue joints of the instrument are held with hide glue since other adhesives can be difficult or impossible to reverse when future repairs are in order. Parts attached with hide glue can be separated when needed by using heat and moisture or careful prying with a thin knife blade. A well-tended violin can outlive many generations of violinists, so it is wise to take a curatorial view when caring for a violin. =Top= Typically the top (also known as the belly or table, in the U.K.) -- the soundboard) is made of quarter-sawn spruce, bookmatched at a strongly glued joint down the center, with two soundholes (or \\"f-holes\\", from their resemblance to a stylized letter \\"f\\") precisely placed between the C-bouts and lower corners. The soundholes affect the flex patterns of the top and allow the box to breathe as it vibrates. A decorative inlaid set of three narrow wooden strips, usually a light-colored strip surrounded by two dark strips, called purfling, runs around the edge of the top and is said to give some resistance to cracks originating at the edge. It is also claimed to allow the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Some violins have two lines of purfling or knot-work type ornaments inlaid in the back. Painted-on faux purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior violin. A slab-sawn bass bar fitted inside the top, running lengthwise under the bass foot of the bridge, gives added mass and rigidity to the top plate. Some cheaper mass-produced violins have an integral bass bar carved from the same piece as the top. Ideally the top is glued to the ribs and linings with slightly diluted hide glue to allow future removal with minimal damage. =Back and ribs= The back and ribs are typically made of maple, most often with a matching striped figure, called \\"flame.\\" Backs may be one-piece slab-cut or quarter-sawn or bookmatched two- piece quarter-sawn. Backs are also purfled, but in their case the purfling is less structurally important than for the top. Some fine old violins have scribed or painted rather than inlaid purfling on the back. The small semicircular extension of the back known as the \\"button\\" provides extra gluing surface for the crucial neck joint and is neglected when measuring the length of the back. Occasionally a half-circle of ebony surrounds the button, either to restore material lost in resetting the neck of an old instrument, or to imitate that effect. The ribs, having been bent to shape by heat, have their curved shape somewhat reinforced by lining strips of other wood at the top and bottom edges. The linings also provide additional gluing surface for the seams between the plates (top and bottom) and the rib edges. Neck Modern mensur, or proportion of neck stop to body stop The neck is usually maple with a flamed figure compatible with that of the ribs and back. It carries the fingerboard, typically made of ebony, but often some other wood stained or painted black. Ebony is considered the preferred material because of its hardness, appearance, and superior resistance to wear. Some very old violins were made with maple fingerboards carrying a veneer of ebony. At the peg end of the fingerboard sits a small ebony or ivory nut, infrequently called the upper saddle, with grooves to position the strings as they lead into the pegbox. The scroll at the end of the pegbox provides essential mass to tune the fundamental body resonance and provides a convenient grip for spare fingers to brace against when tuning one-handed (with the violin on the shoulder). Some \\"scrolls\\" are carved representations of animal or human heads instead of the classical spiral volute most normally seen. The maple neck alone is not strong enough to support the tension of the strings without distorting, relying for that strength on its lamination with the fingerboard. For this reason, if a fingerboard comes loose, as may happen, it is vital to loosen the strings immediately. The shape of the neck and fingerboard affect how easily the violin may be played. Fingerboards are dressed to a particular transverse curve and have a small lengthwise \\"scoop\\" or concavity, slightly more pronounced on the lower strings, especially when meant for gut or synthetic strings. The neck is not varnished, but is polished and perhaps lightly sealed to allow ease and rapidity of shifting between positions. Some old violins (and some made to appear old) have a grafted scroll or seam between the pegbox and neck. Many authentic old instruments have had their necks reset to a slightly increased angle and lengthened by about a centimeter. The neck graft allows the original scroll to be kept with a Baroque violin when bringing its neck to conformance with modern standard. Bridge The bridge is a precisely cut piece of maple, preferably with prominent medullary rays, showing a flecked figure. The bridge forms the lower anchor point of the vibrating length of the strings and transmits the vibration of the strings to the body of the instrument. Its top curve holds the strings at the proper height from the fingerboard, permitting each string to be played separately by the bow. The mass distribution and flex of the bridge, acting as a mechanical acoustic filter, have a prominent effect on the sound. Tuning the violin can cause the bridge to lean, usually toward the fingerboard, as the tightening of the strings pulls it. If left that way, it may warp. Experienced violinists know how to straighten and center a bridge. Sound post and bass bar Sound post & bridge foot The sound post or \\"soul post\\" fits precisely between the back and top, just to the tailward side of the treble bridge foot. It helps support the top under string pressure and has a variable effect on the instrument's tone, depending on its position and the tension of its fit. Part of adjusting the tone of the instrument is moving the sound post by small amounts laterally and along the long axis of the instrument using a tool called a sound post setter. Since the sound post is not glued and is held in place by string tension and being gently wedged between the top and back, it may fall over if all the strings are slackened at once. Running under the opposite side of the bridge is the bass bar. While the shape and mass of the bass bar affect tone, it is fixed in position and not so adjustable as the sound post. It is fitted precisely to the inside of the instrument at a slight angle to the centre joint. On many German trade instruments it used to be common fashion not to fit a bass bar but to leave a section of the front uncarved and shape that to resemble one. During the baroque era, bass bars were much shorter and thinner. Carving of a violin tailpiece Tailpiece The tailpiece may be wood, metal, carbon fiber, or plastic, and anchors the strings to the lower bout of the violin by means of the tailgut, nowadays most often a loop of stout nylon monofilament that rides over the saddle (a block of ebony set into the edge of the top) and goes around the endpin. The endpin fits into a tapered hole in the bottom block. Most often the material of the endpin is chosen to match the other fittings, for example, ebony, rosewood or boxwood. Very often the E string will have a fine tuning lever worked by a small screw turned by the fingers. Fine tuners may also be applied to the other strings and are sometimes built into the tailpiece. Fine tuners are usually used with solid metal or composite strings that may be difficult to tune with pegs alone; they are not used with gut strings, which have greater flexibility and don't respond adequately to the very small changes in tension of fine tuners. Some violinists, particularly beginners or those who favor metal strings, use fine tuners on all four strings. Using a fine tuner on the E string or built-in fine tuners limits the extent to which their added mass affects the sound of the instrument. Pegs A picture of the most common pegs made from ebony wood (Swiss model) for violin At the scroll end, the strings ride over the nut into the pegbox, where they wind around the tuning pegs. Strings usually have a colored \\"silk\\" wrapping at both ends for identification and to provide friction against the pegs. The peg shafts are shaved to a standard taper, their pegbox holes being reamed to the same taper, allowing the friction to be increased or decreased by the violinist applying appropriate pressure along the axis of the peg while turning it. Various brands of peg compound or peg dope help keep the pegs from sticking or slipping. Peg drops are marketed for slipping pegs. Pegs may be made of ebony, rosewood, boxwood, or other woods, either for reasons of economy or to minimize wear on the peg holes by using a softer wood for the pegs. Attempts have been made to market violins with machine tuners, but they have not been generally adopted primarily because earlier designs required irreversible physical modification of the pegbox, making violinists reluctant to fit them to classical instruments, and they added weight at the scroll. Early examples included large geared pegs that required much larger holes and/or bracing bars and additional holes, and tuning machines resembling those on a double bass, with metal plates screwed to the sides of the pegbox. Recent advances in machining technology have allowed the creation of several types of internally geared pegs the same size as the usual wooden pegs, requiring no more modification than would be seen in any peg replacement. Bow The bow consists of a stick with a ribbon of horsehair strung between the tip and frog (or nut, or heel) at opposite ends. At the frog end, a screw adjuster tightens or loosens the hair. The frog may be decorated with two eyes made of shell, with or without surrounding metal rings. A flat slide usually made of ebony and shell covers the mortise where the hair is held by its wedge. A metal ferrule holds the hair-spreading wedge and the shell slide in place. Just forward of the frog, a leather grip or thumb cushion protects the stick and provides grip for the violinist's hand. Forward of the leather, a winding serves a similar purpose, as well as affecting the balance of the bow. The winding may be wire, silk, or whalebone (now imitated by alternating strips of yellow and black plastic.) Some student bows, particularly the ones made of solid fiberglass, substitute a plastic sleeve for grip and winding. The stick was traditionally made of pernambuco - the heartwood of the brazilwood tree - but due to overharvesting and near extinction at its original source, other woods and materials, such as ironwood or graphite, are more commonly used. Some student bows are made of fiberglass. Recent innovations have allowed carbon-fiber to be used as a material for the stick at all levels of craftsmanship. The hair of the bow traditionally comes from the tail of a white male horse, although some cheaper bows use synthetic fiber. The hair must be rubbed with rosin occasionally so it will grip the strings and cause them to vibrate; new or unrosined bow hair simply slides and produces no sound. Bow hair is regularly replaced when the ribbon becomes skimpy or unbalanced from hair breakage or bow bug damage or the violinist feels the hair has \\"lost its grip.\\" Strings Coiled strings, used and new Violins have four strings, usually tuned to G, D, A, and E. The strings run from a tailpiece attached to the base, across a wooden bridge, continue towards the neck of the instrument running parallel to the fingerboard, and connect to the pegbox located at the very top of the violin. They are wound around four tuning pegs that are mounted sideways through holes in the pegbox. The bridge helps to hold the strings in place, while the pegs maintain the tension necessary to produce vibration. Strings were first made of sheep's intestines (called \\"catgut\\"), stretched, dried and twisted. Contrary to popular belief, violin strings were never made of cat's intestines. Gut strings are used in modern and \\"period\\" music, though in recent years the \\"baroque\\" historically accurate performance violinists seem to use them more often than those who play later period music or baroque music in a \\"modern\\" style. Gut strings are made by a number of specialty string makers as well as some large stringmaking companies. In the 19th century (and even earlier though not yet prevalent) metal windings were developed for the lower-pitched gut strings. Wound strings avoid the flabby sound of a light-gauge string at low tension. Heavier plain- gut strings at a suitable tension are inconvenient to play and difficult to fit into the pegbox. There are many claims made that gut strings are difficult to keep in tune. In fact for those who have experience with them, plain gut strings are quite stable from a tuning standpoint. Wound gut has more instability of tuning due to the different response to moisture and heat between the winding and the core and from string to string. Some players use olive oil on gut strings to extend their playing life and improve tuning stability by reducing their sensitivity to humidity. Gut strings tend to hold their sound quality nicely right up until they fail or become excessively worn. Modern strings are most commonly either a stranded synthetic core wound with various metals, or a steel core, which may be solid or stranded, often wound with various other metals. With low-density cores such as gut or synthetic fiber, the winding allows a string to be thin enough to play, while sounding the desired pitch at an appropriate tension. The winding of steel strings affects their flexibility and surface properties, as well as mass. Strings may be wound with several layers, in part to control the damping of vibrations, and influence the \\"warmth\\" or \\"brightness\\" of the string by manipulating the strength of its overtones. The core may be synthetic filaments, solid metal, or braided or twisted steel filaments. The uppermost E string is usually solid steel, either plain or wound with aluminium in an effort to prevent \\"whistling.\\" Gold plating delays corrosion of the steel and may also reduce whistling. Stainless steel gives a slightly different tone. Synthetic-core strings, the most popular of which is Perlon (a trade name for stranded nylon) combine some of the tonal qualities of gut strings with greater longevity and tuning stability. They are also much less sensitive to changes in humidity than gut strings, and less sensitive to changes in temperature than all-metal strings. Solid-core metal strings are stiff when newly replaced and tend to go out of tune quickly. While some gut strings still use a knot to secure the tail end in the slot of the tailpiece, most modern strings use a \\"ball\\", a small bead often made of bronze. A frequent exception is the E string, which may be had with either a ball or loop end, since the smallest E-string fine tuners hold the tail of the string on a single small hook. The price of different string types varies dramatically; gut and gut-core strings are typically the most expensive, followed by leading synthetic core brands, and student steel strings at the lowest price range. Natural gut strings (without the metal windings) are quite inexpensive, especially for the e and a strings. The longevity of strings (all types) is highly variable and influenced by style of play, chemistry of perspiration and its interaction with the string material, presence of fingernails, frequency of play etc. Some players have trouble with certain brands of strings or one particular string from a brand but not with others. The character of the sound produced by the strings can be adjusted quite markedly through the selection of different types of strings. The most noticeable divisions of sound quality for violins is steel, artificial gut (\\"perlon\\" core etc.), wound gut, and plain gut. The wound gut tend to have a mellow sound, as do many of the artificial strings, though other artificial core strings are specifically designed to be \\"bright\\". Steel and plain gut are both rather bright (full of overtones) but in distinctly different ways: It is possible to tell the difference and yet each is livelier or brighter typically than the wound soft- core and wound-gut strings. Certain styles of music have come to be played with certain types of strings, yet there is no hard and fast rule in this respect as each musician is looking for his or her sound. (Country fiddling is often on steel or all-metal; orchestral and solo is often wound (gut or artificial) with a steel e; baroque or early music may be played rather more than romantic pieces on plain gut.) Some violinists prefer to use little rubber tubes or washers towards the end of the strings which rest on the bridge to protect the bridge and also to dampen the sound. Acoustics It has been known for a long time that the shape, or arching, as well as the thickness of the wood and its physical qualities govern the sound of a violin. The sound and tone of the violin is determined by how the belly and back plates of the violin behave acoustically, according to modes or schemes of movement determined by German physicist Ernst Chladni. Patterns of the nodes (places of no movement) made by sand or glitter sprinkled on the plates with the plate vibrated at certain frequencies are called \\"Chladni patterns\\", and are occasionally used by luthiers to verify their work before assembling the instrument. A scientific explanation includes a discussion of how the properties of the wood determine where the nodes occur, whether the plates move with end or diagonally opposite points rising together or in various mixed modes. Sizes Children learning the violin often use \\"fractional- sized\\" violins: 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/10, 1/16, and sometimes even 1/32 sized instruments are used. These numbers do not represent numerically accurate size relationships, i.e., a \\"1/2 size\\" violin is not half the length of a full- sized violin. The body length (not including the neck) of a 'full-size' or 4/4 violin is 356 mm (or smaller in some models of the 17th century). A 3/4 violin is 335 mm, and a 1/2 size is 310 mm. Rarely, one finds a size referred to as 7/8 which is approximately 13.5 inches, sometimes called a \\"ladies' fiddle.\\" Viola size is specified as body length rather than fractional sizes. A 'full- size' viola averages 40 cm, but may range as long as 45 or 50 cm.

He was a pioneer in the field of laser technology and co-inventor of the charge-coupled device. As director of Space Science and Exploratory Studies at Bellcomm he helped select lunar landing sites and provided support for the Apollo space program. On October 6, 2009, it was announced that he would share the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics for \\"the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuit‚Äîthe CCD sensor, which has become an electronic eye in almost all areas of photography\\". He was appointed a Companion of the Order of Canada ‚Äî the award's highest level ‚Äî on June 30, 2010. Early Life Born in Amherst, Nova Scotia, on August 19, 1924, Boyle was the son of a medical doctor and moved to Quebec with his father and mother Bernice when he was less than two. He was home schooled by his mother until age fourteen, when he attended Montreal's Lower Canada College to complete his secondary education.  Education  Boyle attended McGill University, but his education was interrupted in 1943, when he joined the Royal Canadian Navy during World War II. He was loaned to the Royal Navy, where he was learning how to land Spitfires on aircraft carriers as the war ended. He gained a BSc in 1947, an MSc in 1948, and a PhD degree in 1950, all from McGill University.  Career  After receiving his doctorate, Boyle spent one year at Canada's Radiation Lab and two years teaching physics at the Royal Military College of Canada. = Bell Labs = In 1953 Boyle joined Bell Labs where he invented the first continuously operating ruby laser with Don Nelson in 1962, and was named on the first patent for a semiconductor injection laser. He was made director of Space Science and Exploratory Studies at the Bell Labs subsidiary Bellcomm in 1962, providing support for the Apollo space program and helping to select lunar landing sites. He returned to Bell Labs in 1964, working on the development of integrated circuits. = Invention of charge-coupled device = In 1969, Boyle and George E. Smith invented the charge-coupled device (CCD), for which they have jointly received the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1973, the 1974 IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award, the 2006 Charles Stark Draper Prize, and the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics. The CCD allowed NASA to send clear pictures to Earth back from space. It is also the technology that powers many digital cameras today. Smith said of their invention: \\"After making the first couple of imaging devices, we knew for certain that chemistry photography was dead.\\" Eugene Gordon and Mike Tompsett, two now-retired colleagues from Bell labs, claim that its application to photography was not invented by Boyle.Nobel Controversy: Former Bell Labs Employee Says He Invented the CCD Imager IEEE Boyle was Executive Director of Research for Bell Labs from 1975 until his retirement in 1979.  Personal life  In retirement he split his time between Halifax and Wallace, Nova Scotia. In Wallace, he helped launch an art gallery with his wife, Betty, a landscape artist. He was married to Betty since 1946 and had four children, 10 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren. In his later years, Boyle suffered from kidney disease, and due to complications from this disease, died in a hospital in Nova Scotia on May 7, 2011.

The film was directed by Sanjay Gupta and written by Gupta and Suresh Nair. Vishal-Shekhar composed the film's thematic music, with background music composed by Sanjoy Chowdhury. It was released in India on 12 January 2006 and was declared \\"Average\\". Zinda has been identified as an unauthorised remake of the South Korean film Oldboy (an official adaptation of the Japanese manga Old Boy).Dudrah, Rajinder and Desai, Jigna. 2008.

Synopsis Software engineer Balajeet \\"Bala\\" Roy (Sanjay Dutt), is happily married to Nisha Roy (Celina Jaitly), with whom he is having a baby. Bala is suddenly captured by unseen assailants and imprisoned in a cell. He is kept in total isolation for 14 years without knowing who imprisoned him or why. While in captivity, he practices martial arts which he learns from watching T.V., with the intention of using it against the people who captured him. He is finally released, again without explanation, and sets out for revenge. He befriends a Bangkok taxi driver named Jenny (Lara Dutta), who helps him track his kidnappers. Bala tracks down the restaurant that had served his food during his entire captivity and follows a delivery moped to his captors. Bala discovers that he was held in a private prison where people can pay to have others incarcerated. Bala tortures the owner Wong Foo (Rajendranath Zutshi) for answers by plucking out his teeth with a claw hammer; he then finds out he was imprisoned for \\"talking too much\\", and fights his way out of the building. Bala is injured during the fight, but a mysterious hooded man saves him and takes him to a taxi. The hooded man turns out to be Rohit Chopra (John Abraham). Soon Wong Foo kidnaps Jenny and tortures her. He threatens to remove Bala's teeth with his own clawhammer, but is interrupted by Rohit. Bala takes refuge with Jenny, and they have sex. Bala is informed that his daughter is alive. Bala's friend Joy (Mahesh Manjrekar) is killed, and Bala learns his kidnapper which is none other than Rohit. Rohit reveals his reason of kidnapping Bala: they went to high school together, where Bala had lusted after Rohit's elder sister Reema. After Reema rejected him, Bala spreads a false rumour that she was a whore. She became the laughing stock of their school, and committed suicide by setting herself on fire. Rohit blamed Bala for her death, and engineered his imprisonment as revenge. Rohit tells Bala that he killed Nisha, and sent his daughter, who is now 14, to a brothel. Bala beats Rohit up and knocks him off of a balcony, but grabs his hand and pleads with him to tell him where his daughter is. Defiantly, Rohit lets go of Bala's hand and falls to his death. Bala then kills Rohit's goons and Wong Foo. In the end, Bala learns that his daughter is safe; Rohit had lied to him about selling her to a brothel to torment him. He finds her sitting on a river bank, and goes to meet her. He happily lives with his daughter.

The earliest evidence for their existence is in paintings by Gaudenzio Ferrari from the 1530s, though Ferrari's instruments had only three strings. The Academie musicale, a treatise written in 1556 by Philibert Jambe de Fer, gives a clear description of the violin family much as we know it today. Violins are likely to have been developed from a number of other string instruments of the 15th and 16th centuries, including the vielle, rebec, and lira da braccio. The history of bowed string instruments in Europe goes back to the 9th century with the Byzantine lira (or l≈´rƒÅ, Greek: ŒªœçœÅŒ±). Since their invention, instruments in the violin family have seen a number of changes. The overall pattern for the instrument was set in the 17th century by luthiers like the prolific Amati family, Jakob Stainer of the Tyrol, and Antonio Stradivari, with many makers at the time and since following their templates.  Early history  The two earliest bowed instruments are the ravanastron and the omerti found in India and made of a hollowed cylinder of sycamore wood. They were played in the manner of a cello. Also in China, another two-stringed bowed instrument was the erhu. The direct ancestor of all European bowed instruments is the Arabic rebab (ÿ±ÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿ©), which developed into the Byzantine lyra by the 9th century and later the European rebec. In Welsh, the equivalent were the three- and six-strings crwths (from the 11th century). The Persian geographer Ibn Khurradadhbih (d. 911) of the 9th century was the first to cite the bowed Byzantine lyra as a typical instrument of the Byzantines and equivalent to the rabƒÅb used in the Islamic Empires of that time.Margaret J. Kartomi: On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments. Chicago Studies in Ethnomusicology, University of Chicago Press, 1990 The Byzantine lyra spread through Europe westward and in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms fiddle and lira interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2009). In the meantime rabƒÅb was introduced to the Western Europe possibly through the Iberian Peninsula and both bowed instruments spread widely throughout Europe giving birth to various European bowed instruments. During the Renaissance, the rebec came in different sizes and pitches: soprano, tenor, and bass. The smaller versions of the instrument were known in Italy as ribecchino and in France as rubechette. Over the centuries that followed, Europe continued to have two distinct types of bowed instruments: one, relatively square-shaped, held in the arms, known with the Italian term lira da braccio (meaning 'viol for the arm') family; the other, with sloping shoulders and held between the knees, known with the Italian term lira da gamba (or viola da gamba, meaning 'viol for the leg') group.stringed instrument. (2009). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved March 14, 2009, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/569200/stringed-instrument (Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2009) During the Renaissance the gambas were important and elegant instruments. The very successful family of fretted viols appeared in Europe only few years before the violin. They eventually lost ground to the louder (and originally viewed as less aristocratic) lira da braccio family of the modern violin.  Emergence  Gaudenzio Ferrari's \\"Madonna of the Orange Trees\\", from 1529‚Äì30. Bottom, left of centre, is an infant playing a three-stringed violin. The cupola of Madonna dei Miracoli in Saronno , with angels playing violin, viola and cello. The first clear record of a violin-like instrument comes from paintings by Gaudenzio Ferrari. In his Madonna of the Orange Tree, painted 1530, a cherub is seen playing a bowed instrument which clearly has the hallmarks of violins. A few years later, on a fresco in the cupola of the church of Madonna dei Miracoli in Saronno, angels play three instruments of the violin family, corresponding to violin, viola and cello. The instruments depicted by Ferrari have bulging front and back plates, strings that feed into peg-boxes with side pegs, and f-holes. They do not have frets. The only real difference between those instruments and the modern violin is that Ferrari's have three strings and a rather more extravagant curved shape.Boyden, p. 6-8 It is not clear exactly who made the first violins, but there is good evidence that they originate from northern Italy, near (and theb the political orbit) of Milan. Not only are Ferrari's paintings in that area but also towns like Brescia and Cremona then had a great reputation for the craftsmanship of stringed instruments. The earliest documentary evidence for a violin is in the records of the treasury of Savoy, which paid for \\"trompettes et vyollons de Verceil\\", that is to say, \\"trumpets and violins from Vercelli\\", the town where Ferrari painted his Madonna of the Orange Tree. The first extant written use of the Italian term violino occurs in 1538, when \\"violini Milanesi\\" (Milanese violinists) were brought to Nice when negotiating the conclusion of a war.Boyden, p.21-28 The violin quickly became very popular, both among street-musicians and the nobility, which is illustrated by the fact that Charles IX of France commissioned an extensive range of string instruments in the second half of the 16th century.Violin - History and Repertory to 1600 - (v) Authenticity and Surviving instruments, Grove Music Online, Accessed 14 November 2006. (subscription required) Around 1555, the French court imported a dance band of Italian violinists and in 1573, during one of Catherine de Medici's celebration \\"the music was the most melodious one had ever seen and the ballet was accompanied by some thirty violins playing very pleasantly a warlike tune,\\" wrote an observer. The oldest confirmed surviving violin, dated inside, is the \\"Charles IX\\" by Andrea Amati, made in Cremona in 1564, but the label is very doubtful. The Metropolitan Museum of Art has an Amati violin that may be even older, possibly dating to 1558 but just like the Charles IX the date is unconfirmed. One of the most famous and certainly the most pristine is the Messiah Stradivarius (also known as the 'Salabue') made by Antonio Stradivari in 1716 and very little played, perhaps almost never and in an as new state. It is now located in the Ashmolean Museum of Oxford.  Early makers  Instruments of approximately 300 years of age, especially those made by Stradivari and Guarneri del Ges√π, are the most sought-after, by both performers and (generally wealthier) collectors. In addition to the skill and reputation of the maker, an instrument's age can also influence both price and quality. The violin has 70 parts, actually 72 if top and bottom plates are each made from two pieces of wood. Each of the separate parts is indispensable. The most famous violin makers, between the early 16th century and the 18th century included: * Micheli family of Italian violin makers, Zanetto Micheli 1490 - 1560, Pellegrino Micheli 1520 - 1607, Giovanni Micheli 1562 - 1616, Francesco Micheli 1579 - 1615, and the brother in law Battista Doneda 1529 - 1610 * Bertolotti da Sal√≤ (Gasparo da Sal√≤) family of Italian violin and double bass players and makers: Francesco 1513 - 1563 and Agostino 1510 - 1584 Bertolotti, Gasparo Bertolotti 1540 - 1609 called Gasparo da Sal√≤ * Giovanni Paolo Maggini 1580 - 1630 pupil of Gasparo da Sal√≤ * Giovanni Battista Rogeri 1642-1710 * Amati family of Italian violin makers, Andrea Amati (1500‚Äì1577), Antonio Amati (1540‚Äì1607), Hieronymous Amati I (1561‚Äì1630), Nicolo Amati (1596‚Äì1684), Hieronymous Amati II (1649‚Äì1740) * Guarneri family of Italian violin makers, Andrea Guarneri (1626‚Äì1698), Pietro of Mantua (1655‚Äì1720), Giuseppe Giovanni Battista Guarneri (Joseph filius Andreae) (1666‚Äì1739), Pietro Guarneri (of Venice) (1695‚Äì1762), and Giuseppe Guarneri (del Gesu) (1698‚Äì1744) * Antonio Stradivari (1644‚Äì1737) of Cremona, Italy. * Rugeri family of violin makers of Cremona, Italy. Francesco Rugeri (1628-1698), and Vincenzo Rugeri (1663-1719). * Carlo Bergonzi (luthier) (1683-1747) of Cremona, Italy. * Jacob Stainer (1617‚Äì1683) of Absam in Tyrol An intricately carved 17th century (circa 1660) British Royal Family violin, on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.  Transition from Baroque to modern form  Between the 16th and 19th centuries, several changes occurred, including: * The fingerboard was made a little longer to be able to play even the highest notes (in the 19th century). * The fingerboard was tilted a little more, to produce even more volume as larger and larger orchestras became popular. * Nearly all old instruments were modified, including lengthening of the neck by one centimeter, in response to the raising of pitch that occurred in the 19th century. * The bass bar of nearly all old instruments was made heavier to allow a greater string tension. * The classical luthiers \\"nailed\\" and glued the instrument necks to the upper block of the body before gluing on the soundboard, while later luthiers mortise the neck to the body after completely assembling the body. * The chinrest was invented in the early 19th century by Louis Spohr. The results of these adjustments are instruments that are significantly different in sound and response from those that left the hands of their makers. Regardless, most violins nowadays are built superficially resembling the old instruments.  Trade violins  In the 19th and 20th centuries numerous violins were produced in France, Saxony and the Mittenwald in what is now Germany, in the Tyrol, now parts of Austria and Italy, and in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. About seven million violin family instruments and basses, and far more bows, were shipped from Markneukirchen between 1880 and 1914. Many 19th and early 20th century instruments shipped from Saxony were in fact made in Bohemia, where the cost of living was less. While the French workshops in Mirecourt employed hundreds of workers, the Saxon/Bohemian instruments were made by a cottage industry of \\"mostly anonymous skilled laborers quickly turning out a simple, inexpensive product.\\" Today this market also sees instruments coming from China, Romania, and Bulgaria.  Recent inventions  More recently, the Stroh violin used mechanical amplification similar to that of an unelectrified gramophone to boost sound volume. Some Stroh violins have a small \\"monitor\\" horn pointed at the player's ear, for audibility on a loud stage, where the main horn points at the audience. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries before electronic sound amplification became common, Stroh violins were used particularly in the recording studio. These violins with directional horns better suited the demands of the early recording industry's technology than the traditional violin. Stroh was not the only person who made instruments of this class. Over twenty different inventions appear in the Patent books up to 1949. Often mistaken for Stroh and interchangeably known as being Stroh-viols, phono-fiddles, horn-violins or trumpet-violins, these other instruments have slipped into comparative obscurity. The history of the electric violin spans the entire 20th century. The success of electrical amplification, recording and playback devices brought an end to the use of the Stroh violin in broadcast and recording. Acoustic-electric violins have a hollow body with soundholes, and may be played with or without amplification. Solid-body electric violins produce very little sound on their own, and require the use of an electronic sound reinforcement system, which usually includes equalization and may also apply sonic effects. Electric violins may have four strings, or as many as seven strings. Since the strength of materials imposes limits on the upper string, it is usually tuned to E5, with additional strings tuned in fifths below the usual G3 of a typical four-string violin. The five- string electric violin shown in the gallery below was built by John Jordan in the early 21st century, and is tuned C G D A E.

The tone of the violin stands out above other instruments, making it appropriate for playing a melody line. In the hands of an adept player, the violin is extremely agile, and can execute rapid and difficult sequences of notes. The violin is also considered a very expressive instrument, which is often felt to approximate the human voice. This may be due to the possibility of vibrato and of slight expressive adjustments in pitch and timbre. Many leading composers have contributed to the violin concerto and violin sonata repertories. Violins make up a large part of an orchestra, and are usually divided into two sections, known as the first and second violins. Composers often assign the melody to the first violins (who are often given more technically difficult music), while second violins play harmony, accompaniment patterns or the melody in a lower range than the first violins. A string quartet similarly has parts for first and second violins, as well as a viola part, and a bass instrument, such as the cello or, rarely, the double bass. Popular music During the 1920s and early-1930s, violins were an integral part of popular music, especially for dance music. Dances orchestras typically had at least 2 or 3 violins, although high class society orchestras would often include as many as 6 or 7. With the introduction of swing music in 1935, the violin, along with other string instruments, dropped out of popular music as they were deemed inappropriate for the swing sound. Violins would only re-emerge in popular music in the late-1960s. While the violin has had very little usage in rock music compared to its brethren the guitar and bass guitar, it is being increasingly absorbed into mainstream pop. Independent artists such as Final Fantasy and Andrew Bird have increased interest as well, creating a subcategory of indie rock that some have termed \\"violindie\\". The violin is also used in mainstream pop acts like Vanessa-Mae, Bond, Miri Ben-Ari, Yellowcard, Nigel Kennedy, and Dave Matthews Band with Boyd Tinsley and Jean-Luc Ponty; U2 also frequently uses the violin, especially the electric violin. The violin is also a part of the huge phenomenon called cello rock. The hugely popular Motown recordings of the 1960s and 1970s relied heavily on strings as part of the trademark texture. Earlier genres of pop music, at least those separate from the Rock 'n' Roll movement, tended to make use of fairly traditional Orchestras, sometimes large ones; examples include the American \\"Crooners\\" such as Bing Crosby. Though bowed strings were heavily popular and relied upon in almost all types of music genre recordings in the 1960s and 1970s, disco music, which surged aggressively onto the music scene in the early to mid-1970s, also relied heavily upon strings within its compositions; in fact, almost all disco/dance music of that era incorporated the use of strings within its compositions and arrangements. When the sudden decline of disco began in the early-1980s, the use of strings not only dwindled in disco music, but ceased in almost all types of popular music during that time and more so immediately after disco's decline in relative popularity. The 1980s saw an insurgence of electronic music mimicking strings with little or no use of traditional strings in music compositions. Now strings are making a comeback in pop music. Indian, Pakistani, Turkish and Arabic pop music is filled with the sound of violins, both soloists and ensembles.  Jazz  The earliest references to jazz performance using the violin as a solo instrument are documented during the first decades of the 20th century. The first great jazz violinist was Eddie South who is best known as the Dark Angel Of Violin. In the swing and post-war eras there were many superb improvising violinists including St√©phane Grappelli, Stuff Smith, Ray Perry, Ray Nance and Claude \\"Fiddler\\" Williams. =Modern jazz, 1961-present= Noteworthy modern jazz violinists who joined the scene between 1960 and 1990 and usually played in an avant-garde vein include Didier Lockwood, Leroy Jenkins, Billy Bang, Malcolm Goldstein, Michael White, John Blake, Jr., and Florin Niculescu. Younger performers include Mat Maneri, Katt Hernandez and Regina Carter. Jazz fusion violinists include Jean- Luc Ponty and Michal Urbaniak. Folk music Like many other instruments of classical music, the violin descends from remote ancestors, cruder in form, that were used for folk music. Following a stage of intensive development in the late Renaissance, largely in Italy, the violin had improved (in volume, tone, and agility), to the point that it not only became a very important instrument in art music, but proved highly appealing to folk musicians as well. As a folk instrument, the violin ultimately spread very widely, sometimes displacing earlier bowed instruments, and ethnomusicologists have observed its use in many locations throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas. In many traditions of folk music, the tunes are not written but are memorized by successive generations of musicians and passed on in what is known as the oral tradition. Fiddle When played as a folk instrument, the violin is ordinarily referred to in English as a fiddle. One difference between fiddles and ordinary violins may be seen in American (e.g., bluegrass and old-time music) fiddling. In these styles, the bridge is sometimes shaved down so that it is slightly less curved. This reduces the range of motion needed for shuffle bowings which alternate between pairs of strings. There is quite often only a single fiddle playing in any given venue, although twin fiddling is represented in some styles. By contrast, violins often play in sections ‚Äì several individuals playing the same instrument, typically in a symphony orchestra ‚Äì since sound reinforcement (before electronic amplification) was only possible by adding more instruments. The Italian term ripieno may be translated as filling (or \\"stuffing\\" in the culinary sense), since multiple instruments \\"fill out\\" the sound. Indian classical music The Indian violin, while essentially the same instrument as that used in Western music, is different in some senses. The instrument is tuned so that the IV and III strings (G and D on a western-tuned violin) and the II and I (A and E) strings are sa-pa (do-sol) pairs and sound the same but are offset by an octave, resembling common scordatura or fiddle cross-tunings such as CGCG or AEAE. The tonic sa (do) is not fixed, but variably tuned to accommodate the vocalist or lead player. The way the musician holds the instrument varies from Western to Indian music. In Indian music the musician sits on the floor cross-legged with the right foot out in front of them. The scroll of the instrument rests on the foot. This position is essential to playing well due to the nature of Indian music. The hand can move all over the fingerboard and there is no set position for the left hand, so it is important for the violin to be in a steady, unmoving position. The violin is a very important part of Indian classical music. It is believed to have been introduced to the Indian tradition by Baluswamy Dikshitar brother of Muthuswami Dikshitar. The violin is primarily used as support for a vocalist, as the sound of a violin complements that of the singer, but is also largely played solo. In solo violin concerts, the violinist is accompanied by percussion instruments, usually the tabla, the mridangam and the ghatam. The violin is also a principal instrument for Indian film music. V. S. Narasimhan is among the leading players in the South Indian film industry, with many hits in the film world.

His cognomen, molt, means \\"ram\\" but its origin is unknown. Family Ailill was said to be the son of Nath √ç and Ethne ingen Chonrach Cais. His paternal grandfather Fiachrae is called a brother of Niall of the Nine Hostages. Ailill thus belonged to the Connachta, a kindred united by supposed descent from Conn of the Hundred Battles, which included the U√≠ N√©ill, the U√≠ Bri√∫in and, named for Ailill's grandfather, the U√≠ Fiachrach. Although Ailill's descendants are not reckoned High Kings of Ireland, his grandson E√≥gan B√©l and great-grandson Ailill Inbanda are counted as Kings of Connacht. Ailill's son Mac Ercae may have been an important historical figure, but the record conflates Mac Ercae mac Ailello Muilt and the U√≠ N√©ill king Muirchertach mac Muiredaig, called Muirchertach Mac Ercae, probably confusing events beyond recovery. Historicity The broad agreement of generally pro-U√≠ N√©ill sources that Ailill was High King is offered as proof that this was the case. Although the chronology of 5th century High Kings has been the subject of manipulation, it is seen as unlikely that later historians and genealogists would have added a non-U√≠ N√©ill king had the belief that Ailill was king not been widespread. Ailill is said to have become High King following the supernatural death of L√≥egaire mac N√©ill, supposedly c. 463. The Irish annals contain many references to him, but most of these are taken to be late additions, or come from the now lost Book of Cuanu, extracts of which are preserved in the Annals of Ulster. Tradition has him killed in battle at Faughan Hill, fighting against the sons of Niall. The king lists say that he was succeeded by Lugaid mac L√≥egairi. Opposing the view that Ailill was included as a High King from the earliest times, Thomas Charles-Edwards suggests that the inclusion of Nath √ç and Ailill Molt was a means to reinforce links between the U√≠ N√©ill and the other branches of the Connachta in the late 7th or 8th centuries, when he presumes the king lists and the annals related to Saint Patrick to have been collected and edited. This is offered without giving undue support to any contemporary claims by the other Connachta kindreds, the U√≠ Ailello and, in particular, the powerful U√≠ Bri√∫in, to the High Kingship.

The battle was fought on 20 February 1499, a cold and foggy day, between 10,000 Imperial troops, mostly from the Swabian Circles, and a smaller number of Swiss troops, often called Reisl√§ufer. The battle took place in the westernmost part of modern-day Austria, in the vicinity of the southeast corner of Lake Constance, roughly southwest of the town of Bregenz. The Imperial army had deployed its advance guard between the towns of Lustenau and H√∂chst, south of the lake town of Hard. On the morning of the battle the Imperial advance guard discovered the advanced guard of the invading Swiss army marching down the right bank of the Rhine, attacked it, and caused it to recoil toward Hard. The surprised Imperials, alerted to the Swiss attack, hastily deployed themselves into battle order near the town of Lauterach and set up their artillery. The Swiss main body had meanwhile arrived in the area of battle, and skillfully deployed its attack columns so as to deny the Imperials the maximum benefit of their artillery superiority. Both armies were composed primarily of infantry, many of whom were armed with a very long spear called a spiess (pike), others with a pole weapon called a halberd. These would be deployed in very deep infantry combat columns. Smaller bodies of men would skirmish around these columns, firing with crossbows or primitive muzzle-loading firearms called the arquebus. The Imperial army had an artillery train and a small force of armoured knights, although it is not known whether these fought on horseback, or, as was often their custom, on foot amongst the infantry pike columns. The Swiss attack columns precipitously attacked the Imperial positions, staggered under the weight of the defensive fire from the Imperial artillery, but, propelled forward by their serious warfighting ethos, kept up the assault. Colliding with the Imperial infantry columns, the Swiss rapidly threw the Swabian forces into disorder, then rout. The Swabians were unable to mount a fighting withdrawal, and as a result, many fleeing troops were massacred by the Swiss, as was their custom. The Swabian soldiers were aware of this custom, and a panic ensued. Some Imperial troops fled to Bregenz, others attempted to board three nearby ships, which overturned in the chaos and sank, drowning many of the fleeing infantry and knights. Others sought hiding places where they could, and, ill-equipped to overnight in the prevailing terrible cold, died of exposure. Although the victorious Swiss performed at best a sloppy pursuit, focusing more on pillaging than on a systematic pursuit (another of their customs), by the end of the battle several thousand Swabian corpses nonetheless littered the battlefield, and were eventually buried in a mass grave outside the Chapel of Hard.

The presidents at the time were N√©stor Kirchner (Argentina) and Tabar√© V√°zquez (Uruguay). As a diplomatic, economic, and public relations conflict between both parties, the dispute also affected tourism and transportation as well as the otherwise amicable relations between the two countries. The feud was unprecedented between the two countries, which have shared historical and cultural ties.\\"Argentine blockade irks neighbours\\" Proceedings were brought before the International Court of Justice as a case formally named Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay).International Court of Justice docket: Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay) It ruled that, although Uruguay failed to inform Argentina of the operations, it did not pollute the river, so closing the pulp mill would be unjustified. The conflict ended in 2010, during the presidencies of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner (Argentina) and Jos√© Mujica (Uruguay), with the establishment of a joint coordination of the activities in the river. Origin of the dispute After twenty years of forest industry development, in October 2003, the Spanish company ENCE, received permission from the Uruguayan government to build a pulp mill in Fray Bentos, on the Uruguay River (which forms the natural border north between Brazil and Argentina and in the south between Uruguay and Argentina). Argentines residing mainly in Gualeguaych√∫, Entre R√≠os, about 35 km from Fray Bentos, had been concerned that ENCE's pulp mill would pollute the river. Also, some demonstrations had been organized against ENCE. After ENCE received its permit, another company, the Finnish Botnia, made public their intention to consider the same area for another pulp mill. Botnia received the environmental authorization to build a mill in February 2005. The Uruguay River is shared by the two countries and is protected by a treaty, which requires both parties to inform the other of any project that might affect the river. Besides the issue of pollution, Argentina claimed that the Uruguayan government had not asked for permission to build the mills. Uruguayan authorities countered that the Treaty did not require that permission be obtained, but merely that the other part be appropriately informed, and that conversations had indeed been held and filed, without objections on the Argentine part. In addition, they claimed that the technology used in the mills would avoid polluting the river to the extent claimed by Argentines, and that more modern wastewater treatment would have a beneficial effect when used for local sewage treatment as well. Before the construction of the mill, sewage from the city of Fray Bentos was discharged to the river untreated. These claims were backed by neutral expert statements given to the IFC.Botnia willing to contribute in improving the Rio Uruguay river water ‚Äì Press release by Mets√§-Botnia. The first protests The conflict area On 30 April 2005, just two months after President Vazquez and his government took power in Uruguay and two months after the mills were publicly approved, a large group of 10,000‚Äì20,000 people (residents of Gualeguaych√∫ and nearby, as well as environmental groups from Argentina) blocked the international Libertador General San Mart√≠n Bridge (between Gualeguaych√∫ and Fray Bentos) protesting the installation of the pulp mills. These demonstrations were organized by the Environmental Assembly of Gualeguaych√∫ and the goal was to bring attention to possible negative effects that the mills could bring to the environment. The people who participated in these demonstrations hoped that by bringing attention to the conflict, the construction of the mills would be interrupted. If this was not feasible they hoped that, at the very least, the actions taken by the mills would be changed so that the environment, specifically the river, would not be negatively affected. Demonstrators did not allow any cars to get through the bridge. The only vehicles that could drive through it were cars and trucks from farms, as well as Uruguayans who regularly shopped in Argentina due good exchange rates. However, these Uruguayans would have to park their vehicles near the roadblock and walk through the demonstration and people before they could get in a rental car that drove them to the markets. Protesters agreed that Uruguayan shoppers were allowed to walk through the demonstration safely and without maltreatment. Furthermore, their vehicles were not attacked. In September 2005, the Center for Human Rights and Environment (CEDHA)CEDHA filed a complaint to the Compliance Advisory Ombudsman (CAO) of the World Bank (which oversees IFC project compliance with social and environmental norms). The CAO eventually released two reports, a preliminary report and an audit. The audit report was critical of the procedures the IFC followed pertaining to the project. A draft cumulative impact study of the two mills by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank was released on 19 December. According to it, the technical requirements of the mills had been fulfilled and the quality of the water and the air in the region should not be harmed. The IFC said it would wait for further consultations to be made before finalizing the study and thus before financing the projects. On 23 December, about 50 Gualeguaych√∫ residents again blocked Route 136 and the General San Mart√≠n Bridge, using rubble, logs and vehicles. The block, slated for 8 a.m., started at 5 a.m., angering many drivers who were forced to take a detour to the next bridge, which goes from Col√≥n to Paysand√∫. Later this bridge was blocked as well. Many Argentines usually travel to Uruguay in the summer, beginning immediately before Christmas. Legal and diplomatic escalation A sign against the paper mills in a shop in Gualeguaych√∫ On 26 December, the Uruguayan chancellor Reinaldo Gargano accused Argentina of violating Mercosur regulations on freedom of circulation of goods, and spoke to Argentine chancellor Jorge Taiana, requesting that measures be taken to avoid harming the tourist season. A few hours later, Argentina ratified the protest, asked to suspend the factories' construction, and threatened to make the matter a legal conflict. The Citizens' Environmental Assembly of Gualeguaych√∫ simultaneously blocked the three bridges that link the province of Entre R√≠os with Uruguay on 30 December 2005. The following days saw intermittent blockades and protests, with volunteers handing pamphlets and explaining the passers-by the reasons for their rejection of the paper factories. Argentine Head of Environmental Affairs, Ra√∫l Estrada Oyuela, went on record proposing to boycott the production of the mills. On 2 January 2006 the Uruguayan government rejected this forcefully. The municipal intendant of R√≠o Negro Department, Omar Lafluf, said that most Uruguayans supported the factories; a survey released on 5 January showed that only 16% were against them. At this point, Greenpeace activists met with Uruguayan officials to request suspension of the works. The Uruguayan government prepared a pamphlet to be handed out to Argentine tourists, informing them of the technical aspects of environmental safety of the factories. The roadblocks soon became scheduled events. Greenpeace later refused to take any further action, claiming that as long as Botnia does not pollute the river and follows the same conditions requested to build and run a mill of this sort in Europe, there is no problem with the pulp mill at all. Chile became indirectly involved, as several Chilean trucks carrying equipment and materials for the Botnia project across Argentina were detained by the roadblocks before they could cross the border to Uruguay near the end of their journey. Responding to a request by governor Busti, on 25 January 2006 the Argentine national government announced it would take the issue to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, accusing Uruguay of violating the bilateral Treaty of Uruguay River dealing with the conservation of the Uruguay River; Uruguay's chancellor Gargano called this \\"a grave step\\" which bypassed and ignored the institutions of the Mercosur, and said Uruguay would protest the lack of action of the Argentine government with regards to the roadblocks at the Controversy Resolution Tribunal of Asunci√≥n. On 30 January the High Level Technical Group (Grupo T√©cnico de Alto Nivel, GTAN), a joint Argentine- Uruguayan commission for the study of the impact of the paper factories, ended deliberations with the two countries issuing separate statements. The Argentine Foreign Ministry accused the Uruguayan members of GTAN of withholding information, which the Uruguayan officials denied. The GTAN had met 180 days before, as mandated by the Uruguay River Statute. The government of Entre R√≠os, in the meantime, distributed 100,000 pamphlets about the paper factories and their alleged impact among those attending the Cosqu√≠n music festival in C√≥rdoba, which ended on 29 January. February 2006 On 6 February 2006 Uruguayan President Tabar√© V√°zquez acknowledged that he had spoken on the phone to Argentine President N√©stor Kirchner the previous week, in order to look for a solution of the conflict. Regardless, he also announced that in any event the construction of the mills would not be halted by the Uruguayan government. On 3 February 2006 members of the Gualeguaych√∫ Environmental Assembly had started a long-term blockade of Route 136, leading to the Libertador General San Mart√≠n Bridge and to Fray Bentos. Several votes were taken on the issue, in every case resolving to maintain the blockade. At the beginning of the blockade, Jorge Eduardo Lozano, designated bishop of Gualeguaych√∫, stated that he supported the protesters because theirs was \\"a just cause\\", though he also spoke of the need to look for \\"reasonable alternatives\\". The archbishop of Montevideo, Nicol√°s Cotugno, offered to mediate. In the meantime, the citizens of Gualeguaych√∫, after an assembly, rejected the mediation of Nobel Peace Prize-winner Adolfo P√©rez Esquivel; he had asked them to end the blockades while talks were conducted. On 12 February about 400 people, gathered by the Col√≥n Environmental Assembly, went in nearly 100 vehicles from Col√≥n (100 km north of Gualeguaych√∫) to the international General Artigas Bridge, demonstrating there and creating a traffic disruption. This temporal measure was followed, on 16 February, by a blockade of Route 135 and the bridge, which links Col√≥n with Paysand√∫ in Uruguay. All these earlier actions were targeted to impact the public hearings of Cumulative Impact Study, held by IFC on 14 and 16 in both Montevideo and Buenos Aires. On 20 February the Uruguayan government decided to accuse Argentina before the Organization of American States, for its lack of action on the matter of the blocks. The same day, the Supreme Court of Argentina rejected the case presented by Argentines against Uruguay, returning it to Guillermo Quadrini, federal judge of Concepci√≥n del Uruguay. The School of Chemistry of the University of the Republic, Uruguay, released an open letter to Uruguayan society on 22 February. They reported that TCF-derived paper can be recycled fewer times than ECF-derived paper. The TCF process is 5% more expensive, and needs 10% more fuel and wood to make the same amount of paper than ECF process; therefore, it releases 10% more greenhouse gases. The letter stated that ECF and TCF are accepted as \\"best available technologies\\" in developed countries, and toxic emissions are minimal (specially dioxins), which implies that emissions depend on management and controls, not on whether TCF or ECF processes are used. March 2006 The conflict is generally covered by main newspapers. During their state visits to Chile on 11 March for the inauguration of President Michelle Bachelet, Presidents N√©stor Kirchner and Tabar√© V√°zquez met and discussed the situation personally. They jointly asked the participants for the suspension of both the construction of the pulp mills and the roadblocks, in order to discuss the matter. Two new meetings were scheduled, to take place in Anchorena, Uruguay, and Mar del Plata, Argentina. In the following days President V√°zquez was harshly criticised by the political opposition and backtracked publicly, stating that Uruguay \\"will not negotiate under pressure\\". The Gualeguaych√∫ Environmental Assembly met with Governor Busti to hear the proposal, but then decided to keep the blockade for the moment and reconsider. On 16 March about 10,000 people demonstrated in Fray Bentos, Uruguay for the pulp mills. =Gualeguaych√∫ lifts the blockade= The Assembly gathered again, with an unusually large attendance, on 20 March. After discussing several proposals, they voted to lift the blockades on Route 136 and the Libertador General San Mart√≠n Bridge (which had lasted 45 days), starting the following day, and wait 7 days for the Uruguayan government to reciprocate (suspending the construction of the mills in order to discuss). Uruguayan Chancellor Gargano had previously stated that freeing the roads was a sine qua non condition to start negotiations. The Environmental Assembly of Col√≥n, on the other hand, decided to continue blocking Route 135 and the international pass over the General Artigas Bridge, 80 km north of Gualeguaych√∫. =Suspension of works= On 26 March, one of the companies building the pulp mills, Botnia, announced that it would suspend the installation works for 90 days \\"in order to contribute to the opening of dialogue and answering to the request of Presidents Tabar√© V√°zquez and N√©stor Kirchner.\\" Botnia is so far the largest private investment in the history of Uruguay, and it had completed 45% of the project, but not started the mills themselves. The news caused concern among European stockholders. ENCE, whose construction had not yet started at all, also informally agreed to suspend the works. Soon afterwards, the ombudsman of the World Bank, Meg Taylor, concluded that the review carried out by the IFC about the pulp mills had been \\"incomplete\\" and its procedures not rigorous enough. These conclusions were delivered to the government of Entre R√≠os, which in turn passed them on to President Kirchner to be analyzed in the upcoming presidential meeting in Colonia, Uruguay. On 30 March, Botnia sent the construction workers union (SUNCA) a communique which stated that the suspension had been revised and work should continue normally. The company would halt the works for only ten days. When this was confirmed, the Colonia meeting, which had been postponed once already, was cancelled. On 5 April, after deliberations, the Gualeguaych√∫ Assembly resumed the blockade of Route 136. April 2006 The relationship between the political actors of both countries became tense after the resumption of the blockade. Catholic Church leaders in both vowed to facilitate the dialogue (though specifically not to act as mediators). The governments of Finland and Spain denied the possibility of intervening in the affairs involving Botnia and ENCE. The Finnish Minister of Foreign Trade and Cooperation for Development, Paula Lehtom√§ki, cancelled a visit to Argentina citing a concern that she might not be welcome, and stated that the conflict was to be solved among Argentina, Uruguay and the two private companies. Uruguay threatened to resort to the World Trade Organization, since the blockades \\"violate basic principles of international commerce\\" and were not cleared by the Argentine authorities, thus causing an economic loss to Uruguay (which they estimated at $400 million). The Uruguayan government also considered a demand on the International Court of Justice, claiming that the blockades have violated human rights by preventing the free circulation of persons and goods. During an official visit to Mexico, Uruguayan president Tabar√© V√°zquez said that \\"while leaders are talking about an integration process, one of these countries\\" (Argentina) \\"is discriminating against another one with a blockade.\\" He added that that was \\"a policy of disintegration\\", and proposed, once more, to discuss the issue using Mercosur's established institutions. May ‚Äì July 2006 On 3 May Argentina formally presented its complaint before the International Court of Justice, accusing Uruguay of violating of the Uruguay River Statute by authorizing the construction of the mills without prior consultation with Argentina. Evangelina Carrozzo On 11 May, at the opening of the European Union, Latin America and Caribbean Business Summit in Vienna, President Kirchner gave a speech reiterating the accusations against Uruguay, and also accused the developed countries of applying a double standard with respect to pollution controls. The presidents' official photo shooting was briefly interrupted by the presence of the Queen of the Carnival of Gualeguaych√∫, 26-year-old Evangelina Carrozzo, who had entered the event along with a Greenpeace activist, both with press passes obtained by a weekly newspaper of Mor√≥n, Buenos Aires whose director has collaborated with environmentalists before. As the shooting was about to begin, Carrozzo swiftly took off her overcoat (leaving her wearing only a tasselled bikini), produced a paper banner that read \\"No pulpmill pollution\\" in Spanish and English, and paraded with it before the 58 heads of state, before being taken away by security. On 17 May 150 members of the Gualeguaych√∫ Environmental Assembly travelled to Buenos Aires and, together with Carrozzo and some 200 local activists, they demonstrated in front of the embassies of Finland and Sweden. Jukka Uosukainen, head of the International Relations of the Finnish Environment Ministry, acknowledged concerns that the conflict is harming the country's reputation on environmental issues, and said that Argentine officials were invited to visit pulp mills in Finland but they refused. On 27 June, environmental activist Romina Picolotti was appointed to preside the Argentine Secretariat of Environment and Sustainable Development. Picolotti, a lawyer who founded and presided the Center for Human Rights and Environment (CEDHA), used to counsel not only the Gualeguaych√∫ Assembly, but also Entre R√≠os governor Busti. The CEDHA, now presided by Picolotti's husband Daniel Taillant, provided legal advice to the Argentine case at the ICJ, and later organized a tour of several countries to raise international awareness of the pulp mills and present arguments against their construction. =The case at the ICJ= Argentina sued Uruguay in the International Court of Justice, arguing that it had breached a treaty obligation to consult before doing anything that might affect the river. However, in July the court rejected its request for an injunction to stop construction of the mills. Uruguay took its case to Mercosur, arguing that Argentina had failed to take action to ensure the free circulation of goods and services. During their defense at the ICJ, the Uruguayan authorities pointed to the fact that the mills were to use a technology known as Elemental Chlorine-Free (or ECF) bleaching (employing chlorine dioxide), which has been adopted by both the United States and the European Union as the \\"best available technology\\" in their wood pulp processing environmental regulations, and that an independent World Bank study has supported their position. As to the alleged violation of the Treaty of the Uruguay River, Uruguay's legal defense team asserted that discussions over the building of the mills were conducted, and that Argentine officials offered no objections. After two months of calm while the International Court of Justice in The Hague studied the Argentine accusation, the conflict was re-ignited on 13 July, when the ICJ ruled that Argentina had not convinced the court that Uruguay's actions at present were enough to grant a provisional measure halting the construction of the two pulp mills. This judgment did not settle the question of whether Uruguay is ultimately breaching its Treaty obligations to Argentina, but ruled that no imminent danger of irreparable damage exists at the moment, and that Uruguay may still be liable to Argentina if it is later found in the final judgment that Uruguay is indeed in breach of Treaty obligations. Judges at the ICJ voted 14‚Äì1 in Uruguay's favour (the only vote against Uruguay was cast by the judge appointed by Argentina). The next day, the Gualeguaych√∫ Assembly organized a protest demonstration, with cars, bicycles and people on foot marching along National Route 14 and finally gathering in the city. According to Assembly leaders, new road blockades will be avoided, at least until the summer. A similar but smaller protest march took place in Col√≥n. August ‚Äì September 2006 On 6 August 2006, taking advantage of the high circulation of vehicles due to the winter vacations, residents of Concepci√≥n del Uruguay, Gualeguaych√∫, Col√≥n and other towns, along with some Uruguayan families, handed out flyers to drivers along National Route 14, to raise awareness about the risks of pollution and inform them about their demands. Traffic was slowed down, but not blocked. =Uruguay's demands before the MERCOSUR Tribunal= Starting in June, Uruguay demanded before the Mercosur Tribunal that Argentina be punished for the blockades, and that it be forced to pay reparations, following the Treaty of Asunci√≥n, which guarantees the free circulation of goods and services between Mercosur members. On 9 August, Uruguayan representatives presented their claims, centered in two points: first, that the blockades during the summer had caused grave economic damage to Uruguay (calculated in $400 million losses); and second, that the Argentine government did not act to prevent or lift the blockades. Argentine witnesses testified, instead, that the Kirchner administration did have an active stance and tried to soften the effects of the blockades, and showed that there had been a 33% increase in the bilateral trade between the period January‚ÄìMay 2005 and the same period of 2006 despite the blocks. Uruguay also demanded that the Argentine government be forced to act in case of future blockades. The Argentine Foreign Relations Ministry was reportedly confident that the tribunal would not heed such demands, since hypothetical future violations are not subject to it, according to jurisprudence, and moreover, that the tribunal's dictates would remain symbolical, given that the blockades were discontinued, even before Uruguay's demands were presented. The tribunal, an ad hoc assembly formed by three arbiters (one Argentine, one Uruguayan and one Spanish) gathered in Asunci√≥n, heard the allegations and, on 7 September, ruled that Argentina had acted \\"on good faith\\", and rejected the request for monetary sanctions, but it noted the blockades had caused \\"undeniable inconveniences to both Uruguayan and Argentine trade, in addition the violation of the free circulation right.\\" Both governments acknowledged the tribunal's report as positive to their respective causes. =ENCE cancels Fray Bentos project= On 20 September 2006, the management of ENCE's mill dismissed 40 of its employees. The implicit cancellation of the project was confirmed the next day, when the company's president Juan Luis Arregui announced that the construction of the Fray Bentos mill (some earthworks only started) would not be continued, though there are plans to relocate the project to another region in Uruguay. Arregui also said that they \\"might have made a mistake\\" and explained why, in his view, \\"there cannot be two [pulp] mills in Fray Bentos.\\"Office of the President of Uruguay. Press conference by Luis Arregui . According to Arregui, Fray Bentos lacks sufficient infrastructure to support the lorries needed. However, ENCE has known for years that its factory would be just from the one being built by Botnia and, as of May 2006, it was still vowing that it would never move from the riverside site. Arregui was known to have met with Argentine officials in June. In a critical report, The Economist proposes that Arregui might actually have come under pressure from the Argentine government, known for its interventionism in economy, maybe as a show of strength by President N√©stor Kirchner faced with the upcoming 2007 elections. Botnia's project is much more advanced than ENCE's, and employs 4,500 workers. After a strike started on 12 September, demanding that no more workers be brought from abroad and equal pay for local and foreign workers already in the project, the management decided to pause the construction \\"due to a lack of guarantees and until the conditions required for the development of this project are re- established.\\" The construction works restarted 7 October with a unanimous decision by the construction workers. On 24 September, thousands of Gualeguaych√∫ residents marched with cars, motorcycles, and bicycles along Route 136, effectively blocking traffic for more than 3 hours, celebrating ENCE's withdrawal and demanding that Botnia follow suit. At the same time, following rumours that ENCE would move the location of the mills to Paysand√∫, also on the Uruguay River, some 4,000 residents of Col√≥n, opposite Paysand√∫, gathered before the international bridge to protest that possibility. The mayors of both cities met the following day to discuss the issue. October 2006 =Argentine newspaper publishes misleading photograph= On 15 October La Naci√≥n published a beach photo presenting the visual impact of the pulp mill on √ëandubaysal beach. However, the photo had been taken with a 300 mm telephoto lens: the mill hardly visible in the horizon in the 12 kilometer distance is presented to be located in the island close to the Argentine coast.Requiem para una Asamblea, by Mario F√©liz =World Bank study says Uruguay mills meet all environmental standards= On 12 October the World Bank Group's International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) released the final cumulative impact study for the two proposed pulp mill projects. Both institutions were confident that the findings demonstrated that the mills will comply with IFC and MIGA's environmental and social policies, while generating significant economic benefits for the Uruguayan economy. Also so called Hatfield Consultants, which had in March presented questioned the draft CIS, reviewed the final CIS, and confirmed the results of the final CIS. The more than two hundred pages study performed by EcoMetrix Incorporated concluded that the plans construction and operation posed no risk to air and water quality. In reaction to the study, the Gualeguaych√∫ Assembly decided to block the international road again during the following long weekend (Columbus Day Weekend). The leaflets distributed for travellers described dire consequences for the life in Gualeguaych√∫ (dioxin pollution, acid rain, increased incidence of cancer) when the mills start operations (the same accusations available in CEDHA homepages). Meanwhile, activists in Buenos Aires started a campaign calling Argentines to stay in Argentina for the summer vacations instead of going to Uruguay. The Argentine government and the provincial Entre R√≠os government released a joint statement showing disagreement with the blockade, and laying the blame on the Assembly \\"for any harm that [the blockade] may cause to Argentine interests\\", but did not take any specific measures to prevent the blockade. The Assembly of Col√≥n blocked International Road 135 as well, though only intermittently. During the weekend, Romina Picolotti, the Argentine Environment Secretary, sent a letter to IFC authorities claiming that the EcoMetrix study did not provide any new data, but employed those found in the environmental impact studies conducted for Botnia and ENCE, and that the section of the study devoted to the hydrological model was handled by an engineer who had previously been hired for Botnia's own study. Picolotti also claimed there were \\"substantial errors\\" in the study, such as exaggerating the flow of the Uruguay River and stating that it is 20 km wide, whereas no part of it is over 12 km wide. On 17 October, the IFC and MIGA announced that they will ask their Boards of Directors to approve IFC financing and MIGA guarantee support for Oy Mets√§-Botnia's Orion pulp mill project in Uruguay. According to the IFC press release, \\"the decision to proceed was based on an extensive due diligence process, which included the conclusive and positive findings of a cumulative impact study and a subsequent review of the study undertaken by independent experts (the Hatfield report)\\". =Gualeguaych√∫ Assembly's strategy= On 20 October the Gualeguaych√∫ Assembly started discussing the possibility of new road blockades and a blockade of the Uruguay River to prevent supplies from reaching Botnia's mill. Assembly member Mart√≠n Alazar told Uruguayan newspaper El Observador that \\"River blockade is likely to happen, we have studied several alternatives and places\\". Furthermore, the activists are working on challenging the technical reports issued by the International Financial Corporation earlier this week. Other members of the Assembly claimed that \\"road blockades are, today, the best argument\\" to stop the construction of the mills, and that they are being forced \\"to take violent action\\" faced with the lack of action from the governments. November 2006 =Wall blockade= On 3 November (Friday), the Gualeguaych√∫ Assembly decided to stage a new blockade for the duration of the weekend, this time erecting a concrete block wall. The 1.8-meter-high wall blocked International Route 136 almost completely, and displayed a sign in English and Finnish against the pulp mills. On the afternoon of 5 November, the Assembly dismantled the wall and lifted the blockade as planned. =King Juan Carlos agrees to intercede= During the XVI Ibero-American Summit in Montevideo, presidents Kirchner and V√°zquez avoided a meeting between them. However, Kirchner asked King Juan Carlos of Spain to facilitate the renewal of negotiations between the two countries. The proposition was accepted by the Uruguayan government. Trinidad Jim√©nez, Spanish Secretary of State for Ibero-America, explained that the monarch would not be a mediator, yet he would facilitate the easing of tensions within this conflict. The Uruguayan government, in turn, stated again it would not agree to meetings at the presidential level if a road blockade is in place, as it was at the time. Jos√© Pouler, a member of the Gualeguaych√∫ Assembly, expressed support for the facilitation, calling it \\"a good initiative\\", though he pointed out that, to them, the construction of the mills on the river \\"is not negotiable\\". = IFC and MIGA approve loan = On 21 November 2006 the boards of directors of the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency approved a $170 million investment by IFC and a guarantee of up to $350 million from MIGA for the proposed project. The press release from the IFC states that \\"the two organizations, after completing a thorough review of the facts, are convinced that the mill will generate significant economic benefits for Uruguay and cause no environmental harm.\\" The Argentine president, N√©stor Kirchner, reacted to the news by attacking what he considers the stubbornness of his Uruguayan counterpart and expressing that the approval was a victory for the international interests that want the region to be a global waste dump. He also restated that his government will not use force to stop blockades by Gualeguaychu's residents. December 2006 On 13 December, the Spanish company ENCE, owner of one of the planned two mills, announced that it will move the mill 250 km south of its original position, away from the Uruguay River, after negotiations with the Argentine and Uruguayan governments. The remaining mill, owned by the Finnish company Botnia, stay in place. January 2007 On 23 January 2007, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) rejected, by 14 votes against one, Uruguay's request for \\"provisional measures\\" against Argentina ‚Äîa form of injunctive relief‚Äîaimed at putting an immediate end to blockades of bridges and roads. The ICJ in its ruling stated: \\"(the ICJ) is not convinced that the blockades risk prejudicing irreparably the rights which Uruguay claims from the 1975 Statute and adds that it has not shown that, were there such a risk, it would be imminent. The Court consequently finds that the circumstances of the case are not such as to require the indication of the first provisional measure requested by Uruguay (to prevent or end the interruption of transit between the two States and inter alia the blockading of the bridges and roads linking them)\\". February 2007 Spain began mediation in the dispute through envoy Ya√±ez Barnuevo but as of March there was no visible progress. November 2007 On 9 November 2007, the Uruguayan government gave final approval to produce eucalyptus pulp at Botnia's mill in Fray Bentos,Bloomberg. 9 November 2007 \\"Metsae-Botnia Gets Permit From Uruguay to Start Pulp Production\\" and on 15 November 2007 the mill produced its first load.Forbes, 15 November 2007 \\"Uruguay Pulp Plant Produces First Load\\" The Uruguayan director for the environment declared that all the environmental tests performed by authorities had produced normal results.El Observador, 15 November 2007 \\"Botnia pas√≥ la primera prueba medioambiental\\" Also, the IFC released reports from two independent external consultants that indicated that Botnia's Orion pulp mill in Uruguay was ready to operate in accordance with IFC's environmental and social requirements and international best available technology standards. IFC also provided an updated Environmental and Social Action Plan, reflecting the status of Botnia's compliance with the issues to be addressed as a condition of IFC financing of the project. The reports and updated ESAP confirm that the Orion pulp mill will generate major economic benefits for Uruguay and will not cause harm to the environment.International Finance Corporation, 13 November 2007 \\"Orion Pulp Mill ‚Äì Uruguay\\" March/April 2010 The internal compliance/ombudsman (i.e. the Compliance Advisor/Ombudsman) of the World Bank in Washington, D.C. carried out an appraisal of the Orion Pulp Mill to determine whether internal guidance had been followed and whether the plant was being monitored according to IFC requirements. The conclusions, published on 15 March 2010,CAO March 2010 \\"Uruguay / Orion-02/Gualeguaych√∫-Argentina\\" of the independent consultant were that: \\"‚Ä¢ Emissions to air and water have been thoroughly addressed by IFC during the assessment phase, and the monitoring and reporting demonstrate that IFC assured itself of the Project's performance against applicable requirements. ‚Ä¢ There is no indication that IFC did not assure itself that the independent verification of the monitoring fulfills the applicable IFC requirement. ‚Ä¢ There are no indications that IFC failed to assure itself of the applicability of the World Bank's safeguarding policy OP 7.50 for Waterways (2001). ‚Ä¢ This case does not fulfill the criteria for further investigation in the form of an audit. CAO has closed appraisal of this case with no further action.\\" Argentina filed suit in 2006 at the International Court of Justice in The Hague, a court that adjudicates disputes between States, claiming that pollution from the mills will cause serious environmental damage and that they were being erected in breach of the 1975 border treaty known as the Statute of the River Uruguay In April 2010, the ICJ ruled the pulp mill in Uruguay can keep operating. It is also stated that Uruguay failed to negotiate with Argentina over the plant, but said it would not be appropriate to make Uruguay pay damages or dismantle the operation. Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Taiana calls Gualeguaych√∫ activists to reconsider their hard position and lift pickets. Presidents Cristina Fern√°ndez and Jos√© Mujica will meet at Quinta de Olivos in Buenos Aires to analyze the result In December 2009 Finnish UPM-Kymmene Oyj became the sole owner of the pulp mill. End of the dispute The President signing the agreement in July 2010 New Uruguay president Jos√© Mujica made a great effort to end the dispute meeting with president Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner four times in a few weeks in 2010. Former president Tabar√© V√°zquez recognized in a visit to Buenos Aires that he was not able to do so. On 19 June, the environmentalists lift the bridge blockade and on 28 July both presidents agreed to create a binational commission CARU () in order to monitor the river pollution officially ending the dispute as a basic agreement that satisfies both societies and the two governments Tabar√© V√°zquez mentioned in October 2011 that he had considered the possibility of an armed conflict with Argentina over the topic, and sought support of the United States (during the presidency of George Bush) in such a case. He had interviews with Condoleezza Rice, and ordered the military commanders to stay ready.El video en el que Tabar√© V√°zquez habl√≥ sobre una guerra por las pasteras  2013  Uruguay allowed UPM to increase production at Fray Bentos mill from 1.1 million tonnes a year to 1.3 million tonnes in 2013. Argentina threatened to take Uruguay to the International Court of Justice, despite having lost its earlier case. Uruguay Senator Lucia Topolansky denied that there were plans to construct a new plant at the site.

The story follows the adventures of Yuri Shibuya, an average 15-year-old Japanese high school student, who is suddenly transported to another world where he is told that he is now the king of demons. Yuri becomes the king of a nation where all of the citizens are demons, but they appear indistinguishable from humans. Their only distinguishing traits are their long lives and the ability to use magic. The people of the Demon Tribe are able to make a pact with an element after which they can then use magic of that element. Covenant Castle is in the capital of the Demon Kingdom. It is the residence of the demon king. The culture of The Great Demon Kingdom is very different from the Japanese culture Yuri is accustomed to, and the differences make for amusing mishaps with long ranging consequences, such as an accidental proposal of marriage. The series was adapted into an anime in 2004 by NHK and a manga in 2005 serialized in Asuka magazine. The manga was updated for release by VIZ Media and launched in North America on September 30, 2014. Plot While on his way home from school, Yuri Shibuya sees his classmate, Ken Murata, being harassed by bullies. When Yuri intervenes, Murata runs away, and Yuri becomes their new target. They force him into the girls' bathroom and shove his face into a toilet, where a portal suddenly appears. Yuri is sucked in and is rendered unconscious. He wakes up to discover himself in a strange world where no one speaks Japanese. Yuri comes to find out that he is of lineage and is the of this world, . He is taken to the capital by G√ºnter and Conrad. When he arrives at the castle, he meets Wolfram and Gwendal, who find it hard to believe that Yuri is their new king. At dinner the next day, Yuri slaps Wolfram after the latter insults Yuri's mother for being human. Unknown to Yuri, among the nobles in the Demon Kingdom, a slap on the cheek is considered a marriage proposal. Wolfram is insulted and immediately challenges him to a duel by throwing his knife on the floor. Yuri, again being unfamiliar with the kingdom's customs, picks up the knife, unknowingly accepting the duel. After Yuri wins by using magical powers he was unaware he possessed, he is accepted as the true demon king. The story follows Yuri on his adventures trying to learn the ways of the Great Demon Kingdom while battling discrimination and fear. He does not know much of the world but applies his moral judgment onto every situation in order to find a peaceful outcome. His ultimate goal is to bring peace to both demons and humans, hoping to one day live together while avoiding war at all costs. Even though he has a choice to leave his responsibilities to his advisers, he continues to involve himself in most affairs in the belief that to be a great king he must be willing to know his subjects and risk everything to protect the kingdom. Yuri also battles with the notion of belonging to one world. While he misses his home in Japan on Earth, he develops a family and home in the Great Demon Kingdom, which leads to some very hard choices. Although romance is not a main focus of the story, the anime has been noted for its sh≈çnen-ai undertones. For example, Yuri and Wolfram are engaged, and a number of jokes in the series revolve around misunderstandings that arise from this arrangement. Media =Light novels= Written by Tomo Takabayashi with illustrations by Temari Matsumoto. The novels are released under Kadokawa's Beans Collection. The first novel was released in November 2000. There are currently 22 books in the series. 17 are main story novels and the other 5 are extras and side stories which provide background and other information to the story. =Manga= Drawn by Temari Matsumoto, the Kyo Kara Maoh! manga series (Titled Ky≈ç Kara MA no Tsuku Jiy≈´gy≈ç! (‰ªäÊó•„Åã„Çâ„Éû„ÅÆ„Å§„ÅèËá™Áî±Ê•≠!) in Japanese) debuted in June 2005 issue of the monthly Asuka magazine on April 23, 2005, and ended on July 23, 2016. The first volume of the manga was released on December 26, 2005 and 21 volumes total have been released. An English-language version of the manga was licensed by Tokyopop but when Tokyopop shut down their North American branch in 2011 all of their licenses were cancelled. They released seven volumes of the manga before they shut down. After 3 years, VIZ Media licensed a digital release in North America, releasing the seven volumes in 2014. =Anime= The anime adaptation of Kyo Kara Maoh was directed by Junji Nishimura, animated by Studio Deen, and produced by NHK. It aired across Japan on NHK. The series consists of 117 episodes and 5 OVA episodes. While much the first season follows the original story from the novels, the plot in the following seasons varies drastically. The anime was originally licensed for release in North America by Geneon under the title Kyo Kara Maoh! God(?) Save Our King!, but when Geneon ceased production of their titles in late 2007, it left three volumes of the second season unreleased on DVD in North America. On July 3, 2008, Geneon Entertainment and Funimation Entertainment announced an agreement to distribute select titles in North America. While Geneon Entertainment will still retain the license, Funimation Entertainment will assume exclusive rights to the manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of select titles. Kyo Kara Maoh! was one of the titles involved in the deal. In August 2011, Funimation announced that the license expired and that they had no plans to renew the license. On February 22, 2019, Discotek Media announced its license of the first season for an April 30, 2019 Blu-ray release. =Musical= In April 2013 the series was adapted into a musical titled Kyo Kara Maoh! Birth of the Maou. It showed for 11 days during golden week at the Hakuhinkan theater. It was produced by S≈çg≈ç Vision.

To distract attention from a planned cavalry-infantry raid up the Virginia Peninsula on Richmond, the Union Army of the Potomac forced several crossings of the Rapidan River on February 6, 1864. Units of the II Corps under Maj. Gen. John C. Caldwell crossed at Morton's Ford, the I Corps at Raccoon Ford, and Union cavalry at Robertson's Ford. Confederate Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia resisted the crossings, with sporadic fighting and the most severe fighting at Morton's Ford. By February 7, 1864, the attacks had stalled, and the Union army withdrew during the night, with the results of the battle inconclusive. Background Alexander Hays Union Major General Benjamin Butler, commanding the Army of the James in Fort Monroe, learned that General Robert E. Lee had detached a small portion of the Army of Northern Virginia to North Carolina. Convinced that Lee had sent a larger detachment than he actually did, Butler was convinced that an attack by the Army of the Potomac would force Lee to use troops from the defenses of Richmond to ward off the attack. Major General John Sedgwick, temporarily commanding the Army of the Potomac, protested that Lee had detached fewer men than Butler thought and that the local roads and weather were too poor for a winter attack. However, both Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton and general-in-chief Henry W. Halleck overruled his objections and ordered him to make the attack on February 6.Mahood, pp. 25-26; Trinque, p. 40. The demonstration would take place near Morton's Ford, near a bend in the Rapidan River which formed a mile wide patch of land. Major General Edward Johnson's division of Richard Ewell's Second Corps had dug a series of entrenchments across the base of the bend. The Union II Corps, temporarily under the command of John C. Caldwell due to the illness of Gouverneur K. Warren, would move to Morton's Ford, with the I Corps marching to nearby Racoon Ford to the west and the cavalry crossing at Robertson's Ford.Mahood, p. 26; Trinque, pp. 40, 42. The battle Map of Morton's Ford Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. The II Corps reached the ford about 9:30 a.m.; finding a line of pickets along the bank, 3rd Division commander Brigadier General Alexander Hays ordered three hundred men of Brigadier General Joshua Owen's 1st Brigade across the river to drive off the pickets. This was done successfully, resulting in the capture of thirty members of the Stonewall Brigade without any Union losses. The rest of Owen's brigade crossed the river but then encountered heavy artillery fire. Johnson brought up one brigade and parts of two others, along with additional artillery. At 12:30 p.m., Hays received permission from Caldwell to bring the rest of his division across the ford, which took two hours, while Caldwell positioned Union artillery on the heights north of the river; during this time Johnson continued to receive reinforcements.Trinque, pp. 40-43. Warren heard of the heavy fighting at Morton's Ford about midday and immediately started riding to the front. By 3 p.m. he arrived at the ford and, deciding that the Union position was too precarious to be held, ordered Hays' division to withdraw after nightfall. However, Johnson launched an infantry attack just as dusk was starting. Hays' right flank began to falter and a counterattack by three regiments succeeded in holding back the Confederates. At this time, Alexander S. Webb's division arrived to support Hays, until it was decided to withdraw both divisions starting about 8 p.m.Trinque, pp. 43-45. Aftermath Both divisions were back across the Rapidan by 2 a.m., with the Confederates reoccupying their entrenchments immediately afterwards. Union casualties total 262, while the Confederates lost sixty. Due to a Union deserter who revealed the Union plans to the Confederates, Butler never made an attack on Richmond, while Lee never requested reinforcements from the city. The I Corps also failed to cross the river, never getting closer than a mile and a half from Raccoon Ford.Mahood, p. 31; Trinque, pp. 42, 45, 88; Kennedy, p. 260. After the battle, Hays was accused of being drunk during the battle and of acting irrationally. However, many officers, including several in his division, attested that Hays was sober throughout the engagement. All of the accusations about Hays being drunk at Morton's Ford came from the 14th Connecticut, which suffered nearly half of the Union casualties in the battle and may have felt resentment against Hays because of it.Mahood, pp. 29-31.

It was a member of the Holy Roman Empire from 1495 to 1806. The dukedom's long survival for nearly four centuries was mainly due to its size, being larger than its immediate neighbors. During the Protestant Reformation, W√ºrttemberg faced great pressure from the Holy Roman Empire to remain a member. W√ºrttemberg resisted repeated French invasions in the 17th and 18th centuries. W√ºrttemberg was directly in the path of French and Austrian armies who were engaged in the long rivalry between the House of Bourbon and the House of Habsburg. In 1803, Napoleon raised the duchy to be the Electorate of W√ºrttemberg of the Holy Roman Empire. On 1 January 1806, the last Elector assumed the title of King of W√ºrttemberg. Later that year, on 6 August 1806, the last Emperor, Francis II, abolished (de facto) the Holy Roman Empire. Geography Much of the territory of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg lies in the valley of the Neckar river, from T√ºbingen to Heilbronn, with its capital and largest city, Stuttgart, in the center. The northern part of W√ºrttemberg is wide and open, with large rivers making for decent arable land. The southern part of W√ºrttemberg is mountainous and wooded, with the Black Forest to the west and the Swabian Alb to the east. The very southeastern part of the Duchy, on the other side of the Swabian Alb, is Ulm and the Danube river basin. The Duchy of W√ºrttemberg was over of pastures, forests, and rivers. Politically, it was a patchwork of 350 smaller territories governed by many different secular and ecclesiastical landlords. As early as the 14th century, it had dissolved into many districts (called √Ñmter or Vogteien in German), which originally were called \\"Steuergemeinde,\\" a \\"small, taxable community.\\" By 1520, the number of these districts had risen to 45, from 38 in 1442, and would number 58 by the end of the 16th century. These varied vastly in size, with Urach containing 76 outlying villages to Ebingen, which only contained its eponymous town. W√ºrttemberg was also one of the most populous regions of the Holy Roman Empire, supporting 300,000-400,000 inhabitants (and a birthrate that grew 6‚Äì7% each year) in the 16th century, 70% of which lived in the countryside. The largest town in the Duchy was Stuttgart (9,000), followed by Heilbronn, Schw√§bisch Hall, Esslingen, and Reutlingen (5,000+), then T√ºbingen, Schorndorf, and Kirchheim-Teck (2,000-5,000), and over 670 villages that contained the rest of the population. History =Foundation= The Duchy of W√ºrttemberg was formed when, at the Diet of Worms, 21 July 1495, Maximilian I, King of the Romans and Holy Roman Emperor, declared the Count of W√ºrttemberg (), Eberhard V \\"the Bearded,\\" Duke of W√ºrttemberg (). This would be the last elevation to Dukedom of the Medieval era. The House of W√ºrttemberg had reigned over the territory since the 11th century, and Duke Eberhard I himself ascended to the throne in 1450 at the age of 14, over a territory split in two states: the W√ºrttemberg ruled by the W√ºrttemberg-Stuttgart line, and the W√ºrttemberg of the W√ºrttemberg-Urach line. In 1482, he united the two parts of the future Duchy, fusing the governments of both counties into what would be the basis of the Duchy's central government. After Eberhard's death in 1495, he was succeeded by his cousin, Eberhard II, and he would make little change to the government's structure. Despite having earlier been the Count from 1480 to 1482, he proved to be administratively incompetent, and his attempt to begin a war against Bavaria prompted the Estates to request Maximilian I to call a diet in March 1498 to remove Eberhard II. The Emperor then made the unprecedented decision to side with the Estates and thus deprived Duke Eberhard II of his principality in May 1498. While the Duke's advisers were arrested or fled, Eberhard II himself was banished to Lindenfels Castle and granted an annuity of 6000 florins until his death in 1504. The one accomplishment of Eberhard II's reign was the establishment of the Hofkapelle for the performance of religious music, and this system of music patronage would remain uninterrupted until the Thirty Years' War. =Duke Ulrich's first reign= Ulrich, of the Urach line of the W√ºrttemberg family, succeeded Eberhard II in 1498, in his minority. His regency was controlled by four nobles: Counts Wolfgang von F√ºrstenberg and Andreas von Waldburg, Hans von Reischach (the senior bailiff of M√∂mpelgard), and Diepolt Sp√§t (the senior bailiff of T√ºbingen). Two other men, the abbots of Zwiefalten and Bebenhausen, also held advisory positions in the regency. While the regency would hear the wishes of the people through the Estates, they became opposed to the wishes of the local burghers during the very unpopular Swabian War, to which the Estates voted more soldiers and money. Maximilian I declared Ulrich I of age at 16, in the process violating the 1492 that stipulated that he could only fully succeed at 20. Thus began one of the longest and most tumultuous periods in the history of the region. The young Duke at first made little change to the government, allowing his councilors to decide on policy while he made his greatest marks in the Duchy through the expansion of the realm, usually through war. With the aid of Duke Albert IV of Bavaria and Maximilian I, Ulrich invaded the Rhine Palatinate with an army of 20,000 soldiers, obtaining Maulbronn Abbey, the County of L√∂wenstein and the districts of Weinsberg, Neuenstadt am Kocher, and M√∂ckm√ºhl from the Palatinate as well as Heidenheim an der Brenz and the abbeys of K√∂nigsbronn, Anhausen, and Herbrechtingen. Ulrich's ability to rule, on the other hand, was less reliable. The first crisis he faced was financial: since the beginning of his reign to 1514, he had racked up a debt of more than 600,000 florins in addition to the debt of 300,000 florins he inherited, amounting to almost one million florins. Ulrich attempted to assuage this with a 6% wealth tax (1 pfennig on 1 gulden), which was met with fierce resistance by his subjects, particularly the Ehrbarkeit, who had the most to lose. Ulrich refused to call a diet to discuss this tax, but he did not press it and repealed it. Following this failure, Ulrich next tried an indirect tax (3 schilling heller on the Centner) on consumables such as meats, wine and grain. Again Ulrich refused to call a diet to discuss the tax, but successfully levied it through local and district officials. This particular tax was intensely unpopular, even more so than the first, as it was implemented by the officials who had dodged the first tax, drove the prices of their food up and, to the chagrin of the lower classes, Ulrich and his government sought to have Roman law officially accepted into W√ºrttemberg's legal system. The tax, combined with the statute passed by the Estates in 1514 that denied scales and weights, further hurting merchants and farmers, the lack of say commoners had in their own government, and the restriction of the use of the forests, rivers and meadows around them caused much unrest. To pour salt into the wound, the commoners came to dread the increase in lawyers and officials, who brought new legal methods. A list of grievances from the peasantry makes clear their dissatisfaction,Marcus 2000, p. 43: \\"...the rich must share with us; we want to spear the great ones (Grossk√∂pfe), so that their insides fall to the ground; the duke is of no use and the marshal [Thumb von Neuburg] is getting richer; now we have the sword in the hand, now the sun stands in our constellation; different advisers, district officials, bailiffs must appear, and no longer the fat ones.\\" and the final result of this dissatisfaction and taxation was the Poor Conrad revolt, which began in Kernen im Remstal in the Schorndorf district, from Stuttgart, a wine-growing region particularly affected by economic downturn caused by poor harvests in recent years and high taxation. Despite Ulrich's repealing of the excise on meat, discontent continued to grow, forcing Ulrich to finally call a diet. He held it in T√ºbingen on 26 June 1514 in a move that showed his paranoia of public opinion of him in the capital, and would be the first of three diets in Ulrich's reign, though representatives from 14 towns in the Duchy had met previously in Marbach am Neckar in order to effectively pacify the attending commoners. The result of that pre-meeting was the list of 41 articles that became the Treaty of T√ºbingen, the most significant piece of legislation of Ulrich's reign, at the Diet on 8 July 1514. The Estates agreed to pay Ulrich 920,000 florins over the next decade to annul his debts in exchange for requiring the consent of the Estates prior to any declaration of war, the prosecution of criminals to be instigated only with a regular legal procedure, and the right all citizens of the Duchy at will, called the Freisitz, provided they met certain criteria. While the relationship between the Duke and the Estates seemed to be cemented, the Dukes did not always abide by the Treaty, and the knights and prelates, who appeared at no point or at one point in the creation of the Treaty respectively, had little no involvement in it. Ironically, the Treaty, which would not be fully implemented for the rest of the 16th century, appeared to be more of a victory for Duke Ulrich, as he sought just to appease the Estates and to obtain the funds required to continue his rule, both of which he had accomplished, obliging him to ignore the treaty. Three events would come to be responsible for the demise of Duke Ulrich's first rule. The first of these would be the murder of his equerry, Hans Ritter von Hutten, in the forests of B√∂blingen in May 1515. Ulrich had taken a romantic interest in von Hutten's wife and, according to a later declaration the Imperial Diet of Augsburg on 19 August 1518, had become hostile towards him after Hans' marriage to Ursula von Hutten.Marcus 2000, p. 44: Hans von Hutten had been Ulrich's \\"most trusted, highest and dearest servant ... until von Hutten took a wife, then ... [the duke] became unfriendly and hateful towards him.\\" Ursula was the daughter of Thumb von Neuburg, the marshal and one of the most influential men in the ducal court, and Hans von Hutten was the cousin of Ulrich von Hutten, a famous humanist and knight who was also a firebrand publicist, and son of Ludwig von Hutten, a Franconian knight who had also served in the ducal court and was of the von Huttens, one of the most powerful lower noble families in the entire Duchy. The political fallout of this murder resulted in the immediate resignation of 18 noblemen from Ulrich's court, demands from the von Huttens for financial compensation, and fiery, printed attacks by Ulrich von Hutten. The second event was the flight of Ulrich's wife, Sabine of Bavaria, back to her family in November 1515 along with Dietrich Sp√§t, one of Ulrich's advisers. Overnight she had unmade a match Emperor Maximilian I had arranged with her father, Duke Alphrecht. She had complained bitterly about the mistreatment she had experienced by Ulrich, of von Hutten's murder, and of Ulrich's refusal to pay off her debts. Her immediate family demanded immediate compensation and for Ulrich to be expelled, and to this end appealed to the Estates but were rebuked, despite Ulrich's now widespread unpopularity out of loyalty to him and a lack of influence in W√ºrttemberg on Sabine's part. The Bavarians resorted to attacking the Duchy, causing Maximilian I to intervene and call a diet in Stuttgart on 18 September 1515 to limit Ulrich's power and to create a balanced system of government. This resulted in the Treaty of Blaubeuren, which mandated that a seven-member regency would rule the Duchy for a period of six years consisting of the Landhofmeister, the Chancellor, a prelate, two nobles, and two burghers, with an eighth regent to be named by the Emperor. Ulrich himself was to be dependent on this regency for counsel, and he no longer had control of the Duchy, a proposition he was not in agreement with. Ulrich charged many leading members of the Ehrbarkeit, and of them killed brothers Conrad and Sebastion Breuning, Conrad Vaut, the bailiff of Cannstatt, and Hans Stickel, the Burgomaster of Stuttgart. After the executions of the Breuning brothers, Maximilian attempted to call another diet to enforce the Treaty of Blaubeuren, but it was here that he realized the fatal flaw of the treaty: it did not involve the Estates and, thanks in part to Maximilian's advanced age, they neither the will nor power to act against Ulrich. The final event that sealed the fate of Ulrich's first reign of the Duchy came eight days after Maximilian I's death on 12 January 1519, when Duke Ulrich stormed the Imperial City of Reutlingen on the pretense of avenging the recent murder of the commander of the town's fort and his wife. He made it a property of W√ºrttemberg property, with its allegiance owed to Ulrich rather than the Emperor. This entire event, the metaphorical last straw of Ulrich's reign, was in complete violation of the Treaty of T√ºbingen and angered the other Free Cities, most of whom were in the Swabian League, from which W√ºrttemberg had been expelled in February 1512 against the wishes of Maximilian I, who prepared for war while Ulrich coerced 80,000 florins from the Estates and received 10,000 crowns from Francis I of France in February 1519 to fund his war and repay a past debt. The man to lead the Swabian League army was the capable Duke Wilhelm IV of Bavaria, and his campaign would last little over two weeks. It opened with Duke Wilhelm IV attacking Hellenstein Castle on 28 March 1519, followed then by attacks on Esslingen, Uhlbach, Obert√ºrkheim, Hedelfingen, the nunnery of Weiler Filstand, Hunddskehle Castle, Teck Castle, and finally stormed Stuttgart in April and forced Ulrich to flee. His first reign had ended, and he would not return for 15 years. =Habsburg occupation= The first order of business for the Swabian League occupation was to set W√ºrttemberg's government in order, and one of the most crucial tasks to achieve this was to settle the enormous 1.1 million gulden debt, and few wanted to help finance this mountainous deficit. The knights, who were at this time most able to assist, did not want to as they felt that they did not constitute an estate of the Duchy and were thus without obligation to the Duchy. Since the knights refused to pay and the Ehrbarkeit and lay citizenry had not the funds to pay, the League sold the Duchy to the new Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, on 6 February 1520 for a sum of 220,000 florins with the blessing of the Estates and on the conditions that they pay Ulrich's debts and that they defend the Duchy from any future attacks made by Ulrich. Charles V may have had some motives in the purchasing of the Duchy based on plans of Maximilian I's in 1518 of \\"Austrian centralization\\" in Swabia with \\"an integrated judicial system.\\" Charles V did not, however, ever rule the Duchy himself, electing instead to proclaim the \\"freedom of the Estates of W√ºrttemberg\\" on 15 October 1520 and that it would pay him an annual levy of 22,000 florins, setting the tone of the Habsburgs' 14-year rule of W√ºrttemberg, one in which the nobility were to be empowered.Marcus 2000, p. 47: \\"as the nobility well-suits the duchy in every way ... it will be respected; the duchy will be dependent on it; and will obey it as far as possible.\\" This government in Charles V's absence was headed by a new position, the Statthalter, a nobleman who represented the Emperor in all matters, and the reinstated Gregor Lamparter, one of the Ehrbarkeit and Chancellor at the time Ulrich had arrested that had escaped death. Charles V turned the Duchy over to Archduke Ferdinand I on 31 March 1522, who first called a diet to publicly state his support of the Treaty of T√ºbingen, followed by the appointment of a new Statthalter, Maximilian van Zeverbergen from the Netherlands, and Chancellor, Heinrich Winckelhofer, who was aided in the issuing of the Statthalters orders by the regents and other commissioners. Treasury officials were given much more control over the treasury than in Ulrich's reign so as to reestablish order, and the Estates would help organize it like its counterpart in Austria, which was separate from the Chancery and was called the Kammer and was operated by three treasurers. This control over the treasury and state expenditure would be the most important reform of the Habsburg occupation. Government The government of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg was one composed of several hundred people. One group, called the \\"Notables,\\" or Ehrbarkeit, made up of powerful local families, was the dominant force in the local administration of the Duchy. The central government consisted primarily of a bureaucracy of these Ehrbarkeit from the regional towns that came to work and live in Stuttgart. Typically, these officials began in local or district government, and then retired to their home towns in their later years or when court was not in session, creating the \\"town and district\\" character of W√ºrttemberg's politics. An oddity of the Duchy in comparison to other German states was that burghers held positions in the Duchy's central government alongside nobility, most of them holding an extensive university education, and were employed in an ever-growing number for the administrative needs of the Duchy. Despite the lower pay and prestige they enjoyed by comparison to nobility, burghers would remain their own distinct class. The best example of the power wielded by the burghers in the Duchy's government, however, was to be found in the Estates, who sought always to hold the Duke to the terms of the Treaty of T√ºbingen, a piece of legislation that outlined the rights of the burghers and the Duke's duties to them. The foundations of the government of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg were laid even before the elevation of the County of W√ºrttemberg in 1495. The House of W√ºrttemberg had governed the territory for centuries, but had split in half along the two branches of the family in 1442 by the Treaty of N√ºrtingen. When Count Eberhard V the Bearded united the two halves of the Duchy in 1482, he merged the governments of the two into the basis of the central government. An important department of this government was the chancery (Kanzlei), which had existed in W√ºrttemberg since 1482 and found its headquarters in the capital, Stuttgart. The supervision of the count's court income and grain and wine had become too great for the 15th century Hofmeister and cellarer, prompting the creation of the receipt department (Zentralkasse), staffed by the territorial clerk (Landschreiber) and ducal treasurer (Kammermeister). To complement this was the central financial office (Landschreiberei), in essence the government treasury that received the taxes collected across the Duchy. =District government= The Ehrbarkeit held a variety of positions in local government as well as district government, which relied on a network of the Duchy's market towns, establishing a link between the town and the countryside. The most powerful official in a district was the bailiff (Vogt), who governed and supervised the functions of urban government in the name of the Duke from the district seat (Amtstadt). This position first appeared around 1425, but it took around seventy years for the functions of the bailiff to be fully established. By the end of the 15th century, this office had split into senior bailiff (Obervogt), typically a nobleman, and junior bailiff (Untervogt), who would preside in the absence of the senior bailiff and was usually himself a burgher. The senior bailiff, more free than his counterpart, was not restricted to serving within his own district and would sometimes advise other rulers and even the Duke. The senior bailiff was also charged with the defense of his district and so usually would reside in a castle in or near the district seat. Old noble families traditionally served in their districts, giving them experience that some would use to secure positions in the central government of the Duchy. By the end of the 17th century, the title of senior bailiff had become almost entirely honorary and only about 25 were employed by the Duchy. The junior bailiff was a much more executive officer, being charged with law and order through the district courts, and he also supervised the district's finances and the levying of new taxes. If he was unable to rectify any given situation, he would refer it to the chancery in Stuttgart, and the Chancellor (Kanzler) would decide the matter. This position, the link between local, district, and central government, was very common among officials who would later join the central government. Two more offices completed district government: the Cellarer (Keller or Pfleger) and the Forester (Forstmeister or Waldvogt), of whom there were never more than 12. The cellarer oversaw the collection and stockpiling of the district's grain and wine, a job previously managed by the bailiff until the creation of the cellarer (this duty would sometime be performed by another chief administrative officer called the Schultheiss). The forester, a position created around 1410, was in charge of the forests in his district, enforcing the laws governing the forest that covered such things as logging and hunting. Often, he came into conflict with the citizenry, who resented the increasing taxes and restrictions placed on the forest's use. =Local government= The primary power in local government were the town council and court (Rat und Gericht). The council handled the town's daily affairs while the court exercised civil jurisdiction in the town and jurisdiction of non-capital criminal affairs for the entire district. Though the bailiff was originally charged with appointing members of either organization in the 15th century, the membership of the council and court were, by the end of the 16th century, made up completely by the town's notables, people like rich artisans, merchants, and local guild members. One of the leading officials in the local government was a kind of village mayor called the Schultheiss. The origins of this position date back to the 13th century, the first recorded instances being in Rottweil in 1222 and in T√ºbingen in 1247. In that time, the town's lord (Stadtherr) chose the Schultheiss from a pool of 30 to 50 men and he governed the town according to the lord's interests. When the interests of the Scultheiss came to share those of the town's elite rather than the lord's, he created the position of bailiff in order to maintain his interests in the community. These two officials would work together for a time, but during the 15th century, the authority of the Schultheiss eroded. Despite this, he could still preside over the district court in the absence of the bailiff. Subordinate to the Schultheiss was the town's Burgomaster (Burgermeister), the only official to be elected by the citizenry and another office with its origins in the 13th century (the first documented one in Rottweil in 1283). However, popular election was still a rarity and he was typically appointed by the town council and normally from the town's notables. The Burgomaster often came into conflict with the Schultheiss as the former upheld the interests of the town council and the latter of the lord. His chief duties were the accounting of taxes, fines and other town incomes and to present an annual accounting (Gemeinderechnung) before the junior bailiff, whom he assisted in daily local administration. The number of Burgomasters throughout the Duchy was wildly inconsistent, as each town's constitution mandated how many Burgomasters the town could have and how long they served (most terms ranged from one year to a decade). In some instances, no Burgomasters were present in town and thus they only had a Schultheiss. The final office in local government was the town clerk (Stadtschreiber), who wrote up important documents for the council and would sometimes supervise the taxation of the populace. The town clerk was the link between the local and central governments, as he had to, for example, write all requests to be sent to the Duke by the citizenry (these would also have to be approved by the junior bailiff), making him one of the most important people in local government. He would also be expected to have a specific knowledge of the territory of the Duchy and the laws that governed it, and this would be tested by the chancery in Stuttgart whenever the clerk visited the capital. =Central government= As before, the Duchy's notables had a powerful presence in the central government but burghers, in particular, came to fill many important offices by either university education, clerical expertise, or administrative experience in district and local government. Burgher or noble, the many councilors in the central government had tremendous influence, even if that influence and thus the balance of power in the Duchy's administration, was subject to the whim of the ruling Duke. However, they were not entirely dependent on the Duke, as much of the actual governing was out of his hands, and the geographical location and political instability of the Duchy contributed greatly to its unique political development. One of the leading burgher councilors in the central government was the Chancellor (Kanzler), a position again traceable to the 13th century, when monks worked on documents for the court. The Duchy's first Chancellor was a prelate who was given the position by Count Eberhard V in 1481. However, after the County's elevation to a Duchy, this position would only be held by burghers, like most of the jobs in the chancery, because of the legal knowledge required. The growing influence of the chancery meant the growing influence of the Chancellor, normally the best educated of the Duke's councilors, typically holding a doctorate in canon and civil law as well as extensive administrative power. As one of the burgher elite, he was the link between the central government and local communities for settling disputes. If a matter could not be solved by the town council, it would be referred to the Chancellor by the bailiff, and he would decide the matter. The Chancellor also represented the Duke for diplomatic missions and occasionally at territorial diets of the Estates. By the mid-16th century, the advisory body to the Duke, the Oberrat, created the position of Vice Chancellor (Vizekanzler) in 1556 to aid the Chancellor, by now struggling with his workload, and to substitute for the Chancellor in his absence, and to serve as the secretary for sessions of the privy council (Geheimer Rat). More than any other official in the central government, the chamber secretary, Kammersekret√§r, charged with the organizing the Duke's schedule, writing Ducal correspondence, and processing documents, worked solely for the Duke. This job was also always held by a burgher, as he had to have clerical expertise, but almost never had a university education. At first, the Vice Chancellor held no political power, but then Duke Christoph enlarged the role of the Kammersekret√§r by allowing him to advise on policies concerning the chancery, church council, and even to oversee the treasury, a right no other official but the chamber master (Kammermeister) possessed. In the reign of Duke Ludwig, he would become one of the most influential officers in the central government, assuming the role of personal adviser and close friend to the Duke, rivaling only the territorial governor, Landhofmeister in influence on policy. Following the Reformation, new positions that worked during the Visitation were created. With the help of the Ducal court and reformers Johannes Brenz, Ambrosius Blarer, and Erhard Schnepf, a powerful new, centralized ecclesiastical cabinet formed to assure the Duke's will in religious matters were felt throughout the duchy via a strict system of visitation to all of the duchy's districts. The creation of the church council, Kirchenrat, in 1553 resulted in a position only held by burghers: the church council director, or Kirchenratdirektor, who worked with the church council on Ducal policy in religious matters, helped with the appointing of local preachers and administrating of church lands, and supervised the monasteries. Supervision of the monasteries and nunneries was important to the Duchy, as the Reformation made their exorbitant spending no longer acceptable, though they were still allowed to exist in Lutheran W√ºrttemberg. The government placed levies on the \\"fourteen great monastic trusts,\\" and the Duke or the Estates could spend this money on the Duchy's defense or on other projects. While he supervised this revenue, his clerks recorded it account books called Kirchenkastenrechungen. Of the positions only held by nobility, most were created in the 15th century and required little or no education, paid much more than burgher, and often involved constant contact to the Duke or other nobles. Originally, the W√ºrttemberg court had a Hofmeister, but this office was broken into the offices of territorial governor, Landhofmeister, and the court steward, Haushofmeister. The most powerful of the nobles in court traditionally was the territorial governor, Landhofmeister, who served as the Duke's foremost adviser and controlled the chancery. With the creation of the chancery in 1482, the same year as the reunification of the Duchy (then County) and establishment of Stuttgart as capital, the Landhofmeister and the Chancellor worked closely together, and this association remained important until the Kammersekret√§r supplanted the chancellor in importance. The Haushofmeister, who once accompanied the Duke on hunting trips and managed the court income and servants, was a position that would become merely honorary, and he would soon find himself relegated to tutoring of noble children and sourcing the food consumed by the court. This position was unique in that husband and wife could both serve as Haushofmeister and Haushofmesiterin, who would assist her husband and taught the female children of the nobility. A leading noble figure at the court was the Marshal, who was tasked with its defense as well as supervising the court servants (Hofgesinde). Although military experience was no longer considered a prerequisite by the reign of Duke Ludwig, it remained an important advisory position. The Kammermeister oversaw the Ducal treasury and was in this way distinct from the Landschreiber, who oversaw the general treasury. The Kammermeister was already a close adviser to the Duke, but he became even more powerful during the Habsburg occupation of the Duchy, as three were appointed to set the Duchy's finances in order. However, this title too became increasingly honorary; by the 1570s, there were long periods wherein there were no Kammermeister as the Kammersekret√§r had largely taken over his responsibilities. The final noble- held office in the central government was that of the Statthalter, a kind of ad hoc substitute governor. There was typically a Statthalter only in times of regency or absence of the Duchy's ruler, and he became particularly important during the period 1520‚Äì1534, when the occupying Habsburgs attempted to rule the Duchy in the absence of Emperors Charles V and Ferdinand. He maintained close ties with Austria, summoning the Estates often to consent to new taxation and to raise troops for Austria during the War with the Turks. Unfortunately for the Habsburgs, the tenures of the Statthalter tended to be short. Despite this, their office would continue into the second reign of Duke Ulrich and would become especially important in the regency of Duke Ludwig. Beneath the councilors were the secretaries, clerks, and accountants who ran the bureaucracy of the Duchy and adhered to a strict discipline and worked long hours. These men held no political power of their own, but often, this was the starting place for burghers looking to climb the ladder. Secretaries and clerks (Schreiber) copied and filed important documents for the various branches of the government. The growth of the central government's bureaucracy also meant the number of clerks growing from 25 in 1520 to over 80 by the end of the century. Accountants too grew in number, as the number of bookkeepers (Buchhalter), charged with maintaining a general ledger to recording and writing summaries of votes cast in privy council meetings, would be expanded greatly to fill the needs of the government. Other low-level positions included the keeper of the treasury (Gew√∂hlbeverwater), who curated the goods of the treasury vault such as government archives, and the message supervisor (Botenmeister), who managed the couriers of the Duchy. =The Estates= The Estates (Landschaft), the largest political body in the Duchy, were an entity that had existed even before the founding of the Duchy (The first assembly of the Estates, called a Landtag, occurred in Leonberg in 1457 when Count Ulrich V summoned the notables of the towns to counterbalance the attending knights (Ritterschaft)), and it consisted of representatives from several different estates (St√§nde): the prelates, nobles, and burgher officials. The prelates were the abbots of the fourteen monasteries of the Duchy, who were generally present at the diets as Ducal appointees after the Reformation. Roughly 30 noblemen, usually Ducal councilors or some other senior official, also regularly attended. Since the Estates were intended to be the representatives of the Duchy's inhabitants, about 75% of the participants of a Diet were townsfolk, though the peasantry had almost no input. The Estates had no means of imposing their will, and were to a certain extent dependent on the Duke to be effective. At times they were able to convince the Duke into reform, such as with the Treaty of T√ºbingen in 1514. During times of minority or absence of the Duke, the Estates had a large decree of control over policy and government, which they effectively lost in times of majority. Duke Ulrich, for example, rarely called Diets. Of the burghers that attended the Landtag of 1520, all of them belonged to the court and council of 44 towns, all of them Ehrbarkeit. The lack of resistance on their part to Ulrich's strong government shows that the Estates had neither a strong leader and popular support nor a permanent position in the Duchy's constitution and could be easily coerced. The Estates became useful to the Duke for the payment of his debts and for the declaration of the war, and they provided the Duchy's leading inhabitants political power and a forum to debate in. The Treaty of Esslingen in 1492, which stated that 12 members of the Estates could assume rule in times of incompetence, became the basis for following compromises between the Duke and the Estates throughout the 16th centuries. The regency of Duke Ulrich was a time of transition for the Estates, as they authored a government based on collegiate principle, with four nobles acting as regents and two prelates as advisers. The Estates voiced the interests of the towns to the regency, but during the Swabian War this regency became opposed to the wishes of the local burghers, among whom the war was very unpopular. The Estates would continue to vote more men and money to the war, which would end in defeat for the Swabian League. The Estates would continue to exercise their right to approve taxation to the Duchy's frequent wars, a right that would be extremely tested during Ulrich's reign. Economy Despite its urbanization, the Duchy's economy was very agricultural, its most important product being wine. The peasantry harvested such grains as rye, barley, hay, and oats. Other products, wool, wood, cloth, linen, and glass and metal wares, followed in importance. Frequent trading partners were the Duchy's neighbors, mostly including the south western Imperial cities like Esslingen am Neckar and Reutlingen, and the Swiss Confederation. The cities of Basel and Solothurn would also regularly extended loans to the Dukes of W√ºrttemberg. Though it had no central business hub like Ulm or Strasbourg, the Duchy was a breadbasket for its neighbors. Culture =Music= The W√ºrttemberg Hofkapelle, a term both describing the court chapel as well as the group that played within it, was founded by Duke Eberhard II during his short reign of the Duchy of W√ºrttemberg. The rules of the Baroque dukes, Eberhard Louis, Charles Alexander, and Charles Eugene, were an unstable period in the musical scene in the Duchy based at the palaces of Ludwigsburg and Stuttgart (much like the Dukes that patronized those arts) that illuminates three central themes in the history of music in the West: the emergence of the orchestra, importance of chamber music and the growing number of Italian composers and musicians employed at the courts of German princes in the 18th century. Although the Duchy was recognized by Peter H. Wilson as \\"one of the weaker middle ranking territories within the Empire,\\" the Dukes went to great - and expensive - lengths by the Ducal Court to be ahead of the cultural curve. The result, in the final years of the 17th century, was an increasing awareness and then desire for French style and fashion, resulting in the employment of French musicians, adoption of new Baroque woodwinds, putting on of large-scale French-style ballets de cour called Singballete and the institution of a Lullian string band that paved the way for appearance of the orchestra at court. Even in the face of periodic French aggression in the 18th century, Duke Eberhard Louis, educated with French style and mannerisms, strove to make his court a haven for French culture. At the turn of the 18th century, W√ºrttemberg's musical interests, like many other European states, began turning to Italy, which can be seen in the productions of Johann Sigismund Kusser from 1698 to 1702. Musical funding would unfortunately come to a sudden end with the War of Spanish Succession and it would have an indelible impact on music at the court in later years. While very little documentation of the musical activity of the first decade of the 18th century, we know that by 1715, the membership of the Duchy's Hofkapelle was three concertmasters (), 22 instrumentalists, 11 vocalists, and two choirboys () as well as an additional complement of seven trumpeters and a single kettledrummer. Two of those Kapellmeisters, Theodor Schwartzkopf and Johann Georg Christian St√∂rl, Schwartzkopf's former pupil. These two men had a falling out and St√∂rl attempted to have Schwartzkopf and his family ejected from the Kapellhaus, claiming that his residence was unsuitable for the practice of opera. In truth, the small Old Castle was already too small for the Duke's musical retinue, as was noted by the two Kapellmeister. While in Munich during the winter of 1705‚Äì06 following the defeat of Elector Maximilian II Emanuel and his brother, Joseph Clemens, Elector-archbishop of Cologne, after their defeat at defeat at Blenheim in 1704 and subsequent exile to France in 1706, he learned of the Catholic musician and composer Johann Christoph Pez, a Catholic, who now was in charge of instructing the Wittelsbach children in music. Emperor Charles VI released the entire musical ensemble of the Imperial fugitives by decree in May 1706, and Eberhard Louis hired Pez as Senior concert master () of the W√ºrttemberg Hofkapelle, above both St√∂rl and Schwartzkopf. Pez expanded the size of the Hofkapelle, particularly the number of instruments used by the court and the number of court musicians who could pay more than one instrument, but also dramatically shrank the importance of the Kapellknaben to the point where only two were employed by the court. This growth happened in spite of the ongoing War of the Spanish Succession and even Villars's invasion of the Duchy in 1707 (which caused the Ducal family to temporarily flee to Switzerland) finally ended in 1709 when the Duke, increasingly short on cash because of the war and the construction of Ludwigsburg Palace, issued a massive retrenchment that dramatically shrank the Hofkapelle. This strain would still be felt in 1714, and Pez commented:Owens 2011, p. 168 Despite its small size and financial strain, Pez was still very proud of the quality of his instrumentalists, however he worried about his vocalists, who were not numerous and contained many Catholic members who would at times not be present, exacerbating the problem.Owens 2011, p. 169 W√ºrttemberg, unlike other Lutheran German courts, found a semi-solution to a shortage of treble voices in the hiring of a succession of young, unmarried called Legr-Discantistinnen or Kapelleknaben (despite the masculinity of the term) who would receive music training with the expectation that they would become permanent members of the W√ºrttemberg establishment with an equal salary to the choirboys. It is also likely that female vocalists formed part of a French com√∂dianten from 1713 to 1716 in a nod to the large-scale theatrical performances of the early days that the Duke called off and never returned to because of the vast amounts of money lost in the stay of Johann Sigismund Kusser in Stuttgart, and Pez (according to his own word) was required to practice with and compose for this group for many hours. This group would perform in the celebrations of the Duke's hunting order, founded in 1702 and named after St. Hubert, that became one of the most important events in court life as the 18th century moved ahead, with Pez and the various components of the participating Hofkapelle lodged in and around Ludwigsburg Palace. By the second decade of the 18th century, the Singballete and operas used to celebrate previous ducal birthdays had been replaced with smaller presentations. This coincided with the shift of opinion in the court as to what extent chamber music () was able to portray a ruler's wealth and sophistication and the perceptible increase in instrumental specialization in the Hofkapelle (a phenomenon also present at larger German courts), which may have been effected by the employment of foreign musicians. This process was brought about by the formalization of service at the Ducal family's country estates. By 1715, this began to cause financial hardship in Stuttgart, as the ecclesiastical bodies whom fronted the salaries of the Hofkapelle made known their disdain for paying a clearly secular facet of the court. To reduce this strain, a rotational system wherein a copyist and pianist were on call at all times with three groups consisting of a violinist, an oboist, and a string bass player alternating every four weeks. These musicians were simply referred to as \\"court and chamber musicians,\\" weren't appointed at a higher rank, and they were paid differently. Chamber music began to be considered a major part of the court's musical establishment, on par even with church and table music, as evidenced by various documents following Pez's death (25 September 1716) in May 1717 from Schwartzkopf and St√∂rl that confirmed Pez's view of the Hofkapelle as a pool of multi-talented musicians who could play a wide range of instruments, and the hiring of violinist and virtuoso Giuseppe Antonio Brescianello as \\"director of chamber music\\" about a month after Pez's death. By the end of 1717, the concept of an orchestra as an institution began to solidify at the court. =University= The University of T√ºbingen was established by the ruling dynasty in 1477. Religion In the 16th century, W√ºrttemberg became one of three competing southwest Imperial states vying for greater status in the region and the Empire at large. Itself Lutheran, W√ºrttemberg sparred with the Roman Catholic Duchy of Lorraine and the Calvinist Electoral Palatinate. W√ºrttemberg found allies in north and east Germany because of its Lutheran faith. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries Pietism became widespread throughout the Duchy as a response to the perceived hedonism of Baroque society and attempt at a French absolutist state. They interpreted the social and natural calamities faced by the W√ºrttemberg as God's punishment for the immorality of the Ducal court and society and worked to uphold the Estates of W√ºrttemberg and co-operation between it and the Duke. After the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht that ended the War of the Spanish Succession, the Duchy enjoyed a period of peace and increasing fortune, and W√ºrttemberg Pietism's character shifted from moral and philosophical criticism of society to quiet theological contemplation.

The circular paintings in the centre of painted vases of that period are known as tondi, and the inside of the broad low winecup called a kylix also lent itself to circular enframed compositions.E.

In Ford Madox Brown's painting The Last of England, the ship's wire railing curving round the figures helps enclose the composition within its tondo shape. The background scene is consolidated or omitted, and to a large extent, unimportant. While the background may be visible in tondo paintings, in tondo relief carvings the background is not seen. Andrea della Robbia and other members of his family created glazed terracotta tondi that were often framed in a wreath of fruit and leaves and which were intended for immuring in a stuccoed wall. In Brunelleschi's Hospital of the Innocents, Florence, 1421‚Äì24, Andrea della Robbia provided glazed terracotta babes in swaddling clothes in tondos with plain blue backgrounds to be set in the spandrels of the arches. In the sixteenth century the painterly style of istoriato decoration for maiolica wares was applied to large circular dishes (see also charger). The tondo has also been used as a design element in architecture since the Renaissance; it may serve centred in the gable-end of a pediment or under the round-headed arch that was revived in the fifteenth century. Although the earliest true Renaissance, or late Gothic painted tondo is Burgundian, from Champmol (of a Piet√° by Jean Malouel of 1400‚Äì1415, now in the Louvre), the tondo became fashionable in 15th-century Florence, with Botticelli painting many examples, both Madonnas and narrative scenes. Michelangelo employed the circular tondo for several compositions, both painted and sculpted, including The Holy Family with the infant St. John the Baptist, the Doni Tondo at the Uffizi, as did Raphael.

This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation. It can be found in Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Coniochaeta hoffmannii is a plant pathogen that commonly inhabits fertile soil. It is known to metabolize aromatic compounds of low molecular weight, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid. = Glycosylation = The enzyme 4-hydroxybenzoate 4-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase transforms UDP-glucose and 4-hydroxybenzoate into UDP and 4-(beta-D-glucosyloxy)benzoate. It can be found in the pollen of Pinus densiflora.  Chemistry  The Hammett equation describes a linear free-energy relationship relating reaction rates and equilibrium constants for many reactions involving benzoic acid derivatives with meta- and para-substituents. = Chemical production = 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid is produced commercially from potassium phenoxide and carbon dioxide in the Kolbe-Schmitt reaction.Edwin Ritzer and Rudolf Sundermann \\"Hydroxycarboxylic Acids, Aromatic\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. It can also be produced in the laboratory by heating potassium salicylate with potassium carbonate to 240 ¬∞C, followed by treating with acid. = Chemical reactions = 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid has about one tenth the acidity of benzoic acid, having an acid dissociation constant Ka = 3.3 x 10‚àí5 M at 19 ¬∞C. Its acid dissociation follows this equation: :HOC6H4CO2H ‚áå HOC6H4CO2‚àí \\\\+ H+ = Chemical use = Vectran is a manufactured fiber, spun from a liquid crystal polymer. Chemically it is an aromatic polyester produced by the polycondensation of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and 6-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid. The fiber has been shown to exhibit strong radiation shielding used by Bigelow Aerospace and produced by StemRad.https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/robert- bigelow-visio-future-living-space-180958698/ 4,4'-Dihydroxybenzophenone is generally prepared by the rearrangement of p-hydroxyphenylbenzoate. Alternatively, p-hydroxybenzoic acid can be converted to p-acetoxybenzoyl chloride. This acid chloride reacts with phenol to give, after deacetylation, 4,4'-dihydroxybenzophenone. Examples of drugs made from PHBA include: 1) Nifuroxazide, 2) Orthocaine, 3) Ormeloxifene & 4) Proxymetacaine.  Bioactivity and safety  4-Hydroxybenzoic acid is a popular antioxidant in part because of its low toxicity. The is 2200 mg/kg in mice (oral). 4-Hydroxybenzoic acid has estrogenic activity both in vitro and in vivo, and stimulates the growth of human breast cancer cell lines. It is a common metabolite of paraben esters, such as methylparaben. The compound is a relatively weak estrogen, but can produce uterotrophy with sufficient doses to an equivalent extent relative to estradiol, which is unusual for a weakly estrogenic compound and indicates that it may be a full agonist of the estrogen receptor with relatively low binding affinity for the receptor. It is about 500- to 100-fold less potent as an estrogen than estradiol.

The oldest prototype on it could be found in Laurentian Chronicle. The legend The fairy tale of Nikita tells that a dragon, Zmey Gorynych, used to attack the lands of Rus and take beautiful girls as prisoners. One day he even kidnapped the daughter of the Kievan prince. To find out the dragon's weakness, the woman pretended to fall in love with him. Gorynych revealed to her there was only one person that could defeat him: a tanner from Kiev named Nikita. The princess told this to her pigeon, who alerted her father, the prince. The prince went to the tanner's house to ask for help. It took the prince a while to persuade Nikita into fighting, and the bogatyr refused the wealth and power that the prince offered him. Eventually, the prince gathered hundreds of children in front of Nikita's house, and they begged the bogatyr to save them from Gorynych's attacks. Only then Nikita agreed to fight. Nikita then went to Gorynych's lair, and, after a long fight, had the dragon heavily beaten with his heavy wooden club. Frightened, the dragon offered Nikita to become allies and rule the world together. Nikita demanded that they plow the border of their halves of the world, then used the dragon instead of a plowing horse. After they plowed the furrow across the whole world, Nikita demanded that they plow further to divide the sea as well. The foolish Gorynych obeyed and drowned in the ocean.

He is the younger brother of former WHL player Darby Walker and cousin of former AHL goaltender Mike Walker. Playing career Walker was drafted by the St. Louis Blues in the 3rd round of the 1998 NHL Entry Draft, 83rd overall. He spent the first ten years of his professional career with both the Blues and their American Hockey League affiliates, the Worcester IceCats and the Peoria Rivermen. After having played 153 games in the league he finally notched his first NHL goal on February 17, 2008 while the Blues were hosting the Columbus Blue Jackets. On July 1, 2009, he signed a four-year, $6.8 million deal with the Tampa Bay Lightning. On July 19, 2010 Walker was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, along with a 4th-round pick in the 2011 NHL Entry Draft, in exchange for forward Simon Gagne.http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/frequentflyers/Flyers_trade_Gagne_to_Tampa_Bay.html Walker's three years in Philadelphia were marred by hip and back injuries, playing in only eight games with the Flyers and 44 games with the Flyers' AHL affiliate, the Adirondack Phantoms. He missed the entire season due to a back injury. Post retirement In 2014, Walker moved to Nelson, British Columbia and bought the Nelson Brewing Company with his wife in 2016.

Optical tomography is used mostly in medical imaging research. Optical tomography in industry is used as a sensor of thickness and internal structure of semiconductors.^ Wojtek J. Walecki and Fanny Szondy, \\"Integrated quantum efficiency, reflectance, topography and stress metrology for solar cell manufacturing\\", Sunrise Optical LLC, Proc. SPIE 7064, 70640A (2008); Principle Optical tomography relies on the object under study being at least partially light-transmitting or translucent, so it works best on soft tissue, such as breast and brain tissue. The high scatter-based attenuation involved is generally dealt with by using intense, often pulsed or intensity modulated, light sources, and highly sensitive light sensors, and the use of infrared light at frequencies where body tissues are most transmissive. Soft tissues are highly scattering but weakly absorbing in the near-infrared and red parts of the spectrum, so that this is the wavelength range usually used. Types A variant of optical tomography uses optical time-of-flight sampling as an attempt to distinguish transmitted light from scattered light. This concept has been used in several academic and commercial systems for breast cancer imaging and cerebral measurement. The key to separation of absorption from scatter is the use of either time-resolved or frequency domain data which is then matched with a diffusion theory based estimate of how the light propagated through the tissue. The measurement of time of flight or frequency domain phase shift is essential to allow separation of absorption from scatter with reasonable accuracy. In fluorescence tomography, the fluorescence signal transmitted through the tissue is normalized by the excitation signal transmitted through the tissue, and so many of the fluorescence tomography systems do not require the use of time-resolved or frequency domain data, although research is still ongoing in this area. Since the applications of fluorescent molecules in humans are fairly limited, most of the work in fluorescence tomography has been in the realm of pre-clinical cancer research. Both commercial systems and academic research have been shown to be effective in tracking tumor protein expression and production, and tracking response to therapies.

It is a straightforward recursive, nondeterministic, depth-first, backtracking algorithm used by Donald Knuth to demonstrate an efficient implementation called DLX, which uses the dancing links technique. The exact cover problem is represented in Algorithm X by a matrix A consisting of 0s and 1s. The goal is to select a subset of the rows such that the digit 1 appears in each column exactly once. Algorithm X functions as follows: :{ border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\"  # If the matrix A has no columns, the current partial solution is a valid solution; terminate successfully. # Otherwise choose a column c (deterministically). # Choose a row r such that Ar, c = 1 (nondeterministically). # Include row r in the partial solution. # For each column j such that Ar, j = 1, #: for each row i such that Ai, j = 1, #:: delete row i from matrix A. #: delete column j from matrix A. # Repeat this algorithm recursively on the reduced matrix A. } The nondeterministic choice of r means that the algorithm recurses over independent subalgorithms; each subalgorithm inherits the current matrix A, but reduces it with respect to a different row r. If column c is entirely zero, there are no subalgorithms and the process terminates unsuccessfully. The subalgorithms form a search tree in a natural way, with the original problem at the root and with level k containing each subalgorithm that corresponds to k chosen rows. Backtracking is the process of traversing the tree in preorder, depth first. Any systematic rule for choosing column c in this procedure will find all solutions, but some rules work much better than others. To reduce the number of iterations, Knuth suggests that the column-choosing algorithm select a column with the smallest number of 1s in it. Example For example, consider the exact cover problem specified by the universe U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} and the collection of sets \\\\mathcal{S} = {A, B, C, D, E, F}, where: :* A = {1, 4, 7}; :* B = {1, 4}; :* C = {4, 5, 7}; :* D = {3, 5, 6}; :* E = {2, 3, 6, 7}; and :* F = {2, 7}.

F  0  1  0  0  0  0  1 } Algorithm X with Knuth's suggested heuristic for selecting columns solves this problem as follows: Level 0 Step 1‚ÄîThe matrix is not empty, so the algorithm proceeds. Step 2‚ÄîThe lowest number of 1s in any column is two. Column 1 is the first column with two 1s and thus is selected (deterministically): :{ border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" ! !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 - !

Implementations Donald Knuth's main purpose in describing Algorithm X was to demonstrate the utility of dancing links. Knuth showed that Algorithm X can be implemented efficiently on a computer using dancing links in a process Knuth calls \\"DLX\\". DLX uses the matrix representation of the exact cover problem, implemented as doubly linked lists of the 1s of the matrix: each 1 element has a link to the next 1 above, below, to the left, and to the right of itself. (Technically, because the lists are circular, this forms a torus). Because exact cover problems tend to be sparse, this representation is usually much more efficient in both size and processing time required. DLX then uses dancing links to quickly select permutations of rows as possible solutions and to efficiently backtrack (undo) mistaken guesses. See also *Exact cover *Dancing Links References *.

With a medieval heritage of scholarly activities in Douai, the university was established in 1559 and lectures started in 1562. It closed from 1795 to 1808. In 1887, it was transferred as University of Lille 27 km away from Douai. From the mid-16th century onwards, the university of Douai had Europe-wide influence as a prominent centre of neo-Latin literature, contributing also to the dissemination of printed knowledge. With 1,500 to 2,000 registered students and several hundred professors, it was the second largest university of France during the late-17th and 18th centuries. Studies in mathematics and physics at the Douai Faculty of Arts enabled broad development in artillery practice. The Douai Faculty of Theology was an important center for Catholic scholarship. It played a role in religious doctrines and political controversies in Europe; its scholars participated in the development of new approaches to the humanities. History Map (1786): Location of the university of Douai, with regards to the cities of Paris, Lille, Brussels and Leuven = Douai, scholar pole from the late Middle Ages to the Renaissance = Before the formal establishment of a university, scholarly traditions in Douai dated back to the late Middle Ages. Near Douai, Anchin Abbey was an important cultural center from the 11th century to the 13th century, producing many manuscripts and charters; it was rivalled by the scriptoria of Marchiennes Abbey and Flines Abbey. In addition to the scholarly activities at these abbeys, there were other monastic houses in Douai, thus ensuring during the 16th century that \\"close to the city, several very rich abbeys could provide space and resources to the new university\\". The bonds of vassalage tying the County of Flanders to the Kingdom of France were abolished in 1526, with Flanders becoming an imperial province under the Treaty of Madrid (1526), signed by King Francis I of France and Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, and confirmed by the Treaty of Cambrai (1529). It is therefore to the emperor that the magistrates of Douai sent a request in 1531 to create a university in the town. Formal approval of the university was only granted during the reign of Philip II of Spain, due to the evolving political and religious context. = Old university of Douai (1559‚Äì1795) = Willem Hessels van Est (Estius) (1542‚Äì1613) William Allen (cardinal) (1532‚Äì1594) Francis Sylvius (1581‚Äì1649) Cornelius a Lapide (1567‚Äì1637) Anton Sander (1586‚Äì1664) Charles Carroll the Settler (1661‚Äì1720) Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai (1754‚Äì1838) Georges Palante (1862‚Äì1925) Establishment of the university (1559)  As part of a general programme of consolidation of the Spanish Low Countries, in 1559‚Äì1562 a university was first established in the town by Philip II, in some sense a sister-university to Leuven University, founded in 1426. The foundation was confirmed by a Bull of Pope Paul IV on 31 July 1559, confirmed by Pope Pius IV on 6 January 1560. The letters patent of Philip II, dated 19 January 1561, authorized five faculties: Theology, Canon Law, Civil Law, Medicine, and Arts. The formal inauguration took place on 5 October 1562, when there was a public procession of the Blessed Sacrament, and a sermon was preached in the market-place by Fran√ßois Richardot, the Bishop of Arras. The university's first chancellor was the Englishman Richard Smith. Recent studies are coming to view the 16th century foundation of the University of Douai as an important institution of its time, and efforts are being made to reconstruct a portrait of the different aspects of its life, including prosopographies of its professors and students, especially for its Habsburg period. College du Roi (1562), College d'Anchin (1568) and College de Marchiennes (1570)  The first university college established at Douai was the \\"College du Roi\\" (King's college), which opened in 1562. A second college was established in 1564 but was replaced by the College d'Anchin (1568). Another college supported by the Abbey of Marchiennes opened in 1570. These colleges were not only places of accommodation for students but also places of lectures. Royal appointed lecturers represent only a tenth of the three hundred teachers in the faculty. The faculty of the Jesuit College included up to 145 teachers and was considered as the most important center of power in the university. English College in Douai (1562‚Äì1793)  Although the university was founded on the model of Louvain, from which it also drew the majority of the first professors, it also felt the influence of the English in its early years, several of the chief posts being held by Englishmen, mostly from Oxford. This makes it reasonable to suppose that many of the traditions of Catholic Oxford were perpetuated at Douai. The University's first Chancellor was Dr Richard Smyth, former Fellow of Merton College, Oxford and Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. The Regius Professor of Canon Law at Douai for many years was Dr Owen Lewis, a former Fellow of New College, Oxford who had held the corresponding post at Oxford. The first principal of Marchiennes College was Richard White (Richard Gwyn), another former Fellow of New College, while after taking his licentiate at Douai in 1560, William Allen became Regius Professor of Divinity there.That is, the holder of a chair founded by King Philip II of Spain, and not a Regius Professor of the kind at Oxford and Cambridge. The founding of the University of Douai coincided with the presence of a large number of English Catholics living at Douai, in the wake of the accession of Elizabeth I and the reimposition of Protestantism in England. This presence, and the role of the University prompted William Allen to found a seminary in Douai in 1569 for English Catholic priests, whose studies were in part linked to the University and who were trained there to return to their country. It was at this English College at Douai that the English translation of the Bible known as the Douay-Rheims Version was completed in 1609. The first English Catholic Bible incorporating the Rheims New Testament and the Douay Old Testament in a single volume was not printed until 1764.  Scottish College in Douai (1573‚Äì1802) The Scottish College was established in 1573 by bishop John Lesley, who objected to the Scottish Reformation and to destabilization of the Auld Alliance between France and Scotland by Protestant England. It was refounded in 1608. After Douai's conquest by the French, the Scots living there automatically had dual French and Scots citizenship under the Auld Alliance. The college in Douai hosted scholars from the Scottish Stuart supporter movement and also refugees from Jacobite risings, especially between 1688 and 1692. Historical collections were left there by king James II of England and VII of Scotland (last Catholic monarch of Great Britain) and by exiled Scottish Catholics.  Irish College in Douai (1603‚Äì1905) St. Patrick Irish college of Douai was founded in 1603 by Christopher Cusack, with the support of Philip III of Spain, an ally of the Irish Catholics against the colonization of Ireland by the English power. Hugh √ì Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, leader of the Irish resistance during the Nine Years' War in Ireland, stayed at Douai university on his way to exile from Ireland to Rome in 1607. The Irish College was attached to the Faculty of Theology of the University of Douai in 1610.  Bronchorst scholarship foundation (1629) By his will dated 20 June 1629, Henry Bronchorst founded a scholarship for a period of nine years for members of the Seven noble houses of Brussels to study at the University of Douai, which explains the significant number of members of the Brussels magistrate who were educated at this university. Other foundations The town was a vibrant centre of Catholic life and connected with the University were not only the English College, but also the Irish and Scottish colleges (i.e. seminaries), and Benedictine, Jesuit and Franciscan houses. For a time there was also a Charterhouse. The Coll√®ge d'Anchin was opened a few months after the English College, endowed by the Abbot of the neighbouring monastery of Anchin, and entrusted to the Jesuits. In 1570 the Abbot of Marchiennes founded a college for the study of law. The Abbot of Saint-Vast founded a college of that name. Later on, we find the College of St. Thomas Aquinas, belonging to the Dominicans, the Coll√®ge du Roi, and others. The Benedictines established a college at Douai, founded by Augustine Bradshaw in 1605, in hired apartments belonging to the Coll√®ge d'Anchin, but a few years later, through the generosity of Philippe de Caverel, Abbot of the monastery of Saint-Vaast, they obtained land and built a monastery, which was opened in 1611. The house acquired a high reputation for learning, being rebuilt between 1776 and 1781, and many of the professors of the university were at different times chosen from among its members. (The Anglo-Benedictines went into English exile on the French Revolution and were the only Douai institution to retain their ancient monastery after it; and as the community of St Gregory was then permanently established at Downside, they handed over their house at Douai to the community of St Edmund, which had formerly been located in Paris. These Benedictines carried on a school at Douai until 1903, when Waldeck-Rousseau's 1901 Law of Associations caused them to leave France. They returned to England, and settled at Woolhampton, near Reading, founding Douai Abbey there, known for its school ‚Äì Douai School ‚Äì which closed in 1999.) The Benedictine and Franciscan houses at Douai were near together and were both bound up in their history with the restoration of the respective orders in England. The Franciscan monastery was founded mainly through the instrumentality of Father John Gennings, the brother of the martyr, Edmund Gennings. It was established in temporary quarters in 1618, the students for the time attending the Jesuit schools; but by 1621 they had built a monastery and provided for all necessary tuition within their own walls. Heyday Something of the feel of the university's quality can be gained from the work of some of its professors. Among them were Estius (Willem Hessels van Est), (1542‚Äì1613), the commentator on the Pauline epistles. He had studied classics at Utrecht and afterwards spent some twenty years at Louvain, in the study of philosophy, theology and Holy Scripture, and in 1580 received the degree of Doctor of Theology. In 1582 he became Professor of Theology at Douai, a position which he retained for thirty-one years and which he combined for the last eighteen years of his life with that of Chancellor of the University, in addition to being for many years rector of the diocesan seminary. Estius's works were written in Latin and for the greater part published posthumously. In the 18th century, the University of Douai was the second largest in the kingdom of France by number of students, with a total student registration ranging between 1,500 and 2,000. Closed university during the French Revolution (1795‚Äì1808) The university was suppressed during the French Revolution and its libraries' holdings transferred to the town's Biblioth√®que Municipale (founded by Louis XV in 1767), which also received the collections of the Jesuits of the College of Anchin. A good part of these collections was however destroyed when the library was burnt as a consequence of bombardment on August 11, 1944, in the aftermath of the World War II Normandy landings. =Modern university of Douai (1808‚Äì1887)= Douai Faculties of Letters and sciences were re-established in 1808. Douai regained a Faculty of Law in 1854,Louis Pasteur, Discours prononc√© √† Douai, le 7 d√©cembre 1854. Installation solennelle de la facult√© des lettres de Douai et de la Facult√© des sciences de Lille. Douai: A. d'Aubers, 1854. but in 1887 this was transferred to Lille. Currently the University of Lille and the \\"Artois University\\" who make up a part of the Community of Universities and Institutions Lille Nord de France regard themselves as successors to Philip II's University of Douai. = Transformation as University of Lille (1896) = In 1887, all faculties in Douai are relocated in the neighbouring city of Lille. University of Lille is then established in 1896 with all faculties including sciences, law, medicine and pharmacy, literature and humanities.  Faculties  = Faculties of the old university of Douai =  Faculty of Arts (1562‚Äì1795) The Faculty of Arts in Douai had intense activity and conferred Master of Arts degrees, which was a prerequisite to study theology and law. Just as in Louvain and Paris universities, this MA degree from the Faculty of Arts was the first and mandatory step before undertaking studies in other faculties. Its fame was in philosophy and mathematics, through (or in competition with) the Jesuit college in particular. \\"The Faculty of Arts offers three chairs (history, Hebrew, Greek) until 1704, when a chair of mathematics was created (...). A chair in hydrography has been in place since 1704.\\" \\"In the faculties, it is the mathematics in the sixteenth century, and the reshaping of this chair by the Marquis de Pommereuil in 1705 that gives new shine to optics, geometry, astronomy, architecture, military use of alloy chemistry, trigonometry, so as to train good officers. Mathematics and science in Douai were illustrated by the mathematician Charles Malapert in the early seventeenth century, who discovered sunspots probably before Kirchner, whom he met in Ingolstadt, and in the second half of the century by Anthony Thomas, a Jesuit successor of Verbiest in China, to chair the tribunal of Mathematics in Beijing. This correspondent of the Academy of Sciences has left a major work.\\" In 1679 the first school for artillery officers in France was established in Douai by King Louis XIV. \\"In the eighteenth century (...) in philosophy, Douai faculty gave preference to the mathematical logic. Hence the growth in this area of knowledge in the program included (...) physics: mechanics, mathematics, physics itself, optics, perspective, astronomy, cosmography, elements of natural history (chemistry, history, geography, philology). This maths focus was major to train military land and navy officers; Douai also possessed a rich library, a museum of ethnology and archeology and a museum of natural sciences (...) Despite the Church distrust regarding sciences, Douai followed closely the developments of science, which stimulated discoveries.\\" It was not until 1750 that the French language supplanted, but not completely, Latin, which had persisted until the French Revolution. By the French law of 8 Prairial IV (1795), it is in the neighbouring city of Lille and not in Douai that an Ecole centrale de Lille was established, as a successor of Douai Faculty of Art. Douai itself regained a faculty of sciences only in 1808.  Faculty of Theology (1562‚Äì1793)  Douay-Rheims Bible (1582‚Äì1609) It is in this faculty that the Douay-Rheims Bible was established. Three two-year course at the Faculty of Theology ensure the successive grades of bachelor, licentiate and doctor. We can have an idea of the quality of the university in what were seeing what some of his professors. Among the most famous, who are many, just to cite Estius (1542‚Äì1613), the famous commentator of the epistles of Paul. After classical studies at Utrecht, he then spent two decades in Leuven, studying philosophy, theology and Scripture and in 1580 he received the degree of doctor of theology. In 1582 he became professor of theology at Douai, a position he held for thirty-one years, and he joined her in the last eighteen years of his life with that of Chancellor of the university, while also being the many years rector of the diocesan seminary. The works of Estius were written in Latin and for the most part, their publications were posthumous. Note also Lessius Leonardus (1554‚Äì1623), professing the philosophy, and Fran√ßois du Bois, said Franciscus Sylvius (1581‚Äì1649) [38], professor of theology and vice-chancellor of the university, but also Nemius Gaspard Dubois, George Colveneere, and Philippe Bossuet Cosp√©an which involved in the controversy of Douai. Major doctrinal debates have taken place within the Faculty of Theology, first Gallicanism opponents with the D√©claration des Quatre articles that originally was opposed at Douai in 1683, then between Jesuits and Jansenists. After the first European fame instilled by Estius, \\"the Faculty of Theology is the most prestigious of all, Ren√© Descartes goes there several times to discuss his Discourse on the Method with academics, Francis Sylvius especially\\", the One of the greatest theologians of his century and the first ornament of the university, which took part against the Augustinus of the Bishop of Ypres, Jansenius. [40] Pro-Jansenius academics were exiled by lettre de cachet in 1692 in an episode referred to as the Fourberie de Douai (Cheating of Douai).  Faculty of Law (1562‚Äì1795)  The faculties of canon law and civil law had an intense activity from the establishment of the University of Douai to the French Revolution. The Parliament of Flanders seat at Douai from 1713 and subsequently became the Court of Appeal of Douai, which encourages law schools in Douai. One student emblematic of Douai law faculty is Philippe-Antoine Merlin de Douai. Law schools have trained many lawyers in Flanders, such as Adrian Maillart, Fran√ßois Modius, Fran√ßois Patou, Jacques Pollet, Mathieu Pinault, Cesar Baggio and Bertrand Cahuac.  Faculty of Medicine (1562‚Äì1793)  Tables anatomiques ‚Äì Am√© Bourdon (1678) The faculty of medicine in Douai lives in the shadow of other more famous faculties, but is not at the tip of his time: it has a medical anatomical theater as early as 1700 . The names of Am√© Bourdon for surgery and anatomy, Michel Brisseau in ophthalmology and Jean-Baptiste Lestiboudois in medicine and botany reflect the teachings at the Faculty of Medicine. In 1805, a school of medicine was establied in Lille, as the successor of the school of surgery founded in Lille in 1705. It overshadowed medical education in Douai. Its heir is now part of the University of Lille. = Faculties of the modern university of Douai =  Faculty of sciences (1808‚Äì1815)  A faculty of sciences was re-established in 1808. However, higher education in sciences moved to Lille and its faculty of sciences inaugurated by Louis Pasteur. Its heir is today part of the University of Lille.  Faculty of Law (1854‚Äì1887)  The faculty of law in Douai was moved to Lille in 1887. Its heir is today part of the University of Lille.  Faculty of literature (1808‚Äì1815, 1854‚Äì1887) A faculty of literature was reestablished in 1808 and transferred to Lille in 1887. Its heir today is part of the University of Lille.  Influence of the university of Douai  = Dissemination of printed knowledge = Douai was a prominent center of neo-Latin literature. Douai was known not only for his intellectual activity, but also for his many master printers, involved in the dissemination of knowledge primarily in Latin, but also in French in the southern Netherlands. = Douay-Rheims Bible and catholic studies = Douay-Rheims Bible : revision by Richard Challoner (1749) Douai was an important center for Catholic Studies. When the Holy See authorized the translation of the Bible into vernacular languages, the Douay-Rheims Bible was the first authorized Catholic bible translated from Latin into English in 1609 and its subsequent revisions were references to the Catholic Bible in English . This is a Douai-Rheims Bible John Fitzgerald Kennedy took the oath as President of the United States in 1961. In seminars Douai that was formed much of the English Catholic clergy from the Counter-Reformation. The preacher trained in Douai clergy also swarmed into colonies, such as Pierre-Philippe Potier in New France, Charles Carroll Maryland Colon and Nicolas Trigault in China. =Religious and political influence = University of Douai was the center of religious debate to the political implications. Created to counter the Protestant Reformation, the court also dismissed the royal power by his fight against Bossuet and the Gallican. Its independence on the face of temporal power is due to its history on the border between the Spanish Netherlands and the Kingdom of France. The chancellors and officials of the university were advisers of the Catholic kings of Spain and France. The board of the University of Douai had relations with the courts of Louis XIV and Louis XV, including through Philip Cosp√©an and Bossuet, and was also related to Popes who originally contributed to the financial support of some of his colleagues. During the French Revolution in 1791, the clergy began university Douaisian conditions before considering to take an oath to the Civil Constitution of the clergy, following the brief quod aliquantum of March 10, 1791 and Caritas of April 13, 1791 issued by the Pope. These conditions were interpreted as a rejection of loyalty to Republican power. = Humanities and modernity = Even though many works of the 18th century encyclopaedists, such as the Encyclopedia of Diderot and D'Alembert, and later works, such as the Grand dictionnaire universal dictionary of the 19th century, were blacklisted, the university was gradually imbued with ideas of modernity, the scientific revolution and the great discoveries. Witness the early work in mathematics, and anatomy, setting default the system of Galen, and the accompanying changes in botanical and zoological classifications, respectively, studied at Douai by Richard Gibbons [53] and Charles Malapert, Ame Bourdon Jean-Baptiste Lestiboudois.

Machine perfusion has been applied to renal transplantation, liver transplantation and lung transplantation. It is an alternative to static cold storage (SCS). History of kidney preservation techniques An essential preliminary to the development of kidney storage and transplantation was the work of Carrel in developing methods for vascular anastomosis. Carrel went on to describe the first kidney transplants, which were performed in dogs in 1902; Ullman independently described similar experiments in the same year. In these experiments kidneys were transplanted without there being any attempt at storage. The crucial step in making in vitro storage of kidneys possible, was the demonstration by Fuhrman in 1943, of a reversible effect of hypothermia on the metabolic processes of isolated tissues. Prior to this, kidneys had been stored at normal body temperatures using blood or diluted blood perfusates, but no successful reimplantations had been made. Fuhrman showed that slices of rat kidney cortex and brain withstood cooling to 0.2 ¬∞C for one hour at which temperature their oxygen consumption was minimal. When the slices were rewarmed to 37 ¬∞C their oxygen consumption recovered to normal. The beneficial effect of hypothermia on ischaemic intact kidneys was demonstrated by Owens in 1955 when he showed that, if dogs were cooled to 23-26 ¬∞C, and their thoracic aortas were occluded for 2 hours, their kidneys showed no apparent damage when the dogs were rewarmed. This protective effect of hypothermia on renal ischaemic damage was confirmed by Bogardus who showed a protective effect from surface cooling of dog kidneys whose renal pedicles were clamped in situ for 2 hours. Moyer demonstrated the applicability of these dog experiments to the human, by showing the same effect on dog and human kidney function from the same periods of hypothermic ischaemia. It was not until 1958 that it was shown that intact dog kidneys would survive ischaemia even better if they were cooled to lower temperatures. Stueber showed that kidneys would survive in situ clamping of the renal pedicle for 6 hours if the kidneys were cooled to 0-5 ¬∞C by being placed in a cooling jacket, and Schloerb showed that a similar technique with cooling of heparinised dog kidneys to 2-4 ¬∞C gave protection for 8 hours but not 12 hours. Schloerb also attempted in vitro storage and auto-transplantation of cooled kidneys, and had one long term survivor after 4 hours kidney storage followed by reimplantation and immediate contralateral nephrectomy. He also had a near survivor, after 24-hour kidney storage and delayed contralateral nephrectomy, in a dog that developed a late arterial thrombosis in the kidney. These methods of surface cooling were improved by the introduction of techniques in which the kidney's vascular system was flushed out with cold fluid prior to storage. This had the effect of increasing the speed of cooling of the kidney and removed red cells from the vascular system. Kiser used this technique to achieve successful 7 hours in vitro storage of a dog kidney, when the kidney had been flushed at 5 ¬∞C with a mixture of dextran and diluted blood prior to storage. In 1960 Lapchinsky confirmed that similar storage periods were possible, when he reported 8 dogs surviving after their kidneys had been stored at 2-4 ¬∞C for 28 hours, followed by auto-transplantation and delayed contralateral nephrectomy. Although Lapchinsky gave no details in his paper, Humphries reported that these experiments had involved cooling the kidneys for 1 hour with cold blood, and then storage at 2-4 ¬∞C, followed by rewarming of the kidneys over 1 hour with warm blood at the time of reimplantation. The contralateral nephrectomies were delayed for 2 months. Humphries developed this storage technique by continuously perfusing the kidney throughout the period of storage. He used diluted plasma or serum as the perfusate and pointed out the necessity for low perfusate pressures to prevent kidney swelling, but admitted that the optimum values for such variables as perfusate temperature, Po2, and flow, remained unknown. His best results, at this time, were 2 dogs that survived after having their kidneys stored for 24 hours at 4-10 ¬∞C followed by auto-transplantation and delayed contralateral nephrectomy a few weeks later. Calne challenged the necessity of using continuous perfusion methods by demonstrating that successful 12-hour preservation could be achieved using much simpler techniques. Calne had one kidney supporting life even when the contralateral nephrectomy was performed at the same time as the reimplantation operation. Calne merely heparinised dog kidneys and then stored them in iced solution at 4 ¬∞C. Although 17-hour preservation was shown to be possible in one experiment when nephrectomy was delayed, no success was achieved with 24-hour storage. The next advance was made by Humphries in 1964, when he modified the perfusate used in his original continuous perfusion system, and had a dog kidney able to support life after 24-hour storage, even when an immediate contralateral nephrectomy was performed at the same time as the reimplantation. In these experiments autogenous blood, diluted 50% with Tis-U-Sol solution at 10 ¬∞C, was used as the perfusate. The perfusate pressure was 40 mm Hg and perfusate pH 7.11-7.35 (at 37 ¬∞C). A membrane lung was used for oxygenation to avoid damaging the blood. In attempting to improve on these results Manax investigated the effect of hyperbaric oxygen, and found that successful 48-hour storage of dog kidneys was possible at 2 ¬∞C without using continuous perfusion, when the kidneys were flushed with a dextran/Tis-U-Sol solution before storage at 7.9 atmospheres pressure, and if the contralateral nephrectomy was delayed till 2 to 4 weeks after reimplantation. Manax postulated that hyperbaric oxygen might work either by inhibiting metabolism or by aiding diffusion of oxygen into the kidney cells, but he reported no control experiments to determine whether other aspects of his model were more important than hyperbaria. A marked improvement in storage times was achieved by Belzer in 1967 when he reported successful 72-hour kidney storage after returning to the use of continuous perfusion using a canine plasma based perfusate at 8-12 ¬∞C. Belzer found that the crucial factor in permitting uncomplicated 72-hour perfusion was cryoprecipitation of the plasma used in the perfusate to reduce the amount of unstable lipo-proteins which otherwise precipitated out of solution and progressively obstructed the kidney's vascular system. A membrane oxygenator was also used in the system in a further attempt to prevent denaturation of the lipo-proteins because only 35% of the lipo-proteins were removed by cryo- precipitation. The perfusate comprised 1 litre of canine plasma, 4 mEq of magnesium sulphate, 250 ml of dextrose, 80 units of insulin, 200,000 units of penicillin and 100 mg of hydrocortisone. Besides being cryo-precipitated, the perfusate was pre-filtered through a 0.22 micron filter immediately prior to use. Belzer used a perfusate pH of 7.4-7.5, a Po2 of 150‚Äì190 mm Hg, and a perfusate pressure of 50‚Äì80 mm Hg systolic, in a machine that produced a pulsatile perfusate flow. Using this system Belzer had 6 dogs surviving after their kidneys had been stored for 72 hours and then reimplanted, with immediate contralateral nephrectomies being performed at the reimplantation operations. Belzer's use of hydrocortisone as an adjuvant to preservation had been suggested by Lotke's work with dog kidney slices, in which hydrocortisone improved the ability of slices to excrete PAH and oxygen after 30 hour storage at 2-4 ¬∞C; Lotke suggested that hydrocortisone might be acting as a lysosomal membrane stabiliser in these experiments. The other components of Belzer's model were arrived at empirically. The insulin and magnesium were used partially in an attempt to induce artificial hibernation, as Suomalainen found this regime to be effective in inducing hibernation in natural hibernators. The magnesium was also provided as a metabolic inhibitor following Kamiyama's demonstration that it was an effective agent in dog heart preservation. A further justification for the magnesium was that it was needed to replace calcium which had been bound by citrate in the plasma. Belzer demonstrated the applicability of his dog experiments to human kidney storage when he reported his experiences in human renal transplantation using the same storage techniques as he had used for dog kidneys. He was able to store kidneys for up to 50 hours with only 8% of patients requiring post operative dialysis when the donor had been well prepared. In 1968 Humphries reported 1 survivor out of 14 dogs following 5 day storage of their kidneys in a perfusion machine at 10 ¬∞C, using a diluted plasma medium containing extra fatty acids. However, delayed contralateral nephrectomy 4 weeks after reimplantation was necessary in these experiments to achieve success, and this indicated that the kidneys were severely injured during storage. In 1969 Collins reported an improvement in the results that could be achieved with simple non perfusion methods of hypothermic kidney storage. He based his technique on the observation by Keller that the loss of electrolytes from a kidney during storage could be prevented by the use of a storage fluid containing cations in quantities approaching those normally present in cells. In Collins' model, the dogs were well hydrated prior to nephrectomy, and were also given mannitol to induce a diuresis. Phenoxybenzamine, a vasodilator and lysozomal enzyme stabiliser, was injected into the renal artery before nephrectomy. The kidneys were immersed in saline immediately after removal, and perfused through the renal artery with 100-150 ml of a cold electrolyte solution from a height of 100 cm. The kidneys remained in iced saline for the rest of the storage period. The solution used for these successful cold perfusions imitated the electrolyte composition of intracellular fluids by containing large amounts of potassium and magnesium. The solution also contained glucose, heparin, procaine and phenoxybenzamine. The solution's pH was 7.0 at 25 ¬∞C. Collins was able to achieve successful 24-hour storage of 6 kidneys, and 30 hour storage of 3 kidneys, with the kidneys functioning immediately after reimplantation, despite immediate contralateral nephrectomies. Collins emphasised the poor results obtained with a Ringer's solution flush, in finding similar results with this management when compared with kidneys treated by surface cooling alone. Liu reported that Collins' solution could give successful 48-hour storage when the solution was modified by the inclusion of amino acids and vitamins. However, Liu performed no control experiments to show that these modifications were crucial. Difficulty was found by other workers in repeating Belzer's successful 72-hour perfusion storage experiments. Woods was able to achieve successful 48-hour storage of 3 out of 6 kidneys when he used the Belzer additives with cryoprecipitated plasma as the perfusate in a hypothermic perfusion system, but he was unable to extend the storage time to 72 hours as Belzer had done. However, Woods later achieved successful 3 and 7 days storage of dog kidneys. Woods had modified Belzer's perfusate by the addition of 250 mg of methyl prednisolone, increased the magnesium sulphate content to 16.2 mEq and the insulin to 320 units. Six of 6 kidneys produced life sustaining function when they were reimplanted after 72 hours storage despite immediate contralateral nephrectomies; 1 of 2 kidneys produced life sustaining function after 96 hours storage, 1 of 2 after 120 hours storage, and 1 of 2 after 168 hours storage. Perfusate pressure was 60 mm Hg with a perfusate pump rate of 70 beats per minute, and perfusate pH was automatically maintained at 7.4 by a C02 titrator. Woods stressed the importance of hydration of the donor and recipient animals. Without the methyl prednisolone, Woods found vessel fragility to be a problem when storage times were longer than 48 hours. A major simplification to the techniques of hypothermic perfusion storage was made by Johnson and Claes in 1972 with the introduction of an albumin based perfusate. This perfusate eliminated the need for the manufacture of the cryoprecipitated and millipore filtered plasma used by Belzer. The preparation of this perfusate had been laborious and time-consuming, and there was the potential risk from hepatitis virus and cytotoxic antibodies. The absence of lipo-proteins from the perfusate meant that the membrane oxygenator could be eliminated from the perfusion circuit, as there was no need to avoid a perfusate/air interface to prevent precipitation of lipo-proteins. Both workers used the same additives as recommended by Belzer. The solution that Johnson used was prepared by the Blood Products Laboratory (Elstree: England) by extracting heat labile fibrinogen and gamma globulins from plasma to give a plasma protein fraction (PPF) solution. The solution was incubated at 60 ¬∞C for 10 hours to inactivate the agent of serum hepatitis. The result was a 45 g/l human albumin solution containing small amounts of gamma and beta globulins which was stable between 0 ¬∞C and 30 ¬∞C for 5 years. PPF contained 2.2 mmol/l of free fatty acids. Johnson's experiments were mainly concerned with the storage of kidneys that had been damaged by prolonged warm injury. However, in a control group of non-warm injured dog kidneys, Johnson showed that 24-hour preservation was easily achieved when using a PPF perfusate, and he described elsewhere Johnson RWG. Studies in renal preservation. Newcastle, England: University of Newcastle, 1973. 94pp. M. S. Thesis. a survivor after 72 hours perfusion and reimplantation with immediate contralateral nephrectomy. With warm injured kidneys, PPF perfusion gave better results than Collins' method, with 6 out of 6 dogs surviving after 40 minutes warm injury and 24-hour storage followed by reimplantation of the kidneys and immediate contralateral nephrectomy. Potassium, magnesium, insulin, glucose, hydrocortisone and ampicillin were added to the PPF solution to provide an energy source and to prevent leakage of intracellular potassium. Perfusate temperature was 6 ¬∞C, pressure 40‚Äì80 mm Hg, and Po2 200‚Äì400 mm Hg. The pH was maintained between 7.2 and 7.4. Claes used a perfusate based on human albumin (Kabi: Sweden) diluted with saline to a concentration of 45 g/l. Claes preserved 4 out of 5 dog kidneys for 96 hours with the kidneys functioning immediately after reimplantation despite immediate contralateral nephrectomies. Claes also compared this perfusate with Belzer's cryoprecipitated plasma in a control group and found no significant difference between the function of the reimplanted kidneys in the two groups. The only other group besides Woods' to report successful 7 day storage of kidneys was Liu and Humphries in 1973. They had 3 out of 7 dogs surviving, after their kidneys had been stored for 7 days followed by reimplantation and immediate contralateral nephrectomy. Their best dog had a peak post reimplantation creatinine of 50 mg/l (0.44 mmol/l). Liu used well hydrated dogs undergoing a mannitol diuresis and stored the kidneys at 9 ¬∞C ‚Äì 10 ¬∞C using a perfusate derived from human PPF. The PPF was further fractionated by using a highly water-soluble polymer (Pluronic F-38), and sodium acetyl tryptophanate and sodium caprylate were added to the PPF as stabilisers to permit pasteurisation. To this solution were added human albumin, heparin, mannitol, glucose, magnesium sulphate, potassium chloride, insulin, methyl prednisolone, carbenicillin, and water to adjust the osmolality to 300-310 mosmol/kg. The perfusate was exchanged after 3.5 days storage. Perfusate pressure was 60 mm Hg or less, at a pump rate of 60 per minute. Perfusate pH was 7.12‚Äì7.32 (at 37 ¬∞C), Pco2 27‚Äì47 mm Hg, and Po2 173‚Äì219 mm Hg. In a further report on this study Humphries found that when the experiments were repeated with a new batch of PPF no survivors were obtained, and histology of the survivors from the original experiment showed glomerular hypercellularity which he attributed to a possible toxic effect of the Pluronic polymer. Joyce and Proctor reported the successful use of a simple dextran based perfusate for 72-hour storage of dog kidneys. 10 out of 17 kidneys were viable after reimplantation and immediate contralateral nephrectomy. Joyce used non pulsatile perfusion at 4 ¬∞C with a perfusate containing Dextran 70 (Pharmacia) 2.1%, with additional electrolytes, glucose (19.5 g/l), procaine and hydrocortisone. The perfusate contained no plasma or plasma components. Perfusate pressure was only 30 cm H20, pH 7.34-7.40 and Po2 250‚Äì400 mm Hg. This work showed that, for 72-hour storage, no nutrients other than glucose were needed, and low perfusate pressures and flows were adequate. In 1973 Sacks showed that simple ice storage could be successfully used for 72-hour storage when a new flushing solution was used for the initial cooling and flush out of the kidney. Sacks removed kidneys from well hydrated dogs that were diuresing after a mannitol infusion, and flushed the kidneys with 200 ml of solution from a height of 100 cm. The kidneys were then simply kept at 2 ¬∞C for 72 hours without further perfusion. Reimplantation was followed by immediate contralateral nephrectomies. The flush solution was designed to imitate intracellular fluid composition and contained mannitol as an impermeable ion to further prevent cell swelling. The osmolality of the solution was 430 mosmol/kg and its pH was 7.0 at 2 ¬∞C. The additives that had been used by Collins (dextrose, phenoxybenzamine, procaine and heparin) were omitted by Sacks. These results have been equalled by Ross who also achieved successful 72-hour storage without using continuous perfusion, although he was unable to reproduce Collins' or Sacks' results using the original Collins' or Sacks' solutions. Ross's successful solution was similar in electrolyte composition to intracellular fluid with the addition of hypertonic citrate and mannitol. No phosphate, bicarbonate, chloride or glucose were present in the solution; the osmolality was 400 mosmol/kg and the pH 7.1. Five of 8 dogs survived reimplantation of their kidneys and immediate contralateral nephrectomy, when the kidneys had been stored for 72 hours after having been flushed with Ross's solution; but Ross was unable to achieve 7 day storage with this technique even when delayed contralateral nephrectomy was used. The requirements for successful 72-hour hypothermic perfusion storage have been further defined by Collins who showed that pulsatile perfusion was not needed if a perfusate pressure of 49 mm Hg was used, and that 7 ¬∞C was a better temperature for storage than 2 ¬∞C or 12 ¬∞C. He also compared various perfusate compositions and found that a phosphate buffered perfusate could be used successfully, so eliminating the need for a carbon dioxide supply. Grundmann has also shown that low perfusate pressure is adequate. He used a mean pulsatile pressure of 20 mm Hg in 72-hour perfusions and found that this gave better results than mean pressures of 15, 40, 50 or 60 mm Hg. Successful storage up to 8 days was reported by Cohen using various types of perfusate ‚Äì with the best result being obtained when using a phosphate buffered perfusate at 8 ¬∞C. Inability to repeat these successful experiments was thought to be due to changes that had been made in the way that the PPF was manufactured with higher octanoic acid content being detrimental. Octanoic acid was shown to be able to stimulate metabolic activity during hypothermic perfusion and this might be detrimental. Nature of kidney preservation injury  =Structural injury= The structural changes that occur during 72-hour hypothermic storage of previously uninjured kidneys have been described by Mackay Mackay B, Moloney PJ, Rix DB. \\"The use of electron microscopy in renal preservation and perfusion.\\" In: Norman JC, ed. Organ perfusion and preservation. New York: Appleton Century Crofts,1968:697-714. who showed how there was progressive vacuolation of the cytoplasm of the cells which particularly affected the proximal tubules. On electron microscopy the mitochondria were seen to become swollen with early separation of the internal cristal membranes and later loss of all internal structure. Lysosomal integrity was well preserved until late, and the destruction of the cell did not appear to be caused by lytic enzymes because there was no more injury immediately adjacent to the lysosomes than in the rest of the cell. Woods and Liu ‚Äì when describing successful 5 and 7 day kidney storage - described the light microscopic changes seen at the end of perfusion and at post mortem, but found few gross abnormalities apart from some infiltration with lymphocytes and occasional tubular atrophy. The changes during short perfusions of human kidneys prior to reimplantation have been described by Hill who also performed biopsies 1 hour after reimplantation. On electron microscopy Hill found endothelial damage which correlated with the severity of the fibrin deposition after reimplantation. The changes that Hill saw in the glomeruli on light microscopy were occasional fibrin thrombi and infiltration with polymorphs. Hill suspected that these changes were an immunologically induced lesion, but found that there was no correlation between the severity of the histological lesion and the presence or absence of immunoglobulin deposits. There are several reports of the analysis of urine produced by kidneys during perfusion storage. Kastagir analysed urine produced during 24-hour perfusion and found it to be an ultrafiltrate of the perfusate, Scott found a trace of protein in the urine during 24-hour storage, and Pederson found only a trace of protein after 36 hours perfusion storage. Pederson mentioned that he had found heavy proteinuria during earlier experiments. Woods noted protein casts in the tubules of viable kidneys after 5 day storage, but he did not analyse the urine produced during perfusion. In Cohen's study there was a progressive increase in urinary protein concentration during 8 day preservation until the protein content of the urine equalled that of the perfusate. This may have been related to the swelling of the glomerular basement membranes and the progressive fusion of epithelial cell foot processes that was also observed during the same period of perfusion storage. =Mechanisms of injury= The mechanisms that damage kidneys during hypothermic storage can be sub-divided as follows: # Injury to the metabolic processes of the cell caused by: ## Cold ## Anoxia when the kidney is warm both before and after the period of hypothermic storage. ## Failure to supply the correct nutrients. ## Toxin accumulation in the perfusate. ## Toxic damage from the storage fluid. ## Washout of essential substrates from the kidney cells. # Injury to nuclear DNA. # Mechanical injury to the vascular system of the kidney during hypothermic perfusion. # Post reimplantation injury. Metabolic injury =Cold= At normal temperatures pumping mechanisms in cell walls retain intracellular potassium at high levels and extrude sodium. If these pumps fail sodium is taken up by the cell and potassium lost. Water follows the sodium passively and results in swelling of the cells. The importance of this control of cell swelling was demonstrated by McLoughlin who found a significant correlation between canine renal cortical water content and the ability of kidneys to support life after 36-hour storage. The pumping mechanism is driven by the enzyme system known as Na+K+- activated ATPase and is inhibited by cold. Levy found that metabolic activity at 10 ¬∞C, as indicated by oxygen consumption measurements, was reduced to about 5% of normal and, because all enzyme systems are affected in a similar way by hypothermia, ATPase activity is markedly reduced at 10 ¬∞C. There are, however, tissue and species differences in the cold sensitivity of this ATPase which may account for the differences in the ability of tissues to withstand hypothermia. Martin has shown that in dog kidney cortical cells some ATPase activity is still present at 10 ¬∞C but not at 0 ¬∞C. In liver and heart cells activity was completely inhibited at 10 ¬∞C and this difference in the cold sensitivity of ATPase correlated with the greater difficulty in controlling cell swelling during hypothermic storage of liver and heart cells. A distinct ATPase is found in vessel walls, and this was shown by Belzer to be completely inhibited at 10 ¬∞C, when at this temperature kidney cortical cells ATPase is still active. These experiments were performed on aortic endothelium, but if the vascular endothelium of the kidney has the same properties, then vascular injury may be the limiting factor in prolonged kidney storage. Willis has shown how hibernators derive some of their ability to survive low temperatures by having a Na+K+-ATPase which is able to transport sodium and potassium actively across their cell membranes, at 5 ¬∞C, about six times faster than in non-hibernators; this transport rate is sufficient to prevent cell swelling. The rate of cooling of a tissue may also be significant in the production of injury to enzyme systems. Francavilla showed that when liver slices were rapidly cooled (immediate cooling to 12 ¬∞C in 6 minutes) anaerobic glycolysis, as measured on rewarming to 37 ¬∞C, was inhibited by about 67% of the activity that was demonstrated in slices that had been subjected to delayed cooling. However, dog kidney slices were less severely affected by the rapid cooling than were the liver slices. =Anoxia= All cells require ATP as an energy source for their metabolic activity. The kidney is damaged by anoxia when kidney cortical cells are unable to generate sufficient ATP under anaerobic conditions to meet the needs of the cells. When excising a kidney some anoxia is inevitable in the interval between dividing the renal artery and cooling the kidney. It has been shown by Bergstrom that 50% of a dog's kidney's cortical cells ATP content is lost within 1 minute of clamping the renal artery, and similar results were found by Warnick in whole mice kidneys, with a fall in cellular ATP by 50% after about 30 seconds of warm anoxia. Warnick and Bergstrom also showed that cooling the kidney immediately after removal markedly reduced any further ATP loss. When these non warm-injured kidneys were perfused with oxygenated hypothermic plasma, ATP levels were reduced by 50% after 24-hour storage and, after 48 hours, mean tissue ATP levels were a little higher than this indicating that synthesis of ATP had occurred. Pegg has shown that rabbit kidneys can resynthesize ATP after a period of perfusion storage following warm injury, but no resynthesis occurred in non warm-injured kidneys. Warm anoxia can also occur during reimplantation of the kidney after storage. Lannon showed, by measurements of succinate metabolism, how the kidney was more sensitive to a period of warm hypoxia occurring after storage than to the same period of warm hypoxia occurring immediately prior to storage. =Lack of essential nutrients= Active metabolism of glucose with production of bicarbonate has been demonstrated by Pettersson and Cohen. Pettersson studies were on the metabolism of glucose and fatty acids by kidneys during 6 day hypothermic perfusion storage and he found that the kidneys consumed glucose at 4.4 Œºmol/g/day and fatty acids at 5.8 Œºmol/g/day. In Cohen's study the best 8 day stored kidneys consumed glucose at the rate of 2.3 Œºmol/g/day and 4.9 Œºmol/g/day respectively which made it likely that they were using fatty acids at similar rates to Pettersson's dogs' kidneys. The constancy of both the glucose consumption rate and the rate of bicarbonate production implied that no injury was affecting the glycolytic enzyme or carbonic anhydrase enzyme systems. Lee showed that fatty acids were the preferred substrate of the rabbit's kidney cortex at normothermic temperatures, and glucose the preferred substrate for the medullary cells which normally metabolise anaerobically. Abodeely showed that both fatty acids and glucose could be utilised by the outer medulla of the rabbit's kidney but that glucose was used preferentially. At hypothermia the metabolic needs of the kidney are much reduced but measurable consumption of glucose, fatty acids and ketone bodies occurs. Horsburgh showed that lipid is utilised by hypothermic kidneys, with palmitate consumption being 0-15% of normal in the rat kidney cortex at 15 ¬∞C. Pettersson showed that, on a molar basis, glucose and fatty acids were metabolised by hypothermically perfused kidneys at about the same rates. The cortex of the hypothermic dog kidney was shown by Huang to lose lipid (35% loss of total lipid after 24 hours) unless oleate was added to the kidney perfusate. Huang commented that this loss could affect the structure of the cell and that the loss also suggested that the kidney was utilising fatty acid. In a later publication Huang showed that dog kidney cortex slices metabolised fatty acids, but not glucose, at 10 ¬∞C. Even if the correct nutrients are provided, they may be lost by absorption into the tubing of the preservation system. Lee demonstrated that silicone rubber (a material used extensively in kidney preservation systems) absorbed 46% of a perfusate's oleic acid after 4 hours of perfusion. =Toxin accumulation= Abouna showed that ammonia was released into the perfusate during 3 day kidney storage, and suggested that this might be toxic to the kidney cells unless removed by frequent replacement of the perfusate. Some support for the use of perfusate exchange during long perfusions was provided by Liu who used perfusate exchange in his successful 7 day storage experiments. Grundmann also found that 96-hour preservation quality was improved by the use of a double volume of perfusate or by perfusate exchange. However, Grundmann's conclusions were based on comparisons with a control group of only 3 dogs. Cohen was unable to demonstrate any production of ammonia during 8 days of perfusion and no benefit from perfusate exchange; the progressive alkalinity that occurred during perfusion was shown to be due to bicarbonate production. =Toxic damage from the perfusate= Certain perfusates have been shown to have toxic effects on kidneys as a result of the inadvertent inclusion of particular chemicals in their formulation. Collins showed that the procaine included in the formulation of his flush fluids could be toxic, and Pegg has commented how toxic materials, such as PVC plasticizers, may be washed out of perfusion circuit tubing. Dvorak showed that the methyl-prednisolone addition to the perfusate that was thought to be essential by Woods might in some circumstances be harmful. He showed that with over 2 g of methyl-prednisolone in 650 ml of perfusate (compared with 250 mg in 1 litre used by Woods) irreversible haemodynamic and structural changes were produced in the kidney after 20 hours of perfusion. There was necrosis of capillary loops, occlusion of Bowman's spaces, basement membrane thickening and endothelial cell damage. =Washout of essential substrates= The level of nucleotides remaining in the cell after storage was thought by Warnick to be important in determining whether the cell would be able to re-synthesize ATP and recover after rewarming. Frequent changing of the perfusate or the use of a large volume of perfusate has the theoretical disadvantage that broken down adenine nucleotides may be washed out of the cells and so not be available for re- synthesis into ATP when the kidney is rewarmed. Injury to nuclear DNA Nuclear DNA is injured during cold storage of kidneys. Lazarus showed that single stranded DNA breaks occurred within 16 hours in hypothermically stored mice kidneys, with the injury being inhibited a little by storage in Collins' or Sacks' solutions. This nuclear injury differed from that seen in warm injury when double stranded DNA breaks occurred. Mechanical injury to the vascular system Perfusion storage methods can mechanically injury the vascular endothelium of the kidney, which leads to arterial thrombosis or fibrin deposition after reimplantation. Hill noted that, in human kidneys, fibrin deposition in the glomerulus after reimplantation and postoperative function, correlated with the length of perfusion storage. He had taken biopsies at revascularisation from human kidneys preserved by perfusion or ice storage, and showed by electron microscopy that endothelial disruption only occurred in those kidneys that had been perfused. Biopsies taken one hour after revascularisation showed platelets and fibrin adherent to any areas of denuded vascular basement membrane. A different type of vascular damage was described by Sheil who showed how a jet lesion could be produced distal to the cannula tied into the renal artery, leading to arterial thrombosis approximately 1 cm distal to the cannula site. Post reimplantation injury There is evidence that immunological mechanisms may injure hypothermically perfused kidneys after reimplantation if the perfusate contained specific antibody. Cross described two pairs of human cadaver kidneys that were perfused simultaneously with cryoprecipitated plasma containing type specific HLA antibody to one of the pairs. Both these kidneys suffered early arterial thrombosis. Light described similar hyperacute rejection following perfusion storage and showed that the cryoprecipitated plasma used contained cytotoxic IgM antibody. This potential danger of using cryoprecipitated plasma was demonstrated experimentally by Filo who perfused dog kidneys for 24 hours with specifically sensitised cryoprecipitated dog plasma and found that he could induce glomerular and vascular lesions with capillary engorgement, endothelial swelling, infiltration by polymorphonuclear leucocytes and arterial thrombosis. Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrated specific binding of IgG along endothelial surfaces, in glomeruli, and also in vessels. After reimplantation, complement fixation and tissue damage occurred in a similar pattern. There was some correlation between the severity of the histological damage and subsequent function of the kidneys. Many workers have attempted to prevent kidneys rewarming during reimplantation but only Cohen has described using a system of active cooling. Measurements of lysosomal enzyme release from kidneys subjected to sham anastomoses, when either in or out of the cooling system, demonstrated how sensitive kidneys were to rewarming after a period of cold storage, and confirmed the effectiveness of the cooling system in preventing enzyme release. A further factor in minimising injury at the reimplantation operations may have been that the kidneys were kept at 7 ¬∞C within the cooling coil, which was within a degree of the temperature used during perfusion storage, so that the kidneys were not subjected to the greater changes in temperature that would have occurred if ice cooling had been used. Dempster described using slow release of the vascular clamps at the end of kidney reimplantation operations to avoid injuring the kidney, but other workers have not mentioned whether or not they used this manoeuvre. After Cohen found vascular injury with intra renal bleeding after 3 days of perfusion storage, a technique of slow revascularisation was used for all subsequent experiments, with the aim of giving the intra- renal vessels time to recover their tone sufficiently to prevent full systolic pressure being applied to the fragile glomerular vessels. The absence of gross vascular injury in his later perfusions may be attributable to the use of this manoeuvre.

Otis Mason gave a portion of the property in 1872 to establish the Woodlawn Baptist Church, and preached there for the first four years, until a minister was appointed.History of Woodlawn Baptist Church He graduated from Columbian University in 1861, then worked there for 23 years, as principal of the college's preparatory school (1861‚Äì84). He first became affiliated with the United States National Museum in 1872, working as a collaborator in ethnology. This in 1884 turned into a full-time position as curator. The Smithsonian had recently built its first purpose-built museum building, the U.S. National Museum building (or Arts and Industries Building). Mason worked closely with George Brown Goode in the installation and reorganization of the museum collections that came with the move into that new building. In 1879 he was one of the founders of the Anthropological Society of Washington, and authored its constitution.Walter Hough, \\"Otis Tufton Mason,\\" American Anthropologist, 10:660-67, 1908. In 1890 Mason was appointed by President Benjamin Harrison to the newly created Board on Geographic Names in Executive Order No. 28, representing the Smithsonian Institution. In 1893 he with Ward Putman, head of Harvard‚Äôs Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, and Sol Bloom oversaw the cultural and anthropological display of the Midway Plaisance at the World's Columbian Exposition. As part of his curation work at the Smithsonian, Mason developed the culture area concept. Mason was anthropological editor of the American Naturalist and of the Standard Dictionary. He believed in Gustav Klemm's step-wise evolution of cultures and that technology was a marker of a culture's stage of development.

The system contains 38 branch locations and circulates over 10.5 million items annually. The system includes the Main Library in Fort Lauderdale, five regional libraries, and various branches. History From 1963 to 1972, activists established a library subcommittee to improve library service in Broward County. The report generated by the committee received wide media attention and was supported by County Commissioner Robert Hubener. On January 9, 1973, the Broward County Commission approved the establishment of a library system. The system began issuing borrower cards on June 17, 1974, for 270,000 items. There were four branches: Fort Lauderdale, Riverland, Mizell, and Hollywood. During the first year, more libraries joined the system; also, that year, the Friends of the Broward County Library were formed. Over the following three decades, many of the municipalities in Broward County elected to join the library system. These included Lauderhill, Hallandale, Dania Beach, Margate, Sunrise, Deerfield Beach, North Lauderdale, and Pompano Beach. Starting in 1978, library director Cecil Beach oversaw the planning and construction of the system's flagship branch, the Main Library. In 1980, the construction of the Main Library was funded. The cost of the Main Library went up from $20.5 to $42 million, in part because of inflation. Library-system director Cecil Beach was involved in all phases of the Main Library project, from planning to completion. In 1984, the Main Library opened. In 1982, the Broward Public Library Foundation was established as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization supporting the library system. In 1983, the South Regional Library located on the South Campus of Broward Community College became the first joint-use public-college library in the State of Florida. The library system was named \\"Library of the Year\\" in 1996 by Library Journal and Gale Research. At that time, the library held more than three million items, and had over 10 million visitors a year. Ongoing construction, including that funded by a 1999 bond issue, has resulted in the current total of 38 branch libraries in addition to the eight-story Main Library in downtown Fort Lauderdale. The Main Library also houses the Florida Center for the Book, the Bienes Museum of the Modern Book, and a public fine- arts exhibition center. Kelvin Watson was appointed as library-system director in 2017. African-American Research Library and Cultural Center On October 26, 2002, the Broward County Library opened the African-American Research Library and Cultural Center, located at 2650 Sistrunk Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The 60,000-square-foot facility has a 300-seat auditorium, 5,000-square-foot art gallery, and Small Business Resource Center. Since its opening, the Center has hosted more than 38 major exhibits and served more than 895,000 customers.

In 1977, he was appointed coach for his former club of Kalmar FF, a job he held for two years before switching to local rivals √ñster IF. He would remain there for three years, leading √ñsters IF to back-to-back Swedish Allsvenskan championships in 1980 and 1981. Bo Johansson went on to coach Norwegian club FK Jerv, Greek club Panionios NFC, and started an international career coaching the Iceland national team. He would have to wait 13 years for his next title, until 1994 when he led Danish team Silkeborg IF to the national Danish Superliga championship. In 1996, he was appointed Danish national team coach, taking over from Richard M√∏ller Nielsen who had managed the Danish team to the 1992 European Championship (Euro 1992) title, but had subsequently suffered lacklustre results. Bo Johansson presented a more offensive way of playing and he was successful in revitalising the Danish team, leading it to the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, which was to become one of the heights in Danish football. Despite a loss in the group stage to later tournament winners France, Denmark managed to go through to the final 16 where they put an attractive style of football on display, beating Nigeria 4-1 before losing out 2-3 in the quarter-final to the later silver medalists from Brazil. \\"Bosse\\" couldn't live up to the result and play at the 1998 World Cup two years later at the Euro 2000 in the Netherlands and Belgium.

The Bardoli Satyagraha of June 1928, in the state of Gujarat, India during the period of the British Raj, was a major episode of civil disobedience and revolt in the Indian Independence Movement. The movement was eventually led by Vallabhbhai Patel, and its success gave rise to Patel becoming one of the main leaders of the independence movement. The crisis In 1925, the taluka of Bardoli in Gujarat did not suffer financial troubles. However, the government of the Bombay Presidency had raised the tax rate by 22-30% that year, and despite petitions from civic groups, refused to cancel the rise in the face of the calamities. The situation for the farmers was grave enough that they barely had enough property and crops to pay off the tax, let alone for feeding themselves afterwards. =Considering the options= The Gujarati activists Narhari Parikh, Ravi Shankar Vyas, and Mohanlal Pandya talked to village chieftains and farmers, and solicited the help of Gujarat's most prominent freedom fighter, Vallabhbhai Patel. Patel had previously guided Gujarat's farmers during the Kheda struggle, and had served recently as Ahmedabad's municipal president. He was widely respected by common Gujaratis across the state. Patel told a delegation of farmers frankly that if they should realize fully what a revolt would imply. He would not lead them unless he had the unanimous understanding and agreement of all the villages involved. Refusing payment of taxes could lead to their property being confiscated, including their lands, and many would go to jail. They could face complete decimation. The villagers replied that they were prepared for the worst, but definitely could not accept the government's injustice. Patel then asked Gandhi to consider the matter. But Gandhi merely asked what Patel thought, and when the latter replied with confidence about the prospects, he gave his blessing. But Gandhi and Patel agreed that neither the Congress nor Gandhi would directly involve themselves, and the struggle left entirely to the people of Bardoli taluka. The struggle done Patel first wrote to the Governor of Bombay, asking him to reduce the taxes for the year in face of the calamities. But the Governor ignored the letter, and reciprocated by announcing the date of collection. Patel then instructed all the farmers of Bardoli taluka to refuse payment of their taxes. Aided by Parikh, Vyas and Pandya, he divided Bardoli into several zones - each with a leader and volunteers specifically assigned. Patel also placed some activists close to the government, to act as informers on the movements of government officials. Above all, Patel instructed the farmers to remain completely non-violent, and not respond physically to any incitements or aggressive actions from officials. He reassured them that the struggle would not end until not only the cancellation of all taxes for the year, but also when all the seized property and lands were returned to their rightful owners. The farmers received complete support from their compatriots in Gujarat. Many hid their most precious belongings with relatives in other parts, and the protestors received financial support and essential supplies from supporters in other parts. But Patel refused permission to enthusiastic supporters in Gujarat and other parts of India from going on sympathetic protest. The Government declared that it would crush the revolt. Along with tax inspectors, bands of Pathans were gathered from northwest India to forcibly seize the property of the villagers and terrorize them. The Pathans and the men of the collectors forced themselves into the houses and took all property, including cattle (resisters had begun keeping their cattle inside their locked homes when the collectors were about, in order to prevent them from seizing the animals from the fields). The government began to auction the houses and the lands. But not a single man from Gujarat or anywhere else in India came forward to buy them. Patel had appointed volunteers in every village to keep watch. As soon as he sighted the officials who were coming to auction the property, the volunteer would sound his bugle. The farmers would leave the village and hide in the jungles. The officials would find the entire village empty. They could never find out who owned a particular house. However, some rich people from Bombay came to buy some lands. There was also one village recorded that paid the tax. A complete social boycott was organized against them, wherein relatives broke their ties to families in the village. Other ways social boycott was enforced against landowners who broke with the tax strike or purchased seized land were to refuse to rent their fields or to work as laborers for them. Members of the legislative councils of Bombay and across India were angered by the terrible treatment of the protesting farmers. Indian members resigned their offices, and expressed open support of the farmers. The Government was heavily criticized, even by many in the Raj's offices. Resolution In 1928, an agreement was finally brokered by a Parsi member of the Bombay government. The Government agreed to restore the confiscated lands and properties, as well as cancel revenue payment not only for the year, but cancel the 30% raise until after the succeeding year. The government had appointed Maxwell-Broomfield Comission to look in to the matter. After a rigorous survey, the raise in taxes was decided to be just 6.03%. But the basic problems of the peasants were left unsolved and bonded labour continued. The farmers celebrated their victory, but Patel continued to work to ensure that all lands and properties were returned to every farmer, and that no one was left out. When the Government refused to ask the people who had bought some of the lands to return them, wealthy sympathizers from Bombay bought them out, and returned the lands to the rightful owners. Commemoration The momentum from the Bardoli victory aided in the resurrection of the freedom struggle nationwide. In 1930, the Congress would declare Indian independence, and the Salt Satyagraha would be launched by Gandhi. While Patel credited Gandhi's teachings and the farmers' undying resolve, people across the nation recognized his vital leadership. It was women of bardoli who bestowed the title Sardar for the first time, which in Gujarati and most Indian languages means Chief or Leader. It was after Bardoli that Sardar Patel became one of India's most important leaders.

Seahorse Key was the site a watchtower erected in 1801 by followers of William Augustus Bowles, self-designated Director General of the State of Muskogee, an attempt to set up an independent state in the western part of East Florida. The watchtower was destroyed by a Spanish naval force in 1802. Seahorse Key was used as a detention center for Seminoles captured in the Second Seminole War (1835‚Äì1842) before transfer to the West. At that time the Federal government reserved several of the islands in the Cedar Keys archipelago for military use. Cedar Key became an important port during the 1840s, and in 1850 Congress appropriated funding for a lighthouse on Seahorse Key. Lieutenant George Meade helped design the lighthouse. The lighthouse was completed and lit in 1854. At the beginning of the American Civil War Confederate sympathizers extinguished the light. Federal troops occupied Seahorse Key in 1862, and used it as a prison for the duration of the war. The lighthouse was put back into service after the war ended. The lighthouse building was tripled in size in 1905 when a U.S. Navy wireless station was established there. The light was taken out of commission in 1915. Seahorse Key, including the lighthouse, became part of the Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge, established in 1929. The University of Florida has leased of the wildlife refuge, including the lighthouse, for use as a marine laboratory since 1952. The lighthouse is used as a dormitory for students.

It is part of the Chhagaam Gol (\\"Circle of Six Villages\\"). Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, one of India's greatest leaders in the Indian Independence Movement grew up in Karamsad. It was also the home of his elder brother Vithalbhai Patel, who was also an important political leader. The Patel brothers lived with their two elder brothers and one younger brother and sister, and parents Jhaverbhai and Ladba Patel in a mud-brick house adjacent to his family's farm holdings. This house is preserved to date as a memorial to Patel.  History  The date of establishment of Karamsad is not exactly known, but during the era of Kumarpal i.e., in 1155 AD, the village consisted mainly of people from Koli tribes. This community mostly rely on agricultural skills. In 1211, Aja Patel, originally from Hilod (a town near Adalaj), came over and settled here. Because of his skills, agricultural production increased and the village prospered. The details henceforth from Aja Patel to Kupa Patel are not available, however Kupa Patel was from the twelfth or fourteenth generation of Aja Patel. Kupa Patel was an ardent devotee of Lord Shiva. He renovated Lord Shiva's temple, which was in ruins and situated in the western side of the village. That was well built by his son Lakha Patel. He had also helped build a lake in the village. Devidas, a few generations down had two sons. Jibhai and Bajibhai. His sons asked the Moghul Governor of Ahmedabad Province to let them keep Karamsad for revenue collection. Of them, Majibhai's four sons and their descendants distributed themselves in six different Khadkis (street or lane before a group of two or more houses with a common gate) in Karamsad. Sardar Patel Memorial at Karamsad Six different Khadkis were formed in Karamsad after the six descendants of Mahijibhai. # Bhayni Khadki (Gokaldas) # Bapani Khadki (Govendas) # Hathibhaini Khadki (Sunderdas) # Motabhaini Khadki (Jivabhai) # Jini Khadki (Bhavijibhai) # Chhatthi Khadki (Laljibhai) Another popular story goes like this - the original owner of the village was a Rajput. Mahijibhai Patel of the Uvarsad village, near Ahmedabad came and settled here. The Rajput community of the village did not like the arrival of Mahijibhai. They killed two of his six sons. Both of his brothers had actually gone to the Petlad court, where a case was filed against the Rajput community by Mahijibhai's sons. On their way back, they were killed by the Rajputs near Sandesar, where afterwards memorial pillars were built in their name. Today there are hardly any Rajputs in Karamsad. After the Patidars occupied most of the land in Karamsad, the Rajputs left and settled in Napa village. The original Patidars of Karamsad were physically very strong. They were known for their endurance and their ability to bear torture. One of Mahijibhai's sons suffered from a carbuncle. (A carbuncle is when a particular part of the body becomes gangrenous). During that time, antibiotics were not available, so the only way to treat it was to cauterize that part. The local method at that time was by heating an iron rod and applying it over the affected part instantly. During this, the person would lose all his calm and nerves. At that time, this procedure would involve 3-4 people tightly holding the patient. One of the Rajput in Napa village was known to do this procedure. However that son was brave, so when Mahjibhai's son was taken over there he said, \\"Nobody should hold me. I do not need any support. Nothing is going to happen to me.\\" The Rajput performing this procedure had kept the old rivalry between them in mind. So he overheated the iron rod and put it over the affected part with great vengeance. Mahijibhai's son bore it without uttering a single word. When the Rajput praised him for his enduring power, Mahijibhai's son said, \\"Do not praise me. I am nothing in comparison to my other brothers. Their endurance power is a lot greater than mine.\\" After this incident, the Rajput community in Napa village came to know about the strength of the Patidar community and they stopped creating trouble in and around Karamsad. When Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was staying at Nadiad, which was his maternal native, he had suffered from Bubo (an inflammatory swelling of a lymph gland) of the armpit. He had it cauterized without uttering a single word. After all he was also from Karamsad. During the making of Vallabh Vidyanagar, had the Patidars of Karamsad not donated generously, then Vidyanagar would not have looked like what it looks today. Karamsad has been quite under the influence of Swaminarayan Sect and Santram Temple for a long time. Both these sects do a lot of activities in Karamsad. Karamsad has always remained way ahead, be it in politics, education, religion, cooperative activities or industries in the Kheda District. The Patidars of Karamsad are well known in the social community of Chha Gam (six villages). The yesterday's generation of Patidars have proved best themselves in different fields in Africa, Fiji, Myanmar (Burma), etc. the first two Patidars to reach East Africa in 1895 AD. were Maganbhai Naranbhai and Ishwarbhai Nathabhai Patel. Today the Patidars of Karamsad are spread out in England, Canada, America and Australia. Santram Temple in Karamsad is famous for its Convention Hall / Banquet Hall. The temple also provides health services to the people at a very nominal charge. It also runs coaching classes for students. After being coached in these classes many students have been accepted into various engineering and medical colleges. A temple of Goddess Khodiyar ‚Äì the presiding deity of Patidars has been recently built. It is also has various facilities and a big banquet hall, which can be used for marriage ceremonies. There are very few Digambar Jain Temples in the whole of Gujarat, but still there is a temple (Derasar) in Karamsad. Moreover, there are a Swaminarayan Temple, Bapeshwar Mahadev, Catholic mission, and a mosque. Karamsad is situated at 22 North latitude and 72 East longitude. It has a population of 14,000 people and has water works also, but in the past, people used to get water from Kharo Kuvo, Lakhvo Kuvo, Rabari No Kuvo, Moto Kuvo and other wells. Sardar Patel Biography Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sardar Patel belonged to a Gurjar family of Gujarat. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was popularly known as Iron Man of India. His full name was Vallabhbhai Patel. He played a leading role in the Indian freedom struggle and became the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India. He is credited with achieving political integration of India. Patel was born on 31 October 1875 in Nadiad, a City in Gujarat. His father Jhaverbhai was a farmer and mother Laad Bai was a simple lady. Sardar Vallabhbhai's early education took place in Karamsad. Then he joined a school in Petlad. After two years he joined a high school in Nadiad. He passed his high school examination in 1896. Vallabhbhai wanted to become a barrister. To realize this ambition he had to go to England. But he did not have the financial means to even join a college in India. In those days a candidate could study in private and sit for an examination in Law. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel borrowed books from a lawyer of his acquaintance and studied at home. Occasionally he attended courts of law and listened attentively to the arguments of lawyer. Vallabhbhai passed the Law examination. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel started his Law practice in Godhra. Soon his practice flourished. He married Jhaberaba. In 1904, he had a baby daughter Maniben Patel, and in 1905 his son Dahyabhai was born. Vallabhbhai sent his elder brother Vitthalbhai, who himself was a lawyer, to England for higher studies in Law. Patel was only thirty-three years old when his wife died. He did not wish to marry again. After his brother's return, Vallabhbhai went to England. He studied with single-minded devotion and stood first in the Barrister-at-Law Examination. Sardar Patel returned to India in 1913 and started his practice in Ahmedabad. Soon he became popular. At the urging of his friends, Patel contested and won elections to become the sanitation commissioner of Ahmedabad in 1917. Sardar Patel was deeply impressed by Gandhiji's success in Champaran Satyagraha. In 1918, there was a drought in the Kheda division of Gujarat. Peasants asked for relief from the high rate of taxes but the British government refused. Gandhiji took up peasants cause but could not devote his full-time in Kheda. He was looking for someone who could lead the struggle in his absence. At this point Sardar Patel volunteered to come forward and lead the struggle. He gave up his lucrative legal practice and entered public life. Vallabhbhai successfully led peasants revolt in Kheda and the revolt ended in 1919 when the British government agreed to suspend collection of revenue and roll back the rates. Kheda Satyagraha turned Vallabhbhai Patel into a national hero. Vallabhbhai supported Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement, and as president of the Gujarat Congress, helped in organizing bonfires of British goods in Ahmedabad. He gave up his English clothes and started wearing Khadi. Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel was elected Ahmedabad's municipal president in 1922, 1924 and 1927. During his terms, Ahmedabad was extended a major supply of electricity and underwent major education reforms. Drainage and sanitation systems were extended over all the city. In 1928, Bardoli Taluka in Gujarat suffered from famine. In this hour of distress the British government raised the revenue taxes by thirty percent. Sardar Patel took up cudgels on behalf of the farmers and appealed to the Governor to reduce the taxes. The Governor refused and the government even announced the date of the collection of the taxes. Sardar Patel organized the farmers and told them not to pay even a single pie of tax. The government tried to repress the revolt but ultimately bowed before Vallabhbhai Patel. It was during the struggle and after the victory in Bardoli that caused intense excitement across India, that Patel was increasingly addressed by his colleagues and followers as Sardar. Sardar Patel was imprisoned during Civil Disobedience Movement in 1930. After the signing of Gandhi-Irwin pact in 1931, Sardar Patel was released and he was elected Congress president for its 1931 session in Karachi. Upon the failure of the Round Table Conference in London, Gandhiji and Sardar Patel were arrested in January 1932 and imprisoned in the Yerwada Central Jail. During this term of imprisonment, Sardar Patel and Mahatma Gandhi grew close to one another, and the two developed a close bond of affection, trust, and frankness without reserve. Sardar Patel was finally released in July 1934. In August 1942, the Congress launched the Quit India Movement. The government jailed all the important leaders of the Congress, including Vallabhbhai Patel. All the leaders were released after three years. After achieving independence on 15 August 1947, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru became the first Prime Minister of independent India and Sardar Patel became the Deputy Prime Minister. He was in charge of Home Affairs, Information and Broadcasting and the Ministry of States. There were 565 princely states in India at that time. Some of the Maharajas and Nawabs were dreaming of becoming independent rulers once the British quit India. They argued that the government of free India should treat them as equals. Some of them went to the extent of planning to send their representatives to the United Nations Organization. Patel invoked the patriotism of India's monarchs, asking them to join in the freedom of their nation and act as responsible rulers who cared about the future of their people. He persuaded the princes of 565 states of the impossibility of independence from the Indian republic, especially in the presence of growing opposition from their subjects. With political foresight, he consolidated the small kingdoms. The entire nation was with him. He tackled the Nizam of Hyderabad and the Nawab of Junagarh who initially did not want to join India. Sardar Patel's efforts brought success, uniting a scattered nation without much bloodshed. He was nicknamed 'Iron Man' . Sardar Patel died of cardiac arrest on 15 December 1950. For his services to the nation Sardar Patel was conferred with Bharat Ratna posthumously in 1991.

Plot John Herschel observes Comet Halley from his observatory in Cape Town in 1835 (illustration from the book). The story starts with a comet called Gallia, that touches the Earth in its flight and collects a few small chunks of it. The disaster occurs on January 1 of the year 188x in the area around Gibraltar. On the territory that is carried away by the comet there remain a total of thirty-six people of French, English, Spanish and Russian nationality. These people do not realize at first what has happened, and consider the collision an earthquake. They first notice weight loss: Captain Servadac's adjutant Ben Zoof, to his amazement, jumps twelve meters high. Zoof with Servadac also soon notice that the alternation of day and night is shortened to six hours, that east and west have changed sides, and that water begins to boil at 66 degrees Celsius, from which they rightly deduce that the atmosphere became thinner and pressure dropped. At the beginning of their stay in Gallia they notice the Earth with the Moon, but think it is an unknown planet. Other important information is obtained through their research expedition with a ship, which the comet also took. During the voyage they discover a mountain chain blocking the sea, which they initially consider to be the Mediterranean Sea and then they find the island of Formentera (before the catastrophe a part of the Balearic Islands), where they find French astronomer Palmyrin Rosette, who helps them to solve all the mysterious phenomena. They are all on a comet which Rosette discovered by a year ago and predicted to be on a collision course with Earth, but no one believed the astronomer, because a layer of thick fog at the time prevented astronomical observations in other places. A new research expedition determines the circumference of Gallia to be 2320 km. The mass of the comet is calculated by Rosette. He determines it at 209,346 billion tonnes. For the calculation he uses spring scales and forty 5-franc silver coins, the weight of which on earth equaled exactly one kilogram. However, the owner of the scales, Isaac Hakkabut, has rigged the instrument, so the results have to be cut by a quarter. The involuntary travelers through the Solar system do not have any hope for long-term colonization of their new world, because it is lacking arable land. They feed themselves mainly with the animals that were left on the chunk carried away by Gallia. One strange phenomenon they meet is that the sea on the comet does not freeze, even though the temperature drops below the freezing point (believed to be due to the theory that a stagnant water surface resists freezing longer than when rippled by wind). Once a stone is thrown into the sea, the sea freezes in a few moments. The ice is completely smooth and allows skating and sleigh sailing. Despite the dire situation in which the castaways find themselves, old power disputes from Earth continue on Gallia, because the French and English officers consider themselves the representatives of their respective governments. The object of their interest is for example previously Spanish Ceuta, which has become an island on the comet and which both parties start to consider an unclaimed territory. Captain Servadac therefore attempts to occupy Ceuta, without success. It turns out that the island has been occupied by Englishmen, who maintain a connection to their base at Gibraltar through an optical telegraph. Gallia gets to an extreme point of its orbit and begins its return to Earth. In early November Rossete's refined calculations show that there will be a new collision with the Earth, exactly two years after the first, again on January 1. Therefore, the idea is conceived of leaving the comet at collision time in a balloon. The proposal is approved and the castaways make a balloon out of the sails of their ship. In mid-December there is an earthquake, in which Gallia partially falls apart and loses a fragment, which probably kills all Englishmen in Ceuta and Gibraltar. When on January 1 there is again a contact between the atmospheres of Gallia and Earth, the space castaways leave in the balloon and land safely two kilometers from Mostaganem in Algeria. Main characters The 36 inhabitants of Gallia include a German Jew, an Italian, three Frenchmen, eight Russians, 10 Spaniards, and 13 British soldiers. The main characters are: *Captain Hector Servadac of the French Algerian army *Laurent Ben Zoof, Servadac's aide *Count Wassili Timascheff of Russia *Lt. Procope, the commander of Timascheff's yacht, Dobrina *Isaac Hakkabut, a stereotyped Jewish trader *Nina, a cheerful young Italian goatherd (girl). *Pablo, a Spanish boy *Colonel Heneage Finch Murphy and Major Sir John Temple Oliphant of Britain's Gibraltar garrison. In the French original Murphy is actually a Brigadier (General), a rank too high to be the butt of Verne's joking description as playing an interminable game of chess without a pawn being taken. The translator accordingly demoted him to the rank of Colonel, a rank less likely to cause offense. *Palmyrin Rosette, a French astronomer and discoverer of the comet and previously Servadac's teacher. Publication history The book was first published in France (Hetzel Edition, 1877). The English translation by Ellen E. Frewer, was published in England by Sampson Low (November 1877), and the U.S. by Scribner Armstrong with the title Hector Servadac; Or the Career of a Comet. The Frewer translation alters the text considerably with additions and emendations, paraphrases dialogue, and rearranges material, although the general thread of the story is followed. The translation was made from the serial version of the novel, published January to December 1877 (see below, Antisemitism). At the same time George Munro in New York published an anonymous translation in a newspaper format as #43 of his Seaside Library books. This is the only literal translation containing all the dialogue and scientific discussions. Unfortunately the translation stops after Part II Chapter 10, and continues with the Frewer translation. The same year a still different translation by Edward Roth was published in Philadelphia by Claxton, Remsen, and Heffelfinger in two parts. Part I (October 1877) was entitled To the Sun and Part II (May 1878) Off on a Comet. This was reprinted in 1895 by David McKay. Occasional reprints of these books were published around 1900 by Norman L. Munro, F.M. Lupton, Street&Smith;, Hurst and Co., and Federal Book Co. In 1911, Vincent Parke and Company published a shortened version of the Frewer translation, omitting Part II, Chapter 3. Parke used the title Off on a Comet, and since that time the book has usually been referred to with that title instead of the correct one, Hector Servadac. In 1926, the first two issues of Amazing Stories carried Off on a Comet in two parts. and In 1959, Classics Illustrated released Off on a Comet as a graphic novel (issue #149). In 1960 Dover (New York) re-published the Roth translations, unabridged, as Space Novels by Jules Verne, including reproductions of the original engravings from the first French editions. In 1965 the I. O. Evans condensation of the Frewer translation was published in two volumes as Anomalous Phenomena and Homeward Bound by ARCO, UK and Associated Booksellers, US. University Press of the Pacific, Honolulu, re-published the Frewer translation in 2000. In September 2007, Solaris Books (U.K.) published Off on a Comet as an appendix to Splinter by Adam Roberts, as a slightly edited version of the Parke edition. In a 2007 blog post on The Guardian, Adam Roberts reviewed one 1877 translation. Roberts felt that the translation was inaccurate and incomplete.Roberts, Adam (2007-09-11). \\"Jules Verne deserves a better translation service\\". The Guardian. Roberts' criticism is, however, somewhat vindicated by the fact that the version of Hector Servadac he was criticizing was the corrupt version of the original Frewer translation found on Project Gutenberg (based on the Parke edition, above), which was made from a different French original than the one he was using. In October 2007, Choptank Press published an on-line version of Munro's 1877 Hector Servadac, Travels and Adventures through the Solar System edited by Norman Wolcott, followed (December 2007) by Hector Servadac: The Missing Ten Chapters from the Munro Translation newly translated by Norman Wolcott and Christian S√°nchez. In 2008, the Choptank Press published a combined book version Hector Servadac: Travels and Adventures Through the Solar System containing: (I) An enlarged replica of Seaside Library edition #43 as published by George Munro, New York, 1877; (II)A typeset version of the same in large readable type; (III) A new translation of the last 10 chapters from the original French by Norman Wolcott and Christian Sanchez in the literal style of the remainder of the book; and (IV) 100 illustrations from the original publications enlarged to format. Antisemitism controversy From the beginning Verne had problems with this novel. Material in this section is described in the book by Originally he intended that Gallia would crash into the earth, killing all on board. This may have been the motivation for naming the hero \\"Servadac\\" with the mirror of the French word cadavres (\\"corpses\\"), predicting all would die on the \\"return\\". His publisher Hetzel would not accept this however, given the large juvenile readership in his monthly magazine, and Verne was forced to graft a rather unsatisfying ending onto the story, allowing the inhabitants of Gallia to escape the crash in a balloon. The first appearance in French was in the serial magazine ', commencing on 1 January 1877 and ending on 15 December 1877. It was in June 1877 when chapter 18 appeared with the introduction and description of Isac Hakhabut: This prompted the chief rabbi of Paris, Zadoc Kahn, to write a letter to Hetzel, objecting that this material had no place in a magazine for young people. Hetzel and Verne co-signed a reply indicating they had no intention of offending anyone, and promising to make corrections in the next edition. However Verne left the salvage work to Hetzel, asking Hetzel at the end of the summer, \\"Have you arranged the affair of the Jews in Servadac?\\" The principal change was to replace \\"Jew\\" with \\"Isac\\" throughout, and to add \\"Christian countries\\" to those where Hakhabut plied his trade. The anti-semitic tone remained however, sales were lower than for other Verne books, and the American reprint houses saw little profit with only a single printing by George Munro in a newspaper format. Even the Hetzel revised version has never been translated into English, as both Victorian translations were made from the magazine version. This has caused some modern reviewers to unfairly criticize the early translators, assuming that they had inserted the anti-semitic material which Verne actually wrote.

Among his best-known works are the 1457 Mainz Psalter, the 1462 Bible or Biblia pulcra, and the 1484 Herbarius latinus. Life and works Sch√∂ffer was born in Gernsheim. Working for Fust, Sch√∂ffer was the principal workman of Johannes Gutenberg, inventor of modern typography, whose 42-Line Bible was completed in 1455. In 1455 he testified for Johann Fust against Gutenberg. By 1457 he and Fust had formed the firm Fust and Sch√∂ffer, after the foreclosure of the mortgage on Gutenberg's printing workshop.Peter Schoeffer Printer of Mainz - web exhibition at Bridwell Library Famous works include the Psalter of 1457, the 1462 Bible (the fourth printed Bible, also known as the Biblia pulcra [beautiful Bible])The First Explicitly Dated Bible, with the First Printer's Mark (August 1462) Jeremy Norman's History of Information.com Cicero's De officiis (1465), and Herbarius - Rogatu plurimorum... (1484), usually referred to as the \\"Herbarius latinus\\". The Herbarius was compiled from older sources and was popular enough to go through ten reprints before 1499. It illustrates and describes 150 plants and 96 medicines commonly found in apothecaries. There is reason to believe that Sch√∂ffer himself commissioned the compilation, although the name of the compiler is not recorded. Sch√∂ffer is considered the author of many innovations such as dating books, introducing the printer's device and Greek characters in print, developing the basics of punchcutting and type-founding, and using colored inks in print. After going into business on his own, Sch√∂ffer confined his publishing to works on theology, and civil and ecclesiastical law. He died in Mainz. Sch√∂ffer married Fust's only daughter, Christina, and his sons also entered the printer's trade. His son John carried on as printer between 1503 and 1531, was competent, but did not rank with the top printers of that time. Another son, Peter the younger, was an able die-cutter and printer, and conducted business in Mainz (1509‚Äì23), Worms (1512‚Äì29), Strasbourg (1530‚Äì39) and Venice (1541‚Äì42). In 1526, Peter Sch√∂ffer the younger published the first English New Testament in Worms, translated by William Tyndale.Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh√°sz & Guido Latr√© (eds.), Tyndale‚Äôs Testament, Turnhout: Brepols, 2002, p. 148. Peter the younger's son Ivo, continued the printing business at Mainz (1531‚Äì55). Legacy Sch√∂fferhofer Hefeweizen Sch√∂fferhofer is a brand of German wheat beer named for the former house of Peter Sch√∂ffer (the house was called the Mainzer Sch√∂fferhof) in which a brewery was founded. This brand of beer sports a portrait of Peter Sch√∂ffer as its trademark. The Sch√∂fferhofer brand originates from this brewery in Mainz, which is also known as the Brauerei Dreik√∂nigshof.

MSF often has difficulties treating patients because the medicines required are too expensive or are no longer produced. Sometimes, the only drugs available are highly toxic or ineffective, and they often have to resort to inadequate testing methods to diagnose patients. The lack of research into diseases that affect most of the world‚Äôs poor population is known as the 10-90 gap and it occurs because pharmaceutical companies rarely make a profit when developing drugs for these diseases. Although some countries have created legislation to encourage development of essential but commercially ignored medicines, which are called orphan drugs in the United States, MSF started this campaign in November 1999 to bring more awareness to the issue, using its prize money from its 1999 Nobel Peace Prize to fund the project. MSF‚Äôs Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines is pushing to lower the prices of existing drugs, vaccines and diagnostic tests, to stimulate research and development into new treatments for diseases that primarily affect the poor, and to overcome other barriers that prevent patients getting the treatment they need. The Campaign is made up of a team of medical, legal, policy and communications specialists working together to tackle these various issues. Conditions The Campaign is calling for improvements to the quality of food aid to meet growing children‚Äôs nutritional needs. They are also urging a rapid scale-up in the use and production of Ready-to-Use Foods (RUF) to reduce childhood deaths from malnutrition. It is campaigning for new TB drugs and simple diagnostics to be developed while continuing to call to attention the serious underfunding for TB research. The Campaign continues to fight to ensure that patients have access to better and improved HIV treatments as well as further scaling up of treatment. The Campaign supports the use of flexibilities in world trade rules and the creation of a patent pool Patent pool, http://www.unitaid.eu/ to ensure that patents don‚Äôt get in the way of access to the medicines patients need. Research The Campaign is working to promote alternative ways of steering and funding medical research to meet the medical needs of people in developing countries, rather than market priorities. Policy MSF has supported policies that large drugmakers have resisted, in an effort to improve access to essential medicines. The director of policy advocacy Michelle Childs of MSF said \\"An important precedent, not just for the people living with HIV within its country, who have been campaigning for this, but also for other developing countries. As medicines for HIV and hepatitis B are increasingly under patent in developing counties, Indonesia has shown that countries can and should take action to enable the production of low-cost versions of essential life-saving medicines for their citizens\\" See also * Essential medicines ** WHO Model List of Essential Medicines * World Health Organization ** Department of Essential Drugs and Medicines * Universities Allied for Essential Medicines References External links *MSF Access Campaign website *Untangling the Web of ARV Price Reductions, MSF Access Campaign Resource Guide Category:Charities based in Switzerland Category:Health activism Category:Tuberculosis organizations Category:Malaria organizations Category:Pharmaceuticals policy ","title":"Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines"},{"id":"3626762","text":"Charles Harris Wesley (December 2, 1891 ‚Äì August 16, 1987) was an American historian, educator, minister, and author.

SIGCUM, also known as Converter M-228, was a rotor cipher machine used to encrypt teleprinter traffic by the United States Army. Hastily designed by William Friedman and Frank Rowlett, the system was put into service in January 1943 before any rigorous analysis of its security had taken place. SIGCUM was subsequently discovered to be insecure by Rowlett, and was immediately withdrawn from service. The machine was redesigned to improve its security, reintroduced into service by April 1943, and remained in use until the 1960s. Development In 1939, Friedman and Rowlett worked on the problem of creating a secure teleprinter encryption system. They decided against using a tape-based system, such as those proposed by Gilbert Vernam, and instead conceived of the idea of generating a stream of five-bit pulses by use of wired rotors. Because of lack of funds and interest, however, the proposal was not pursued any further at that time. This changed with the United States' entry into World War II in December 1941. Rowlett was assigned to develop a teleprinter encryption system for use between Army command centers in United Kingdom and Australia (and later in North Africa). Friedman described to Rowlett a concrete design for a teleprinter cipher machine that he had invented. However, Rowlett discovered some flaws in Friedman's proposed circuitry that showed the design to be flawed. Under pressure to report to a superior about the progress of the machine, Friedman responded angrily, accusing Rowlett of trying to destroy his reputation as a cryptanalyst. After Friedman calmed down, Rowlett proposed some designs for a replacement machine based on rotors. They settled on one, and agreed to write up a complete design and have it reviewed by another cryptanalyst by the following day. The design agreed upon was a special attachment for a standard teleprinter. The attachment used a stack of five 26-contact rotors, the same as those used in the SIGABA, the highly secure US off-line cipher machine. Each time a key character was needed, thirteen inputs to the rotor stack were energized at the input endplate. Passing through the rotor stack, these thirteen inputs were to be scrambled at the output endplate. However, only five live contacts would be used. These five outputs would form five binary impulses, which would form the keystream for the cipher, to be combined with the message itself, encoded in the 5-bit Baudot code. The rotors advanced odometrically; that is, after each encipherment, the \\"fast\\" rotor would advance one step. Once every revolution of the fast rotor, the \\"medium\\" rotor would step once. Similarly, ever revolution of the medium rotor, the \\"slow\\" rotor would step, and so on for the other two rotors. However, which rotor was assigned as the \\"fast\\", \\"medium\\", \\"slow\\" etc. rotors was controlled by a set of five multi-switches. This gave a total of 5! = 120 different rotor stepping patterns. The machine was equipped with a total of 10 rotors, each of which could be inserted \\"direct\\" or in reversed order, yielding 10 \\\\times 9 \\\\times 8 \\\\times 7 \\\\times 6 \\\\times 2^{5} = 967,680 possible rotor orderings and alignments. Introduction of the machine The design for this machine, which was designated the Converter M-228, or SIGCUM, was given to the Teletype Corporation, who were also producing SIGABA. Rowlett recommended that the adoption of the machine be postponed until after a study of its cryptographic security, but SIGCUM was urgently needed by the Army, and the machine was put into production. Rowlett then proposed that the machine used in the Pentagon code room be monitored by connecting a page-printing \\"spy machine\\". The output could be then studied to establish whether the machine was resistant to attack. Rowlett's suggestion was implemented at the same time the first M-228 machines were installed at the Pentagon in January 1943, used for the Washington-Algiers link. The machines worked as planned, and, initially, Rowlett's study of its security, joined by cryptanalyst Robert Ferner, uncovered no signs of cryptographic weakness. However, after a few days, a SIGCUM operator made a serious operating error, retransmitting the same message twice using the same machine settings, producing a depth. From this, Rowlett was able to deduce the underlying plaintext and keystream used by the machine. By 2 a.m., an analysis of the keystream allowed him to deduce the wiring of the fast and medium rotors, and of the output wiring. SIGCUM was immediately withdrawn from service, and work on a replacement system, SIGTOT -- a one-time tape machine designed by Leo Rosen -- was given top priority. Redesign Meanwhile, M-228 was redesigned to improve its security. Only five inputs, rather than thirteen, were energized. The five output contacts, instead of being used as the five output bits directly, were instead connected by three leads, each connected to different output point. That meant that an output bit could be energized by any of three different outputs from the rotor maze, making analysis of the machine more complex. The reduced number of inputs ensured that the generated key would not be biased. The rotor stepping was also made more complex. The slowest two rotors, which originally were unlikely to step during the course of an encipherment, were redesigned so that they stepped depending on the output of the previous key output. One rotor, designated the \\"fast bump\\" rotor, would step if the fourth and fifth bits of the previous output were both true; and similarly the \\"slow bump\\" rotor would do the same for the first, second and third bits. Certain of the rotor stepping arrangements were discovered to be weaker than others, and so these were ruled out for key lists. This redesigned version of the M-228 was put into service by April 1943. However, the machine was judged to be only secure enough to handle traffic up to SECRET by landline, and CONFIDENTIAL by radio. The machine was also shared with the United Kingdom for joint communications. A further-modified version of the M-228 that could be used for the highest level traffic, was designated M-228-M, or SIGHUAD. From that point on, the Army monitored the communications of its high-level systems to ensure that good operational procedure was being followed, even for highly secure devices such as the SIGABA and SIGTOT devices. As a result, poor operator practices, such as transmitting messages in depth, were largely eliminated. References * Stephen J.

Historical background  The Nachtst√ºcke (Night Pieces), Op. 23, were composed in 1839 together with Faschingsschwank aus Wien and published one year later. The Intermezzo from Faschingsschwank was originally published as a supplement to the Neue Zeitschrift and identified as a 'fragment from the Nachtst√ºcke which are to appear shortly'. Schumann envisaged the following titles for the four pieces: # Trauerzug (\\"Funeral procession\\") # Kuriose Gesellschaft (\\"Strange company\\") # N√§chtliches Gelage (\\"Nocturnal revelries\\") # Rundgesang mit Solostimmen (\\"Roundelay with solo voices\\") These titles were not included in the original edition. = Death of brother = Schumann wrote the Nachtst√ºcke under extremely stressful circumstances. He was spending the winter in Vienna. On March 30, 1839, he received a letter concerning the imminent death of his older brother Eduard (1799‚Äì1839), which could have meant economic disaster to the family's publishing business. In a letter to his fianc√©e Clara Wieck he wrote, \\"Wouldn‚Äôt you leave me if I were now to become a very poor man and told you to leave me because I would bring you nothing but sorrow?\\". Because he had premonitions of his brother's death, he wanted to call his new composition Corpse Fantasia. > \\"I always saw funeral processions, coffins, unhappy and despairing people. > [...] Often I was so distraught that tears flowed and I didn‚Äôt know why‚Äîthen > [Eduard's wife] Therese's letter arrived and I knew why\\". While working on his Corpse Fantasia Schumann always got stuck \\"at a place where it seemed as if someone was sobbing 'O God' from a heavy heart\\". Schumann left Vienna for Zwickau, Germany on April 5, 1839, one day before his brother would die there. (He actually missed the funeral.) He wrote to Clara: > \\"Half past three on Saturday morning, while traveling, I heard a chorale of > trombones‚Äîit was the moment Eduard died. [...] I still feel stunned by all > the exertion. [...] Without you I long ago would have been where he is now\\". Schumann eventually heeded the advice of Clara concerning the title of the work: \\"The public won‚Äôt understand what you mean and it will bother them. I think you should settle for the general title Nightpieces\\". = Schiller's Funeral Phantasy = 18th century poets apparently were less scrupulous. Friedrich von Schiller did write a Leichenphantasie which may have inspired Schumann. The opening fits the mood of Schumann's Funeral Procession: Mit erstorbnem Scheinen Steht der Mond auf todtenstillen Hainen, Seufzend streicht der Nachtgeist durch die Luft - Nebelwolken schauern, Sterne trauern Bleich herab, wie Lampen in der Gruft. Gleich Gespenstern, stumm und hohl und hager, Zieht in schwarzem Todtenpompe dort Ein Gewimmel nach dem Leichenlager Unterm Schauerflor der Grabnacht fort. [...] Lo! on high the moon, her lustre dead, O'er the death-like grove uplifts her head, Sighing flits the spectre through the gloom-- Misty clouds are shivering, Pallid stars are quivering, Looking down, like lamps within a tomb. Spirit-like, all silent, pale, and wan, Marshall'd in procession dark and sad, To the sepulchre a crowd moves on, In the grave-night's dismal emblems clad. [...] (Trans. Edgar A. Bowring. New York: Hurst & Company, 1872) = Romantic traits = There is no obvious programmatic relationship between Schumann's Night Pieces and E.T.A. Hoffmann‚Äôs narrations collected under the same title, but the fantastic, gloomy and macabre mood is similar.  The pieces  = Nachtst√ºck 1 = Funeral procession C Major The Trauerzug has the indication 'Mehr langsam, oft zur√ºckhaltend' ('More slow, often holding back' [the tempo]). The image of ghostly groping is evoked by the short eighth note chords in piano, the harmonic uncertainty‚Äîonly after eight bars do we reach a secure C major and last not least the rhythmic displacement of the strong beat. In the militaristically solemn funeral marches of Beethoven and Chopin, the dotted rhythm naturally emphasizes the downbeat. In Schumann we still have some rudiments of this militaristic march rhythm, but ironically it is placed on the 'wrong' beat emphasizing the fourth beat and creating a feeling of mocking hesitance. The characteristic repeated motif of descending seconds (b flat-a-g-f-e, f-e-d-c-b) followed by a modified ascending inversion (c-d-e-e-e), and with a dotted rhythmic figure at the third and fourth notes is clearly reminiscent of the characteristic ostinato phrase of the fourth movement of Hector Berlioz's Symphonie Fantastique, which is entitled \\"The procession to the stake\\" (\\"Marche au supplice\\") (see sections 50-52, bars 17ff). Schumann had written a critique of Berlioz's symphony in \\"Neue Zeitschrift f√ºr Musik \\" four years earlier, in 1835 , which was by far the longest of his articles.See: Robert Schumann: On Music and Musicians. University of California Press, 1946, p. 164 Theo Hirsbrunner has pointed out other signs of influence of Berlioz on Schumann.Hirsbrunner, Theo: Schumann und Berlioz. Ein Franzose in Deutschland, Laaber-Verlag, Laaber 2005 The same idea is used as opening for the next movement of Nachtst√ºcke in varied form (stepwise descending and ascending seconds, with a characteristic accentuation of the upbeat quarter, again reminding the upbeat half note of the ostinato theme in the fourth movement of Symphonie Fantastique). The theme is recapitulated in heroic fashion before collapsing into nothingness. The omissions of chords and the subsequent 'melodic holes' in the last four bars foreshadow 20th century techniques. = Nachtst√ºck 2 = Curious gathering F Major Kuriose Versammlung - (Markiert und lebhaft \\"Marked and lively\\") abounds with frequent digressions. The constant mood shifts‚Äîfrom frolicsome derisiveness to clownish, coquettish mirth‚Äîresult in a lack of cohesiveness. The programmatic title indicates that this effect was probably intended by Schumann. The mechanical quality of the middle part suggests an ‚Äòautomaton'. (The mechanism winds down at the ritardando, B‚ô≠. 93-94). The idea of an artificial ‚Äòperson‚Äô haunted Romantic imagination and 'automatons' appear frequently in writers such as E.T.A. Hoffmann or Edgar Allan Poe (1809‚Äì49). Carl Reinecke included ‚ÄòGodfather Drosselmeyer‚Äôs Automatons‚Äô from Hoffmann's fairy tale The Nutcracker and the Mouse King in his piano four-hand setting of the tale. Hoffmann's narration Der Sandmann from Nachtst√ºcke introduces the famous Olimpia automaton. Nathanael, who is the main character in this narration, falls in love with Olimpia, forgetting his true love, Clara. = Nachtst√ºck 3 = Night binge D‚ô≠ Major N√§chtliches Gelage - (Mit gro√üer Lebhaftigkeit \\"With great vivacity\\") maybe described as a ‚Äònocturnal Faschingsschwank‚Äô or 'noctural \\"Carnival Scene\\"' and there are unmistakable similarities between these two pieces written at Vienna. But the passion is less healthy in the Nachtst√ºcke. An intoxicated yearning explodes in impulsive outbursts of energy followed by ecstatic reveling. These indulgences are interrupted by two 'intermezzos', the first one a sinister murmuring of repressed agitation, the second one a ghostly 'Wilde Jagd' (Wild Hunt). Apparently unrelated fragments, these episodes do have a close motivic relationship: The first ‚Äòintermezzo‚Äô is fashioned from the closing section of the main theme and the second ‚Äòintermezzo‚Äô imitates the climax of the main theme's A‚ô≠ major section. = Nachtst√ºck 4 = Roundelay with solo voices F Major Schumann is often criticized for using structure merely as a framework on which to spread the themes. The resultant ‚Äòincoherency‚Äô is often attributed to the composer's declining mental health. The fact though remains that Schumann's predilection for allusions has rendered many relationships too subtle for the (non artistic) analyst's senses. Rundgesang mit Solostimmen - (Ad libitum. Einfach \\"Freely. Simple\\"), for example, certainly remembers the march rhythm of the Funeral Procession but has been changed to a simple folk melody, lute-like arpeggios have been added and the displacement of the dotted rhythm has been 'corrected', evoking a feeling of consolation. The extremely laconic introduction is a blissfully superfluous exclamation of ‚ÄòEusebius‚Äô announcing a conclusive epilogue.

In the following year, he began to play in the band Super Som Mirim. At 16, he moved to Jo√£o Pessoa for his high school studies, focusing on journalism and, at the same time, playing in the group Jaguaribe Carne, which worked with vanguard poetry. At 21, he moved to S√£o Paulo, soon becoming acquainted with members of the vanguarda paulista (S√£o Paulo's vanguard) musicians like Arrigo Barnab√© and Itamar Assump√ß√£o. While working at a daily gig as a journalist, he continued to improve his viol√£o playing and compositions, realizing live performances and beginning to gather a faithful fan audience. In 1991, he went to Europe where performed with success in Germany. Upon returning, he decided to abandon journalism and dedicate himself exclusively to music. Forming the band Cuscuz Cl√£ (a pun with the hated anti-Negro organization), he recorded the CD Aos Vivos in 1995, produced independently, and later sold to Velas, where he accompanied himself on the viol√£o at a live recorded show. The album had as guest stars Lenine and Larry Goldin (recovered from ostracism, after an important contribution to Tropicalia). \\"Mama √Åfrica\\" and \\"√Ä Primeira Vista\\" became hits, and when Daniela Mercury recorded the latter in an interpretation that was included in the major soap opera Rei do Gado, his fame was solidified. The success of critique came in 1996, with Cuscuz Cl√£ (MZA/Polygram), which granted him the Pr√™mio Sharp as Revelation (1995) and APCA's as Best Composer. The clip \\"Mama √Åfrica\\" received the Pr√™mio MTV Music Awards as Best 1996 MPB VideoClip como Melhor VideoClip. \\"√Ä Primeira Vista\\" won the Best Song prize of the Trof√©u Imprensa (SBT) and was included in a CD by Argentinean star Pedro Aznar.

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 17 March 1916 by D. Appleton & Company, New York, and in the United Kingdom on 4 October 1917 by Methuen & Co., London.McIlvaine (1990), A19, pp. 29‚Äì30. The story had earlier been serialised in the U.S in the Saturday Evening Post from December 1915, and in the UK in the Strand Magazine starting December 1916. Taking place primarily in New York City and then-rural Long Island, the story tells of amiable but hard-up \\"Bill\\", Lord Dawlish, who inherits a fortune from a rich American he once helped in golf. When Bill learns that the rich man left nothing to his niece Elizabeth Boyd, he feels uneasy and decides to give half the money to her, though this turns out to be unexpectedly difficult. Some of the characters and locations in the novel appear in other Wodehouse stories. Publicist Roscoe Sherriff appears in Indiscretions of Archie (1921), and young lawyer Gerald \\"Jerry\\" Nichols returns in Bachelors Anonymous (1973). New York restaurant Reigelheimer's is referenced in the short story \\"The Aunt and the Sluggard\\" (1916), the village of Brookport appears again in Jill the Reckless (1920), and the character Claire Fenwick travels on the White Star Line steamship Atlantic, which is featured in The Girl on the Boat (1921). Plot William FitzWilliam Delamere Chalmers, Lord Dawlish, or \\"Bill\\", makes his living as a London club secretary. His beautiful fianc√©e, Claire Fenwick, will not marry him unless he makes more money. Bill hopes to make money in America, and his American friend Gates lends Bill the keys to his New York apartment. Claire gets a letter from her American friend Pauline or \\"Polly\\", who married Algie, Lord Wetherby, another impecunious English lord. Polly is earning a large salary in New York dancing at Reigelheimer's Restaurant. She invites Claire to visit, and mentions that she bought a snake named Clarence and a monkey named Eustace for publicity as directed by her press agent, Roscoe Sherriff. Bill learns from his friend, lawyer Jerry Nichols, that he inherited a million pounds from Ira Nutcombe, an American whom Bill once helped at golf. The millionaire left his nephew only twenty pounds, and nothing to his niece, to whom he had left all his money in older wills. Bill feels he should see her and split the money with her. The niece, Elizabeth Boyd, is a hard-working beekeeper in Brookport, Long Island, where she lives with her irresponsible brother \\"Nutty\\", Claude Nutcombe Boyd. A letter from Jerry informs them that Nutcombe's money went to someone called Lord Dawlish. In New York, Bill sends a letter to Elizabeth offering to split the money, but she sends a reply refusing. Nutty, a friend of Gates, shows up at Gates's apartment and meets Bill. He invites Bill, who only calls himself Bill Chalmers, to join him with friends at Reigelheimer's. At the restaurant, Claire sees Bill, who crashes loudly into a waiter while dancing, but does not approach him because Polly's rich friend Dudley Pickering is interested in Claire. Nutty learns Bill is Lord Dawlish, and, hoping to get some money, invites him to the bee farm. Elizabeth is initially annoyed when Nutty brings a stranger home, but she bonds with Bill over beekeeping and golf. Since she is angry at Lord Dawlish, feeling he tried to give her charity, Bill keeps his identity secret. Polly brings Algie, Claire, Dudley, and the monkey to her house in Brookport. Dudley and Claire get engaged. She sees Bill again, and breaks up with him, using the excuse that she saw Bill dancing with a girl at Reigelheimer's. Dudley, concerned by recent local burglaries, suspects Bill is a thief. At Polly's house, the monkey throws eggs and plates, and bites Dudley, then runs off. Nutty sees the monkey, but Elizabeth, who wants Nutty to stop drinking, pretends not to see it, and Nutty swears off drink. Elizabeth decides to keep the monkey for a day or two in case Nutty changes his mind. Bill discovers that Claire got engaged to Dudley shortly before breaking up with him. Claire denies knowing Bill, making Dudley more certain Bill is a burglar. Dudley investigates the bee farm carrying a revolver, and accidentally fires his gun and kills the monkey without realizing it. Bill and Elizabeth find the dead monkey, and uncertain of what to do, they carry him away. Dudley follows, thinking they are burglars carrying their loot, and Elizabeth hears him. She gets scared, but Bill comforts her and they confess their feelings for each other. They leave the dead monkey in Algie's shack, which Dudley enters. He is found there by Polly, Algie, and Claire. They rebuke Dudley for shooting the monkey and Claire ends their engagement. Claire finds out about Bill's inheritance and tries to win him back, but he refuses, being happily engaged to Elizabeth. Claire insists that Elizabeth knows who Bill is and is marrying him for his money, and returns to Dudley. Nutty, mistakenly believing Elizabeth got engaged to Bill for the money, tries to console her. Bill overhears this, and thinks that Claire was right. Elizabeth explains that Nutty told her Bill was Lord Dawlish days ago but she truly loves him. Bill believes her, but Elizabeth, afraid that Bill will come to doubt her feelings for him, tells him to go, and he reluctantly leaves for the city. Jerry Nichols appears, and asks Elizabeth not to tell his father, the head of his legal firm, about how he acted prematurely; Nutcombe actually left his money to Elizabeth in his final will. Nutty celebrates with Jerry while Elizabeth rushes off and catches Bill's train. They plan to get married when the train reaches New York and later run a big bee farm together. Background The exclusive club that Bill works for as secretary in the beginning of the novel, Brown's, was based on a real London club, White's. Brown's is stated in the first chapter of Uneasy Money to be located in St James Street; White's is in fact located in St James's Street. In the last chapter, Elizabeth and Bill decide to get married in a church \\"on Twenty-ninth Street, just round the corner from Fifth Avenue\\"; this is a reference to the Little Church Around the Corner, where Wodehouse married his wife Ethel in 1914.McCrum (2004), p. 112. The fictional village in the novel, Brookport, was likely inspired by Bellport, a village in Brookhaven, New York, where the Wodehouses lived in the first years of their marriage. Publication history The story was published as a serial in the Saturday Evening Post between 4 December 1915 and 15 January 1916, and in the Strand Magazine between December 1916 and June 1917. It was the second novel Wodehouse sold to George Horace Lorimer of the Post, after Something Fresh.McCrum (2004), p. 120. Both serials were published in seven parts. The Post serial is nearly identical to the US edition book, and the Strand serial is nearly identical to the UK edition book. Illustrations by Clarence F. Underwood were used for both serials.McIlvaine (1990), D59.11‚Äì17, p. 155, and D133.52‚Äì58. The US edition is dedicated: \\"To My Wife, Bless Her\\". The first US edition featured a frontispiece and seven illustrations by Clarence F. Underwood. Underwood drew the colour illustration on the front of the dust jacket, which appeared in black and white facing page 222 of the text (and in the final part of both magazine serials). A new foreword by Wodehouse was printed in the 1976 UK edition. A volume containing both Uneasy Money and Aunts Aren't Gentlemen was published by Heron Books in London in the 1970s. The book, designed by William B. Taylor, was one of a set of eighteen volumes published by Heron Books, each containing two Wodehouse books.McIlvaine (1990), Kc18, p. 323. Adaptations A silent film adaptation, also titled Uneasy Money, was released in 1918.

It contrasts in particular with primogeniture (common in feudal society), which requires that the whole or most of the inheritance passes to the eldest son, and with agnatic seniority where the succession passes to next senior male. Partible inheritance systems are therefore common ones to be found, in both Common Law and Napoleonic Code-based systems; in the latter case, there may be further requirement implying division according to a scheme, such as equal shares for legitimate children. Partible inheritance has been common in ancient Celtic and Germanic tribal societies; an example of this pattern is so-called Salic patrimony. Historically speaking, non-partible inheritance has been associated with monarchies, and the wish that landed estates be kept together as units. In the Middle Ages, the partible inheritance systems of (for example) the Carolingian Empire and Kievan Rus had the effect of dividing kingdoms into princely states and are often thought responsible for their decline of power. Partible inheritance was the generally accepted form of inheritance adopted by New Englanders in the 18th century. The southern colonies adopted a system of male primogeniture in cases of intestacy, while the northern colonies adopted a system of partible inheritance in cases of intestacy, with the eldest son receiving a double portion of the estate. In practice, a strong bequest motive in the colonies adopting multigeniture reduced the variability in demographic experiences across colonies with different inheritance systems.

COIs are a strategy that fall under the realm of computer security which itself is a subset of security engineering. Typically, COIs are set up to protect a network infrastructure from a group or groups of users who are performing some esoteric functions. COIs are also designed to protect their user community from the rest of the enclave user population. Not only does this refer to the simplicity of the network, but it also includes a group of people that come together on different social networks that come together to share data. There are multiple examples such as Wikipedia, Facebook, Blogs, YouTube, and many more where people come together as a community of interest to work together towards a common goal, learn from each other, critique, and share ideas. These users and group of people are separated into categories and segregated into logical groups. There can be professional groups, health groups that include people interested in specific diets, business groups, self-start up groups, and so many other countless categories. A COI is a group of professionals and advisors that share business insights, technical expertise, challenges, and perspectives. Definition A COI can be defined as a logical or physical grouping of network devices or users with access to information that should not be made available to the general user population on a LAN or WAN infrastructure. A COI can be used to provide multiple levels of protection for a LAN or WAN infrastructure from the activities within a COI. A COI can consist of a logical perimeter around the community (or enclave). It can allow for separate security management and operational direction. COI's generally do not dictate separate internal security policies (e.g., password policies, etc.) because they fall under the jurisdiction and management of the LAN or WAN owners. However, they can and often do have a laxed subset of the overall Network security policy. The terms \\"Segregation Mechanism\\" and \\"Security Mechanism\\" for the purposes of this article are interchangeable. The COI segregates in order to achieve security. A distinction between the CoP's and the CoI's A CoP may operate with any of the following attributes: * Some sponsorship * A vision and/or mission statement * Goals and/or objectives * A core team and/or general membership * Expected outcomes and/or impacts * Measures of success * Description of operating processes * Assumptions and/or dependencies * Review and/or reflection Often CoIs span similar organizations (e.g., DoD, particularly when there is a common interest in an outcome). Individual members may be expected to: * Support the CoP through participation and review/validation of products * Attempt to wear the \\"one hat\\" associated with the CoP while maintaining the integrity and autonomy of their individual organizations. * Participate voluntarily with the blessing of their organizations that determine their level of participation and investment. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"1\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" bordercolorlight=\\"#666699\\" bordercolordark=\\"#666699\\" bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" mm_noconvert=\\"TRUE\\" - bgcolor=\\"#FFFFFF\\" ! colspan=\\"3\\" class=\\"dark\\"  COI Types and Mechanisms - ! class=\\"dark\\"  Segregation Mechanism ! class=\\"dark\\"  Cost ! class=\\"dark\\"  Description - ! bgcolor=\\"#FFCCCC\\" class=\\"dark\\"  MS Active Directory  align=\\"CENTER\\" class=\\"dark\\"  Low  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFCC\\" class=\\"dark\\"  Provides logical separation in the form of group formations utilizing MS Active Directory controls. - ! bgcolor=\\"#FFCCCC\\" class=\\"dark\\"  VLAN  align=\\"CENTER\\" class=\\"dark\\"  Medium  bgcolor=\\"#FFFFCC\\" class=\\"dark\\"  Provides logical separation and network layer 2 separation (see the OSI model for more information).

Very high cost because network resources cannot be leveraged against. } Security mechanisms COI security requirements can range in sophistication from simple network file shares to an interconnection of physically separate sites that are connected via dedicated communication circuits. COI security mechanisms and the respective basic characteristics are identified in the Table. These security mechanisms may be utilized individually and in combinations to provide the requisite security for each COI. COI architecture can overlay the existing LAN or WAN architecture in order to maximize the use of existing resources and to provide the required COI separation in the most efficient manner. COIs that require additional dedicated physical resources (e.g., dedicated router, VPN and firewalls devices) are usually more complex in nature and expensive to operate because of the added network devices and the personnel to operate and manage them. They also add the benefit of more security utilizing the defense in depth approach. A COI does not necessarily imply a physical separation of the infrastructure, but can do so. Construction A standard approach to COI segregation can be through the use of group policies if the LAN or WAN infrastructure utilizes the Microsoft Windows operating system utilizing the Active Directory service. Additional dedicated COI boundary security components such as a router, VPN, firewall, and IDS can be provided depending upon the requirement needs of a COI. COIs can be designed and deployed by employing the security mechanisms that are listed in the Table. Typically each individual COI may have unique characteristics and requirements. The security mechanisms listed above are the basic building blocks in the construction of all COIs.

The origin of beer pong is generally credited to Dartmouth College.\\"Filmmakers drop into town for pong history documentary\\" , The Dartmouth History The origins of the game are obscure but it has been attributed to a Dartmouth College fraternity party. An Alpha Phi Delta fraternity alumnus, David Thielscher, class of 1954, recalled in an interview for The Dartmouth newspaper that beer pong was played when he was an undergraduate.Jacob, Jess (1997). \\"More than a game: Pong goes way back\\" . The Dartmouth. Oct. 16, 1997. History professor Jere Daniell '55 stated that he played the game as a student, and Bob Shirley '57 stated that he began playing in 1956. (Shirley suggests that the game began when spectators rested their cups of beer on a table during a ping-pong game). One of the earliest published photographs depicting a game of pong appeared in Colorado School of Mines' 1961 yearbook The Prospector. Dartmouth's 1968 yearbook Aegis (page 304) also has a published photograph of a game of pong. Beer pong at Dartmouth was the only college-sponsored drinking competition in the country, until 1977 when the college decided to discontinue its sponsorship of the games.Rathod, Anoop (2005). \\"Without a Paddle\\" . The Dartmouth Independent, Sep. 19, 2005. Official derecognition would not reduce the level of beer pong activity at Dartmouth or elsewhere, but would lead to many new variations on the game. According to a 1999 article in The New York Times, pong \\"has been part of fraternity life for at least 40 years, as hallowed as rush or Winter Carnival\\". Other Ivy League newspapers have called Dartmouth \\"the spiritual home of beer pong\\", and characterized pong as \\"a way for Dartmouth frat boys to get drunk [that] has become what is arguably America's favorite drinking game\\". In the early 1970s, Dartmouth briefly sanctioned the game as an intramural sport, making it the only college-sponsored drinking contest in the country. In 1977, Dartmouth ended this practice.The Dartmouth Independent: Without a Paddle By the mid-1980s Pong was well established at several universities, including Bowdoin College, Lehigh University, Lafayette College, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, Whitman College, and Williams College. By 1976, students began publishing articles about the game. =Statistics= A 2004 survey of Dartmouth students provided these statistics: *About 60 percent of students had played pong at least once within the two weeks prior to the survey. *About 20 percent of students have never played pong. *Tree requires the average team to consume 7.3 drinks, Shrub 5.7 drinks, Line/Death 5.2 drinks, and Ship 7.4 drinks. Gameplay No \\"official\\" codified version of the rules of pong exist, and many \\"house rules\\" variations exist. In general terms, players start by assembling cups of beer or other obstacles onto either side of a pong table and placing a median at the center of the table. Like table tennis, pong requires one side to serve the ball and the other side to attempt to return the ball, thus beginning a rally. Both the serve and the intra-game volleys generally must propel in an arch trajectory. Players may not return the ball until it has struck their own side, objects on their side, or the floor. Following the serve, players attempt to hit or sink in the opponents cups, whereby the opponent will lose one or more points. Once all points for a cup or obstacle have been taken away, the object is removed. The game is won when all objects have been removed from the opponents side. =Equipment= Pong requires a table, paddles, a ball, cups, and liquid‚Äîpreferably beer. Also, some rules require a median of some sort to be utilized. *The table is not a regulation ping-pong table but is made from one or two sheets of plywood, usually measuring 4'x8', 5'x9', or 5'x10'. However, a regular ping-pong table may be utilized if available. The sheets are propped up on supports such as sawhorses, garbage cans, or frames specially built from lumber or steel pipes. *The median is a divider placed across the center of the table, such as a pole, hockey stick, broom handle, or the net of a table tennis set. *Paddles are commercial ping pong paddles, sometimes in modified form to suit the house rules. Typically, the handles are broken off. *Cups are predominantly twelve ounce plastic cups arranged in a predetermined configuration. Sixteen ounce cups are utilized as well, however are frowned upon as they provide a much larger target which enables less skilled player to flourish. *Beer (or water for water pong, cocktails for tails pong, champagne for champong) fills each cup approximately 5/6ths of the way full before each game. =Configurations= Cups or obstacles may be assembled in a number of configurations. Often these configurations vary widely between groups, with players remaining very loyal to their original form of play. *Two Cup: Two cups are placed next to each other a set distance from the edge of the pong table, typically one paddle length. Two cup can be played for points and/or simply until your two cups are gone. **Four Cup: Each of the two player on one side have their own \\"Two Cup\\" set up. **The Unholy: One cup with a shot of J√§germeister, is placed in front of the single beer glass one paddle length ahead on the center line. If the shot glass is hit during play, the person hitting the shot glass must drink: hence the name \\"The Unholy\\". *Line: An expansion of \\"Two Cup\\" to any number of cups lined up in a single row a set distance from the edge of the pong table, typically one paddle length. **Wall: Cups in a line across the width of the table. **Great Wall: Cups lining all sides of the table. **Death: Nine cups in a line (SigEp c.1990-2010). *Shrub: A six cup triangle centered on each end, a paddle's width from the edge of the table, with a single 'stem' cup behind them. **Triangle: A variation of Shrub with the base along the back line of the table, and no stem. **Tree: An eleven cup variant with a ten cup triangle. **Double-stemmed Tree: A twelve cup variant with a ten cup triangle and two stem cups. **Sequoia: A seventeen cup variant with a 15 cup triangle and two stem cups. **Tower: A twenty-one cup variant. The base consists of a \\"Tree,\\" a \\"shrub\\" is carefully balanced on top of the base. A miniature three-cup tree is balanced on the \\"shrub\\" and finally a single cup is balanced on the top. **Sequoia Tower: A thirty-eight cup variant. \\"Tower\\" with a \\"Sequoia\\" base. **Enchanted Forest: Typically played with two pong tables placed side by side. The number of players is unlimited to the extent that the tables get too crowded. Each player starts with a \\"Tree\\" and once your last cup is gone‚Äîmagically another \\"Tree\\" appears in front of you. Etiquette dictates that you do not hit towards the person immediately to your left or right, but etiquette quickly dissipates as the game proceeds. The game ends when you decide to walk away. **Social: Same as \\"Enchanted Forest\\" but each player has a \\"Shrub\\" instead of a \\"Tree\\" and 2 ping pong balls are in play at any given time. *Ship or Battleship: A configuration modeled after the classic board game Battleship. Each team positions five \\"boats\\" aligned to a grid. The \\"boats\\" consist of one 5-cup arrangement, one 4-cup arrangement, two 3-cup arrangements, and one 2-cup arrangement, similar to the board game. Additionally, there is a \\"mine\\" or two which if hit by an opponent is drunk by the opponent. Standard formation usually requires placement of the 5 and 4 \\"boats\\" on the right and left edge of your side of the table, with the 3 \\"boat\\" at an angle on the center line between the 5 and 4 \\"boats.\\" The 2 \\"boat\\" is usually placed at the closest possible point to your opponents side of the table‚Äîit is also placed at an angle. Usually the \\"mine\\" is movable and refilled upon being sunk. Further, when any of your \\"boats\\" are reduced to 2.5 cups, a sink on any of the cups in that boat results in the sinking of the entire boat, which must be removed from play. Often played with a single paddle per side. **Harbor or Pearl Harbor: Originally called 8-Man. A variant on \\"Ship\\" where two pong tables are placed side by side. There are 4 teams each defending a corner of the pong field, instead of the normal short side of the table. A 6-cup \\"boat\\" is added to the game, as well as an additional \\"mine.\\" Again, the \\"mine\\" may be movable and may be refilled. *Battlestar: A combination of \\"Ship\\" and \\"Tree.\\" **Battlestar Gallatica: A combination of \\"Tower\\" and \\"Ship\\" **Towerstar Gabootica: A combination of \\"Sequoia Tower\\" and \\"Ship\\" =Games of Lore= *Tic-Tac-Toe: A massive game, in which all likelihood substitutions will be required, as 81 cups are placed on each side of the table. The cups are sets up in 9 groupings of 9 cups obviously in the formation of a Tic-tac-toe board. You win by getting rid of three 9 cup groupings as per the normal rules of Tic-tac-toe. *Table: Another massive game. Cups are set up to cover the entire surface of the table. A player must continue to serve and incur penalties until they have cleared a space on the table large enough to legally serve. =Basic Rules of Play= Start of game: There are many ways to begin a game of pong; game start usually depends upon the rules of the house in which you are playing. It may also depend upon if the game is individual or tournament play. *Tournament Play: Standard practice is to volley for serve. *Individual Play: In individual play a team has many options: (1) volleying for serve; (2) challenging team must serve first, (3) volunteering to serve first, & (4) tossing the ball similar to Beirut. Serve: A player serves by striking the ball so that it makes contact with their own side once, immediately followed by contact with the opposing side. *Ace: A serve resulting in the ball bouncing in an awkward fashion, such as off the cornered edge of the table, is called an ace. An ace is legal and generally sought after by experienced players. *Service Fault: Failing to contact the opposing side on a serve is considered a fault. Often a predetermined number of faults results in the serving team losing points or drinking from their own cups. Most house rules provide that a game cannot end on a serve fault, which provides a strategic advantage to a team on the verge of loss. *Service Hit: Making contact with cups or obstacles on the opposing side when serving is considered a service hit. A service hit results in the serving team being penalized. Standard penalties involve the loss of points or drinking from one's own cups. *Dirty Serve: Serving in a disreputable manner, such as striking a ball that is already bouncing or squeezing the ball between the thumb and paddle, is considered a dirty serve. A dirty serve is typically legal, but frowned upon. Volley: After the serve, teams alternate striking the ball onto the opposing team's side of the table. End of volley: A volley ends when the ball bounces twice, misses the opposite side, is double hit, or hits or sinks in the cups. A team that causes the volley to end by missing the opposing side or allowing the ball to bounce twice must then serve the ball to restart play. A hit or sink against an opponent results in the opponent serving the ball to restart play. *A Hit: Striking the opponents cups during a volley is considered a hit. Usually the opponents will lose one point or drink. Standard penalty for drinking is typically half a cup. *Sink: Having the ball come to rest in one of the opponents cups during a volley is considered a sink. Usually the penalty for the opponents would be doubled, costing two points or resulting in the drinking of the entire cup. When not playing points, a sunk cup must be removed from play. *Double hit: A team striking the ball twice is considered to have double hit the ball. This generally results in the end of a volley. End of Game: A game is ended in two ways; a designated number of points are attained through hits and sinks or all the cups on one's side have been removed. =Secondary rules= In general, and particularly when playing \\"lob\\" pong any save type does not require the ball to travel in an arc pattern; rather the ball simply must strike your opponents side of the table. The means of getting the ball there is irrelevant. *Save: Immediately after the ball strikes a team's cups, the team may attempt a subsequent return called a save. A save generally cancels the penalty associated with the hit. *Cup Save: When the ping pong ball hits an opponent's cup and the ball bounces high and far enough to cross back over to a team's side, negating the hit penalty. *Throw Save: Throwing one's paddle to save a hit penalty. Usually occurs, when a team's cup is hit on the edge or side closest to the opponent, and the ping pong ball ricochets back toward the opponent's side but not far enough to avoid hitting a team's side of the table twice, which would result in the hit penalty being accessed. Because of the ricochet of the ball and the distance from a player, the player is required to throw their paddle in an attempt to hit the ball over to the opponent's side. *Blow Save: Where a ping pong ball hits a cup and while swirling around the cup about to \\"sink\\" into the cup, but before the ball touches the beer, a player blows air under the ball and pops it out of the cup. Obviously, this only saves a \\"sink,\\" and a penalty for a hit is still accessed unless the player in the same motion is able to hit the ball onto the opponent's side. This type of save is contentious. *Save hit: In attempting a save, if a player strikes the opponents cups, it is generally referred to as a save hit. A save hit often results in the players on whom the hit was made losing a point or drink. *Save sink: In attempting a save, if a player strikes the ball so that it comes to rest in the opponents cups, it is generally referred to as a save sink. The consequence of a save sink is often the dual-doubling of the combined save and sink, costing in four points or drinks in the general course of play. *Floor shot: On hitting the floor, a team may attempt one final shot to hit the opponents cups called a floor shot. Hitting or sinking from a floor shot is generally considered the same as hitting or sinking during a volley. A floor shot may similarly be saved, although the volley is still terminated once all save shots have completed. This type of save is rarely allowed; standard practice requires that the striking of the ball on the floor ends a volley. *Ceiling Slam: In certain houses, when a lobbed ball hits the ceiling, the returning team has the option to \\"Slam\\" or return the volley without lobbing, thus increasing their chances of hitting cups and making saves more difficult. Variants =Lob pong= The game mirrors the basic form of a friendly game of regulation table tennis. Each serve and return must complete an arc acceptable to opponents and observers, though the goal of sinking the ball in a cup tends to reward returning in the proper form. Hitting an opponent's cup means one-fifth, one- half or simply a \\"sip\\" of the cup is drunk (depending on the school), and sinking a ball in a cup (aka, a \\"plop\\") means that a player or a team must drink a half or the entire cup. Spilling one's own cup usually merits drinking an entire cup of freshly poured beer. Other beverages than beer, including water or cocktails, are sometimes permitted, but some beverage is necessary. Service The ball is properly served by striking it with the paddle, ensuring it bounces only once off the serving team's half of the table, and then lands on the opposing team's half. If the ball hits an opponent's cup the serving team must drink one sip from their cup and serve again. This is a \\"fault\\". If the serve lands in an opponent's cup the serving team must drink an entire beer. This is also a \\"fault\\". Two \\"faults\\" are allowed if the ball fails to make its second bounce on the opponent's half of the table. If a server faults three times, the opponent gets one point and the server must continue serving. Note that hitting or sinking on the serve do not count as faults; in this case, the opponent collects 1 or 2 points respectively and immediately gets to serve. Since a game cannot be lost on a service error, at match point the losing server has an unlimited number of \\"faults\\", and the server does not lose points or service if the opponent's cup is accidentally hit or sunk on the serve. As a result, the server should keep trying for the best serve possible when the opponent is at match point. Some players institute a three-fault rule, however, the violation of which requires that a full beer be drunk. A related strategy is to foul up the ball and intentionally serve it into your opponent's cup. If you are able to sink it later, your opponent must drink a fouled beverage. This is known as \\"intentional gorfing\\". In some places, continuing service after the ball has hit a cup is, not only commendable, but results in \\"one on\\". Roughly explained, if a cup has been hit and the opponent is able to keep the ball in play, there will be \\"one drink\\" on the table. The losing side of that service will not only lose a point, but will have the pleasure of drinking a \\"drink\\" from their cup. Obviously this rule is not limited to just one hit of a cup but can expand infinitely, depending upon the skill of the players. Return The ball must be returned after it has bounced just once off the returning team's half of the table; this includes the table top and the cups. Blowing a spinning ball out of a cup and returning it is sometimes permitted and is highly frowned upon unless done by girls. Ricocheting the ball off external objects such as a vertical or horizontal structural member in the basement, a ceiling, or a bystander is usually permitted. If a ball is extremely hard to return or if it is \\"un-returnable\\", both teams can agree to call it a \\"DB,\\" \\"Dive-bomb,\\" or \\"stoner.\\" If a \\"DB\\" or \\"stoner\\" is agreed upon, then the point is played over. There are a number of formal variants of Lob, including the standard Two-Cup (one full cup per player), Four-Cup (two full cups per player), Shrub (a triangle of six beers with a \\"stem\\" attached to one side), Tree (much like Shrub, except the triangle includes 10 beers), Line (with four half cups per player), Full-Cup Line or Wall (cups in a line across the width of the table), Great Wall (cups lining all sides of the table), Table (cups covering the surface; one must foul out to clear a space on his own side for service), Battleship (or 'Ship, two lines of three cups and one line of five, four and two cups placed strategically, similar to the formations in the board game Battleship), Rotating Randomness (irregular groups of cups placed in irregular pie-shaped sections of the table and played by six or more people who change positions after each point, encouraging shifting ad-hoc team behavior), and Henge (stacked cups or trilithons in irregular pie-shaped zones, with each player having a separate \\"Tourist\\" cup whose strategic drinking out of turn imposes the requirement that all others drink theirs, and other ritual elements). Hoop pong This version is similar to \\"lob pong\\" but with key differences. This game is always played as either a one-on-one or doubles match, with one keg cup of beer per person. The game is always played to 21 points, and victor(s) must win by at least 2. When a side reaches 20 points, or any time thereafter when its total is one point ahead of the other side, the match is at game point. The winning side must end the game with a \\"hoop\\" (see below); when at game point, merely hitting the opponent's cup does not result in an additional point for the leading team, though a sip is \\"on the table\\" (see below). An optional (though highly recommended) variation employs the \\"hoop rule\\", in which the winning side must tally at least as many \\"hoops\\" as the other side. Under this condition, the winning hoop cannot come until the winning side has at least evened the hoop count. Any hoop that comes on game point prior to the hoop that evens the count does not result in an additional point for the leading team, but shall be treated as any other hoop in terms of drinking requirements. Between evenly matched foes, the \\"hoop rule\\" can result in quite lengthy competitions and continued debauchery long into the night. It is believed, though not confirmed, that the record for the most \\"hoops\\" in a game is 17. Of course if an opponent feels the sudden urge to \\"boot\\", a good sportsman always allows a short break, though said opponent is then expected to \\"rally\\". Anything less would be uncivilized. =Service= The ball is properly served by striking it with the paddle, ensuring it bounces only once off the serving team's half of the table, and then lands on the opposing team's half. If the ball hits an opponent's cup the serving team must drink one sip from their cup and serve again. If the serve lands in an opponent's cup the serving team must drink an entire beer. If the ball fails to make its second bounce on the opponent's half of the table after two attempts, the serving team must take a sip and continue serving. No points are awarded to either side on the serve. Service changes sides after every combined 5 points. In doubles play, teammates must alternate serving the 5 point sets with each side change. =Return= The ball must be returned after it has bounced just once off the returning team's half of the table; this includes the table top and the cups. Ricocheting the ball off external objects is permitted. Points may be scored anytime after the first serve. Points are scored one at a time for either a \\"hoop\\" (the return lands in the opponent's cup) or for hitting the opponent's cup followed by the opponent's failure to make a successful return. When a hoop occurs, the side whose cup was \\"hooped\\" drinks an entire beer per team member. When a hit cup occurs (without a successful return), the side whose cup was hit drinks one sip per team member. A successful return off a hit cup negates the point, but a sip is \\"on the table\\", and the side that fails to sustain the rally must take a sip at its conclusion. If a ball hits the edge of the table at any time and is thus impossible to return both teams can agree to call it a \\"stoner\\" and replay the point. =Cabin Rules= This variant, created by Rob Simon of Vanderbilt University, consists of a neat combination of Lob Pong and the Gentlemen's game, but retains more of a focus on gamesmanship than other versions. Within this set of rules, it is the receiving team that may deem a serve or lob \\"low,\\" which often creates strife when true students of gamesmanship make questionable calls. =Fast pong= As the name suggests, fast pong happens at a faster pace than lob pong. While there are many variations of the game, one major difference is that the goal is often just to hit the opponents cup and sinking the ball into the cup happens much less frequently. The game can be played either with points (with each hit counting as a point) or with drinks (with each hit requiring the opponent to drink a certain amount of beer, usually half of the 12-ounce cup). =Bucknell variant= Purpose of game and winning The purpose of Bucknell pong (referred to as \\"pong\\" to Bucknellians) is to hit the opponents' cup three times. After one hit, the team being hit has to drink half of their beverage. After the second hit the team must drink the rest. After the third hit the team loses. One can also win the game by hitting the ball into the opponents' cup once. If that happens, the game automatically ends and the losing team must chug their beverage. In this style of pong, the ball is never out of play and one side always has the option to take a shot from wherever the ball lies, whether on the floor, in the garbage, or in an empty cup. Table and table lay-out The Pong Table sits 33 inches off the ground and the surface area is exactly 9'x5'. Because the Pong Table is a close sibling to the ping pong table, two hinges for a net should be fastened at the middle point of the table. Additionally, a flattened ping pong net should lie between and connected to the hinges. While Pong can be played with actual ping pong paddles, the more traditional and acceptable way to play involves paddles which use sandpaper-like material as padding and have the handles broken off. Four 12-oz cups of beer should be placed on opposing sides of the table, one for each of the four players. The placement may be six inches from both the end and the side of the table, but it is most important that it remain uniform for all four players, ensuring that no team gains an advantage. Typically, one side of the table is declared ‚ÄúWinners‚Äô Side‚Äù, and the team that wins the previous match will play on that side while the challengers will use ‚ÄúLosers‚Äô Side‚Äù. Service and return The serve must always be made to the person standing diagonally across the table and needs to hit both sides of the table. If it doesn't, the opposing team has the choice to accept the serve or to call out ‚ÄúOne Side‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo Sides‚Äù and give the ball back to the serving team. If the team serving the ball hits any cup with the ball, that will be considered ‚ÄúA Hit‚Äù against the serving team and they will serve the ball again unless that would be the third hit against them. If the serve knocks over a cup, regardless of how much beer is in the cup (or if the cup is empty), the serving team loses the match and must chug one cup of beer as a penalty. When the opposing team serves the ball, the receiving player can either hit it with his paddle immediately or choose to hit it off of his body for a better shot. The latter maneuver is called ‚ÄúA Body‚Äù. If the ball hits either of the receiving players‚Äô hands, arms, or paddles, it is considered that player's shot. \\"Bodying\\" the ball Players have the choice of either hitting the ball off of the table or ‚ÄúBodying‚Äù it to either side for a better shot off of the ground. Because a player's hands and arms are considered extensions of the paddle, you cannot Body the ball with either your hands or arms. If you do, this is considered a shot. You also cannot body the ball with your foot or your leg below the knee. This is a ‚ÄúFoot‚Äù and the player that does this should pick up the ball and serve. Additionally, you cannot Body a ball that has already hit the floor, even if done by accident. If the ball gets stuck in an article of clothing, that player may take one step before inducing the ball to drop on the floor, at which time normal play resumes. This is the same rule if the ball rolls into an empty cup. Defense While the opposing team takes a shot, a player has the choice of playing defense (more commonly referred to a \\"D\\") by placing either their hand or their paddle in front of their cup. Some players consider this weak, but it is a common and acceptable practice. Defense only works against a ball that has already hit the table. If the ball hits the table first and then hits the defense, the player should pick the ball up and serve. If the ball bounces off of the defense onto the other side, that team must play the ball; the hand is treated like the paddle, and so defense can be considered a shot. If the one team hits the ball and it hits the other team's defense in the air, that will be considered a hit if it would have hit the cup were the defense not there. However, this is a difficult thing to ascertain. Ultimately, the team that shot the ball gets to make the decision of whether the shot is a Hit or not. However, the arguments of the bystanders and the other team should be listened to and respected. For this reason, playing defense can sometimes increase the risk both of the other team calling a hit and the ensuing arguments. Knock-overs and dunks If a team knocks over their own cup with the ball, their paddle, their body, or by hitting the table, they lose and must drink a beer. This is true regardless of how much beer was in the cup (or if it was empty). If a player hits a ball (not on the serve) and knocks over the other team's cup, his team automatically wins, regardless of how full the cup is. The Full Cup Knockover is considered the most difficult shot in the game. If a player hits the ball and it lands into the other team's beer, that player's side wins the game and the other team must chug their beers. This is called a Dunk. =Slam pong= A slam pong player Slam pong is a fast-moving variant of beer pong that retains some of the rules of table tennis but borrows inspiration from the rules and game play of volleyball. The \\"slam\\" in slam pong refers to the action of slamming a table tennis ball with a paddle into a plastic cup of beer placed on the table, the fundamental way of scoring points in the game. Slam pong was one of the forms of the game that evolved from the traditional beer pong of the late 1970s. Slam pong retained the use of just one beer cup per player, with two players per team, but added the twist that a legal volley required the ball to strike the paddles of both players on a team before striking the table or beer cups. One of the earliest documented record of slam pong comes from Chris Robinson, Dartmouth College class of 1986, who recalled playing slam pong when he was an undergraduate. An article in the March, 1986 issue of Playboy magazine describes slam pong being played by the brothers of Psi Upsilon at Dartmouth.Carroll, E. Jean (1986). \\"Young Men, Old Money\\" . Playboy, March, 1986. By the early 1990s, slam pong was played in nearly half of all Dartmouth College Greek organizations, and had been introduced to other colleges including Bowdoin College, Bucknell University, Cornell University, Lehigh University, Princeton University, and Williams College, but by the middle of the decade was beginning to decline in popularity. By the early 2000s, slam pong had been almost totally eclipsed by other variations of beer pong, especially Beirut, one of the first variations of beer pong to be widely played across the country. At Dartmouth, lob became the standard variation of beer pong played by undergraduates. Scoring Points are earned through hits, sinks, and knockovers. There are two primary variations for counting scoring and declaring the winner of a game. In the five-point game, hits count for one point, sinks count for two points, and knockovers count for five points.Phi Tau Coeducational Fraternity (1995). \\"Slam Pong\\" . Retrieved Nov. 7, 2005. In the five-point game, whenever a team earns points, both players of that team are expected to drink one fifth of the total volume of their cup for each point. In the four-point variation of the game, hits count for one point, sinks count for up to two points, and knockovers count for up to two points.O'Dell, Scott (2005). \\"Beer Game: Slam Pong\\". Retrieved Feb. 7, 2006. If a cup is half-full and gets sunk or knocked-over, that counts as only one point. Players in a four-point game are expected to drink half of a single cup for each point. A team cannot lose on a serve. If a team has only one point left, they cannot have the last point scored through their own ineptitude. However, if both teams have only a single point left, a team may \\"serve out\\" if others are waiting to play a subsequent game. In a five-point game, the first team to earn five points loses. In a four-point game, the first team to earn four points loses. Culture Concerns over binge drinking on college campuses have increased focus on games like beer pong and slam pong. Dartmouth College Anthropology Professor Hoyt Alverson published research work on the beer pong culture at Dartmouth in the early 2000s. Although slam pong had largely been replaced at Dartmouth and elsewhere by other forms of the beer pong game at that time, Alverson noted that the variations played from 1999 through 2002 involved complex social processes. \\"Beer pong and similar drinking games are not played solely to achieve inebriation, Alverson finds, but instead serve as a competitive outlet for high-achieving students, and a structured atmosphere for peer interaction.\\"Sheu, Kimberley (2005). \\"Anthropology Prof Studies Pong, Binge Drinking\\" . The Dartmouth. July 12, 2005. Critics of beer pong contend that, regardless of their social nature, the games encourage binge drinking, and should be discouraged.\\"Beer Pong Has Its Champions, Foes\\" . Ann Arbor News.

Early life and education Christian August Lorentzen was born in S√∏nderborg, Denmark. He was the son of Hans Peter Lorentzen and Maria Christina Hansdatter. His father was a watchmaker. He arrived in Copenhagen around 1771 where he frequented the Royal Academy of Fine Arts but it is unclear whether he received formal training.Thomas Kappel. After arriving in Copenhagen, he was soon used as a portrait painter. From 1779 to 1782 he went abroad to develop his skills, visiting the Netherlands, Antwerp and Paris where he copied old masters. In 1792 he traveled to Norway to paint prospects. Career C. A. Lorentzen in his studio by Martinus R√∏rbye, painted before 1828 After returning home in 1782, he became a more versatile artist. In a number of painting, such as Slaget p√• Reden (Battle of Copenhagen. 1801) at Danish Museum of National History and Den r√¶dsomste nat (The Awful Night. 1807) at Danish National Gallery, he documented key events from the English Wars between 1801 and 1814. Later in his career he mainly painted portraits, landscapes and scenes from the comedies of Ludvig Holberg (1684‚Äì1754). He was professor at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen from 1803 and until his death in 1828. He followed Nicolai Abildgaard (1743‚Äì1809) as the Academy Director from 1809‚Äì10. He exercised great influence on the next generation of painters such as Martinus R√∏rbye (1803‚Äì1848) among others.

All the stories had previously appeared in periodicals, usually The Strand Magazine in the United Kingdom and The Red Book Magazine or The Saturday Evening Post in the United States. It is a miscellaneous collection and includes several stories that are more serious than Wodehouse's more well-known comic fiction. Wodehouse biographer Richard Usborne stated that the collection was \\"mostly sentimental apprentice work\\", though one light-hearted story, \\"Extricating Young Gussie\\", is notable for the first appearance in print of two of Wodehouse's best-known characters, Jeeves and his master Bertie Wooster (although Bertie's surname is not given and Jeeves's role is very small), and Bertie's fearsome Aunt Agatha. In the US version of the book, \\"Wilton's Holiday\\", \\"Crowned Heads\\", and the two-part \\"The Mixer\\" were omitted, and replaced with three Reggie Pepper stories that had appeared in the UK collection My Man Jeeves (1919).

She is fond of him but wants to marry someone in her profession. Henry tries to get a job on the stage but fails since he cannot sing or dance. Henry is sent by his employer to follow the touring company performing The Girl from Brighton, which Alice is part of, since a woman wants her husband shadowed and he is an actor in the show. Henry follows the company from town to town, using different disguises. Though it bothers Henry not to be able to talk to Alice, he enjoys travel and admires the company's performers, including Sidney Crane, who plays the hero, and the company's star actor, amiable comedian Walter Jelliffe. Henry chats with Jelliffe in multiple towns in different disguises. Eventually, Jelliffe asks Henry who he is following. The company realized that Henry is a detective and call him Bill the Bloodhound. They are holding a sweepstake on who he is investigating. The show has been successful, so Jelliffe thinks Henry is lucky and asks him to join them as a mascot. Henry agrees, but refuses to reveal who he is following. During the next show, Henry proposes to Alice just before she goes on stage. He tries to follow her and trips onto the stage, delighting the crowd and interrupting a song by Clarice Weaver, who is unpopular in the company. Later, Jelliffe assures Henry that the company is glad about Henry's interruption, because it compelled Clarice Weaver to quit and Sidney Crane's wife will replace her as the show's heroine. Henry will soon have to go back to London (US version: New York), because he was hired by Mrs Crane. Jelliffe, who is glad he won the sweepstake, urges him to join the troupe. Jelliffe is certain that Henry will be a successful actor and mascot for the company because he is lucky. Henry gladly joins the company, and is now in the same profession as Alice. =\\"Extricating Young Gussie\\"= * US: The Saturday Evening Post, 18 September 1915 * UK: The Strand Magazine, January 1916 (source for this book) See \\"Extricating Young Gussie\\". =\\"Wilton's Holiday\\"= * UK: The Strand Magazine, July 1915 (source for this book, UK setting: Marvis Bay) * US: Illustrated Sunday Magazine and Minneapolis Tribune Sunday Magazine, 19 March 1916 (as \\"Wilton's Vacation\\", US setting: Rockport) ;Plot The story is narrated by a man from London (a man from New York in the US edition). Jack Wilton comes to Marois Bay to spend his holiday. There he invents a story about his fianc√©e, Amy, dying on their wedding day to prevent local people from confiding in him and from bothering him with their sad stories and problems.

When he tells her that he invented Amy, she decides to break with him for good. Upset about Mary, Jack goes for a walk on the seashore and ends up falling asleep against a rock in a secluded cove. When he wakes up, he finds that Mary is there, since she happened to do the same thing. When the tide rises, they are trapped and Mary fears they will drown. She confesses her love for Jack, but he tells her the tide won't get high enough to drown them, and she gets annoyed that he didn't tell her earlier. They sit apart from each other for a while waiting for the tide to recede. Eventually, Mary forgives him and they reconcile. =\\"The Mixer: He Meets a Shy Gentleman\\"= * UK: The Strand Magazine, November 1915 (as \\"The Mixer\\", source for this book, UK setting) * US: The Red Book Magazine, June 1916 (as \\"A Very Shy Gentleman\\", US setting) Maplewood Barn Radio (Missouri, US) has adapted some early Wodehouse stories for radio, including the two-part story \\"The Mixer\\" in 2015, as well as two other stories collected in The Man with Two Left Feet, \\"At Geisenheimer's\\" and \\"Extricating Young Gussie\\". ;Plot The narrator, the Mixer, is a dog with the face of a bulldog and the body of a terrier.

The restless dog is eager to see life and barks goodbye to his mother and others at the pub, including the friendly barman Fred. The furtive man who bought the dog keeps to himself, so the dog thinks he is shy and calls him the Shy Man. The man is only talkative on one occasion, when he tells an associate that the dog will help him enter unnoticed into a house that always keeps a guard dog. He is stern and hits the narrator when he barks, but rewards him when he learns not to bark. The dog thinks the man is too shy to stand being spoken to. Despite the times the man hit him, the dog grows attached to him and is sorry he is so shy. Some time later, the Shy Man brings the dog to a vacated country house being looked after by a caretaker. The caretaker's old guard dog died earlier that day because it was poisoned. The Shy Man sells the narrator to the caretaker to be the new guard dog. The dog is pleased to see Fred, who visits the caretaker, his father. That night, the Shy Man breaks into the house, and the dog, trained not to bark, keeps quiet. However, he pities the man's shyness, and wakes Fred up so Fred can see him and help him not be shy. Fred hears the intruder's footsteps and, armed with a gun, has the intruder arrested. The dog is confused about why the Shy Man is taken away, but Fred and his father treat him very well after the incident, so he decides not to worry about it. =\\"The Mixer: He Moves in Society\\"= * UK: The Strand Magazine, December 1915 (as \\"The Mixer\\", source for this book, UK setting) * US: The Red Book Magazine, July 1916 (as \\"Breaking into Society\\", US setting) ;Plot The narrator, the sociable dog who calls himself the Mixer, runs across the street and is hit by a car, though the car is was going slowly and he is not seriously hurt.

Katie is her grandfather's caretaker and is unwilling to upset him by marrying Ted. Ted's friend, a boxer, offers to pretend to threaten Mr. Bennett so Ted can defend Mr. Bennett and win his favour.

Miss Roxborough feels sorry for Mary and wants to help. The club holds a dancing contest, which is actually arranged so that Miss Roxborough's ticket number will be announced the winner, so that the management do not really have to give away the prize, the Love-r-ly Silver Cup. Miss Roxborough convinces Mary to enter the contest with a dance partner and gives Mary a ticket. Miss Roxborough dances with Charlie, who is focused on dancing and does not realize Mary is competing until the contest ends. Miss Roxborough's original number is announced the winner, but she gave her ticket to Mary, so Mary and her partner win. Charlie is stunned that Mary won. Miss Roxborough convinces him that Mary may become captivated by New York and leave him if they stay much longer, so he now wants to go back with Mary to Maine.

Henry tells the following story. Mr MacFarland is a widower with a reticent son named Andy. MacFarland also adopts Katie, the amiable daughter of a deceased friend. MacFarland started the restaurant (then called MacFarland's), which got off to a good start thanks to Henry and the skilled French cook Jules. Katie becomes cashier at the restaurant, while secretly taking dancing classes. Andy attends college but quits and takes over the restaurant after Mr MacFarland dies. At some point, Katie and Andy start dating, but Andy disapproves of her decision to go on the stage and ends things between them. She is successful, and brings friends from the theatre to MacFarland's. This leads to the restaurant becoming popular, though Andy is not grateful and still distant to Katie. The restaurant's employees work hard to maintain the restaurant's quality and popularity. Henry concludes that this is how Mac's became successful, but the original narrator wants to know what happened to Katie and Andy. Henry is like an uncle to Katie and sympathetic to her, and he is disappointed with Andy for being cold and ungrateful to her. On one occasion she starts dancing at the restaurant but Andy tells her to stop, and she stops coming to the restaurant. One evening, Henry finds a letter under his door from Katie, who has decided to kill herself by filling her room with gas. Henry is shocked and quickly goes to save her. He talks with her and she tells him she broke her ankle and will never be able to dance again. This was too much for her on top of losing Andy. Henry gets her to promise not to kill herself, and then brings her letter to Andy. Andy rushes to her side. Henry leaves them with Andy finally showing his affection and embracing her. =\\"One Touch of Nature\\"= * US: McClure's Magazine, August 1914 (as \\"Brother Fans\\") ;Plot A businessman from New York, J.

The second, Mr Johnson, is more reluctant, but is persuaded by Birdsey. At dinner, Waterall, who is from New York, believes that Johnson looks familiar, though Johnson denies knowing Waterall. Johnson used to live in New York, but has lived in Algiers for five years. Waterall mentions that he is the London correspondent of the New York Chronicle. Birdsey explains that his daughter married an earl, and he sneaked out of a big dinner party to attend the baseball game. Johnson says little about himself. Waterall realizes that Johnson is actually Mr Benyon, who robbed the New Asiatic Bank, jumped his bail, and fled five years ago. Waterall reported on his trial. Benyon admits he risked recognition to see the baseball game because he missed baseball and New York. Waterall telephones Scotland Yard to report Benyon's whereabouts, but Birdsey is moved by Benyon's love of baseball. He tackles Waterall so Benyon can escape.

The janitor of her apartment building remarks that black cats bring good luck. Elizabeth hopes so, since she is having trouble selling stories to magazines. She names the cat Joseph and values his company, especially because she has no friends. One day Joseph goes into the nearby flat belonging to James Renshaw Boyd. Elizabeth asks for her cat back. James pretends the cat is his, but she questions him further and he admits the cat is hers. He is superstitious and believes if he gives up the cat, the upcoming play he wrote, his first play, will fail. Elizabeth appreciates this and allows him to keep the cat. When she says she has no friends, James says she should take Joseph back, but Elizabeth insists James keep Joseph. Elizabeth grows close to James. She tells him about how a rich and unexpected aunt sent her to college, though James is reluctant to discuss his past. Elizabeth gets a job as an advice columnist. James is drained by difficult rehearsals, and in despair, he suddenly embraces Elizabeth. This shocks and upsets Elizabeth. She quickly returns to her own flat, and ignores the doorbell ringing. Two weeks later, the play opens, and receives very negative criticism. Elizabeth forgets her resentment. She loves James and is concerned for him. He is initially crushed, but Elizabeth comforts him. They agree to get married. Though James wanted to try being a playwright, his father is the rich owner of a pork company and James has a job waiting in Chicago. Elizabeth says she will go to Chicago with him. The cat goes into the flat of Paul Axworthy Briggs, and James advises Briggs to hold onto the cat, who brings luck in unexpected ways.

The road is too peaceful and gives him little opportunity to earn a promotion. However, he likes the road more when he falls in love with a girl who lives there, Ellen Brown. However, she is dating the handsome milkman, Alf Brooks. Plimmer, a big, red-faced man with a broken nose, is jealous of Brooks. Plimmer argues with Ellen when he sees her posting a letter to Brooks. In a sporting spirit, she retorts that he is jealous. She is stunned when Plimmer admits that he is. He looks her in the eyes and then leaves, restraining his emotions. Later, an elderly woman calls for Constable Plimmer. The woman, named Jane, tells Plimmer that her cook has stolen a brooch and some money. Jane's husband Henry admits he took the money since his wife controls his spending, but the cook, who turns out to be Ellen, admits to taking the brooch. She only wished to borrow it. Jane does not believe her, and Plimmer reluctantly escorts Ellen to the police station. While walking, they see Alf, who is waiting for Ellen. Since she is being arrested, Alf pretends not to recognize her. This devastates Ellen. Plimmer, seeing the look on her face, tells her to run after Alf and tell him it was all a joke. Plimmer will let her go, even if he is dismissed or sent to prison as a result. Ellen refuses to go to Alf after the way he ignored her, but is touched that Plimmer would have let her go and asks him why. He replies that he does not think she stole anything, and admits he loves her. Though Plimmer again tells her to go, she does not want him to get in trouble and insists that he take her to the station. Ellen expects to be in prison for thirty days. She tells Plimmer that she hopes he will be there waiting for her when she comes out, and he assures her he will be there if he has to sit up all night. The Ainslee's version of the story is significantly different. Some money is stolen but there is no mention of a brooch. Plimmer still says he will be there for Ellen when she comes out of prison, but Ellen is shown at the end to be innocent and does not go to prison. Plimmer asks her to marry him. =\\"A Sea of Troubles\\"= * US: McClure's Magazine, September 1914 (US setting) * UK: Pearson's Magazine, June 1915 (source for this book, UK setting) The story is titled \\"A Sea of Trouble\\" in the US edition of The Man with Two Left Feet. ;Plot Mr Meggs is fifty-six and rich. He was once a clerk in a shipping firm, but twenty years ago he received a large inheritance and retired to his native village. He has lived an idle, sedentary life and has indulged in rich food. One day he finds that he has chronic pains from indigestion. Patent medicines fail to help. The pain is bad enough that Meggs eventually decides to end his own life, but first, he plans to send money to his heirs. Though he would deny it, he enjoys choosing his heirs and writing them letters. Meggs is resolved not to leave a will and to send all his money directly to the beneficiaries. He prepares envelopes to send to six friends he worked with as a clerk. Each envelope contains a letter and money. He summons his secretary, Miss Jane Pillenger, an austere older woman who has worked for Meggs for six years. He has set aside a legacy of five hundred pounds for her. Meggs gives her the six letters to post, and then hands her the five hundred pounds. He tries to explain that he holds her in high regard and kisses her on the forehead. Pillenger thinks he is flirting with her and hits him. He tries to explain the misunderstanding, but she does not believe him. She resigns from her post and leaves the room. Meggs, indignant, feels people are ungrateful and that it would be absurd to kill himself and leave them money. Now determined not to commit suicide, he realizes Pillenger left with the six envelopes. He runs after her telling her to stop but she thinks he is dangerous and flees shouting for help. Several men come and grab Meggs. A policeman questions him. Meggs, who is winded from running, manages to explain that he only wanted the letters. The constable lets him go. Pillenger haughtily gives him the letters and departs. The next morning, Meggs feels unusually well. He realizes the exercise of running helped him, and plans to seek a fitness trainer in London. =\\"The Man with Two Left Feet\\"= * US: The Saturday Evening Post, 18 March 1916 * UK: The Strand Magazine, May 1916 (source for this book) ;Plot Henry Wallace Mills is a bank teller in New York. Henry spends his vacation at Ye Bonnie Briar-Bush Farm, where he meets Minnie Mill. She looks tired, and explains she has been dancing in the city. Henry is not a dancer and prefers to spend his free time reading the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but he is able to impress Minnie with his knowledge. They fall in love and get married. Their first year together is very happy, with Minnie often listening to him reading the Encyclopaedia aloud. The anniversary of their wedding comes, and they have supper at Geisenheimer's. Henry notices his former colleague Sidney Mercer there. Sidney is now a professional dancer at Geisenheimer's. Sidney notices Henry and Minnie aren't dancing. Henry admits he doesn't dance, and encourages Minnie to dance with Sidney. Henry thinks Minnie must find life with him dull, and resolves to learn to dance. He keeps this secret from her in order to surprise her on her birthday. He takes private dancing lessons, instructed by Madame Gavarni and her niece. Minnie seems to grow distant. Henry thinks she is bored, and looks forward to surprising her with dancing. On Minnie's birthday, he brings her to Geisenheimer's. Sidney asks Minnie to dance, but Henry declares he will dance with her. They dance, and Henry, unused to dancing in a crowd, ends up hitting other dancers and embarrassing himself. Henry and Minnie return to their flat, and he apologizes to her. He explains that he took dancing lessons secretly to make things less dull for her. She is thrilled to hear this, because she had seen Henry with Madame Gavarni's niece and had misunderstood. She assures Henry she does not find their life dull. In fact, she was tired when she met Henry because she was a dancing instructor and hated it. She truly enjoys listening to him read, and asks him to read her something out of the Encyclopaedia, which he gladly does.

It was once home to the Central Flying School, the Vintage Pair and the Red Arrows. Built during the 1930s, the station was opened in 1938 and closed in 1994. The married-quarters and main technical site were sold in 1996 (the former becoming the village of Upper Rissington). RAF Little Rissington has been retained by the Ministry of Defence and is known as RAF Little Rissington Airfield. It remains active along with the southern technical sites, under the operational control of HQ No. 2 Flying Training School RAF at RAF Syerston. It is now home to 621 Volunteer Gliding Squadron RAF and 637 Volunteer Gliding Squadron RAF as the primary military units, providing elementary flying training for Combined Cadet Force and Air Training Corps cadets. The airfield is also used by the forces as a relief landing ground, training area and parachute dropping area. In previous years, the Royal Air Force estate has been used as a film set, including The Avengers, part of the ice chase in Die Another Day, and the Thunderbirds film. In March 2015 a new hangar is being built on the airfield. In 2017 investment was made in upgrading facilities for the RAF Air Cadets. The old fire station was upgraded to provide modern teaching facilities and an accommodation block with canteen was built next door. The new hangar is now operational for the storage and maintenance of the gliders. The airfield has had major groundworks on the grassed area creating a grassed runway. History Folland Gnat advanced trainer of the RAF Central Flying School at Little Rissington in 1967 RAF Little Rissington Aerodrome 2006 637VGS Fleet 2006 CFS Watch Tower behind the Aerodrome Identifier =The beginning: 1930s into war= During the build-up to the Second World War, the Air Ministry began constructing major airfields across the United Kingdom under what was known as the Expansion Period. RAF Little Rissington was one of these airfields. RAF Little Rissington officially opened in 1938, comprising the domestic site and a grass airfield. During 1942, three asphalt runways were laid. Extra land was added to accommodate Sites A to E. Later in the war, the main runway 05/23 was extended northerly (later to become the main runway for instrument landings), 09/27 and 14/32 were extended easterly and south-easterly respectively. Up to 1945 the station accommodated No. 6 Service Flying Training School RAF and No. 8 Maintenance Unit RAF. No. 8 Maintenance Unit was originally designated No. 8 Aircraft Storage Unit (ASU), however as the Second World War increased its momentum, so did the number of aircraft being stored. During the mid-1940s dispersal areas began openly storing aircraft, that had arrived straight from the manufacture. Due to security concerns, the level of security protection stepped up during the war, including the Station's own fighter force of several Spitfires. Later in the war, various satellite airfields were used to spread out the increased number of aircraft. =Central Flying School: 1946 to 1976= In 1946 the Royal Air Force Central Flying School (CFS) moved to Little Rissington. The airfield also became the home to the RAF's aerobatics teams which included the Red Pelicans and later the Red Arrows. The airfield was expanded during this period, and a new fire station and control tower were built. The Little Rissington UFO incident took place in October 1952. =Imjin Barracks: 1977 to 1979= After CFS's departure, the airfield was used by the Army, and with the arrival of the Royal Irish Rangers, Little Rissington became \\"Imjin Barracks\\". =USAFE at RAF Little Rissington: 1981 to 1993= With the arrival of the United States Air Forces in Europe, Little Rissington became the largest military contingency hospital in Europe. The aerodrome was cleared for C-130 Hercules and C-5 Galaxies. During the Gulf War, Little Rissington was held on its highest readiness state for several decades as it prepared for casualties. The USAF left Little Rissington in 1993 and it was handed back to the Royal Air Force. =The draw down: 1994 to 2005= Little Rissington was identified as surplus to requirements in the Government's \\"Options for Change\\" package and the entire site was put up for sale. The domestic and main technical sites of the station were sold to a property developer and became a business park. =Revival: 2006 to 2010= Following a Defence Review, the planned disposal of RAF Little Rissington was stopped, and so the immediate future of the aerodrome was secured. Several buildings received some minor upgrades. At the end of 2006, a civilian aircraft maintenance firm called 'Devonair' moved in under an agreement with the Ministry of Defence until 2012. In 2008, RAF Little Rissington was designated a Core Site up to 2030, under the Defence Estates Development Plan 2008. While nothing has yet been confirmed, RAF Little Rissington has been looked at to support various changes: * Satellite for RAF Brize Norton in supporting the Future Brize Project (formerly Project CATARA) with C130 Hercules training and maintenance. * Satellite for RAF Benson, to provide a relief landing ground for helicopter training, and potentially relief storage pending the future decision on the Lyneham estate. In 2011 the airfield was identified as a site with \\"localised radium contaminated soil\\" from the scrapping of surplus equipment after World War II. At the end of 2011, the Upper Rissington Business Park owner Reland commenced the demolition of the main technical site. This demolition forms part of their future plans are to turn the technical site and former married quarters into an eco-town. During 2014 to 2015, the four prominent Type-C Hangars were demolished and major housing construction carried out. =Present= In 2014, real estate development commenced on the airfield by the Royal Air Force to facilitate a centralised flying training strategy by No. 2 Flying Training School. This included a conversion of the fire station into an Operations Centre and the building of a new hangar / maintenance facility on the main dispersal. Planning permission was approved by the Cotswold District Council in July 2015 for the construction of an Aircrew Mess where the former control tower was originally located. In 2016, the RAF Ceremonial approved a station badge as no formal badge ever existed for RAF Little Rissington. This badge adopted the 22 (Training) Group badge and motto. The airfield, RAF Little Rissington, continues to remains active and regularly used for elementary flying training, air drops, aircraft maintenance, and ground training. Rumours of an underground hospital It is a local belief that a nuclear- proof underground hospital built by the United States Air Force lies underneath RAF Little Rissington. This rumour has, however, never been verified. However, it was widely accepted at the time that tunnels were dug during the Second World War, ostensibly for the Royal Observer Corps, a frequently adopted strategy used to disguise covert electronic warfare establishments. Whether this tunnel network was developed during the 1980s is unknown. A bunker is attached to the Sick Ward/Medical Centre at the main technical site. It is commonly mistaken for the rumoured underground USAF(E) hospital. The ward/bunker is covered in earth for protection and to remove the need to move patients during air raids. It dates back to the station's construction in the 1930s. Consequently, it is above the surface and it is not nuclear-proof. This bunker was demolished, along with many other unused structures, in December 2011 as part of the site owners' \\"progress\\" toward converting the site into a housing estate. Historic monuments RAF Little Rissington is one of several MoD estates with a scheduled monument. It is a Neolithic long barrow dating from between 3400 and 2400 BC on the eastern side of the airfield. It is long, up to wide and up to high. It had a stone-lined passage about long, starting at its northeast end and ending in a small burial chamber. The barrow was partly excavated in 1934. During the Second World War the Air Ministry built a large air-raid shelter into it to protect the service personnel working in the maintenance units. Under the MoD's obligation to preserve and protect the UK's ancient monuments on their estates, this particular monument has in recent years been subject to several inspections by Defence Estates.

These range from his fellow students at school to monsters and aliens from Calvin's vivid imagination. Calvin's family Watterson has never given Calvin's parents' names \\"because as far as the strip is concerned, they are important only as Calvin's mom and dad.\\" Like Hobbes, they serve as counterpoints to Calvin's attitude and view of the world. However, Watterson sometimes uses them to explore situations adults can relate to, such as the desire to enjoy leisure time as opposed to the need to work, or bad customer service and frustrations when grocery shopping. Also, occasionally Watterson takes the time to flesh out the two parental characters. One example is a storyline in which the family returns from a wedding to find their house has been broken into and ransacked. For several strips, Calvin and Hobbes fade into the background as Mom and Dad reflect on the impact of the event. Calvin's father is a white-collar office worker, specifically a patent attorney, as Watterson's own father was. An outdoorsman, he enjoys bike rides and camping trips, sometimes in extreme weather and insists that these activities, like Calvin's chores, \\"build character\\". Though his age is never specified, when Calvin offers him a bowl of chocolate cereal, he replies \\"No thanks, I'm trying to reach middle age.\\" In a rare instance where Calvin and Hobbes are pushed into the background of a story arc, Calvin's father is particularly shaken when the house is robbed. As he admits to his wife, \\"I don't think I'd have been in such a hurry to reach adulthood if I'd known the whole thing was going to be ad-libbed.\\"Calvin and Hobbes - The Revenge of the Baby-Sat, p. 70. Calvin's mother is a stay-at-home mom who is frequently exasperated by Calvin's antics. Before Calvin's birth, she worked a stressful job filled with aggravation, which Calvin's father claims is the reason she was better prepared to stay at home and raise Calvin. Whether or not he was jesting is debatable. On the rare occasions when she is not reacting to Calvin's misbehavior, she seems to enjoy quiet activities, such as gardening and reading. She is frequently the one forced to curb Calvin's destructive tendencies; in one Sunday strip, she allows Calvin to smoke a cigarette in order to teach him how unpleasant smoking can be. (Watterson has said he regrets the fact that the strip mostly shows her impatient side.) In another strip, she voices a wish that Calvin will one day have a child like himself, so he can understand what he puts her through, and Calvin retorts that her own mother used to say the same thing about her. She also usually seems sympathetic towards her son's relationship with Hobbes, and a few times has found herself speaking to Hobbes as well, though this embarrasses her. Early on in the strip, Watterson says, they were criticized by readers for being overly sarcastic and insufficiently patient, especially Calvin's father, who has several times reminded his wife that he at first wanted a dachshund instead of a son. =Other relatives= Uncle Max Calvin's Uncle Max appeared in a series of strips in 1988, visiting the family. Uncle Max is Calvin's father's \\"big brother\\", though he is established as single and childless. When Calvin (who first suspected he was a con man trying to swindle them) guesses that Max was in jail (to explain why he hasn't met Max), his mother is outraged, while his father seems to agree with Calvin, saying \\"with Max, that's not a bad guess\\". Watterson has said Uncle Max was meant to be included in further strips, such as where the family would go to Max's home to pay him a visit; he never appeared again because Watterson felt that it was strange for Max to be unable to refer to the parents with proper names, and that the character never provided the new material for Calvin that he had hoped for.Calvin and Hobbes Tenth Anniversary Book, by Bill Watterson. (paperback) (hardback) Max is drawn to resemble Calvin's dad, but with a moustache instead of glasses. The two are modeled after Watterson, who wore both. Grandparents A few strips mention Calvin's grandparents. One example, which Watterson selected for reproduction in the Tenth Anniversary Book, features Calvin telling Hobbes describing his Grandfather's complaints about comic strips: newspapers print them too small, and now they look like Xeroxed talking heads. Hobbes then tells Calvin that his grandfather takes comic strips seriously; Calvin says as a result, his mother is looking into nursing homes. Susie Derkins Susie Derkins is a classmate of Calvin who lives in his neighborhood. She is the only recurring character in the comic strip to have both a forename and a surname revealed (other characters are mentioned briefly). Named after Watterson's in-laws' family beagle, she first appeared early in the strip as a new student in Calvin's class, but in later strips speaks as a longtime neighbor. In contrast to Calvin, she is polite and diligent in her studies, and her imagination usually seems mild-mannered and civilized, consisting of games such as playing \\"house\\" or having tea parties with her stuffed animals. Her parents are referred to several times in the strip, but have not appeared other than one brief shot of her mother's legs while talking to Calvin. Susie is frequently the victim of Calvin's derision and plots, and is also often willing to retaliate when provoked. Most commonly, Susie will be the target of Calvin's water balloons or snowballs. Calvin often goes to great lengths to disgust or annoy Susie, as when founding his and Hobbes' club 'G.R.O.S.S.' (Get Rid Of Slimy GirlS) purposely to oppose her. Susie is Calvin's equal (and often superior) in cunning, often turning his plans into ignominious defeats. The two sometimes speak at their bus stop, where both become exasperated by their conversation; and at the lunch table, where Calvin recites disgusting descriptions of what his lunch contains. Elsewhere, Susie becomes frightened that Calvin's irresponsibility shall threaten her post-secondary education, or argues in academia's favor against him. Watterson has said he suspects that Calvin and Susie may have a crush on each other, and that \\"this encourages Calvin to annoy her\\". This love/hate relationship is most obvious in a Valentine's Day strip in which Susie seems to appreciate \\"a hate mail valentine and a bunch of dead flowers\\", and Calvin rejoices inwardly when she retaliates. In another strip, Calvin calls Susie for help with homework, and she teases him that he missed \\"the melodious sound of [her] voice\\". During one series of strips Calvin modifies his \\"duplicator\\" to copy only his good side; this well-dressed, polite, and very-intelligent version of Calvin soon becomes besotted with Susie, and is mystified by her hostile reaction. =Mr. Bun= Mr. Bun is Susie's stuffed rabbit, which frequents her tea parties as a guest. Unlike Hobbes, Mr. Bun is never shown as a living character, and Hobbes once described Mr. Bun as \\"comatose\\". This is used for comedic effect occasionally, as when Susie, playing \\"House\\" with Calvin, attempts to use Mr. Bun as their baby child, only to have Calvin refuse to recognize him as a human infant‚Äîwith the entire strip, including the rabbit, drawn in a realistic style √† la Rex Morgan, M.D.. Miss Wormwood Miss Wormwood is Calvin's schoolteacher. Watterson commented that a few astute fans of the strip have correctly asked him if Miss Wormwood was named after the apprentice demon in C. S. Lewis' The Screwtape Letters. She usually wears polka-dotted dresses, and serves as a foil to Calvin's mischief. Despite the changing seasons and recurring holidays, the characters in Calvin and Hobbes do not age, and so Calvin and Susie return to Miss Wormwood's first-grade class every fall. Miss Wormwood is rarely sympathetic to the trouble Calvin has in school, and comes across as a rather strict, sour character. She often calls on Calvin to answer questions, to catch him off guard, to which Calvin either replies with an excuse (\\"Hard to say, Ma'am. I think my cerebellum just fused.\\"), or takes solace in the world of Spaceman Spiff or another alter ego. She is quick to send Calvin to the principal's office at the first sign of trouble. Calvin apparently takes joy in being the reason why Miss Wormwood mixes different stress-related medications (she \\"drinks Maalox straight from the bottle\\") and self-medications (\\"Rumor has it she's up to two packs a day, unfiltered.\\" he remarks gleefully on the playground swings, after reminding her that she can't make him care about any of the material she presents). Calvin's antics leave Miss Wormwood anxious for retirement (one strip has her chanting in her head, \\"Five years until retirement, five years until retirement, five years until retirement...\\"). Regarding the difficulties of reining in rambunctious students, she once commented that \\"it's not enough that we have to be disciplinarians. Now we need to be psychologists.\\" Moe Moe is a bully in Calvin's school. His frequently monosyllabic dialogue is shown in crude, lower-case letters. Watterson describes Moe as \\"every jerk I've ever known\\". Moe is the only minor character in the strip who hurts Calvin without being provoked, and is also the only significant character never portrayed sympathetically. Stephan Pastis of the 2000s comic Pearls Before Swine has cited Watterson and Calvin and Hobbes as among his many influences; in particular, the Zeeba Zeeba Eata fraternity of crocodiles is identified with Moe, even speaking in the same typeface. Rosalyn Rosalyn, the last of the significant recurring characters to appear, is a high school senior and the only babysitter able to tolerate Calvin's antics. Rosalyn is perhaps the only character in the strip whom Calvin really fears (other than Moe, the school bully). Introduced in an early strip, Watterson found her ferocity and intimidation of Calvin surprising, and he brought her back periodically in increasingly elaborate story-lines. Watterson described their relationship as \\"one-dimensional\\", although in her final appearance Rosalyn agrees to play a game of Calvinball, and in so doing, becoming the only character in the strip, other than Hobbes, to truly engage with Calvin on his own terms. Calvin is often terrified of her, calling her a \\"sadistic kid- hater\\" and a \\"barracuda in a high-school-senior suit\\"; but in the final Rosalyn story, their opposition is averted by a game of Calvinball, which Rosalyn wins. In nearly all the \\"Rosalyn stories\\", Rosalyn is shown demanding advance payment and raises in wage from Calvin's parents, supposedly to pay for college or for the hard work necessary to control Calvin. (For the same reason, she briefly appears as Calvin's swimming instructor.) In at least four stories, Rosalyn telephones her boyfriend, Charlie, to cancel prearranged meetings which she cannot fulfill. (Charlie remains an unseen character.) Calvin sometimes urges Charlie to stop courting Rosalyn, on grounds that Rosalyn is sadistic and/or insane. The collection Revenge of the Baby-Sat took its name from a storyline in which Calvin steals her study notes and threatens to flush them down the toilet bowl. Rosalyn's demands for higher pay to baby- sit Calvin have often been met with a small discussion between his parents. In one skit the mother tells her husband, \\"Pay whatever it takes to get us out of here for the night.\\" In the last cell of the Revenge of the Baby-Sat storyline, after paying her and looking into his now empty wallet, the father says, \\"Are you sure there's nobody else in this town willing to babysit Calvin?\\" To which the mother says, \\"Maybe you would like to spend a week on the phone?\\" Other characters The cast of principal, recurring characters in Calvin and Hobbes is limited; for example, in the Yukon Ho! collection, only five regular characters appear. Other characters who make infrequent or one-off appearances include the following. *Living food: Calvin often imagines that an oatmeal-like food comes to life, sometimes attacking him (or, in one case, reciting Hamlet's \\"To be, or not to be\\" soliloquy). Bill Watterson has said that his inspiration for this came from a cartoon drawn by himself in childhood, which featured living oatmeal. *Extraterrestrial life forms: Calvin encounters many extraterrestrial life-forms in the course of the strip, usually during adventures as his alter-ego, Spaceman Spiff. Most of these aliens are non-humanoid, bizarre monsters, but represent Calvin's imaginative perception of Susie, his parents, and teachers. During the story which gave the name to the Weirdos from Another Planet! collection, Calvin and Hobbes encounter a native Martian, who is a small creature with tentacles and eye- stalks. In the strip's final year, Watterson drew two stories involving recurring alien characters, Galaxoid and Nebular, to whom Calvin \\"sold\\" the Earth for 50 alien leaves to use for his science project, which he failed when his teacher rejected the leaves' origin. The donors returned in the final two weeks of strips, angry at Calvin for failing to reveal the changing seasons; but were placated when Hobbes clad them in Christmas stockings. *Doctor: Calvin occasionally visits his pediatrician, who appears to be a mild-mannered physician with a friendly demeanor. Calvin, however, sees him as a vicious, sadistic interrogator, sometimes imagining him as an alien or overreacting to playful diagnoses. The doctor made his final appearance when he diagnosed Calvin with chicken pox; he comments on the ability of a virus to \\"take the edge off a kid\\", as the illness has left Calvin without the energy to put up a fight. *Principal Spittle: Calvin's school principal usually makes his appearance when Calvin has upset Miss Wormwood; typically, he is seen looking over his desk as Calvin tries to explain his latest mishap, with an apathetic or infuriated expression in his face. He is seldom shown speaking except in his first appearance. He is depicted thinking to himself that he hates his job. *Mr. Lockjaw: Mr. Lockjaw is the gym teacher and coach of the baseball team at Calvin's school. He is a squat, burly man with little patience, and no sympathy for Calvin whenever Moe gets violent with him in gym class, with Calvin commenting that Lockjaw thinks \\"violence is aerobic.\\" When Calvin leaves the baseball team, Lockjaw calls him a \\"quitter\\", and this emotional trauma leads to the reader's first encounter with Calvinball. *Scouts: Early in the strip, Watterson shows Calvin participating with other children in Cub Scout activities in the woods. Watterson thought at the time that Scouting might offer some potential for interesting adventures, but eventually abandoned the idea, considering it uncharacteristic of Calvin to join an organization, and viewing it as a distraction. *Susie's mom: She is shown from the waist down in a foiled attempt to pester Susie, and is also seen having a brief dialogue during Susie's first experience with Calvin's alter-ego, Stupendous Man. https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1994/02/16 https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBO_ZksU0AAq4VF.jpg *Substitute teachers: Occasionally, Calvin's class will have a substitute teacher. Only one, Mr. Kneecapper, was named, Calvin uses him as a reference for a prank he plays on Susie suggesting that the cafeteria meatloaf is made out of rowdy students. https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1995/05/30 In one set of strips, an unnamed woman is substituting; she looks through some notes Calvin's teacher left and inquires which child Calvin is. Later, Hobbes asks Calvin what he thought of her, Calvin replies he is unsure as \\"she went home at noon.\\" https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/04/14https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1987/04/15 *The monsters under the bed: the primary villains of the comic strip, along with Moe: a set of bizarre-looking photophobic characters, who live under Calvin's bed and periodically plan to eat Calvin, but are outwitted by him on each occasion. One of them was named Maurice, and another one is named Winslow. *Calvin's bicycle: A supporting villain, it will frequently chase (and even sometimes run over) Calvin, destroying household items or injuring Calvin himself. *Other Students: Calvin's classmates, like his teacher, are assumed to be the same every year as no time appears to pass in the comic strip. Some of the students who do have names are - Tommy Chestnutt, whom Calvin claims Hobbes ate when he made fun of him https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1985/12/16, Filthy Rich, who Calvin claims some bullies got by grabbing him at the drinking fountain https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1994/01/11, Candace, who has the desk nearest Susie, https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1993/03/03 Ronald, whom Calvin uses as the butt of his \\"invisible Cretinizer\\" joke, https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/03/15 Jessica ,whom in one story arc Susie passes gossip notes to via Calvin https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/01/14, and another student named Tommy whom Calvin claims squirted milk out his nose while telling a funny story. https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1991/08/06. Most of these are only mentioned by name in conversation. Apart from Candace and Ronald, those who do physically appear in the strip remain unnamed. This includes Calvin's baseball teammates, who bully him off the team when he makes a rookie mistake, and kids on the playground who usually are antagonistic to Calvin as well.

Individual standards =Operational Data Model (ODM)= The CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM) is designed to facilitate the regulatory- compliant acquisition, archive and interchange of metadata and data for clinical research studies. ODM is a vendor-neutral, platform-independent format for interchange and archive of clinical study data. The model includes the clinical data along with its associated metadata, administrative data, reference data and audit information. ODM was first introduced in 1999, and the latest version, 1.3.2, was released in 2012. ODM extensions have been developed to create a number of additional CDISC standards, including Define- XML, Dataset-XML, SDM-XML, and CTR-XML and future planned standard Protocol- XML. ODM is an XML based standard and it is an XML schema that provides number of constructs for modeling electronic Case Report Forms (CRFs). ODM is often combined with Study Data Model standard to more fully model trial arms or trial activities. ODM is also used in sending forms data from a clinical trial system to an electronic health record (EHR) system. =Define-XML= Define- XML supports the interchange of dataset metadata for clinical research applications in a machine-readable format. An important use case for Define- XML is to support the submission of clinical trials data in CDISC SDTM, SEND or ADaM format to regulatory authorities. The key metadata components to support submissions are: * Dataset definition * Dataset variable definitions * Controlled Terminology definitions * Value list definitions * Links to supporting documents * Computational method definitions * Comments definitions Define-XML can also be used to describe proprietary, non-CDISC dataset structures. The Define-XML model is implemented using extensions to the CDISC Operational Data Model (ODM) XML schema. The current version is 2.0 published on the CDISC web site. =CTR-XML= Clinical Trial Representation allows representing basic characteristic of a clinical trial, such as study sponsor, study name, size of the trial (number of participants). The standard was first introduced in 2016. BRIDG CDISC BRIDG model is a unifying model of the domain of clinical research and research studies. It defines basic elements such as investigator, subject, study, intervention. It is used to keep all standards consistent. It was first introduced in 2006 with version 2 released in 2008. It can be obtained as UML model as well as .OWL format. SHARE CDISC SHARE (Shared Health and Clinical Research Electronic Library) is a metadata repository that supports the development, governance, publishing, and consumption of CDISC standards in human and machine-readable formats. SHARE helps users find, understand, and use rich metadata (i.e., research concepts, data elements and attributes, relationship among data elements, properties in relationship, and controlled terminologies) relevant to clinical studies more efficiently and consistently. With all these information in a single repository, SHARE will improve integration and traceability of clinical data end-to-end, from protocol through analysis. SHARE will provide a collaborative standards development environment that will improve quality, integration, and consistency across CDISC standards. CDISC-registered solutions providers CDISC maintains a list of solutions providers, subject matter experts and consultants deemed to have sufficient knowledge and experience implementing the various CDISC standards. ODM and EDC integration Electronic data capture (EDC) systems can be certified as compliant with the Operational Data Model (ODM) by CDISC. There are two main types of integration, ODM Import and ODM Export. =ODM import= Full import allows importing of ODM-formatted clinical data (MetaData and Data). MetaData only import allows only the importing of MetaData. This is useful for setting up the EDC system to capture data. Basically allows third party software to define the forms, variables etc. used in the EDC system. This provides an EDC vendor-neutral system for defining a study. =ODM export= The EDC system will generate ODM data files for further processing. For example, REDCap data capture system allows export of a study in ODM.

Gann based on his 1944 novel Island in the Sky, directed by William A. Wellman, and starring and co-produced by John Wayne. It was released by Warner Bros. Due to its realism depicting the events surrounding an actual aircraft crash, it is considered one of the \\"classic\\" aviation films.Hardwick and Schnepf 1989, p. 66. Unlike most Wayne movies, the picture is an ensemble piece, also featuring Andy Devine, Lloyd Nolan, James Arness, and Paul Fix.  Plot  The film follows a pilot and crew of a World War II-era Douglas C-47 Skytrain (the military version of the DC-3) who try to survive after a forced emergency landing in the uncharted wildlands near the Quebec‚ÄìLabrador border. The pilot, Dooley (John Wayne), is a former airline pilot, who, like many others, was pressed into duty hauling war supplies across the northern route to England. Icy conditions force the aircraft to land, and with the difficulties of navigating far from settled country, they can provide only an approximate position to rescuers. After finding a frozen lake for a landing field, Dooley must keep his men alive while waiting for rescue in the extreme winter cold with temperatures plummeting to . Meanwhile, at Air Transport Headquarters, Col. Fuller (Walter Abel) gathers fellow airmen (played by Lloyd Nolan, James Arness, Andy Devine, and Paul Fix), who are determined to find the downed crew before hunger and the winter cold do them in. Wellman provides internal narrative for the stoic characters.

Production  Douglas C-47, a type featured in the film The script was based on a true story about a flight on 3 February 1943, although, unlike the story of the film, the co-pilot did not die. In his autobiography Fate Is the Hunter ‚Äî on which the movie of the same name is very loosely based ‚Äî Gann related the true story and his role as one of the search pilots while serving with Air Transport Command at Presque Isle Airfield, Maine. Gann had been scheduled to fly the mission that ran into trouble, but was bumped off the flight by a more senior pilot. The rights to the story were originally bought in January 1950 by Robert Stillman Productions, and Gann planned to write the screenplay with Seton I. Miller. Frank Rosenberg was scheduled to produce the film, which would star Richard Widmark. When Stillman dropped the film, the rights were picked up in December 1952 by Wayne-Fellows Productions, the partnership of John Wayne and Robert Fellows, as their third of seven eventual productions ‚Äî including, a year later, another Gann story, The High and the Mighty, in which Wayne also co- starred. The two movies shared many of the same production staff and crew members, including director William Wellman. Wellman had been a pilot with the Lafayette Flying Corps during World War I, where he earned the nickname \\"Wild Bill,\\" and with the United States Army Air Service after the war. He was a veteran aviation movie director whose Wings won the first-ever Academy Award (1927‚Äì1928). Wellman provided the voice-over narration that begins the film, and his two sons, Tim and Mike, who were eleven and five at the time, played the parts of Andy Devine's sons. It is notable that the women in the film, Ann Doran, Dawn Bender and Phyllis Winger, appear only in brief flashbacks or, in Doran's case, in a telephone conversation. The lack of a romantic interest was noted by critics who considered the film a more authentic and gritty drama compared to the usual Hollywood war movie. Wellman, who generally was not well liked by actors and actresses ‚Äî a feeling that he reciprocated ‚Äî was known to prefer to work with men, and many of his films are set in all-male (or nearly all-male) worlds.\\"William Wellman bio.\\" IMDb.com.

Instead, his portrayal of the downed aircraft's captain had been noted as believable and realistic. A strong ensemble cast of mainly studio B-actors actually contained a number of future stars, including Fess Parker, James Arness, Darryl Hickman and Mike Connors, who all went on to television fame. The film involves many realistic details, such as an ice pick kept conveniently embedded in a barracks wall so pilots can break the ice sheet on their morning wash water. The black-and-white cinematography by Archie Stout (dramatic scenes) and William H. Clothier (flying scenes) has been praised by critics. Production began in late January 1953 and was completed on 2 March. Filming took place partly at Donner Lake, near Truckee, California in the Sierra Nevada range.Ricci and Zmijewsky 1970, p. 190. The California Department of Forestry cut down trees in that area to make aircraft runways in the four-foot deep snow. Some background shooting also took place in San Francisco.

Both films are also two of the early John Wayne co- productions that starred Wayne. This production practice would not become widespread until the 1980s and 1990s, when stars from Robert Redford to Sandra Bullock took control of productions. Both films were aviation dramas and shared many of the same crew members and production staff. Along with Wayne, six actors appeared in both films: Regis Toomey, Paul Fix, Carl \\"Alfalfa\\" Switzer, Ann Doran, George Chandler and Michael Wellman (the director's son). Ernest K. Gann, the author of the books on which both films were based, also wrote the two screenplays.  Release and re-release  Island in the Sky premiered in Los Angeles on 3 September 1953, and went into general release two days later. The premiere apparently featured the use of stereophonic sound, as an intermission had to be inserted because of problems with it. Both Island in the Sky and The High and the Mighty were out of circulation for about 20 years due to legal issues. They were restored, returned to television in July 2005 and released as special edition DVDs that August.

Due to a curse, they were forced to undergo multiple births as mortals who would be subsequently killed by various avatars of Vishnu. They were incarnated as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha in Satya Yuga, Ravana and Kumbhakarna in Treta Yuga, and finally Shishupala and Dantavakra in Dvapara Yuga.  Genealogy  According to the Brahmanda Purana, Jaya and Vijaya were the sons of Kali (not the Hindu Goddess Kali), and Kali in turn was one of the sons of Varuna and his wife, Stuta (Sanskrit (‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•Å‡§§, meaning 'praise'). The brother of Kali (and uncle of Jaya and Vijaya) was Vaidya. Curse of the four Kumaras Gate keepers of Vaikunda prevent the saints from entering and they were cursed. Vishnu is rushing to the spot According to a story from Bhagavata Purana, the Four Kumaras, Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana, and Sanatkumara who are the manasputras of Brahma (sons born from the mind or thought power of Brahma), visited Vaikuntha, the abode of Vishnu, to see him. Due to the strength of their tapas, the four Kumaras appear to be mere children, though they are of great age. Jaya and Vijaya, the gatekeepers of the Vaikuntha interrupt the Kumaras at the gate, thinking them to be children. They also tell the Kumaras that Sri Vishnu is resting and that they cannot see him now. The enraged Kumaras replied Jaya and Vijaya that Vishnu is available for his devotees any time, and cursed both the keepers Jaya and Vijaya, that they would have to give up their divinity, be born as mortals on bhooloka (earth, or physical plane), and live like normal human beings. Vishnu appeared before them, and the gatekeepers requested Vishnu to lift the curse of the Kumaras. Vishnu said that the curse of the Kumaras cannot be reversed. Instead, he gives Jaya and Vijaya two options. The first option is to take seven births on Earth as a devotee of Vishnu, while the second is to take three births as his enemy. After serving either of these sentences, they can re-attain their stature at Vaikuntha and be with him permanently. Jaya and Vijaya cannot bear the thought of staying away from Vishnu for seven lives. As a result, they choose to be born three times on earth even though it would have to be as enemies of Vishnu. In their first life during Satya Yuga, they were born as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha to Diti (daughter of Daksha Prajapati) and sage Kashyapa, and were killed by Varaha (boar avatar) and Narasimha (man-lion avatar). In their second life during the Treta Yuga, they were born as Ravana and Kumbhakarna, and were killed by Rama. In their third life during Dwapara Yuga, they were born as Dantavakra and Shishupala, and were killed by Krishna. It has been noted by many that the strengths of Jaya and Vijaya gradually declined with each subsequent birth. Vishnu needed one avatar each to kill Hiranyaksha and Hiranyakashipu. Born as Rama, he was able to vanquish both Ravana and Kumbhakarna. In the Krishna avatar, the killing of Dantavakra, Shishupala and Kamsa is not the main focus but more to reduce the 'Bhoobhara\\" (the burden on Mother earth due to too many sinners). Door-keepers of Vishnu temples Statue of Vijaya at the entrance of the Jagannath Temple, Puri In the modern era, known in Sanskrit as the Kali Yuga, Jaya and Vijaya are free from their curse, and they can be seen as gatekeepers in Vishnu temples and temples affiliated with Vaishnavism. Statues of Jaya-Vijaya stand in the temple of Venkateswara in Tirumala, the temple of Jagannath in Puri, and the temple of Ranganatha in Srirangam.

During this time period, any positive reinforcement is revoked and other privileges are often also taken away, such as using the Internet, playing video games or watching television. The punishment may include having to do extra chores as well. Grounding is used as an alternative to physical discipline, e.g., spanking, for behavior management in the home. According to a 2000 review on child outcomes, \\"Grounding has been replicated as a more effective disciplinary alternative than spanking with teenagers.\\" Grounding can backfire if the type and duration of restrictions are disproportionately severe for the behavior meant to be corrected, or if the restrictions are too difficult for the parent to enforce.

It is located around south of the town of Flitwick.Grid reference Finder measurement tools The River Flit flows behind the Westoning stud farm.Ordnance survey website History =Dark and Middle Ages= ;1086 The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086; men in the village (as heads of household or serfs) numbered 16 villagers (villeins), 3 smallholders and 4 slaves (serfs). Cultivated land amounted to 14 ploughlands (land for) two lord's plough teams, five men's plough teams. Other resources were 2.0 ploughs of lord's lands (private parkland), seven ploughs of meadow and woodland worth 400 pigs (annual turnover of swine livestock). The head manor was Hitchin, which was owned by the King. ;Name Alternative names of the village in this period were Weston (11th century), Weston Tregoz (early 14th century) and Weston Inge (14th century); these are documented in such documents as Patent Rolls of the King's letters patent. The spelling Weston Hyng may be a further alternative, used in 1396.Plea Rolls of the Court of Common Pleas; CP 40 / 541; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/AALT6/R2/CP40no541a/bCP40no541adorses/IMG_0190.htm; 5th entry, line 3, where Henry Kynne, was living; (a place called 'Pertenale' is also mentioned, possibly Pertenhall, in Beds.) ;Early History of Weston Manor, later Weston Tregoz Manor and finally Westoning Manor The manor first left complete royal demesne, with the unfettered right to appoint mesne lords, in 1173 when the King granted the estate worth ¬£15 per year to Roger de Sanford who three years later owed 5 marks for default (of the annual knight's fee) to the King. His executors negotiated a notified Release of it to William de Buckland who paid ¬£100 to effectively be seized of the whole village, save the churchlands; in 1216 his son-in-law, Robert de Ferrar, inherited. His son-in- law was to receive it by a family settlement yet unfortunately this man named William d'Avrenches died before 1230 and his son before 1235, thus the lands descended to Hamon de Crevec≈ìur via a daughter, followed by his son William and his widow Mabel who later married John Tregoz (before her death in 1297). Three co-heirs followed, the family of William de Crevec≈ìur's three sisters (Agnes, Isolda and Eleanor). Agnes's share descended to Juliana de Weylondon, the other two-thirds were purchased by 1299 by an acquisitive William Inge. He enhanced his portion of the manor by gaining in 1303 a Royal Licence on his portion to hold a weekly market and annual fair. Five years later Inge acquired the remaining third of the Weston Manor. Inge was Chief Justice of the King's Bench in the reign of Edward II, and in 1310 received a grant of 100 marks as recompense for wages and horses lost by him in his Scottish war. By 1371 the lands (and the manorial rights) passed to William la Zouche, son of Joan, daughter and heir of William Inge, Lords of the Manor of Eaton Bray; this line ran both estates until 1525‚Äì6 when a later William la Zouche died during the Wars of the Roses. ;Early history of Aynells Manor John Aynell held this manor directly of the King in the mid-fourteenth century. By 1418 it was held by John Shathewell of Priestley and Isabel his wife and in 1480 descended from Thomas Rufford to his son, and then in turn, his son, who in 1541 released all of the rights and land to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. This land in 1543 was described as \\"a messuage with certain lands called Aynells, on which was a charge of 10s. payable to Westoning Chantry\\", which had been endowed with land by a prominent lord of the main manor in 1314, William Inge. In 1708 the College paid \\"An outrent to the king, 10s.\\" The last item represents the 10s. formerly paid to Westoning chantry before its dissolution. The Dissolution of the Chantries took place in 1549, at which time the priest of the chantry in the church was described as 'but meanly [averagely] learned, not able to serve a cure [of souls] and hath no other living but this chantry.'J. E. Brown, Bedfordshire Chantry Certificates pp 56 and 83 ;Rectory The rectory of Westoning was transferred by the Crown from the Nunnery at Elstow Abbey to Thomas Hungate and Simon Aynesworth in 1550. Until the beginning of the 19th century the rectory shared the history of Westoning Manor, when Francis Penyston was impropriator of the rectorial tithes (and thus liability) and they passed to his daughter, who held them in 1836 and in 1912 they were vested in the Penyston trustees. ;Remaining estates Younges Manor, mostly in Westoning, is recorded for the first time in 1682, when it was held by Henrietta Wentworth, 6th Baroness Wentworth with her manor of Toddington. These lands descended with Toddington up to the beginning of the 19th century but all trace of it is lost after 1803. At the time of the Dissolution, Woburn Abbey held lands in Westoning with an annual value of ¬£2 18s. 2¬Ωd., but no further mention of this property has been found. Mention occurs of a water mill in an extent (survey document of the extent) of Westoning Manor made in 1297, and in 1322 two mills are found attached to the manor. Another extent dated fifty years later again mentions one mill, then worth nothing, and reference is found to it in a document as late as 1615. However no mills were in the parish in 1912. =Post Dissolution of the Monasteries/Reformation= Henry VIII summoned a later La Zouche as lord of the manor in 1533 to show on what (e.g. annual) service his ancestors held the manor. He proved that the manor was and always had been held of the king by great serjeanty, accordingly paid ¬£4 for relief from the next services due. In 1542 the la Zouche family surrendered the estate to the Crown in exchange for a Royal one in Derbyshire and Henry had it attached to the Royal Honor of Ampthill. From 1555 the crown granted Westoning Manor to the Curzons acquired it, descending to Sir George Farmer (before 1615), Sir Halton Farmer or Fermor and then Sir William Fermor, colonel of horse for the King in the Civil War. On the restoration his title was restored, afterwards succeeded by his son who represented Northampton and became Baron Leominster, in turn whose son inherited Westoning in 1711 and became Earl of Pomfret or Pontefract in 1722. In the 17th century Westoning was inhabited by the wandering religious man, and an early Baptist forefather John Bunyan, who wrote The Pilgrim's Progress; he was arrested on 12 November 1660 shortly after the restricted religious rights introduced on the Restoration of the Monarchy for preaching privately in Lower Samsell in the village. John Everitt purchased the manor in 1767, whose son of the same name was knighted, another of the same name held it until he died in 1836, after which his executors sold the property to Reverend J. W. C. Campion in whose family it remained until Major Coventry Campion died in 1903 to be purchased from his widow, later Mrs Blyth-King, by the Spensley family. =Post-Industrial Revolution= Westoning has varied soil,Map ‚Äì National Soil Research Institute ‚Äì Cranfield University on a subsoil of strong clay, which was in this period worked in a claypit disused by 1912 at Westoning Wood End, for the manufacture of bricks, these works being in the south of the parish close by the Midland Main Line (shared with Thameslink). Westoning made news headlines on 11 September 1976 when, at 07:10, a Texaco petrol tanker overturned in the High Street. The tanker subsequently caught fire and exploded, destroying eight houses. Twenty-one people were made homeless and over a hundred more were evacuated from their homes. Fortunately, nobody was injured in the blast but a number of fireman were hurt when their fire engine overturned on attending the scene. Eyewitness accounts state that petrol seeped into the surface water drainage system and cast iron inspection covers were blown into the air when the fire spread and ignited the petrol vapour in the drains. Westoning is protected from further development and expansion due to being bordered by green belt land as a green buffer on all sides and by the M1 motorway. The village has, however, seen substantial development throughout the last century with new developments including the roads: Highfields, Home Farm Way, and Manor Park Drive. Since 2000, Westoning Manor house was redeveloped into expensive and exclusive flats ‚Äî most of its grounds were at the same time developed into very large four and five bedroom detached houses. Howard Spensley in 1912 owned it, then a comparatively modern building of brick and stone, although a large quantity of old woodwork he said was taken from the house at Wrest Park, on its construction being demolished, and from the old Palace of Westminster, incorporated in the design of many of the rooms and staircases. The moated site of the earlier manor is to its southwest, and a second manor was southwest of the village centre by Westoning Wood End Farm. Demography Westoning has an approximate population of 2,001 (based on 2001 statistics) and its average income level is above the national average.2001 Census Governance The village is represented on the Central Bedfordshire Council; it forms part of the Westoning and Tingrith ward and has its own civil parish council who meet to decide on local matters.

Westoning Village Hall is situated in Church Road and is fortunate to stage regular productions by the village's amateur dramatic society, the Westoning Players.Village Hall The building dates back to the 1840s and has a long and colourful history of village life. The village hall also runs a pre-school service. Westoning Lower School is situated in the heart in the village and is known for its many social occasions that include performances such as country dancing. Many performances are conducted at the village fair. Westoning Recreation Club holds an annual event to serve as a fund raising event for the football, the tennis, its other sports and the Lower School. For the past few years this annual event has been a \\"Donkey Derby\\". The Recreation Club also holds real ale festivals twice a year, other events include a summer f√™te and church f√™te which are held within the recreation ground and vicarage grounds respectively. =Folklore= Westoning is the location of \\"An Execution and a Miracle\\", a 12th Century legend. In the tale, a man named Fulke had refused to pay his rent of one denarius to a local farmer, Ailward or Eilward. On an upcoming holiday, Ailward suggested that Fulke should repay half his debt in settlement and keep the rest for drinking, but Fulke refused. Ailward flew into a rage and headed for Fulke's house where he broke in and he seized a grindstone and a pair of gloves, but Fulke followed him, broke his head open, stabbed him in the arm, bound him, and, at the suggestion of the local beadle, accused him of stealing many more objects. Found guilty at his trial, Ailward was sent to the ducking pond where he would be found guilty if he floated and innocent if he sank (and drowned). Ailward floated, was deemed guilty, and was left at the side of the road, castrated and his eyes gouged out. A local farmer found him and took him home. After days of praying, Ailward's eyes and testicles grew back (though his eyes were different colours and his testicles were smaller than they had been before). He devoted the rest of his years to St. Thomas.Edwin A. Abbott. St. Thomas of Canterbury: His Death and Miracles (1898).

More accurately, it is a local bifurcation in which a fixed point of a dynamical system loses stability, as a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues‚Äîof the linearization around the fixed point‚Äîcrosses the complex plane imaginary axis. Under reasonably generic assumptions about the dynamical system, a small- amplitude limit cycle branches from the fixed point. A Hopf bifurcation is also known as a Poincar√©-Andronov-Hopf bifurcation, named after Henri Poincar√©, Aleksandr Andronov and Eberhard Hopf.  Overview  = Supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcations = Dynamics of the Hopf bifurcation near \\\\lambda=0. Possible trajectories in red, stable structures in dark blue and unstable structures in dashed light blue. Supercritical Hopf bifurcation: 1a) stable fixed point 1b) unstable fixed point, stable limit cycle 1c) phase space dynamics. Subcritical Hopf bifurcation: 2a) stable fixed point, unstable limit cycle 2b) unstable fixed point 2c) phase space dynamics. \\\\omega determines the angular dynamics and therefore the direction of winding for the trajectories. The limit cycle is orbitally stable if a specific quantity called the first Lyapunov coefficient is negative, and the bifurcation is supercritical. Otherwise it is unstable and the bifurcation is subcritical. The normal form of a Hopf bifurcation is: ::\\\\frac{dz}{dt}=z((\\\\lambda + i ) + b z^2), where z, b are both complex and Œª is a parameter. Write: b= \\\\alpha + i \\\\beta. \\\\, The number Œ± is called the first Lyapunov coefficient. * If Œ± is negative then there is a stable limit cycle for Œª > 0: :: z(t) = r e^{i \\\\omega t} \\\\, : where :: r=\\\\sqrt{-\\\\lambda/\\\\alpha}\\\\text{ and }\\\\omega= 1 + \\\\beta r^2. \\\\, : The bifurcation is then called supercritical. * If Œ± is positive then there is an unstable limit cycle for Œª < 0\\\\. The bifurcation is called subcritical. = Example = The Hopf bifurcation in the Selkov system (see article). As the parameters change, a limit cycle (in blue) appears out of a stable equilibrium. Hopf bifurcations occur in the Lotka‚ÄìVolterra model of predator‚Äìprey interaction (known as paradox of enrichment), the Hodgkin‚ÄìHuxley model for nerve membrane,. the Selkov model of glycolysis, the Belousov- Zhabotinsky reaction, the Lorenz attractor, and the Brusselator. The Selkov model is : \\\\frac{dx}{dt} = -x + ay + x^2 y, ~~ \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = b - a y - x^2 y. The phase portrait illustrating the Hopf bifurcation in the Selkov model is shown on the right.For detailed derivation, see In railway vehicle systems, Hopf bifurcation analysis is notably important. Conventionally a railway vehicle's stable motion at low speeds crosses over to unstable at high speeds. One aim of the nonlinear analysis of these systems is to perform an analytical investigation of bifurcation, nonlinear lateral stability and hunting behavior of rail vehicles on a tangent track, which uses the Bogoliubov method.  Definition of a Hopf bifurcation  The appearance or the disappearance of a periodic orbit through a local change in the stability properties of a fixed point is known as the Hopf bifurcation. The following theorem works for fixed points with one pair of conjugate nonzero purely imaginary eigenvalues. It tells the conditions under which this bifurcation phenomenon occurs. Theorem (see section 11.2 of ). Let J_0 be the Jacobian of a continuous parametric dynamical system evaluated at a steady point Z_e. Suppose that all eigenvalues of J_0 have negative real part except one conjugate nonzero purely imaginary pair \\\\pm i\\\\beta. A Hopf bifurcation arises when these two eigenvalues cross the imaginary axis because of a variation of the system parameters.  Routh-Hurwitz criterion  Routh-Hurwitz criterion (section I.13 of ) gives necessary conditions so that a Hopf bifurcation occurs. Let us see how one can use concretely this idea. = Sturm series = Let p_0,p_1,\\\\dots,p_k be Sturm series associated to a characteristic polynomial P. They can be written in the form: : p_i(\\\\mu)= c_{i,0} \\\\mu^{k-i} + c_{i,1} \\\\mu^{k-i-2} + c_{i,2} \\\\mu^{k-i-4}+\\\\cdots The coefficients c_{i,0} for i in \\\\\\\\{1,\\\\dots,k\\\\\\\\} correspond to what is called Hurwitz determinants. Their definition is related to the associated Hurwitz matrix. = Propositions = Proposition 1. If all the Hurwitz determinants c_{i,0} are positive, apart perhaps c_{k,0} then the associated Jacobian has no pure imaginary eigenvalues. Proposition 2. If all Hurwitz determinants c_{i,0} (for all i in \\\\\\\\{0,\\\\dots,k-2\\\\\\\\} are positive, c_{k-1,0}=0 and c_{k-2,1}<0 then all the eigenvalues of the associated Jacobian have negative real parts except a purely imaginary conjugate pair. The conditions that we are looking for so that a Hopf bifurcation occurs (see theorem above) for a parametric continuous dynamical system are given by this last proposition.  Example  Consider the classical Van der Pol oscillator written with ordinary differential equations: : \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{l} \\\\dfrac{dx}{dt} = \\\\mu (1-y^2)x - y, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\dfrac{dy}{dt} = x. \\\\end{array} \\\\right . The Jacobian matrix associated to this system follows: : J = \\\\begin{pmatrix} -\\\\mu (-1+y^2) & -2 \\\\mu y x -1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 \\\\end{pmatrix}. The characteristic polynomial (in \\\\lambda) of the linearization at (0,0) is equal to: : P(\\\\lambda) = \\\\lambda^2 - \\\\mu \\\\lambda + 1. The coefficients are: a_0=1, a_1=-\\\\mu, a_2=1 The associated Sturm series is: : \\\\begin{array}{l} p_0(\\\\lambda)=a_0 \\\\lambda^2 -a_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ p_1(\\\\lambda)=a_1 \\\\lambda \\\\end{array} The Sturm polynomials can be written as (here i=0,1): : p_i(\\\\mu)= c_{i,0} \\\\mu^{k-i} + c_{i,1} \\\\mu^{k-i-2} + c_{i,2} \\\\mu^{k-i-4}+\\\\cdots The above proposition 2 tells that one must have: : c_{0,0} = 1 >0, c_{1,0}=- \\\\mu = 0, c_{0,1}=-1 <0\\\\. Because 1 > 0 and ‚àí1 < 0 are obvious, one can conclude that a Hopf bifurcation may occur for Van der Pol oscillator if \\\\mu = 0.

Tyler is best remembered as a leading American labor intellectual of the post-World War II era and as the author of a history of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union.  Biography  = Early years = August Tyler was born Augustus Tilove to Jewish immigrants in Brooklyn, New York on October 18, 1911.\\"Gus Tyler, Labor Activist and Forward Columnist, Is Dead at 99,\\" Jewish Daily Forward, June 5, 2011. He later changed his surname in honor of Wat Tyler, the leader of the English Peasants' Revolt in 1381. Tyler was the product of a radical upbringing, as he later recalled in a 1988 interview with New York Newsday: > As far as my mother was concerned, socialism was what God ordained. You > didn't learn it from Marx or anybody; it was just the natural thing. People > are people and they shouldn't be rich and they shouldn't be poor. I just > thought this was the way you live. You're supposed to be a socialist and > ultimately the whole world goes socialist.Douglas Martin, \\"Gus Tyler, > Firebrand of Labor Movement, Dies at 99,\\" New York Times, June 12, 2011, pg. > A32. Tyler was a leading figure in the \\"Clarity caucus,\\" organized around the revolutionary socialist magazine Socialist Clarity. Tyler attended New York University on a scholarship in the early 1930s, where he became involved in left-wing political activities, including public speaking on street corners on behalf of the Young People's Socialist League (YPSL), the youth section of the Socialist Party.Gus Tyler, \\"Throats in Trouble,\\" Jewish Daily Forward, August 1, 2008. Upon graduating in 1932, Tyler briefly worked as a writer for the Yiddish-language socialist newspaper The Jewish Daily Forward. He also served as editor of Free Youth, one of the YPSL's short-lived publications of the early 1930s. Tyler rose through the ranks of the YPSL, rising to the top leadership position in the group. This post gave Tyler a seat with top leaders of the adult party, making him a key leader in the bitter factional war that occupied the Socialist Party in that period. Tyler was a supporter of the so- called \\"Militant faction\\" of the Socialist Party against the older generation of party regulars known as the Old Guard and was later active in the far-left \\"Clarity caucus\\" after the Militants themselves fragmented.The Clarity caucus was named after its periodical, Socialist Clarity, and included Herbert Zam, Max Delson, and Robert Delson, along with Tyler as its prominent leaders. See: David A. Shannon, The Socialist Party of America: A History. New York: Macmillan, 1955; pg. 251. Along with many on the American left, Tyler was a vigorous opponent of rearmament for a new World War, authoring a resolution which declared the Socialist Party would support no war except a war for socialism.Shannon, The Socialist Party, pg. 252. In making this pronouncement Tyler reasoned that the distinction between democratic-capitalist and fascist countries would be essentially meaningless in the event of war since the militarization of society inherent in the act of going to war would reduce the democratic nations themselves to reactionary dictatorships. Tyler declared that the only course for the Socialist Party was to organize the dissident forces created by a new war in order to \\"smash the capitalist system.\\" He condemned the ongoing agitation for collective security against fascism being preached by the Communist Party and many liberals, as \\"asking the working class to sign a blanket check even before a war, endorsing support in the event of war.\\" The Socialist Party imploded in a frenzy of factional warfare during the second half of the 1930s, with the party's Old Guard right wing leaving to form the Social Democratic Federation (established in 1936) and the Trotskyist left wing expelled en masse to form the Socialist Workers Party (established in 1938). With its membership and funds depleted, many activists in the Socialist Party were forced to turn their efforts elsewhere. = Union career = Tyler's intelligence and commitment seems to have caught the attention of International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union (ILGWU) president David Dubinsky.Robert E. Lazar, \\"Guide to the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. Gus Tyler. Assistant President's records, 1952-1980, Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives, Cornell University Library, 1981. Despite the fact that Dubinsky was himself a stalwart of the Socialist Party's Old Guard, Tyler was offered a staff job with the ILGWU in its education department. Tyler held a succession of positions in the union rising in 1945 to the post of Assistant President, a position he held until his retirement in 1989.Associated Press, \\"NY Labor Union Activist Gus Tyler Dies in Florida,\\" New York Times, June 4, 2011. In an autobiographic essay, Tyler once noted that his career in the ILGWU was interrupted by the war. \\"When I returned from my stint as an aerial gunner, I suggested to Dubinsky that the union create a full-time political department. He argued that no union had such a department. I told him he had a reputation as an innovator. He was flattered. I got the job.\\" Tyler later worked with the ILGWU's successor union, UNITE, as an assistant to the president, and for many years hosted his own radio program on station WEVD (a radio station owned by The Forward Association and named after Eugene Victor Debs) in New York. When the English-language version of the Forward launched in 1990, Tyler began writing for the publication, penning a weekly column in the paper until 2006. Tyler authored several works of historical scholarship, including a 1995 history of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union published by the noted academic publisher M. E. Sharpe. As a leading public intellectual, Tyler wrote prolifically. He continued to write a periodic column for The Jewish Daily Forward entitled \\"Tyler Too\\" well into his 90s. =Death and legacy= Gus Tyler died on June 3, 2011 in Sarasota, Florida, at the age of 99. He was survived by two children and three grandchildren. Tyler, it was recalled in The New York Times at the time of his death, \\"tumbled through life like a Saul Bellow character, full of analytic thought and urban vitality. He wore multifarious hats: pamphleteer, professor and poet, but insisted on defining himself with a single word: agitator. ... His most powerful weapons were words, in books, newspaper columns, radio commentaries and speeches he wrote for labor chieftains.\\" Tyler's papers are included in several collections at the Kheel Center for Labor-Management Documentation and Archives at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.

Opened during the 1976 Bicentennial celebrations, the AAMP is located in historic Philadelphia on Arch Street, a few blocks away from the Liberty Bell. Collection AAMP currently houses four galleries and an auditorium, each of which offers exhibitions anchored on one of three dominant themes: The African Diaspora, the Philadelphia Story, and the Contemporary Narrative. The museum is home to more than 750,000 objects, images and documents that are made available for research, exhibitions, for loan to other museums, and used in the museum‚Äôs many educational programs. Temporary exhibits, as well as a variety of family events, workshops, films, tours, symposiums, and concerts relating to African- American culture and history are offered. The AAMP‚Äôs collection includes, among other things, flyers, memos and memorabilia related to the Philadelphia Black Panthers, correspondence clippings and military artifacts of the first black doctor to direct a U.S. Army Hospital, academic and legal papers from Harry Shapiro on constitutional issues arising from the civil rights movement, African American occupational and domestic objects, family scrapbooks, sports memorabilia, church and burial records, and artifacts from the Ku Klux Klan. History Philadelphia has long been known as an important center for African American history and culture. As the United States was being formed in the 18th century, Philadelphia was the center of the abolitionist movement and had the largest free black population. Founding director Charles H. Wesley was a noted African American historian, educator, and author. He was the fourth African American to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard University. An ordained minister, Wesley‚Äôs distinguished career included 40 years of leadership with the African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1976, he served as Director of what was then known as the Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum in Philadelphia. Renaming In 1997 the Afro-American Historical and Cultural Museum became known as the African American Museum in Philadelphia, under executive director Terri S. Rouse. Reopening In 2007, the AAMP received a $3 million grant from the city of Philadelphia for building renovations and improving displays for the museum's extensive collection. The museum closed March 9, 2009, and reopened June 18, 2009, with the unveiling of AUDACIOUS FREEDOM, a new core exhibit installation featuring the early history of African Americans in Philadelphia (1776‚Äì1876).

It is the main recognised Anglican Franciscan order, but there are also other Franciscan orders in the Anglican Communion. thumb The Society of Saint Francis comprises the Brothers of the First Order; the Sisters of the First Order; the Sisters of the Second Order; the Brothers and Sisters of the Third Order.The Society of Saint Francis ‚Äì The Constitution\\" Francis of Assisi and Clare of Assisi, the founders of the Franciscan movement produced separate rules for three parallel orders ‚Äì the First Order were to be mendicant friars, embracing poverty as a gift from God and living the community life in the world and serving the poor. The Second Order were to be a parallel community of sisters living a more enclosed life of prayer and contemplation. The Third Order was to consist of brothers and sisters not living in community, nor under full monastic vows, but nevertheless taking simple promises and following a rule of life in the world. These three orders still co-exist as parts of the Franciscan family.See details on this website. Within Anglicanism, the Brothers of the First Order are called the Society of Saint Francis (SSF); the Sisters of the First Order are called the Community of Saint Francis (CSF); the members of the Second Order are called the Community of Saint Clare (OSC); and the Brothers and Sisters of the Third Order are called the Third Order of the Society of Saint Francis (TSSF).Society of Saint Francis ‚Äì Constitution History During the English Reformation all religious orders, including Franciscans, were banished from Britain. Not until the mid 19th century were the first sisterhoods refounded in the Church of England, in response to the social needs of the time. Then came a revival of interest in Francis. The Community of St Francis (CSF) was founded in 1905 with sisters living in poverty and working in the East End of London. The Friary of St Francis, Hilfield Shortly after World War I, the Revd Douglas Downes, an economics don at Oxford University, and a few friends gave practical expression to their sympathy with and concern for victims of the depression by going out onto the roads and sharing the life of the homeless men and boys, looking for work from town to town. In 1921, a Dorset landowner, Lord Sandwich, offered a small farm property (now Hilfield Friary),Hilfield is a hamlet in west Dorset, England, situated under the scarp face of the Dorset Downs seven miles south of Sherborne. and here the group of friends was able to offer shelter to the exhausted wayfarers and others in temporary need of help. In 1934, another small group (led by Father Algy) who had a clearer idea of forming a religious order, joined Brother Douglas (as he liked to be called). Gradually the little community took shape, modelling itself more consciously on the Franciscan tradition of prayer and study, as well as working with the poor. It started to look like a religious order in formal sense, with habits, a chapel, and regular worship. The Society of Saint Francis came into being, followed by the Third Order in 1936, and the Second Order in 1950 with the establishment of the Community of Saint Clare in Freeland, Witney. Before long, invitations came to establish centres in other places and at the start of World War II, there were houses in south London and Cambridge. After the war other centres were opened in Britain. Establishments overseas followed and the Society now has friaries in the United States, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Costa Rica, and the Solomon Islands. Other communities were made in (Germany), Italy, Africa and the West Indies. The Daily Office, SSF's office book, was among the first to be fully updated with the Common Worship lectionary, so was used in the wider Anglican Communion. It provided the model for Morning and Evening Prayer in Common Worship. Structure Each part of the order is under the leadership of a minister general, currently Br Christopher John SSF (elected in 2017) for the First Order brothers, Sr Helen Julian CSF (elected in 2012) for the First Order sisters, and John Hebenton TSSF (elected in 2017) for the Third Order brothers and sisters. Under the minister general the order is divided into provinces, each governed by a minister provincial. The Second Order, being enclosed, elect an abbess, and are currently active only in the United Kingdom.

Biography Brislin was born in New Jersey into a musical family. The youngest of his siblings, he first played the piano at home and practiced by reciting theme tunes to television shows. He then received formal lessons. Before he could play, Brislin drew album covers and devised song titles. An early influence came from his sisters who played 1970s progressive rock albums which introduced him to keyboardists Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman. He gained further inspiration in the 1980s from music by Duran Duran, The Police, and jazz musician Herbie Hancock. Brislin graduated from Immaculata High School in Somerville, New Jersey in 1991; the school inducted him into its hall of fame in 2016.Kuboski, Terry. \\"Immaculata High School inducts Hall of Fame Class of 2016\\", Courier News, December 31, 2016.

In the 1990s, Brislin was a member of You Were Spiraling which was initially formed of a \\"rotating cast of local musicians\\" that eventually turned into a full- time band. In 2002, Brislin reformed the group and renamed them Spiraling which was followed by their debut album, Transmitter. Brislin was the sole songwriter for the group. The band toured in support of They Might Be Giants, Violent Femmes, and OK Go. Brislin gained wider recognition when he was hired as a touring keyboardist for the progressive rock band Yes for their 2001 YesSymphonic Tour. He also became known for his work with Meat Loaf, Debbie Harry, and Renaissance. Brislin is the author of 30-Day Keyboard Workout, and was a writer for Keyboard Magazine from 2001-2014. Brislin released his debut solo album, Hurry Up and Smell the Roses in 2012. The album, which Brislin describes as \\"Cinematic Pop\\", was written, produced, performed, and recorded by Brislin.

Ridge produces wine at two winery locations in northern California. The original winery facilities are located at an elevation of on Monte Bello Ridge in unincorporated Santa Clara County in the Santa Cruz Mountains AVA, south of Los Altos, California and west of Cupertino, California. The other Ridge winery facilities are at Lytton Springs in the Dry Creek Valley AVA of Sonoma County. Ridge Vineyard's 1971 Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon gained prominence for its fifth-place finish in the 1976 \\"Judgment of Paris\\" wine tasting. History left Although Ridge Vineyards was founded in the early 1960s, wine production at the winery's Monte Bello location has a much longer history. Grapevines were first planted on Monte Bello Ridge by Osea Perrone, a doctor and prominent member of the northern California Italian immigrant community, in 1885. The first Monte Bello wine was produced in 1892. Following Prohibition, the vineyard at Monte Bello passed through the hands of several amateur winemakers until it was purchased in 1959 by David Bennion, Charles Rosen, Hewitt Crane, and Howard Zeidler, all engineers at nearby Stanford Research Institute. Ridge Vineyards was bonded and produced its first commercial wine, a Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon, in 1962. According to a 1987 New York Times article, Ridge Vineyards was acquired by a Japanese company. \\"The new owner is Otsuka U.S., a subsidiary of the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, a producer of nutritional drinks and other pharmaceutical products. Otsuka operates an experimental wine-making center near Fuji, in Japan.\\"View from Ridge Vineyards on Monte Bello Ridge, Santa Cruz Mountains.left The international reputation of the Monte Bello wine produced by Ridge Vineyards was established when it achieved fifth place in the \\"Judgment of Paris\\", against nine other French and California wines. Monte Bello Cabernet Sauvignon was acclaimed in subsequent competitions, including The Judgment of Paris 30th Anniversary, the 30th anniversary retesting of the same red wines evaluated in the 1976 Paris wine competition. In this blind tasting, held both in the United States and in the United Kingdom, judges in both countries ranked Ridge Monte Bello number one among all the wines judged. Ridge Vineyards produced its first Zinfandel in 1964. Beginning in 1966, the winery began sourcing some grapes for its Geyserville Zinfandel and other wines from vineyards in Sonoma County. In 1991, Ridge Vineyards purchased the Lytton Springs vineyard in the Dry Creek Valley AVA. The winery produces wine at both the Monte Bello and Lytton Springs locations, and operates tasting rooms open to the public at both.  Winemakers  Back label of 1990 Monte Bello = David Bennion = In 1959, David Bennion purchased the 80 acre winery and vineyard above Cupertino in the Santa Cruz Mountains. That same year, he produced his very first wine, a Cabernet Sauvignon from the estate. Excited by the quality of the early wines, the partners decided to re-bond the winery in time for the 1962 vintage, calling their endeavor Ridge Vineyards. By focusing on single-vineyard Zinfandels‚ÄîSonoma, Santa Cruz, Lodi, Paso Robles‚ÄîBennion showed that Zinfandel can express terroir. He would go on to make single-vineyard wines from many other varieties including: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Ruby Cabernet, Carginan and Pinot Blanc. His winemaking style championed minimal intervention. A major component of this philosophy was to make use of the natural yeasts on the grapes. To this end, only a small amount of Sulfur would be used during the winemaking process. This process would only kill off the wild yeasts but allow the wine yeasts to survive on the grapes. In 1967 Dave Bennion left SRI completely, to become the first president and winemaker of Ridge. Bennion served as winemaker at Ridge until 1970, when he hired Paul Draper to oversee winemaking operations. After hiring Draper, Bennion continued to serve as the President of Ridge until 1984. = Paul Draper = Ridge had been under the direction of winemaker Paul Draper since 1971. He was hired by David Bennion and emphasized natural, ecologically sustainable farming and fermentation. Draper is known for drying his own oak staves for use in barrels, which may be a component of the dusty \\"Draper Perfume\\" that is characteristic of Ridge wines. on 1 July 2016, Draper retired as CEO and Head Winemaker of the company, but remains chairman of the board. He produced 47 vintages for Ridge. Wines 190x190px Ridge also focuses on single-estate wines where the grapes for a particular label are all grown at the same vineyard. The signature wine of Ridge is its Monte Bello, a field blend of Cabernet Sauvignon mixed with varying percentages of other grapes grown in the same location, usually including Merlot, Petit Verdot, and occasionally Cabernet Franc. Ridge's Zinfandels (or mostly-Zinfandel field blends) constitute the bulk of the winery's production. Using grapes from selected sites from all over the state and bottling them each under their own label, Ridge Zinfandels emphasize the particular characteristics of each growing site and may show different aging characteristics than do other Zinfandels. Among the best known of the Ridge Zinfandels or Zinfandel-blends are those from Geyserville, York Creek, and Lytton Springs.

He also represented Toulouse in Ligue 1, and while on loan at FC Z√ºrich, he won the Swiss Super League in 2007. Born in Brazil, he became a naturalised Tunisian before their hosting of the 2004 Africa Cup of Nations, and was joint top scorer as they won it. He also played at two more such tournaments, and the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Club career Born in Z√© Doca, Maranh√£o, Brazil, Santos began his professional career with Standard Li√®ge in Belgium, before spending two years with √âtoile Sportive du Sahel in Tunisia.

In February 2004, he was removed from the squad to avoid a doping ban due to his corticoid use, as the club awaited a facsimile of his prescription from Tunisia. After nine goals in his final Ligue 1 season, Santos turned down a new two-year contract to sign for fellow league team Toulouse FC on a three-year deal in May 2005. Having played only four times under manager √âlie Baup in his second season, he was loaned to FC Z√ºrich of the Swiss Super League in February 2007 for the rest of the season. In May, he opened a 2‚Äì0 win against city rivals Grasshopper Club Z√ºrich to take the title. On 1 July 2008, Santos returned to Sochaux on a one-year deal.

He opened the scoring after five minutes in the final, a 2‚Äì1 win over rivals Morocco at the Stade 7 Novembre. With four goals, he was one of five joint top scorers. In June 2004, Santos apologised for having draped himself in the Brazilian flag when celebrating Sochaux's Coupe de la Ligue win. He was Tunisia's top scorer with five goals in qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup; this included four on 26 March 2005 as they beat Malawi 7‚Äì0 at home.

She was born in Selma, Alabama, and grew up in nearby Thomasville. Windham got her first writing job at the age of 12, reviewing movies for her cousin's small town newspaper, The Thomasville Times. She earned a B.A. degree from Huntingdon College in 1939. Soon after graduating she became the first woman journalist for the Alabama Journal. Starting in 1944, she worked for The Birmingham News. In 1946 she married Amasa Benjamin Windham with whom she had three children. In 1956 she went to work at the Selma Times-Journal where she won several Associated Press awards for her writing and photography. She died on June 12, 2011. She was a longtime friend of Nall who introduced her works to the art world at large. Ghost stories Kathryn Tucker Windham wrote a series of books of \\"true\\" ghost stories, based on local folklore, beginning with 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey (1969). Other titles were Jeffrey Introduces 13 More Southern Ghosts (1971), 13 Georgia Ghosts and Jeffrey (1973), 13 Mississippi Ghosts and Jeffrey (1974), 13 Tennessee Ghosts and Jeffrey (1976), and Jeffrey's Latest 13: More Alabama Ghosts (1982). In 2004, she wrote Jeffrey's Favorite 13 Ghost Stories, which was a collection of featured stories from the previous books. =Jeffrey= Jeffrey is a purported ghost that took up residence in the Windham house in October 1966. According to a letter printed in the foreword to 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey, Windham became interested in ghost stories after this ghost began to haunt her family. At first, the family heard footsteps in rooms that would later be found empty. Sometimes, objects had been moved. A photo allegedly of Jeffrey was accidentally taken when some young people visiting the Windham home decided to play with a Ouija board in an effort to contact the ghost. When photos from that night were developed, a dark shadowy blot with a vaguely human-like shape was found to be in one image. Soon after this picture was taken, Windham contacted Margaret Gillis , who was a noted collector of ghost stories, to ask about Jeffrey. Out of that meeting, the idea for 13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey was inspired. Storytelling Following an invitation to speak at the National Storytelling Festival in Jonesborough, Tennessee, Windham began to gain attention for storytelling. She often appeared at storytelling events, historical meetings and classrooms. Her stories about ghosts and growing up and living in the Southern United States have earned her a place on National Public Radio's All Things Considered, which brought her national attention and praise. She also performed stories and gave commentaries on Alabama Public Radio's Alabama Life. Mrs. Windham's commentaries were recorded by APR producers Samuel Hendren, Jason Norton and Brett Tannehill. Her commentaries still air the first weekday of every month on 89.3 WLRH Huntsville Public Radio's Sundial Writers Corner. Windham is the founder of the Alabama Tale Tellin' Festival, which has been held annually in Selma since 1978. Kathryn Tucker Windham appeared on stage in a one-woman play about Julia Tutwiler. Named They Call Me Julia,it was based on Windham's book of the same name. Museum The Thomasville campus of Coastal Alabama Community College is the site of the Kathryn Tucker Windham Museum. Her personal papers and manuscripts from 1939‚Äì2010 were donated to the special collections department of the Auburn University Libraries.

In 1950, he joined the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London and by 1966 had settled in Rome. He was a campaigner for wider access to arts and culture for young people, promoting the health benefits of music, the arts, and sport. He returned to the United Kingdom and from 1987 he became more widely known as the driving force behind the creation of that country's National Lottery. He was president of CAARE (Council for the Advancement of Arts, Recreation & Education), the charity he founded in 1996. Biography Denis Edward Vaughan was born on 6 June 1926 in Melbourne, Australia. He graduated from University of Melbourne with a Bachelor of Music in 1947. He won a scholarship to study organ and double bass at England's Royal College of Music (1947‚Äì1950), under the tutelage of George Thalben-Ball and Eugene Cruft. In March and April 1949 he represented the Organ Music Society in performances at St Luke's Church, Chelsea. In October then-Princess Elizabeth of York (see Elizabeth II) presented Vaughan with the Tagore Gold Medal for general achievement during 1949. In March the following year he performed with George Malcolm for the Organ Music Society at King's College Chapel, University of London. In 1950, he joined the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO) and went on tour to the United States with Thomas Beecham. By 1954 Vaughan was assistant conductor and chorus master of the RPO and formed the Beecham Choral Society. In the 1950s and early 1960s he participated in annual concerts featuring four harpsichordists, with Malcolm, Thurston Dart and fellow Australian, Eileen Joyce. In 1957 this group recorded two of Vivaldi's Concertos for Four Harpsichords, one in a Bach arrangement, with the Pro Arte Orchestra under Boris Ord. They also recorded Malcolm's Variations on a Theme of Mozart. The ensemble's works were issued in June 1958 by Angel Records for the US market. He followed with engagements at La Scala, Hamburg and Munich opera houses and a season at Bayreuth as assistant to Hans Knappertsbusch. In 1959, together with Klemperer, Celibidache, Bernstein and Maazel, Vaughan was invited to conduct one of the special concerts performed in Parma in honour of Arturo Toscanini. At that time he corresponded with Italian conductor Gianandrea Gavazzeni on the works of Giacomo Puccini and Giuseppe Verdi.. By 1966 he had moved to Rome and received wider acclaim by his recordings for RCA Victor. His discography with the Orchestra \\"Scarlatti\\" of Naples includes the complete symphonies of Schubert, twelve Haydn symphonies, other works by Schubert, Bach and Mozart, with eleven early symphonies and the opera Il re pastore (with Lucia Popp, Reri Grist, and Luigi Alva). In 1967 he provided his report, Facts and Opinions on Certain Practices Regarding Copyright in Musical Works, on behalf of the International Federation of Musicians, to the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.. From 1972 to 1980 he was in Germany as the director at the Munich State Opera House, before being appointed as musical director of the State Opera of South Australia in Adelaide (1981‚Äì84). Vaughan moved back to London in 1987 and began a campaign to establish a National Lottery in the UK, with profits to increase access to culture and sport for young people, and improve their quality of life. Following his 1988 Sunday Telegraph article \\"Why not gamble on culture?\\", Ken Hargreaves MP presented an early day motion in the House of Commons in April 1989 calling for an Arts/Sports Lottery. It received 67 all-party signatures. Less than a year later, the Adam Smith Institute invited Vaughan to write a paper, \\"The Case for a National Arts Lottery\\". Articles were also featured in the House Magazine and The Times, and Vaughan delivered an address to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Sport and Leisure Conference. In January 1992, Vaughan advised Ivan Lawrence QC, who led a debate in the House of Commons, and a year later the Commons approved the lottery in a vote. Vaughan's campaign for a National Lottery brought a sevenfold increase in funds for the arts and sport. He was described by Denis Howell as \\"the man who brought more money to sport than anyone else in the 20th Century\\". In 1990 Vaughan self-published the book, The Effect of Music on Body and Soul : How to Stay Young with Rock : How to Kick the Need for Drugs. In 1996 he founded the charity, Council for the Advancement of Arts, Recreation & Education (CAARE) to continue promoting the benefits of wider access to arts and sport, and to act as a monitor of the National Lottery's use of funds in these areas. As president of CAARE he directs the charity's work in seeking further improvements in the quality of life of young people in Britain. In 2008 his work with CAARE was highly praised in The Times (17 April) (\\"Thank heavens for campaigners such as Denis Vaughan\\"). The fundamental changes which he aims to achieve with CAARE's help include priorities in Treasury in GB, so that the daily lives of the populace are based on physical, emotional, mental and spiritual education, in equal proportions. The minimal effort put into providing facilities for and constant stimulation towards daily participation for all young people in physical and creative activities needs to be radically changed until a permanent programme is available, not at risk of being dropped as a result of bureaucratic or political whim. Vaughan's indications of how the holistic aspects of behaviour include spiritual awareness at a high level are discussed at the highest levels, including Anthony Seldon at Wellington College and Matthew Taylor at the Royal Society of Arts. Denis Vaughan is a world authority on the manuscript scores of Verdi, Puccini and Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k. In May 2005 he conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall.

Reason for creation  The original vision of the National Lottery has, in the opinion of the founders of CAARE, now been set aside as the Lottery becomes a political tool for ministers and bureaucrats. CAARE is the only charity to fully monitor Lottery spending on good causes: they are the only organisation outside government to receive monthly figures of the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF), including the surplus totals, which CAARE considers scandalous. Currently, approximately ¬£2.3 billion is sitting idly in a Lottery bank account. CAARE regularly briefs press and politicians on the state of the Lottery and its finances. Both the Public Accounts Committee in 2005 and the National Audit Office in 2004 agreed that the surplus is unacceptable and must be reduced. CAARE for Sport is the campaign to give sport the prominence it deserves in the UK. In 2001 and 2004, 41 famous names in British sport backed CAARE's calls for a substantial increase in funding for sport through the Lottery and the Government, and for a restructuring of the way in which sport and culture are managed. CAARE went to 10 Downing Street to present a petition to the Prime Minister opposing the Government's plans for sport and the Lottery. The number of signatures on the petition was more than double the number who had responded positively to the consultation announced by the Government in Parliament. CAARE has published several reports to demonstrate the importance of Lottery's original cause; Funding Physical Activity and the Arts by Benjamin Matthews (October 2007), Hurdles to Participation by James Warwick (October 2006), Arts Participation in Europe, by James Evans (October 2006), Some Economic & Social Costs of Physical Inactivity by Mike Collins and Christophe Borgus (July, 2009).

After declaring war and invading Lesser Poland, Roman and his forces (druzhina) were ambushed by the Poles in the vicinity of Zawichost by the Vistula (Visla) River. In the tumult that followed, Roman was killed and the Polish victory would lead to Poland's growing power and the weakening of Rus'.  Background  Roman of Halych receives an ambassador from Pope Innocent III, painting by Nikolai Nevrev In the 11th century, Poland and Rus' entered a border dispute and the lands of Lesser Poland and Rus' (called Ruthenia in Latin) were changing hands constantly. In the early Middle Ages, the area of what later would become Galicia was scarcely populated, as the region was settled by Rus' peoples from the east and by Poles from the west. Border-clashes took place in the lands of Przemy≈õl, Sanok, Drohiczyn and Vladimir-in-Volhynia. The decline of Kievan Rus' gave Poland the opportunity to seize control of the regions. In 1199, an armed campaign led by Leszek the White helped to install Roman the Great on the throne in Vladimir-in-Volhynia. In 1205, however, Roman declared war on Poland. The Polish chronicler, Jan D≈Çugosz, tried to give reasons for Roman's declaration of war: D≈Çugosz further explains that before crossing the Polish frontier, Roman sent emissaries to the Bishop of Vladimir and asked for his blessing, as he intended to campaign in Poland for three years. The Bishop declined Roman's gifts and denied him any blessing, explaining that \\"he cannot bless Roman or his enterprise, since he has previously started unjust and wicked wars and is again embarking on one that is quite unjustified, considering that the Poles have so often exposed their bodies to danger and death to defend the Ruthenians against the barbarians.\\" Roman responded by telling the bishop that he will cut his head off when he returns from his victory. Battle In the early spring, Roman invaded the land of Lublin and laid siege to the city. The Polish garrison was successful in defending the city, but the Rus'ian caused great destruction to the local population, as they captured and raped the wives of the knights of Lublin. Leszek then started recruiting a force of knights and peasants from Sandomierz, Kujawy, and Mazovia, which was reinforced with a force of volunteers from Krak√≥w. When Roman learned of the Polish force that was advancing towards him, he raised the siege and advanced deep into Poland by pillaging and threatening with devastation and eradication of the Latin rite. Several bishops and nobles approached Roman and asked for peace, promising to pay compensation; Roman accepted, but continued with the war. He captured some priests and had them shot at with arrows, hoping to have the location of Leszek disclosed. D≈Çugosz gives a detailed description of the battle: Leszek I the White Drawing by Jan Matejko Konrad I of Masovia Other accounts mention the same turn of events. The Suzdal Chronicle of the Laurentian Codex*Suzdal Chronicle Laurentian Codex) mentions that \\"Roman of Halych took on Poles and conquered cities. And stopped at the Vistula River with his small druzhina. Poles then attacked and killed him with the druzhina. And people from Halych came, took their dead prince and carried him to Halych and buried him in a church.\\" According to the later \\"Chronica Poloniae Maioris\\" Valentin Yanin; L. M. Popova, N. I. Shchaveleva, \\"Velikaia khronika\\" o Polshe, Rusi i iMoscow University, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/475f2cee70e26a32a19afeb4da09e526.html OCLC 22324865) Roman \\"refuses to pay the tribute to Leszek, bravely challenges him and with amassing the large force unexpectedly invades into the Polish lands. As Leszek found that out, he assembled a small troop rushed to meet him in Zawichost, fiercely attacks him, captures and defeats. Of the Ruthenians, that initially came arrogantly, many were wounded, very many killed with prince Roman, and the others, seeing [that] tried to find the rescue escaping, and many pathetically ended their lives in the Vistula [...] And so happened in 1205 AD.\\"kh sosediakh, XI-XIII vv.] (The Great Chronicle of Poland, Rus' and their neighbours). Many of the Rus' drowned and many more died at the hands of the local population, as Polish troops chased them all the way to Vladimir. Few survived the massacre and at the order of Leszek and Konrad, Roman's body was buried in Sandomierz. The two factions came to an agreement and the Russians released all their prisoners and paid 1,000 silver marks to recover the body of Roman, which was then buried in Vladimir. Aftermath After his triumph, Leszek's reputation took a positive turn, earning him credibility and the trust of Krak√≥w,The Annals of Jan D≈Çugosz p. 155 which would give him temporary power over the city. Konrad, coming of age, asked for his share of power and at the meditation of their mother and a selected group of aristocrats, the two brothers divide the country under their authority. Rus' turned unstable from its internal conflicts and the country is invaded by Lithuanians, this being the first time the Poles hear of that name. The Ruthenians suffered great casualties, but managed to defeat the invaders. In 1208, the country fell into civil war.The Annals of Jan D≈Çugosz p. 156 Footnotes References *D≈Çugosz, Jan.

In many Commonwealth countries, the full version is superintendent of police (SP). The rank is also used in most British Overseas Territories and in many former British colonies. In some countries, such as Italy, the rank of superintendent is a low rank.

Some officers also hold the rank of detective chief superintendent (though this is seldom used) and detective superintendent. Superintendents wear an epaulette bearing one pip below a crown, the same rank badge as a lieutenant-colonel and wear police caps with a laurel wreath across the brim to indicate seniority. = Canada = In Canada, the rank of superintendent is usually the next senior rank up from inspector. Some police forces also have the higher rank of staff superintendent (senior staff superintendent) or regional superintendent. = Hong Kong = Hong Kong Police Force ranks are based on the British system: *Chief superintendent ‚Äì in command of a branch or district formation *Senior superintendent ‚Äì second in charge of a district or commander of a bureau *Superintendent ‚Äì in command of HQ unit or police division = India = In India, a superintendent of police (SP) or deputy commissioner of police (DCP) heads the police force of a district or is incharge of a large urban or rural area in a district. Their rank badge is the state emblem above no star or one star. The rank below it is assistant deputy commissioner of police (A.DCP) or deputy superintendent of police (Dy.SP), while the rank above it is senior superintendent of police (SSP) or deputy commissioner of police. In the state of Kerala, superintendents of police in charge of districts are called District Police chiefs. = Ireland = In the Republic of Ireland the rank of superintendent is between inspector and chief superintendent. There are usually two or three assigned to each division. Detectives use the \\"detective\\" prefix. There were 178 superintendents in the Garda S√≠och√°na at the beginning of 2006. In the Irish language, a Garda superintendent is a ceannfort, which translates literally as \\"headman\\". Ard-Cheannfort is a chief superintendent or \\"high headman\\". Ceannfort is also used for the military rank of \\"commandant\\", equivalent to major. Each police district is commanded by a superintendent. Districts are sub-units of divisions, which are commanded by chief superintendents. = Italy = In the Italian Polizia di Stato, the ranks of superintendent (sovrintendente) are medium-level non-commissioned officers' ranks, senior to agents and assistants and junior to inspectors. In official comparisons, they are equivalent to sergeants. The three ranks are vice sovrintendente (deputy superintendent), sovrintendente (superintendent), and sovrintendente capo (chief superintendent). = Macau = Superintendent general and superintendent are, respectively, the ranks of the commander and deputy commanders of the Public Security Police (CPSP) of Macau. The rank of superintendent is senior to the rank of intendent. The CPSP rank insignia follows the generic model of the Portuguese Public Security Police, with the insignia of senior officers consisting in epaulets that contain two crossed horsewhips inside a laurel wreath and PSP stars (six points silver star with the \\"SP\\" monogram in the center) whose number defines the precise rank. The number of stars in the insignia of superintendent general and superintendent are, respectively, four and three. The rank insignia of superintendent general and superintendent are also distinguished in being in red epaulets instead of the dark blue of the other ranks. = New Zealand = In New Zealand, the rank of superintendent is above inspector and below assistant commissioner. Superintendents are typically appointed as district commanders, and the rank is also held by the commandant of the Royal New Zealand Police College. = Pakistan = In Pakistan, a senior superintendent of police is the head of the district police. Some districts and police divisions are commanded by superintendents of police. The police service of Pakistan now identifies a new hierarchy including DPO, CCPO etc. Superintendent of police is equivalent to DPO (district police officer) and can be a CSP belonging to PSP and can also be a ranker. = Papua New Guinea = In the Royal Papua New Guinea Constabulary, the rank of superintendent is above chief inspector and below chief superintendent. = Philippines = In the Philippines, superintendent is a rank in the Philippine National Police, the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology, and the Bureau of Fire Protection. It is above chief inspector and below senior superintendent and is regarded as the equivalent of lieutenant colonel in the Philippine Army. = Portugal = In Portugal, superintendent () is an officer rank in the Public Security Police (PSP). It is senior to the police rank of intendant and inferior to the rank of chief superintendent, being roughly equivalent to a colonel in the military. Superintendents usually exercise the role of commanding officers of district commands or the role of second-in-command in the metropolitan and regional commands. The rank insignia of a superintendent consists of a dark blue epaulet with two crossed horsewhips inside a laurel wreath and three PSP stars arranged in an inverted triangle. Each PSP star consists in a six-point silver star with the \\"SP\\" monogram in the center. = Singapore = In Singapore, the rank is used in both the police (SPF) and immigration authorities (ICA) as both use the same rank structure. In the police, there are three ranks of superintendent: assistant superintendent of police (ASP), deputy superintendent of police (DSP), and superintendent of police (SP). These three ranks fall under the senior police officer category. = South Africa = Pre-Union The rank was introduced in 1825, for the head of the Cape Town police. It was discontinued in 1860. It was also used in the short-lived Griqualand Mounted Police from 1873 to 1880 and in the Natal Police from 1894 to 1913, the Transvaal Town Police from 1901 to 1908, the Transvaal Police from 1908 to 1913, and the Orange River Colony Police from 1908 to 1913. Post-Union The rank reappeared in the Union of South Africa as the rank of the head of the South African Railways & Harbours Police in 1944. It was equivalent to the military rank of colonel, with the same rank insignia. From 1946, there were three grades: chief superintendent (brigadier), deputy chief superintendent (colonel), and superintendent (lieutenant-colonel). The police titles were replaced by the military titles in the 1960s. The title was reinstated for the South African Police Service in 1995. There were two grades: senior superintendent (equivalent to colonel) and superintendent (lieutenant- colonel). The police titles were replaced by the military titles in 2010. =Sri Lanka= In Sri Lanka, superintendent of police (SP) is a senior gazetted officer rank senior to assistant superintendent of police and junior to senior superintendent of police. The later was created in the 1980s. Superintendents are typically appointed as regional commanders of police divisions. = United Kingdom = The rank of superintendent is senior to chief inspector and junior to chief superintendent. The rank badge is a crown worn on the epaulettes, the same as a major in the British Army.  Metropolitan Police  The rank of superintendent was introduced at the foundation of the Metropolitan Police in 1829. Each division was commanded by a superintendent. The rank below superintendent was originally inspector until the introduction of chief inspector in 1868. Originally, only the commissioners held a higher rank than superintendent (and they were not sworn police officers). In 1839, Captain William Hay was appointed to the new rank of inspecting superintendent, replaced by assistant commissioner in 1856. The rank of district superintendent was introduced between superintendent and assistant commissioner in 1869, and was renamed chief constable in 1886. The rank of superintendent was also adopted in the Detective Branch (later the Criminal Investigation Department) from 1868, when Adolphus Williamson, the first head of the branch, was promoted to the rank. In 1949, Metropolitan Police superintendents were regraded to the new rank of chief superintendent, chief inspectors were regraded to superintendent, and sub-divisional inspectors and divisional detective inspectors were regraded to chief inspector (with those ranks being abolished). In September 1953, there was another change, when the rank was split into superintendent grade I (current superintendents, chief inspectors commanding sub-divisions and detective chief inspectors commanding divisional CIDs) and superintendent grade II (other current chief inspectors), with a redefined rank of chief inspector being created for senior inspectors.Report of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis for the Year 1953 Superintendents grade II wore the crown (the rank badge formerly worn by chief inspectors), with superintendents grade I wearing a crown over a pip (the rank badge formerly worn by superintendents). This lasted until 1974, when superintendent once more became a single rank, wearing a crown on the epaulettes. From January 1954 there was one superintendent grade I and one chief inspector in each sub-division, one chief superintendent, one superintendent grade II and one detective superintendent grade I in each division, and one commander, one deputy commander, one detective chief superintendent, and one detective superintendent grade II in each district. A detective chief inspector was added in each division later in 1954.Report of the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis for the Year 1954  Other British forces  In most other forces, superintendent lay between inspector and assistant chief constable until well into the 20th century. In many smaller forces, the senior superintendent was also the ACC. Some forces had chief inspectors, and some later acquired chief superintendents, but this was by no means universal. Today, however, every force in the country has all three ranks.  Salary  A superintendent's starting salary as of 2017 is ¬£61,291 rising to ¬£76,854 after 5 years. These salaries may be affected by regional and competency pay allowances. = United States = In the United States, superintendent is the title used for the head of certain police departments, such as the New Jersey State Police, Police Command Staff New York State Police, Massachusetts State Police, Chicago Police Department, New Orleans Police Department, Ohio State Highway Patrol, Missouri State Highway Patrol, Oregon State Police, and Indiana State Police. In some police departments, superintendent is instead the title used to describe a position with responsibilities that would be given in other police departments to bureau or division chiefs, with examples being the Cambridge Police Department, Boston Police Department and Dayton, Ohio Police Department.

By the time David was twenty (in 1885), it is believed he was already doing business under his own name. By 1888 he was making musical instruments. By 1904 his business had grown to become a small instrument factory. After his death the factory kept the name of Ernst David, but was owned by his son Albert David. The instrument company specialized in making brass instruments, many of which were used by Posaunen (brass horns) choirs in Protestant congregations in Germany and beyond. Johannes Kuhlo collaborated with Ernst David to develop the Kuhlohorn for use by Posaunen choirs. Some Ernst David instruments are still in regular use. Several examples can be found in musical instrument collections. Presently it is not clear when the instrument factory stopped operating; most likely it was during World War II.

The player is in control of a host of characters with the goal of uniting Sub-Roman Britain under a single king and defending the kingdom. The game was followed by the sequel Vengeance of Excalibur in 1991. Gameplay DOS screenshot showing a portion of Britain on the map screen Screenshot of a \\"scene level\\": a group of knights of the Round Table (left) meets some evil knights (right) The geographical setting for Spirit of Excalibur is a depiction of actual southern England with its cities, castles, villages, churches and other locations scattered throughout the land. The player starts by controlling a single character, Lord Constantine III of Britain, but as the game proceeds he will be able to control many other knights and the armies they lead, including King Arthur's best friend and magician Merlin. All action takes place at two different levels: a so-called \\"map level\\" and a \\"scene level\\". As its name implies, the \\"map level\\" shows a multi-screen overview map of Britain, which the player can explore by scrolling. The computer- and player-controlled characters move across the map from place to place and are usually marked by a shield icon with the knight or character's own insignia. To solve the puzzles and mysteries which allow him to proceed through the game, the player must visit key locations and interact with various characters, sometimes enlisting their help and sometimes fighting them. These types of action take place at the \\"scene level\\". When two different groups meet, the player is shown a scene depicting a side view of all characters present at that location. Dialogs, individual combat, exchanges of objects, and requests for information all take place at the scene level. During the fights on this level, one of the player controlled characters combats one of the enemies. The fight ends when all the elements of a group are dead or have withdrawn. The player can choose whether to activate an automatic control or fight manually and he can also have any of his characters use an object or a magician cast a spell. Individual combat ensues between characters who are not supported by an army, but upon a meeting between two hostile armies a specific combat screen opens. If the player has control over one of the two sides, he can issue commands to his units, for example ordering a group of soldiers to charge the enemy, some knights to flank the adversary of have one of the Knights of the Round Table use an object. All characters have specific characteristics listed in a status display: numerical values identify the character health status, his/her magical or combat abilities, the strength of his/her defences and the nobility and faith levels. While combat skill or health level are quite self-explanatory, nobility and faith play a slightly subtle role: these virtues are fundamental to each character, so much that extremely low levels of nobility or faith will have the specific knight turn evil and the player will lose control over such character. The player can lower a knight's nobility value for example by committing inappropriate actions for a noble (e.g. attacking innocent people), but he can also enhance such value by committing good deeds like helping a damsel in distress. Faith values can be altered quite similarly: in presence of supernatural creatures or tools faith can be reduced, but having a character spend some time in a church will make his/her faith stronger. Plot As the title suggests, the game is based on Arthurian legend. Both fictional and historical sources are used to recreate the atmosphere of the age of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, and to draw out characters' names, history and relationships. The game's sources include medieval works such as Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur, modern ones such as Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon, and a number of historical treatises on Arthur of the late 1980s. The game is set in the year 539, shortly after the Battle of Camlann at which King Arthur has been mortally wounded by the traitorous Mordred. Britain urgently needs a new king who can reunite its scattered realms and bring the Round Table back to its former glory. Arthur left a successor in the person of Lord Constantine the Crown Regent. Spirit of Excalibur consists of five different episodes each with its main quest and a number of lesser ones to solve both to achieve the episode main goal and the game aim of reuniting Britain. During the game the player first leads Constantine to Camelot where he can claim Arthur's throne, then gathers forces to defeat both the Saxon invaders and the sons of Mordred who seek to usurp the throne just as their father did. As the game progresses, enchanted beings threaten Constantine's kingdom and the player must find the magical means to stop these menaces as well, up to the final confrontation with Arthur's half-sister Morgan le Fay who is dabbling in dark arts. The game is won if the player can unite all the fragmented kingdoms of Britain and successfully keep Constantine alive past the last episode. Reception Computer Gaming World praised Excaliburs VGA graphics and described it as a \\"technical wonder\\", but criticized the documentation and game for not explaining the goal. The DOS version of the game received 4 out of 5 stars in Dragon. Amiga reviews were varied from average to very positive and included the scores of 70% in Amiga Action, 62% in Amiga Power, and 83% in Zero. Sequel The sequel was developed also by Synergistic Software and published by Virgin Games for the Amiga, Atari ST, DOS and Macintosh computers in 1991. It begins after Morgan has been slain and all her evil magic was undone, which also means the demon lord Shadowmaster was set free and becomes the powerful new main antagonist.

It was the first post-war Polish electric locomotive, designed in 1955. Besides being delivered for PKP, ET21 locomotives were delivered to the mining industry, where they are used up to now. History Mechanical part of the locomotive was designed in the Rolling-stock Industry Central Bureau of Construction (Pl.: Centralne Biuro Konstrukcyjne Przemys≈Çu Taboru Kolejowego) in Pozna≈Ñ, basing on instructions from the Railway Electrification Office (Pl.: Biuro Elektryfikacji Kolei). Electrical part of ET21 locomotive was slightly based on Soviet VL22M locomotive. Production started in 1957 at Pafawag in Wroc≈Çaw in co-operation with Dolmel (Wroc≈Çaw), Elta (≈Å√≥d≈∫), Elester (≈Å√≥d≈∫) and Apena (Bielsko-Bia≈Ça) companies. After first two units (prototypes) were ready the serial production started. At the beginning those locomotives bore E600 designation, which was changed to E06 and after introducing RN-58/MK0001 norm to present ET21. By the end of 1958 18 new machines were ready. After producing 70 first units and gaining significant experience Pafawag decided to introduce several technical changes into locomotives. This included decreasing weight by approx. 8 t., levelling weight on all axles, changing air intake system and crew cabin as well as installing electric carriage heating system. First locomotives were introduced into Warsaw-Katowice-Gliwice line. As the number of engines was increasing they started serving on all electrified lines in Poland. After the introduction of the EU06 and EU07 locomotives, the ET21 was systematically transferred to freight only service. Systematical withdrawal of this series began on the brink of the 1980s and 1990s and lasts until today. Some units are still used on mountainous areas, especially on Tarn√≥w-Krynica-Zdr√≥j, Krak√≥w-Zakopane and Wroc≈Çaw-Wa≈Çbrzych lines. The only running first-series ET21 locomotive is ET21-57 machine located in Chab√≥wka railway museum. Service outside PKP 3E-005 locomotive used in mining industry Along with delivering locomotives for PKP Pafawag started selling machines for mining industry, specifically for Coal Mining Filling Materials Company (Pl.: Przedsiƒôbiorstwo Materia≈Ç√≥w Podsadzkowych Przemys≈Çu Wƒôglowego - PMP-PW). Those locomotives bore designation 3E - first series and 3E/1 - second, modernised series. The first locomotive delivered for PMP-PW was given 3E-10 number, the last one bore 3E/1-77 number. The main difference between PKP ET21 and 3E locomotives was that coal mining locomotives were lacking in carriage heating systems. 3E and 3E/1 machines were and are still used for transporting filling sand, power plant waste and coal, especially in Upper Silesia region. It is quite common to use those locomotives in couples, with one of them pulling and the other pushing the train. In the years 1973-1980 PKP borrowed several items of 3E/1 locomotives and changed their designation to ET21 with adding additional 9 figure to serial number. Such locomotives were running for PKP for over two years. In exchange PKP sold in the 1980s 14 units of ET21 locomotives to the industry. Those locomotives remained named ET21 but additional 1 figure was added to serial number. Technical data ET21 is a Co-Co electric locomotive, suited for pulling freight trains weighing up to 2500 t. with top speed of 65 km/h or passenger trains with top speed of 100 km/h. =Engines= The locomotive is equipped with six LKb-635 (though some sources give LKa-635) engines which are mounted on the bogies with a tram system. The engines propel the axles with an 85:24 transmission. There are three ways of connecting the engines: series connection (all six engines in one series), series-parallel connection (three engines in one series - two groups) and parallel-series connection (two engines in one series - three groups).[9] Four-step reduction of engine excitation (up to 50%) is made by bypassing parts of main pole's windings with shunts and resistors. Shunts and resistors are in parallel connection with main pole's winding. Each engine has four steel main poles, isolated with varnish and four commutation poles made of one steel block. =Bogies= A Co‚Ä≤Co‚Ä≤ type of the locomotive means it is equipped with two bogies, each of them having three axles with separate propulsion for each wheel set. Bogies are coupled with each other. Box is supported on bogies with three slides. Middle slide supports it chassis in horizontal position during start and braking. =Body= The body and chassis are completely welded construction with crew compartments on both ends. It contains two machine compartments and one high voltage compartment. Moving between crew cabins is enabled by 570 mm wide corridor running along the box wall. machine compartments are reached through the doors in the back walls of crew compartments. Both crew compartments are equipped in exactly the same way. It includes switch board, hand-brake and electric cooker on the left-hand side, drive controller, direction controller and brakes valves on the right- hand side. Air manometers and Hasler type train event recorder are mounted in front of the engineer's place. SHP (automatic train brake) button is located next to drive controller. Windscreens are equipped with 150W heater used during winter. Additional, 300W heater is located under the dashboard in order to heat crew's legs, but this was installed only in modernised 3E/1 version. Crew compartment A has washbasin and clothes locker installed. Sound horn and sander buttons are located on the floor. In the wall of machine compartments large blinds are used as air intakes. On the opposite side, along the corridor rectangular blins are mounted between windows. Locomotives of 3E series have three windows on each side whilst 3E/1 locomotives have two windows on the side of machine compartments and three windows on the corridor side. There are compressors and blowers on the floors of machine compartments and two air tanks, 220 liters each, are mounted under the roof. In a non-modernised machine battery box was installed in A crew compartment whilst in a modernised version batteries were placed inside machine compartments. Air tank for raising the pantograph is located in B crew compartment. All high voltage devices and resistors are located inside high voltage compartment. In modernised version of ET21 locomotive this is placed in the middle part of the box. It is possible to completely remove the framework of high voltage compartment. Locomotive's roof is divided into several parts and over the high voltage compartment it is removable.

It was established in about 1561, and was suppressed in 1793. It is known for a Bible translation referred to as the Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible. Of over 300 priests from Douai sent on the English mission, about one-third were executed. The dissolution of the college at the time of the French Revolution led to the founding of Crook Hall near Lanchester in County Durham (which became St. Cuthbert's College), and St Edmund's College, Ware. It is popularly believed that the indemnification funds paid by the French for the seizure of Douai's property were diverted by the British commissioners to complete the furnishings of George IV's Royal Pavilion at Brighton. History Colleges at University of Douai =University of Douai= As part of a general programme of consolidation of the Spanish Low Countries, in 1560‚Äì1562, Philip II of Spain established a university in Douai that was in some sense a sister-university to that founded at Louvain in 1426. The University of Douai has emerged in recent studies as an important institution of its time. Of an avowedly Catholic character, it had five faculties: theology, canon and civil law, medicine, and arts. In the early years there was a strong English influence, with several of the chief posts being held by professors who had fled Oxford University after the accession of Protestants in England. It was there, too, that after taking his licentiate in 1560, William Allen from Lancashire became Regius Professor of Divinity. =An English college= The foundation of this university coincided with the presence of a large number of English Catholics living at Douai, in the wake of the accession of Elizabeth I and the restoration of Protestantism in England. These included the university's first chancellor, Richard Smith, who had studied at Oxford and thus had already brought the new university under Oxford influences. It was William Allen who first had the idea for a seminary for English Catholic priests, with studies linked to those of the university. He had the idea in a conversation with Dr. Jean Vendeville, then Regius Professor of Canon Law in the University of Douai and later Bishop of Tournai (Allen and Vendeville went on a pilgrimage to Rome together in autumn 1567). The foundation began to take definite shape when Allen leased a house at Douai on Michaelmas Day 1568 with six initial students.\\"The English College at Douai\\", Ushaw Similar colleges also came about at Douai for Scottish and Irish Catholic clergy, and also Benedictine, Franciscan and Jesuit houses. Ward, Bernard. \\"Douai.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 5. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 17 February 2018 The aim of Allen and the college was to gather together some of the many English Catholics living in exile in different countries of the continent and provide them with facilities for continuing their studies (in what was effectively a Catholic University of Oxford in exile), thus producing a ready-made stock of educated English Catholic clergy ready for England's re-conversion to Catholicism (expected by Allen in the near future). At the same time the college was the first of the type of seminary ordered by the Council of Trent, and so received papal approval shortly after its establishment. It was also taken under the protection of King Philip II of Spain, who assigned it an annual grant of 200 ducats. Other seminaries or houses of study on the European continent for the training of priests from and for England and Wales (all known typically as English Colleges) included ones in Rome (from 1579), Valladolid (from 1589), Seville (from 1592) and Lisbon (from 1628). Nevertheless, in the early years Allen's college had no regular income and was reliant on private donations from England and the generosity of a few local friends (especially the neighbouring monasteries of Saint-Vaast at Arras, Anchin, and Marchiennes, which, at the suggestion of Dr. Vendeville, had from time to time subscribed towards the work). Allen continued his own theological studies and, after taking his doctorate, became Regius Professor at the university, though he donated his whole salary to the college to keep it afloat. A few years after the foundation Allen applied to Pope Gregory XIII for regular funding. In 1565, Gregory granted the college a monthly pension of 100 golden crowns per month, which continued to be paid down to the time of the French Revolution. Only a few years after foundation, Allen's personality and influence had attracted more than 150 students to the college. A steady stream of controversial works issued from Douai, some by Allen himself, others by such men as Thomas Stapleton and Richard Bristow. It was at the English College at Douai that the English translation of the Bible known as the Douay‚ÄìRheims Bible was completed in 1609. However, the college did see opposition from the university and town, with all the English at Douai expelled in 1578 and the college finding a temporary base at Rheims.Schofield, Nicholas. \\"From Douay to Allen Hall\\", Diocese of Westminster The College did hold onto the house at Douai, however, and returned to it in 1593 (though without Allen, who had been called to reside in Rome, where he died on 16 October 1594). =Douai martyrs= When the open re-conversion of England did not materialise (since the Marian Catholic bishops were dead, imprisoned or in exile, and the Catholic priests who had stayed in England were dying out or converting to Protestantism), the college began to supply missionary priests or \\"seminary priests\\" to enter England covertly, minister to existing Catholics and attempt re-conversion. Operating as a Catholic priest was legally high treason at the time (with the penalty of being hanged, drawn and quartered), and of the over 300 priests Douai sent into England by the end of the 16th century, more than 130 (mainly the secular clergy, known as the Douai Martyrs) are known to have been executed,\\"Remembering the English College at Douai\\", Jesuits in Britain, 1 October 2018 with many more imprisoned and nearly 160 banished back to the continent. In 1577 Cuthbert Mayne became the first of them to be martyred. Back in Douai, the college was granted a special privilege of singing a solemn Mass of thanksgiving each time news reached them of another martyrdom of a Douai priest. =17th and 18th centuries= Under Allen's successor, Dr. Richard Barrett, the work was extended to include a preparatory course in humanities, so that it became a school as well as a college. In 1603 under Dr. Thomas Worthington, the third president, a regular college was built, opposite the old parish church of St-Jacques, in the Rue des Morts, so called on account of the adjoining cemetery. The town at that time formed a single parish, whereas in the 18th century it was to be divided into four parishes, and the present church of St-Jacques dates from that time. Blessed Arthur Bell, the Franciscan, taught Hebrew at Douai in the 1620s. Disputes occurred between the secular priests and regular priests in the 17th century similar to the disputes affecting English Catholic affairs in general. Dr. Worthington, though himself a secular priest, was under the influence of the Jesuit Father Parsons, and for a long time the students attended the Jesuit schools and all the spiritual direction was in Jesuit hands. A visitation of the college, however, found many shortcomings in its administration and in the end Worthington was replaced as president by Matthew Kellison (1631‚Äì1641), who succeeded in restoring the reputation of the college and gradually arranged for instruction to be given once again by the college itself rather than the Jesuits. In the latter half of the 17th century and the early years of the 18th century, the English College went through a troubled time. During the presidency of Dr. Hyde (1646‚Äì1651), the University of Douai obtained certain controlling rights over the college, but Hyde successfully withstood these. His successor, Dr. George Leyburn (1652‚Äì1670), fell out with the body of secular priests in England known as the \\"Old Chapter\\", which in the absence of a bishop, was governing the Catholic Church in England. Leyburn attacked Thomas White, alias Blacklo, a prominent member of the \\"Old Chapter\\", and arranged a condemnation of his writings by the University of Douai. (In the meantime Douai had been captured by the French in 1677.) In the end, however, Leyburn himself found it necessary to retire in favour of his nephew, Dr. John Leyburn, who was afterwards Vicar Apostolic in England. Hardly was the dispute with the \\"Blackloists\\" finished, when a further storm of an even more serious nature arose, the centre being Dr. Hawarden who was professor of philosophy and then of theology at the English College for seventeen years. His reputation became so great that when a vacancy occurred in 1702 he was solicited by the bishop, the chief members of the university, and the magistrates of the town to accept the post of Regius professor of divinity. His candidature, however, was opposed by a party headed by the vice- chancellor. The Jesuits also declared against him, accusing him, and through him the English College, of Jansenism. In the end, Dr. Hawarden retired from Douai and went on the mission in England; and a visitation of the college, made by order of the Holy See, resulted in completely clearing him of the accusation.Rudge, F.M. \\"Edward Hawarden.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 17 January 2019 Douai became ever more important to English Catholics when their hopes of England returning to Catholicism were finally ended by the defeat of the Jacobite risings. Under the presidency of Dr. Robert Witham (1715‚Äì1738) the English College at Douai was rebuilt on a substantial scale and rescued from the overwhelming debt into which it had been plunged when it lost nearly all its endowment in the notorious \\"South Sea Bubble\\". =French Revolution= Postcard circa 1910 depicting the building that housed the English College at the time of its dissolution in 1793. As a town Douai suffered less than many others at the beginning of the French Revolution and at first the university and its associated colleges held onto its Catholic character, but during the Reign of Terror it suffered the same fate as many similar establishments. When all the clergy of the town were called upon in 1791 to take the \\"Civic Oath\\", the members of the British establishments claimed exemption in virtue of their nationality. The plea was allowed for a time but, when Louis XVI was executed and Britain declared war, the superiors and students of most of the other British establishments realised their immunity was at an end and fled to England. The members of the English College, with their president, Rev. John Daniel, remained in the hope of saving the college. However, in October, 1793, they were taken to prison at Doullens in Picardy, together with six Anglo- Benedictine monks who had remained for a similar purpose, and Dr. Stapleton (President of St Omer) and his students. After suffering in prison, the English Collegians were allowed to return to Douai in November 1794 and a few months later Stapleton managed to gain their release and permission to return to England, though the college would never return to Douai.\\"Douai (1568)\\", Allen Hall In England, the Penal Laws had recently been repealed, and they founded two colleges to continue the college's work, at Crook Hall, County Durham (afterwards removed to Ushaw College, County Durham) in the North and St Edmund's College, Old Hall, at Ware, Hertfordshire in the South. The Roman pension was divided equally between these two until the French occupied Rome in 1799, when it ceased to be paid. After the evacuation of the English students in 1793, the building that housed the college was converted to military barracks and named after Douai native and war hero Pierre Fran√ßois Joseph Durutte (1767‚Äì1827). It remained a military barracks until it was leveled in 1926. Subsequent excavation of the grounds revealed buried relics, including the body of Father John Southworth (1592‚Äì1654), an alumnus who had been martyred for his faith. Brighton banqueting room After the Revolution, Bonaparte united all the British establishments in France under one administrator, Rev Francis Walsh, an Irishman. On the Bourbon Restoration, a large sum of money was paid to the British Government to indemnify those who had suffered by the Revolution, though none of this reached the Catholics. It was ruled that as the Catholic colleges were carried on in France for the sole reason that they were illegal in England, they must be considered French, not English, establishments, though the buildings were restored to their rightful owners. An old tradition, considered credible by antiquarian Joseph Gillow, holds that the funds were diverted to complete the furnishings of George IV's Royal Pavilion at Brighton.Gillow, Joseph. \\"Douai college and the Brighton Pavilion\\", The Athenaeum, No.3199, February 16, 1889, p. 215 With the laws of separation of Church and State implemented in 1905, all the property of the English Benedictines was confiscated by the French state. The community thus returned to England, reestablishing its monastery and school at Woolhampton in Berkshire, in proximity to London.

They are migratory, wintering south of their breeding ranges in Central America, the West Indies or South America. The three species are: * Hooded warbler, Wilsonia citrina * Wilson's warbler, Wilsonia pusilla * Canada warbler, Wilsonia canadensis The hooded warbler is now included in Setophaga, while Wilson's and Canada are included in Cardellina. Wilsonia warblers are long. They have yellow underparts and black head markings in at least the adult male plumage. Two species have plain olive green-brown back, but the Canada warbler has grey upperparts and is also migrates much further than the other species in the genus. The breeding habitat is broadleaved woodlands with dense undergrowth. These birds nest low in a bush or on the ground, laying 3‚Äì6 eggs in a cup nest. Wilsonia warblers feed on insects, often caught by flycatching, and they have distinctive songs and loud chip calls. Taxonomy Some authorities suggest that the genus Wilsonia should include the red-faced warbler, which is generally put in the genus Cardellina. Recent genetic research has however suggested that the type species of Wilsonia (hooded warbler W. citrina) and of Setophaga (American redstart S. ruticilla) are closely related and should be merged into the same genus. As the name Setophaga (published in 1827) takes priority over Wilsonia (published in 1838), hooded warbler would then be transferred as Setophaga citrina. Where this is accepted, the other two Wilsonia species are then transferred to their next-most closely related genus, Cardellina.Lovette, I. J. et al. (2010).

The eighth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, and the first hurricane of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season, Debby developed from a tropical wave off the west coast of the Yucatan Peninsula on August 31. The system slowly intensified as it tracked west- northwestward toward Mexico, eventually reaching tropical storm status on September 2\\\\. Thereafter, Debby began to rapidly strengthen, and the storm was upgraded to a hurricane later that day. After attaining peak winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), Debby made landfall near Tuxpan, Veracruz, in Mexico early on September 3\\\\. The hurricane quickly weakened inland, but managed to reach the eastern Pacific on September 5\\\\. Debby became Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, which moved northwest but remained poorly organized due to wind shear and dissipated on September 8\\\\. Heavy rainfall caused flooding in the state of Veracruz. Thousands of people were forced from their homes as rivers rose, including upwards of 30,000 fleeing for shelter after the Tuxpan River exceeded its bank. About 8,000 residents of the city of √Ålamo were rendered homeless. Flooding in Poza Rica forced the rescue of dozens of people from their cars and homes. Several homes in the city were swept away, while debris such as tree branches and trash blocked water runoff. Water, mudslides, and rocks blocked numerous roads in the area. In combination with Hurricane Kristy in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 50,000 people were left homeless in Mexico. At least 20 fatalities were attributed to Debby. Meteorological history A relatively strong tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the northwest coast of Africa on August 15\\\\. Moving westward, the wave split while well east of the Lesser Antilles, with a portion developing into Tropical Depression Seven on August 21, which eventually strengthened into Tropical Storm Chris. The remaining portion of the wave continued westward and reached the Caribbean Sea as a disorganized center of showers. During the night of August 29, some cloud banding developed, followed by the formation of a low-level center over the Yucat√°n Peninsula on August 30\\\\. Shortly after entering the Bay of Campeche on August 31, the system was given a T1.5 rating on the Dvorak scale, based on appearance on satellite imagery. As a result, the wave developed into Tropical Depression Eight at 18:00 UTC on August 31\\\\. Cloud banding and outflow patterns became further organized on September 1\\\\. The depression moved generally west-northwestward, steered by a high pressure area situated over the Eastern United States. On September 2, the depression organized significantly. Based on a reconnaissance aircraft flight and satellite imagery, it is estimated that the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Debby around 06:00 UTC. Later that day, another reconnaissance flight observed sustained winds of at and at the surface of the storm. At 18:00 UTC on September 2, Debby became a Category 1 hurricane while centered only about offshore Mexico. Six hours later, Debby made landfall about south of Tuxpan, Veracruz, with winds of 75 mph (120 km/h) - the highest sustained wind speed associated with the storm. Debby was the first hurricane to strike the state of Veracruz since Hurricane Anna in 1956. Additionally, Debby simultaneously attained its minimum barometric pressure of . The hurricane rapidly weakened over the Sierra Madre Oriental mountains of Mexico, weakening to a tropical storm by 06:00 UTC on September 3 and falling to tropical depression intensity about 12 hours later. However, the circulation managed to remain intact and reached the Pacific Ocean between Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta on September 5. Tropical Depression Seventeen-E on September 7 Operationally, the National Hurricane Center treated the storm as a new tropical cyclone, rather than a continuation of Debby. As a result, the system became Tropical Depression Seventeen-E, with advisories beginning at 21:00 UTC after the \\"remnants\\" of Debby became organized enough to be classified as such. Little movement occurred, with the depression remaining stationary off the coast of Manazillo. Although the depression was a poorly-organized cyclone, the possibility that it could re-intensify into a tropical storm in the small and narrow Gulf of California existed. However, due to the depression's proximity to land and increasing wind shear, the chances of the system strengthening into a tropical storm again became doubtful. By September 7, the depression was under the influence of a low-level trough and weak steering currents. The depression soon became difficult to track via satellite imagery. Most of the deep convection and outflow diminished by September 8, reducing the system to a low-level swirl. The depression dissipated around 18:00 UTC, while situated in the Gulf of California between La Paz, Baja California Sur, and Culiac√°n, Sinaloa. Preparations and impact Multiple tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in accordance with Hurricane Debby. The first was a tropical storm warning for Santa Cruz to the city of Veracruz at 12:00 UTC on September 2\\\\. About four hours later, the portion of the tropical storm warning from Santa Cruz to Punta Jerez. The remaining portion of the tropical storm warnings - from Punta Jerez to Veracruz - was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 18:30 UTC on September 2\\\\. The portions of the hurricane warning between Cabo Rojo and Punta Jerez as well as from Poza Rica to Veracruz were downgraded to a tropical storm warning at 22:00 UTC. All watches and warnings were discontinued at 02:30 UTC on September 3. In the city of Tuxpan, the police, Mexican Army, and Red Cross were placed on standby. Rainfall totals from Hurricane Debby in Mexico Locally heavy flooding was reported in Tuxpan. Streets were inundated and power outages occurred, while more than 500 people lost their homes. The Tuxpan River overflowed its banks at √Ålamo. A local Red Cross official stated that most of the town was submerged in only a few minutes. About 5,000 homes were flooded by September 3, forcing approximately 30,000 people to flee. Additional flooding in the town resulted in about 8,000 people being left homeless. In Poza Rica, downed tree trunks and trash caused water runoffs to be blocked. Mud and rocks blocked roads and dozens were rescued from house and car flooding. A number of homes built along the gullies were washed away. The Cazones River overflowed, rendering a highway connecting Tampico to Veracruz impassable. The Cotaxtla River exceeded its bank in Cotaxtla, rupturing nine oil and natural gas lines. Pemex works quickly closed the pipelines. In Mexico City, about 600 people fled for shelter as rivers in the area began to swell. Ram√≥n Aguirre Vel√°zquez, the Head of Government of Mexico City, described the rainfall as the heaviest in 20 years. A total of 20 deaths were attributed to Hurricane Debby, with 10 fatalities in the state of Veracruz alone. Three were caused by a landslide in Papalanta that crushed two homes. Three other storm-related deaths were reported with house-crushing landslides in Poza Rica. Four people died and sixteen were injured in Ixtlahuaco - a town in Hidalgo about northeast of Mexico City - when a mudslide crushed three homes. The combined effects of Debby and Hurricane Kristy, which impacted Mexico's Pacific coast around the same time, rendered about 50,000 people homeless. Emergency crews worked to provide shelter for those left homeless. Relief supplies were delivered by boat to towns isolated by floodwaters. Local health officials in Mexico City warned of the possibility of outbreaks of hepatitis, typhoid, and other waterborne diseases. In response to the threat, homes located in the northern portions of the city near the R√≠o de los Remedios were fumigated.

The Governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the British government. The role of the Governor is to act as the de facto head of state, and he or she is responsible for appointing the Premier and the 11 members of the Senate (the upper house of Bermuda's Parliament). The Governor is also Commander-in-Chief of Bermuda, formerly in control of a large Bermuda Garrison composed of regular army, Militia, Volunteer, and Territorial units, of which only the Royal Bermuda Regiment remains. Until 1867, the Governor also held the appointment of Vice-Admiral of Bermuda. The current Governor is John Rankin; he was sworn in on 5 December 2016. The Governor has his own flag in Bermuda, a Union Flag with the territory's coat of arms superimposed. History Bermuda's settlement began in 1609, with the wrecking of the flagship of the Virginia Company, the Sea Venture. Although most of the passengers and crew ultimately completed their voyage to Virginia, the archipelago was permanently settled from that point, and left in the hands of the Virginia Company. The first intentional settlers arrived in 1612, under Richard Moore, whose appointment was officially as the Deputy Governor of Bermuda. Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as the first Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda. A carpenter by trade, Moore ensured the long-term survival of the colony by concentrating on building fortifications, including the first stone forts in the English New World, and developing St. George's Town. Moore brought with him to Bermuda two consecutively numbered boxes. The first, only to be opened in the case of his death, incapacitation or absence from the colony, contained the name of the settler who was to replace him. In the case of that settler also having died, or otherwise being incapable of taking the office, a second was named in the other box. More was also instructed to appoint a Counsell of Six to assist in the governance of the colony. The six appointed Counsellors were Captain Miles Kendall, Captain John Mansfield, Thomas Knight, Charles Caldycot, Edward Waters, and Christopher Carter (Carter was among three men who had first arrived in Bermuda with the 1609 wreck of the Sea Venture. He had remained behind with Robert Waters when the Deliverance and Patience had departed for Jamestown in 1610 with the remainder of the Sea Venture's passengers and crew, and remained again with Robert Waters and Edward Chard, after the Patience had returned from Jamestown and departed once more in the same year for England). Bermuda was the second permanent English colony established (as an extension of the first, Jamestown, Virginia). Bermuda was administered under Royal charters by the Virginia Company, and its successor, the Somers Isles Company, which appointed the colony's governors until the Crown revoked the charter and took over administration in 1684. With the transfer to the Somers Isles Company in 1615, Sir Thomas Smith remained in England as Governor and Treasurer of Bermuda, and Captain Daniel Tucker was sent to Bermuda in 1616 aboard the George, in consort with the Edwin, to succeed Moore as Deputy Governor. Twenty-four Assistants were also appointed. By the 1630s, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors to Bermuda and had begun appointing prominent Bermudians, such as William Sayle, to the position. The Crown maintained the system of government established under the company; an elected parliament (originally a single House of Assembly, which held is first session in 1620) which held its and a privy council under a governor. The Privy Council, made up of the Chief Justice, certain senior civil servants, and appointees, was also known as the Governor's Council and the Legislative Council (most of its responsibilities are now filled by the Cabinet and the Senate of Bermuda, with the Council now only an advisory body for the Governor). The last company- appointed Governor was reappointed by the Crown. In 1707 the British State was created by the union of the Kingdom of England with the Kingdom of Scotland, and Bermuda thereby became a British colony. Since the 1783 independence of Virginia, it has been Britain's oldest colony. Following US independence, Bermuda became an important Royal Navy base, with a large military garrison to guard it.\\"The Andrew and the Onions: The Story of the Royal Navy in Bermuda, 1795‚Äì1975\\", Lt. Commander Ian Strannack, The Bermuda Maritime Museum Press, The Bermuda Maritime Museum As such, the policy of the government until the closure of the Royal Naval dockyard in 1953 had been to appoint retiring Generals or Admirals as Bermuda's Governor and Commander-in-Chief. On the rare occasions when a civilian was appointed to the role, it was only as Governor ‚Äì the role of Commander-in-Chief being filled by a serving General or Admiral in Bermuda or Newfoundland. Since the 1950s, those appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief have tended to be prominent career-politicians at the ends of their political lives. Prior to the creation of the lower (and, originally, only) house of the Parliament of Bermuda, the House of Assembly, in 1620, the Governors ruled supreme, and were often draconian. Governor Daniel Tucker, formerly of Virginia, who arrived in 1616, was notorious for his harshness, having many islanders hanged, maimed, or whipped on the slightest provocation. One Bermudian, John Wood, was hanged for airing his views on the Governor in church. Governor Tucker's personal boat was reportedly stolen by five islanders, one named Saunders, who left a note saying they were on their way to England, or Davy Jones' Locker, either place being preferable to Bermuda under Tucker's rule. On reaching England, they complained about the harshness of Tucker's rule, though their complaints fell on deaf ears. Governor Tucker also, reportedly, used his oversight of the surveying of Bermuda to enrich himself and future generations of Bermudian Tuckers with prime real estate when he appropriated the overplus (surplus) land left after Richard Norwood's 1616 survey of the colony. Much of this land, forming an estate known as The Grove, would still be in the hands of his relatives during the American War of Independence. For the remainder of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the real political power in Bermuda lay in the elected parliament and the appointed Council, both dominated by members of Bermuda's wealthy commercial class. By the mid-Seventeenth Century, the Somers Isles Company had ceased sending Governors from overseas, and instead appointed Bermudians such as William Sayle from this same local elite; a policy which ended after the Civil Wars, during which Bermuda tended to the Royalist side. After the regicide, Bermuda was the first colony to recognize Charles II. With control of \\"the Army\\" (the local militia), the royalists ousted the Somers Isles Company's Governor, Captain Thomas Turner, and elected John Trimingham as their leader. Governors who were too high-handed or injudicious in the exercise of their office occasionally fell foul of the local political institutions. Governor Isaac Richier, who arrived in 1691, quickly made himself unpopular with his carousing and criminal behaviour. Bermudian complaints saw him placed in jail, and replaced by Governor Goddard. When Goddard proved worse than Richier, attorney general Samuel Trott had him jailed alongside Richier. The two governors were to be tried before a pair of prominent Bermudians, John Trimmingham and William Butterfield. After Trott called the amateur judges bush lawyers, however, he found himself in St. George's jail alongside the governors. After they confided in him their plan for escape, Trott informed the judges. Richier and Goddard were sent back to England for trial.\\"Bermuda in Three Colours\\", Carveth Wells. Robert M. McBride & Company, New York. 1935. St. George's to the City of Hamilton in 1815, and was replaced with the current building on the same grounds. At the written request of George Washington, during the course of the American War of Independence, 100 barrels of gunpowder were stolen from a magazine in St. George's and provided to the American rebels. No one was ever prosecuted in relation to this act of treason. The theft had been the result of a conspiracy involving powerful Bermudians, who were motivated as much by Bermuda's desperate plight, denied her primary trading partner and source of food, as by any favourable sentiments they may have had in regard to either the American colonists or their cause. The chief conspirator was Henry Tucker of The Grove (the overplus estate appropriated in 1616 by Governor Daniel Tucker), a Member of the House of Assembly, former Member of the Council, and Militia officer (soon to be promoted to Colonel), who had plotted with Benjamin Franklin while attending the rebel Continental Congress as a delegate for Bermuda. Two of his sons served in the rebel Army and were to achieve high office in the post-War US Government. A third son, also named Henry Tucker, was at the time the President of the Council (and later acting Governor on multiple occasions), and married to the daughter of Governor George James Bruere. Following this, Bermudians and their political institutions were looked at suspiciously by the British Government. Governor Lt. Gen. Sir Henry LeGuay Geary, KCB (right), at Prospect Camp, Bermuda, on Tuesday, the 11 March, 1902 to decorate three officers with the DSO With the buildup of the naval and military bases on the island following American independence, the position of the Governor was enhanced. Despite this, the Governors ‚Äì appointed by the Crown ‚Äì remained largely dependent on the Bermudian parliament to pass laws and to provide funds. This fact often found Governors pleading in vain for the required acts of parliament or money to carry out policies determined at Government House, or in London. This was particularly noticeable in the Bermudian Parliament's neglect to maintain militia, which (other than during the course of the American War of 1812), it allowed to become moribund after the build-up of the naval and military base began in 1795. Attempts to raise militias directly under the control of the Governor, without acts of the local parliament, ultimately failed because the parliament did not provide funds. In the 1860s, it became the policy of the British Government to reduce the costly professional military garrison in Bermuda. As it was not wished to leave the colony, seen more as a naval base, unguarded, this could only be done if the professional soldiers were replaced with part-time Volunteer units. Successive governors were set the task of convincing the Bermudian parliament to raise the required units, but, concerned of being saddled with the cost of maintaining the entire garrison, as well as with the possibility for social disruption that could be caused by raising either racially segregated or integrated units, the Bermudian Parliamentarians simply refused. This state of affairs continued until the Secretary of State for War found a lever (the Princess Hotel) to blackmail the Bermuda Parliament with in 1885, which resulted it finally passing acts in 1892 for the creation of militia and volunteer forces (although the units would be entirely funded by the British Government).\\"Defence, Not Defiance: A History of the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps\\", Jennifer M.

Itself using as a source the unique, typescript \\"History of The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps, 1891‚Äì1933\\", held at the Bermuda Library, in Hamilton. Struggles between the Governor and the Parliament would continue to recur. In 1939, the Governor, General Sir Reginald Hildyard, resigned his post, reportedly because the Bermudian Parliament refused to allow him a motor car (motor vehicles having been banned in Bermuda before the First World War, following a petition signed by numerous Bermudians, and by visitors including Woodrow Wilson). On 10 March 1973, the 121st Governor, Richard Sharples, and his aide-de-camp Captain Hugh Sayers, were assassinated in an attack by a Bermudian black activist named Buck Burrows and an accomplice, Larry Tacklin, who were members of the Black Beret Cadres. Under Bermudian law at the time, premeditated murder was a capital offence, and death sentences were often handed out, though routinely commuted. No death sentence had been carried out since the 1940s. After much debate due to the controversial moral issues raised, the sentence stood despite a 6,000-strong petition from Bermudians to the Queen. Both men were hanged in 1977 for the killings and other murders, sparking riots throughout Bermuda. Buck Burrows explained in his confession that he had killed the Governor to prove that he was not untouchable and that white-dominated politics was fallible. He was also found guilty of murdering the police commissioner, George Duckett, six months earlier on 9 September 1972, and of killing the co-owner and book- keeper of a supermarket called the Shopping Centre, Victor Rego and Mark Doe in April 1973.

The brain of Albert Einstein has been a subject of much research and speculation. Albert Einstein's brain was removed within seven and a half hours of his death. His brain has attracted attention because of his reputation as one of the foremost geniuses of the 20th century, and apparent regularities or irregularities in the brain have been used to support various ideas about correlations in neuroanatomy with general or mathematical intelligence. Scientific studies have suggested that, within Einstein's brain, regions involved in speech and language are smaller, while regions involved with numerical and spatial processing are larger. Other studies have suggested an increased number of glial cells in Einstein's brain.Fields, R. Douglas (2009). The Other Brain: From Dementia to Schizophrenia. New York: Simon & Schuster. p.3-8. Diamond MC, Scheibel AB, Murphy GM Jr, Harvey, T,\\"On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert Einstein\\",\\"Experimental Neurology 88, 198-204, 1985\\", February 8, 2017 Fate of the brain Einstein's autopsy was conducted in the lab of Thomas Stoltz Harvey. Einstein didn‚Äôt want his brain or body to be studied. But Harvey took the brain anyway, without permission from Einstein or his family. Shortly after Einstein's death in 1955, Harvey removed and weighed the brain at 1230g. Harvey then took the brain to a lab at the University of Pennsylvania where he dissected it into several pieces; some of the pieces he kept to himself while others were given to leading pathologists. He claimed he hoped that cytoarchitectonics, the study of brain cells under a microscope, would reveal useful information. Harvey injected 50% formalin through the internal carotid arteries and afterward suspended the intact brain in 10% formalin. Harvey photographed the brain from many angles. He then dissected it into about 240 blocks (each about 1 cm3) and encased the segments in a plastic-like material called collodion.The Exceptional Brain of Albert Einstein ‚Äì BIOQUANT LIFE SCIENCE . Lifescience.bioquant.com. Retrieved on 2011-05-16. Harvey also removed Einstein's eyes, and gave them to Henry Abrams, Einstein's ophthalmologist. Whether or not Einstein's brain was preserved with his prior consent is a matter of dispute. Ronald Clark's 1979 biography of Einstein states, \\"he had insisted that his brain should be used for research and that he be cremated\\", but more recent research has suggested that this may not be true and that the brain was removed and preserved without the permission of either Einstein or his close relatives. Hans Albert Einstein, the physicist's elder son, endorsed the removal after the event, but insisted that his father's brain should be used only for research to be published in scientific journals of high standing. In 1978, Einstein's brain was rediscovered in Harvey's possession by journalist Steven Levy.StevenLevy.com ¬ª I Found Einstein's Brain Its sections had been preserved in alcohol in two large mason jars within a cider box for over 20 years. In 2010, Harvey's heirs transferred all of his holdings constituting the remains of Einstein's brain to the National Museum of Health and Medicine, including 14 photographs of the whole brain (which was now in fragments) never before revealed to the public.Falk, Dean, Frederick E. Lepore, and Adrianne Noe (2012), \\"The cerebral cortex of Albert Einstein: a description and preliminary analysis of unpublished photographs\\", Brain; 135: 11.Balter, Michael, \\"Rare photos show that Einstein's brain has unusual features\\", The Washington Post, Tuesday, 27 November 2012; E6. More recently, 46 small portions of Einstein's brain were acquired by the M√ºtter Museum in Philadelphia. In 2013, these thin slices, mounted on microscope slides, went on exhibit in the museum's permanent galleries. Scientific studies The lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure) in a normal brain. In Einstein's brain, this was truncated. =Autopsy= Harvey had reported that Einstein had no parietal operculum in either hemisphere, but this finding has been disputed. Photographs of the brain show an enlarged Sylvian fissure. In 1999, further analysis by a team at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario revealed that his parietal operculum region in the inferior frontal gyrus in the frontal lobe of the brain was vacant. Also absent was part of a bordering region called the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure). Researchers at McMaster University speculated that the vacancy may have enabled neurons in this part of his brain to communicate better. \\"This unusual brain anatomy...[missing part of the Sylvian fissure]... may explain why Einstein thought the way he did,\\" said Professor Sandra Witelson who led the research published in The Lancet. This study was based on photographs of the whole brain made at autopsy in 1955 by Harvey and not a direct examination of the brain. Einstein himself claimed that he thought visually rather than verbally. Professor Laurie Hall of Cambridge University, commenting on the study, said, \\"To say there is a definite link is one bridge too far, at the moment. So far, the case isn't proven. But magnetic resonance and other new technologies are allowing us to start to probe those very questions.\\" =Glial cells= In the 1980s, University of California, Berkeley professor Marian Diamond received four sections of the cortical association regions of the superior prefrontal and inferior parietal lobes in the right and left hemispheres of Albert Einstein's brain from Thomas Harvey. In 1984, Marian Diamond and her associates were the first ever to publish research on the brain of Albert Einstein.Diamond MC, Scheibel AB, Murphy GM Jt, Harvey T,\\"On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert Einstein\\",\\"Experimental Neurology 88, 198-204, 1985\\", February 8, 2017 She compared the ratio of glial cells in Einstein's brain with that of the preserved brains of 11 other males. (Glial cells provide support and nutrition in the brain, form myelin, and participate in signal transmission, and are the other integral component of the brain, besides the neurons.) Dr. Diamond's laboratory made thin sections of Einstein's brain, each 6 micrometers thick. They then used a microscope to count the cells. Einstein's brain had more glial cells relative to neurons in all areas studied, but only in the left inferior parietal area was the difference statistically significant. This area is part of the association cortex, regions of the brain responsible for incorporating and synthesizing information from multiple other brain regions. A stimulating environment can increase the proportion of glial cells and the high ratio could possibly result from Einstein's life studying stimulating scientific problems.The strange afterlife of Einstein's brain Diamond MC, Scheibel AB, Murphy GM Jr, Harvey T,\\"On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert Einstein\\", \\"Experimental Neurology 88, 198-204, 1985\\", Retrieved February 9, 2017 The limitation that Diamond admits in her study is that she had only one Einstein to compare with 11 brains of normal intelligence individuals. S. S. Kantha of the Osaka Bioscience Institute criticized Diamond's study, as did Terence Hines of Pace University. Other issues related to Diamond's study point out glial cells continue dividing as a person ages and although Einstein's brain was 76, it was compared to brains that averaged 64 in age (eleven male brains, 47‚Äì80 years of age). Diamond in her landmark study \\"On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert Einstein\\" noted that the 11 male individuals whose brains were used in her control base had died from nonneurologically related diseases. She also noted that \\"Chronological age is not necessarily a useful indicator in measuring biological systems. Environmental factors also play a strong role in modifying the conditions of the organism. One major problem in dealing with human specimens is that they do not come from controlled environments.\\"Diamond MC, Scheibel AB, Murphy GM Jr, Harvey T,\\"On the Brain of a Scientist: Albert Einstein\\", \\"Experimental Neurology 88, 198-204, 1985\\" Retrieved February 9, 2017 Additionally, there is little information regarding the samples of brains that Einstein's brain was compared against such as IQ score, or other relevant factors. Diamond also admitted that research disproving the study was omitted. =Hippocampus= Dr. Dahlia Zaidel of the University of California, Los Angeles, examined two slices of Albert Einstein's brain containing the hippocampus in 2001. The hippocampus is a subcortical brain structure that plays an important role in learning and memory. The neurons on the left side of the hippocampus were found to be significantly larger than those on the right, and when compared with normal brain slices of the same area in ordinary people, there was only minimal, inconsistent asymmetry in this area. \\"The larger neurons in the left hippocampus, Zaidel noted, imply that Einstein's left brain may have had stronger nerve cell connections between the hippocampus and another part of the brain called the neocortex than his right. The neocortex is where detailed, logical, analytical and innovative thinking takes place, Zaidel noted in a prepared statement.\\" =Stronger connection between brain hemispheres= A study published in the journal Brain in September 2013 analyzed Einstein's corpus callosum - a large bundle of fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication in the brain - using a novel technique that allowed for a higher resolution measurement of the fiber thickness. Einstein's corpus callosum was compared to two sample groups: 15 brains of elderly people and 52 brains from people aged 26. Einstein was 26 in 1905, his Annus Mirabilis (Miracle Year). The findings show that Einstein had more extensive connections between certain parts of his cerebral hemispheres compared to both younger and older control group brains. =Newly recovered photographs= A study, \\"The cerebral cortex of Albert Einstein: a description and preliminary analysis of unpublished photographs\\", was published on November 16, 2012, in the journal Brain. Dean Falk, an evolutionary anthropologist at Florida State University, led the study - which analyzed 14 recently discovered photographs - and described the brain: \\"Although the overall size and asymmetrical shape of Einstein's brain were normal, the prefrontal, somatosensory, primary motor, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices were extraordinary.\\" There was a fourth ridge (apart from the three normal people have) in Einstein's mid-frontal lobe involved in making plans and working memory. The parietal lobes were markedly asymmetrical and a feature in Einstein's primary motor cortex may have been associated with his musical ability. Another study led by Shanghai-based East China Normal University's Department of Physics, \\"The Corpus Callosum of Albert Einstein's Brain: Another Clue to His High Intelligence\\", published in the journal Brain on September 24, 2013, showed a new technique to conduct the study, which is the first to detail Einstein's corpus callosum, the brain's largest bundle of fibers that connects the two cerebral hemispheres and facilitates interhemispheric communication. Einstein's corpus callosum was thicker than those in control groups, possibly indicating better cooperation between the hemispheres. Scientists currently cannot tell how far the unusual features above were innate or how far they were due to Einstein devoting his life to higher thought. =Criticism= Publication bias may have influenced published results, which means that results showing differences between Einstein's brain and other brains tend to get published while results showing that in many respects Einstein's brain was like other brains tend to be neglected. Researchers knew which brain was Einstein's and which were controls, allowing possible conscious or unconscious bias and preventing impartial research. Neurologist Terence Hines of Pace University is strongly critical of the studies and has stated that they are flawed. Hines maintains that all human brains are unique and different from others in some ways. Therefore, assuming unique features in Einstein's brain were connected with his genius, in Hines opinion, goes beyond the evidence. He argues further that correlating unusual brain features with any characteristic requires studying many brains with those features, and says that scanning the brains of many very capable scientists would be better research than investigating the brains of just one or two geniuses. Brains of other geniuses Preserving the brains of geniuses was not a new phenomenon‚Äîanother brain to be preserved and discussed in a similar manner was that of the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss almost a hundred years earlier. His brain was studied by Rudolf Wagner who found its weight to be 1,492 grams and the cerebral area equal to 219,588 square millimeters. the reference says: \\"Gauss, 3000 grm. 957 grm. 219588. sq. mm. \\", i.e the unit is square mm. In the later reference: Dunnington (1927), the unit is erroneously reported as square cm, which gives an unreasonably large area. See Carl Friedrich Gauss discussion page for additional info. Also found were highly developed convolutions, which was suggested as the explanation of his genius.Dunnington, 1927 Other brains that were removed and studied include those of Vladimir Lenin, the mathematician Sofia Kovalevskaya, and the Native American Ishi. The brain of Edward H. Rulloff, a noted philologist and criminal, was removed after his death in 1871; in 1972, it was still the second largest brain on record.New York Times, Nov. 7, 1972, p. 37 See also *Relics: Einstein's Brain, a 1994 documentary by Kevin Hull * Possessing Genius: The Bizarre Odyssey of Einstein's Brain, a 2001 book by Carolyn Abraham References External links *How Albert Einstein's Brain Worked Category:Albert Einstein Category:Individual human heads, skulls and brains Category:History of neuroscience Category:1955 in science ","title":"Albert Einstein's brain"},{"id":"3627196","title":"Goldens Bridge station"},{"id":"3627198","text":"Too Cool to Live, Too Smart to Die is a mini-LP released by the Canadian garage rock band Deja Voodoo.

Stanley also wrote four issues of Caff, a fanzine created with childhood friend Pete Wiggs (with whom he would later create Saint Etienne). In 1987, Stanley sent an issue of Caff to James Brown, then live reviews editor for NME. This led to Stanley's first commissioned work, a review of a Johnny Cash show in Peterborough. After two years he moved to Melody Maker, where he wrote regularly until Saint Etienne became a full-time occupation in 1991. Even as Saint Etienne dominated his career, Stanley continued to write occasionally for The Face and Mojo in the 1990s. In the 2000s he has returned to journalism, writing about art and architecture as well as music. He contributes regularly to various publications including The Times and The Guardian. =Books= In 2007, with Paul Kelly Stanley edited Match Day, a book of football programme artwork. In 2013, Faber and Faber published Stanley's second book,Yeah Yeah Yeah: The Story of Modern Pop, a history of pop music from the publication of the first British pop chart in 1952 until the advent of iTunes in 2001. An abridged edition was published by W W Norton in the USA in 2014. In 2015, Turner translated into Spanish,Yeah Yeah Yeah: La historia del pop moderno, Spain, Stanley is working on his third book, Too Darn Hot: The Story of Popular Music. This is scheduled to be published by Faber and Faber in 2020. This book looks at the history of popular music from the start of recorded music until the advent of rock and roll in the early 1950s. He was the winner of the 2017 Eccles British Library Writers in Residence Award, which supports his research for Too Darn Hot using the Library's American collections. Film While recording the album Finisterre in 2002, Stanley, Pete Wiggs and frequent collaborator Paul Kelly made a film to accompany the record, also titled Finisterre, which was described by The Observer as a \\"cinematic hymn to London\\". It premiered at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London and was screened around the world by one dot zero. In 2005 Saint Etienne and Kelly were invited by the Barbican Centre to create a film and music event, for which they made What Have You Done Today Mervyn Day, a drama-documentary set in the Lower Lea Valley, the site for the 2012 Olympic Games. In 2007 their third London film, This Is Tomorrow, a history of the Southbank Centre, premiered with a live performance, including a 60-piece orchestra, at the Royal Festival Hall. Kelly and Saint Etienne collaborated again on How We Used to Live (2014), which has been described as \\"a cherishable, woozy-hazy trawl of London from postwar days to yuppiedom\\". Stanley has curated several film seasons for arts institutions including the Barbican, including Gonna Make You A Star (a series of pop documentaries) and Britain Learns to Rock (early British Rock'n'Roll movies). In 2016, he was commissioned by 14-18 Now as creative producer on a project to explore the impact of the First World War on the north-east of England. The resulting film and music commission, Asunder, featuring a film directed by artist-filmmaker Esther Johnson, co-produced and scripted by Stanley, and a soundtrack by Field Music and Warm Digits, premiered at the Sunderland Empire in July 2016 and later toured to the Barbican in London. In 2017, as part of Hull 2017: UK City of Culture's Mind on the Run season exploring the influence and legacy of jazz composer Basil Kirchin, Stanley co-directed a short film, Abstractions of Holderness, filmed in the isolated area of the east coast of England where Kirchin settled in the 1970s. Pete Wiggs composed the soundtrack, which was performed at the Mind on the Run concert by the BBC Concert Orchestra and various musicians who had collaborated with Kirchin in the past. Record labels In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Stanley briefly ran a record label called Caff Records, which released 17 7\\" singles, all limited to 500 copies, including early singles by the Manic Street Preachers and Pulp. Between 1992 and 1994, Stanley and Saint Etienne bandmate Pete Wiggs ran the indie label Icerink Records; the most notable act to emerge from this endeavour was the girl-group Shampoo. In 1996, Stanley ran EMIDisc, again alongside Wiggs, backed by EMI Director of A&R; Tris Penna. The label was to be an EMI sub- label devoted to new talent. The label was short-lived, releasing albums by Kenickie and Denim. Stanley and Wiggs also previously ran a CD imprint called Eclipse through Universal. Stanley started his own imprint, Croydon Municipal, via Cherry Red in 2012, specialising in music from the mid-twentieth century. Record collecting Stanley is known for his large collection of vinyl records. When Saint Etienne are between projects, he DJs, playing generally 1960s and 1970s pop music and soul. With Wiggs, he ran a club called Don't Laugh in the mid-1990s in Maida Vale. Cherrybomb, a girl group night in Bloomsbury, ran from 2006‚Äì2009. He regularly works as a consultant for reissue record labels, notably Ace Records. English Weather, which he compiled with bandmate Pete Wiggs, was named The Guardian 's Album of the Week in January. He has written liner notes for many reissues, including box sets by Joe Meek, Sandie Shaw and The Searchers.  Personal life  Stanley lives with his girlfriend and their son, dividing his time between London and West Yorkshire.

Headlights are modernized. ET22-886 seen from the left side (air intakes in last configuration) PKP class ET22 is a Polish six-axle electric freight locomotive built by Pafawag from 1969 to 1989. Factory designation is 201E. With 1183 units, it is most numerous standard gauge electric locomotive built in Europe.Terczy≈Ñski, Pawe≈Ç. ≈öwiat Kolei 8/2006 Further 23 units were built for Morocco as E-1000 class. History Soon after Pafawag started the production of a universal EU07 locomotive, The Rolling-stock Industry Central Bureau of Construction (Pl.: Centralne Biuro Konstrukcyjne Przemys≈Çu Taboru Kolejowego) began to develop a new heavy Co-Co freight locomotive. The electrical part of the locomotive including the traction motors was based on the equipment used in EU07 locomotive. The new locomotive had some modern features, including its body. The E-1006 of 201Eg type used in Morocco. The first two prototypes of the class 201E were ready by the end of 1969 (ET22-001 and 002). A short series of ten was made in 1971, and large scale production started next year. PKP bought 1183 locomotives until the production was ceased in 1989 (numbered ET22-001 to ET22-1183, including two 201Ec type). Last were delivered in 1990. This made the ET22 class the most numerous standard gauge electric locomotive built in Europe. During the production the design of the ET22 locomotive was slightly altered. Some changes were also made during repair and maintenance. The body of the locomotives in use is different from the prototypes in details. There are three basic types of locomotive bodies where the main differences are the size and placement of the side windows, air intakes and ventilation grids. From ET22-013 big grids on the left side for resistors' cooling were moved from upper part to lower part of the body. From ET22-242 air intakes for engines' cooling were moved from a roof edge to side walls, on both sides, which is most popular configuration. *ET22-001 - left side: four big ventilation grids in an upper part of the body, six air intakes and seven air outlets on a roof edge; right side: six air intakes in two groups on the roof edge. *ET22-013 - left side: five ventilation grids in a lower part of the body, six air intakes and seven air outlets on a roof edge; right side as above. *ET22-242 - left side: seven ventilation grids in a lower part and two in an upper part of the body, seven air outlets on a roof edge; right side: two ventilation grids in a lower part and two in an upper part of the body; added windows to all side doors. From ET22-122 there was simplified and improved a suspension of the body, without transversal beams. From ET22-282, big headlights, typical for Polish railways, were fitted in conical covers instead of hexagonal. In 1973 Pafawag built a prototype passenger locomotive of the building type 201Ea, which had a different gear ratio for top speed 160 km/h, with no other substantial changes. The locomotive was classified as EP23-001, being a sole machine of this class. After a series of tests, the locomotive characteristics were found unsatisfactory and no more were built. In 1979 the prototype was rebuilt to ET22 standard and renamed ET22-121 in place of former locomotive 121 scrapped in 1977. Today this locomotive is conserved in Jaworzyna ≈ölƒÖska railway museum. Another two prototype locomotives were produced in 1978 as type 201Ec (also known as type 202E). Main changes introduced were an improved secondary suspension, multiple unit control and several small modernisations, like automatic door control. Wheelbase of bogies increased from 3,500 m to 3,800 m and they were connected with a linkage, but an overall wheelbase increased only by 0,08 m. Those locomotives were first given the numbers 501 and 502. As the production of ET22 continued, those were renumbered to 701 and 702 and finally to 1001 and 1002, which they carried until the end. A modernization was considered successful, but in a view of an economical crisis in 1980s in Poland, the authorities of a planned economy lost an interest in starting a production of an improved locomotive. In the 1980s PKP needed locomotives for passenger service. Since the freight service declined, the ET22 could be used for passenger service. They were fitted with main reservoir pipes required for the automatic door control of the passenger coaches. In 2004 the locomotive ET22-315 was modernised in ZNLE Gliwice and renamed ET22-2000 (201Em type). Main modifications affected the electrical and mechanical main components as well as the driver's cab which was equipped with a modern computerised control system and joysticks. The locomotive is painted in PKP Cargo colours. Moroccan E-1000 class The only locomotives of 201E family built for export were 23 modified units of 201Eg type for Moroccan railways ONCF, delivered in 1976. They differe in equipment and details, most noticeably they have single- part pantographs Faiveley.Terczy≈Ñski, Pawe≈Ç. ≈öwiat Kolei 1/2007 Initially they were meant to haul phosphorite trains from mountain parts of the country to Casablanca, later they found use in passenger trains. In 2003 three were re- sold to Polish private operator CTL Rail (E-1003, 1018, 1021) and modified to Polish standards. Technical data Despite of its ET designation (marking a freight locomotive) ET22 is a universal locomotive, and it is occasionally seen in passenger traffic. Its maximum continuous power is and it is the biggest single-box Co-Co locomotive in PKP service. Technical features enable this engine to pull heavy freight trains of up to 3150 t with a speed of 70 km/h. Trains of up to 2700 t can be hauled at 80 km/h. When used as passenger locomotive it can pull trains weighing up to 700 t at 125 km/h. This is caused by several features and solutions based on passenger EU07 and EU06 locomotives. Four EE-451A engines are isolated in H class with maximum temperature allowed of 180 ¬∞C. They have four main and four commutative poles. Because of its length and the wheelbase between axles ET22 locomotive performs poorly on tight curves, unlike the older ET21 locomotives, despite the fact that the designers were given the same parameters for minimum curve diameter. Using the ET22 at winding tracks can cause severe damage both to rails and locomotive bogies. This forced several modifications, which are made presently. Such changes are essential, as fewer and fewer ET21 locomotives are in service and ET41 are ineffective on highland tracks due to serious loss of power. The locomotives were originally painted in two shades of green, with grey roofs. In the 1980s and 1990s their ends were painted yellow for better visibility, but during further repairs an original, the more aesthetic old scheme was being restored, or only a narrow yellow stripe was retained.

Veeder AVA in the Mayacamas Mountains within the Napa Valley AVA, bordering the Sonoma Valley AVA. The estate is known for producing wine of a more traditional style than the Napa trends of recent years that emphasizes power, weight, high levels of alcohol and extravagance. History The winery was built in 1889 by John Henry Fisher a German immigrant who went bankrupt in the early 1900s. It then fell into disuse for several years although bootleggers are said to have made wine in the old stone cellar during the early years of the Prohibition. During the late 1920s and 1930s the property was owned by the Brandlin family. British chemist Jack Taylor and his wife Mary bought the property in 1941, and the estate received its current name. In 1968 the winery was bought by Robert Travers and his wife Elinor. Under their direction, the aging facilities was enlarged, neighboring land purchased, and vineyard clearing, planting and replanting are an ongoing process. Elinor Travers died in 2007. The property was purchased by investor Charles Banks and his wife, Ali, in partnership with retail entrepreneur Jay Schottenstein and his son, Joey. The sale price was not disclosed. Banks, the former president of CSI Capital Management in San Francisco, served as managing partner at Napa's Jonata and Screaming Eagle wineries before leaving in 2009 to found Terroir Capital, a winery, restaurant and hotel investment group. The Schottenstein family purchased Carmel Winery in Israel earlier this year. The estate was featured as a location in the 1995 film A Walk in the Clouds portraying Napa Valley of the 1940s.CNN.com (November 16, 1995). Timeless vineyard celebrated in the movies =Paris tasting= The winery received international recognition after its Cabernet Sauvignon was selected for competition in the 1976 \\"Judgment of Paris\\" wine competition. Robert Travers had agreed to sell three bottles of the still unreleased 1971 vintage for the event, although he did not consider it ready to drink. In the Wine Spectator Wine Tasting of 1986, blind tasters evaluated how the Cabernet Sauvignon wines had aged ten years after the Paris event. The 1971 Mayacamas Vineyards was ranked ninth. On the 30th anniversary of the Paris event, two panels of expert wine tasters tasted all the original red entries to assess how the wines had aged. Mayacamas Vineyards tied for third place (with Heitz Wine Cellars) in the field of ten. Production Cultivating Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon grapes, and small blocks of Sauvignon blanc, Pinot noir, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, the vineyard area extends . The winery produces approximately a total of 5,000 cases of wine per year. On average there is produced 2,000 cases of Cabernet Sauvignon and 2,000 cases of Chardonnay. There is also produced approximately 600 cases of Sauvignon blanc as well as a few hundred cases of Pinot noir. References * Taber, George M. (2005).

G. Wodehouse. It was published as Their Mutual Child in the United States on 5 August 1919 by Boni & Liveright, New York, and as The Coming of Bill in the United Kingdom on 1 July 1920 by Herbert Jenkins Ltd, London. The story first appeared in Munsey's Magazine (US) in May 1914 under the title The White Hope.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 34‚Äì35. The novel tells the story of Kirk Winfield, his wife Ruth, and their young son, Bill. Bill's upbringing is interfered with by Ruth's busybody aunt, Mrs. Lora Delane Porter, who is an author of books intended to uplift the public mind. Unlike most of Wodehouse's novels, it is not a comic novel. According to publisher Penguin Books, The Coming of Bill \\"is the nearest Wodehouse ever came to a serious novel, although the influence of the musical comedies he was writing at the time is never far away.\\" Plot In New York, Mrs. Lora Delane Porter, domineering writer of books about eugenics and germs, drives too fast and hits George Pennicut, whose leg is injured. George is a man-of-all-work employed by Kirk Winfield, an amiable though unsuccessful artist who lives on modest private means. Kirk carries George into his apartment and calls in a doctor. George will recover completely after a couple of days. Mrs. Porter notices that Kirk is healthy and physically fit, and decides he should marry her niece Ruth Bannister, daughter of wealthy financier John Bannister. Ruth believes in her aunt's views on eugenics, in contrast to her brother Bailey Bannister, John Bannister's son and junior partner, who thinks Mrs. Porter is a bad influence on Ruth. Mrs. Porter introduces Ruth to Kirk, and they fall in love. Percy Shanklyn, an unemployed actor who borrows money from Kirk, does not want him to marry Ruth, so he tells Bailey about Kirk and Ruth. Bailey suspects Mrs. Porter's interference. He objects to Mrs. Porter and Ruth that Kirk is a nobody and an outsider. He also confronts Kirk, but inadvertently reveals to him that Ruth returns his feelings. Kirk's friend Steve Dingle, self-described roughneck and retired boxer who is employed as physical instructor for the Bannisters, advises him to elope with Ruth to avoid trouble with her controlling father. Mr. Bannister rejects Ruth after she marries Kirk. Some months later, Kirk is happily married to Ruth, though she forbids him from employing models. She decides to pose for Kirk once but faints, and it is revealed that she is pregnant. Time passes, and Kirk and Ruth have a son, \\"Bill\\", William Bannister Winfield. Steve, Bill's godfather, wants the baby to become heavyweight boxing champion of the world and encourages this by calling him the \\"White Hope\\". Steve is also in love with his old friend Mamie, Bill's nurse. Mrs. Porter feels that Bill must not be exposed to germs and his nursery should be sterilized, though Ruth dismisses this. When Bill is three years old, Kirk's private income drops when a stock he invested in fails. Bailey's fianc√©e Sybil Wilbur, a friend of Ruth's, wants Kirk to paint her portrait. Kirk has lost his skill due to not working and the portrait turns out badly. Bailey accuses Kirk of being an idle waster. Kirk sees the truth in this and joins his friend Hank Jardine mining gold in Columbia. A year later, Kirk returns to New York, his trip to Columbia a failure. He nearly died of fever in Columbia, and Hank Jardine did die. Kirk is glad to see Ruth again. He is surprised that they are now rich, because John Bannister died and Ruth inherited half his money. Ruth now agrees with Mrs. Porter about germs, since Bill became extremely ill once. Bill lives in a sterilized environment and is not supposed to be hugged, which Kirk finds absurd. Steve visits Mamie in Bill's nursery without permission from Mrs. Porter, but does not manage to confess his feelings for her and she helps him escape when Mrs. Porter comes with a doctor to show her the sanitized nursery. Kirk and Ruth drift apart, since Ruth has been changed by her father's money and has devoted herself to high society life. Kirk notices that Ruth is not really concerned about germs and thinks that she is keeping her distance from Bill because she is bored of him. Kirk hires an old acquaintance, artist Robert Dwight Penway, to teach him painting, and starts selling illustrations. Bailey still dislikes Kirk but he hates Basil Milbank, a man who once came close to marrying Ruth, and warns Kirk that Ruth has been associating with Basil. Kirk suggests to Ruth they go with Bill to Kirk's shack in Connecticut, but Ruth refuses. Kirk, upset with Ruth for being distant and allowing Mrs. Porter to interfere, leaves. Steve, hoping to reunite Kirk and Ruth, decides to kidnap Bill. Bill happily goes with him to Connecticut. Steve leaves a note for Mamie. She tells Kirk, and they follow Steve. Meanwhile, Ruth, who has realized Kirk was right, goes to see Bailey. He is very ill due to stress from work. Bailey recovers, but his financial risks have failed and he and Ruth have lost their money. Ruth is glad the money is gone, and has new respect for Bailey, since she sees how much his wife Sybil cares about him. Ruth assures Sybil that Bailey will be successful again. Mrs. Porter, thinking Kirk has run off with Mamie, finds Ruth and brings her to Connecticut. In Connecticut, Mrs. Porter is defeated when Steve says Mamie is his fianc√©e and Ruth reconciles with Kirk. Kirk looks forward to living a happy, simple life with her and Bill. Style Much of Wodehouse's work combines elements of romance and humour or farce, including even the relatively serious stories The Coming of Bill and The Little Nugget. One example in The Coming of Bill of a \\"typically Wodehousian\\" farcical remark is a quote which makes light of Mrs. Porter's views on heredity, after she drives too fast and hits George Pennicut with her car (in chapter I.1): \\"She was incensed with this idiot who had flung himself before her car, not reflecting in her heat that he probably had a pre-natal tendency to this sort of thing inherited from some ancestor who had played \\"last across\\" in front of hansom cabs in the streets of London.\\"Hall (1974), pp. 11‚Äì12. Background In The Coming of Bill, a butler named Keggs is employed by the Bannisters and later by the Winfields. A butler named Keggs appears in several other Wodehouse stories, though it is unclear which of these characters are the same. Other stories with such a character include the 1909 novella The Gem Collector and the 1910 short story ‚ÄúThe Good Angel‚Äù (collected in The Man Upstairs). There is a landlord and retired butler named Augustus Keggs in Something Fishy (1957) and Ice in the Bedroom (1961), who was a butler in the 1919 novel A Damsel in Distress.Hall (1974), p. 16. Wodehouse married his wife Ethel in 1914 and gained a step-daughter, Leonora; when Wodehouse first met Leonora in 1915, they immediately became close, and he formally adopted her later that year. According to writer Sophie Ratcliffe, this meant that \\"Wodehouse's 1914 satire on the fashion of eugenic family planning (The White Hope) was oddly prescient. Family, for Wodehouse, was forged through love, not genetics. Leonora ‚Äì or \\"Snorky\\" ‚Äì as she soon became, was far more precious to Wodehouse than any of his biological relations.\\". Stated by editor Sophie Ratcliffe, p. 93. Publication history Wodehouse stated in a letter in 1964 that he got the plot of the story from Munsey's Magazine editor Bob Davis. As Wodehouse wrote in the letter concerning the story: \\"It was written in 1910 in the days when Bob Davis edited the Munsey pulps and we young authors used to go to him for plots. He would take a turn around the room and come up with a complete plot for a serial, usually horrible but of course saleable to Munsey's! He gave me the plot of this one and I wrote it, but I have never thought highly of it\\". The story was first published in May 1914 in one issue of Munsey's Magazine under the title The White Hope, with illustrations by E. M. Ashe. It was one of two Wodehouse stories published in Munsey's Magazine, the other being The Little Nugget, which was published in the magazine in 1913.McIlvaine (1990), D.41.1‚Äì2, p. 153.

The Aztecs had a well-developed school of philosophy, perhaps the most developed in the Americas and in many ways comparable to Ancient Greek philosophy, even amassing more texts than the ancient Greeks.Mann, Charles C. 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005. p, 121. Aztec cosmology was in some sense dualistic, but exhibited a less common form of it known as dialectical monism. Aztec philosophy also included ethics and aesthetics. It has been asserted that the central question in Aztec philosophy was how people can find stability and balance in an ephemeral world.  Beliefs  Aztec philosophy saw the concept of Ometeotl as a unity that underlies the universe. Ometeotl forms, shapes, and is all things. Even things in opposition‚Äîlight and dark, life and death‚Äîwere seen as expressions of the same unity, Ometeotl. The belief in a unity with dualistic expressions compares with similar dialectical monist ideas in both Western and Eastern philosophies.  Relation to Aztec religion  Aztec priests had a panentheistic view of religion but the popular Aztec religion maintained polytheism. Priests saw the different gods as aspects of the singular and transcendent unity of Teotl but the masses were allowed to practice polytheism without understanding the true, unified nature of their Aztec gods.  Moral beliefs and aesthetics  Aztec philosophers focused on morality as establishing balance. The world was seen as constantly shifting with the ever-changing teotl. Morality focused on finding the path to living a balanced life, which would provide stability in the shifting world. Aztec philosophy saw the arts as a way to express the true nature of teotl. Art was considered to be good if it in some way brought about a better understanding of teotl. Aztec poetry was closely tied to philosophy and often used to express philosophic concepts.Mann, 122-123 Below is an example of such a poem, translated from the original Nahuatl: No one comes on this earth to stay Our bodies are like rose trees - They grow petals then wither and die. But our hearts are like grass in the springtime, They live on and forever grow green again. How did the Aztecs regard \\"Time\\"? James Maffie has explained that the Aztec concept of Time (like that of the Mayas) was not one of 'uniform forward flow' whose passage could be accurately measured by a clock or some similar device. Specific events were regarded as separate, unique entities, only minimally related to those which had occurred immediately before them or to those which followed straight afterwards. Of paramount importance were the positions which they happened to occupy in the 260-day and 360+5-day calendar counts. Also significant were the 584-day Venusian cycle, and indeed the \\"age- growth cycles\\" of the people involved (which extended from birth through to old age). Texts There is a dearth of material from which Aztec philosophy can be studied with a majority of extant texts written after conquest by either Spanish colonists and missionaries, or Christianised Spanish educated natives. Pre-conquest sources include the Codex Borgia and the Codex Borbonicus (written about the time of conquest). Post-conquest texts include the Florentine Codex, Codex Mendoza and the Codex Magliabechiano, including others.

The persons responsible were frequently selectmen who had additional government responsibilities.Sharp & Walter, p. 2-3. Boston established America's first permanent school committee in 1721; this became America's first school board. (Massachusetts and some other regions retain the term school committee, but school board and board of education are the more common terms nationwide, and a variety of other labels have been used). In 1986, about 95 percent of school board members were elected, with the rest appointed by town boards, mayors, or others.Sharp & Walter, p. 3. In early America, school board members handled the day-to-day administration of schools without the need for a superintendent. By the 1830s, however, the increasing numbers of students, as well as the consolidation of one-room schoolhouses into larger districts, led districts to begin appointing the first superintendents. Buffalo, New York became the first location to appoint a superintendent, with Louisville, Kentucky, following on July 31 of the same year. Large cities, which had the greatest administrative needs, were the first to appoint superintendents, but as schools consolidated into districts, the practice of appointing a superintendent became more popular. A major event in the history of education in the United States was the \\"Kalamazoo school case\\" (Stuart v. School District No. 1 of the Village of Kalamazoo). In 1858, Kalamazoo, Michigan established its first high school, and the following year, the Michigan Legislature enacted legislature authorizing the election of school districts and the establishment of high schools funded by local taxes.The Kalamazoo School Case: Supporting High School Education, Kalamazoo Public Library. In January 1873, three Kalamazoo property owners filed a lawsuit challenging the law. In a unanimous decision of the Michigan Supreme Court in 1874 written by the prominent Justice Thomas M. Cooley, the law was upheld. This decision led to a dramatic increase in the number of high schools operating both in Michigan and other states, which led to an increase in the number of superintendents. Early superintendents tended to focus on instruction, with \\"overall fiscal affairs, school building construction, and maintenance\\" remaining under school district control, becoming normal responsibilities of superintendents only in the early twentieth century.Sharp & Walter, p. 3-4. By the early twentieth century, superintendents emphasized business affairs.Sharp & Walter, p. 4. Important leaders in American education at the time were George D. Strayer, Ellwood P. Cubberley, and Edward C. Elliott, who all wrote doctoral dissertations on education finance at Columbia University in the first decade of the 20th century. Cubberley served as superintendent in San Diego and later taught at Stanford University, Strayer taught at Teachers College, Columbia University, and Elliott taught at the University of Wisconsin. In 1911, the idea of the superintendent as a separate professional emerged. The emergence of the superintendency was linked to the adoption of a business organizational model in education. Beginning in 1914, Columbia and other universities began to teach courses on educational administration, including school finance, business methods, budgeting, and organization. Cubberley wrote a book in 1916 on this \\"New Profession\\" and emphasized the role of superintendent as chief executive of schools.Sharp & Walter, p. 5. In 1914, the U.S. Commissioner of Education wrote that the U.S. was moving \\"unmistakably in the direction of a profession of educational administration as distinct from teaching.\\"Sharp & Walter, p. 4-5. By 1925, journals and books on educational administration had adopted a view of superintendents as executives, as Cubberley had advocated.

The park's house an amphitheater, a lagoon, rose gardens, picnic areas, an Italian castle, scenic walking trails, and various playgrounds. Krug Park \\"lights up\\" during the holiday season as Holiday Park.  History  The park is often referred to as St. Joseph's oldest park. While other areas were given for public use earlier, it is true that Krug Park was the first public outing area under the jurisdiction of the board of park commissioners which received public expenditure. As such, it was developed before any other parks. On February 26, 1890, Henry Krug, donated to the City for use exclusively as a park, on the conditions \\"that no intoxicating liquors shall ever be kept, sold or disposed of in or upon said premises...nor shall any gambling or gambling devices be permitted.\\" The City was to keep the park in good condition, under police control, and expend annually at least $2,000.00 under the direction of the park commissioners. Early plans of Krug Park are not available, but from narrative sources it appears that the City quickly spent in excess of the required $2,000.00 per year. As St. Joseph's only developed public space, Krug Park became the \\"catch-all\\" for everything that the public seemed to desire. Park Superintendent Rudolph G. Rau seemed particularly fond of flower displays and formally designed beds, and Krug Park boasted many such spectacular displays. It also had at one time a zoo, greenhouses, botanical gardens, gazebos, the Robidoux cabin, a fountain, and a lily pond. Krug Park was officially open to the public on May 6, 1902. The impressive stone gateway was just nearing completion at that time. The conservatory, which had been constructed at least since 1900, was a very popular spot for park visitors during this period. Alligators were kept in the pond in front of conservatory, and several other exotic animals were housed around the park. Old war cannons were moved to the park, and (as a result of a hoax) so was the so-called \\"Robidoux cabin.\\" A reporter in need of a story saw an old cabin being torn down, and claimed that it belonged to the town's founder, Joseph Robidoux. As a result, the cabin was moved to Krug Park and maintained for many years. Crime In July 1913, 19 year old Madeline Rowbotham was murdered at the entrance of Krug Park. Her ex-boyfriend, Thomas Harris, slit her throat with a razor. After cutting her throat, the razor broke as he attempted to slash his own throat, and he was restrained. Harris was convicted of murder and served 29 years of a life sentence. He was paroled in 1942 and died in St. Joseph in 1954.

The story concerns a troubled generation of ancestors to Jonathan \\"Pa\\" Kent (Superman's adoptive father). Set in the mid to late 19th century, the two main characters are brothers Nathaniel and Jebediah. The series was written by John Ostrander. As with many limited series, it was later collected as a trade paperback. Publication history The series was written by John Ostrander with pencils/inks for the first eight issues by Timothy Truman/Michael Bair. In issue #9 Tom Mandrake took over full art duties for the final four issues. Plot The story begins with Clark Kent's adoptive father Jonathan writing to his adopted son (Superman) about the memoirs he has discovered on the family farm. They reveal that the Kent family in the 19th century were noted abolitionists who assisted the personnel of the Underground Railroad, like Harriet Tubman. The family moved to Kansas Territory during its infamous violent conflict over its status concerning slavery to promote the cause of creating a free state by running a newspaper for the region. However, the family patriarch was murdered by border ruffians who wanted to silence him. Furthermore, the sons, Nathaniel and Jeb, argued and had a parting of the ways so deep about slavery that they found themselves on opposing sides of the American Civil War, with Jeb fighting with the notorious Confederate guerrilla unit led by William Quantrill and Nathaniel fighting for the North and marrying a half-Native American woman who gave him a special traditional spiritual symbol that was apparently a forerunner and inspiration for Superman's chest symbol. After the war, Nathaniel became a sheriff in Smallville, while Jeb became the leader of a group of bandits. Eventually, Jeb discovered he had a son out of wedlock years ago, and allowed him to join his gang. But his son turned out to be a murderous sociopath and Jeb approached his estranged brother to arrange a trap to stop his son. In springing the trap, the son mortally wounded his father before being killed himself and Jeb has just enough time to fully reconcile with Nate before dying. Nate remained in Smallville and there the Kents have since stayed for generations, including Jonathan and Martha Kent, Superman's adoptive parents. In other works John Ostrander includes a subtle reference to The Kents in the 2002 Marvel/MAX limited series Apache Skies. Set in 1886, the first issue of Apache Skies depicts Johnny Bart‚Äîthe Rawhide Kid‚Äîarriving by train in the town of Sagoro, Texas, seeking to avenge the death of the Apache Kid.

The changes since 1989 cover virtually every aspect of IP law in Romania, including copyright and industrial property, including such relatively new considerations as integrated circuit topographies. The State Office for Inventions and Trademarks protects industrial property, and the Romanian Copyright Office protects copyright and related rights.  History  The first patent granted to a Romanian was in France in 1827 and the first Romanian patent was granted by a royal decree in 1864, during the period when Alexandru Ioan Cuza was prince of both Moldavia and Wallachia, uniting the two by a dynastic union. In 1879, the first trademark law was promulgated, making Romania the seventh country to enact such a law. In 1906, the first patent law was promulgated and the Romanian Office for Industrial Property (now the Romanian State Office for Inventions and Trademarks, OSIM) was founded. After the Romanian Revolution of 1989, Romania changed its legislation completely in the field of industrial property, which is now based on the mechanisms of the market economy and, generally speaking, harmonized with main international treaties and conventions. =International treaties, conventions and agreements signed by Romania= Romania is party to the following important treaties, conventions and agreements: * Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property‚Äî1920; * Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks‚Äî1927; * WIPO Convention‚Äî1970; * European Patent Convention (EPC)‚Äî1973; * Patent Cooperation Treaty‚Äî1978; * Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs‚Äî1992; * Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement‚Äî1998; * Strasbourg, Nice, Vienna and Locarno Agreements on Classifications‚Äî1998; * Trademark Law Treaty‚Äî1998; * Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure ‚Äî2000; * UPOV Convention‚Äî2001; * Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement‚Äî2001.

The V√∂gte (lords protectors) of the monastery were the Counts of Eberstein, but the equivalent rights over Hirsau lay with the Counts of W√ºrttemberg, who considered that as Reichenbach was a priory of Hirsau, their rights should extend there also. The conflict between the two factions continued until the Reformation, when the monastery was turned into a Protestant establishment in 1603. It had been re-catholicised during the Thirty Years' War and occupied by monks from Wiblingen Abbey, who however had to leave again after the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Since then the village of Klosterreichenbach which had developed around the monastery remained Protestant. The buildings of the former monastery have been partially restored in the 19th and 20th century. The church is now the parochial Lutheran church of the village.  References  * Molitor, Stephan, 1997.

From 1996 until 2014, he was the Louis D. Rubin, Jr. Distinguished Professor of physics and astronomy, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He is currently affiliated with the Department of Mathematics and Physics of the University of Salento, in Italy. Early life Born in Kidderminster, England, Frampton attended King Charles I School, 1954‚Äì62 and then Brasenose College, Oxford, 1962‚Äì68. He received BA (Double First) in 1965, MA, DPhil in 1968, and DSc in 1984, degrees from Oxford. Career He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (1990) and the American Physical Society (1981). In 1987 he was the project director for siting the Superconducting Supercollider, in North Carolina. A Festschrift for his 60th birthday has been published. His DPhil thesis analyzed the relationship between current algebra and superconvergence sum rules, and contained a 1967 sum rule. In 1970, he analyzed the absence of ghosts in the dual resonance model. Three examples of his model building are the chiral color model, in 1987, which predicts axigluons; the 331 model, in 1992, which can explain the number of quark-lepton generations, and predicts bileptons; his proposal, in 1995, of the binary tetrahedral group as a flavor symmetry. All three serve as targets of opportunity for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In 2002, he built a model relating matter‚Äìantimatter asymmetry in the early universe to measurements possible on Earth. In 2015, he showed that the 331-model predicts long-lived quarks accessible to Run 2 of the LHC. In formal directions, three examples are that he calculated, in 1976, the rate of vacuum decay in quantum field theory; in 1982, he analyzed ten-dimensional gauge field theory, and its hexagon anomaly, precursor to the first superstring revolution; in 1988, he constructed the Lagrangian which describes the dynamics of the p-adic string. For cosmology, two examples are, in 2007, he built a cyclic model which can solve a 75-year-old entropy problem; in 2010, he discussed how dark energy may be better understood by studying temperature and entropy. In 2015, he demonstrated how cyclic entropy can lead to flat geometry without an inflationary era and estimated the time until contraction to be close to one hundred times the present age of the universe. In 2015 he also proposed a novel theory of dark matter, where the dark matter constituents are primordial black holes with many solar masses.. In 2020, he published a paper about cosmological expansion which suggested, but did not prove, that string theory is not the correct theory of quantum gravity. Drug smuggling conviction In November 2012, Frampton was convicted of drug smuggling in Argentina and was sentenced to four years and eight months in detention. He denied the charges and said that he was a victim of a scam wherein an impostor of an internationally known model on a dating website tricked him into transporting two kilos of cocaine hidden in the liner fabric of a suitcase. The prosecutor presented what he said were text messages, handwritten notes and emails sent by Frampton discussing the suitcase, the drugs, and their street value. Frampton's statements that the prosecutor's evidence was laughable, were translated in court as suggesting that the messages themselves had been intended as jokes. A forensic psychologist diagnosed Frampton with schizoid personality disorder, which Frampton's attorneys argued rendered him to deliver poor judgment in practical matters and increased his gullibility. Soon after his arrest, his pay was stopped and he was placed on personal leave. The move was widely criticized by the academic community. He was fired from his UNC post in 2014. On 16 June 2015 an appeals court in North Carolina unanimously ruled that his university violated its own policies by placing Frampton on unpaid leave while he awaited trial, and ordered the university to restore Frampton's back salary and benefits. Frampton's account of these events was published in 2014. Publications Frampton's first publication was Chirality Commutator and Vector Mesons, in 1967. He has published numerous articles on particle phenomenology. He was the author of a book on string theory, in 1974 (2nd edition, 1986), when it was still named the dual resonance model. In 1986, he published a book on quantum field theory (2nd edition 2000, 3rd edition 2008). A book on cyclic cosmology, for the general public, was published in 2009. He has published 480 scientific articles. *P.H. Frampton and Y.

As of the 2010 census, its population was 441. History On January 15, 1786, the Virginia General Assembly passed an act establishing the town of Smithfield on land owned by John Smith II and William Smith. A post office was established in 1806; and since there was another town called Smithfield in the state, a different name was needed to avoid confusion. Because Smithfield had become a center of commerce between several other towns, the post office became known as \\"Middleway.\\" Middleway remains a small village and retains many of its historic buildings. The Middleway Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. The area where the town grew was first visited by John Smith I and his sons John Smith II and Rees Smith in 1729. By 1734 they had established a grist mill and a hemp mill. In the 1790s, in an effort to increase the town, the Smithfield Promotion was undertaken. This did increase the size of the town, but it stagnated from then on. The town has also been known as \\"Wizard Clip\\" or \\"Clip\\", and townspeople as \\"Clippers\\". This is the result of a legend from the 1790s, in which a traveler lodged with Adam Livingston and his family. During the night, the traveler died, calling for a priest, though Livingston refused to let a Catholic priest enter his home. After the stranger's burial, Livingston saw various disturbing supernatural phenomena: heads and legs falling off chickens, all the crockery spontaneously falling to the floor, etc. The most common experience was a constant clipping sound, like that of scissors, pervaded the house, giving the legend its name. Anyone entering the house had their clothes cut into tatters or half-moon crescents. Livingston dreamed of a priest, and found in Shepherdstown Father Dennis Cahill, a Catholic priest who appeared in his dream. This priest exorcised the spirit and the family converted to Catholicism. Afterwards they would frequently hear a disembodied voice who provided advice, tell them to pray, and told them to be better Catholics.

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United States on 4 October 1919 by George H. Doran, New York, and in the United Kingdom by Herbert Jenkins, London, on 15 October 1919.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 35-36, A24. It had previously been serialised in The Saturday Evening Post, between May and June of that year. Its plot revolves around golf-loving American composer George Bevan who falls in love with a mysterious young lady who takes refuge in his taxicab one day. When he later tracks her down to a romantic rural manor, mistaken identity leads to all manner of brouhaha. Plot Lady Maud Marsh, daughter of the widowed 7th Earl of Marshmoreton, is in love with Geoffrey Raymond, whom she met the previous summer in Wales. Maud has not revealed the man's name to her aristocratic family but has admitted that he is a penniless American. Her family, led by Lord Marshmoreton's haughty sister, Lady Caroline Byng, disapprove of the match and will not allow Maud to leave their home of Belpher Castle in Hampshire, in order to keep her from seeing the man. Lady Caroline wants her step-son, Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Byng, to marry Maud, though unbeknownst to her, Reggie is actually in love with Lord Marshmoreton's secretary, Alice Faraday. Lord Marshmoreton meekly listens to his sister, and to Alice, who is insistent that he write the history of his family, though he only wants to tend to his rose garden. In London's Piccadilly, George Bevan, a bored and lonely American composer of successful musical comedies, sees a pretty girl in brown and laments that he has no justification to approach her, thinking that if only they were in the Middle Ages, he could approach her as a hero offering assistance to a damsel in distress. Depressed, George hails a taxicab, and is surprised when the girl in brown jumps into the cab and asks George to hide her. George wastes no time helping her hide from a stout, disagreeable, well- dressed young man. The man becomes angry and distracted when George knocks his silk hat off, allowing George and the girl to escape, but she soon disappears. George has fallen in love with her, though he does not know her name. Thanks to a newspaper report about the disagreeable young man (who spent the night in jail after punching a policeman), George discovers that the girl in brown was Lady Maud Marsh of Belpher Castle. He is not aware that she had sneaked off to London hoping to see Geoffrey. The disagreeable man was Maud's brother Percy Marsh, Lord Belpher. At the castle, Percy mistakenly believes that George is the unsuitable man Maud is in love with, due to seeing her flee with him in a taxi, though Maud denies this. George, hoping to meet Maud again, rents a cottage near Belpher Castle. Meanwhile, George's friend and colleague Billie Dore, a chorus girl, visits the castle and bonds with Lord Marshmoreton over their shared love of roses. George is able to see Maud again and offer further assistance to her, though Percy and Lady Caroline make it difficult for them to meet. Everyone at the castle comes to believe that George is the man Maud met in Wales, and George is delighted to hear from Reggie Byng and Lord Marshmoreton that Maud loves him. When George confesses his feelings to Maud, she explains that she loves a different man, Geoffrey Raymond. George is dejected, but remains a helpful friend to her. Reggie Byng elopes with Alice Faraday, and Lord Marshmoreton is relieved that Alice will no longer be his secretary. Billie tells the earl that George is rich due to his success as a composer and has good character. Throughout these events, the servants of the castle are holding a sweepstake in which whoever drew the ticket with the name of the man Maud marries will win the money. At first, the cunning page-boy Albert is in a position to win if Maud marries \\"Mr. X\\" (an outsider, ostensibly the unknown American) and helps George, but after the butler Keggs (who drew Reggie Byng) blackmails Albert into trading tickets, Keggs becomes George's ally instead. Keggs convinces Lord Belpher to invite George to a dinner party at the castle, where George proves to be popular. Lady Caroline and Percy continue to disapprove of George, but Lord Marshmoreton, who still believes George is the man Maud has wanted to marry all along, defies his sister and publicly announces that Maud and George are engaged. The earl also marries Billie. George suggests that Maud elope with Geoffrey to avoid awkward explanations. She meets with Geoffrey in London, only to discover that Geoffrey is nothing like she remembers. Though he has inherited a great deal of money, he is now overweight, talks only of food, and is being sued for a breach of promise case after a recent flirtation with another girl. Maud leaves Geoffrey and realizes she is in love with George. She tells George and they happily agree to get married. Publication history The story was serialised between 10 May 1919 and 28 June 1919 in The Saturday Evening Post, with illustrations by Henry Raleigh.McIlvaine (1990), p. 156, D59.34‚Äì41. The US edition of the novel has the dedication, \\"To Maud and Ivan Caryll\\". Ivan Caryll was a composer who had previously collaborated with Wodehouse on the 1918 Broadway musical The Girl Behind the Gun. An excerpt from the novel was included in the 1939 omnibus Week-End Wodehouse (UK edition).McIlvaine (1990), p. 117, B6b. Adaptations The story was made into a silent film, also titled A Damsel in Distress, in 1919. In 1928, Wodehouse collaborated with Ian Hay in adapting the book for the stage. Hay, Wodehouse, and A. A. Milne invested in the production, about which Wodehouse said \\"I don't think we shall lose our money, as Ian has done an awfully good job.\\" The play, which opened at the New Theatre, London, on 13 August 1928, had a successful run of 234 performances. It was produced by Nicholas Hannen, and starred Basil Foster, Jane Baxter, and Reginald Gardiner.McIlvaine (1990), p. 305, J38. Wodehouse was involved in adapting the novel as a musical in 1937. A Damsel in Distress is a 1937 English-themed Hollywood musical comedy film starring Fred Astaire, Joan Fontaine, George Burns, and Gracie Allen. With a screenplay by P. G. Wodehouse, loosely based on his novel of the same name, music and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin, it was directed by George Stevens. A Damsel in Distress was adapted into a stage musical of the same name, which ran from 30 May to 27 June 2015 at Chichester Festival Theatre. The 2019 Indian Bollywood film Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga was inspired by the book.

Biography H√§berle is the son of Hugo H√§berle, a medical doctor, and Ursula H√§berle (born Riebensahm). H√§berle studied law in T√ºbingen, Bonn, Freiburg im Breisgau and Montpellier. In 1961 he received his juris doctor under supervision of Konrad Hesse at the faculty of law, Albert-Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg. His thesis, titled \\"Die Wesensgehaltgarantie des Art. 19 Abs. 2 Grundgesetz\\", became both influential and controversial. In 1970 H√§berle attained his habilitation in Freiburg im Breisgau with a work on \\"√ñffentliches Interesse als juristisches Problem\\" (i.e., public interest as a legal problem). After deputizing as professor in T√ºbingen he became a professor of law in Marburg himself. Later he moved to the Universities of Augsburg and Bayreuth. He served also as visiting professor at the University of St. Gallen (1982‚Äì1999). H√§berle's works have been translated into 18 languages. He was honored by an international Festschrift for his 70th birthday. Much like his academic teacher Konrad Hesse, H√§berle stands in the tradition of the Rudolf Smend school of thought. He has publicly acknowledged this fact in a lot of his works. In 1994 Peter H√§berle received the honorary doctorate of the faculty of law of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in 2000, 2003 and 2007 from the respective faculties in Granada, the Catholic University of Lima and the University of Lisbon. In 2005 the University of Bras√≠lia awarded him with an honorary doctorate. Further honors have included the \\"Great officer of the Republic of Italia\\"-order, the medals of honor of the Constitutional courts in Rome and Lima, the German and the Bavarian cross of merit. Guttenberg plagiarism scandal Peter H√§berle supervised the 2006 doctoral thesis of German politician Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg. Guttenberg's dissertation was later shown to contain copies of texts from the Neue Z√ºrcher Zeitung, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a speech by his predecessor as defense minister, and many other sources, including his main supervisor, H√§berle himself. The dissertation had been awarded a rare \\"summa cum laude\\" (\\"with highest honor\\"), as recommended by H√§berle. However, the PhD degree was revoked in February 2011 for extensive violations of regulations concerning the citation of sources. Initially H√§berle had defended the thesis of Guttenberg, whom he considered \\"one of his best students\\", against accusations of plagiarism, calling them \\"absurd\\". However, he later said that his first spontaneous reaction had been \\"too rash\\" and that he hadn't been aware of the extent of the flaws in Guttenberg's dissertation. H√§berle said that these flaws were \\"severe\\" and \\"not acceptable\\". He did not address his own failure to identify the flaws of the dissertation.

It is located two miles north of the city of Chester, with approximate boundaries formed by the A41 Liverpool-Chester trunk road and Shropshire Union Canal to the east and southeast, the A540 Wirral Peninsula trunk road (Parkgate Road) to the south and west and the A5117 Dunkirk link road to the north. According to the 2001 census, the village had a population of 663, reducing to 626 at the 2011 Census. The total 2001 ward population, which included the nearby settlements of Backford, Capenhurst, Ledsham and Wervin, was 2,077. This ward had been combined with Saughall by the time of the 2011 Census.(qv) History The village previously consisted of two separate settlements. Great Mollington was formerly known as Mollington Tarrant and was a township in the parish of Backford. It had a population of 111 in 1801, and 122 in 1851. Little Mollington (Mollington Banastre) was a township in the parish of St. Mary on the Hill, Wirral Hundred. Its population was previously 23 in 1801, 16 in 1851 and 44 in 1901. Both settlements had been combined into Mollington civil parish in 1901 with a total population of 232, increasing to 335 in 1951 and 663 in 2001. Mollington railway station, linking the village directly with Chester and with Liverpool via the Wirral, was closed on 7 March 1960; the station building is now a private residence. In 1982, Mollington became the first place in Britain to have a Neighbourhood Watch scheme, following the success of similar programmes in North America. Description Mollington is a small semi-rural commuter village of approximately 300 homes, served by St. Oswald's Primary School (formerly Mollington Church of England Primary School) and a village hall. All other facilities are now located in other nearby suburbs of Chester following the closure of the village shop and post office. Mollington's parish church is located in the neighbouring village of Backford. The village is served by two local bus routes, but with an infrequent service most residents move about by private transport. Mollington is characterised by tree-lined lanes with grass verges and farm land as well as sizeable family homes. It has an open, rolling and green aspect, which made it a pleasant location for the former Mollington Hall, a country house residence, now demolished. The old red-brick boundary wall of this substantial estate still remains and is now a feature of the village obvious to those who pass through. Neighbouring large houses on the edge of the village are now luxury hotels, including the Mollington Banastre and Crabwall Manor (formerly Crabwall Hall). Sport Mollington is home to Mollington Cricket Club (MCC), a village team that plays friendly matches in the north west and Wales. Beginning with a one-off match on the school field in the 1980s, the team settled at the Dale Army Camp in Upton, Chester, before relocating to Whitby in Ellesmere Port. With an annual fixture list of 15 matches, the team has a squad of 20 players picked from the talent pool of Mollington, Backford and Saughall. The MCC has played in the Village Cricket Competition and the Cheshire Plate in the past.

Infected birds pass on H5N1 through their saliva, nasal secretions, and feces. Other birds may pick up the virus through direct contact with these excretions or when they have contact with surfaces contaminated with this material. Because migratory birds are among the carriers of the H5N1 virus it may spread to all parts of the world. Past outbreaks of avian flu have often originated in crowded conditions in southeast and east Asia, where humans, pigs, and poultry live in close quarters. In these conditions a virus is more likely to mutate into a form that more easily infects humans. A few isolated cases of suspected human to human transmission exist, with the latest such case in June 2006 (among members of a family in Sumatra). No pandemic strain of H5N1 has yet been found. H5N1 vaccines for chickens exist and are sometimes used, although there are many difficulties, and it's difficult to decide whether it helps more or hurts more. H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccines exist in quantities sufficient to inoculate a few million people and might be useful for priming to \\"boost the immune response to a different H5N1 vaccine tailor-made years later to thwart an emerging pandemic\\". H5N1 pandemic vaccines and technologies to rapidly create them are in the H5N1 clinical trials stage but can not be verified as useful until after there exists a pandemic strain. Environmental survival Avian flu virus can last indefinitely at a temperature dozens of degrees below freezing, as is found in the northernmost areas that migratory birds frequent. Heat kills H5N1 (i.e. inactivates the virus). Influenza A viruses can survive: * Over 30 days at 0 ¬∞C (32.0 ¬∞F) (over one month at freezing temperature) * 6 days at 37 ¬∞C (98.6 ¬∞F) (one week at human body temperature) * decades in permanently frozen lakes * on hard non-porous surface such as plastic or stainless steel for 24‚Äì48 hours * on clothes, paper and tissues for 8-12 hours Restricted access; only summary available without login. While cooking poultry to 70 ¬∞C (158 ¬∞F) kills the H5N1 virus, it is recommended to cook meat to 74 ¬∞C (165 ¬∞F) to kill all foodborne pathogens.CIDRAP article Germany finds H5N1 in frozen duck meat published September 10, 2007 Inactivation of the virus also occurs under the following conditions: * 30 minutes 60 ¬∞C (140.0 ¬∞F) (half-hour at a temperature that causes first and second degree burns in humans in ten seconds) * Acidic pH conditions * Presence of oxidizing agents such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, lipid solvents, and B-propiolactone * Exposure to disinfectants: formalin, iodine compounds Ordinary levels of chlorine in tap water kill H5N1 in public water systems. To kill avian flu viruses,Source of quotation: H5N1 \\"can remain infectious in municipal landfills for almost 2 years. [...] The two factors that most reduced influenza survival times were elevated temperature and acidic or alkaline pH.\\"physorg.com Reprint from: American Chemical Society; article \\"Bird flu virus remains infectious up to 600 days in municipal landfills\\" published May 27th, 2009 Avian flu in birds According to Avian Influenza by Timm C. Harder and Ortrud Werner: :Following an incubation period of usually a few days (but rarely up to 21 days), depending upon the characteristics of the isolate, the dose of inoculum, the species, and age of the bird, the clinical presentation of avian influenza in birds is variable and symptoms are fairly unspecific. Therefore, a diagnosis solely based on the clinical presentation is impossible. The symptoms following infection with low pathogenic AIV may be as discrete as ruffled feathers, transient reductions in egg production or weight loss combined with a slight respiratory disease. Some LP strains such as certain Asian H9N2 lineages, adapted to efficient replication in poultry, may cause more prominent signs and also significant mortality. In its highly pathogenic form, the illness in chickens and turkeys is characterised by a sudden onset of severe symptoms and a mortality that can approach 100% within 48 hours. The current method of prevention in animal populations is to destroy infected animals, as well as animals suspected of being infected. In southeast Asia, millions of domestic birds have been slaughtered to prevent the spread of the virus. =Poultry farming practices= There have been a number of farming practices that have changed in response to outbreaks of the H5N1 virus, including: * vaccinating poultry against bird flu * vaccinating poultry workers against human flu * limiting travel in areas where H5N1 is found * increasing farm hygiene * reducing contact between livestock and wild birds * reducing open-air wet markets * limiting workers contact with cock fighting * reducing purchases of live fowl * improving veterinary vaccine availability and cost. For example, after nearly two years of using mainly culling to control the virus, the Vietnamese government in 2005 adopted a combination of mass poultry vaccination, disinfecting, culling, information campaigns and bans on live poultry in cities. =Dealing with outbreaks= The majority of H5N1 flu cases have been reported in southeast and east Asia. Once an outbreak is detected, local authorities often order a mass slaughter of birds or animals infected or suspected to be infected. =Use of vaccines= Dr. Robert G. Webster et al. write :Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines.\\" Webster speculates that substandard vaccines may be preventing the expression of the disease in the birds but not stopping them from carrying or transmitting the virus through feces, or the virus from mutating. In order to protect their poultry from death from H5N1, China reportedly made a vaccine based on reverse genetics produced with H5N1 antigens, that Dr Wendy Barclay, a virologist at the University of Reading believes have generated up to six variations of H5N1. =Transmission= The spread of avian influenza in the eastern hemisphere. According to the United Nations FAO, wild water fowl likely plays a role in the avian influenza cycle and could be the initial source for AI viruses, which may be passed on through contact with resident water fowl or domestic poultry, particularly domestic ducks. A newly mutated virus could circulate within the domestic and possibly resident bird populations until highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) arises. This new virus is pathogenic to poultry and possibly to the wild birds that it arose from. Wild birds found to have been infected with HPAI were either sick or dead. This could possibly affect the ability of these birds to carry HPAI for long distances. However, the findings in Qinghai Lake-China, suggest that H5N1 viruses could possibly be transmitted between migratory birds. Additionally, the new outbreaks of HPAI in poultry and wild birds in Russia, Kazakhstan, Western China and Mongolia may indicate that migratory birds probably act as carriers for the transport of HPAI over longer distances. Short-distance transmission between farms, villages or contaminated local water bodies is likewise a distinct possibility. The AI virus has adapted to the environment in ways such as using water for survival and to spread, and creating a reservoir (ducks) strictly tied to water. The water in turn influences movement, social behavior and migration patterns of water bird species. It is therefore of great importance to know the ecological strategy of influenza virus as well, in order to fully understand this disease and to control outbreaks when they occur. Most research is needed concerning HPAI viruses in wild birds. For example, small birds like sparrows and starlings can be infected with deadly H5N1 strains and they can carry the virus from chicken house to chicken house causing massive epidemics among the chickens. However, pigeons do not present a risk as they neither catch nor carry the virus. Avian flu in humans =Human to human transmission= The WHO believes that another influenza pandemic is as likely to occur at any time since 1968, when the last century's third of three pandemics took place. The WHO describes a series of six phases, starting with the inter-pandemic period, where there are no new influenza virus subtypes detected in humans, and progressing numerically to the pandemic period, where there is efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus in the general population. At the present moment, we are at phase 3 on the scale, meaning a new influenza virus subtype is causing disease in humans, but is not yet spreading efficiently and sustainably among humans. So far, H5N1 infections in humans are attributed to bird-to-human transmission of the virus in most cases. Until May 2006, the WHO estimate of the number of human to human transmission had been \\"two or three cases\\". On May 24, 2006, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, estimated that there had been \\"at least three.\\" On May 30, Maria Cheng, a WHO spokeswoman, said there were \\"probably about half a dozen,\\" but that no one \\"has got a solid number.\\" A few isolated cases of suspected human to human transmission exist. with the latest such case in June 2006 (among members of a family in Sumatra). No pandemic strain of H5N1 has yet been found. =Prevention= Notwithstanding possible mutation of the virus, the probability of a \\"humanized\\" form of H5N1 emerging through genetic recombination in the body of a human co-infected with H5N1 and another influenza virus type (a process called reassortment) could be reduced by widespread seasonal influenza vaccination in the general population. It is not clear at this point whether vaccine production and immunization could be stepped up sufficiently to meet this demand. If an outbreak of pandemic flu does occur, its spread might be slowed by increasing hygiene in aircraft, and by examining airline cabin air filters for presence of H5N1 virus. The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises travelers to areas of Asia where outbreaks of H5N1 have occurred to avoid poultry farms and animals in live food markets. Travelers should also avoid surfaces that appear to be contaminated by feces from any kind of animal, especially poultry. There are several H5N1 vaccines for several of the avian H5N1 varieties. H5N1 continually mutates rendering them, so far for humans, of little use. While there can be some cross-protection against related flu strains, the best protection would be from a vaccine specifically produced for any future pandemic flu virus strain. Daniel R. Lucey, co-director of the Biohazardous Threats and Emerging Diseases graduate program at Georgetown University has made this point, \\"There is no H5N1 pandemic so there can be no pandemic vaccine.\\" However, \\"pre-pandemic vaccines\\" have been created; are being refined and tested; and do have some promise both in furthering research and preparedness for the next pandemic.Promising research into vaccines includes:  A promising new bird flu vaccine developed by University of Pittsburgh researchers could provide better protection and be made more quickly than other experimental vaccines. Vaccine manufacturing companies are being encouraged to increase capacity so that if a pandemic vaccine is needed, facilities will be available for rapid production of large amounts of a vaccine specific to a new pandemic strain. It is not likely that use of antiviral drugs could prevent the evolution of a pandemic flu virus. Revised on January 10, 2001. =Symptoms= The human incubation period of avian influenza A (H5N1) is 2 to 17 days. Once infected, the virus can spread by cell-to-cell contact, bypassing receptors. So even if a strain is very hard to initially catch, once infected, it spreads rapidly within a body. For highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a human, \\"the time from the onset to presentation (median, 4 days) or to death (median, 9 to 10 days) has remained unchanged from 2003 through 2006.\\" :See also Pneumonia. Avian influenza HA bind alpha 2-3 sialic acid receptors while human influenza HA bind alpha 2-6 sialic acid receptors. Usually other differences also exist. There is as yet no human form of H5N1, so all humans who have caught it so far have caught avian H5N1. Human flu symptoms usually include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, conjunctivitis and, in severe cases, severe breathing problems and pneumonia that may be fatal. The severity of the infection will depend to a large part on the state of the infected person's immune system and if the victim has been exposed to the strain before, and is therefore partially immune. No one knows if these or other symptoms will be the symptoms of a humanized H5N1 flu. Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in a human appears to be far worse, killing over 50% of humans reported infected with the virus, although it is unknown how many cases (with milder symptoms) go unreported. In one case, a boy with H5N1 experienced diarrhea followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms. As of February 2008, the \\"median age of patients with influenza A (H5N1) virus infection is approximately 18 years [...] The overall case fatality proportion is 61% [...] Handling of sick or dead poultry during the week before the onset of illness is the most commonly recognized risk factor [...] The primary pathologic process that causes death is fulminant viral pneumonia.\\" There have been studies of the levels of cytokines in humans infected by the H5N1 flu virus. Of particular concern is elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFŒ±), a protein that is associated with tissue destruction at sites of infection and increased production of other cytokines. Flu virus-induced increases in the level of cytokines is also associated with flu symptoms including fever, chills, vomiting and headache. Tissue damage associated with pathogenic flu virus infection can ultimately result in death. The inflammatory cascade triggered by H5N1 has been called a 'cytokine storm' by some, because of what seems to be a positive feedback process of damage to the body resulting from immune system stimulation. H5N1 type flu virus induces higher levels of cytokines than the more common flu virus types such as H1N1 Other important mechanisms also exist \\"in the acquisition of virulence in avian influenza viruses\\" according to the CDC. The NS1 protein of the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses circulating in poultry and waterfowl in Southeast Asia is currently believed to be responsible for the enhanced proinflammatory cytokine response. H5N1 NS1 is characterized by a single amino acid change at position 92. By changing the amino acid from glutamic acid to aspartic acid, researchers were able to abrogate the effect of the H5N1 NS1. This single amino acid change in the NS1 gene greatly increased the pathogenicity of the H5N1 influenza virus. In short, this one amino acid difference in the NS1 protein produced by the NS RNA molecule of the H5N1 virus is believed to be largely responsible for an increased pathogenicity (on top of the already increased pathogenicity of its hemagglutinin type which allows it to grow in organs other than lungs) that can manifest itself by causing a cytokine storm in a patient's body, often causing pneumonia and death. =Treatment= Neuraminidase inhibitors are a class of drugs that includes zanamivir and oseltamivir, the latter being licensed for prophylaxis treatment in the United Kingdom. Oseltamivir inhibits the influenza virus from spreading inside the user's body. It is marketed by Roche as Tamiflu. This drug has become a focus for some governments and organizations trying to be seen as making preparations for a possible H5N1 pandemic. In August 2005, Roche agreed to donate three million courses of Tamiflu to be deployed by the WHO to contain a pandemic in its region of origin. Although Tamiflu is patented, international law gives governments wide freedom to issue compulsory licenses for life-saving drugs. A second class of drugs, which include amantadine and rimantadine, target the M2 protein, but have become ineffective against most strains of H5N1, due to their use in poultry in China in the 1990s, which created resistant strains. However, recent data suggest that some strains of H5N1 are susceptible to the older drugs, which are inexpensive and widely available. Research indicates that therapy to block one cytokine to lessen a cytokine storm in a patient may not be clinically beneficial.CIDRAP article Study: Inhibiting cytokine response might not reverse H5N1 infections published July 16, 2007 =Mortality rate= From the first laboratory- confirmed case through November 21, 2016, the number confirmed human cases of H5N1 reported to WHO stands at 856, with 452 fatalities, reflecting a 53% fatality rate. The global case fatality ratio looks only to the official tally of cases confirmed by the WHO. It takes no account of other cases, such as those appearing in press reports. Nor does it reflect any estimate of the global extent of mild, asymptomatic,http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/URItheFlu/tb/5964 Options For Influenza Control VI (Conference, Toronto Canada, June 18, 2007) Even those who were in close contact with both infected birds and infected people showed no sign of ever having been infected, Dr. Dejpichai and colleagues found. The study is consistent with findings in Hong Kong, China, and Cambodia, which showed viral seroprevalence of no more than 10% among poultry workers and people living in villages where H5N1 outbreaks occurred, she said. But it contradicts a population-based study in Vietnam, published last year, that concluded that mild cases of the virus were likely to be common. (see Mild Avian Flu Transmission May Be Common) http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/URItheFlu/tb/2450 or other cases which are undiagnosed, unreported by national governments to the WHO, or for any reason cannot be confirmed by the WHO. While the WHO's case count is clearly the most authoritative, these unavoidable limitations result in an unknown number of cases being omitted from it.

Among his many major accomplishments, he is the Romanian historian credited with authoring the first major synthesis of the history of the Romanian people. Life Born in Ia≈üi,in his writing Istoria ideilor mele (\\"The History of My Ideas\\") (reprinted in I. E. Torou≈£iu, Studii ≈üi documente literare. Vol. IV. Junimea, Bucure»ôti: Inst. Arte grafice Bucovina, 1933) he claims that his father had Anglo-Saxon ancestors. Available at Wikisource (in Romanian) where he graduated from high school, he went on to Vienna in 1870 to study law and then to Berlin, where he studied philosophy. In 1868, he made his debut in Convorbiri Literare with a series of studies on Romanian traditions and on Romanian institutions. At first, Xenopol served as a prosecutor in Ia≈üi, but he later decided to dedicate himself to the study of history. Starting in 1883, he was a professor of universal history at the University of Ia≈üi, where he served as rector from 1898 to 1901. He was elected member of the Romanian Academy in 1893. In his 1899 French-language Les Principes fondamentaux de l'histoire (\\"The Fundamental Principles of History\\"), his work most well known internationally, he argued for history being a true science which follows clearly defined laws and logic, through which the reasons for historical processes could be clearly defined. His six- volume Istoria rom√¢nilor din Dacia-TraianƒÉ (\\"The History of the Romanians in Trajan's Dacia\\"), completed between 1888 and 1893, strongly asserts that the Romanians are of predominantly Roman origin ‚Äì a position further elaborated by the historian Nicolae Iorga, one of Xenopol's numerous pupils (see Origin of the Romanians). Concerning events nearly two millennia in the past and being supported by multiple archaeological findings, it was still contested by some historians. It had, however, very concrete political implications ‚Äì the Roman origin implying that Romanians are inherently different from their Slavic and Magyar neighbors. This, despite his disagreement with radical nationalists and objection to violence against Jews, unfortunately also translated to Xenopol being a noted anti-Semite and collaborator of A. C. Cuza.

She is the wife of Bill Gaither and together they have written more than 700 songs. She performed, traveled and recorded with the Bill Gaither Trio from 1965 through 1991. Since 1991, she has served as a performer, recording artist, songwriter, scriptwriter and narrator for the Gaither Homecoming series of television broadcasts, video and DVD releases, and audio recordings. Early years She was born Gloria Lee Sickal in 1942 in Michigan, a daughter of Pastor Lee Sickal and Dorothy Sickal. She spent some of her childhood and high school years in the Battle Creek area of Michigan, working a brief time for the Kellogg Company. Education When Sickal graduated from Clare High School in Clare, Michigan, she attended Anderson University in Anderson, Indiana. There, she triple majored in English, French, and Sociology. Her extracurricular activities at the college included participation in the Drama Club, Alpha Chi National College Honor Society and Sigma Tau Delta honor society. Upon her graduation, she took a job at Alexandria Monroe High School as a French teacher. There, she met Bill Gaither, who was teaching English at the time. She married Gaither in 1962, and they began writing songs recreationally. In 1991, she attended Ball State University and received a Master of Arts in British and American Literature. She taught as an adjunct professor at Anderson University in 1987‚Äì88 and 1996‚Äì97. Career Bill and Gloria Gaither began writing songs in the 1960s, and many those songs (including \\"Because He Lives\\", \\"I Am Loved\\", \\"Something Beautiful\\") would go on to become church hymn book standards across North America and around the world. By the end of the 1960s, Gloria, Bill, and Bill's brother Danny Gaither were touring steadily as the Bill Gaither Trio, singing and recording songs Bill and Gloria had written. After touring with the Bill Gaither Trio for nearly thirty years, Gaither drew her focus to the Gaither Homecoming series. She has been an active presence in every video production.

The channel is based at the Fox Sports division's headquarters in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, California. The network was founded as Fuel TV on July 1, 2003, focusing on the culture of extreme sports, including skateboarding, snowboarding, wakeboarding, motocross, surfing, BMX and FMX. The network's prominence expanded further with the introduction of UFC mixed martial arts programming to its lineup in 2012 as part of a wider deal with Fox Sports. On August 17, 2013, Fuel TV was rebranded as Fox Sports 2, refocusing primarily as an overflow channel for the newly launched mainstream sports network Fox Sports 1. The relaunch of Fuel TV as FS1's sister network received little advanced promotion. As of September 2018, approximately 57.5 million households (62.3 percent of households with cable tv) receive Fox Sports 2.https://awfulannouncing.com/espn/nielsen-coverage-estimates-september-espn- nbcsn-nbatv-mlbn-nfln.html History =As Fuel TV= The network's concept originated in several extreme sports programming concepts. One of them originated from Alistair Gosling, founder of the Extreme Sports Channel and Extreme Sports TV distribution and production company Extreme. The concept, taken by Gosling to David Sternberg of Fox Sports Net, focused on expanding the coverage of extreme sports. This was translated into growing the existing programming block on the regional sports networks Fox Sports Net airing in the early evenings during the early 2000s on the network's affiliates, which included Blue Torch TV and EX TV, and combining it with brokered arrangements for individual shows which included among others New Waves Surf Television and 16MM, along with ideas from the Europe-based Extreme Sports Chanternberg, CJ Olivares and Lloyd Bryan Adams.Olivares Steps Down As Fuel TV General Manager , News Corporation Press, April 26, 2011.Stratus Media Group Hires New Senior Vice President of Entertainment, Business Wire, July 12, 2011. Another spoke was the network's name, from a concept conceived and launched by independent producer Chris Braly as a weekly regional music and extreme sports broadcast that debuted on September 8, 2001 on WB affiliate WFLI-TV (channel 53, now a CW affiliate) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, using paid programming time on that station on Saturday evenings. News Corporation eventually negotiated a buyout of the concept and trademark in late 2003. The regional weekly version of Fuel TV aired its final episode on WFLI in September of that year. The Fuel TV cable and satellite channel featured programs ranging from original series, exclusive events, licensed films and creative interstitials. Extreme sports programming was formerly the bulk of the network, with a diverse combination of sports, music, reality programming, extreme sports news and other content, including comedic programs. Beginning in late 2011, Fuel became the official cable home of the Ultimate Fighting Championship as part of a broader agreement between Fox and the mixed martial arts promotion, featuring pre- match and analysis programming involving the circuit such as the weekly UFC Tonight, along with undercard fights for UFC pay-per-view events. By the second half of 2012, Fuel TV's lineup consisted solely of combat sports (such as MMA and boxing) and reruns of reality programs from sister channel Speed. With the 2012‚Äì13 Premier League season, extra live and recorded Premier League matches were carried on Fuel TV, giving Fox Soccer three venues to carry live matches on Premier League match days; this began in May 2012 with Fuel carrying one of nine games on the final day of the Premier League season as part of Fox Sports's \\"Survival Sunday\\" effort to air all that day's Premier League matches across the division's cable properties. In March 2013, Fuel TV began adding weekly telecasts of rugby league matches from the Super League, the Championship, featuring clubs from, e.g. the United Kingdom and France, on Monday afternoons. =Relaunch as Fox Sports 2= In January 2013, alongside reports that Speed was to be replaced by a national sports network known as Fox Sports 1 (which was officially announced by Fox on March 5, 2013 for an August 17 launch), it was reported that Fox was planning to rebrand Fuel TV as a companion network ‚Äì Fox Sports 2 ‚Äì a name which Fox had filed a trademark application for on November 27, 2012. As opposed to the widely publicized launch of Fox Sports 1, the impending replacement of Fuel TV with Fox Sports 2 was met with relatively little fanfare, and was only announced roughly a week prior. The relaunch of the channel as Fox Sports 2 took place on August 17, 2013 at the same time that Speed was replaced by Fox Sports 1. Upon the relaunch, the channel was expanded into a mainstream sports service with a wider variety of content, although combat sports (such as UFC-related programs) remained an integral part of the lineup. Fuel's signature UFC program, UFC Tonight, moved over to Fox Sports 1 with the launch. The network's two highest-rated telecasts came from UFC events temporarily airing on FS2 due to overruns on FS1. The first bout of the UFC 200 preliminary card (moved due to baseball overruns on FS1) drew an average of 582,000 viewers, a network high. The first main card bout of UFC Fight Night: Swanson vs. Lobov also aired on FS2 in April 2017, drawing an average of 430,000 viewers. After the move of the rights for the UFC to ESPN and ESPN+ in 2019, its schedule has become more varied, and is less tied to a certain sport than in the past. Programming Fox Sports 2 features reruns of some of the news and analysis programs broadcast by Fox Sports 1. Sports programming post-UFC includes overflow coverage of events aired by Fox Sports 1, such as Big East basketball and NASCAR, along with second-tier programming that formerly would have aired as part of the Fox Sports Networks schedule. Fox Sports 2 also shows select ARCA Menards Series races live. Limited coverage of the Australian Football League moved to Fox Sports 2 from Fox Soccer Plus (simulcast from Australia via the Seven Network along with full coverage of the State of Origin series live from Australia's Nine Network. This move has proven popular with fans in the United States due to the growing fanbase for Australian rules football in the country. According to the websites of the Australian Football Association of North America and Fox Soccer Plus, Fox Sports has extended its current deal until 2016. Fox Sports 2 televised some regular season games and finals matches, while most of the 2015 season was aired on Fox Soccer Plus. As of 2019, UFC-related programming no longer airs on the channel due to UFC's new deal with ESPN which started that same year. In May 2018, it was reported that due to viewer backlash surrounding a preemption of part of a Washington/Stanford football game from FS1 to FS2 due to a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race, that Fox would now prefer using Fox Business Network (which has distribution more in line with FS1, and only carries non-critical paid programming on weekends) for Pac-12 overflow in the future. In 2020, Fox Sports 2 started broadcasting weekly Major League Rugby matches as well as reruns of the 1989 roller derby program RollerGames.

Kaye Scholer maintains a reputation for being a collegial firm, something of a rarity in law firms of its size and economic success. History The firm was founded in 1917 in New York by Benjamin Kaye and Jacob Scholer. Scholer was a graduate of New York Law School. Kaye was a graduate of Columbia Law School and an eminent banking lawyer who was among the first lawyers to bring a federal income tax case to trial under the 1913 income tax law. Kaye was also a noted playwright who wrote plays between tax cases. The firm was known as Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays and Handler for many years. In 1958 the firm moved into brand new offices at 425 Park Avenue, between 55th and 56th Streets. This becomes the firm's New York headquarters for the next 55 years, making it one of the longest business tenants at one locale in the city's history. In fall 2014, the firm left 425 Park Avenue and moved its New York headquarters to 250 West 55th Street. Kaye Scholer launched an office in Washington, D.C. in 1980 that now employs approximately 50 attorneys. Charges brought by the Office of Thrift Supervision against the firm in 1992 related to its representation of Charles Keating and his bank, Lincoln Savings and Loan, generated one of the most prominent legal ethics controversies of the decade.William H.

It is alternatively titled \\"Cuckoo\\" or \\"Sonatina,\\" and it is notable for its shortness.Piano Sonata No. 25, Op. 79 at IMSLP Movements It consists of three movements: It is one of Beethoven's shortest sonatas with an approximate performance time of only eleven minutes, if Beethoven's prescribed repeats are all observed. It is also the shortest of his sonatas with three movements. The first movement opens forcefully with a three-note motif (G‚ÄìB‚ÄìG) heard frequently throughout the movement. The second theme group in D major is based on fast scale and arpeggio passages and leads very swiftly into the forceful codetta. A few hesitant octave notes are played before the exposition repeats. The entire exposition is about 35 seconds long (without the repeat). The development section dominates this movement, being approximately 60 seconds long. It features frequent modulation as well as themes borrowed and fragmented from the exposition including the opening three note motive which is heard in the form of left-hand crossovers. This motive starts on E major, then moves on to B major seventh and later to C minor followed by G seventh, ending in a strange E major, B seventh combination. The recapitulation snaps the listener back to the home key forcefully with its opening three-note motif, then proceeds to repeat the exposition entirely in the home key. The development and recapitulation together are enclosed in a second, longer repeat mark. As a final touch, the coda features the main theme played in G major in the left hand with a treble clef, then the theme again in A minor in the right hand with bass accompaniment, then again with comedic acciaccatura inserted. The recapitulation and coda together take up approximately another minute. The whole movement with the exposition repeated lasts approximately three minutes. If the second repeat prescribed by Beethoven, encompassing the development and recapitulation, is observed, this brings the total performance time to around four and a half minutes. The andante movement, in G minor, uses a tranquil theme in time, quite uncommon in Beethoven's works, and a gentle, light atmosphere to present contrast to the ecstatic first movement. It is about two and a half minutes long. The finale movement is the most playful and the shortest at barely two minutes long. The movement is constructed in rondo form (ABACA‚Ä≤ and a coda), with a two-part theme and contrasting episodes in key (B) and in rhythm (C). A very brief coda brings this quick, lighthearted sonata to a brisk end. Beethoven later uses the chord progression found at the beginning of the A section to start his Sonata No. 30. A comparison of the two pieces gives a dramatic illustration of how Beethoven's piano-writing developed in the 11 years that intervened between the two sonatas. The Op. 109 theme is altogether subtler and subject to dramatic twists that lead the listener into quite unexpected harmonic territory.

It was released by IBM in 1964. It recorded text typed on 1/2\\" magnetic tape, approximately 25 kilobytes per tape cassette, and allowed editing and re-recording during playback. It was the first system marketed as a word processor. Most models had two tape drives, which greatly facilitated revision and enabled features such as mail merge. An add-on module added a third tape station, to record the combined output of playback from the two stations. The MT/ST automated word wrap, but it had no screen, automated hyphenation (soft hyphens were available), or concept of the page; pages had to be divided and numbered by the human operator during playback. Instruction manuals taught the operator the importance of listening to the sounds of the machine during playback. The backspace key backed up the tape so a character could be recorded over; there was also a true backspace code, which allowed overstruck characters, like √°. Insertion capabilities were limited: one could insert while copying from one tape station to the other; on a single tape one null character per line was reserved for insertions. A \\"switch code\\" instructed the playback to switch to the other tape drive. In a cumbersome way, points on the tape could be marked and jumped to. The MT/ST was not electronic; it implemented its functions through a bank of electromechanical relays. The MT/ ST was followed by the Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer, which differed only in output device, and for which it served as input. (Tapes prepared or edited on the MT/ST could be played back on the MT/SC.) It automated line justification, with three type sizes (10, 12, and 15 characters per inch), bold, italic (but not bold italic), and a variety of type styles (implemented using type \\"balls\\" similar to those of the Selectric typewriter) were made available within the budget of a medium-sized office or publisher. When printing a document, the machine would pause printing at the stop code and wait for an operator to change the Selectric-type ball and press a button telling the device to continue. In 1967 IBM hired Jim Henson to produce and direct a short film on the MT/ST; the film, called Paperwork Explosion, was scored by Raymond Scott. The first novel to be written on a word processor, Len Deighton's 1970 Second World War historical novel Bomber, about an RAF Bomber Command raid over Germany, was written on the MT/ST. The MT/ST was also used as a data entry device for early issues of the RILM Abstracts scholarly publication at the City University of New York Graduate Center. Cartridges created on the MT/ST were read by an IBM 2495 Tape Cartridge Reader onto an IBM 360 mainframe for further processing before being sent to be printed. The MT/ST became obsolete in the 1970s, when it was displaced by floppy disk-based systems. IBM discontinued support in 1983.

Few signs of the monastic buildings are visible today. The ruins that remain mostly consist of later additions when the structure served as a temporal dwelling and foresters' lodge. History There is a legend that it was founded in the Carolingian period, in about 750, by Saint Lioba, and some have argued that a few traces of architecture from that period survive. However, firm information on this place is available only from the 11th century, when the monastery, with some property to endow it, was given by Landgraf :de:Ludwig der B√§rtige of Sangerhausen or his sons Berengar and Ludwig to Hirsau Abbey, reportedly after the younger Ludwig had killed Markgraf Friedrich III during a hunt in 1065. After being incarcerated, Ludwig escaped. He founded Reinhardsbrunn Abbey near Coburg and possibly gifted his possession at Sch√∂nrain to Hirsau. Around 1100, abbot Wilhelm von Hirsau built the monastery, from which the monks served the whole region between Lohr, Gem√ºnden am Main and Karlstadt am Main. In 1159, Sch√∂nrain swapped property at nearby Massenbuch for Hofstetten (today both are part of Gem√ºnden). The local feudal lords were the Counts of Rieneck, kin of the founders, who persistently over the next centuries tried to acquire the property for themselves. They built a castle nearby to protect the priory. After a power struggle with the Bishop of W√ºrzburg, they had to demolish it in 1243. In 1376, the Rieneck family sold their local properties to W√ºrzburg, but retained the position of V√∂gte (or lay stewards) of Sch√∂nrain. Eventually, after severe damages sustained during the German Peasants' War, the then Abbot of Hirsau dissolved the monastery at Sch√∂nrain and sold the premises to Philipp von Rieneck in 1526, who re-built it as a residence for his wife Margaretha around 1535. After his death, it served as Margaretha's dowager house for another 15 years. In 1559, Sch√∂nrain came to Anton von Isenburg-B√ºdingen. When that family line failed in 1601, the site passed permanently to the Prince-Bishops of W√ºrzburg, who used it as accommodation for their forestry officials until 1625. It was heavily damaged in the Thirty Years' War and served as a local source of construction materials. The Bishopric was secularised in 1803 and Sch√∂nrain later continued in use by the forestry officials of the Kingdom of Bavaria. When their headquarters was moved elsewhere in 1818, the buildings at Sch√∂nrain were stripped for building materials, and the site has been in ruins since that time. Today Since 1973 the site and the ruins have been under the protection of a local environmental and historical preservation group, the Lohrer Heimatfreunde. The :de:Sch√∂nraintunnel, completed in 1993, passes beneath the ruins.

History WAPS first signed on in September 1955, part of a statewide educational broadcasting initiative which saw the launch of many school system-licensed radio stations across Ohio. From 1955 through the early 1980s, WAPS served as a ‚Äúradio classroom‚Äù service, operating only during school days and offering instructional radio programs that teachers could use in their classrooms. In the mid-1980s, the station evolved into a vocational program for high school broadcasting students, who served as on-air hosts, playing Top-40 music. In 1987, the station switched format to Alternative Rock/Modern Rock in the afternoons and evenings, and jazz in the morning hours. During this era, the station began broadcasting during the summer months as well as the school year. High school student broadcasters were augmented by college student broadcasters, and community volunteers. Weekend specialty and nationality broadcasts began with an abbreviated schedule in 1990, expanding to a full-day schedule by 1995. In 1992, WAPS began a slow evolution away from the ‚ÄúModern Rock‚Äù format towards the Album Adult Alternative format, completing the process in 1995. In 1996, the station began broadcasting 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. That same year, WAPS launched their first website, which soon offered live worldwide streaming audio of WAPS programs. In 1999, the station made a commitment to the Album Adult Alternative format under the branding of \\"91.3 The Summit\\". The website, www.wapsfm.com, was re-launched as www.913thesummit.com, though both addresses remain active. In 2001, WAPS hired local professional on-air hosts to broadcast during prime time hours, while continuing to use volunteers on weekends and evenings, supplemented by student interns and community volunteers behind the scenes. In 2011, another online worldwide radio service was launched, known as Rock & Recovery, designed to empower and entertain those suffering from addiction and enhance their self-motivation and personal nourishment. Rock & Recovery mixes stories and messages from professional health-care providers, addicts, comedians and family members. These stories and messages are woven in between hand-picked music. Rock & Recovery is not associated with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution. Rock & Recovery broadcasts on the WAPS HD-4 channel, and, is streamed worldwide at the website http://rockandrecovery.com In addition to being received locally on standard FM or new HD radios, a live broadcast of the main station as well as HD-only ‚ÄúSummit Flashbacks,\\" \\"KIDJAM!

While based on traditions over a thousand years old, the term was coined in the Meiji period of Imperial Japan, to distinguish such works from Western-style paintings or Y≈çga ().  History  The impetus for reinvigorating traditional painting by developing a more modern Japanese style came largely from many artist/educators, which included Shiokawa Bunrin, K≈çno Bairei, Tomioka Tessai and art critics Okakura Tenshin and Ernest Fenollosa, who attempted to combat Meiji Japan's infatuation with Western culture by emphasizing to the Japanese the importance and beauty of native Japanese traditional arts. These two men played important roles in developing the curricula at major art schools, and actively encouraged and patronized artists. Nihonga was not simply a continuation of older painting traditions. In comparison with Yamato-e the range of subjects was broadened. Moreover, stylistic and technical elements from several traditional schools, such as the Kan≈ç-ha, Rinpa and Maruyama ≈åkyo were blended together. The distinctions that had existed among schools in the Edo period were minimized. However, in many cases Nihonga artists also adopted realistic Western painting techniques, such as perspective and shading. Because of this tendency to synthesize, although Nihonga form a distinct category within the Japanese annual Nitten exhibitions, in recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to draw a distinct separation in either techniques or materials between Nihonga and Y≈çga. The artist Tenmyouya Hisashi has (b. 1966) developed a new art concept in 2001 called \\"Neo-Nihonga\\". = Development outside Japan = Nihonga has a following around the world; notable Nihonga artists who are not based in Japan are Hiroshi Senju, American artists such as Makoto Fujimura, Judith Kruger and Miyuki Tanobe and Indian artist Madhu Jain. Taiwanese artist Yiching Chen teaches workshops in Paris. Judith Kruger initiated and taught the course \\"Nihonga: Then and Now\\" at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and at the Savannah, Georgia Department of Cultural Affairs. Contemporary Nihonga has been the mainstay of New York's Dillon Gallery. Key artists from the \\"golden age of post war Nihonga\\" from 1985 to 1993 based at Tokyo University of the Arts have produced global artists whose training in Nihonga has served as a foundation. Takashi Murakami, Hiroshi Senju, Norihiko Saito, Chen Wenguang, Keizaburo Okamura and Makoto Fujimura are the leading artists exhibiting globally, all coming out of the distinguished Doctorate level curriculum at Tokyo University of the Arts. Most of these artists are represented by Dillon Gallery.  Materials  Nihonga are typically executed on washi (Japanese paper) or eginu (silk), using brushes. The paintings can be either monochrome or polychrome. If monochrome, typically sumi (Chinese ink) made from soot mixed with a glue from fishbone or animal hide is used. If polychrome, the pigments are derived from natural ingredients: minerals, shells, corals, and even semi-precious stones like malachite, azurite and cinnabar. The raw materials are powdered into 16 gradations from fine to sandy grain textures. A hide glue solution, called nikawa, is used as a binder for these powdered pigments. In both cases, water is used; hence nihonga is actually a water-based medium. Gofun (powdered calcium carbonate that is made from cured oyster, clam or scallop shells) is an important material used in nihonga. Different kinds of gofun are utilized as a ground, for under-painting, and as a fine white top color. Initially, nihonga were produced for hanging scrolls (kakemono), hand scrolls (emakimono), sliding doors (fusuma) or folding screens (by≈çbu). However, most are now produced on paper stretched onto wood panels, suitable for framing. Nihonga paintings do not need to be put under glass. They are archival for thousands of years.  Techniques  In monochrome Nihonga, the technique depends on the modulation of ink tones from darker through lighter to obtain a variety of shadings from near white, through grey tones to black and occasionally into greenish tones to represent trees, water, mountains or foliage. In polychrome Nihonga, great emphasis is placed on the presence or absence of outlines; typically outlines are not used for depictions of birds or plants. Occasionally, washes and layering of pigments are used to provide contrasting effects, and even more occasionally, gold or silver leaf may also be incorporated into the painting.

Introduced as a school boy in 1988, Ricky is one of the longest-running male protagonists to feature in EastEnders. Owen originally left the role in 2000 to pursue a music career. However, he reprised the role in 2002 before being axed by producer Louise Berridge in 2004. In 2008, producer Diederick Santer reintroduced the character for a third time, along with his wife Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). Ricky is portrayed as unintelligent, simplistic, easily led and bossed around by dominant personalities. On 26 February 2011, it was announced that Owen would take a temporary break from the show. The character exited on 19 July 2011, returning five months later on 13 December 2011. Ricky left EastEnders on 17 January 2012. Ricky returned to EastEnders on 20 June 2012 for the wedding of his sister, Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), before departing for the final time on 29 June 2012. In April 2016 he had voiced his interest in returning to EastEnders during an appearance on Celebrity Juice. Storylines =1988‚Äì2000= A teenage Ricky arrives in Albert Square when his father Frank Butcher (Mike Reid) becomes landlord of The Queen Victoria public house in May 1988. Non-academic, Ricky proves to be a troublesome teenager and is frequently berated by his father. He begins dating Shireen Karim (Nisha Kapur), an Asian Muslim, much to Shireen's father Ashraf's (Tony Wredden) disgust. Ashraf forces Shireen into an arranged marriage, prompting Ricky to retaliate by terrorizing Ashraf for a while with a gang of racists. Later on, Ricky shows talent mending cars, so the Mitchell brothers, Phil (Steve McFadden) and Grant (Ross Kemp), take him on at their auto repair shop as an apprentice mechanic in 1990. Ricky begins dating the Mitchell brothers' younger sister Sam (Danniella Westbrook) and when she decides she wants to get married at 16, she and Ricky elope to Gretna Green in 1991. Their marriage is short-lived, as Sam grows bored and starts to look for entertainment elsewhere; she leaves Ricky in 1993. Despite a one-night stand with Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) in January 1994, Ricky does not enter into another serious relationship until August, when he begins dating Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer). They move in together, but when Bianca begins to treat Ricky badly, he begins an affair with her best friend Natalie Price (Lucy Speed), in 1995. Natalie falls in love with Ricky and sets it up so that Bianca catches them kissing. Furious, Bianca finishes with Ricky, cutting up all his clothes and, after Ricky rejects Natalie, she flees Walford. Bianca eventually forgives Ricky and they reunite. Bianca strays with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), but immediately realises her mistake and marries Ricky on 17 April 1997. Later that year Bianca falls pregnant, but a prenatal scan reveals her unborn baby has both spina bifida and hydrocephalus; the Butchers decide to terminate the pregnancy. The trauma devastates them both, but it does bring them closer and in September 1998 Bianca discovers she has fallen pregnant again, resulting in her prematurely giving birth to their son Liam on Christmas Day 1998. The following year, Ricky becomes acquainted with Bianca's mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson) and her boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). He quickly gets along with the pair, but this changes when Carol tells him that Bianca and Dan have embarked on an affair - as the pair had previously had a relationship prior to Dan falling in love with Carol. When the affair becomes public knowledge, the Butchers' marriage ends and Bianca departs with Liam for Manchester. Ricky, devastated by his marriage breakdown, begins to clash with Dan when the latter taunts him - as well as becoming unhappy with his own life and work. This escalates when Ricky learns that Phil has recently befriended Dan, who later tells Ricky that Phil and Frank have been working together on a motor scam. In response, Ricky confronts Phil and the two have an argument as Ricky attempts to leave Walford. Phil apologizes to Ricky for hurting him and promises that he'll deal with Dan for him. Ricky initially agrees to return to Walford, but secretly leaves without Phil's consent. =\\"Ricky & Bianca\\"= In May 2002, Ricky arrives to Bianca‚Äôs flat in Manchester to visit Liam alongside his fianc√©e - Cassie. He discovers that Bianca has stolen ¬£50,000 of drug money from her boss, Vince. An unimpressed Ricky convinces Bianca to return the money before she gets hurt. Vince sends the pair to a drug deal which is a set up. Ricky and Bianca escape to a hotel where they briefly rekindle their romance. Bianca reveals that she is struggling as a single parent and is manipulated by Cassie into believing that Ricky's life would be ruined if Bianca returns to him. Bianca decides to leave Liam with Ricky and hitches a ride to a destination unknown. =2002‚Äì2004= Ricky returns to Walford in August 2002 with Liam after hearing from his former stepmother Pat Evans (Pam St. Clement), that his sister Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks) has resorted to prostitution and drug abuse. Ricky remains to help Janine and returns to his old job as a mechanic at the Arches. He begins a second affair with Natalie, which ruins her marriage to Roy's son Barry (Shaun Williamson). By then, Roy and Pat have formed a marriage together. Roy soon passes away after suffering a fatal heart attack amid learning about the affair and that Pat had kept it secret at the time she found out about it herself. Ricky and Natalie subsequently plan to leave Walford together in 2003, but when Janine informs Natalie about Ricky's one-night stand with his ex-wife Sam (now Kim Medcalf), an outraged Natalie dumps him. Janine goes on to marry Barry for his money and accidentally kills him during an argument. Discovering his sister's role in Barry's death, Ricky disowns Janine and leaves Walford again in February 2004 - horrified and ashamed. =2008‚Äì2012= On 31 March 2008, Ricky returns to Walford unexpectedly with his sister Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence) to inform Pat that Frank has died. Frank is cremated in Walford the following day. Ricky's fianc√©e Melinda (Siobhan Hayes) attends, but soon finishes with Ricky when she discovers he is penniless. The Butcher siblings and Pat scatter Frank's ashes in Albert Square gardens after the reading of his will. Ricky returns the following week when he discovers Bianca and Liam are living with Pat after being made homeless. Despite initial hostilities, Ricky helps Bianca regain custody of her four children, who have been put into care, and then decides to remain in Walford himself, to be near Liam. Ricky hopes for a reconciliation with Bianca, but she is involved with Tony King (Chris Coghill), and when Tony is released from prison later that year, he moves in with the Butchers. Unbeknown to the rest of the family, Tony is a paedophile and is having a secret relationship with Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty). When this is uncovered, Bianca finishes with Tony and he is imprisoned. Bianca reveals that her youngest daughter, Tiffany (Maisie Smith), is actually the daughter of Ricky, conceived on their one-night stand in 2002. This is confirmed when Ricky takes a paternity test. Phil orders Ricky to locate Sam in Brazil and he brings her home with him. When Bianca is about to admit her love for him, Ricky reveals that he loves Sam. Ricky and Sam get engaged. However, Sam embarks on an affair with Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and when Bianca discovers this, she tells Ricky and the engagement is called off. Bianca surprises Ricky by proposing and they marry for a second time in February 2010. Ricky then discovers Sam is pregnant. It is unknown whether Ricky or Jack fathered Sam's baby. To Bianca's chagrin, Sam names Ricky as the father, but a paternity test reveals she is lying and the baby is Jack's. When Bianca is jailed for attacking Connor Stanley (Arinze Kene) in 2011, Ricky struggles to support his children, so he accepts a job in Dubai where he is arrested for indecency after being caught swimming naked in the sea. He is fined and deported, leaving him with no money upon his return to Walford. From prison, Bianca blames her family's money problems on Ricky, and Ricky seeks comfort from Mandy who has returned to Walford. After reliving their youth and taking drugs, Ricky and Mandy have sex again. Later, Mandy confesses that their one-night stand in 1994 left her pregnant, but their baby daughter, Kira, died shortly after birth. Ricky immediately regrets having sex with Mandy and decides not to tell Bianca upon her release from prison; however, Bianca discovers the truth on New Year's Day 2012, the same night the Butchers are left distraught by Pat's death from cancer. Following Pat's funeral, Bianca realises she cannot forgive Ricky's latest infidelity; she ends their marriage, forcing Ricky to leave Walford. He returns in June for Janine's wedding to Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), along with Tiffany, Morgan and Diane. Janine goes into premature labour and Ricky sits with his newborn niece, Scarlett Moon, as she fights for survival. Later, he argues with Morgan's biological father, Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn), about their parenting methods, but they call a truce. He becomes Scarlett's godfather at her baptism before leaving with the children again. In August 2015, he agrees to let Liam and his girlfriend Cindy Williams (Mimi Keene) live with him in Germany. He advises Liam against taking money from the Beales and offers to train him to become a mechanic. Creation and development =Background= EastEnders had been on air for three years before the character of Ricky made his first screen appearance in May 1988. At the time, big changes were occurring \\"behind-the-scenes\\". Co-creator Julia Smith took \\"a more back-seat role\\" as Series Producer, which allowed producer Mike Gibbon to take control of the making of the programme. The arrival of the Butcher family in May 1988 signified an end of an era for the soap, as Den and Angie Watts vacated their positions as landlord and landlady of The Queen Victoria public house, leaving the head of the Butcher family, Frank (Mike Reid), and his girlfriend Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement) to take over. Along with Frank came his two teenage children, Ricky (Sid Owen) and Diane (Sophie Lawrence). Later they were joined by Frank's mother Mo (Edna Dor√©), and Frank's youngest daughter Janine (Rebecca Michael). Owen was 16 when he first appeared as Ricky in EastEnders. =Personality= Portrayed as a soft touch and unintellectual, the character has been dubbed \\"thicky Ricky\\" by the popular press in the UK ‚Äî in the serial he failed all his GCSEs. Sid Owen has discussed Ricky's intellect: \\"Ricky is just a sort of lovable innocent, really. He's just bungling his way through life the best way he can. All right, so he'll never win any prizes for his brain power. So what? He's a good bloke, a good mate to his friends and he can work miracles with motors [...] What you see is what you get where he's concerned.\\" Author Kate Lock has described Ricky as hapless and a figure of fun, \\"completely lacking in tact and rarely opens his mouth without putting his foot in it.\\" Noting the changes his character went through in 2000, Owen said, \\"[Ricky] grew up over the years just as all of us have to change. He became more sensitive and more mature.\\" =Marriage to Sam Mitchell= Ricky as he appeared in 1988. During the early 1990s, Ricky's narrative concentrated upon his teen elopement to Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook). Westbrook has said that \\"the public couldn't get enough of the simmering relationship between Ricky and Sam and the show was inundated with calls from the press [...] [Sam and Ricky] were involved in a plotline about under-age sex, so the press swooped in on that.\\" To the anger of her family, Sam persuaded Ricky to elope to Gretna Green in July 1991. The week's worth of episodes focusing on their marriage were filmed on-location and have been described by former EastEnders scriptwriter, Colin Brake, as a \\"farce-like chase round the country\\". Written by Debbie Cook, the storyline saw Ricky and Sam's families, including Sam's mother Peggy (Jo Warne; introduced specifically for this plotline) attempting to stop the couple from saying \\"I do\\". The storyline climaxed in the registry office wedding, but despite the Scottish setting, the recording of the episodes took place in Hertfordshire. Later in the month, Sam and Ricky had a more official \\"grand church blessing\\" with all their family in attendance. The Butchers' blessing was screened in the same episode as the funeral of another character, Charlie Cotton. The marriage was portrayed as problematic, fraught with interference from their families, lack of money, and Ricky's jealousy of Sam's partying and her modeling career, including a topless photoshoot. In 1993 Westbrook left the soap. On-screen, Sam's marriage to Ricky ended following an affair with a yuppie named Clive (Sean Gallagher). =Marriage to Bianca Jackson= Ricky's relationship with Bianca Jackson (Patsy Palmer) has been central to his narrative; their affiliation began in 1994. Palmer and Owen already knew each other before working together on the soap, as both attended the Anna Scher theatre school. Owen has said, \\"We practically grew up together. We'd known each other for years. It was weird when she started on the show and we began playing the 'Ricky & Bianca Get To Know Each Other' bit. I had already spent a lot of time with Patsy. I think we were both seven when we met.\\" The dynamics of their relationship were clear from the start, with Bianca portrayed as the dominant, bossy and authoritative partner, while Ricky was shown as the hen-pecked, dim-witted \\"loser\\" or \\"soft touch\\", comically under the thumb of his female counterpart. James Rampton from The Independent has commented, \\"to her eternally put-upon husband, Ricky, Bianca was a ferocious reincarnation of H Rider Haggard's 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'.\\" Bianca was notorious for shouting the catchphrase \\"Rickaaaaaaay!\\" (a cockney pronunciation of Ricky) at her lover. It has been suggested that Bianca's catchphrase ‚Äî \\"Rickaaaaaaay!\\" ‚Äî transitioned, becoming \\"shorthand for any sort of heinous henpecking.\\" The wedding of Ricky and Bianca was watched by 22 million viewers in April 1997. One of the first notable storylines featuring the couple occurred in 1995, when Ricky embarked on an affair with Bianca's \\"put-upon sidekick\\", Natalie Price (Lucy Speed). On-screen Natalie and Ricky found themselves sidelined and bullied by Bianca, forcing them together and leading to their eventual affair, which continued for several weeks on-screen, with Ricky seeing both Natalie and Bianca. The storyline reached its climax on 21 February 1995; 17.0 million viewers tuned in to witness Bianca discovering that her boyfriend was sleeping with her best friend. The characters were shown to reconcile later in the year when Ricky supported Bianca through a personal crisis ‚Äî the revelation that she had unknowingly tried to seduce her estranged father David Wicks (Michael French). Various crises between the characters were featured over the following years, causing them to break up and reconcile numerous times. In the book Seeing Things: Television in the Age of Uncertainty, author John Ellis uses the couple's combustible relationship as an example of emotional intensity and pathos: \\"A couple like Ricky and Bianca...can have constantly sniped at each other for several episodes, for no apparent dramatic purpose except that it is the nature of their relationship. Then they will suddenly be confronted by a life-changing decision...There is suddenly a shift in emotional intensity for the audience. Every word now counts, and all the previous audience attitudes of irritation or even condescension to this 'not very bright couple'...become a feeling of utter absorption in their dilemma.\\" The BBC has reported that Bianca and Ricky's on-off romance \\"captivated millions of fans\\", and in April 1997 22 million viewers tuned in to see them marry on-screen, one of the biggest soap audiences ever. In 2000, Owen stated that the storyline he most enjoyed in EastEnders was the build up and marriage to Bianca, because \\"the public's enthusiasm for the event was a great motivation\\". The couple have been described as \\"iconic\\". In 1997, the couple were featured in a storyline about spina bifida and hydrocephalus, a developmental birth defect resulting in an incompletely formed spinal cord of the baby. After falling pregnant with Ricky's baby, a pre-natal scan revealed that her unborn foetus had the conditions. In the storyline, Bianca and Ricky agonised about whether to have an abortion, but eventually decided to terminate the pregnancy at 20 weeks, following the diagnosis. In scenes shown after the abortion, Bianca and Ricky were given the chance to see and hold their dead daughter, named Natasha, after the birth (Ricky was unable to do this, though Bianca later said her baby had been \\"perfect\\"), and a period of heavy grief followed as the characters came to terms with what they had done. The Peterborough-based Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (ASBAH) helped and provided information to the programme makers during the storyline. Despite the birth of a premature but healthy baby, Liam, in an episode that aired on Christmas Day 1998, the following year the couple split following Bianca's affair, Palmer having decided to leave EastEnders. =Departure (2000)= In September 1999, it was announced that actor Sid Owen would be quitting his role as Ricky Butcher, after 12 years on-screen; his decision to leave was announced two weeks after Patsy Palmer's departing episode aired. Ricky was not killed off in the serial, as the producers opted to give the actor an open-ended storyline, enabling him to return. An EastEnders' spokesperson claimed that \\"Owen's decision to take a break from filming had been reached in mutual agreement with EastEnders' bosses\\". Owen stated, \\"I love playing Ricky Butcher but it will be good to take off his overalls for a while. After 12 years, two failed marriages and two children, I'm looking forward to some time off - but also my return to Walford.\\" Executive producer at the time, Matthew Robinson, said, \\"Viewers have come to love the character of Ricky Butcher due to Sid's wonderful acting. We wish Sid luck in any forthcoming projects and look forward to welcoming Ricky back to EastEnders in due course.\\" Penned scripts for Ricky's exit in April 2000 had to be rewritten to account for the absence of Mike Reid who played Ricky's father Frank. The storyline initially planned to have Frank and Ricky involved in one of EastEnders renowned two-hander episodes, but due to Reid's off-screen ill-health, Steve McFadden, who plays Phil Mitchell, had to stand in for the episode, which saw Ricky flee Walford.\\"REID QUITS IN FURY AS BBC KO'S CHARITY TRIP\\", Sunday Mirror. Retrieved 8 November 2006. Of his departing episode, Owen stated that he was pleased Ricky's final scenes featured just him and Phil (Steve McFadden). He comments, \\"both Phil and Ricky have had babies, broken marriages and loads of ups and downs in their lives, and it was good to talk about it all in that episode. It's a brilliant script [...] I burst out crying, really sobbing\\". =Reintroduction and axing (2002‚Äì2004)= In 2001, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer and Sid Owen were reprising their roles as Bianca and Ricky, for a special spin-off, entitled EastEnders: Ricky & Bianca. Filmed in Manchester in January 2002, the two part, hour-long special reunited the characters for the first time in over two years. The spin-off or 'soap bubble' was part of Mal Young's (BBC's controller of drama serials) plan to expand the EastEnders brand ‚Äî he created a \\"bubbles unit\\" to make, at most, six one-off specials a year. EastEnders: Ricky & Bianca aired in May 2002, and proved a ratings winner, with more than 10 million viewers tuning in. In the spin-off, Bianca had fallen upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky embroiled in a drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by Craig Charles, and Ricky's fianc√©e Cassie, played by Sally Ann Triplett. The spin-off paved the way for Ricky to return to EastEnders as a regular character in 2002, without Bianca. The most notable storyline featuring the character during this period was a second affair with Natalie Evans (Lucy Speed), breaking up her marriage to Barry Evans (Shaun Williamson). In a plot twist, this affair ended in disaster when Ricky was caught having a one-night stand with his ex-wife Sam (Kim Medcalf). In October 2003, a year after the character had returned, the BBC announced that they were axing the character of Ricky due to \\"limited possibilities\\". Executive producer Louise Berridge said, \\"one of our most enduringly successful characters. We will be very sorry to say goodbye to Sid, who has been one of the most amiable and popular of our cast members since his return to the show [...] the door is being left firmly open for his return in the future.\\" Owen said, \\"I have enjoyed my time back on the show but now it is time to see a bit more of the world and spend time on my other projects.\\" The character was written out in scenes that aired in February 2004, Owen being one of many actors to quit or be axed by Louise Berridge that year. =Reintroduction and departure (2008‚Äì2012)= It was announced on 29 October 2007 that Patsy Palmer would be reprising the role of Bianca in EastEnders. A day later, it was announced that Sid Owen would also be returning to the show as Ricky. Owen commented: \\"It will be interesting to see what has been happening to Ricky and Bianca over the last few years. Although, I must admit I'm not looking forward to her nagging me by shouting his name.\\" Executive producer Diederick Santer commented: \\"First Patsy comes home, now Sid! Ricky and Bianca were a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show [...] Seeing Bianca back on the show is exciting in itself, but to throw Ricky into the equation gives things an added dimension. Ricky's a great and much-loved character in his own right, but what's really exciting to me is the two of them together. There's so much history, drama and passion to explore [...] There'll always be a connection between Ricky and Bianca\\". To promote the characters' return, the BBC began airing trailers across the BBC network in March 2008. One trailer utilised Bianca's \\"trademark holler\\" of Ricky's name, which is so loud that it smashes the windows of The Queen Victoria public house. The trailer featured the Righteous Brothers' song \\"Hung on You\\". Ricky's return in March 2008 was scripted to coincide with the funeral of his father Frank, following his actor Mike Reid's death in 2007. The episodes, dubbed Frank week, reunited various former cast members on-screen for the event, including actors Sophie Lawrence and Charlie Brooks, who returned as Frank's daughters Diane and Janine respectively. Simultaneously, the plight of Bianca and her children was aired, documenting her permanent return to EastEnders and subsequently leading to Ricky's permanent return, as he moved back to be near his son Liam. Bianca and Ricky married for the second time in February 2010, during the week of the show's 25th anniversary. Santer explained that he wanted great stories to get people talking, saying \\"That's [...] why we're doing the soap wedding of the year -- and perhaps the soap wedding of the decade -- with Ricky and Bianca. The romance played against the thriller story is a great balance, which I hope the audience will be both gripped by and satisfied with.\\" On 26 February 2011, it was announced Owen will take a break from EastEnders until the end of 2011, to focus on charity work. He departed on 19 July 2011, returning for a brief stint on 13 December 2011 before leaving again on 17 January 2012. Owen's character returned once again in June 2012. Reception In 2006, Ricky Butcher was voted as the UK's favourite soap opera car mechanic in a poll of 500 people organised by car hire firm, Lingscar. 36% voted for Ricky above Kevin Webster from Coronation Street (Michael Le Vell) who scored 34%; EastEnders' Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) with 12%, and Kylie Minogue's Charlene Robinson from Neighbours with 7%. In 2008, when it was announced that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, executive producer Diederick Santer described them as \\"a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show\\". Other media sources branded them two of \\"the most popular characters on the soap\\" and an \\"iconic couple\\". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, \\"It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?\\". Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved characters back \\"is very welcome\\". He comments, \\"Previous returns have been all about the numbers and not about the story, which is the cardinal sin in this game. While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect to see over the next couple of years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] I sense friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (how could he?). All very well thought through and positive. This sounds like a soap getting back in touch with its roots.\\". In 2009, Ruth Deller of entertainment website lowculture.co.uk, who runs a monthly feature of the most popular and unpopular soap opera characters, profiled Ricky praising his new family dynamic, stating: \\"Who would have ever thought 'thicky Ricky' would have made a best characters list? The return of the Jackson/Butcher/King clan has been very welcome, and Ricky's turn as a doting dad figure has actually proved remarkably touching.\\" References External links * Category:Male characters in television Category:Television characters introduced in 1988 Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional mechanics Category:Fictional taxicab drivers Category:Teenage characters in television ","title":"Ricky Butcher"},{"id":"3627706","text":"Alfred Ollivant Alfred Ollivant monument in Llandaff Cathedral Alfred Ollivant (1798 - 16 December 1882) was an academic who went on to become Bishop of Llandaff. Born in Manchester, he was educated at St Paul's School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He won the Tyrwhitt Hebrew scholarship in 1822 and was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College. In 1827, he was appointed the first vice-principal of St David's College, Lampeter. Whilst at Lampeter, he found time to learn the Welsh language and he preached regularly in that language at Llangeler, where he later became vicar. He returned to Cambridge in 1843 as Regius Professor of Divinity, but in 1849 he was nominated to the see of Llandaff, primarily because of his knowledge of Wales and of the Welsh language. Ollivant was instrumental in the move to construct churches (often by private benefactions from industrialists and landowners) in the newly populated areas of his diocese. A good example was St Elvan's Church, Aberdare, where Ollivant officiated at the opening services in 1852. As Bishop of Llandaff, Ollivant wrote a book, Some Account of the Condition of the Fabric of Llandaff Cathedral, from 1575 to the present time, intended to raise funds to reestablish a choir at Llandaff Cathedral, where there had been none since 1691, and to purchase an organ for the cathedral, which had been without one for some time. He died on 16 December 1882, and was buried on 21 December in the Cathedral grounds. A monument of his image was placed in the chancel of the Cathedral, near the high altar, and remarkably it escaped damage when the cathedral was bombed in 1941.

Power (March 22, 1909 - May 15, 1997) was a politician, office holder, farmer, poet and athlete, who was born in Dunville, Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. Power represented Placentia and St. Mary's from 1951 to 1956 and Placentia East from 1956 to 1959 in the Newfoundland House of Assembly. The son of William and Gertrude Power, he was educated in St. John's and at Memorial University College. Power married Mary Ellen Crosbie. He was considered Joey Smallwood's right-hand man in the battle for Confederation of Newfoundland with Canada. He served as editor of the pro-Confederation newspaper The Confederate and wrote numerous editorial letters to local newspapers under the pseudonym \\"Housewife\\". His forte was satirical poetry. Power ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the 1949 Federal election in St. John's West. Failing to win a seat he was instead appointed the first chairman of the Newfoundland Liquor Corporation. He was elected to the House of Assembly for Placentia East in the 1951 Provincial election and became Minister of Finance. He later served a Minister of Highways during the extensive expansion of Newfoundland's road system during the 1950s. Power resigned from cabinet in 1959 and became critical of Smallwood. Power was twice winner of the O'Leary Newfoundland Poetry Award and endowed the Gregory J. Power Poetry Award, an annual competition at Memorial University of Newfoundland that aims to recognize and encourage young poets. He had a regular column in the newspaper The Evening Telegram. Power represented Newfoundland in the 1930 British Empire Games placing fifth out of six competitors in the triple jump. Several of his Newfoundland records were never broken prior to the switch to metric distances and as a result, still stand. He was inducted into the Newfoundland Sports Hall of Fame in 1983. He also owned Mary's Poultry Farms Ltd. With facilities in St. John's, Logy Bay and Dunville, Newfoundland. It was one of the largest egg producing operations in Atlantic Canada. Power was awarded an honorary doctorate (LL.D.) at the Memorial University of Newfoundland Spring 1995 Convocation. He died May 15, 1997 in St. John's at the age of 88.

The Freedom Charter was drawn up at the gathering, which was statement of core principles of the Alliance and a symbol of internal resistance against apartheid. Background In 1953 prominent black academic Z. K. Matthews proposed that a \\"Congress of the People\\" be organised to gather and document the wishes of the people. Organising committees were set up across South Africa. A call was sent out to the people of South Africa by the group later known as the Congress Alliance for proposals for the content of a freedom charter concerning issues such as land, industry, human rights, education and law. Proposals were received in the form of local demands, in the form of new constitutions, as documents and scraps of papers and these proposals were then developed by a sub-committee into a draft document that could be debated at a future Congress of the People. On 23 June 1955, executives of the ANC, the South African Indian Congress (SAIC), the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU), the Coloured People's Congress (CPC) and the South African Congress of Democrats (COD) met in Tongaat. This group, who later became known as the Congress Alliance, developed the document known as the Freedom Charter and planned a large multi-racial gathering to be held over two days at Kliptown on 26 June 1955, where it was intended that the Charter be ratified after being read out and discussed. The draft proposal for the Charter was presented to each delegate when they arrived in Johannesburg for the Congress. The delegates were elected from rural and urban areas, elected by their communities or organisations with funds raised locally to get their representatives to Johannesburg. Where this was not possible, delegates from communities already present in the city were found. 26 June 1955 The Congress of the People, consisting of around 3,000 people, gathered in Kliptown, part of Soweto (a large Township (South Africa) outside Johannesburg) on 26 June 1955 in a field surrounded by chicken-wire to give it a lawful claim of being a private gathering, so that it was not prevented from assembling by the South African government. The delegates came from all parts of the country, arriving in Johannesburg via car, bus, bicycle, by foot and horseback. The majority of the people in the gathering were black South Africans, with hundreds Indian South Africans, whites and so-called \\"Coloureds\\". The object of the Congress was to adopt a Freedom Charter representing the aspirations of South Africans of all races. The aim was to have a lead speaker present each section of the proposed charter and to open the section to general discussion and debate by the gathering. This did not happen due to the intervention by the government, and each section was instead agreed to, but not by general discussion. Albert Luthuli, Yusuf Dadoo and Father Trevor Huddleston were all honoured with the ANC's highest honour, Isitwalandwe, but only Huddleston was able to receive his, the other two being subject to banning orders issued by the government. The Congress concluded on 27 June, when the gathering was surrounded by the South African Police and broken up. They made several arrests, confiscated documents and photographed the delegates. Ratification of the Charter The last aim of the Congress was to collect a million signatures by 26 June 1956 to acknowledge the creation of the Freedom Charter. A quota of signatures was decided upon with the following required from each province: Transvaal 450,000; Cape Province 350,000; Natal 150,000 and the Orange Free State 50,000. The delegates then returned home to report back to their communities or organisations to spread the adoption of the Freedom Charter. By the end of 1955, 156 leading Congress Alliance activists were arrested and tried for treason in the 1956 Treason Trial; the Charter itself was used as evidence and eventually declared illegal. Significance of the event The Congress of the People led to the Congress movement assuming a fully non-racial character for the first time. From this people's meeting and Charter was born a truly national liberation movement with the aim of a complete social transformation, requiring a radical restructuring of all aspects of South African society. .

It was launched on February 25, 2004 and catered to the Latino community with exclusively English-language programming. It ended operations on September 30, 2015 when its programming merged with Fuse; the channel space was replaced with the new channel concept, FM. History =Beginnings as a production company (1997‚Äì2003)= Founded by American entrepreneurs Jeff Valdez and Bruce Barshop, S√≠ TV was established in 1997 as a production company to develop, produce and distribute original English-language entertainment aimed primarily at a Latino audience. In 1998, the company produced two half-hour bilingual programs ‚Äì the talk show Cafe Ole with Giselle Fernandez and the comedy series Funny Is Funny ‚Äì for the Spanish-language cable channel Galavisi√≥n. The two series, which dealt primarily with Latino culture in the United States, helped boost Galavisi√≥n's audience share on weekends in the 18‚Äì34 Latino demographic by 83%. When S√≠ TV and Galavisi√≥n parted ways in August of that year, Valdez sold the shows into national syndication in 52 markets, drawing solid ratings in New York City, Miami, Houston, and San Antonio. On March 10, 1999, S√≠ TV announced plans to launch the first English-language cable network aimed at young Latinos. Valdez expressed interest in debuting the channel during the first quarter of 2000. George A. Greenberg of Newberger Greenberg & Associates, a media advisory firm that helped develop the Sci-Fi Channel prior to its August 1992 launch, said the network was expected to initially be available to approximately 6 million U.S. homes. Greenberg estimated that it would cost about $30 million to get S√≠ TV \\"up and running\\" and another $70 million to operate it for its first three years. According to Los Angeles Times columnist Kevin Baxter, although Latinos make up 11% of the population of the United States, and \\"their numbers are growing six times faster than the population at large\\", there have been few attempts to develop programming of \\"relevance to the acculturated segment of that community\\". Esther Renteria, chairwoman of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, stated that: \\"I think there's a need for S√≠ TV, but whether it's too soon or not, I don't know\\". S√≠ TV's production of the Nickelodeon sitcom The Brothers Garc√≠a (which ran from 2000 to 2004), made television history as the first English-language sitcom with a cast and creative team of writers, directors and producers made entirely of Latinos. In January 2003, it was announced that S√≠ TV would be launched nationally on satellite provider Dish Network at the beginning of that summer. Valdez stated that: \\"For years, people have ignored the young demographic that doesn't speak Spanish but needs a voice and wants a place to call home\\". =Launch as a cable television network (2004‚Äì10)= S√≠ TV logo used from 2004 to 2008. S√≠ TV was launched as a cable network on February 25, 2004, becoming the first exclusively English-language cable channel catering to the Latino community. It became a bicultural alternative to Spanish- language networks such as Univision and Telemundo. According to Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club, the channel is marketed toward audiences who \\"enjoy a Spanish flavor without all the actual Spanish\\". S√≠ TV's target audience of young adults aged 18‚Äì34 are \\"presumably those who have long since assimilated into American convention\\", and who \\"don't necessarily have any particular fealty to the sort of programming that goes to great lengths to remind them of their heritage ‚Äì unlike their first-generation parents or grandparents\\". Within three months of its launch, S√≠ TV had seven million subscribers nationwide. In April 2004, S√≠ TV announced that it had secured more than $60 million in financing from a large group that includes \\"major pay\\" television distributors and several private equity investors, including Time Warner, EchoStar Communications and DND Equity Partners. That August, S√≠ TV hired Rori Peters (who began her career in commercial banking, was previously a vice president at Comedy Central, worked for Court TV and served as a 2002 national chairperson for Women in Cable) as its vice president of affiliate relations. In this role, she was responsible for developing the department and increasing the network's subscriber base. In August 2005, the network appointed Michael Schwimmer (a former top lieutenant at EchoStar Communications) as its CEO. In April 2006, Valdez stepped down as head of programming of S√≠ TV. Edward R. Leon, the network's senior vice president of production, assumed the additional role of acting head of programming. S√≠ TV logo used from 2008 to 2011. During the 2008 presidential election, S√≠ TV teamed up with voter registration organization, Voto Latino, to mount a \\"Crash the Parties\\" contest to pick two Latino \\"political junkies\\" to serve as reporters for the channel at the Democratic and Republican National Conventions. Video entries were judged by the public and a panel, including CNN anchor Rick Sanchez, actress Rosario Dawson, Craigslist's Craig Newmark, former Texas congressman Henry Bonilla, YouTube's Steve Grove and Republican National Hispanic Assembly chairman Danny Vargas. The contest awarded S√≠ TV national impact. S√≠ TV and Voto Latino also hosted a series of registration events in Chicago, Phoenix, Sacramento, San Jose and San Diego. According to SNL Kagan, in 2009, the network was estimated to have earned more than $15 million in net ad sales revenue. =Relaunch as NUVOtv (2011‚Äì13)= On January 18, 2011, Telemundo ad sales veteran Craig Geller was named S√≠ TV's senior vice president of advertising sales. Of his move, Geller stated that: \\"It's the right time in the right market and S√≠ TV is the right network. The marketplace is poised for explosive growth and the 2010 Census will validate the fact that bicultural Latinos are absolutely the fastest-growing demo in the U.S.\\" He further stated that the job \\"was an opportunity he couldn‚Äôt pass up\\". He commented: \\"Having been a student of the marketplace for as many years as I have, I recognized that the network is ready to take a huge leap forward. At the same time, our audience is growing tremendously. The time has come for advertisers to embrace these consumers, in a culturally relevant way, and the place to do that is S√≠ TV\\". In March 2011, the channel reached approximately 25 to 27 million households, according to its senior vice president of marketing Rafael Oller. The network expected to reach 30 million households by the end of 2011; a milestone that would make it eligible to be rated by Nielsen and would therefore be of more interest to advertisers. On July 4, 2011, the network underwent a rebrand and changed its name to NUVOtv (\\"nuvo\\" being a portmanteau of \\"NUevo\\" and \\"VOice\\", reflecting \\"the dual cultural pillars of today's American Bi-Cultural Latinos\\"), in a \\"bid to better pursue bicultural Latino audiences\\".http://www.thecab.tv/php/networkprofiles/12profileData/2012pdf/12NuvoTV.pdf The name change was their part of an effort to tackle the power of the United States' growing Latino population. Oller stated that: \\"Most everyone is focused on total U.S. Hispanics, but the real story is the bicultural Latino. Three out of four speak English well or very well. These bicultural Latinos self-identify as Latino and American and are looking for culturally relevant programming\\". In August 2012, nuvoTV announced that they had raised $40 million from current investors, Columbia Capital LLC and Rho Capital Partners Inc., and new investors, Veronis Suhler Stevenson LLC and Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC. NUVOtv logo used from 2011 to 2013. On September 11, NUVOtv announced a premier partnership with entertainer and entrepreneur Jennifer Lopez, which would focus on appealing the network's programming to a modern, Latino audience that is \\"growing rapidly and in need of new, high-quality content\\". Lopez would work on the creative side of the network, managing marketing and program production with her production company, Nuyorican Productions, as well as periodically appearing on programs featured on the network's programming. According to The Huffington Post, with a growing Latino audience, \\"there is more demand for television programming around that audience. Until now, there have only been a few networks focused on this demographic, and really none focused on providing Latino cultural content in English\\". Lopez told USA Today that when she was growing up there was very little programming that appealed to her heritage, stating that: \\"Growing up in the Bronx as a little Puerto Rican girl watching TV and not having a lot to identify with. West Side Story was really my favorite thing because it had Puerto Ricans in it\\". Lopez explained that her partnership with nuvoTV marked a natural step in her career. \\"I'm in this business and I do know this business on many different levels ‚Äì in music, in television, in film production, and as an actress, and in so many different ways, even in fashion. It's kind of right up my alley,\\" she said. Lopez was named as chief creative officer of the network on May 16, 2013.https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin-notas/1562336/jennifer- lopez-appointed-chief-creative-officer-of-nuvotv =Fuse Media (2014‚Äì15)= On April 4, 2014, SiTV Media announced that it would acquire cable music channel Fuse for $226 million, in a deal which resulted in its former owner, The Madison Square Garden Company, also acquiring a 15% stake in SiTV. Prior to the official announcement, Benny Medina (Jennifer Lopez's manager and the network's chief creative officer) stated that if SiTV were to acquire Fuse, there were no immediate plans to make any major changes to the network's programming, emphasizing that Fuse and NuvoTV would be \\"two different companies with two different identities, audiences and goals.\\" In 2015, it was announced that NuvoTV would fold into Fuse, as the latter network expands its programming to target an audience dubbed \\"New Young Americans\\". After that, NuvoTV continued to premiere new programming. Nuvo TV merged with Fuse TV on September 30, 2015.https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/fuse-new-original- programs-relativity-media-fluffy-1201554177/ References External links * Category:Defunct television networks in the United States Category:Jennifer Lopez Category:Companies based in Glendale, California Category:Television channels and stations established in 2004 Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2015 Category:2004 establishments in California Category:2015 disestablishments in California Category:Privately held companies based in California Category:Defunct companies based in Greater Los Angeles ","title":"NuvoTV"},{"id":"3627783","text":"Cono de Arita, a natural monument in Argentina.

This neutrality wavered at times and \\"strict neutrality\\" gave way to \\"non-belligerence\\" after the Fall of France in June 1940. Franco wrote to Adolf Hitler offering to join the war on 19 June 1940.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 177. Later the same year Franco met with Hitler in Hendaye to discuss Spain's possible accession to the Axis Powers. The meeting went nowhere, but Franco would help the Axis ‚Äî whose members Italy and Germany had supported him during the Spanish Civil War ‚Äî in various ways. Despite ideological sympathy, Franco even stationed field armies in the Pyrenees to deter Axis occupation of the Iberian Peninsula. The Spanish policy frustrated Axis proposals that would have encouraged Franco to take British-controlled Gibraltar.The History Channel. \\"November 19, 1940: Hitler urges Spain to grab Gibraltar.\\" http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/hitler-urges-spain-to- grab-gibraltar Much of the reason for Spanish reluctance to join the war was due to Spain's reliance on imports from the United States. Spain was still recovering from its civil war and Franco knew his armed forces would not be able to defend the Canary Islands and Spanish Morocco from a British attack.Sager, Murray (July 2009). \\"Franco, Hitler & the play for Gibraltar: how the Spanish held firm on the Rock\\". Esprit de Corps. Archived from the original on 2012-07-08. In 1941 Franco approved the recruitment of volunteers to Germany on the guarantee that they only fight against the Soviet Union and not against the western Allies. This resulted in the formation of the Blue Division which fought as part of the German army on the Eastern Front between 1941 and 1944. Spanish policy would return to \\"strict neutrality\\" as the tide of war started to turn against the Axis. American pressure in 1944 for Spain to stop tungsten exports to Germany and to withdraw the Blue Division led to an oil embargo which forced Franco to yield. After the war, Spain was not allowed to join the newly created United Nations because of the wartime support for the Axis, and Spain would be isolated by many other countries until the mid-1950s. Domestic politics During World War II, Spain was governed by an autocratic government, but despite Franco's own pro-Axis leanings and debt of gratitude to Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler, the government was divided between Germanophiles and Anglophiles. When the war started, Juan Beigbeder Atienza, an Anglophile, was the minister of foreign affairs. The rapid German advance in Europe convinced Franco to replace him with Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er, Franco's brother-in-law and a strong Germanophile (18 October 1940). After the Allied victories in North Africa, Franco changed tack again, appointing Francisco G√≥mez-Jordana Sousa, sympathetic to the British, as minister in September 1942. Another influential Anglophile was the Duke of Alba, Spain's ambassador in London. Diplomacy From the very beginning of World War II, Spain favoured the Axis Powers. Apart from ideology, Spain had a debt to Germany of $212 million for supplies of mat√©riel during the Civil War. Indeed, in June 1940, after the Fall of France, the Spanish Ambassador to Berlin had presented a memorandum in which Franco declared he was \\"ready under certain conditions to enter the war on the side of Germany and Italy\\". Franco had cautiously decided to enter the war on the Axis side in June 1940, and to prepare his people for war, an anti-British and anti-French campaign was launched in the Spanish media that demanded French Morocco, Cameroon and the return of Gibraltar.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 133. On 19 June 1940, Franco pressed along a message to Hitler saying he wanted to enter the war, but Hitler was annoyed at Franco's demand for the French colony of Cameroon, which had been German before World War I, and which Hitler was planning on taking back.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 177. Franco with Karl Wolff, Heinrich Himmler and Serrano- Su√±er in 1940 At first Adolf Hitler did not encourage Franco's offer, as he was convinced of eventual victory. In August 1940, when Hitler became serious about having Spain enter the war, a major problem that emerged was the German demand for air and naval bases in Spanish Morocco and the Canaries, which Franco was completely opposed to.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 pages 176-177. After the victory over France, Hitler had revived Plan Z (shelved in September 1939) for having a huge fleet with the aim of fighting the United States, and he wanted bases in Morocco and the Canary islands for the planned showdown with America.Weinberg, Gerhard A World In Arms, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 178. The American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote: \\"The fact that Germans were willing to forgo Spain's participation in the war rather than abandon their plans for naval bases on and off the coast of Northwest Africa surely demonstrates the centrality of this latter issue to Hitler as he looked forward to naval war with the United States\\". In September, when the Royal Air Force had demonstrated its resilience in defeating the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain, Hitler promised Franco help in return for its active intervention. This had become part of a strategy to forestall Allied intervention in north- west Africa. Hitler promised that \\"Germany would do everything in its power to help Spain\\" and would recognise Spanish claims to French territory in Morocco, in exchange for a share of Moroccan raw materials. Franco responded warmly, but without any firm commitment. Falangist media agitated for irredentism, claiming for Spain the portions of Catalonia and the Basque Country that were still under French administration.Serrano Su√±er, tragedia personal y fascismo pol√≠tico, Javier Tusell, El Pa√≠s, 2 September 2003: \\"Serrano ante √©l [Hitler] lleg√≥ a sugerir que el Rosell√≥n debia ser espa√±ol, por catal√°n, y que Portugal no ten√≠a sentido como unidad pol√≠tica independiente.\\"El √∫ltimo de los de Franco, Santiago P√©rez D√≠az, El Pa√≠s 7 September 2003 Hitler and Franco met only once at Hendaye, France on 23 October 1940 to fix the details of an alliance. By this time, the advantages had become less clear for either side. Franco asked for too much from Hitler. In exchange for entering the war alongside the alliance of Germany and Italy, Franco, among many things, demanded heavy fortification of the Canary Islands as well as large quantities of grain, fuel, armed vehicles, military aircraft and other armaments. In response to Franco's nearly impossible demands, Hitler threatened Franco with a possible annexation of Spanish territory by Vichy France. At the end of the day, no agreement was reached. A few days later in Germany, Hitler would famously tell Mussolini, \\"I prefer to have three or four of my own teeth pulled out than to speak to that man again!\\" It is subject to historical debate whether Franco overplayed his hand by demanding too much from Hitler for Spanish entry into the war, or if he deliberately stymied the German dictator by setting the price for his alliance unrealistically high, knowing that Hitler would refuse his demands and thus save Spain from entering another devastating war. Memorial to the Spanish immigrants to France who fought in the Spanish Civil War, and in the French Resistance. Garden of the Rights of the Child, Saint-Denis Spain relied upon oil supplies from the United States, and the US had agreed to listen to British recommendations on this. As a result, the Spanish were told that supplies would be restricted, albeit with a ten-week reserve. Lacking a strong navy, any Spanish intervention would rely, inevitably, upon German ability to supply oil. Some of Germany's own activity relied upon captured French oil reserves, so additional needs from Spain were unhelpful. From the German point of view, Vichy's active reaction to British and Free French attacks (Destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir and Dakar) had been encouraging, so perhaps Spanish intervention was less vital. Also, in order to keep Vichy \\"on-side\\", the proposed territorial changes in Morocco became a potential embarrassment and were diluted. As a consequence of this, neither side would make sufficient compromises and after nine hours, the talks failed. In December 1940, Hitler contacted Franco again via a letter sent by the German ambassador to Spain and returned to the issue of Gibraltar. Hitler attempted to force Franco's hand with a blunt request for the passage of several divisions of German troops through Spain to attack Gibraltar. Franco refused, citing the danger that the United Kingdom still presented to Spain and the Spanish colonies. In his return letter, Franco told Hitler that he wanted to wait until Britain \\"was on the point of collapse\\". In a second diplomatic letter, Hitler got tougher and offered grain and military supplies to Spain as an inducement. By this time, however, Italian troops were being routed by the British in Cyrenaica and Italian East Africa, and the Royal Navy had displayed its freedom of action in Italian waters. The UK was clearly not finished. Franco responded \\"that the fact has left the circumstances of October far behind\\" and \\"the Protocol then agreed must now be considered outmoded\\". Mauthausen deploy a banner to salute the Allies According to Franco's own autobiography, he also met privately once with Italian leader Benito Mussolini in Bordighera, Italy on 12 February 1941 Quotation of Mussolini, Album di una vita by Mario Cervi at the Bordighera site. Accessed online 18 October 2006. at Hitler's request. Hitler hoped that Mussolini could persuade Franco to enter the war. However, Mussolini was not interested in Franco's help after the series of defeats his forces had recently suffered in North Africa and the Balkans. Franco signed the Anti-Comintern Pact on 25 November 1941. In 1942, the planning of Operation Torch (American landings in North Africa) was considerably influenced by the apprehension that it might precipitate Spain to abandon neutrality and join the Axis, in which case the Straits of Gibraltar might be closed. In order to meet this contingency, it was decided by the Combined Chiefs of Staff to include a landing in Casablanca, in order to have an option of an overland route via Moroccan territory bypassing the Straits. Franco's policy of open support to the Axis Powers led to a period of postwar isolation for Spain as trade with most countries ceased. U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, who had assured Franco that Spain would not suffer consequences from the Allies, died in April 1945. Roosevelt's successor, Harry S. Truman, as well as new Allied governments, were less friendly to Franco. A number of nations withdrew their ambassadors, and Spain was not admitted to the United Nations until 1955. Military Although it sought to avoid entering the war, Spain did make plans for defense of the country. Initially, most of the Spanish Army was stationed in southern Spain in case of an Allied attack from Gibraltar during 1940 and 1941. However, Franco ordered a gradual redeployment to the Pyrenees Mountains along the French border in case of a possible German invasion of Spain as Axis interest in Gibraltar grew. By the time it became clear that the Allies were gaining the upper hand in the conflict, Franco had massed all his troops on the French border and received personal assurances from the leaders of Allied countries that they did not wish to invade Spain. = Spanish Army during the war = At the end of the Civil War in 1939 the Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of the Navy were reorganized, and the Ministry of the Air Force was established. The Captaincies General were reestablished, based on eight Army Corps in the peninsula and two in Morocco. In 1943, the IX Military Region (Granada) and the First Armored Division (August 20, 1943) were created within the General Reserve. Accustomed to a fixed-position war, without major strategic changes, the Spanish Army lacked the operational mobility of the armored units of large European armies, as well as experience in combined tank-infantry operations. The most modern tanks used in the Civil War had been the Russian T-26, the German Panzer I and various Italian tanks Fiat, already out of date by 1940. At the end of the Second World War in 1945, Spain had 300,000 enlisted men, 25,000 non-commissioned officers and 25,000 chiefs and officers in the Army. Their weapons were by now very obsolete, due to the rapid technological evolution that had occurred during the war. =Operation Felix= Invasion plans of Nazi Germany and probable routes of British invasion Before Franco and Hitler's October 1940 meeting in Hendaye, there had been Spanish-German planning for an attack, from Spain, upon the British territory of Gibraltar which was, and is, a British dependency and military base. At the time, Gibraltar was important for control of the western exit from the Mediterranean and the sea routes to the Suez Canal and Middle East, as well as Atlantic patrols. The Germans also appreciated the strategic importance of north-west Africa for bases and as a route for any future American involvement. Therefore, the plans included the occupation of the region by substantial German forces, to forestall any future Allied invasion attempt. The plan, Operation Felix, was in detailed form before the negotiations failed at Hendaye. By March 1941, military resources were being ear-marked for Barbarossa and the Soviet Union. Operation Felix-Heinrich was an amended form of Felix that would be invoked once certain objectives in Russia had been achieved. In the event, these conditions were not fulfilled and Franco still held back from entering the war.Shulman, pp. 66‚Äì67 After the war, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel said: \\"Instead of attacking Russia, we should have strangled the British Empire by closing the Mediterranean. The first step in the operation would have been the conquest of Gibraltar. That was another great opportunity we missed.\\"Shulman, p. 68 If that had succeeded, Hermann G√∂ring proposed that Germany would \\"... offer Britain the right to resume peaceful traffic through the Mediterranean if she came to terms with Germany and joined us in a war against Russia\\". As the war progressed and the tide turned against the Axis, the Germans planned for the event of an Allied attack through Spain. There were three successive plans, progressively less aggressive as German capability waned: =Operation Isabella= This was planned in April 1941 as a reaction to a proposed British landing on the Iberian peninsula near Gibraltar. German troops would advance into Spain to support Franco and expel the British wherever they landed. =Operation Ilona or Gisella= Ilona was a scaled down version of Isabella, subsequently renamed Gisella. Devised in May 1942, to be invoked whether or not Spain stayed neutral. Ten German divisions would advance to Barcelona and, if necessary, towards Salamanca to support the Spanish army in fighting another proposed Allied landing either from the Mediterranean or Atlantic coasts. =Operation Nurnberg= Devised in June 1943, Nurnberg was purely a defensive operation in the Pyrenees along both sides of the Spanish-French border in the event of Allied landings in the Iberian peninsula, which were to repel an Allied advance from Spain into France. A Spanish volunteer of the Blue Division Occupation of Tangier Spanish troops occupied the Tangier International Zone on 14 June 1940, the same day Paris fell to the Germans. Despite calls by the writer Rafael S√°nchez Mazas and other Spanish nationalists to annex Tangier, the Franco regime publicly considered the occupation a temporary wartime measure. A diplomatic dispute between Britain and Spain over the latter's abolition of the city's international institutions in November 1940 led to a further guarantee of British rights and a Spanish promise not to fortify the area. In May 1944, although it had served as a contact point between him and the later Axis Powers during the Spanish Civil War, Franco expelled all German diplomats from the area. The territory was restored to its pre-war status on 11 October 1945. In July 1952 the protecting powers met at Rabat to discuss the Zone's future, agreeing to abolish it. Tangier joined with the rest of Morocco following the restoration of full sovereignty in 1956. Volunteers The main part of Spain's involvement in the war was through volunteers. They fought for both sides, largely reflecting the allegiances of the civil war. Spanish volunteers at an official act =Spanish volunteers in Axis service= Although Spanish caudillo Francisco Franco did not bring Spain into World War II on the side of the Axis, he permitted volunteers to join the German Army on the clear and guaranteed condition they would fight against Bolshevism (Soviet Communism) on the Eastern Front, and not against the western Allies. In this manner, he could keep Spain at peace with the western Allies, while repaying German support during the Spanish Civil War and providing an outlet for the strong anti- Communist sentiments of many Spanish nationalists. Spanish foreign minister Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er suggested raising a volunteer corps, and at the commencement of Operation Barbarossa, Franco sent an official offer of help to Berlin. Hitler approved the use of Spanish volunteers on 24 June 1941. Volunteers flocked to recruiting offices in all the metropolitan areas of Spain. Cadets from the officer training school in Zaragoza volunteered in particularly large numbers. Initially, the Spanish government was prepared to send about 4,000 men, but soon realized that there were more than enough volunteers to fill an entire division: ‚Äì the Blue Division or Divisi√≥n Azul under Agust√≠n Mu√±oz Grandes ‚Äì including an air force squadron ‚Äì the Blue Squadron, 18,104 men in all, with 2,612 officers and 15,492 soldiers. The Blue Division was trained in Germany before serving in the Siege of Leningrad, and notably at the Battle of Krasny Bor, where General Infantes' 6,000 Spanish soldiers threw back some 30,000 Soviet troops. In August 1942, it was transferred north to the southeastern flank of the Siege of Leningrad, just south of the Neva near Pushkin, Kolpino and Krasny Bor in the Izhora River area. After the collapse of the German southern front following the Battle of Stalingrad, more German troops were deployed southwards. By this time, General Emilio Esteban Infantes had taken command. The Blue Division faced a major Soviet attempt to break the siege of Leningrad in February 1943, when the 55th Army of the Soviet forces, reinvigorated after the victory at Stalingrad, attacked the Spanish positions at the Battle of Krasny Bor, near the main Moscow-Leningrad road. Despite very heavy casualties, the Spaniards were able to hold their ground against a Soviet force seven times larger and supported by tanks. The assault was contained and the siege of Leningrad was maintained for a further year. The division remained on the Leningrad front where it continued to suffer heavy casualties due to weather and to enemy action, In October 1943, under severe diplomatic pressure, the Blue Division was ordered home leaving a token force until March 1944. In all, about 45,000 Spanish served on the Eastern Front, mostly committed volunteers, and around 4,500 died. Joseph Stalin's desire to retaliate against Franco by making an Allied invasion of Spain the first order of business at the Potsdam Conference in July 1945, was not supported by Harry S. Truman and Winston Churchill. War weary and unwilling to continue the conflict, Truman and Churchill persuaded Stalin to instead settle for a full trade embargo against Spain. Memorial of the Blue Division at La Almudena Cemetery, Madrid 372 members of the Blue Division, the Blue Legion, or volunteers of the Spanische-Freiwilligen Kompanie der SS 101 were taken prisoner by the victorious Red Army; 286 of these men were kept in captivity until 2 April 1954, when they returned to Spain aboard the ship Semiramis, supplied by the International Red Cross.. =Spanish volunteers in Allied service= An M8 Greyhound armored car of the US Army's 11th Armored Division entering the Mauthausen concentration camp. The banner in the background (in Spanish) reads as \\"Anti-fascist Spaniards salute the forces of liberation\\". After their defeat in the Spanish Civil War, numbers of Republican veterans and civilians went into exile in France; the French Republic interned them in refugee camps, such as Camp Gurs in southern France. To improve their conditions, many joined the French Foreign Legion at the start of World War II, making up a sizeable proportion of it. Around sixty thousand joined the French Resistance, mostly as guerrillas, with some also continuing the fight against Francisco Franco.Crowdy, Terry (2007). French Resistance Fighter: France's Secret Army. Oxford: Osprey Publishing. p. 13 Several thousand more joined the Free French Forces and fought against the Axis Powers. Some sources have claimed that as many as 2,000 served in General Leclerc's Second French Division, many of them from the former Durruti Column. The number of Spaniards that served in the Second French Armoured Division in World War II remains disputed. The official French ' claimed there were less than 300 Spaniards. The 9th Armoured Company comprised almost entirely battle-hardened Spanish veterans; it became the first Allied military unit to enter Paris upon its liberation in August, 1944, where it met up with a large number of Spanish Maquis fighting alongside French resistance fighters. Furthermore, 1,000 Spanish Republicans served in the 13th Half-brigade of the French Foreign Legion.Beevor, Antony. (2006). The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War, 1936‚Äì1939. Penguin Books. London. p. 419 In Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union received former Communist Spanish leaders and child evacuees from Republican families. When Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, many, such as communist General Enrique L√≠ster, joined the Red Army. According to Beevor, 700 Spanish Republicans served in the Red Army and another 700 operated as partisans behind the German lines. Individual Spaniards, such as the double-agent Juan Pujol Garc√≠a (code name GARBO), also worked for the Allied cause. Bribes by MI6 According to a 2008 book, Winston Churchill authorised millions of dollars in bribes to Spanish generals in an effort to influence General Franco against entering the war on the side of Germany. In May 2013 files were released showing MI6 spent the present-day equivalent of more than $200 million bribing senior Spanish military officers, ship owners and other agents to keep Spain out of the war.https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/may/23/mi6-spain-200m-bribes-ww2 Resources and trade Despite lacking cash, oil and other supplies, Francoist Spain was able to supply some essential materials to Germany. There was a series of secret war-time trade agreements between the two countries. The principal resource was wolfram (or tungsten) ore from German-owned mines in Spain. Tungsten was essential to Germany for its advanced precision engineering and therefore for armament production. Despite Allied attempts to buy all available supplies, which rocketed in price, and diplomatic efforts to influence Spain, supplies to Germany continued until August 1944. Payment for wolfram was effectively set against the Spanish debt to Germany. Other minerals included iron ore, zinc, lead and mercury. Spain also acted as a conduit for goods from South America, for example, industrial diamonds and platinum. After the war, evidence was found of significant gold transactions between Germany and Spain, ceasing only in May 1945. It was believed that these were derived from Nazi looting of occupied lands, but attempts by the Allies to obtain control of the gold and return it were largely frustrated. Espionage and sabotage station of Canfranc As long as Spain permitted it, the Abwehr ‚Äì the German intelligence organisation ‚Äì was able to operate in Spain and Spanish Morocco, often with cooperation of the Nationalist government. Gibraltar's installations were a prime target for sabotage, using sympathetic anti-British Spanish workers. One such attack occurred in June 1943, when a bomb caused a fire and explosions in the dockyard. The British were generally more successful after this and managed to use turned agents and sympathetic anti-Fascist Spaniards to uncover subsequent attacks. A total of 43 sabotage attempts were prevented in this way. By January 1944, a Gibraltarian and two Spanish workers, convicted of attempted sabotage, had been executed. The Abwehr also financed, trained and equipped saboteurs to attack British naval assets. The Germans contacted a Spanish staff officer from Campo de Gibraltar, Lieutenant Colonel Eleuterio S√°nchez Rubio, a Spanish army officer, member of the Falange and coordinator of the intelligence operations in the Campo, to establish a network of saboteurs with access to Gibraltar. S√°nchez Rubio designated Emilio Plazas Tejera, also a member of Falange, as operations chief of the organisation.Ros Agudo (2005), pp. 232‚Äì234 The Spanish agents sank the armed trawler , and destroyed the auxiliary minesweeper , which resulted in the deaths of six British seamen on 18 January 1942.Royal Navy casualties, January 1942Naval Events, January 1942, Part 2HMS Erin ASW Trawler Uboat.net Plazas was assisted by the Spanish naval commander of Puente Mayorga, Manuel Romero Hume, who allowed him to beach a rowboat there. The Abwehr also maintained observation posts along both sides of the Straits of Gibraltar, reporting on shipping movements. A German agent in C√°diz was the target of a successful Allied disinformation operation, Operation Mincemeat, prior to the invasion of Sicily in 1943. In early 1944, the situation changed. The Allies were clearly gaining the advantage over the Axis and one double agent had provided enough information for Britain to make a detailed protest to the Spanish government. As a result, the Spanish government declared its \\"strict neutrality\\". The Abwehr operation in southern Spain was consequently closed down. The rail station of Canfranc was the conduit for the smuggling of people and information from Vichy France to the British consulate in San Sebasti√°n. The nearer border station of Ir√∫n could not be used as it bordered occupied France. Jews and other refugees In the first years of the war, \\"Laws regulating their admittance were written and mostly ignored.\\"Alexy, p. 77. They were mainly from Western Europe, fleeing deportation to concentration camps from occupied France, but also Jews from Eastern Europe, especially Hungary. Trudi Alexy refers to the \\"absurdity\\" and \\"paradox of refugees fleeing the Nazis' Final Solution to seek asylum in a country where no Jews had been allowed to live openly as Jews for over four centuries.\\"Trudi Alexy, The Mezuzah in the Madonna's Foot, Simon and Schuster, 1993. . p. 74. Throughout World War II, Spanish diplomats of the Franco government extended their protection to Eastern European Jews, especially in Hungary. Jews claiming Spanish ancestry were provided with Spanish documentation without being required to prove their case and either left for Spain or survived the war with the help of their new legal status in occupied countries. Once the tide of war began to turn, and Count Francisco G√≥mez- Jordana Sousa succeeded Franco's brother-in-law Serrano S√∫√±er as Spain's foreign minister, Spanish diplomacy became \\"more sympathetic to Jews\\", although Franco himself \\"never said anything\\" about this. Around that same time, a contingent of Spanish doctors travelling in Poland were fully informed of the Nazi extermination plans by Governor-General Hans Frank, who was under the misimpression that they would share his views about the matter; when they came home, they passed the story to Admiral Lu√≠s Carrero Blanco, who told Franco.Alexy, p. 164‚Äì165. Diplomats discussed the possibility of Spain as a route to a containment camp for Jewish refugees near Casablanca, but it came to naught without Free French and British support.Alexy, p. 77‚Äì78. Nonetheless, control of the Spanish border with France relaxed somewhat at this time,Alexy, p. 165. and thousands of Jews managed to cross into Spain (many by smugglers' routes). Almost all of them survived the war.Alexy, p. 79, passim. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee operated openly in Barcelona.Alexy, p. 154‚Äì155, passim. Shortly afterwards, Spain began giving citizenship to Sephardic Jews in Greece, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania; many Ashkenazic Jews also managed to be included, as did some non-Jews. The Spanish head of mission in Budapest, √Ångel Sanz Briz, saved thousands of Ashkenazim in Hungary by granting them Spanish citizenship, placing them in safe houses and teaching them minimal Spanish so they could pretend to be Sephardim, at least to someone who did not know Spanish. The Spanish diplomatic corps was performing a balancing act: Alexy conjectures that the number of Jews they took in was limited by how much German hostility they were willing to engender.Alexy, p. 165 et. seq. Toward the war's end, Sanz Briz had to flee Budapest, leaving these Jews open to arrest and deportation. An Italian diplomat, Giorgio Perlasca, who was himself living under Spanish protection, used forged documents to persuade the Hungarian authorities that he was the new Spanish Ambassador. As such, he continued Spanish protection of Hungarian Jews until the Red Army arrived. Although Spain effectively undertook more to help Jews escape deportation to the concentration camps than most neutral countries did, there has been debate about Spain's wartime attitude towards refugees. Franco's regime, despite its aversion to Zionism and \\"Judeo\\"-Freemasonry, does not appear to have shared the rabid anti-Semitic ideology promoted by the Nazis. About 25,000 to 35,000 refugees, mainly Jews, were allowed to transit through Spain to Portugal and beyond. Some historians argue that these facts demonstrate a humane attitude by Franco's regime, while others point out that the regime only permitted Jewish transit through Spain. After the war, Franco's regime was quite hospitable to those who had been responsible for the deportation of the Jews, notably Louis Darquier de Pellepoix, Commissioner for Jewish Affairs (May 1942 ‚Äì February 1944) under the Vichy R√©gime in France, and to many other former Nazis, such as Otto Skorzeny and L√©on Degrelle, and other former Fascists.Nicholas Fraser, \\"Toujours Vichy: a reckoning with disgrace\\", Harper's, October 2006, p. 86‚Äì94. The relevant statement about Spain sheltering him is on page 91. Jos√© Mar√≠a Finat y Escriv√° de Roman√≠, Franco's chief of security, issued an official order dated 13 May 1941 to all provincial governors requesting a list of all Jews, both local and foreign, present in their districts. After the list of six thousand names was compiled, Roman√≠ was appointed Spain's ambassador to Germany, enabling him to deliver it personally to Himmler. Following the defeat of Germany in 1945, the Spanish government attempted to destroy all evidence of cooperation with the Nazis, but this official order survived.Haaretz, 22 June 2010, \\"WWII Document Reveals: General Franco Handed Nazis List of Spanish Jews,\\" http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/wwii- document-reveals-general-franco-handed-nazis-list-of-spanish-jews-1.297546 , citing a report published 20 June 2010 in the Spanish daily El Pais. Japanese war reparations At the end of the war, Japan was compelled to pay high amounts of money or goods to several nations to cover damage or injury inflicted during the war. In the case of Spain, the reparations were due to the deaths of over a hundred Spanish citizens, including several Catholic missionaries, and great destruction of Spanish properties in the Philippines during the Japanese occupation. To that effect, in 1954 Japan concluded 54 bilateral agreements including one with Spain for $5.5 million, paid in 1957.

Background Leave it to Chance is set in a world where supernatural elements are fairly commonplace, and the existence of monsters, ghosts, demons, magicians and other similar beings is general knowledge ‚Äì for example, mobsters routinely use magic to transform their men into powerful \\"troggs\\", and the city the series is set in, Devil's Echo, has a community of goblins inhabiting its sewers. Members of the Falconer family have a legacy of battling supernatural threats, and traditionally training for the cause is begun at the age of 14. However, Chance is not given that opportunity by her father, who refuses to train her. He insists that the tradition is not to pass the knowledge \\"from father to child\\", but \\"from father to son\\" and points out that the job is too dangerous for her. This decision appears not to be motivated by a patronizing attitude or misogyny, but rather by the fact that he has already lost his wife to supernatural forces in an incident where his own face was deformed, and doesn't want Chance to suffer the same fate. Instead, he suggests that the tradition should skip a generation, and Chance should meet a man, get married and have a son, whom Lucas may then train instead. But Chance isn't willing to accept that decision, and although Lucas frowns on his daughter's escapades and repeated attempts to investigate crimes and incidents that involve the supernatural, Chance is set on following the family trade on her own. Later in the series, it is implied that Lucas is secretly pleased by his daughter's courage and skill, even though he prefers to present the image of a strict but caring disciplinarian. Supporting cast Chance's father Lucas Falconer is a constant presence, who is also employing butler Hobbs and a housekeeper Quince, while Dash the faerie lives in the garden. More attention settled on Will Bendix is a sly yet effective newspaper reporter vying for attention of Margo Vela, a police officer unlucky with men. Lt. Ben Saunders and mayor Calloway represent local authorities. Chance's friends are Zoe, Emily, Kay and Ruby. The city, with its mix of communities and architecture is more fleshed out to be more than just a setting. Storylines The series started with a four-part storyline, collected in the Shaman's Rain trade paperback, introducing the characters and premise, along with the city of Devil's Echo. Preparing to leave her childhood and unfortunately distance from her faerie friend Dash, Chance Falconer investigates the attack on a shaman that came to the city with his daughter in the midst of political back-stabbing preceding the elections. Her father absent, Chance still decides to get tangled up in unraveling the plot to destroy the city. Making allies in the police department and the newspapers, she ultimately reveals an antagonist from her father's most disturbing case using the political unrest to fuel greater troubles to the city. The next several issues spotlighted Chance's short adventures, collected in Trick or Threat and Other Stories. The title story took place during the Halloween parade, when Chance with the help of her father's friend Jean Pierre tracks Stanley, monkey stolen from a child called Greg to be used as part of an occult ritual bent on gathering power for a faction of antagonists. Other stories included a 2-part story centering on Chance being sent in the school for girls built upon what is said to be pirate Captain Hitch's lair, where she investigates the strange happenings connected to the rumors of the Captain's ghost roaming the halls. \\"The Phantom of the Mall\\" had Chance and her newfound school friends back at Devil's Echo being drawn in a mystery of a masked figure taking revenge on the mall he had previous ties with. The short stories seemed designed to introduce several antagonists who would eventually cross paths with Chance again The Monster Madness trade paperback consists mainly of a two-part story where a cinema-owner's scheme goes awry, and with the help of a magician the horror icons not only escape the movie they appear in but bring trouble to Devil's Echo. The horror icons are stand ins for movie monsters: Count represents Dracula, Pharaoh ‚Äì the Mummy, Howler ‚Äì the Wolf man (who infected Margo's partner Roger Howard) and the Man Monster ‚Äì Monster of Frankenstein. The arc is singular in that it was open-ended, with larger power behind the scenes and his magician unseen ‚Äì Chance seemed attracted by one of his helpers called Lightfoot who was part of the plan to use the monster's rampage as a diversion for looting. A short story appeared next, with the Falconer household attending a hockey game finale in which a player goes missing and another returns from recent death thanks to shady agendas surrounding the game. Two more issues were published but not yet collected, the first one of which showing Chance getting back to her promise made in #1 that she will see faerie Dash in her garden again. Using the potion Lewis Carroll gave to her father, she shrinks and visits the garden, helping Dash fight another, more brutal species of faeries that left Devil's Echo due to bad magic. That storyline foreshadowed events to come in the series. Several years later, the double-sized last issue (to date) has been published revolving around the storyline of Lucas Falconer's murder. It featured a large cast of characters, with Jean Pierre, Margo, Roger and Bendix helping Chance investigate psychic Milo Otway impersonator's causing a plague of zombies that distracts the city while Lightfoot and captain Hitch do his business with possibly Lucas Falconer following them, having faked his death before. The story ended with Chance recognized by the city as its new protector and ready to unveil the larger plot. Awards The series won several awards in 1997: The Harvey Award for Best New Series, and the Eisner Awards for Best New Series and Best Title for Younger Readers. A collection of issues #1‚Äì4, named Leave it to Chance: Shaman's Rain was a top vote-getter for the Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Award for Favorite Reprint Graphic Album for 1998.

It is located in Prabhadevi, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. It was originally built by Laxman Vithu and Deubai Patil on 19 November 1801. It is one of the richest temples in India.The Birth of Shree Siddhivinayak Ganapati The temple has a small mandap with the shrine for Siddhi Vinayak (\\"Ganesha who grants your wish\\"). The wooden doors to the sanctum are carved with images of the Ashtavinayak (the eight manifestations of Ganesha in Maharashtra). The inner roof of the sanctum is plated with gold, and the central statue is of Ganesha. In the periphery, there is a Hanuman temple as well. The exterior of the temple consists of a dome which is lit up with multiple colors in the evenings and they keep changing every few hours. The statue of Shri Ganesha is located exactly under the dome.  Importance and status  The Siddhivinayak Mandir evolved from a small, tiny place of worship to the Grand Temple that stands today in the later half of the twentieth century. Temple glory was bought not only by the politicians who frequented the temple but also Bollywood film stars who continuously visit to seek the blessings of Lord Ganesha. Tim Cook, Apple's CEO began his 2016 India trip with morning prayers at the temple. Siddhivinayak is well known as \\"Navsacha Ganapati\\" or \\"Navasala Pavanara Ganapati\\" ('Ganapati bestows whenever humbly genuinely prayed a wish') among devotees. Facilities for performing different kind of puja are made available by the temple authorities. History It was constructed on 19 November 1801. The original structure of the Siddhivinayak Temple was a small 3.6 metre x 3.6 metre square brick structure with a dome-shaped brick shikhara. The temple was built by the contractor Laxman Vithu Patil. The building was funded by a rich Agri woman named Deubai Patil. Childless due to infertility, Deaubai built the temple so that Ganesha should grant children to other infertile women. Ramakrishna Jambhekar Maharaj, a disciple of the Hindu saint Akkalkot Swami Samarth, buried two divine idols in the front of the presiding deity of the temple on the orders of his guru. It is claimed that after 21 years of the burial of the icons, a mandar tree grew at that spot with a svayambhu Ganesha in its branches - as prophesied by Swami Samartha. The 2550 temple complex had two 3.6 metre Deepamalas, a rest house and living quarters for the caretaker. It had an adjoining lake, 30 x 40 square metres in size on the eastern and southern side of the temple. The lake, dug by Nardulla in the early 19th century to counter the scarcity of water, was filled up in the later years and the land is now not part of the temple complex. Around 1952, a small Hanuman shrine was built in the temple complex for the Hanuman icon that was found during the road extension project of Sayani Road near Elphinstone Road. In the 1950s and 60s, the fame of the temple spread and a significant number of devotees began visiting. However, in the same period, the owner of the plot sold some of the temple land, reducing the complex area. After 1975, the number of devotees increased dramatically.History  Controversy  The Siddhivinayak temple receives donations of around ‚Äì every year, which makes it Mumbai city's richest temple trust.Siddhivinayak grants may be screened, Times of India, 10th December 2004.

The earliest inhabitants of North America entered Montana east of the Continental Divide between the Cordilleran and Laurentide ice sheets.Strohmaier, David Jon. Drift Smoke: Loss and Renewal in a Land of Fire. Las Vegas, Nev.: University of Nevada Press, 2005. The area remained only sparsely inhabited, however.Malone, Michael P.; Roeder, Richard B.; and Lang, William L. Montana: A History of Two Centuries. 2d rev. ed. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2003. Salish Indians would often hunt bison in the area on a seasonal basis, but no permanent settlements existed near the Great Falls for much of prehistory. Around 1600, Piegan Blackfoot Indians, migrating west, entered the area, pushing the Salish back into the Rocky Mountains and claiming the area as their own. The Great Falls of the Missouri remained in the tribal territory of the Blackfeet until Americans claimed the region in 1803.Fleming, Thomas J. The Louisiana Purchase. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley and Sons, 2003. Although the discovery of the Great Falls by Native Americans is not recorded, the South Piegan Blackfeet were well-acquainted with the Great Falls by the late 18th century, and news of the cataracts had spread among native peoples as far east as central North Dakota. =Lewis and Clark= Meriwether Lewis The United States purchased the area around the Great Falls of the Missouri from France (which claimed the area despite Native American habitation) in 1803, as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Thomas Jefferson, then President of the United States, had long desired to send an expedition into the area.Ambrose, Stephen. Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the Opening of the American West. New York: Simon & Schuster, 1996. ; Gilman, Carolyn. Lewis and Clark: Across the Divide. Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Books, 2003. ; Lavender, David. The Way to the Western Sea: Lewis and Clark Across the Continent. New York: Harpercollins, 1988. Jefferson sought and won permission and funding for an expedition from Congress in January 1803. On May 14, 1804, the Lewis and Clark Expedition departed St. Louis, Missouri to map the course of the Missouri River; establish whether a river route to the Pacific Ocean existed; study the Indian tribes, botany, geology, terrain and wildlife in the region; and evaluate whether British and French Canadian hunters and trappers in the area posed a challenge to American control over the region. Expedition leaders Meriwether Lewis and William Clark first learned of the \\"great falls\\" from the Mandan Indians while wintering at Fort Mandan from November 2, 1804, until April 7, 1805. The Lewis and Clark Expedition reached the Great Falls on June 13, 1805. Meriwether Lewis was the first White person to see the falls. Lewis described the encounter in a now-famous passage of his expedition diary:Spelling and grammar are as Meriwether Lewis made them, and remain uncorrected here. :...my ears were saluted with the agreeable sound of a fall of water and advancing a little further I saw the spray arrise above the plain like a column of smoke which would frequently dispear again in an instant caused I presume by the wind which blew pretty hard from the S. W. I did not however loose my direction to this point which soon began to make a roaring too tremendious to be mistaken for any cause short of the great falls of the Missouri. ... I hurryed down the hill which was about 200 feet high and difficult of access, to gaze on this sublimely grand specticle. ... immediately at the cascade the river is about 300 yds. wide; about ninety or a hundred yards of this next the Lard. bluff is a smooth even sheet of water falling over a precipice of at least eighty feet, the remaining part of about 200 yards on my right formes the grandest sight I ever beheld, the height of the fall is the same of the other but the irregular and somewhat projecting rocks below receives the water in its passage down and brakes it into a perfect white foam which assumes a thousand forms in a moment sometimes flying up in jets of sparkling foam to the height of fifteen or twenty feet and are scarcely formed before large roling bodies of the same beaten and foaming water is thrown over and conceals them. in short the rocks seem to be most happily fixed to present a sheet of the whitest beaten froath for 200 yards in length and about 80 feet perpendicular. the water after descending strikes against the butment before mentioned or that on which I stand and seems to reverberate and being met by the more impetuous courant they role and swell into half formed billows of great height which rise and again disappear in an instant. this butment of rock defends a handsom little bottom of about three acres which is diversified and agreeably shaded with some cottonwood trees; in the lower extremity of the bottom there is a very thick grove of the same kind of trees which are small, in this wood there are several Indian lodges formed of sticks. ... from the reflection of the sun on the spray or mist which arrises from these falls there is a beatifull rainbow produced which adds not a little to the beauty of this majestically grand senery. after wrighting this imperfect discription I again viewed the falls and was so much disgusted with the imperfect idea which it conveyed of the scene that I determined to draw my pen across it and begin agin, but then reflected that I could not perhaps succeed better than pening the first impressions of the mind; I wished for the pencil of Salvator Rosa or the pen of Thompson, that I might be enabled to give to the enlightened world some just idea of this truly magnificent and sublimely grand object, which has from the commencement of time been concealed from the view of civilized man; but this was fruitless and vain. I most sincerely regretted that I had not brought a crimee obscura with me by the assistance of which even I could have hoped to have done better but alas this was also out of my reach; I therefore with the assistance of my pen only indeavoured to traces some of the stronger features of this seen by the assistance of which and my recollection aided by some able pencil I hope still to give to the world some faint idea of an object which at this moment fills me with such pleasure and astonishment, and which of its kind I will venture to ascert is second to but one in the known world. ...Lewis, Meriwether, and Clark, William.

The Lewis and Clark Journals: An American Epic of Discovery: The Abridgment of the Definitive Nebraska Edition. Abridged ed. Gary E. Moulton, ed. Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 2003. Exploring the following day, Lewis discovered Crooked Falls, Rainbow Falls, Colter Falls, and Black Eagle Falls. At the final waterfalls, Lewis saw an amazing sight: :I arrived at another cataract of 26 feet. ... below this fall at a little distance a beatifull little Island well timbered is situated about the middle of the river. in this Island on a Cottonwood tree an Eagle has placed her nest; a more inaccessible spot I believe she could not have found; for neither man nor beast dare pass those gulphs which separate her little domain from the shores. the water is also broken in such manner as it descends over this pitch that the mist or sprey rises to a considerable height. this fall is certainly much the greatest I ever behald except those two which I have mentioned below. it is incomparably a greater cataract and a more noble interesting object than the celibrated falls of Potomac or Soolkiln &c.;Lewis, Meriwether, and Clark, William. The Journals of Lewis and Clark. Whitefish, Mont.: Kessinger Publishing, 2004. pp. 134‚Äì135. Punctuation and spelling as given here. See Google Books preview. Mounting a hill near Black Eagle Falls (probably where the town of Black Eagle is today), Lewis saw that the cataracts ended and that another large river joined the Missouri about two and a half miles further upstream. Although it was very late in the afternoon, Lewis rushed forward to see this river and was attacked by a grizzly bear. He ran more than 80 yards and launched himself into the Missouri River, and luckily the bear did not follow. The Lewis and Clark Expedition was forced to portage around the Great Falls, an arduous task that took nearly a month. York, an African American slave owned by William Clark and who had participated in the Expedition, was the first black American to see the Great Falls.Betts, Robert B.

On June 18, while reconnoitering the series of falls on the south side of the Missouri River with a group of five others, William Clark discovered Giant Springs, which he correctly judged to be the largest spring in the world.Schullery, Paul. Lewis and Clark Among the Grizzlies: Legend and Legacy in the American West. Guilford, Conn.: Globe Pequot, 2002. He was the first white person to see the springs, and the first white person to see the falls from the south side of the Missouri. Meriwether Lewis revisited the Great Falls on July 11, 1806, as the Corps of Discovery returned east. Lewis and nine men stopped at the Great Falls with the intention of exploring the Marias River and discovering its source. But during the night, Indians stole half the party's 17 horses, forcing three of the men to stay behind.Saindon, Robert A. Explorations Into the World of Lewis and Clark. Vol. 3.

In 1860, the Mullan Road linked Fort Benton with Fort Walla Walla in the Washington Territory.Lavender, David Sievert, and Smith, Duane A. The Rockies. Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 2003. Politically, the Great Falls of the Missouri River passed through numerous hands in the 19th century. It was part of the unincorporated frontier until May 30, 1854, when Congress established the Nebraska Territory.Luebke, Frederick C. Nebraska: An Illustrated History. 2d ed. Lincoln, Neb.: University of Nebraska Press, 2005. Indian attacks on white explorers and settlers dropped significantly after Isaac Stevens negotiated the Treaty of Hellgate in 1855, and white settlement in the area began to occur. On March 2, 1861, it became part of the Dakota Territory.Lamar, Howard Roberts. Dakota Territory, 1861‚Äì1889: A Study of Frontier Politics. New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1956; History of Southeastern Dakota. Sioux City, Iowa: Western Publishing Company, 1881.

Conkey Co., 1918. and then into the Montana Territory on May 28, 1864. It became part of the state of Montana upon that territory's admission to statehood on November 8, 1889. The Great Falls of the Missouri River became the site of a permanent settlement in 1883. Businessman Paris Gibson visited the Great Falls in 1880, and was deeply impressed by the possibilities for building a major industrial city near the falls with power provided by hydroelectricity.Roeder, Richard B. \\"Paris Gibson and the Building of Great Falls.\\" Montana: Magazine of Western History. 42:4 (Autumn 1992).\\"Great Falls, Montana.\\" In Encyclopedia of the Great Plains.

He returned in 1883 with surveyors and platted a city (to be named Great Falls) on the south side of the river. The city's first citizen, Silas Beachley, arrived later that year. With investments from railroad owner James J. Hill and Helena businessman C. A. Broadwater, houses, a store, and a flour mill were established in 1884.Malone, Michael P. James J. Hill: Empire Builder of the Northwest. Reprint ed. Stillwater, Okla.: University of Oklahoma Press, 1996. A planing mill, lumber yard, bank, school, and newspaper were established in 1885. By 1887 the town had 1,200 citizens, and in October of that year the Great Northern Railway arrived in the city. Great Falls, Montana, was incorporated on November 28, 1888, Black Eagle Dam was built in 1890, and by 1912 Rainbow Dam and Volta Dam (now Ryan Dam) were all operating. The city of Great Falls, Montana, derives its name from the waterfalls.McCoy, Michael. Montana Off the Beaten Path. 7th ed. Guilford, Conn.: Globe Pequot, 2007. The small town of Black Eagle, Montana, derives its name from Black Eagle Falls, and Cascade County (in which both are located) is named for the cataracts and rapids which make up the falls.The Montana Almanac. Bozeman, Mont.: Montana State University, 1958. =Dams= Rainbow Falls and dam in 2000. Only one of the waterfalls that comprise the Great Falls of the Missouri River, Crooked Falls, exists in its natural state today. Dams built on the falls beginning in the 1880s have significantly altered and even submerged the five waterfalls. Black Eagle Dam was built in 1890, and half of Black Eagle Falls are now submerged in the reservoir behind the dam. This structure was the first hydroelectric dam built in the state.Hebgen, Max. \\"Hydroelectric Development in Montana.\\" Transactions of the American Institute of Mining Engineers. 1914. Rainbow Falls was dammed in 1910 when Rainbow Dam was built. The reservoir behind the dam submerged Colter Falls. Volta Dam was built on top of the Great Falls in 1915, and later renamed Ryan Dam in 1940 in honor of John D. Ryan, the president and founder of the Montana Power Company.National Park Service.

Historic district and interpretive centers The Great Falls Portage, a National Historic Landmark District designated in 1966, commemorates the route by which Lewis and Clark bypassed the falls. The landmarked areas, including the expedition camps at either end of the portage, are located well above and below the series falls. and The Great Falls are also part of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail, established by Congress in 1978.Fanselow, Julie. Traveling the Lewis and Clark Trail. 4th ed. Guilford, Conn.: Globe Pequot, 2007. The Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail Interpretive Center was built in 1998 on a cliff overlooking the Missouri River near Crooked Falls. It provides an extensive look into Lewis and Clark's discovery of the Great Falls and their portage around them, as well as exhibits on native peoples of the area.Halliday, Jan, and Chehak, Gail.

Bloomington, Ind.: iUniverse, 2003. In 1989, the City of Great Falls, the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and other public and private bodies established the River's Edge Trail, a series of paved and unpaved trails that follow the Great Falls as well as the Lewis and Clark Expedition portage route (along with other scenic and historic area of the City of Great Falls and town of Black Eagle).Florence, Mason; Gierlich, Marisa; and Nystrom, Andrew Dean. Rocky Mountains. 3d ed. Oakland, Calif.: Lonely Planet, 2001. In art The first known drawing of the Great Falls was entered by Meriwether Lewis in his diary. In 1807, Lewis commissioned the Irish engraver John James Barrelet to make drawings of the Great Falls. After Lewis's death in 1810, William Clark visited his home and found the drawings, but they have since disappeared. The Great Falls have been depicted in well-known paintings over the years. The waterfalls may be seen in the background of John Mix Stanley's large painting \\"Barter for a Bride\\" (originally titled \\"A Family Group\\"), which was painted some time between 1854 and 1863 and now hangs in the Diplomatic Reception Room in the United States Department of State in Washington, D.C.United States Department of State.

In 1316 bishops from the french Strasbourg started reign about the Rench-valley. After the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss in 1803, Oppenau became part of Baden. In 1990, German politician Wolfgang Sch√§uble suffered an assassination attempt in Oppenau.

Its territory is known now as Cape Breton Island (part of the Canadian province of Nova Scotia) and Prince Edward Island. History The Treaty of Utrecht (1713), which brought an end to the War of the Spanish Succession, broke the equilibrium that existed in North America between Great Britain and France. This treaty marked the start of the reduction of French royal authority in this region of the world. France recognized the rights of Great Britain on the Hudson Bay region and also ceded continental Acadia, Newfoundland and Saint Pierre and Miquelon.R.R. Palmer, A History of the Modern World 2nd ed. 1961, p. 234. The territory of modern New Brunswick was a source of contention between Great Britain and France for 50 years, which was only to be resolved by the Treaty of Paris in 1763 with the abject surrender of the French. Article 13 of the Treaty of Utrecht reads: \\"The Island called Cape Breton and all the others located in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, will as of this date belong to France...\\". In Newfoundland, the French kept their rights of fishing and the use of part of the land along the coast to work. Philippe de Pastour de Costebelle, the French governor of Newfoundland since 1706, became the first governor of √éle-Royale, the French colony established on Cape Breton Island, and served until 1707. He persuaded the inhabitants of Plaisance in 1714 and those of Saint Pierre and Miquelon to come live on the island. The Acadians refused to swear allegiance to the British crown, and some fled to √éle-Royale instead. In 1714, they came to inspect the land and certain families, such as the Costes and the Tillards, decided to establish themselves while others only passed through before settling on √éle Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island.M. Philippe de Pastour de Costebelle The majority established themselves at Saint-Pierre (renamed Port Toulouse) and situated on the eastern coast of √éle-Royale, recreating the Acadian colony. French ships came regularly to fish cod. Partisan map of Acadia in 1754. Louisbourg was founded in 1713, as fishing port for cod and a readily defensible harbour after the Treaty of Utrecht had evicted the French from what is now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Louisbourg lived peacefully for three decades as seaport for the French colony. A fortress was constructed starting in 1719 to protect French interests in the new world, and to serve the seasonal fishing industry. Its geographic position permitted Louisbourg to serve not only as capital of √éle-Royale, but as first line of defence in the 18th century during the wars with Great Britain for the supremacy of North America. The troops of New England aided by the British Royal Marines captured the city in 1745 after six weeks of siege. After three years of British governance, Louisbourg was returned to France in the Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle. The Minister of Marine appointed Charles des Herbiers de La Rali√®re as governor in 1748, and Jean-Louis de Raymond in 1751,DCB: \\"RAYMOND, JEAN- LOUIS DE, Comte de RAYMOND\\" who was replaced in 1754 by Augustin de Boschenry de Drucour. Peace was short lived, and on 26 July 1758, after the Siege of Louisbourg, the French Governor Augustin de Drucourt gave the keys of the city to the British and Edward Boscawen after one of the greatest assaults‚Äîled by James Wolfe‚Äîin the history of colonial Canada. After that, 4,000 Acadian inhabitants were deported. However, a group of ten families from Port-Toulouse fled to Isle Madame where their descendants still live today.

This hotline was established in 1963 and links the Pentagon with the Kremlin (historically, with Soviet Communist Party leadership across the square from the Kremlin itself). Although in popular culture it is known as the \\"red telephone\\", the hotline was never a telephone line, and no red phones were used. The first implementation used Teletype equipment, and shifted to fax machines in 1986. Since 2008, the Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline has been a secure computer link over which messages are exchanged by a secure form of email. Origins =Background= Several people came up with the idea for a hotline. They included Harvard professor Thomas Schelling, who had worked on nuclear war policy for the Defense Department previously. Schelling credited the pop fiction novel Red Alert (the basis of the film Dr. Strangelove) with making governments more aware of the benefit of direct communication between the superpowers. In addition, Parade magazine editor Jess Gorkin personally badgered 1960 presidential candidates John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, and buttonholed the Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev during a U.S. visit to adopt the idea. During this period Gerard C. Smith, as head of the State Department Policy Planning Staff, proposed direct communication links between Moscow and Washington. Objections from others in the State Department, the U.S. military, and the Kremlin delayed introduction. The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis made the hotline a priority. During the standoff, official diplomatic messages typically took six hours to deliver; unofficial channels, such as via television network correspondents, had to be used too as they were quicker. During the crisis, the United States took nearly twelve hours to receive and decode Nikita Khrushchev's 3,000-word initial settlement message - a dangerously long time. By the time Washington had drafted a reply, a tougher message from Moscow had been received, demanding that U.S. missiles be removed from Turkey. White House advisers thought faster communications could have averted the crisis, and resolved it quicker. The two countries signed the Hot Line Agreement in June 1963 - the first time they formally took action to cut the risk of starting a nuclear war unintentionally.Encyclopedia of Russian History =Agreement= The \\"hotline\\", as it would come to be known, was established after the signing of a \\"Memorandum of Understanding Regarding the Establishment of a Direct Communications Line\\" on June 20, 1963, in Geneva, Switzerland, by representatives of the Soviet Union and the United States. =Technical details: United States= At the Pentagon, the hotline system is located at the National Military Command Center. Each MOLINK (Moscow Link) team historically worked an eight-hour shift: a non-commissioned officer looked after the equipment, and a commissioned officer who was fluent in Russian and well-briefed on world affairs was translator. Messages received in Washington automatically carry the U.S. government's highest security classification, \\"Eyes Only - The President\\". The hotline was tested hourly. U.S. test messages have included excerpts of William Shakespeare, Mark Twain, encyclopedias, and a first-aid manual; Soviet tests included passages from the works of Anton Chekhov. MOLINK staffers take special care not to include innuendo or literary imagery that could be misinterpreted, such as passages from Winnie the Pooh, given that a bear is considered the national symbol of Russia. The Soviets also asked, during the Carter administration, that Washington not send routine communications through the hotline. On New Year's Eve and on August 30, the hotline's anniversary, greetings replace the test messages. Upon receipt of the message at the NMCC, the message is translated into English, and both the original Russian and the translated English texts are transmitted to the White House Situation Room. However, if the message were to indicate \\"an imminent disaster, such as an accidental nuclear strike\\", the MOLINK team would telephone the gist of the message to the Situation Room duty officer who would brief the president before a formal translation was complete. Political criticism The Republican Party criticized the hotline in its 1964 national platform; it said the Kennedy administration had \\"sought accommodations with Communism without adequate safeguards and compensating gains for freedom. It has alienated proven allies by opening a 'hot line' first with a sworn enemy rather than with a proven friend, and in general pursued a risky path such as it began at Munich a quarter century ago.\\"Republican Party Platform, Section Two, \\"Weakness Before Communism\\" (adopted July 13, 1964). See http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25840 Technology ITT Intelex Teletype L015, as displayed in the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum. An East German Siemens T63-SU12 teleprinter from the hotline, as displayed in the National Cryptologic Museum of the NSA. The black box behind the teleprinter is an ETCRRM II encryption machine. In Finland there are still several signs marking the cable's location. This one is in Forssa. The text reads \\"Post and telegraph department\\". The cable was also used for the ordinary national telephone service. The Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline was intended for text only; speech might be misinterpreted. Leaders wrote in their native language and messages were translated at the receiving end. =Teletype= The first generation of the hotline used two full-time duplex telegraph circuits. The primary circuit was routed from Washington, D.C. via London, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki to Moscow. TAT-1, the first submarine transatlantic telephone cable carried messages from Washington to London. A secondary radio line for back-up and service messages linked Washington and Moscow via Tangier. This network was originally built by Harris Corporation. In July 1963 the United States sent four sets of teleprinters with the Latin alphabet to Moscow for the terminal there. A month later the Soviet equipment, four sets of East German teleprinters with the Cyrillic alphabet made by Siemens, arrived in Washington. The hotline started operations on August 30, 1963. =Encryption= A Norwegian-built device called Electronic Teleprinter Cryptographic Regenerative Repeater Mixer II (ETCRRM II) encrypted the teletype messages. This used the unbreakable one- time pad cryptosystem. Each country delivered keying tapes used to encode its messages via its embassy abroad. An advantage of the one-time pad was that neither country had to reveal more sensitive encryption methods to the other.David Kahn, The Codebreakers, pp. 715-716https://www.dn.no/DNtv/video/2017/12/07/1438/norges-ukjente-rolle-i- den-hete-linjen From December 1963 until November 1967 there were NO one-time pads used to encrypt messages between the U.S. and the USSR. It was strictly the ETCRTM one-time tape. =Satellite= In September 1971, Moscow and Washington decided to upgrade the system. The countries also agreed for the first time when the line should be used. Specifically, they agreed to notify each other immediately in the event of an accidental, unauthorized or unexplained incident involving a nuclear weapon that could increase the risk of nuclear war. Two new satellite communication lines supplemented the terrestrial circuits using two U.S. Intelsat satellites, and two Soviet Molniya II satellites. This arrangement lasted from 1971 to 1978; it made the radio link via Tangier redundant. =Facsimile= In May 1983, President Reagan proposed to upgrade the hotline by the addition of high-speed facsimile capability. The Soviet Union and the United States agreed formally to do this on July 17, 1984. According to the agreement, upgrades were to take place through use of Intelsat satellites and modems, facsimile machines, and computers. The facsimile terminals were operational by 1986. The teletype circuits were cut in 1988 after several years of testing and use proved the fax links to be reliable. The Soviets transferred the hotline link to the newer, geostationary Gorizont-class satellites of the Stationar system.Stephen L. Thacher, Crisis Communications between Superpowers, US Army War College, Carusle Barracks, 1990, p. 10. =Email= In 2007, the Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline was upgraded; a dedicated computer network links Moscow and Washington. The new system started operations on January 1, 2008. It continues to use the two satellite links but a fiber optic cable replaced the old back- up cable. Commercial software is used for both chat and email: chat to coordinate operations, and email for actual messages. Transmission is nearly instantaneous, given the speed of light and the exigent importance of the communications system. Usage The first message transmitted over the hotline was on August 30, 1963. Washington sent Moscow the text: \\"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog's back 1234567890\\". This included all the Latin alphabet, as well as all Arabic numerals and the apostrophe, to test that the keyboard and printer were working correctly. The primary link was accidentally cut several times, for example near Copenhagen by a Danish bulldozer operator, and by a Finnish farmer who plowed it up once. Regular testing of both the primary and backup links took place daily. During the even hours, the US sent test messages to the Soviet Union. In the odd hours, the Soviet Union sent test messages to the US. The first official use of the hotline by the United States was when John F. Kennedy was assassinated on 22 November 1963. The first official use by the Soviet Union was on 5 June 1967 during the outbreak of the Six-Day War. The Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline was also used during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War; during the Yom Kippur War (1973 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War), when there was a United States nuclear alert; in 1974, when Turkey invaded Cyprus; in 1979, when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, and several times during the Reagan Administration, with the Soviets querying about events in Lebanon and the United States commenting on the situation in Poland. On October 31, 2016, the Moscow‚ÄìWashington hotline was used to reinforce Barack Obama's September warning that the U.S. would consider any interference on Election Day a grave matter. Other hotlines with Moscow Another hotline for record communications between Washington and Moscow is part of the American Nuclear Risk Reduction Center and the Russian National Nuclear Risk Reduction Center, which was initiated by Ronald Reagan in 1988. In 2012, it was announced that a proposal was being negotiated with Moscow to add cyber warfare to the topics to be discussed on the hotline. James Turner Stephens, Jr., built a global phone connection between Washington D.C. and Moscow in October 1941. The call from Washington D.C. went from the White House to Washington 1, the primary phone connection exiting Washington D.C., to Hawaii, the Philippines, Tokyo, China, the Siberian Railway and finally to Moscow. Moscow called across Europe under the cover of a company controlled by communists and then to Manhattan to an office on the upper east side. It went from this office to the Rockefeller Center where the Office of the Coordinator of Information and British Intelligence occupied and then to the AT&T; headquarters at 32 Six Avenue. From there it went to the Washington 2 location to then connect to the White House. By doing this, at no point along the phone circuit could anyone hear both Moscow and Washington D.C. at the same time. http://www.voderst.com In popular culture A non-dial \\"Red Phone\\" which is on display in the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum. This telephone is actually a prop, erroneously representing the hotline between Washington and Moscow.The red phone that was NOT on the Hotline, August 30, 2013 In numerous television series, movies, video games and other places, the hotline between Washington and Moscow is represented by a red phone, although the real hotline never was a telephone line. A hotline telephone was depicted in the film Fail-Safe as the \\"Red 1 / Ultimate 1 Touch phone\\", and also in Stanley Kubrick's film Dr. Strangelove, both from 1964 and both loosely based on Peter George's Cold War thriller novel Red Alert from 1958. A more realistic depiction of the Hotline was Tom Clancy's novel The Sum of All Fears from 1991 and its 2002 film adaptation, in which a text-based computer communications system was depicted, resembling the actual Hotline equipment from the 1980s and 1990s. In the 1990 HBO film By Dawn's Early Light, the White House Situation Room equipment that receives the (translated) hotline message, apparently relayed by the Pentagon- NMCC MOLINK team, is depicted as a teleprinter (and not as a fax machine, the technology already in use at the NMCC itself by that year). A telephone is used in the intro cinematic of the video game Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2. The call is placed by the US president to the Kremlin in the wake of a global Soviet invasion.YouTube ‚Äì Red Alert 2 intro =Political advertising= The \\"red phone\\" was the centerpiece of television commercials used in the 1984 Democratic primary and 1984 presidential election and the 2008 Democratic primary elections. In 1984, an advertisement made by Bob Beckel and Roy Spence on behalf of candidate Walter Mondale suggested that \\"The most awesome, powerful responsibility in the world lies in the hand that picks up this phone.\\" The advertisement was intended to raise questions about candidate Gary Hart's readiness for the presidency.YouTube ‚Äì US Democrats ‚Äì Walter Mondale 1984 Video 10 The red phone was also featured prominently in an advertisement from that year targeting President Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.

It is located approximately 14 km (9 mi) off the coast of French Guiana in South America just north of the town of Kourou. It has an area of 14 ha (34.6 acres). The island was a part of a controversial French penal colony located in French Guiana for 101 years, from 1852 to 1953. Although it was the smallest part of the penal colony, it is notorious for being used for internal exile of French political prisoners during that period. Excerpt from the People's Almanac, posted at \\"trivia-library.com The most famous political prisoner on Devil's Island was Captain Alfred Dreyfus. Use as a penal colony √éle du Diable is rocky and palm-covered. It rises above sea level. Its development as a penal colony was begun in 1852 by the government of Emperor Napoleon III. The island is surrounded by rocky promontories and shoals, strong cross-currents and shark-infested waters. Landing on the island by boat is so treacherous that prison officials constructed a cable car system to connect the island to the nearby √éle Royale. They used the cable car for years to travel the 180 m (600 ft)-wide channel between the two islands.

Newspapers are circulated either nationally, by region (such as Kant≈ç or Kansai), by each prefecture, or by each city. Some newspapers publish as often as two times a day (morning and evening editions) while others publish weekly, monthly, quarterly, or even yearly. The five leading national daily newspapers in Japan are the Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, the Yomiuri Shimbun, Sankei Shimbun and the Nikkei Shimbun. The first two are generally considered liberal/left leaning while the latter three are considered conservative/right leaning. The most popular national daily English-language newspaper in Japan is The Japan Times. Brief history fall of Osaka Castle, 17th century Japanese newspapers began in the 17th century as yomiuri (Ë™≠Â£≤„ÄÅliterally \\"to read and sell\\") or kawaraban (Áì¶Áâà, literally \\"tile-block printing\\" referring to the use of clay printing blocks), which were printed handbills sold in major cities to commemorate major social gatherings or events. The first modern newspaper was the Nagasaki Shipping List and Advertiser, which was published bi-weekly by the Englishman A. W. Hansard. The first edition appeared on 22 June 1861. In November of the same year, Hansard moved the paper to Yokohama and renamed it as the Japan Herald. In 1862, the Tokugawa shogunate began publishing the Kampan batabiya shinbun, a translated edition of a widely distributed Dutch government newspaper. These two papers were published for foreigners, and contained only foreign news. The first Japanese daily newspaper that covered foreign and domestic news was the Yokohama Mainichi Shinbun (Ê®™ÊµúÊØéÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû), first published in 1871. Newspapers at this time can be divided into two types, ≈åshinbun (Â§ßÊñ∞ËÅû, \\"large newspapers\\") and koshinbun (Â∞èÊñ∞ËÅû, \\"small newspapers\\"). People commonly referred to ≈åshinbun as \\"political forums\\" because these papers were inextricably tied to the Popular Rights Movement (Ëá™Áî±Ê∞ëÊ®©ÈÅãÂãï, \\"Jiy≈´ minken und≈ç\\") and its demands for establishing a Diet. After the government's official announcement of the formation of the Diet, these newspapers, such as the Yokohama Mainichi Shinbun and the Ch≈´gai shinbun, became organs of the political parties. The early readers of these newspapers mostly came from the ranks of the former samurai class. Koshinbun, on the other hand, were more plebeian, popular newspapers that contained local news, human interest stories, and light fiction. Examples of koshinbun were the Tokyo nichinichi shinbun (Êù±‰∫¨Êó•Êó•Êñ∞ËÅû), the predecessor of the present day Mainichi shinbun, which began in 1872; the Yomiuri shinbun, which began in 1874; and the Asahi shinbun, which began in 1879. In the 1880s, government pressure led to a gradual weeding out of ≈åshinbun, and the koshinbun started becoming more similar to the modern, \\"impartial\\" newspapers. Throughout their history, Japanese newspapers have had a central role in issues of free speech and freedom of the press. In the period of \\"Taish≈ç Democracy\\" in the 1910s to the 1920s, the government worked to suppress newspapers such as the Asahi shinbun for their critical stance against government bureaucracy that favored protecting citizens' rights and constitutional democracy. In the period of growing militarism to the outbreak of total war in the 1930s to the 1940s, newspapers faced intense government censorship and control. After Japan's defeat, strict censorship of the press continued as the American occupiers used government control in order to inculcate democratic and anti-communist values. In 1951, the American occupiers finally returned freedom of the press to Japan, which is the situation today based on the Article 21 of the Constitution of Japan. Reproductions of Japanese newspapers Listed below is an overview of reproductions of the three major Japanese daily newspapers, the Yomiuri shinbun, the Asahi shinbun, and the Mainichi shinbun. These historical newspapers are available in three major forms, as CD-ROMs, as microfilm, and as shukusatsuban (Á∏ÆÂà∑Áâà, literally, \\"reduced-sized print editions\\"). Shukusatsuban is a technology popularized by Asahi shinbun in the 1930s as a way to compress and archive newspapers by reducing the size of the print to fit multiple pages of a daily newspaper onto one page. Shukusatsuban are geared towards libraries and archives, and are usually organized and released by month. These resources are available at many leading research universities throughout the world (usually universities with reputable Japanese studies programs). One will need to check each individual library's collection for information about the availability of these sources. WorldCat is a good starting point. =Yomiuri shinbun= In 1999, the Yomiuri shinbun released a CD-ROM titled The Yomiuri shinbun in the Meiji Era, which provides a searchable index of news articles and images from the period. Subsequent CD- ROMs, The Taisho Era, The Prewar Showa Era I and The Prewar Showa Era II, were completed eight years after the project was first conceived. Postwar Recovery, the first part of a postwar Showa Era series that includes newspaper stories and images until 1960, is forthcoming. Issues of Yomiuri shinbun printed since 1998 are also available as an online resource through Lexis-Nexis Academic. =Asahi shinbun= The Asahi shinbun has a CD-ROM database consisting of an index of headlines and sub-headlines from the years 1945‚Äì1999. A much more expensive full-text searchable database is available only at the Harvard- Yenching Library at Harvard University, which notably includes advertisements in its index. Researchers using other university libraries would probably have to first use the CD-ROM index, and then look into the microfilm or shukusatsuban versions. Microfilm versions are available from 1888; shukusatsuban versions are available from 1931. Issues of the Asahi shinbun printed since August 1984 are available through Lexis-Nexis Academic. =Mainichi shinbun= Microfilm versions of the Mainichi shinbun are available for the years 1984‚Äì2005, and shukusatsuban are available from 1950 to 1983. Issues of the Mainichi shinbun printed since 27 March 1998, are available through Factiva.

Early life His father was a trader, exporting bananas. He studied in Durban at Marine College and then at the age of 17 went to Britain to finish high school, and he then studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Anti-Apartheid Activism Naicker was a leading member of South African Indian Congress (SAIC) and the Natal Indian Congress. In 1946 he and Yusuf Dadoo led passive resistance campaigns among Indian South Africans to protest the Asiatic Land Tenure and the Indian Representation Act. Along with Yusuf Dadoo of the Transvaal Indian Congress he visited India, where he received support for the endeavours of the South African Indians from Mahatma Gandhi and other Indian leaders in 1947. Naicker was an early advocate for a multi-racial united front against apartheid. He worked to develop an alliance with the African National Congress (ANC) in 1947, known as the Dadoo-Naicker- Xuma Pact, or the Three Doctors' Pact. Naicker was imprisoned numerous times for anti-apartheid activism. In 1948 he and Yusuf Dadoo were sentenced to six months hard labour under the Immigrant Regulation Act. He was jailed for a month after participating the Defiance campaign of 1952. During the 1950s Naicker was president of the SAIC for at least two terms, despite being forbidden to attend gatherings by the Apartheid government in 1953. Naicker was one of the accused in the Treason Trial of 1956-1961 but the charges against him and several other co-defendants were dropped in 1958. Between 1956 and 1973 he was regularly banned, which limited his political activities. Sources External links *ANC biography *Don't support apartheid sport: Appeal by Chief A. J. Lutuli and Dr. G. M.

Overview Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue is a charity organization funded partly by membership fees, partly by donations, and partly by government subsidies. It employs 197 professional seamen, 60 at the head office in Oslo, and 14 in the regional branches. The organization has 4,200 volunteers, and around 111,000 paying members. Pleasure craft owners can sign up for a \\"totalmedlemsskap\\" (Total Membership), a service and assistance package deal. The organization's vision is \\"None Shall Drown\\". The organization publishes the quarterly magazine RS-Magasinet. = Vessels = 260x260px 260x260px The organization operates 51 vessels stationed along the Norwegian coastline, as well as one each stationed on the lakes of Femunden and Mj√∏sa. 26 of the rescue craft along the coast are larger, permanently manned, sea-going, aluminium-hulled craft called redningssk√∏yte (Rescue Cruisers). The other are smaller craft manned by voluntary sj√∏redningskorps (Rescue Corps). There were 7,869 launches in 2017, assisting 21,190 persons, including saving 35 lives and 111 vessels. The organization also operates four ambulance vessels on the coast of Helgeland and Nordland.260x260px = Official mascot = The society's official mascot is Elias the Little Rescue Boat, who is the main character of an animated series on national television, books and merchandise. Elias is used by local chapters of the society to teach children about safety at sea. The TV series were nominated for best children's TV series in the Emmy Awards. History 260x260pxInspired by the British RNLI, the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue was founded by the Kristiania Kj√∏bmannsforening (Kristiania Merchant's Association) in Kristiania (now Oslo) 9 July 1891, with the goal of increasing safety at sea by rescuing lives and property. The first rescue boat went into service in 1893. All vessels names carry the prefix \\"RS\\" (for \\"Redningssk√∏yte\\") and a number. Until 1893 the organization used pilot craft designed by Colin Archer. The first boat purpose-built for the organization was RS 5 Liv, which was the result of a design competition won by Christian Stephansen. After some design changes by Colin Archer, the craft was built in 1893‚Äì1894. She served until 1934, rescuing 132 lives, saved 41 ships and assisted 1338 others. The first ship class commissioned by the Norwegian Society for Sea Rescue was the Colin Archer class, designed by Colin Archer but drawing heavily on experience from the work with \\"Liv\\". The first ship of the class, 'RS 1 Colin Archer was launched in 1894. It served until 1933, rescued 274 lives and 67 ships, and assisted 1522 ships. The extremely rugged Colin Archer class sailing vessels became iconic in Norway, and to this day several of the class are used as private pleasure craft, or preserved in museums. The class is still popular today, and vessels are still built based on Archer's drawings. An updated and motorized design by Bjarne Aas was launched in 1932, with RS 38 Biskop Hvoslef being the first in class.

Biography Rangjung Dorje visited China, where the emperor Toghon Temur became his disciple. Upon his death, Rangjung Dorje's face is said to have appeared in the moon there. As a group, the Karmapa Lamas were among the earliest recognized Tulku, or lamas reincarnated as deities or lineage of deceased teachers. The first Karmapas were influential in the Yuan and Ming courts as well as the Tangut Western Xia Kingdom. Lineage Born to a Nyingma family, Rangjung Dorje was a lineage- holder in both the Kagyu and the Nyingma (Dzogchen): Teachings and influence =Buddha-nature and shentong= In 1321 the famous scholar Dolpopa (1292-1361) visited Tsurphu Monastery for the first time and had extensive discussions with Rangjung Dorje about doctrinal issues. It appears that Rangjung Dorje almost certainly influenced the development of some of Dolpopa's theories, possibly including his Zhentong (gzhan stong) method.Stearns, Cyrus (1999).

According to Karma phrin las, Dri lan yid, 91-92, his teacher, Ch√∂drak Gyatso, the Seventh Karmapa, interpreted the nature of Zhentong (gzhan stong) accepted by Rangjung Dorje.Stearns, Cyrus (1999).

While all music was once acoustic, the retronym \\"acoustic music\\" appeared after the advent of electric instruments, such as the electric guitar, electric violin, electric organ and synthesizer. Acoustic string instrumentations had long been a subset of popular music, particularly in folk. It stood in contrast to various other types of music in various eras, including big band music in the pre-rock era, and electric music in the rock era. Music reviewer Craig Conley suggests, \\"When music is labeled acoustic, unplugged, or unwired, the assumption seems to be that other types of music are cluttered by technology and overproduction and therefore aren't as pure\\".  Types of acoustic instruments  Acoustic instruments can be split into six groups: string instruments, wind instruments, percussion, other instruments, ensemble instruments, and unclassified instruments. String instruments have a tightly stretched string, that, when set in motion creates energy at (almost) harmonically related frequencies. Wind instruments are in the shape of a pipe and energy is supplied as an air stream into the pipe. Percussion instruments make sound when they are struck, as with a hand or a stick.  History  The original acoustic instrument was the human voice, which produces sound by funneling air across the vocal cords. The first constructed acoustic instrument is believed to be the flute. The oldest surviving flute is as much as 43,000 years old. The flute is believed to have originated in Central Europe.Iain Morley, \\"The Evolutionary Origins and Archaeology of Music\\", PhD diss. (Cambridge: Darwin College, Cambridge University, 2003): 47‚Äì48. By 1800, the most popular acoustic plucked-string instruments closely resembled the modern day guitar, but with a smaller body. As the century continued, luthier Antonio de Torres Jurado from Spain took these smaller instruments and expanded the bodies to create guitars. Guitar use and popularity grew throughout the 19th century and more acoustic instruments were crafted, such as the double bass. As electric instruments took hold during the 20th century, many stringed instruments were redefined as acoustic. Instruments that involve striking or vibrating the strings, such as the violin, viola and cello, fall under the acoustic category. The violin became popular during the 16th and 17th centuries, due to technological advancements in building them, brought on by luthiers such as Antonio Stradivari and Andrea Amati. The modern version of the instrument developed gradually from older European acoustic stringed instruments such as the lira.

Tice (born 1961) is a former intelligence analyst for the United States Air Force, Office of Naval Intelligence, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and National Security Agency (NSA). In December, 2005, Tice helped spark a national controversy over claims that the NSA and the DIA were engaged in unlawful and unconstitutional wiretaps on American citizens. He later admitted that he was one of the sources for the 2005 New York Times reporting on the wiretapping activities. After speaking publicly about the need for legislation to protect whistleblowers, Tice received national attention as the first NSA-whistleblower in May 2005 before Thomas Andrews Drake, Mark Klein, Thomas Tamm, and Edward Snowden came forward. Career Tice worked as an intelligence analyst for the U.S. Air Force, Office of Naval Intelligence, and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). During his nearly 20-year career with various United States government agencies, he conducted intelligence missions related to the Kosovo War, Afghanistan, the USS Cole bombing in Yemen, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Tice was transferred from the Defense Intelligence Agency to the National Security Agency in 2002. In April 2001 Tice reported his suspicions that an Asian-American woman he was working with was a Chinese spy, saying she had voiced sympathies for China, traveled extensively abroad and displayed affluence beyond her means.Patrick Radden Keefe (17 January 2006), The Professional Paranoid SlateChris Strohm (19 January 2006), Ex-NSA official seeks avenue for sharing new allegations Government Executive Tice was told his suspicions were unfounded. After moving to the NSA, Tice continued to report his concerns. In April 2003, he wrote an email to the person at DIA handling his suspicions \\"questioning the competence of counterintelligence at FBI\\" and stating that he suspected he was being electronically monitored. According to Tice the DIA told him there was \\"reason to be concerned\\" about the female DIA analyst being a spy. Shortly thereafter an NSA security officer ordered Tice to report for a \\"psychological evaluation\\", even though he had done so only nine months earlier. The psychologist from the Department of Defense concluded that Tice suffered from psychotic paranoia. In a statement written to the Inspector General, Tice stated that the psychologist \\"did this even though he admitted that I did not show any of the normal indications of someone suffering from paranoia\\". Tice said that three other psychiatric evaluations, including two at the NSA, showed he was normal and just two found him mentally unbalanced. Tice would later say that \\"I knew from that day that my career was over.\\" Tice's security clearance was suspended and he was reassigned to maintaining vehicles in the motor pool for 8 months in what Tice considered \\"administrative punishment.\\" He had been nominated to receive a medal for work he had done during the Iraq war, but after his clearance was suspended it was withdrawn. The Pentagon Inspector General's office investigated the NSA for possibly retaliating against Tice. A defense official said Tice seemed 'to have been punished unfairly' and that it appeared he had communicated \\"substantive concerns\\". Tice claimed he was \\"being retaliated against because [he] followed the rules and reported suspicious behavior\\". Whistleblower Tice was dismissed by the NSA in May 2005, just days after publicly urging Congress to pass stronger protections for federal intelligence agency whistleblowers facing retaliation, and claiming that whistleblowers were being punished. In September 2005, the Inspector General issued an unclassified report that found \\"no evidence\\" to support Tice's claims. According to Tice, claims that he had psychological problems are \\"bunk\\" and that 'that's the way the NSA deals with troublemakers and whistleblowers'. In December 2005, Tice alleged that both (NSA) and the DIA were engaged in unlawful and unconstitutional conduct against the American people, sparking a national controversy. Tice stated that the activities involved the Director of the NSA, the Deputies Chief of Staff for Air and Space Operations, and the U.S. Secretary of Defense, and were conducted via very highly sensitive intelligence programs and operations known as special access programs (SAP), more commonly referred to as \\"black world\\" programs, or \\"black ops\\". Tice was a technical intelligence specialist dealing with SAP programs and operations at both NSA and DIA. On December 16, the New York Times revealed that the NSA was engaged in a clandestine eavesdropping program that bypassed the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court. Media reports on January 10, 2006, indicated Tice was a source of the Times leak, which revealed that, under the direction of the White House and without requisite court orders, the NSA has been intercepting international communications to and from points within the United States. In a letter dated December 18, 2005, to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and to Senator Pat Roberts, Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, he said he was prepared to testify about the SAP programs, under the provisions of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act. It is not known, however, what the testimony would specifically involve. It has been assumed that the problem concerned the electronic surveillance of Americans, but in an interview published 13 January 2006, Tice said: > there's no way the programs I want to talk to Congress about should be > public ever, unless maybe in 200 years they want to declassify them. You > should never learn about it; no one at the Times should ever learn about > these things. But that same mechanism that allows you to have a program like > this at an extremely high, sensitive classification level could also be used > to mask illegality, like spying on Americans. In a press release issued by the National Security Whistleblowers Coalition on December 22, 2005, Tice explained the public aspect of his charges, stating that, \\"As a Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) officer it is continually drilled into us that the very first law chiseled in the SIGINT equivalent of the Ten Commandments (USSID-18) is that Thou shall not spy on American persons without a court order from FISA. This law is continually drilled into each NSA intelligence officer throughout his or her career. The very people that lead the National Security Agency have violated this holy edict of SIGINT\\". On December 23, 2005, the Austin American-Statesman reported Tice's allegations that spying on Americans may involve a massive computer system known as ECHELON, which is able to search and filter hundreds of thousands of phone calls and e-mails in seconds. On January 3, 2006, Tice appeared on the national radio/TV show Democracy Now! and said he wanted to testify before Congress. Tice said \\"I'm involved with some certain aspects of the intelligence community, which are very closely held, and I believe I have seen some things that are illegal\\". On January 5, 2006, The Washington Times reported that Tice wanted to testify before Congress about electronic intelligence programs that he asserted were carried out illegally by the NSA and DIA. \\"I intend to report to Congress probable unlawful and unconstitutional acts conducted while I was an intelligence officer with the National Security Agency and with the Defense Intelligence Agency,\\" Tice stated in letters, dated December 16, 2005 and disclosed by the New York Times. In a letter dated January 10, 2006, Renee Seymour, Director of the NSA Special Access Programs Central Office, warned Tice that members of neither the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, nor of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence had clearance to receive the classified information about the SAP's that Tice was prepared to provide. An article by Chris Strohm in Government Executive says that some congressional staffers believe that Tice \\"comes with baggage\\". In reaction to Tice's claims, Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly, two prominent figures in conservative media, launched an offensive against his credibility. On his Fox News broadcast of January 11, 2006, O'Reilly said that Tice should be jailed for his whistleblowing activity. But Tice told ABC News that \\"As far as I'm concerned, as long as I don't say anything that's classified, I'm not worried ... We need to clean up the intelligence community. We've had abuses, and they need to be addressed.\\" On February 14, 2006, United Press International (UPI) reported Tice testified to the House Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations that the Special Access Program might have violated millions of Americans' Constitutional rights, but that neither the committee members nor the NSA inspector general had clearance to review the program. On May 12, 2006, ThinkProgress reported a story by CongressDaily in which Tice was said to be planning an appearance the next week, before the Senate Armed Service Committee, when further revelations would be made about \\"a different angle\\" of the NSA's surveillance program. Ultimately this did not occur and it is still unclear why. On July 26, 2006, he was subpoenaed to appear before a federal grand jury regarding violations of federal law. He stated, \\"This latest action by the government is designed only for one purpose: to ensure that people who witness criminal action being committed by the government are intimidated into remaining silent\\".NSA whistleblower is subpoenaed to testify before Federal Grand Jury July 28, 2006 On January 21 and 22, 2009, Tice appeared on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann and stated that while he worked in the NSA, his role was to follow the communications of specific individuals in a program separate from the one that had been previously disclosed. Tice also stated that programs were given dual military and intelligence status so that both types of congressional oversight could be simultaneously denied. Tice said he initially understood that he was to identify the communication methods of journalists (and entire news organizations) so that they could avoid collection. He said it was difficult for him to communicate securely after he became a whistleblower since \\"I knew all my communications were tapped, my phones, my computer, and I've had the FBI on me like flies\\". On the heels of the first Edward Snowden NSA disclosures in 2013, Tice was asked during an interview on All In with Chris Hayes, \\"What was your experience in trying to blow the whistle from inside the NSA? And does it make you understand why Snowden might have done what he did?\\" Tice replied, Asked in June 2013 by The Guardian to comment on the early revelations about phone data collection by the NSA, Tice said: \\"What is going on is much larger and more systemic than anything anyone has ever suspected or imagined ... I figured it would probably be about 2015 [before the NSA had] the computer capacity ... to collect all digital communications word for word ... But I think I'm wrong. I think they have it right now.\\" Later during the summer of 2013 Tice alleged that during his employment with the NSA, the agency had a program that targeted the phone and computer conversations, word for word, members of Congress, the Supreme Court, Admirals and Generals, and that the NSA had wiretapped Barack Obama while he was a Senate candidate, saying he had seen and held papers ordering such actions. Tice claimed the surveillance extended to lawyers and law firms, judges (one of whom, Samuel Alitoyoutu.be/d6m1XbWOfVk?t=3m1s NSA Blackmailing Obama?  Interview with Whistleblower Russ Tice, Breaking the Set, Abby Martin, Published Jul 9, 2013 \\"is now sitting on the Supreme Court ... two are former FISA court judges\\"), State Department officials, people \\"in the executive service that were part of the White House\\", antiwar groups, US companies and banking and financial firms that do international business, NGOs and humanitarian groups such as the Red Cross, and antiwar civil rights groups. In his opinion, this 'wide-ranging' surveillance could offer intelligence agencies 'unthinkable power to blackmail their opponents'. Tice said he was \\"worried that the intelligence community now has sway over what is going on\\". Tice gave an example in an interview with RT, saying \\"I noticed that the intelligence community is not being hit with the sequester ... Is there some kind of leverage that is being placed on our three branches of government to make sure that the intelligence community gets what they want? In other words, is the intelligence community running this country, not our government.\\"Iraq‚Äôs hell, anti-surveillance fashion, dissecting Syria war propaganda RT Interview with Russ Tice, 5 September 2013 See also * Hepting v.

The original site at Bayrischzell was soon abandoned for unsuitability and lack of water. Nor did the monastery remain long at Fischbachau; the community moved on, for much the same reasons as before, to yet another site at the little village of Petersberg, and from there a final time to Scheyern, where they remained and which became Scheyern Abbey. A small priory or cell remained however at Fischbachau, which was from then on a priory or cell of Scheyern, centred on the church of Saint Martin. This was refurbished in about 1700 in the Rococo style, of which it remains a spectacular example. The monastic community was dissolved during secularisation in 1803, and only the church is left.

Since the salinity affects both the electrical conductivity and the specific gravity of a solution, a salinometer often consist of an ec meter or hydrometer and some means of converting those readings to a salinity reading. A salinometer may be calibrated in either micromhos, a unit of electrical conductivity, (usually 0-22) or else directly calibrated for salt in 'grains per gallon' (0-0.5). A typical reading on-board ship would be 2 micromhos or 0.05 grains per gallon. A reading of twice this may trigger a warning light or alarm. Applications Fresh water generators (Evaporators) use salinometers on the distillate discharge in order to gauge the quality of the water. Water from the evaporator can be destined for potable water supplies, so salty water is not desirable for human consumption. In some ships, extremely high quality distillate is required for use in water- tube boilers, where salt water would be disastrous. In these ships, a salinometer is also installed on the feed system where it would alert the engineer to any salt contamination.

Development Williams International had been building small turbofan engines for cruise missile applications since the 1960s, and had successfully entered the general aviation market in 1992 with the FJ44 engine. That same year, NASA initiated a program, Advanced General Aviation Transport Experiments (AGATE), to partner with manufacturers and help develop technologies that would revitalize the sagging general aviation industry. In 1996, Williams joined AGATE's General Aviation Propulsion (GAP) program to develop a fuel-efficient turbofan engine that would be even smaller than the FJ44 and designated the FJX-2 engine. Initially, Williams contracted with Burt Rutan's Scaled Composites to design and build the Williams V-Jet II, a Very Light Jet (VLJ) to use as a testbed and technology demonstrator to showcase the new engine. The aircraft, powered by two interim FJX-1 man-rated version of Williams' cruise-missile engine, debuted at the 1997 Oshkosh Airshow. Development of the FJX-2 engine progressed, most of the design work was completed during 1998 with initial prototype parts being delivered in the second quarter of that year. The FJX-2 engine was designed with many experimental systems and manufacturing processes to minimize parts count and lower production costs and having a bypass ratio of 4:1. As a result, there were many technical difficulties and failures of the initial prototype hardware. However, subsequent re-designs and the incorporation of more conventional systems resulted in the engine eventually meeting the NASA requirement of thrust. The program ultimately culminated with altitude testing at the NASA Glenn Research Propulsion Systems Laboratory from March - April 2000. In 2000, Williams joined with Eclipse Aviation to develop an FAA- certified version of the FJX-2, designated the EJ22, to be used on the Eclipse 500 VLJ due for first flight in June 2002. This would be an unprecedentedly short period of time to develop a new man-rated turbofan engine. The new EJ22 powered the Eclipse 500 prototype on its first flight in the Summer of 2002. Eclipse initially required the engine to produce thrust, exceeding the rating of the FJX-2 by 10%. This was only the first of a large number of continuously changing requirements Eclipse would demand. Ultimately, numerous technical problems with the EJ22, significantly compounded by the frequently changing requirements of Eclipse Aviation, grounded the plane and prompted Eclipse Aviation to terminate its relationship with Williams International in late 2002. Following termination of the contract, development work and FAA certification was halted shortly thereafter.. To achieve the required TSFC, the EJ22 turbofan was designed as a three spool engine having a fan, two axial compressors and three expansion turbines. As a result, the engine was significantly more complicated than any prior Williams International engine. While very impressive on the test stand, the EJ22 proved quite temperamental during the two years of its development process and it was frequently subject to problems starting, overheating, part failures and various subsystem issues. While most of the problems may have eventually been resolved during a normal development program, the shortened development period, and the frequent changes by Eclipse, proved to be insurmountable obstacles.

Her father was the third son of Sir William Twysden, 5th Baronet of Roydon Hall, East Peckham, Kent, by his wife and second cousin Jane Twisden. A scandal surrounded the death of her father on 2 November 1752; he was allegedly shot while attempting to rob a stagecoach near London.The story usually provided is that the Bishop was staying with his brother the Baronet. The Baronet had summoned his doctor down from London. Overnight, the Bishop was observed surreptitiously removing the charges from the doctor's pistols. The next morning the Bishop left early.

In March 1770, barely a month past her 17th birthday, Frances married George Villiers, the 4th Earl of Jersey (1735‚Äì1805), a 34-year-old peer who had succeeded to his father's peerage in August 1769. The year before, the 4th Earl had been appointed a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King George III. Her husband was appointed Master of Horse to the Prince of Wales in 1795. Royal affairs Lady Jersey by Thomas Beach. The future George IV began an affair with Lady Jersey, then a 40-year-old grandmother and mother of ten, in 1793. She was also romantically involved with other members of the English aristocracy, including the 5th Earl of Carlisle. It was not until 1794 that she lured the Prince of Wales away from Maria Fitzherbert, with whom he had undergone a form of marriage in a clandestine Church of England ceremony that all parties to it knew was invalid under the Royal Marriages Act 1772. Having encouraged the Prince of Wales to marry his first cousin, Caroline of Brunswick in 1794, to whom she was appointed Lady of the Bedchamber, Lady Jersey nevertheless made Caroline's life uncomfortable. In the long term, this made little difference, since the Prince and Princess of Wales had very little regard for each other, and after the birth of their child Princess Charlotte of Wales, they lived apart during their twenty-five year marriage. This left an emotional void for the Prince of Wales that Frances and other mistresses continued to fill, as did Mrs. Fitzherbert. Since Lady Jersey enjoyed the favour of Queen Charlotte, even the displeasure of George III was not enough to threaten her position, and she continued to run the Prince of Wales' life and household for some time. In about 1803, her previously undisputed place as senior mistress to the Prince of Wales was challenged by his infatuation with Lady Hertford. In 1807, he replaced Lady Jersey, and she lost her position as Lady of the Bedchamber, and would come to have no active involvement with the royal court.

Tyrannosauroids lived on the Laurasian supercontinent beginning in the Jurassic Period. By the end of the Cretaceous Period, tyrannosauroids were the dominant large predators in the Northern Hemisphere, culminating in the gigantic Tyrannosaurus. Fossils of tyrannosauroids have been recovered on what are now the continents of North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia. Tyrannosauroids were bipedal carnivores, as were most theropods, and were characterized by numerous skeletal features, especially of the skull and pelvis. Early in their existence, tyrannosauroids were small predators with long, three-fingered forelimbs. Late Cretaceous genera became much larger, including some of the largest land-based predators ever to exist, but most of these later genera had proportionately small forelimbs with only two digits. Primitive feathers have been identified in fossils of two species and may have been present in other tyrannosauroids as well. Prominent bony crests in a variety of shapes and sizes on the skulls of many tyrannosauroids may have served display functions. Description Size of some small genera, compared to a human. Tyrannosauroids varied widely in size, although there was a general trend towards increasing size over time. Early tyrannosauroids were small animals. One specimen of Dilong, almost fully grown, measured 1.6 meters (5.3 ft) in length, and a fully-grown Guanlong measured 3 meters (10 ft long). Teeth from lower Lower Cretaceous rocks (140 to 136 million years old) of Hyogo, Japan, appear to have come from an approximately long animal, possibly indicating an early size increase in the lineage. An immature Eotyrannus was over 4 meters (13 ft) in length, and a subadult Appalachiosaurus was estimated at more than 6 meters (20 ft) long, indicating that both genera reached larger sizes. The Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids ranged from the 9 meter (30 ft) Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus to Tyrannosaurus, which exceeded 12 meters (39 ft) in length and may have weighed more than 6400 kilograms (7 short tons). A 2010 review of the literature concluded that tyrannosaurs were \\"small- to mid-sized\\" for their first 80 million years but were \\"some of the largest terrestrial carnivores to ever live\\" in their last 20 million years. Skull and neck of Daspletosaurus, from the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. Skulls of early tyrannosauroids were long, low and lightly constructed, similar to other coelurosaurs, while later forms had taller and more massive skulls. Despite the differences in form, certain skull features are found in all known tyrannosauroids. The premaxillary bone is very tall, blunting the front of the snout, a feature which evolved convergently in abelisaurids. The nasal bones are characteristically fused, arched slightly upwards and often very roughly textured on their upper surface. The premaxillary teeth at the front of the upper jaw are shaped differently from the rest of the teeth, smaller in size and with a D-shaped cross section. In the lower jaw, a prominent ridge on the surangular bone extends sideways from just below the jaw joint, except in the basal Guanlong. Tyrannosauroids had S-shaped necks and long tails, as did most other theropods. Early genera had long forelimbs, about 60% the length of the hindlimb in Guanlong, with the typical three digits of coelurosaurs. The long forelimb persisted at least through the Early Cretaceous Eotyrannus, but is unknown in Appalachiosaurus. Derived tyrannosaurids have forelimbs strongly reduced in size, the most extreme example being Tarbosaurus from Mongolia, where the humerus was only one-quarter the length of the femur. The third digit of the forelimb was also reduced over time. This digit was unreduced in the basal Guanlong, while in Dilong it was more slender than the other two digits. Eotyrannus also had three functional digits on each hand. Tyrannosaurids had only two, although the vestigial metacarpal of the third are preserved in some well-preserved specimens. [abstract only] As in most coelurosaurs, the second digit of the hand is the largest, even when the third digit is not present. Characteristic features of the tyrannosauroid pelvis include a concave notch at the upper front end of the ilium, a sharply defined vertical ridge on the outside surface of the ilium, extending upwards from the acetabulum (hip socket), and a huge \\"boot\\" on the end of the pubis, more than half as long as the shaft of the pubis itself. These features are found in all known tyrannosauroids, including basal members Guanlong and Dilong. The pubis is not known in Aviatyrannis or Stokesosaurus but both show typical tyrannosauroid characters in the ilium. The hindlimbs of all tyrannosauroids, like most theropods, had four toes, although the first toe (the hallux) did not contact the ground. Tyrannosauroid hindlimbs are longer relative to body size than almost any other theropods, and show proportions characteristic of fast-running animals, including elongated tibiae and metatarsals. These proportions persist even in the largest adult Tyrannosaurus, despite its probable inability to run. The third metatarsal of tyrannosaurids was pinched at the top between the second and fourth, forming a structure known as the arctometatarsus. The arctometatarsus was also present in Appalachiosaurus but it is unclear whether it was found in Eotyrannus or Dryptosaurus. This structure was shared by derived ornithomimids, troodontids and caenagnathids, but was not present in basal tyrannosauroids like Dilong paradoxus, indicating convergent evolution. Classification Tyrannosaurus was named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1905, along with the family Tyrannosauridae. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words œÑœÖœÅŒ±ŒΩŒΩŒøœÇ ' ('tyrant') and œÉŒ±œÖœÅŒøœÇ ' ('lizard'). The superfamily name Tyrannosauroidea was first published in a 1964 paper by the British paleontologist Alick Walker. The suffix -oidea, commonly used in the name of animal superfamilies, is derived from the Greek ŒµŒπŒ¥ŒøœÇ ' ('form'). Skull of Proceratosaurus, a proceratosaurid from the Middle Jurassic of England. Skeleton of Appalachiosaurus, a non-tyrannosaurid tyrannosauroid from the Late Cretaceous of Eastern North America. Scientists have commonly understood Tyrannosauroidea to include the tyrannosaurids and their immediate ancestors. With the advent of phylogenetic taxonomy in vertebrate paleontology, however, the clade has received several more explicit definitions. The first was by Paul Sereno in 1998, where Tyrannosauroidea was defined as a stem-based taxon including all species sharing a more recent common ancestor with Tyrannosaurus rex than with neornithean birds. To make the family more exclusive, Thomas Holtz redefined it in 2004 to include all species more closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex than to Ornithomimus velox, Deinonychus antirrhopus or Allosaurus fragilis. Sereno published a new definition in 2005, using Ornithomimus edmontonicus, Velociraptor mongoliensis and Troodon formosus as external specifiers. The Sereno definition was adopted in a 2010 review. Some studies have suggested that the clade Megaraptora, usually considered to be allosauroids, are basal tyrannosauroids. However, other authors disputed the placement of megaraptorans within Tyrannosauroidea, and a study of megaraptoran hand anatomy published in 2016 caused even the original scientists suggesting their tyrannosauroid relationships to at least partly reject their prior conclusion.

ancestry has been the subject of much debate. For most of the twentieth century, tyrannosaurids were commonly accepted as members of the Carnosauria, which included almost all large theropods. Within this group, the allosaurids were often considered to be ancestral to tyrannosaurids. In the early 1990s, cladistic analyses instead began to place tyrannosaurids into the Coelurosauria, echoing suggestions first published in the 1920s. Tyrannosaurids are now universally considered to be large coelurosaurs. In 1994, Holtz grouped tyrannosauroids with elmisaurids, ornithomimosaurs and troodonts into a coelurosaurian clade called Arctometatarsalia based on a common ankle structure where the second and fourth metatarsals meet near the tarsal bones, covering the third metatarsal when viewed from the front. Basal tyrannosauroids like Dilong, however, were found with non-arctometatarsalian ankles, indicating that this feature evolved convergently. Arctometatarsalia has been dismantled and is no longer used by most paleontologists, with tyrannosauroids usually considered to be basal coelurosaurs outside Maniraptoriformes. One recent analysis found the family Coeluridae, including the Late Jurassic North American genera Coelurus and Tanycolagreus, to be the sister group of Tyrannosauroidea. The most basal tyrannosauroid known from complete skeletal remains is Guanlong, a representative of the family Proceratosauridae. Other early taxa include Stokesosaurus and Aviatyrannis, known from far less complete material. The better-known Dilong is considered slightly more derived than Guanlong and Stokesosaurus. Dryptosaurus, long a difficult genus to classify, has turned up in several recent analyses as a basal tyrannosauroid as well, slightly more distantly related to Tyrannosauridae than Eotyrannus and Appalachiosaurus. Alectrosaurus, a poorly known genus from Mongolia, is definitely a tyrannosauroid but its exact relationships are unclear. Other taxa have been considered possible tyrannosauroids by various authors, including Bagaraatan and Labocania. Siamotyrannus from the Early Cretaceous of Thailand was originally described as an early tyrannosaurid, but is usually considered a carnosaur today. Iliosuchus has a vertical ridge on the ilium reminiscent of tyrannosauroids and may in fact be the earliest known member of the superfamily, but not enough material is known to be sure. Below is a cladogram by Loewen et al. in 2013 that included most tyrannosauroid species known at the time of its publication. Phylogeography In 2018 authors Rafael Delcourt and Orlando Nelson Grillo published a phylogenetic analysis of Tyrannosauroidea which incorporated taxa from the ancient continent of Gondwana (which is today consist of the southern hemisphere), such as Santanaraptor and Timimus, whose placement in the group has been controversial. They have found that not only Santanaraptor and Timimus were placed as tyrannosaurs more derived than Dilong, but they have found in their analysis that tyrannosauroids were widespread in Laurasia and Gondwana since the Middle Jurassic. They have proposed new subclade names for Tyrannosaurioidea. The first is Pantyrannosauria referring to all non- proceratosaurid members of the group, while Eutyrannosauria for larger tyrannosaur taxa found in the northern hemisphere such as Dryptosaurus, Appalachiosaurus, Bistahieversor, and Tyrannosauridae. Below is their phylogeographic tree they have recovered, in which displays the phylogenetic relationships of the taxa as well as the continents those taxa have been found. Distribution The tyrannosauroids lived on the supercontinent Laurasia, which split from Gondwana in the Middle Jurassic, as well as on the northern continents, which separated from Laurasia later in the Mesozoic era. The earliest recognized tyrannosauroids lived in the Middle-Late Jurassic, including Guanlong and Kileskus from the Far East, Stokesosaurus from the western United States and Aviatyrannis, Juratyrant, and Proceratosaurus from Europe. Confirmed tyrannosauroid fossils have only been discovered in the northern continents, with possible basal tyrannosauroid fossils reported from Australia. Late Cretaceous tyrannosauroids are known only from North America and Asia. Early Cretaceous tyrannosauroids are known from Laurasia, being represented by Eotyrannus from England and Dilong, Sinotyrannus, and Yutyrannus from northeastern China. Early Cretaceous tyrannosauroid premaxillary teeth are known from the Cedar Mountain Formation in Utah and the Tetori Group of Japan. The Middle Cretaceous record of Tyrannosauroidea is rather patchy. Teeth and indeterminate postcrania of this interval are known from the Cenomanian-age Dakota Formation of western North America and Potomac Formation of New Jersey, as well as formations in Kazakhstan and Tajikistan; two genera, Timurlengia and Xiongguanlong, have been found in Asia, while the Brazilian Santanaraptor may belong to this group. Suskityrannus has been found in the Moreno Hill Formation of the Zuni Basin of western New Mexico. The first unquestionable remains of tyrannosaurids occur in the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous in North America and Asia. Two subfamilies are recognized. The albertosaurines are only known from North America, while the tyrannosaurines are found on both continents. Tyrannosaurid fossils have been found in Alaska, which may have served as a land bridge allowing dispersal between the two continents. Non-tyrannosaurid tyrannosauroids like Alectrosaurus and possibly Bagaraatan were contemporaneous with tyrannosaurids in Asia, while they are absent from western North America. Eastern North America was divided by the Western Interior Seaway in the middle of the Cretaceous and isolated from the western portion of the continent. The absence of tyrannosaurids from the eastern part of the continent suggests that the family evolved after the appearance of the seaway, allowing basal tyrannosauroids like Dryptosaurus and Appalachiosaurus to survive in the east as a relict population until the end of the Cretaceous. Basal tyrannosauroids may have also been present in what is now southeastern Australia during the Aptian of the Early Cretaceous. NMV P186069, a partial pubis (a hip bone) with a distinctive tyrannosauroid-like form, was discovered in Dinosaur Cove in Victoria, indicating that tyrannosauroids were not limited to the northern continents as previously thought. Paleobiology =Facial integument= A study in 2017 study about a new tyrannosaurid named Daspletosaurus horneri was published in the journal Scientific Reports. Paleontologist Thomas Carr analyzed the texture on the facial bones of Daspletosaurus horneri and observed a hummocky rugosity which compared to crocodillian skulls and suggesting Daspletosaurus horneri including all tyrannosaurids having flat sensory scales and integumentary sensory organs. But a 2018 study rejected the idea of a facial sensory system in tyrannosauroids. Crocodilians don't really have flat sensory scales but only cracked dense epidermis. The hummocky rugosity in lizards and snakes have correlation with true squamose skin, a hummocky rugosity is also present in tyrannosaurids suggesting the presence of lizard-like scales on the face. =Body integument= Long filamentous structures have been preserved along with skeletal remains of numerous coelurosaurs from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation and other nearby geological formations from Liaoning, China. These filaments have usually been interpreted as \\"protofeathers,\\" homologous with the branched feathers found in birds and some non-avian theropods, although other hypotheses have been proposed. A skeleton of Dilong was described in 2004 that included the first example of feathers in a tyrannosauroid. Similarly to down feathers of modern birds, the feathers found in Dilong were branched but not pennaceous, and may have been used for insulation. Even large tyrannosauroids have been found with evidence of feathers. Yutyrannus huali, also from the Yixian Formation, is known from three specimens, each preserving traces of feathers on various parts of the body. While not all areas of the body preserve impressions across all three specimens, these fossils demonstrate that even in this medium-sized species, most of the body was covered in feathers. The presence of feathers in basal tyrannosauroids is not surprising since they are now known to be characteristic of coelurosaurs, found in other basal genera like Sinosauropteryx, as well as all more derived groups. Rare fossilized skin impressions of some Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids lack feathers, however, instead showing skin covered in fine, non-overlapping scales. Possibly, feathers were present on other areas of the body: Preserved skin impressions are very small and come primarily from the legs, pelvic region, and underside of the tail, which either lack feathers or only covered in a light down in some modern larger ground-dwelling birds. Alternatively, secondary loss of feathers in large tyrannosaurids may be analogous with the similar loss of hair in the largest modern mammals like elephants, where a low surface area- to-volume ratio slows down heat transfer, making insulation by a coat of hair unnecessary or even detrimental. A precedent can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians, in which filamentous structures were lost and scales reappeared. =Head crests= The elaborate head crest of Guanlong, a basal tyrannosauroid from China. Bony crests are found on the skulls of many theropods, including numerous tyrannosauroids. The most elaborate is found in Guanlong, where the nasal bones support a single, large crest which runs along the midline of the skull from front to back. This crest was penetrated by several large foramina (openings) which reduced its weight. A less prominent crest is found in Dilong, where low, parallel ridges run along each side of the skull, supported by the nasal and lacrimal bones. These ridges curve inwards and meet just behind the nostrils, making the crest Y-shaped. The fused nasals of tyrannosaurids are often very rough-textured. Alioramus, a possible tyrannosaurid from Mongolia, bears a single row of five prominent bony bumps on the nasal bones; a similar row of much lower bumps is present on the skull of Appalachiosaurus, as well as some specimens of Daspletosaurus, Albertosaurus, and Tarbosaurus. In Albertosaurus, Gorgosaurus and Daspletosaurus, there is a prominent horn in front of each eye on the lacrimal bone. The lacrimal horn is absent in Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which instead have a crescent-shaped crest behind each eye on the postorbital bone. These head crests may have been used for display, perhaps for species recognition or courtship behavior. An example of the handicap principle may be the case of Guanlong, where the large, delicate crest may have been a hindrance to hunting in what was presumably an active predator. If an individual was healthy and successful at hunting despite the fragile crest, it would indicate the superior quality of the individual over others with smaller crests. Similarly to the unwieldy tail of a male peacock or the outsized antlers of an Irish elk, the crest of Guanlong may have evolved via sexual selection, providing an advantage in courtship that outweighed any decrease in hunting ability. =Reproduction= Neonate sized tyrannosaur fossils have been documented in the scientific literature.

In the vanguard of attempts from the 1960s to engage immigrant Caribbean communities within mainstream indigenous churches, it played a key role in opposing the National Front during the 1970s. By the 1980s and 1990s it achieved a 50%/50% balance of indigenous and non-indigenous membership and leadership, thereby contrasting sharply with a UK tendency towards majority-white and majority- black churches, where splits are typically in the 90/10 ratio. During the 1990s the church developed relationships with a number of black-led community groups which had grown out of the 1985 Handsworth riots (which also included Stechford), and from 2000 the church worked to support asylum-seeker rights. One of the church leaders, Mrs E C McGhie-Belgrave, was awarded the MBE in 2002 and subsequently the Queen's Golden Jubilee Award in 2004 for her contribution to community cohesion and Black-White issues in Birmingham. History Stechford Baptist Church preserves a complete set of written minutes from the date of its founding. A history of Stechford Baptist was commissioned by community organisation Shades of Black in 1998. The church was established in 1906, beginning meetings at the Council Schools and subsequently in the Masonic Hall. The present building, a Canadian timber frame and asbestos panel structure, was erected in 1926 on a larger plot of land acquired by the church. The timber frame structure was expected to last about ten years, to be replaced by a permanent brick structure. However, this work was never undertaken, and the additional land was sold for housing in the 1970s. For a long time the timber frame structure was known as 'Stechford Baptist Hall' , or Stechford church hall a reflection of the expectation of a permanent structure. Organisation In common with other British Baptist churches, Stechford Baptist is congregational in structure, with the Church Meeting of adult members electing the officers of the church at the Annual General Meeting. The calling of a pastor is also in the hands of the Church Meeting, although for more than half of its history the church has been lay- led. The church belongs to the Baptist Union of Great Britain, although there is no authority link between the union and the church, reflecting the position that the Baptist Union is an association with administrative functions rather than a denomination. Location The building is situated in Victoria Road, Stechford, inside the Albert Road ‚Äì Lyttelton Road ‚Äì Victoria Road triangle originally established by a building programme which accompanied the construction of the railway station in 1843. All of the existing church buildings within Stechford are within this triangle: Stechford Methodist (closed for services from 2005) is on Lyttelton Road, All Saints is on Albert Road, and Corpus Christi straddles Albert and Lyttelton Roads.

De Furnival was married to Maud, the great-granddaughter of William de Lovetot, and it was by this marriage that the lordships of Hallamshire and Worksop came into the Furnival family.

The Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, is the see church of the Episcopal Diocese of Alabama. On March 30, 1983, the structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Episcopal Church of the Advent. History The parish church of the Advent was established in 1872, one year after the founding of the city of Birmingham, and was one of the first churches built in the new city. The first building on this site was completed in 1873, but was destroyed by fire on November 24, 1892. The current structure was already underway at that date. It was designed by Wheelock, Joy, and Wheelock, was occupied in the fall of 1893, with the tower and portico undergoing construction until 1895. The cathedral is known for its prominent location on Twentieth Street North near Linn Park, as well as for the reputation of its music program. It was not until 1982 that the Church of the Advent became a cathedral, when the Diocese of Alabama selected the church as its seat. Today The congregation undertook a major project to preserve the Scioto sandstone exterior of the Cathedral between 1999 and 2005. During this same period the Rector's Garden was redesigned to improve drainage and accommodate a columbarium and the belltower was refitted for a carillon of fifteen bells, cast by Fonderie Paccard of Lac d'Annecy, France. In both 2005 and 2012, readers of the Birmingham News named the cathedral choir \\"Best Church Choir\\". Today, the Church of the Advent comprises nearly 4,000 members, making it one of the ten largest Episcopal churches in the United States. The current Dean of the Cathedral is the Very Reverend Andrew C. Pearson, Jr. The cathedral campus is also home to the Advent Episcopal Day School. Carpenter House, the headquarters building for the Diocese of Alabama, is connected to the cathedral building by a cloister.

It is a rare malignancy of plasmablastic cells that occurs in individuals that are infected with the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (i.e. KSHV/HHV8). Plamsmablasts are immature plasma cells, i.e. lymphocytes of the B-cell type that have differentiated into plasmablasts but because of their malignant nature do not differentiate into mature plasma cells but rather proliferate excessively and thereby cause life-threatening disease. In PEL, the proliferating plasmablastoid cells commonly accumulate within body cavities to produce effusions (i.e. accumulations of fluid), primarily in the pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal cavities, without forming a contiguous tumor mass. In rare cases of these cavitary forms of PEL, the effusions develop in joints, the epidural space surrounding the brain and spinal cord, and underneath the capsule (i.e. tightly-woven collagen fibers) which forms around breast implants. Less frequently, individuals present with extracavitary primary effusion lymphomas, i.e., solid tumor masses not accompanied by effusions. The extracavitary tumors may develop in lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, the gastrointestinal tract, skin, spleen, liver, lungs, central nervous system, testes, paranasal sinuses, muscle, and, rarely, inside the vasculature and sinuses of lymph nodes. As their disease progresses, however, individuals with the classical effusion-form of PEL may develop extracavitary tumors and individuals with extracavitary PEL may develop cavitary effusions. PEL typically occurs in individuals who are immunocompromised, i.e. individuals whose immune system is weakened and therefore less able to fight infectious agents and cancers. This weakening is ascribed to KSHV/HHV8 infection that is commonny further promoted by concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (i.e. HIV) infection, prior organ transplantation, the decline in immunity that develops with aging, and/or cirrhosis of the liver due to hepatitis B or C virus. The plasmacytoid cells in PEL are also commonly infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (i.e. EBV). EBV is a known cause of various Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases including various B-cell lymphomas. However, the role of this virus in the development of PEL is not clear, although some studies suggest that EBV infection cooperates with KSHV/HHV8 infection to promote the development and/or progression of this disease. Formally, PEL is defined by the World Health Organization, 2016 as a KSHV/HHV8-positive and KSHV/HHV8-driven large B-cell lymphoma. This lymphoma also belongs to a group of lymphoid neoplasms with plasmablastic differentiation that involve malignant plasmablasts but differ from PEL in the types of tissues where they accumulate, the gene abnormalities they carry, and/or the predisposing conditions involved in their development. More than 50, 30, and 60% of all PEL cases, respectively, develop in individuals who already have KSHV/HHV8-positive Karposi's sarcoma, human herpesvirus 8-associated multicentric Castleman disease, and/or (especially in HIV-positive individuals) evidence of bearing EBV-infected plasmsmablasts. Primary effussion lymphoma is an extremely aggressive cancer that is highly resistant to various chemotherapy treatments. It has carried a median survival time of ~5 months, with overall survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 year of only 30, 18, and 17%, respectively. In many cases, however, this high mortality reflects, at least in part, the lethality of its underlying predisposing diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS in HIV-infected individuals. New treatment strategies, including those directed at its underlying predisposing diseases, may improve the prognosis of PEL.  History  PEL was first described in 1989 as a malignant B cell-derived non-Hodgkin lymphoma that developed in three individuals afflicted with HIV/AIDS. In 1995, a group of researchers found DNA sequences that identified KSHV/HHV8 sequences in 8 lymphomas in the malignant cells of patients infected with the HIV; all 8 patients had effusions containing malignant cells in their pleural, pericardial, or peritoneal spaces and had malignant cells in their effusions that evidenced the Epstein-Barr viral genome. Nadir and colleagues termed this syndrome of findings pulmonary effusion lymphoma in 1996. During the years following these initial reports, several cases of PEL were found to be KSHV/HHV8-negative, i.e. occurring in individuals with no evidence of being infected with KSHV/HHV8, or to be manifested by solid tumors that were not associated with effusions, i.e. cases of extracavitary PEL.  Pathophysiology  PEL develops in patients that have predisposing diseases that reduce the immune systems ability to attack precancerous and cancerous cells. Initially, KSHV/HHV8 viruses infect plasmablasts to establish a latency state in which the viruses express malignancy-promoting genes (see KSHV/HHV8 genes). Products of these viral genes include: 1) LANA-1, which inhibits host cells' p53 protein thereby reducing these cells' apoptosis (i.e. programmed cell death) response to injury, and also inhibits the activity of host cells' retinoblastoma protein thereby increasing these cells' proliferation; 2) vcylin, an analog of host cell cyclin, which binds RB to increase these cells' proliferation; 3) vFLIP, which inhibits host cell's apoptosis and activates these cells' NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway to prolong their survival; 4) various protein isoforms of kaposin which stimulate host cells to release cytokines (e.g., GM-CSF and IL-6) that act back on these cells to stimulate their growth; 5) vIL6, a viral analog of host cells' IL-6 which, while not often expressed, induces these cells to produce VEGF, a cytokine that feeds back on these cells to inhibit their apoptosis and to increase the permeability of nearby blood vessels thereby promoting the formation of effusions; 6) K1 protein which promotes the malignancy of host cells; 7) G-protein coupled receptor protein which promotes host cells' proliferation and survival; and 8) several viral microRNAs that promote host cells to proliferate, inhibit these cells' apoptosis, and stimulate the vascularization of nearby small blood vessel to promote effusions. While HIV/AIDS is associated with a wide range of cancers, including those involving B-cells such as plasmablastic lymphoma, the development of these cancers is commonly attributed to co-infection with oncogenic viruses (e.g. KSHV/HHV8, EBV): the direct role of HIV/AIDS in promoting PEL is unclear. Finally, some studies suggest that EBV cooperates with KSHV/HHV8 to cause PEL, perhaps by enhancing the ability of KSHV/HHV8 to establish their pro-malignant latency phase in infected cells. As a probable result of their excessive proliferation, prolonged survival, and ability to avoid attack by a weakened immune system, the malignant cells in PEL exhibit a high degree of genomic instability, i.e. alterations in the structure and/or expression of their genetic material which are associated with the development and/or progression of PEL. These alterations include mutations (i.e. changes in nucleic acid sequences), chromosomal rearrangements (i.e. deletions, duplications, inversions, translocations), aneuploidy (i.e. increases or decreases in the number of chromosomes), and the abnormal expression of genes that may or may not be a result of the preceding structural gene changes. Potentially important examples include: 1) overexpression of the APOBEC3B gene whose protein product (termed \\"probable DNA dC->dU-editing enzyme APOBEC-3B\\") contributes to the regulation of cell growth; 2) missense mutations in the IRAK1 gene which causes overactivation of its product protein, interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, and thereby overactivation of the NF-Œ∫B signaling pathway that regulates cell proliferation and survival; 3) overexpression of the AQP3 gene whose protein product, aquaporin 3, is a water channel that when overexpressed is thought to promote the progression and spread of various types of cancers; 4) overexpression of the P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 gene whose protein product promotes cell attachment to vascular endothelium; 5) overexpressin of the MUC1 gene whose product, the Mucin 1, cell surface associated protein, binds with P53 to inhibit cell death and interacts with beta-catenin to promote the tissue-invasiveness of cancer cells; and 6) overexpression of the MYC gene, whose product, c-Myc, is the cancer-causing MYC proto-oncogene although this overexpression, unlike the c-Myc overexession occurring in other B-cell lymphomas, is usually not associated with structural abnormalities in its gene but rather is often overexpressed due to the action of the LANA-1 protein made by KSHV/HHV8. The identification of these changes in tissue samples can assist in making the diagnosis of PEL.  Presentation  Individuals diagnosed with PEL most commonly (>33% of all cases) present with advanced Stage III or IV disease. They are predominately males with a median age of 42 years if they are infected with HIV and 73 years if they are not so infected. Some one-third to one-half of these individuals have a history of Karposi's sarcoma, less commonly of multicentric Castleman disease, and/or rarely of immune deficiency due to organ transplantation, hepatitis complicated by cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B or C viral infection, or of old age. PEL occurring in the elderly generally occurs in EBV-negative individuals residing in the Mediterranean region. Individuals with the cavitary form of PEL present with symptoms due to effusions in the pleural cavity (e.g. shortness of breath), pericardium (e.g. chest pain/discomfort, hypotension, shortness of breath), peritoneal cavity (e.g. abdominal swelling), or, much less often, joints (e.g. swelling), the epidural space (e.g. central nervous system symptoms), or breast implants (e.g. breast swelling/pain/malformation). While most cases of classical PEL involve one cavitary site, some individuals present with two or more sites of cavitary involvement. Individuals with extracavitary PEL present with lesions in the lung, central nervous system, gastrointestinal tract, and/or lymph nodes. Gastrointestinal track lesions often occur as multiple lymphoid polyps in the large intestine. At diagnosis, more than 50% of individuals afflicted with either cavitary or extracavitary PEL have or report a history of B symptoms (i.e. fever, weight loss, night sweat). Laboratory examination in all PEL cases often show anemia, low blood levels of platelets, high serum levels of IL6, and high levels of circulating KSHV/HHV8.  Diagnosis  In classical cavitary cases, the diagnosis of PEL may be suspected based on its presentation as effusions in one or more bodily cavities in individuals with a history of the immunodeficiencies cited above. The diagnosis is supported by microscopic examination of cytologic smears taken from these effusions. These smears typically show plasmablasts and, in some cases, other malignant cells that have the morphology of anaplasts (i.e.large pleomorphic cells) or the Reed-Sternberg cells associated with Hodgkin disease. As detected by immunostaining methods, the malignant cells typically express molecular marker proteins such as CD45 (which is not expressed on mature plasma cells) as well as activation and plasma cell marker proteins such as CD30, MUC1, CD38, syndecan 1, and IRF4/MUM1; they do not express B-cell molecular marker proteins such as PAX5, CD19, CD29, or CD79a. The cells may also express many of the structural and non-structural gene abnormalities cited in the Pathophysiology section. By definition, individuals with PEL are infected by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV-8 or KSHV/HHV8) and therefore evidence malignant cells that express products of this virus such as LANA1. In most cases, these individuals are also infected with EBV and therefore evidence malignant cells that express products of this virus such as EBER1/2 nuclear RNA's. Cases associated with HIV/AIDS test positive for antibodies directed against this virus. (PEL occurs in the absence of HHV-8 and HIV, although this is rare.) Individuals with PEL that is associated with cirrosis due to hepatitis evidence positive serum tests for the hepatitis virus B antigen (HBsAg) or one of the various tests for hepatitis C antigen. Extracavitary PEL is diagnosed based on findings that their mass lesions contain the same or very similar types of malignant cells and the same set of blood and serum findings as those that are found in cavitary PEL.  KSHV/HHV8-negative primary effusion lymphoma  Effusion-based lymphoma, KSHV/HHV8-negative (also termed Type II PEL) has been described by some researchers. These cases closely resemble KSHV/HHV8-positive (also termed Type I PEL) but have yet to be defined by the World Health Organization (2017). Compared to Type I PEL, Type II PEL occurs more often in older individuals, is less often associated with EBV, and more often afflicts individuals who lack evidence of being immunocompromised. That is, the majority of HHV-8-negative EBL cases do not evidence a potentially PEL causative agent, such as HIV, EBV, HCV, or iatrogenic immunodeficiency, except for old age and, in 20% to 40% of cases, the presence of hepatitis C virus infection. Type II PEL also tends to involve malignant plasmablasts, anaplasts, and/or Reed-Sternberg-like cells that have somewhat different expression patters of protein markers (e.g. the malignant cells in Type II PEL frequently express CD20 but often do not express CD30) and gene abnormalities (e.g. the malignant cells in Type II PEL more commonly evidence rearrangements in their Myc, BCL2, and BCL6 genes) than the malignant cells in Type I PEL. The response to treatment and prognosis of Type II PEL is poor but may be somewhat better than the treatment- responsiveness and prognosis of Type I PEL. One factor that appears to improve the treatment of Type II PEL is the addition of rituximab (a monoclonal antibody directed against and killing CD20-bearing cell) to the intensive chemotherapy regimens used to treat Type I PEL: the malignant cells in Type II PEL commonly express CD20 whereas the malignant cells in Type I PEL rarely express this cell surface marker. However, there are several cases of KSHV/HHV8-negative EBL that presented with pericardial effusions without evidence of more extensive disease that have experienced complete responses and favorable prognoses without chemotherapy or other cancer treatment (including rituximab) after simple drainage of the effusion. These cases suggest that, in addition to the presence of rituximab-sensitive CD20-bearing malignant cells, Type II PEL may be a less severe disease than Type I PEL, at lease in certain cases. Treatment and prognosis  PEL is generally resistant to cancer chemotherapy drugs that are active against other B-cell lymphomas and therefore carries a poor prognosis. Overall median and 1 year survival rates in a series of 28 patients treated with chemotherapy for PEL were 6.2 months and 39.3%, respectively. In this study, the complete response rate (presumed to be temporary) to a standard CHOP chemotherapeutic regimen (i.e. cyclophosphamide doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) was only 10% whereas a more intensive CHO chemotherapy regimen which included high dose methotrexate and bleomycin achieved a compete response rate (presumed temporary) of 70%. A second study using CHOP-like regimens or one of these regimens plus methotrexate also produced better results with the latter regimens: 5 year survival rates for the CHOP-like and CHOP-like plus methotrexate regimens were 34.4% and 45.7%, respectively. A review of 105 PEL cases reported median survival times, 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year survival rates of 4.8 months, 30%, 18%, and 17%, respectively. In this study, patients with advanced Ann Arbor Stage III or IV disease had a particularly poor survival rate at 1 year of 25%; this compared to a rate of 42% for patients with stage I or II disease. Anti-viral drugs directed against Cytomegalovirus (i.e. cidofovir, ganciclovir, and valganciclovir) have been reported to produce complete presumed temporary responses in individual cases of PEL while drugs directed against HIV in patients with HIV+ PEL have achieved presumed temporary median response and 5 year survival rates of 0.7 months and 28%, respectively. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommends treating HIV/AIDS-related PEL with antiviral therapy in combination with aggressive chemotherapy regimens such as DA-EPOCH, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide, or CHOP. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against and killing CD20-expressing cells, appears to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy regimens in treating cases of PEL that evidence CD20-positve malignant cells such as Type II PEL. It has been suggested that regimens that include rituximab might improve the treatment of not only CD+ Type II PEL but also the uncommon cases of CD20+ Type I PEL and all cases of CD- PEL. The efficacy of rituximab in CD- PEL may be due to the ability of this antibody to kill non-malignant CD+ 20 lymphocytes and thereby their potential to promote the disease. A National Cancer Institute-sponsored clinical study is in its recruiting phase to study the efficacy of DA-EPOCH (which includes rituximab) plus lenalidomide in treating PEL.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02911142?term=rituximab&cond;=Primary+Effusion+Lymphoma&draw;=2&rank;=1 Current studies are also examining the effects of drug-based inhibition of the signaling pathways that are overactive in the malignant plasmablasts in PEL (see Pathophysiology section) for their therapeutic effectiveness.

History: Catholic The monastery was founded in 1085 by the Counts of R√ºck and T√ºbingen, against the background of the Investiture Controversy and the Hirsau Reforms. The first abbot, Adzelinus, and monks were from Hirsau Abbey. Abbot Fabri was closely involved with the foundation of the University of T√ºbingen in 1477. In 1493 the high altar was created. The choir stalls by J√∂rg Syrlin the younger are of a similar date. The Reformation saw the end of the Roman Catholic monastery, from which the monks were expelled in 1535, returning for a short time between 1549 and 1562. Reredos of the high altar (central detail), by Michael Erhart History: Protestant In 1563 the first Protestant abbot was appointed, and in 1565 a choir school was opened in the premises. During the Thirty Years' War the monks returned again in 1630 and yet again in 1648, but were expelled; the choir school closed in 1630 and reopened in 1650. It was finally shut down in 1807. A few years later in 1817 Blaubeuren became a Protestant seminary with an attached boarding school, which has remained to the present, except for a closure during World War II.

For example, the Brans‚ÄìDicke theory of gravitation uses both a scalar field and a tensor field to mediate the gravitational interaction.  Tensor fields and field theory  Modern physics tries to derive all physical theories from as few principles as possible. In this way, Newtonian mechanics as well as quantum mechanics are derived from Hamilton's principle of least action. In this approach, the behavior of a system is not described via forces, but by functions which describe the energy of the system. Most important are the energetic quantities known as the Hamiltonian function and the Lagrangian function. Their derivatives in space are known as Hamiltonian density and the Lagrangian density. Going to these quantities leads to the field theories. Modern physics uses field theories to explain reality. These fields can be scalar, vectorial or tensorial. An example of a scalar field is the temperature field. An example of a vector field is the wind velocity field. An example of a tensor field is the stress tensor field in a stressed body, used in continuum mechanics.  Gravity as field theory  In physics, forces (as vectorial quantities) are given as the derivative (gradient) of scalar quantities named potentials. In classical physics before Einstein, gravitation was given in the same way, as consequence of a gravitational force (vectorial), given through a scalar potential field, dependent of the mass of the particles. Thus, Newtonian gravity is called a scalar theory. The gravitational force is dependent of the distance r of the massive objects to each other (more exactly, their centre of mass). Mass is a parameter and space and time are unchangeable. Einstein's theory of gravity, the General Relativity (GR) is of another nature. It unifies space and time in a 4-dimensional manifold called space-time. In GR there is no gravitational force, instead, the actions we ascribed to being a force are the consequence of the local curvature of space-time. That curvature is defined mathematically by the so-called metric, which is a function of the total energy, including mass, in the area. The derivative of the metric is a function that approximates the classical Newtonian force in most cases. The metric is a tensorial quantity of degree 2 (it can be given as a 4x4 matrix, an object carrying 2 indices). Another possibility to explain gravitation in this context is by using both tensor (of degree n>1) and scalar fields, i.e. so that gravitation is given neither solely through a scalar field nor solely through a metric. These are scalar‚Äìtensor theories of gravitation. The field theoretical start of General Relativity is given through the Lagrange density. It is a scalar and gauge invariant (look at gauge theories) quantity dependent on the curvature scalar R. This Lagrangian, following Hamilton's principle, leads to the field equations of Hilbert and Einstein. If in the Lagrangian the curvature (or a quantity related to it) is multiplied with a square scalar field, field theories of scalar‚Äìtensor theories of gravitation are obtained. In them, the gravitational constant of Newton is no longer a real constant but a quantity dependent of the scalar field. =Mathematical formulation= An action of such a gravitational scalar‚Äìtensor theory can be written as follows: : S = \\\\frac{1}{c} \\\\int {d^4 x \\\\sqrt{-g} \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\mu}} \\\\times \\\\left[ \\\\Phi R-\\\\frac{\\\\omega(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi} (\\\\partial_\\\\sigma \\\\Phi)^2-V(\\\\Phi)+ 2 \\\\mu~\\\\mathcal{L}_m (g_{\\\\mu u}, \\\\Psi) \\\\right], where g is the metric determinant, R is the Ricci scalar constructed from the metric g_{\\\\mu u}, \\\\mu is a coupling constant with the dimensions L^{-1} M^{-1}T^2, V(\\\\Phi) is the scalar-field potential, \\\\mathcal{L}_m is the material Lagrangian and \\\\Psi represents the non-gravitational fields. Here, the Brans‚ÄìDicke parameter \\\\omega has been generalized to a function. Although \\\\mu is often written as being 8 \\\\pi G / c^4, one has to keep in mind that the fundamental constant G there, is not the constant of gravitation that can be measured with, for instance, Cavendish type experiments. Indeed, the empirical gravitational constant is generally no longer a constant in scalar‚Äìtensor theories, but a function of the scalar field \\\\Phi. The metric and scalar-field equations respectively write: :R_{\\\\mu u}-\\\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\\\mu u}R= \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\Phi}T_{\\\\mu u}+ \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Phi} [ abla_\\\\mu abla_ u -g_{\\\\mu u}\\\\Box]\\\\Phi +\\\\frac{\\\\omega(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi^2}(\\\\partial_\\\\mu \\\\Phi \\\\partial_ u \\\\Phi \\\\- \\\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\\\mu u}(\\\\partial_\\\\alpha \\\\Phi)^2)-g_{\\\\mu u} \\\\frac{V(\\\\Phi)}{2 \\\\Phi} , and :\\\\frac{2\\\\omega(\\\\Phi)+3}{\\\\Phi}\\\\Box \\\\Phi= \\\\frac{\\\\mu}{\\\\Phi} T - \\\\frac{\\\\omega'(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi} (\\\\partial_\\\\sigma \\\\Phi)^2 + V'(\\\\Phi) - 2 \\\\frac{V(\\\\Phi)}{\\\\Phi} . Also, the theory satisfies the following conservation equation, implying that test-particles follow space-time geodesics such as in general relativity: : abla_\\\\sigma T^{\\\\mu \\\\sigma} = 0, where T^{\\\\mu \\\\sigma} is the stress-energy tensor defined as :T_{\\\\mu u}=-\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{-g}} \\\\frac{\\\\delta(\\\\sqrt{-g}\\\\mathcal{L}_m)}{\\\\delta g^{\\\\mu u}}. The Newtonian approximation of the theory Developing perturbatively the theory defined by the previous action around a Minkowskian background, and assuming non-relativistic gravitational sources, the first order gives the Newtonian approximation of the theory. In this approximation, and for a theory without potential, the metric writes :g_{00}=-1+ 2 \\\\frac{U}{c^2}+\\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-3}),~ g_{0i}=\\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-2}),~ g_{ij}=\\\\delta_{ij}+\\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}), with U satisfying the following usual Poisson equation at the lowest order of the approximation: :\\\\triangle U = 8 \\\\pi G_\\\\mathrm{eff}~ \\\\rho+\\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}), where \\\\rho is the density of the gravitational source and G_\\\\mathrm{eff}= \\\\frac{2 \\\\omega_0 +4}{2 \\\\omega_0 +3} \\\\frac{G}{\\\\Phi_0} (the subscript _0 indicates that the corresponding value is taken at present cosmological time and location). Therefore, the empirical gravitational constant is a function of the present value of the scalar-field background \\\\Phi_0 and therefore theoretically depends on time and location. However, no deviation from the constancy of the Newtonian gravitational constant has been measured, implying that the scalar-field background \\\\Phi_0 is pretty stable over time. Such a stability is not theoretically generally expected but can be theoretically explained by several mechanisms. The first post-Newtonian approximation of the theory Developing the theory at the next level leads to the so-called first post-Newtonian order. For a theory without potential and in a system of coordinates respecting the weak isotropy condition (i.e., g_{ij} \\\\propto \\\\delta_{ij}+\\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-3})), the metric takes the following form: :g_{00}=-1+\\\\frac{2 W}{c^2} - \\\\beta \\\\frac{2 W^2}{c^4}+\\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-5}) :g_{0i}=-(\\\\gamma+1) \\\\frac{2W_i}{c^3}+\\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-4}) :g_{ij}=\\\\delta_{ij} \\\\left(1+\\\\gamma \\\\frac{2 W}{c^2} \\\\right)+\\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-3}) with : \\\\Box W+\\\\frac{1+2\\\\beta -3\\\\gamma }{c^2} W\\\\triangle W+\\\\frac{2}{c^2}( 1+\\\\gamma) \\\\partial_t J =-4\\\\pi G_\\\\mathrm{eff}\\\\Sigma+ \\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-3}) , :\\\\triangle W_i-\\\\partial x_i J =-4\\\\pi G_\\\\mathrm{eff}\\\\Sigma^i + \\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}), where J is a function depending on the coordinate gauge :J =\\\\partial_t W+\\\\partial_k W_k+\\\\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}). It corresponds to the remaining diffeomorphism degree of freedom that is not fixed by the weak isotropy condition. The sources are defined as :\\\\Sigma =\\\\frac{1}{c^2} (T^{00}+\\\\gamma T^{kk}), ~~~\\\\Sigma^i =\\\\frac{1}{c} T^{0i}, the so-called post-Newtonian parameters are :\\\\gamma = \\\\frac{\\\\omega_0 +1}{\\\\omega_0 +2}, ~~\\\\beta = 1+\\\\frac{\\\\omega_0^{\\\\prime}}{( 2\\\\omega_0 +3) (2\\\\omega_0+4)^2}, and finally the empirical gravitational constant G_\\\\mathrm{eff} is given by :G_\\\\mathrm{eff}= \\\\frac{2\\\\omega_0+4}{2\\\\omega_0+3}G, where G is the (true) constant that appears in the coupling constant \\\\mu defined previously.  Observational constraints on the theory  Current observations indicate that \\\\gamma-1=(2.1 \\\\pm 2.3)\\\\times 10^{-5}, which means that \\\\omega_0 > 40 000. Although explaining such a value in the context of the original Brans‚ÄìDicke theory is impossible, Damour and Nordtvedt found that the field equations of the general theory often lead to an evolution of the function \\\\omega toward infinity during the evolution of the universe. Hence, according to them, the current high value of the function \\\\omega could be a simple consequence of the evolution of the universe. The best current constraint on the post-Newtonian parameter \\\\beta comes from Mercury's perihelion shift and is \\\\beta-1<3 \\\\times 10^{-3}. Both constraints show that while the theory is still a potential candidate to replace general relativity, the scalar field must be very weakly coupled in order to explain current observations. Generalized scalar-tensor theories have also been proposed as explanation for the accelerated expansion of the universe but the measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event GW170817 has ruled this out.  Higher-dimensional relativity and scalar‚Äìtensor theories  After the postulation of the General Relativity of Einstein and Hilbert, Theodor Kaluza and Oskar Klein proposed in 1917 a generalization in a 5-dimensional manifold: Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theory. This theory possesses a 5-dimensional metric (with a compactified and constant 5th metric component, dependent on the gauge potential) and unifies gravitation and electromagnetism, i.e. there is a geometrization of electrodynamics. This theory was modified in 1955 by P. Jordan in his Projective Relativity theory, in which, following group-theoretical reasonings, Jordan took a functional 5th metric component that led to a variable gravitational constant G. In his original work, he introduced coupling parameters of the scalar field, to change energy conservation as well, according to the ideas of Dirac. Following the Conform Equivalence theory, multidimensional theories of gravity are conform equivalent to theories of usual General Relativity in 4 dimensions with an additional scalar field. One case of this is given by Jordan's theory, which, without breaking energy conservation (as it should be valid, following from microwave background radiation being of a black body), is equivalent to the theory of C. Brans and Robert H. Dicke of 1961, so that it is usually spoken about the Brans‚ÄìDicke theory. The Brans‚ÄìDicke theory follows the idea of modifying Hilbert-Einstein theory to be compatible with Mach's principle. For this, Newton's gravitational constant had to be variable, dependent of the mass distribution in the universe, as a function of a scalar variable, coupled as a field in the Lagrangian. It uses a scalar field of infinite length scale (i.e. long-ranged), so, in the language of Yukawa's theory of nuclear physics, this scalar field is a massless field. This theory becomes Einsteinian for high values for the parameter of the scalar field. In 1979, R. Wagoner proposed a generalization of scalar‚Äìtensor theories using more than one scalar field coupled to the scalar curvature. JBD theories although not changing the geodesic equation for test particles, change the motion of composite bodies to a more complex one. The coupling of a universal scalar field directly to the gravitational field gives rise to potentially observable effects for the motion of matter configurations to which gravitational energy contributes significantly. This is known as the \\"Dicke‚ÄìNordtvedt\\" effect, which leads to possible violations of the Strong as well as the Weak Equivalence Principle for extended masses. JBD-type theories with short-ranged scalar fields use, according to Yukawa's theory, massive scalar fields. The first of this theories was proposed by A. Zee in 1979. He proposed a Broken-Symmetric Theory of Gravitation, combining the idea of Brans and Dicke with the one of Symmetry Breakdown, which is essential within the Standard Model SM of elementary particles, where the so-called Symmetry Breakdown leads to mass generation (as a consequence of particles interacting with the Higgs field). Zee proposed the Higgs field of SM as scalar field and so the Higgs field to generate the gravitational constant. The interaction of the Higgs field with the particles that achieve mass through it is short-ranged (i.e. of Yukawa-type) and gravitational-like (one can get a Poisson equation from it), even within SM, so that Zee's idea was taken 1992 for a scalar‚Äìtensor theory with Higgs field as scalar field with Higgs mechanism. There, the massive scalar field couples to the masses, which are at the same time the source of the scalar Higgs field, which generates the mass of the elementary particles through Symmetry Breakdown. For vanishing scalar field, this theories usually go through to standard General Relativity and because of the nature of the massive field, it is possible for such theories that the parameter of the scalar field (the coupling constant) does not have to be as high as in standard JBD theories. Though, it is not clear yet which of these models explains better the phenomenology found in nature nor if such scalar fields are really given or necessary in nature. Nevertheless, JBD theories are used to explain inflation (for massless scalar fields then it is spoken of the inflaton field) after the Big Bang as well as the quintessence. Further, they are an option to explain dynamics usually given through the standard cold dark matter models, as well as MOND, Axions (from Breaking of a Symmetry, too), MACHOS,...  Connection to string theory  A generic prediction of all string theory models is that the spin-2 graviton has a spin-0 partner called the dilaton. Hence, string theory predicts that the actual theory of gravity is a scalar‚Äìtensor theory rather than general relativity. However, the precise form of such a theory is not currently known because one does not have the mathematical tools in order to address the corresponding non-perturbative calculations. Besides, the precise effective 4-dimensional form of the theory is also confronted to the so-called landscape issue.

It is the administrative center of the Zalishchyky Raion (district). Alternative or historical translations include ; ; ; ; ; Zalishchiki. Etymology Zalishchyky's name, as well as its precursors Zalissia and Zalishche, derive from the Ukrainian word for the witch-hazel shrub (). The name is attributed to Zalishchyky's initial settlers. A common myth is that the name originated from \\"zalis\\", a compound of the Ukrainian words \\"–∑–∞\\" (za) and \\"–ª—ñ—Å\\" (lic), together meaning \\"behind (the) forest\\". Though, Hinterwalden, the name for a Saxon settlement on Zalishchyky, does indeed find its etymological roots in this idea, originating from the German \\"hinterwald\\" (also meaning, literally, \\"behind forest\\").  Geography  Zalishchyky is located at the southern edge of Ternopil Oblast near a place where three oblasts (Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Chernivtsi) joint together. Geographically the city is located on border of west Podolia, Bucovina, and east Galicia, in valley of Dniester which forms in this area so called Dniester canyon. Through the city passes important European route E85 which connects Baltic coast with the coast of Aegean Sea in northern Greece. Zalishchyky's climate is quite mild, with grapes, peaches and other fruits growing in the area. It is especially famous for its tomatoes. Since the inter-war era, it has been a centre for the tourist industry. Before the collapse of the USSR, some 10,000 visitors arrived annually. In the antebellum period, the town was an important tourist center of Poland. It is also one of the few wine growing areas in that part of Ukraine.

The 'original' Zalishchyky was actually founded in the area just outside of the modern town's borders, on the land that is now the Ukrainian village of Dobrivlyany (which existed as a subdivision of the modern city between 1981-1986). In 1469, this village was a peasant farming community under the name Zalissia (–ó–∞–ª—ñ—Å—Å—è) and later Zalishche (–ó–∞–ª—ñ—Å—â–µ) in the 15th century. In 1569, Zalishchyky was assigned to the Podolian Voivodship, an administrative unit of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth, to which the town became a seat for their county in 1774. In 1578, the village officially adopted the name \\"Zalishchyky\\". In 1594, Stanis≈Çaw ≈ª√≥≈Çkiewski raised an army in Zalishchyky and defended the locale from a Tartar invasion.Sergei Lep'yavko.

In 1669, the village was completely destroyed by Turk invaders, and the survivors were almost wiped out under the rule of the sultan Mehmed IV during the better part of the Second Polish‚ÄìOttoman War. In 1750, at the invitation of Prince Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski, Saxon weavers of Silesian cloth settled on part of an historically older portion of Zalishchyky, and named it Hinterw√§lden. The establishment marked Zalishchyky's transition from a village to a true town. Hinterw√§lden still survives today, and is now known as \\"Old Zalishchyky\\". In 1766, Zalishchyky received the right to self-governance under the Magdeburg Law. The new town's seal read, Sigillum civitatis (Za)leszczyki. The 1772 census lists 159 Jewish families of varying professions dwelling in Zalishchyky. Between 1772 and 1918 Zalishchyky was ruled by the Austrian states of the Habsburg Monarchy, Austrian Empire, and finally Austria-Hungary, though between 1809‚Äì1816 it was under control of the Russian Empire. During the 19th century, the area around Zalishchyky was populated primarily by Ukrainian country folk, though the town had a large Polish and Jewish population. By then, the city was associated with the best peaches, plums and grapes in the Austrian Empire. On 18 June 1809 during the War of the Fifth Coalition the town was the site of a fierce battle () that ended with an Austrian victory. In 1838, the commander of Zalishchyky's infantry battalion reported the beginnings of a peasant revolt against the didych (), the land owners.–í–µ—Ä–∏–≥–∞ –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å –Ü–≤–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á. –ù–∞—Ä–∏—Å–∏ –∑ —ñ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä—ñ—ó –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ (–∫—ñ–Ω–µ—Ü—å XVIII ‚Äî –ø–æ—á–∞—Ç–æ–∫ –•–Ü–• —Å—Ç.). ‚Äî –õ—å–≤—ñ–≤ : –°–≤—ñ—Ç, 1996. ‚Äî 448 —Å. ‚Äî –°. 144. ‚Äî . No battles or skirmishes actually occurred during this \\"revolt\\", instead peasants went on strike and lodged complaints to the district council from the government. The Austrian government took many measures to suppress the peasant discontent, and finally in July 1838 evacuated the district administration and started a riot in Zalishchyky, all the while torturing innocent civilians. In 1863, the town's Christians rioted against the Jewish population after a Jewish business owner attempted to collect on a loan to a Christian storekeeper. In the ensuing chaos, Jews were beaten and Jewish property was destroyed before police from Chernivtsi were able to suppress the incident. Later that same year a Jewish family was butchered in a nearby hamlet. Zalishchyky's synagogue was destroyed in 1871 by a massive fire that also razed 170 houses. At the end of the 19th century, the area around Zalishchyky witnessed large-scale emigration to the New World, especially western Canada. Austrian stamp cancelled Zaleszczyki in 1876 In 1914, Russia captured Zalishchyky, initially killing 30 Jews, before expelling the rest of the town's Jews on 15 April of the following year, many of whom died of typhus and syphilis. Following the end of the First World War in 1917, the town's economy was bilious and many Jews were either widowed or orphaned by the war. The town recovered from its wartime loses thanks to aid from the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and Jews from neighboring towns and oblasts. After the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, Zalishchyky was annexed along with the majority of East Galicia by the short-lived West Ukrainian People's Republic, following which Yevhen Petrushevych was appointed as the town dictator. After the subsequent Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War ended in Polish victory, and the total looting of Zalishchyky, the town was again under Polish sovereignty. Zalishchyky became part of the Tarnopol Voivodeship. Under the Second Polish Republic, Zalishchyky was located in the extreme southeast corner of the country, and developed into a very popular spa, and was dubbed the \\"Polish Meran\\" or the \\"Polish Riviera\\", especially popular were the sandy beaches located along the Dniester. The town was regarded as the warmest town in Poland and the Polish capital of grapevine, with annual grape festivals taking place here every summer. Zalishchyky had a direct rail connection with Warsaw and Gdynia (the distance of , the longest route in the Second Polish Republic). Furthermore, a luxtorpeda fast train connected Zalishchyky with Ternopil. The town suffered three catastrophic floods in 1863, 1871, and 1927. Crossing the border at Zalishchyky into Romania on 15 September 1939, 2 days before the Soviet invasion from the east - passport. Zalishchyky's already prolific reputation in the world of tourism coupled with the luxtorpeda railways revived Zalishchyky's tourist industry, and the town's economy boomed as it slowly became completely oriented to tourist activity. This bloom lasted until 1939 when Germany commenced the Invasion of Poland, igniting World War II and leading Soviet Ukraine, a constituent republic of the Soviet Union, to annex Zalishchyky on 17 September, during the Polish September Campaign. After Soviet capture and occupation of Zalishchyky, the beaches and orchards were destroyed, the Baroque town hall was demolished, and a monument of Lenin was erected in its spot. The Roman Catholic church of St. Stanislaus was devastated, and turned into fertilizer storage. All Jewish activity ceased, with the exception of some continuing education in Yiddish schools. Following the onset of the war, many officials from the Polish government and military travelled through Zalishchyky en route to Romania, whose borders still remain within a considerably short distance from the modern town. In early July 1941, on a date not certainly known, the Soviets drowned close to a thousand civilians in the Dniester in what became the Zalishchyky tragedy. On 8 July 1941, German forces entered Zalishchyky and immediately began persecuting the town's Jews ‚Äì more than 3,700 civilians from Zalishchyky and the surrounding locales were murdered. Many were sent to be slave labor in Nazi-controlled Zhvanets in the fall. On 14 November, several Jews were deported to work camps, 200 to Kamianka-Buzka, and 40 to numerous smaller locales, such as Kutno. Shortly after, 800 Jews were forced to the outskirts of Zalishchyky, where they were murdered. In 2011, a monument was erected near the execution site (now a sports stadium). The proper site of the execution was developed with residential houses and garages after the end of the Second World War. Much of the town died of hunger and typhoid in the winter of 1941, and Jews were moved to neighboring ghettos, mainly to T≈Çuste, beginning 20 September 1942. From T≈Çuste, most of them were shipped to Be≈Ç≈ºec extermination camp, others died during deportations. Only a few dozen survived. Some were able to escape to areas such as Tashkent thanks to Soviet evacuations and deportations during the war. In March 1944, the region was liberated by the Russians, before briefly returning to German control, during which many Jews were murdered by the panicking Nazis. After being liberated a second time by the 1st Ukrainian Front on 24 March, survivors and some of those deported returned to Zalishchyky. While the Nazi forces had been defeated, conditions hardly improved. While Moscow lauded the liberation of the city, even naming a battle division after the city, Communist control soon proved to be worse than Nazi occupation in many ways. Starting less than a day after liberation, denizens of Zalishchyky were arrested by SMERSH and presumably murdered by operatives of the NKVD. In October, more than 800 citizens from Zalishchyky were forcibly drafted by the Soviets to so called penal military units (, Shtrafbaty) to fight in the Baltic Offensive, less than 20 survived. After the war, the town was largely repaired, as industrial plants, buildings, and roads were rebuilt and recommissioned. In addition, canneries were widely re-established, leading to the opening of bakeries, dairy plants, corn-calibrating plants, as well as factories which produced textiles and other consumer goods. Quite a few of these industries lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union, after which they collapsed following the Ukraine's transition from the Soviet planned economy. Nonetheless, the city's economy continues to be concentrated on light industry, particularly the agrarian sector. In 2016, Zalishchyky celebrated the 250th anniversary of township under the Magdeburg Law with a holiday commemorating the city. A two-day long \\"Zalishchyky Fest\\" ensued. Concurrently, Zalishchyky's government has begun work on repairing infrastructure, such as asphalt repair, paved lighting, new lights, benches, litter bins, and a number of improvements to either of the city's local parks; one of which, the Zalishchyky Central Park, houses a number of historic monuments and rare species of flora. This park and Zalishchyky Park which lies to the south are a Ukrainian national park.  Archeology and monuments  Before the Second World War, the area around Zalishchyky became a major centre of archeological attention. Near various villages, especially Koshylivtsi (), a little north of the Dniester, excavations were carried out which uncovered statues, coins, and other artifacts from as far back as the Neolithic Cucuteni-Trypillian culture, and extending through the period of the Roman Empire and the Migration Period in the Early Middle Ages. Zalishchyky contains a 17th-century Roman Catholic church, an 18th-century Town Hall and other monuments.

This process adds an element of sculpture to origami, which is otherwise purely geometric. Wet-folding is used very often by professional folders for non-geometric origami, such as animals. Wet-folders usually employ thicker paper than what would usually be used for normal origami, to ensure that the paper does not tear. One of the most prominent users of the wet- folding technique is √âric Joisel, who specialized in origami animals, humans, and legendary creatures. He also created origami masks. Other folders who practice this technique are Robert J. Lang and John Montroll. The process of wet-folding allows a folder to preserve a curved shape more easily. It also reduces the number of wrinkles substantially. Wet-folding allows for increased rigidity and structure due to a process called sizing. Sizing is a water- soluble adhesive, usually methylcellulose or methyl acetate, that may be added during the manufacture of the paper. As the paper dries, the chemical bonds of the fibers of the paper tighten together which results in a crisper and stronger sheet. In order to moisten the paper, an artist typically wipes the sheet with a dampened cloth. The amount of moisture added to the paper is crucial because too little will cause the paper to dry quickly and spring back into its original position before the folding is complete, while too much will either fray the edges of the paper or will cause the paper to split at high- stress points.

It is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock.Placenames Database of Ireland - Kilbarrack civil parish Modern-day Kilbarrack is within the jurisdiction of Dublin City Council, with part of its old lands now in Donaghmede, and part in Bayside under Fingal County Council jurisdiction. Location and access Kilbarrack railway stationKilbarrack is situated on the Northside of the city, between the suburbs of Raheny, Donaghmede and Bayside (the latter was formed from Kilbarrack's old core). It originally bordered Sutton, Dublin also, and the coastal part may still do so. Its coastal area faces North Bull Island across the water known as Raheny Lake or Crab Water. Kilbarrack is accessible from the coast road and the Tonlegee Road, by its own station on the (DART) Dublin Area Rapid Transit suburban rail system (as well as from Raheny and Howth Junction stations), and by bus routes 17A to Blanchardstown, 31/A/B to Howth and the city centre and 32, from the city centre to Malahide and Portmarnock. It is around from the M1 and M50 motorways and 7 km from Dublin Airport. Kilbarrack railway station opened on 1 June 1969. History and nature Kilbarrack and neighbouring districts,1901 - since then, parts have been taken into the new districts of Donaghmede and Bayside Kilbarrack is an old district, whose name can be found on maps and sea charts, many held at Dublin City Archive, going back several hundred years. It was historically a large area of fields, many being 'grange' lands held by Dublin church establishments, with small settlements. Over time, two hamlets emerged, Kilbarrack proper, near the seafront, close to the still-extant Kilbarrack Church and Graveyard complex (illustrated below), and Little Kilbarrack, on the road inland (now Tonlegee Road). The district is crossed by one of Dublin's small waterways, the Kilbarrack Stream or Donough Water, which enters the sea in two branches. Old Kilbarrack Church (Mariners Church, Chapel of Mone) and graveyard, beside the original Kilbarrack village, now Bayside The coastal church (\\"mapped as Kilbarrack Church, in ruins\\") and surrounding graveyard were a point of call for mariners, and the church is noted in some records as the Chapel of Mone. At one time, ships entering Dublin Bay paid monies to the city authorities towards the upkeep of the chapel. The cemetery, which still accepts burials in existing graves, includes the grave of the \\"Sham Squire.\\" The site of Kilbarrack hamlet, and the part of the district bounding Sutton and Baldoyle, are now together known as Bayside (from inside Kilbarrack Road to Baldoyle Road), while today's Kilbarrack, and the Greendale shopping and civic complex, are close to where Little Kilbarrack stood. The Tesco-led shopping centre is near the site of the former \\"big house\\" of the area, Kilbarrack House. In the 1970s, Swans Nest Court, a complex of tower blocks of flats was built by Dublin Corporation. It was demolished and redeveloped into social and affordable housing in the early 2000s after it fell into disrepair. Amenities Kilbarrack has a local office of Dublin City Council, two shopping precincts (Greendale, with a large Centra, and Kilbarrack, dominated by Tesco, which has renovated it twice over the last decade) and a range of shops and pubs. There is a major Health Services Executive centre, and, at the boundary with Raheny and Donaghmede, and a municipal fire station and practice yard. Kilbarrack has five primary schools, three in one grouping: Scoil Eoin, the Educate Together North Bay School and Gaelscoil Mide, previously of Donaghmede, and two in another group: St. Benedict's and St. Mary's, located beside St. Benedict's parish church. Kilbarrack is also well known for its sporting clubs and teams, which include Bay City Boxing Club, Naomh Barrog GAA Club (https://web.archive.org/web/20120313202639/http://www.naomhbarrog.ie/), Kilbarrack United FC (http://www.kilbarrackunited.com), who play intermediate football in the Leinster Senior League (LSL) after previously being in Premier A of the AUL, and Kilmount Boys FC who were Amateur Football League champions 2007-8.

Single Crossing Condition in Probability  In economics, the single-crossing condition or single-crossing property refers to how the probability distribution of outcomes changes as a function of an input and a parameter. Cumulative distribution functions F and G satisfy the single-crossing condition if there exists a y^* such that \\\\forall x, x \\\\ge y^* \\\\implies F(x) \\\\ge G(x) and \\\\forall x, x \\\\le y^* \\\\implies F(x) \\\\le G(x); that is, function h(x) = F(x)-G(x) crosses the x-axis at most once, in which case it does so from below. This property can be extended to two or more variables. Given x and t, for all x'>x, t'>t, F(x',t) \\\\ge F(x,t) \\\\implies F(x',t') \\\\ge F(x,t') and F(x',t) > F(x,t) \\\\implies F(x',t') > F(x,t'). This condition could be interpreted as saying that for x'>x, the function g(t)=F(x',t)-F(x,t) crosses the horizontal axis at most once, and from below. The condition is not symmetric in the variables (i.e., we cannot switch x and t in the definition; the necessary inequality in the first argument is weak, while the inequality in the second argument is strict). The single-crossing condition was posited in Samuel Karlin's 1968 monograph 'Total Positivity'. It was later used by Peter Diamond, Joseph Stiglitz, and Susan Athey,Athey, Susan, 2001. \\"Single Crossing Properties and the Existence of Pure Strategy Equilibria in Games of Incomplete Information,\\" Econometrica, Econometric Society, vol. 69(4), pages 861-89, July. in studying the economics of uncertainty. The single-crossing condition is also used in applications where there are a few agents or types of agents that have preferences over an ordered set. Such situations appear often in information economics, contract theory, social choice and political economics, among other fields.  Single Crossing Condition in Mechanism Design  The term Single-Crossing Condition (Spence Mirrlees property) refers to the requirement that the isoutility curve for agents of different types cross only once. This condition guarantees that the transfer in an incentive- compatible direct mechanism can be pinned down by the transfer of the lowest type. This condition is similar to another condition called Strict Increasing Difference (SID). Formally, suppose the agent has a utility function V(q,\\\\theta), the SID says \\\\forall q_2>q_1,\\\\theta_2>\\\\theta_1 we have V(q_2,\\\\theta_2)-V(q_1,\\\\theta_2)>V(q_2,\\\\theta_1)-V(q_1,\\\\theta_1).

It was released in the US (Hickory LPM 135 (monaural) /LPS 135 (stereo)) in September 1966. History When Donovan signed a contract with Epic Records, he became entangled in a legal dispute with Pye Records over the rights to his music. These legal proceedings withheld any new Donovan releases in the United Kingdom until late 1966. In the meantime, Pye Records' United States distributor Hickory Records compiled The Real Donovan from Donovan's Pye Records releases, choosing several songs that had not yet appeared on any United States release. The Real Donovan was released within the same month as Donovan's first Epic Records album Sunshine Superman. Both albums were intended to capitalize on the success of the \\"Sunshine Superman\\" single, which hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts in the United States.

Charles C. Ragin defines it as one of the four building blocks of social research (the other three being ideas (social theories), evidence (data) and images (new ideas synthetised from existing data). Thus, analytic frames are used to elaborate on starting ideas and usually consist of a list of some key elements found in most of the analysed phenomena (for example, social movements). Two specific types of analytic frames are case and aspect based frames. Framing by case refers to researchers using concepts to classify the phenomena they study, while framing by aspect refers to using concepts to characterize the phenomena. For example, a scientists describing a restaurant, a bus, a coffeehouse and a waiting room as a noninteraction places is assigning them into the same category, thus framing them by case. Framing by aspect is going further and differentiating between cases in a given category (how exactly is noninteraction achieved in those places, what forms of social interaction are permitted in those places, etc.). Frames can be also divided into fixed, fluid, or flexible. Fixed frames don't change in later research states. They are common in quantitative research, and are used to test and prove or falsify a hypothesis. Flexible frames are common in comparative research, where they show which factors may be more relevant in specific research context, helping to explore the problem without making specific hypothesis. Fluid frames are used when researcher wants to limit the influence of the existing, more established theories; they are thus subject to much change and the researcher can use several frames switching between them depending on the gathered data. Fluid frames are most common in the qualitative research. References * Charles C.

Ministry Evans was born in Sydney, Australia. He graduated from the University of Sydney, majoring in philosophy and modern history. Coming from a religious family, Evans trained to become a Methodist minister and was ordained by the New South Wales Conference in 1967. He served as a circuit minister until his retirement in 1998. He is the author of a number of books on the history of evangelism.Who is Rev. Robert Evans? Supernova search Evans took up supernova hunting around 1955, but his first adequate instrument, a 10-inch (25 cm) Newtonian telescope was assembled only about 1968. He made his first official supernova discovery in 1981 and found nine more before using larger telescopes. While living in Coonabarabran, New South Wales he used his own 16 inch (40 cm) telescope. From early 1995 to mid-1997 he also had limited access to the Siding Spring Telescope at Siding Spring Observatory (he was allocated about 110 nights, half of which were suitable for observing), resulting in about 10,000 galaxy observations, another three visual supernovae discoveries and an additional four supernovae spotted on photographs made at the observatory.Jeremy Tatum, Notes - Honorary RASC Member Robert Evans, R.A.S. Canada. Journal, vol. 89, n. 2, aprile 1995, pag. 64-65-66 By 2001, he had made 33 visual discoveries and by the end of 2005, despite the increasing competition from automated telescopes, the total number had already increased to 40 visual supernova discoveries plus one comet. In 2005, Evans relied almost exclusively on his 31 cm Dobsonian. He reported 6,814 galaxy observations in a period of 107 hours and 30 minutes, spread out over 77 nights. During that time, he found four supernovae; three had already been discovered by others, the fourth was SN 2005df, which was Evan's third supernova discovery in NGC 1559 (after SN 1984J and SN 1986L) and his 40th visual discovery. In his book An Anthropologist on Mars, Oliver Sacks described Evans' memory as eidetic or savantlike: he has memorized the starfield foregrounds and positions of around 1500 galaxies and can detect changes simply by looking at them through his telescope. In an interview, Evans reported that he was able \\"to observe 50 galaxies an hour when they were scattered around the sky, and 120 galaxies an hour in Virgo\\".Interview of Robert Evans accessed 7 November 2010 Only in the 1990s did automated telescopes come into use which offered a comparable speed - like the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope. Evans also features prominently in Bill Bryson's A Short History of Nearly Everything which quotes him as saying \\"There's something satisfying, I think, about the idea of light travelling for millions of years through space and just at the right moment as it reaches Earth someone looks at the right bit of sky and sees it. It just seems right that an event of that magnitude should be witnessed.\\"A Short History of Nearly Everything, page 32, First Edition, Doubleday, 2003 Supernova 1983N, spotted by Evans in 1983 in the galaxy M83 long before it reached its peak, turned out to be the first discovery of a new type of supernova, later named Type 1b.Searching for Supernovae: A More Personal Story accessed 5 November 2010 In 2005, Evans resigned from being the chairman of the AAVSO Supernovae Search Committee after serving in that position for two decades. Evans lives in Hazelbrook, Australia where he writes books. Meanwhile he continues his supernova hunting using a 12-inch (31 cm) reflecting telescope from his back porch. The bulky telescope fell into disuse since the place in Hazelbrook didn't accommodate a permanent installation in the back yard. Research in evangelical revivals Robert Evans writes, publishes, prints and binds books on the history of evangelism in the 19th and 20th centuries under his imprint Research in Evangelical Revivals.

Early life  Jablonski's alcoholic father beat and sexually abused his wife and children. Jablonski met his first wife, Alice McGowan, in high school. He enlisted in the Army in 1966 and was sent overseas to fight in the Vietnam War. They married in 1968 when he returned to the U.S. While living in Texas, Jablonski became sexually violent. During sex he put a pillow over McGowan's face and attempted to suffocate her. On several occasions, he strangled her until she was unconscious. After McGowan left him, Jablonski became involved with Jane Sanders, who he met in November 1968. He raped Sanders on their first date, which she did not report. She became pregnant and they moved to California in July 1969, after Jablonski left the military. On one occasion, while having sex, Sanders wanted to stop. Jablonski pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot her if she did not continue. He hit her with the butt of the gun and she passed out. When she regained consciousness, he was having sex with her. She left him in 1972.  Criminal convictions  In late 1972, Jablonski raped a female acquaintance at knifepoint in her home, while her infant child was in the room. The woman escaped and ran to a neighbor's house, who called the police. Jablonski was arrested and convicted for the rape. In February 1977, Jablonski met Linda Kimball and by August they were living together. Kimball gave birth to their daughter in December 1977. On the evening of July 6, 1978, Kimball's mother Isobel Pahls, who lived nearby, was awakened by Jablonski. He told her he had come to rape her but did not go through with it because when he looked at her face \\"all he could see was Linda's face.\\" Pahls managed to escape to a neighbor's house and did not report the incident to police. A few days after the incident, Kimball left Jablonski and she and their daughter moved in with Pahls. On the morning of July 16, Kimball returned to the apartment she had shared with Jablonski to pick up belongings for their baby. That afternoon she was found dead inside the apartment. She had been beaten, stabbed, and strangled. Jablonski was arrested 11 days later. He served 12 years in prison for Kimball's murder; he was released on parole for good behavior in 1990, although in 1985 he had attempted to strangle his mother using a shoelace. Carol Spadoni met and married Jablonski in 1982, after answering a newspaper ad placed while Jablonski was serving time in prison. On April 23, 1991, Spadoni, 46, and her mother, Eva Petersen, 72, were murdered at their home in Burlingame. Spadoni was shot, suffocated with duct tape, then stabbed, while Petersen was sexually assaulted and shot. Jablonski was charged with the April 22, 1991, death of Fathyma Vann, 38, in Indio, California. Vann was a fellow student at the local community college that Jablonski attended to satisfy conditions of his parole. Vann, a recently widowed mother of two teenage girls, was found shot in the head and sexually assaulted, lying naked in a shallow ditch in the Indio desert with the words \\"I Love Jesus\\" carved in her back. Her body had been subjected to other mutilations including removal of her eyes and ears. Jablonski was also charged with the robbery and subsequent murder of Margie Rogers, 58, in Grand County, Utah, on April 27, 1991; she and her husband owned a store on Interstate 70, where her body was found. Rogers had been sexually assaulted and shot twice in the head. He was apprehended on April 28, 1991 in Kansas. He was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to death. In January 2006, the California Supreme Court upheld Jablonski's death sentence on appeal.  Death  Jablonski died on December 27, 2019 at the age of 73 in San Quentin State Prison in the cell.https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/california/serial-killer-phillip- jablonski-dies-on-california-death-row/2208490/ See all * List of serial killers in the United States References Category:1946 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Joshua Tree, California Category:Military personnel from California Category:American serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Criminals from California Category:American rapists Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by California Category:American prisoners sentenced to death Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American people who died in prison custody Category:People convicted of murder by California Category:Prisoners who died in California detention Category:American male criminals Category:Violence against women in the United States ","title":"Phillip Carl Jablonski"},{"id":"3628546","text":"Lower Guinea may refer to: * Maritime Guinea, the coastal region of the republic of Guinea.\\"Guinea\\". britannica.com.

In creating a black comedy revolving around the \\"lunatic characters\\" of Heller's satirical anti-war novel set at a fictional Mediterranean base during World War II, director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Buck Henry (also in the cast) worked on the film script for two years, converting Heller's complex novel to the medium of film. The cast included Alan Arkin, Bob Balaban, Martin Balsam, Richard Benjamin, Italian actress Olimpia Carlisi, French comedian Marcel Dalio, Art Garfunkel (his acting debut), Jack Gilford, Charles Grodin, Bob Newhart, Anthony Perkins, Austin Pendleton, Paula Prentiss, Martin Sheen, Jon Voight, and Orson Welles. Plot Captain John Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Force B-25 bombardier, is stationed on the Mediterranean base on Pianosa during World War II. Along with his squadron members, Yossarian is committed to flying dangerous missions, but after watching friends die, he seeks a means of escape. Futilely appealing to his commanding officer, Colonel Cathcart, who continually increases the number of missions required to rotate home before anyone can reach it, Yossarian learns that even a mental breakdown is no release when Doc Daneeka explains the \\"Catch-22\\" the Army Air Corps employs. While most crews are rotated out after twenty-five, the minimum number of missions for this base is eventually raised to an unobtainable eighty missions; a figure resulting from Colonel Cathcart's craving for publicity. Compliance with this insane number invokes regulation 22 for which, as explained by Doc Daneeka, there is a catch: An airman would have to be crazy to fly more missions, and if he were crazy he would be unfit to fly. Yet, if an airman would refuse to fly more missions, this would indicate that he is sane, which would mean that he would be fit to fly the missions. Another strange \\"catch\\" in the movie involves Major Major, who had recently been promoted by Brigadier General Dreedle, who didn't like the look of the name \\"Capt. Major\\" on the roll call. Capt. Major was promoted to Major Major and put in charge of a squadron, very much against his will. Major didn't want to be bothered, so he told First Sgt. Towser that if someone wanted to talk to Major Major, the person had to wait in the waiting room until office hours were over, unless Major wasn't in his office. Then the visitor could go right in, but Major wouldn't be there. Trapped by this convoluted logic, Yossarian watches as individuals in the squadron resort to unusual means to cope; Lt. Milo Minderbinder concocts elaborate black market schemes while crazed Captain \\"Aarfy\\" Aardvark commits murder to silence a girl he raped. Lieutenant Nately falls for a prostitute, Major Danby delivers goofy pep talks before every bomb run and Captain Orr keeps crashing at sea. Meanwhile, Nurse Duckett occasionally beds Yossarian. Nately dies as a result of an agreement between Milo and the Germans, trading surplus cotton in exchange for the squadron bombing its own base. While on a pass, Yossarian shares this news with Captain Nately's Whore, who then tries to kill him. Because of Yossarian's constant complaints, Colonel Cathcart and Lt. Colonel Korn eventually agree to send him home, promising him a promotion to Major and the awarding him a medal for the fictitious saving of Cathcart's life; the only requirement being that Yossarian agrees to \\"like\\" the Colonels and praise them when he gets home. Immediately after agreeing to Cathcart's and Korn's plan, Yossarian survives an attempt on his life when stabbed by Nately's Whore, who had disguised herself as an airman. Once recovered, Yossarian learns from the Chaplain and Major Danby that Captain Orr's supposed death was a hoax and that Orr's repeated 'crash' landings had been a subterfuge for practicing and planning his own escape from the madness. Yossarian is informed that after his last ditching Orr had paddled a rescue raft all the way to Sweden. Yossarian decides to ditch the deal with Cathcart, leaps out of the hospital window, takes a raft from a damaged plane and, while a marching band practices for the ceremony to award Yossarian the promotion and medal, he hops into the sea, climbs into the raft and starts paddling.

Despite the changes in the screenplay, Heller approved of the film, according to a commentary by Nichols and Steven Soderbergh included on a DVD release. According to Nichols, Heller was particularly impressed with a few scenes and bits of dialogue Henry created for the film, and said he wished he could have included them in the novel.Nichols and Soderbergh 2001 The pacing of the novel Catch-22 is frenetic, its tenor intellectual, and its tone largely absurdist,McCarthy, Todd. \\"Catch-22 (Review).\\" Variety, December 31, 1969. interspersed with brief moments of gritty, almost horrific, realism. The novel did not follow a normal chronological progression; rather, it was told as a series of different and often (seemingly, until later) unrelated events, most from the point of view of the central character Yossarian.

Reception Catch-22 was not regarded as a great success with the contemporary public or critics, earning less money and critical acclaim than the film version of MASH, another war-themed black comedy released earlier the same year. In addition, the film appeared as Americans were becoming more resentful of the bitter and ugly experience of the Vietnam War, leading to a general decline in the interest of war pictures, with the notable exceptions of MASH and Patton. Critic Lucia Bozzola wrote \\"Paramount spent a great deal of money on Catch-22, but it wound up getting trumped by another 1970 antiwar farce: Robert Altman's MASH.\\" Film historians and reviewers Jack Harwick and Ed Schnepf characterized it as deeply flawed, noting that Henry's screenplay was disjointed and that the only redeeming features were the limited aerial sequences.Harwick and Schnepf 1989, p. 62. Despite the film's commercial and critical failures, it was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 79% approval rating based on 28 reviews.

The chief nurse, in other words the person in charge of nursing in a hospital and the head of the nursing staff, is also known as the senior nursing officer, matron, nursing officer, or clinical nurse manager in UK English; the head nurse or director of nursing in US English, and the nursing superintendent or matron in Indian English, among other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations. In the United Kingdom, matrons today \\"have powers over budgets, catering and cleaning as well as being in charge of nurses\\" and \\"have the powers to withhold payments from catering and cleaning services if they don't think they are giving the best service to the NHS.\\" Historically, matrons supervised the hospital as a whole but today, they are in-charge of supervising two or three wards. The chief nurse is a registered nurse who supervises the care of all the patients at a health care facility. The chief nurse is the senior nursing management position in an organization and often holds executive titles like chief nursing officer (CNO), chief nurse executive, or vice-president of nursing. They typically report to the CEO or COO. History Plaques listing Matrons of Manchester Royal Infirmary The word \\"matron\\" is derived from the Latin for \\"mother\\", via French. The matron was once the most senior nurse in a hospital (in the United Kingdom before ca. 1972). She was responsible for all the nurses and domestic staff, overseeing all patient care, and the efficient running of the hospital, although she almost never had real power over the strategic running of the hospital. Matrons were almost invariably female‚Äîmale nurses were not at all common, especially in senior positions. They were often seen as fearsome administrators, but were respected by nurses and doctors alike. The National Health Service matron became memorably associated with the formidable character played by actress Hattie Jacques in the 1959 film Carry On Nurse and the 1967 film Carry On Doctor (and gentler portrayals in Carry On Again Doctor and Carry On Matron). The matron usually had a very distinctive uniform, with a dark blue dress (although often of a slightly different colour from those worn by her direct subordinates, the sisters) and an elaborate headdress. Contemporary matrons More recently, the British Government announced the return of the matron to the NHS, electing to call this new breed of nurses \\"modern matrons,\\" in response to various press complaints of dirty, ineffective hospitals with poorly disciplined staff. They are not intended to have the same level of responsibility as the old matrons, as they often oversee just one department (therefore a hospital may have many matrons‚Äîone for surgery, one for medicine, one for geriatrics, one for the accident & emergency department, etc.) but do have budgetary control regarding catering and cleaning contracts. In larger hospitals some will have a group of wards to manage. Their managerial powers are more limited, and they spend most of their time on administrative work rather than having direct responsibility for patient care. Many areas of the UK now employ Community Matrons. The role of this staff group is predominantly Clinical and these Matrons have a caseload of patients for whom they are clinically responsible. Many of these patients have chronic health conditions such as COPD, Emphysema, and/or palliative conditions which result in multiple hospital admissions. It is the aim of this staff group to treat the patient within the community thereby limiting hospital admissions. This staff group are predominantly Nurses, but there are other Allied Health Professionals also in the role such as Paramedics and Occupational Therapists. The nursing branches of the British Armed Forces have never abandoned the term \\"Matron\\", and it is used for male as well as female officers, usually holding the rank of Major (or equivalent) or above. It was formerly used as an actual rank in the nursing services. In South Africa and its former mandated territory South-West Africa (today's Namibia), Matron is the rank of the most senior nurse of a hospital. Other uses Long before women were commonly employed as fully sworn police officers, many police forces employed uniformed women with limited powers to search and attend to female prisoners and deal with matters specifically affecting women and children. These female officers were often known as \\"police matrons\\". Officers in women's prisons sometimes also used the title of \\"matron\\"; sometimes the matron was a senior officer who supervised the other wardresses. Institutions such as children's homes and workhouses were also run by matrons. The matron of a workhouse was very often the wife of the master and looked after the domestic affairs of the establishment. This was, in fact, the original meaning of the term. Its use in hospitals was borrowed from workhouses. The term was also used in boarding schools (and is still used in some British independent schools) for the woman in charge of domestic affairs in a boarding house or the school nurse. In the past, the matron was sometimes the wife of the housemaster. In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the female spouse of a temple president or his counselors is referred to as a temple matron.

The du Bourg hoax On the morning of Monday, 21 February 1814, a uniformed man posing as Colonel du Bourg, aide-de-camp to Lord Cathcart, arrived at the Ship Inn at Dover, England, bearing news that Napoleon I of France had been killed and the Bourbons were victorious. Requesting this information to be relayed on to the Admiralty in London via semaphore telegraph, \\"Colonel du Bourg\\" proceeded on toward London, stopping at each inn on the way to spread the good news. Three \\"French officers\\" dressed in Bourbon uniforms were also seen celebrating in London, and proclaiming the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. =Effects on the stock market= Rumours of Napoleon's defeat had been circulating throughout the month, and the combined events had a significant impact on the London Stock Exchange. The value of government securities soared in the morning, after the news from Dover began to circulate among traders at the Exchange. Lacking official confirmation of the news, prices began to slide after the initial rush, only to be further propped up at noon by the French officers and their handbills. However, the entire affair was a deliberate hoax. In the afternoon, the government confirmed that the news of peace was a fabrication. The affected stocks' prices immediately sank to their previous levels. =Investigation= The Committee of the Stock Exchange, suspecting deliberate stock manipulation, launched an investigation into the hoax. It was soon discovered that there had been a sale that Monday of more than ¬£1.1 million of two government-based stocks, most of it purchased the previous week. Eight people were eventually convicted of conspiracy to defraud, including Lord Cochrane, a Radical member of Parliament and well-known naval hero, his uncle the Hon. Andrew Cochrane-Johnstone, Richard Butt, Lord Cochrane's financial advisor, and Captain Random de Berenger, who had posed both as du Bourg and as one of the French officers. Six, including those involved in the purchases, were tried, and sentenced to twelve months of prison time, with the most prominent also sentenced to the public pillory; fines were also imposed. Lord Cochrane was stripped of his naval rank and expelled from the Order of the Bath. =Culpability of Lord Cochrane= Though convicted of the fraud, Lord Cochrane continued to assert his innocence. In 1816, he brought an (unsuccessful) charge of \\"partiality, misrepresentation, injustice and oppression\\" against Lord Ellenborough, the presiding judge in his case. Popular opinion certainly backed Cochrane; his sentencing was followed by his re-election to the House of Commons for Westminster. The pillory portion of his sentence was dropped, for fear of public reaction. Due to public outcry over his treatment, the punishment of the pillory was limited to those found guilty of perjury in England and Wales in 1816. Its use was completely discontinued in 1837 in England and Wales (though the stocks, a similar device, were used over the rest of the nineteenth century). Lord Cochrane continued to petition the government for redress; in 1832, he was granted a free pardon, including reinstatement to his rank of Rear Admiral. Restoration of the Order of the Bath and other honours followed in the subsequent decades, and, in 1877, a Select committee found that his treatment since 1832 constituted \\"nothing less than a public recognition by those Governments of his innocence.\\"  Literary references  Security speculation based on allegedly accurate news delivered by semaphore telegraph forms a plot event in the novel The Count of Monte Cristo (published 1844). The Great Stock Exchange Fraud forms the basis for the 11th novel in Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey‚ÄìMaturin series, The Reverse of the Medal (published 1986). Note In the terminology of 1814, stocks refer to interest-bearing securities of the type that are today called bonds. The fraud particularly involved a government bearer bond called the 'Omnium'.

History The 11th congressional district (together with the 12th) was created in 1913 based on the results of the 1910 United States Census. Prior to a redistricting in the early 1980s, the 11th congressional district was centered in Essex County. The congressional seat was held by Democrats for almost 36 years. The early 1980s redistricting, conducted under a Republican-dominated legislature, shifted the focus of the district to the Republican-dominated Morris County. In 1984, Republican Dean Gallo defeated 22-year incumbent Democrat Joseph Minish. The district became one of the most reliably Republican districts in the Northeast. =2018 election= In January 2018, 12-term incumbent Republican Rodney Frelinghuysen announced that he would not seek re-election; earlier, leading political observers had rated the district as a \\"toss-up\\" in the November 2018 election. Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot and federal prosecutor, was the Democratic nominee in 2018. Assemblymember Jay Webber of New Jersey's 26th Assembly District was the Republican nominee. Attorney Ryan Martinez was the Libertarian Party nominee. On November 6th, 2018, Sherrill prevailed by an unexpectedly large margin, defeating Webber 56.8%-42.1%. The district shifted 33% towards the Democrats; this was the largest partisan swing of any congressional district in the nation in 2018.  Recent national election results  { class=wikitable ! Year !

Bergegren was an early member of the newly founded Swedish Social Democratic Party and he represented a revolutionary tendency, best described as Anarcho-syndicalism (but did not later join the SAC, co-founded by followers of Hinke, and continued to criticize the union from an anarchist standpoint). He was an important figure in the publishing of the Brand, one of the oldest still published anarchist magazines in the world. Because of his anarchistic standpoints, Bergegren was later expelled from the Social Democratic Party by its leader Hjalmar Branting. Hinke Bergegren is mostly known for being an early agitator of free love. In 1910 he held the speech K√§rlek utan barn (Love without Children) in which he advocated for the legalization of birth control in Sweden. For this he was taken to court and received a short prison sentence under a newly adopted law known as Lex Hinke (named after Bergegren), which made it illegal to advocate birth control. In 1921, Hinke Bergegren joined the Swedish Communist Party, and the same year, Bergegren went to Moscow for the third congress of the Communist International to represent Sweden together with Zeth H√∂glund and Fredrik Str√∂m.

This practice is sometimes known as double jobbing in Britain and cumul des mandats in France; not to be confused with double dipping in the United States, i.e. being employed by and receiving a retirement pension from the same public authority at the same time. Thus, if someone who is already mayor of a town or city councillor becomes elected as MP or senator at the national or state legislature and retains both positions, this is a dual mandate. Political and legal approaches toward dual mandate-holding vary widely. In some countries, dual mandates are a well-established part of the political culture; in others they may be prohibited by law. For example, in federal states, federal office holders are often not permitted to hold state office. In states with a presidential system of government, membership of the executive, the legislature, or the judiciary generally disqualifies a person from simultaneously holding office in either of the other two bodies. In states with bicameral legislatures, one usually cannot simultaneously be a member of both houses. The holder of one office who wins election or appointment to another where a dual mandate is prohibited must either resign the former office or refuse the new one. European Parliament A member of the European Parliament (MEP) may not be a member of the national legislature of a member state. This dates from a 2002 European Union decision, which came into effect at the 2004 European elections in most member states, at the 2007 national election in the Republic of Ireland, and at the 2009 European elections in the United Kingdom. Originally, MEPs were nominated by national parliamentarians from among their own membership. Prior to the first direct elections in 1979, the dual mandate was discussed. Some advocated banning it, arguing that MEPs who were national MPs were often absent from one assembly in order to attend the other (indeed, the early death of Peter Michael Kirk was blamed by his election agent on overwork resulting from his dual mandate). Others claimed that members with a dual mandate enhanced communication between national and European assemblies. There was a particular interest in the dual mandate question in Denmark: Eurosceptic Danish Social Democrats supported a compulsory dual mandate, to ensure that the state's MEPs expressed the same views as the national legislature, and the government of Denmark supported a compulsory dual mandate when the other eight member states supported an optional dual mandate. However, a 1976 European Parliament law preparing for the 1979 elections expressly permitted a dual mandate. In 1978 the German politician Willy Brandt suggested that one third of MEPs should be national MPs. Australia Dual mandates are rare in Australia. It is illegal to be a member of any state parliament and the Australian Parliament simultaneously. A member of a state parliament seeking federal office must resign before seeking election to the Federal Parliament. It is possible but unusual to be a member of a local government and another parliament. A recent example is Dr Kerryn Phelps who maintained her position as a Councillor on the City of Sydney Council while sitting in Federal Parliament as the Member for Wentworth between 2018 and 2019. In 2004 Clover Moore became the independent member for Sydney in the NSW Parliament without resigning as Lord Mayor of Sydney. The issue of Moore holding both positions had brought the issue to the forefront in Australia and led the premier of New South Wales in 2012 to propose a new law, dubbed in the media as the \\"Get Clover bill\\", which banned this dual mandate. The proposed law was adopted and in September 2012 Moore resigned her NSW seat soon after she was reelected as mayor. Belgium As in neighboring France, the culture of dual mandates is very strong in Belgium and that country currently has one of the highest percentage of dual mandate holders (MPs, aldermen, municipal councilors) in the world. During the 2003‚Äì2009 period, 87.3% of members of the Walloon (French-speaking) Parliament held dual mandates, followed by 86.5% in the Flemish (Dutch-speaking) Parliament, 82 0% in the Chamber of Representatives (the Federal lower house) and 68.9% in the Senate. During that same period, 76.5% of all European Parliament MPs from Belgium held dual mandates. More than one-fifth of all Belgian MPs were mayor at the same time with, by far, by the highest proportion (40%) to be found in the Walloon Parliament.Gert-Jan Put and Ine Vanlangenakker, \\"The extent of multiple office-holding in Belgium (2003-2009). An exploration of the underlying reasons.\\" PhD Thesis, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (2010), pp. 10‚Äì11. Canada In Canada dual mandates are rare and are frequently barred by legislation at the federal, provincial, or territorial level. At the federal level, section 39 of the Constitution Act, 1867 prevents a Senator from being elected as a Member of Parliament; similarly, s. 65(c) of the Canada Elections Act makes members of provincial or territorial legislatures ineligible to be candidates to the House of Commons. At the provincial level, the situation varies from one province to another. In most circumstances, an elected official almost always resigns their first post when elected to another. Dual representation has occurred occasionally when the member was elected to a second office shortly before their other term of office was due to expire anyway and whereby the short time frame would not merit the cost of a special by-election. In 1996, for example, Jenny Kwan continued to be a Vancouver city councillor after being elected to the provincial legislature. The British Columbia legislature had debated a \\"Dual Office Prohibition Act\\" which failed to pass second reading. In the first few years after Confederation in 1867, however, double mandates were common. In the first House of Commons, there were fifteen Members of Parliament from Quebec who simultaneously held seats in the National Assembly of Quebec, including the Premier Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau. There were also four members of Parliament from Ontario who also held seats in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, including the first two Premiers, John Sandfield Macdonald and Edward Blake. Other prominent federal politicians with double mandates included George-√âtienne Cartier, Christopher Dunkin, Hector Langevin, the second Premier of British Columbia Amor de Cosmos, and two members from Manitoba, Donald Smith and Pierre Delorme. Another famous example is that of the de facto leader of the Liberals, George Brown, who ran for both federal and provincial seats in 1867. Brown lost both elections, and soon thereafter began campaigning for the prohibition of double mandates. The double mandate was prohibited from the start in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick; it was abolished in Ontario in 1872, in Manitoba in 1873, and in 1873 the federal parliament passed a law against it; Quebec passed its own law abolishing it in 1874. However, dual mandates within a province remained legal. From 1867 to 1985, 305 mayors were also members of the Quebec legislative assembly (MLA). The two best-known cases were those of S.N. Parent who was simultaneously mayor of Quebec City (1894-1906), MLA and Premier of Quebec (1900-1905). Longtime Montreal Mayor Camilien Houde (1928‚Äì32, 1938‚Äì40) was also simultaneously MLA for a total of 2 /1/2 years during his mandates as mayor. However that type of dual mandate had virtually ceased when laws adopted in 1978 and 1980 prohibited MNAs from holding any local mandate. Finland It is common for the MPs of the Finnish Parliament to hold a mandate as a member of their local municipal council as well. 79 percent of MPs elected to parliament in 2011 were also municipal council members. France The cumul des mandats (, accumulation of mandates) is a common practice in the Fifth French Republic (1958‚Äìpresent).At the time Pierre Mauroy was prime minister (1981‚Äì84), he kept his job as mayor of Lille, one of France's largest cities, without anyone objecting. France has had legions of d√©put√©s-maires, s√©nateurs-maires and ministres-maires. It consists of simultaneously holding two or more elective offices at different levels of government ‚Äî local, regional, national and European ‚Äî as mayors, MPs, senators, Members of the European Parliament, and President of the General Council in their home regions. Sometimes, officials hold as many as four positions. While officials may not be elected to more than one office at the same level (such as being both an MP and a senator), they may hold offices in any combination at the municipal, departmental, regional, national and European levels. The cumul des mandats is controversial in France, being accused of fostering absenteeism and cronyism. Several laws to limit the practice have been introduced in recent decades. By far the most coveted local mandate is that of mayor, traditionally a highly prestigious function in France. A hotly debated law to prohibit all dual mandates, to take effect in 2017, was adopted in July 2013. Following the adoption of the law, former President Sarkozy and other members of the opposition UMP party have declared that if elected in 2017, their party would revise or even revoke that law. Many Socialist Party MPs and senators have also expressed their unease with the law imposed by President Hollande and might welcome a review of the law. In the meantime, the ubiquitous 'd√©put√©-maire' (MP and mayor) and 's√©nateur-maire' are still familiar figures of the French political scene. =Conditions regarding multiple mandates in France= * The President of the Republic cannot hold any other office during his or her tenure. ** However, Presidents do ex officio hold the office of Co-Prince in the neighboring microstate of Andorra, a role and title they share with the Bishop of Urgell. In practice, each send a personal representative, a sort of viceroy, to Andorra to act on their behalf. Multiple mandates at the legislative level Parliamentary mandates are incompatible with each other: *Member of the National Assembly of France *Member of the Senate of France *Member of the European Parliament A member from one of the above assemblies can not combine its mandate with more than one of the following mandates : *Member, vice- president or president of a General Council *Member, vice-president or president of a Regional Council *Councillor, deputy-mayor, or mayor of a commune of more than 3,500 inhabitants *Councillor of Paris (The \\"Council of Paris\\" is at the same level a municipal council and a general council, because Paris has a special status, municipality and d√©partement at the same level) *Councillor in the Corsican Assembly (Corse has a regional special status) Exceptions: They can hold a third office in a town of less than 3,500 inhabitants. They may also hold a third office as a councillor, vice-president or president of an urban community, an agglomeration community or a communaut√© de communes, as these terms are elected by indirect universal suffrage, by municipal councils from among the councillors. For example, a member of the National Assembly has the right to be general/regional councillor or President of a regional/general council. They cannot hold a third office unless they are the mayor, deputy mayor or municipal councillor of a city of less than 3,500 inhabitants. In 2008, 85% of members of parliament held multiple posts Sciolino, Elaine, French Cabinet Position Not Enough? Then Try Mayor, The New York Times, January 13, 2008. Accessed March 26, 2012. Following the June 2012 legislative elections, it was still the case that 85% of all National Assembly members (438 deputies out of 577) held a double mandate (often as mayor of a mid- to large-size city) and 33 have four mandates. Currently, out of 348 senators, 152 are also mayors. The accumulation of local mandates They cannot have more than two local mandates. The following mandates are incompatible each other: *Mayor *President of the General Council *President of the Regional Council For example, an elected official cannot be mayor and President of the Regional Council. However, all other local mandates are cumulative. A mayor can also be a general councillor and a president of a Regional Council can also be deputy-mayor of a city. Exceptions are the same as those for parliamentarians (Cities of less than 3,500 inhabitants and the intercommunalities) The accumulation of mandates and governmental functions MP-mayor of Belfort and the senator-mayor of Beaucourt at a ceremony in 2014 A member of the French government cannot be a member of any assembly. However, he may retain any local mandate he or she holds. A cabinet minister can exercise a maximum of two local mandates in addition to his or her government function. For example, the Prime Minister, a Minister or Secretary of State can be mayor, or President of a general, regional or intercommunal council or sit in one of these assemblies. Currently, over two-thirds of the members of the French government are engaged in one or two more local mandates. =Purpose and frequency= The rationales for holding multiple offices are varied. Holding a seat in the Senate, National Assembly, or European Parliament gives local mayors a valuable method of tapping funds to develop their home cities and regions.Gildea, pg. 240 It also can give opportunities to curry favor with other important officials, with opportunities at each level.Nadeau and Barlow, pg. 56 Salaries for positions can be combined (to a point) as well. For politicians with national ambitions, retaining a position in a local town can give them a down-to-earth aura that can appeal to voters. These advantages have made politicians very wary of reducing the practice of the cumul with legislation despite other moves to end perceptions of favoritism and corruption among politicians.Gildea, pg. 281 It has been common practice in France since the Third Republic (1870). But there are also many cases of \\"cumul\\" before this period, for example, the writer Alexis de Tocqueville was a member from 1839 to 1851. In 1849 he was appointed Foreign Affairs minister, and at the same time he was elected President of the General Council of Manche from 1849 to 1851 (councillor from 1842 to 1852). There are several reasons for this phenomenon, and one of them is that France has a long tradition of centralization, compared to countries such as Germany, Italy, and Spain. Local governments have fewer powers and resources than the those possessed by the L√§nder of Germany, or Autonomous Communities of Spain possess. The local mandates in France are less important than in other countries, and therefore politicians have more time to devote to a parliamentary mandate. The cumul is a widespread practice and has grown much more prevalent in modern France. In 1946, 36 percent of deputies in the National Assembly held an additional office. By 1956, this number had already increased to 42 percent and by 1970, 70 percent of deputies held an additional elected office; in 1988, 96 percent did. Many of the most prominent politicians in France make use or have made use of the cumul. Jacques Chirac served as Mayor of Paris between 1977 and 1995. During this same time, Chirac also served as a deputy in the National Assembly from Corr√®ze, briefly as Member of the European Parliament, and even as Prime Minister between 1986 and 1988. Former Prime Minister Pierre B√©r√©govoy served concurrently as mayor of Nevers and deputy of Ni√®vre in the mid-1980s. An example: the accumulation of four electoral mandates Yves J√©go's four mandates, between March 2010 and July 2011. According to French law\\"French Interior Ministry\\" \\"Le cumul des mandats √©lectoraux\\" (in French) against accumulation of electoral mandates, Yves J√©go should have resigned from one of the following mandates before April 21, 2010 (one month after the Regional elections): *Member of the National Assembly of France for Seine-et-Marne *Regional councillor of √éle-de-France *Mayor of Montereau-Fault-Yonne But giving as a pretext a legal complaint from the Front National's candidates, he held the three of them for more than a year, plus his local mandate of president of the communaut√© de communes des deux fleuves (CC2F). =Recent and current status of cumul in the French government= Lionel Jospin (Prime Minister from 1997 to 2002) imposed on his government ministers an unwritten rule of having no local office. For example, Catherine Trautmann stepped down as Mayor of Strasbourg (while remaining a member of the city council) to become Minister of Culture; conversely, Martine Aubry stepped down from the Ministry of Labour when elected Mayor of Lille in 2001. This rule was more or less upheld by Jacques Chirac during the governments of Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Dominique de Villepin for the 2002‚Äì2007 term, with a few notable exceptions (Jean-Fran√ßois Cop√© was mayor of Meaux, Nicolas Sarkozy was President of the Hauts-de-Seine General Council); for instance, Philippe Douste-Blazy had to step down from the Toulouse mayorship upon joining the government. , no such rule was stated for the Fran√ßois Fillon government: Alain Jupp√©, former Minister for Development was mayor of Bordeaux, and was defeated in his National Assembly constituency (a third cumulative mandate) by 50.9% to 49.1% of the votes by the Socialist candidate. Additionally, Herv√© Morin, the Minister of Defense, is mayor of √âpaignes, and √âric Besson, Minister of Immigration and National Identity, is the mayor of Donz√®re. Hong Kong In Hong Kong, dual mandate is common for members of the territory's Legislative Council, who serve concurrently as members of one of the territory's eighteen district councils. Before the abolition of the two municipal councils in the territory in 1999, it was common for politicians to serve concurrently at all three levels. It is also normal for Legislative Council members and District Concil's members to hold position with China's National People's Congress and Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, with those positions appointed by the Chinese Government. Ireland The instability caused by the close result of the 1981 general election was exacerbated by the number of government TDs who also served as MEPs and for whom the opposition refused pairing when they were abroad. This led to further elections in February 1982 and again in November. In 1991, cabinet ministers and junior ministers were prohibited from serving as local councillors. The prohibition was extended to other Oireachtas members by the Local Government (No. 2) Act 2003, an amendment to the Local Government Act 2001. Attempts to include it in the 2001 Act failed after a rebellion by Fianna F√°il backbenchers; the 2003 Act passed after a compensation package was agreed for those losing out. The 2001 Act prohibited being a member of multiple county or city councils, or multiple town councils, or both a town and city council. Brian O'Shea was a member of both Waterford City Council and Waterford County Council until 1993. County councillors were allowed to sit on a town council, and many did so. The 2003 Act provided that a candidate elected simultaneously to a forbidden combination of local councils has three days to choose which seat to take up, with the other or others then being considered vacant. The Local Government Reform Act 2014 abolished town councils and instead subdivided most counties into municipal districts; the county council's members are the district councillors for all districts within the county. Malaysia Dual mandate is common in Malaysia. According to the Federal Constitution, a Member of Parliament (MP), whether elected to the Dewan Rakyat or appointed to the Dewan Negara, cannot hold membership in both houses of the Parliament. However, an MP may be elected as member of a State Legislative Assembly (MLA) at the same time. Consequently, an MP may be appointed to the State Cabinet through appointment as a nominated MLA while an MLA may be appointed as Minister or Deputy Minister in the Federal Government due to having membership in the Parliament. At present: * Ahmad Faizal Azumu, MP for Tambun and MLA of Perak for Chenderiang, is Menteri Besar of Perak. * Amiruddin Hamzah, MP for Kubang Pasu and MLA of Kedah for Anak Bukit, is Federal Deputy Minister of Finance. * Anthony Loke Siew Fook, MP for Seremban and MLA of Negeri Sembilan for Chennah, is Federal Minister of Transport. * Christina Liew Chin Jin, MP for Tawau and MLA of Sabah for Api-Api, is Deputy Chief Minister and Minister of State for Tourism, Culture and Environment of Sabah. * Chong Chieng Jen, MP for Stampin and MLA of Sarawak for Kota Sentosa, is Federal Deputy Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs. * Chow Kon Yeow, MP for Tanjong and MLA of Penang for Padang Kota, is Chief Minister of Penang. * Lim Guan Eng, MP for Bagan and MLA of Penang for Air Putih, is Federal Minister of Finance. * Mohamed Azmin Ali, MP for Gombak and MLA of Selangor for Bukit Antarabangsa, is Federal Minister of Economic Affairs. * Muhyiddin Yassin, MP for Pagoh and MLA of Johor for Gambir, is Federal Minister of Home Affairs. * Mohd. Shafie Apdal, MP for Semporna and MLA of Sabah for Senallang, is Chief Minister of Sabah. * Mukhriz Mahathir, MP for Jerlun and MLA of Kedah for Jitra, is Menteri Besar of Kedah. * Mustapa Mohamed, MP for Jeli, is also MLA of Kelantan for Ayer Lanas. * Ngeh Koo Ham, MP for Beruas, is Speaker of Perak State Legislative Assembly and, thus, the only Nominated MLA of Perak. * Saifuddin Nasution Ismail, MP for Kulim-Bandar Baharu and MLA of Penang for Pantai Jerejak, is Federal Minister of Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs. * Wilfred Madius Tangau, MP for Tuaran and Nominated MLA of Sabah, is Deputy Chief Minister and Minister of State for Trade and Industry of Sabah. Spain Per the Spanish Constitution, legislators in the regional assemblies of the Autonomous Communities are barred from being elected to a seat in the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the Cortes Generales. More precisely, regional legislators can run for the seat, but if elected they must choose between the regional and national parliaments. Nevertheless, members of lower tiers of the Spanish decentralized structure, such as provincial councillors or members of local councils, including mayors, can and have held seats in the Congress of Deputies. The rule barring regional legislators does not apply to the upper house of the Cortes, the Senate: in fact, regional legislatures are entitled to appoint a varying number of members from their ranks to the Senate, according to the population of the region. Currently, the Autonomous Communities appoint 56 Senators, the other 208 being directly elected in general elections. United Kingdom At the EU level, prior to the 2009 European Parliament elections, there were a small number of members of the European Parliament who were also members of the House of Lords. However, it is now European law that a member of the European Parliament (MEP) may not be a member of the legislature of a member state. This, with regard to the United Kingdom, therefore applied to the House of Commons and the House of Lords, as the constituent bodies forming that member state's legislature. As it is impossible to disclaim a life peerage, it was ruled that peers (who sit as members of the House of Lords) had take a \\"leave of absence\\" from the Lords in order to be an MEP; this was also the procedure for when a peer is the UK's European Commissioner, which was in recent times usually the case. The UK withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020, ending British representation in the European Parliament. There have been members of the House of Commons also holding seats in the devolved bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The November 2009 report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life into the controversy surrounding MPs' expenses noted that \\"double jobbing\\" was \\"unusually ingrained in the political culture\\" of Northern Ireland, where 16 of 18 MPs were MLAs, compared to one Scottish MP being an MSP (First Minister Alex Salmond), and no Welsh MPs being AMs. The Committee recommended that Westminster ban multiple mandates from the 2011 assembly elections. Parties in Northern Ireland agreed to a ban from the 2015 elections. The ability to dual mandate between the Assembly of Northern Ireland and the House of Commons (or the Irish D√°il √âireann) ended as from the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly election following the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014. The Wales Act 2014 also applied a similar restriction on the National Assembly for Wales (now the Welsh Parliament) as from the Assembly election in 2016. As of 2019, it remains possible for members of the Scottish Parliament to be members of the UK Parliament, though at present none are.Scottish Parliament Dual Mandates In circumstances other than the Greater Manchester mayoralty, UK law does not prohibit a member of the House of Commons or the House of Lords from being simultaneously a mayor or council leader. They are also not allowed to serve as a councillor for a constituent council if elected as a directly elected mayor. Thus Ken Livingstone remained MP for Brent East until the dissolution of Parliament despite his election as Mayor of London a year before. Boris Johnson resigned his seat as MP for Henley on being elected mayor in 2008, but became an MP again in 2015, a year prior to the end of his second term as mayor (he did not seek a third term). Sadiq Khan, elected as the Labour mayor in the 2016 election, resigned his seat as MP for Tooting soon after his election to the mayoralty. Numerous members of the House of Lords however hold positions in local government. At a lower level, it is common for people to hold seats on both a district council and a county council. Several MPs have also retained their council seats, most often until the expiration of their terms; Mike Hancock simultaneously held a council seat and a seat in Parliament between his election to Parliament in 1997 and his defeat in the local elections in 2014. Some members of the Irish republican party Sinn F√©in held the office as a Member of The Northern Ireland Assembly and Member of Parliament within the respective houses. Martin McGuinness, former Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland held the office as Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly and simultaneously was an MP in the House of Commons. However, in 2012 Sinn F√©in committed to end dual jobbing; this resulted in McGuinness' resignation from the House of Commons in 2013. United States The term dual mandate is also applied to the twin objectives of the Federal Reserve System: to control inflation and promote employment. =Federal= The United States Constitution prohibits members of the Senate or House from holding positions within the Executive Branch (Art. I, Sec. 6, cl. 2), and limits the president to his salary as chief executive, saying he may not \\"receive... any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them\\" (Art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 7). However, the Constitution places no restrictions that would prevent state or local office holders from simultaneously holding office in any branch of the federal government. Historically, the U.S. inherited many basic political traditions from Great Britain, which in the eighteenth century tolerated several different forms of dual mandate. Following the establishment of the original Continental Congress and later Confederation Congress, the states possessed absolute discretion in regards to how delegates were chosen to serve, and it became common for state legislatures to appoint members from within their own ranks to Congress. At the time, this was a largely uncontroversial practise since it was widely assumed that the Congress would have relatively little to do (especially in peacetime) and that most of the consequential decision-making would take place at the state and local levels. A ban on dual mandates would therefore have been widely seen as unnecessary and unwelcome as it would have effectively barred Congressional delegates from what were perceived to be more important political posts, thus making election to the national Congress (already seen as a considerable burden due to the difficulties of eighteenth century travel) quite undesirable. During the convention that established the present U.S. constitution, attention was primarily given to designing a federal government with branches that would be able operate independently of each other and free of undesirable foreign influence, which resulted in the aforementioned prohibitions. Barring state and local officials from federal office was not seriously debated. If it had been, it would likely have been fiercely opposed especially by the nascent anti-Federalist movement, many of whose members were keen to ensure that state officials with a vested interest in defending states' rights would be allowed to also serve simultaneously at the federal level, especially in Congress. For the first few decades after the First United States Congress convened in 1789, Congress met infrequently and some states endeavored to accommodate dual mandates by holding their legislative sessions at times that would not conflict with Congressional sessions. Eventually, as the federal government grew in importance, Congress came to be seen as a source of great power. This created the potential for conflicts of interest and made it increasingly difficult to justify the holding of mandates at different levels of government to voters. In a closely related development, Congress began meeting more frequently than originally intended, which eventually made it impractical in most states for one person to serve simultaneously in the state and federal governments. In time, the vast majority of states banned dual state and federal mandates. Today, the practice is forbidden by many state constitutions of many U.S. states, but as of January 2018 it was still legal in Connecticut, only for municipal offices. Unlike many other attempts at the state level intended to place additional restrictions besides those in the U.S. Constitution regarding who can represent them in Congress, most of which have been ruled unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, state-originated bans on dual mandates are constitutional because their prohibitions technically restrict who is allowed to serve at the state and/or local level (i.e. they typically place some sort of de jure prohibition barring federal officials from simultaneously serving at the state and/or local levels, resulting in a de facto prohibition on the reverse arrangement occurring). Unlike many federations, U.S. states do not generally restrict state or federal officials from seeking office at another level of government without resigning their existing offices first. For example, in the four U.S. presidential elections contested from 1988 to 2000 inclusive, three sitting state governors were nominated for the presidency, these being Michael Dukakis in 1988, Bill Clinton in 1992 and George W. Bush in 2000 (Clinton and Bush were elected president), while in 2016 sitting governor Mike Pence was elected vice president. Elsewhere, serving state officials often seek federal office, one prominent example being Illinois State Senator Barack Obama's election to the United States Senate in 2004 - Obama quickly resigned from the Illinois Senate after being elected to the U.S. Senate despite not being legally required to do so, and served as a U.S. senator until 2008 when he was elected president. Also, it is not uncommon for sitting federal officials to contest election to state offices, although in these cases the office sought is usually one of the state's highest political posts, typically governor - one such recent example being the aforementioned Mike Pence who was a sitting U.S. Representative when he was first elected governor. Also typically permitted is for one person to seek multiple offices at the same level of government in the same election, although attempting to simultaneously seek multiple offices in the same branch of government (e.g. a sitting U.S. Representative seeking re-election to the House and election to the U.S. Senate) is severely frowned on and prohibited in many states (the constitutionality of these prohibitions is uncertain). Recent examples include the 2000 and 2012 presidential elections where Senator Joe Lieberman and Representative Paul Ryan respectively sought re-election and election to the vice presidency - neither was elected vice president, but both were re-elected to the offices in which they were the incumbents. =Florida= In April 1984, Governor of Florida Bob Graham received legislation that passed unanimously in both houses of the Florida Legislature that would forbid public officials from receiving retirement pay and regular pay simultaneously for the same position.via Associated Press. \\"Governor Receives Legislation to Halt 'Double Dipping'\\", Sarasota Herald-Tribune, April 19, 1984.

At the time that the legislation first passed, there were some twenty elected officials who served in the New Jersey Legislature and another elected office, including Assemblyman Bill Pascrell, who was also mayor of Paterson, New Jersey; State Senator Ronald Rice, who also served on the Newark City Council; and Assemblyman John E. Rooney, who was also mayor of Northvale. These officials protested the proposed ban as interfering with the will of voters to elect officials as they see fit.Strum, Charles. \\"New Jersey Politicians Serve Public, Twice\\", The New York Times, December 27, 1992.

The team is organised by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB), a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), which represents fifteen countries and territories. At the inaugural edition of the World Cup, in 1973, two teams that now compete as part of the West Indies, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, competed separately. A combined West Indian team made its Test debut in 1976 (almost 50 years after its male counterpart), and its One Day International (ODI) in 1979. The West Indies currently competes in the ICC Women's Championship, the highest level of the sport, and has participated in five of the ten editions of the Women's Cricket World Cup held to date. At the most recent 2013 World Cup, the team made the tournament's final for the first time, but lost to Australia.

In 1976‚Äì77 the same team then played a six Test series away to India. They lost the fourth and then won the sixth Test by over an innings to level the series. The remaining games were drawn. 1979 then saw the Windies play their third Test series, this time away to England. However, they fared poorly, losing the first and third Tests and drawing the second to go down 2‚Äì0. Finally, in 2003‚Äì04, after a 24-year wait, the West Indies resumed Test cricket with a one-off match away to Pakistan, this time played over 4 days. The result was a draw. =One-Day International history= When the first World Cup was played in 1973, the West Indies did not compete as an individual unit.

Additionally, three West Indian players participated in an International XI side that also competed in the 1973 World Cup. None of the teams fared well, however, with the International XI finishing in fourth place out of seven with a record of won three, lost two and one no result; Trinidad and Tobago finishing fifth with two wins and four losses; and Jamaica finishing sixth with one win, four losses and one match abandoned. The first one-day internationals (ODIs) played by a combined West Indian side were two games away to England during their 1979 tour. Three ODIs were planned, but the second ODI was washed out without a ball being bowled. In the first ODI, England won comfortably by eight wickets, and in the third ODI saw the West Indies level the series with a two wicket win. 1993 saw West Indian players compete in a World Cup for the second time, this time as part of a combined team. They finished seventh, with only Denmark and the Netherlands below them, after winning only two and losing five of their seven matches. Their next games were in the 1997‚Äì98 World Cup, where they finished in ninth place, above only Denmark and Pakistan. The only match they won was the 9th place play-off game against the Danes. 2002‚Äì03 saw the Sri Lankan women's cricket team tour the West Indies and play a six-match ODI series, which the Sri Lankan's won six-nil. The closest match was the fourth, where the Windies went down by only 9 runs. 2003 saw the Windies greatest cricketing success, when they finished second in the International Women's Cricket Council Trophy, after winning four and losing one of their five games. The Trophy was competed for by the weaker ODI sides ‚Äì Ireland, Windies, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Scotland and Japan. 2003‚Äì04 saw the Windies play five ODIs in India followed by a seven ODI and one Test tour to Pakistan. All five games against India were lost comfortably. As expected, the tour to Pakistan was more successful and the ODI series was won five-two. They finished fifth in the 2004‚Äì05 World Cup, ahead of Sri Lanka, South Africa and Ireland, but behind Australia, India, New Zealand and India. They won two and lost three games, with one no result and one abandoned match. After being eliminated from the World Cup, the team stayed on to play three ODIs against South Africa and won the series two-nil. =Tournament history= Women's Cricket World Cup *1973 to 1988: Did not participate *1993: 6th place *1997: 9th place *2000: Did not participate *2005: 5th place *2009: 5th place *2013: 2nd place ICC Women's World Twenty20 *2009: 5th place *2010: Semi-Finalists *2012: Semi-Finalists *2014: Semi-Finalists *2016: Champions *2018: Semi-Finalists ICC Women's Cricket Challenge *2010: 1st place Honours ICC Women's World Twenty20 (1): 2016  Current squad Coaching staff * Team Manager: Evril Betty Lewis * Head Coach: Gus Logie * Assistant Coach: Courtney Walsh * Assistant Coach: Rayon Griffith * Physiotherapist: Marita Marshall * Strength and Conditioning Coach: Shayne Cooper * Team Psychologist: Olivia Rose Esperance * Team Analyst: Gary Belle * Team Media Officer: Nassira Mohammed Records =Test cricket= *Highest team total: 440 v Pakistan, 15 March 2004 at National Stadium, Karachi, Pakistan *Highest individual innings: 118, Nadine George v Pakistan, 15 March 2004 at National Stadium, Karachi, Pakistan *Best innings bowling: 5/48, Vivalyn Latty-Scott v Australia, 7 May 1976 at Montego Bay, Jamaica *Best match bowling: 5/26, Peggy Fairweather v India, 27 November 1976 at Jammu, India =ODI cricket= *Highest team total: 368/8 v Sri Lanka, 3 February 2013 at Mumbai, India *Highest individual innings: 171, Stafanie Taylor v Sri Lanka, 3 February 2013 at Mumbai, India *Best innings bowling: 5/36, Cherry-Ann Singh v Ireland, 29 July 1993 at Dorking, England =T20I cricket= *Highest team total: 191/4 v Netherlands, 16 October 2010 at Potchefstroom, South Africa See also *Women's cricket *List of West Indian women's Test cricketers *List of West Indian women's ODI cricketers *West Indian men's cricket team References External links *Cricket Archive details of West Indies in women's Tests *Cricket Archive detaiils of West Indies in women's ODIs Category:Women's national cricket teams ","title":"West Indies women's cricket team"},{"id":"3628702","text":"On-Demand Routing (\\"ODR\\") is an enhancement to Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP), a protocol used to discover other Cisco devices on either broadcast or non- broadcast media.

He is the Chief of the HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch in the NCI and also coordinates HIV/AIDS malignancy research throughout the NCI as director of the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM). Education and career Dr. Yarchoan was raised in Oceanside, New York and graduated from Amherst College in 1971. He subsequently received his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and completed an internship and residency in internal medicine at the University of Minnesota and a fellowship in Immunology in the Metabolism Branch of the NCI. After completing his training he joined the laboratory of Dr. Samuel Broder. In 1991 he was appointed to be a Section Chief of the Medicine Branch and in 1996 he named chief of the newly formed HIV and AIDS Malignancy Branch. Dr. Yarchoan was also appointed to be the first director of the NCI Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM) in 2007, which supervises all HIV/AIDS and AIDS malignancy research within the NCI. Medical and Research Achievements Along with his colleagues Drs. Samuel Broder and Hiroaki Mitsuya in the National Cancer Institute (NCI), he co-developed the first effective treatments for HIV/AIDS. With his colleagues, he conducted the first clinical trials of zidovudine (AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), and lamivudine (3TC). These trials were the first to demonstrate that administration of anti-retroviral drugs could reverse the declines in CD4 cells and immunologic impairment caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Dr. Yarchoan also conducted the first trials of combination anti- HIV therapy. The development of these drugs was a breakthrough in AIDS therapy. Zidovudine and didanosine were components of early highly active antiretroviral drug therapy (HAART), and zidovudine, didanosine, and lamivudine remain in widespread use and are included in the World Health Organization's \\"Essential Drugs List\\", which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic health care system. It is estimated that the development of these and other AIDS drugs have saved over 3 million life-years in the United States and over 15 million life-years throughout the world. His research efforts have also focused on AIDS malignancies, focusing on the pathogenesis and treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma and other virus-associated tumors. He led the first clinical studies showing that paclitaxel was an effective therapy for Kaposi's sarcoma and that thalidomide has activity in this disease. He also developed several novel therapies for Multicentric Castleman's disease caused by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also called human herpesvirus-8 [HHV-8]. With his colleagues at NCI, he also identified a new disease called KSHV-Associated Cytokine Syndrome (KICS) in some people with HIV/AIDS. Awards and honors Yarchoan is a co-editor of several journals. He has received many awards, including the Assistant Secretary for Health Award and the U.S. Public Health Service Outstanding Service Medal. He also was awarded the first National Institutes of Health (NIH) World AIDS Day Award in December, 2006 for his work in developing drugs for AIDS. In November, 2007, he was awarded the NCI HIV/AIDS Research Excellence Award along with his colleagues, Drs. Samuel Broder, Robert C. Gallo, and Hiroaki Mitsuya. In October 2009, he received the National Cancer Institute Director's Awards of Merit for leadership in promoting and supporting HIV/AIDS research and HIV- associated malignancies at the National Cancer Institute, and in 2014 received the American Society for Microbiology Award in Clinical and Diagnostic Immunology. He has been inducted as a member of the American Society for Clinical Investigation, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), and in 2016 as a member of the Association of American Physicians. In 2013, Dr. Yarchoan received an honorary degree for his contributions to HIV/AIDS research from his alma mater, Amherst College.

In Spanish-speaking countries such as Cuba and Puerto Rico, they are called ingenios. The word engenho usually only referred to the mill, but it could also describe the area as a whole including land, a mill, the people who farmed and who had a knowledge of sugar production, and a crop of sugar cane. A large estate was required because of the massive amount of labor needed to yield refined sugar, molasses, or rum from raw sugar cane. These estates were prevalent in Brazil, Cuba, Dominican Republic, and other countries in the Caribbean. Today, Brazil is still one of the world's major producers of sugar.  Sugarcane in Brazil  Sugarcane was not introduced to Brazil until the Portuguese established the production of it in the middle of the 16th century. They controlled the leading sugar industry in Madeira already, but they wanted to gain another powerhouse production base in Brazil.Jones, Terry-Ann. \\"Challenges of Sugar Cane Production in Brazil: Human and Social Costs of Ethanol.\\" International Journal Of Environmental Sustainability 11, no. 1 (March 2015): 13-20. Environment Complete, EBSCOhost To start out, the crop was grown and produced by the indigenous people of the land for traded goods. That relationship evolved from trade to slavery of the indigenous population. Many places in the world had begun to substitute honey for sugar as a major commodity due to the supply increase and lower prices. Sugar became a luxury item on the world market because of it exploited coerced labor demand and the industrial organization that were both imperative to production.Tomich, Dale W. Slavery in the Circuit of Sugar, Second Edition : Martinique and the World-Economy, 1830-1848. Albany: SUNY Press, 2016. eBook Academic Collection (EBSCOhost), EBSCOhost The native population were not really adhering to the slavery aspect and were hard to keep under control, so as the market for sugar grew these factors caused the eventual import of African slaves.  The Engenho  Engenho Central dec 1930 The export boom of the late 18th and early 19th century cause a ramp up in the production of sugar and other sugarcane products as well as other resources. The sugar portion of the export boom increased supply until slavery was made illegal in the world. However, the slave trade continued into the latter part of the 19th century. Haiti's slave revolt allowed Brazil among other colonies to become the top producers of the world's sugar. In 1792, Haiti was producing 50% of the sugar on the world market, but after the rebellion they went to producing none the next year.ALLAHAR, ANT√ìN L., Verene A. Shepherd, and Hilary McD. Beckles. 1999. \\"Chapter 45: The Cuban Sugar Planters 1790-1820 \\"The Most Solid and Brilliant Bourgeois Class in all of Latin America.\\" In Caribbean Slavery in the Atlantic World, 621-632. JM: Ian Randle Publishers, 1999. History Reference Center, EBSCOhost They main location site the sugarcane work took place were large plantations called an Engenho. An Engenho is an agricultural establishment as necessary machines and resources for refining sugar from sugarcane. The facilities typically have a mill for milling cane, some cauldrons and distilleries. They acquired the name because of all their components used to produce and develop the sugarcane into potential exports.Antonil, Andre Joao, and Timothy Coates. Brazil at the Dawn of the Eighteenth Century. Lebanon: Tagus, 2012. eBook Academic Collection (EBSCOhost), EBSCOhost Engenhos could be considered revolutionary at the time because of its industrial advancement, the work combined manufacturing, chemistry, and agriculture to mass produce sugar. This new industrialized plantation required many working parts to keep it running. An engenho needed a field, workshop, refinery, and office just to produce the sugar. The list did not take account for the needs to power the building or slave requirements and needs. To run the Engenho specialized slaves and servants were necessary. The overseer had to be a free white, while the slaves purchased needed to be strong field hands and some already familiar with the sugar production process. They were sometimes imported from Sao Tome in Africa because of the country's history as major world sugar producers which allowed for the workers from there to already have the artisan skills needed for the sugarcane production.Otremba, Eric. 2012. \\"Inventing ingenios: experimental philosophy and the secret sugar-makers of the seventeenth-century Atlantic.\\" History & Technology 28, no. 2: 119‚Äì147. Computer Source, EBSCOhost These large sugar plantations required a new division of labor among the overseers and slaves. the overseers had power on the plantation but were not all powerful, the planter was. For example, the overseer could not just punish slaves however he wanted to, he had limitations. His main job was to make sure all the supplies needed where there and to keep a list of what the planter had to get. The overseer was to keep the slaves working and cared for, and also see that the steps in the sugar production were being done correctly. The process needed slaves for cutting, carrying, evaporation, and crystallization all in a compressed time frame due to the nature of the crop. To keep it running and all the parts working in the sugar producing business machine, a dramatic increase of laborers were needed. To make sugar, it was imperative that the sequence was nonstop from the cutting in the field to final export. An error in any stage could bring about drastic effects and ruin a batch of the harvested crop. The sugarcane would become rotten after twenty four hours from being cut, so time was of the essence and the workers could not afford to make mistakes. Production and slave labor could no longer be looked at as separate, they were dependent of one another when it came to the sugarcane cultivation and production. The making and exporting of this commodity was now dependent on the Atlantic slave trade. An aspect that made the engenho a different type of operation was its need of all the people involved from field slave all the way to chief overseer. Each division of labor had to perform and contribute to make the plantation a success. Also, the planter could not buy just any slave to get the job done, they needed to be skilled and knowledgeable about their specific roll in the sugarcane process. To achieve the necessary level of knowledge was no easy task. Training cost money, time, and resources. It would take up to a year or more for the sugar production to be learned due to the lengthy amount of time it takes sugarcane to grow and become ripe enough.

In RoadBlasters, the player must navigate an armed sports car through 50 different rally races, getting to the finish line before running out of fuel. Gameplay Arcade version screenshot The objective is to complete all 50 rallies without running out of fuel. The player's car is equipped with a cannon that can be used to destroy enemy vehicles and roadside gun turrets for extra points. A scoring multiplier is set to 1 at the start of each rally. Each time the player successfully strikes a target, the multiplier increases by one, up to a maximum multiplier of 10. After missing a target, the multiplier drops by 1. A helicopter occasionally flies overhead and drops a power-up item, which the player can pick up; these items have a limited number of uses. The player also encounters indestructible obstacles consisting of mines, boulders, floating \\"spiker\\" balls, and oil slicks, the last of which will cause the player to lose control for a moment if hit. The player's car has two fuel tanks, a main tank and a smaller reserve. If the main tank runs empty at any time, the car begins to use its reserve. Red (dropped by enemies destroyed from a distance) and green (appearing at specific milestones) globes on the road add small amounts of fuel to the main tank when picked up. Reaching the halfway point of a rally resets the main tank to the level it had at the start of that stage, but does not affect the reserve. At the end of each rally, the main tank is refilled and fuel is added to the reserve based on the number of points scored in that stage. Contact with any enemy, projectile, or obstacle other than an oil slick destroys the player's car, removes any power-up in effect, and resets the scoring multiplier to 1. The player loses a small amount of fuel while a replacement car is put on the road. There is no limit to the number of times that the player's car can be destroyed and replaced; the game only ends when both the main and reserve fuel tanks are exhausted. The player may continue as many times as desired during the first 49 rallies, but is given only one chance to play the 50th and final one. Completing this rally awards a bonus of one million points and ends the game. Promotions A promotional giveaway was accessible on the original arcade version, where players could send in their name and \\"personalized secret code\\" after completing rally 50 and receive a free RoadBlasters T-shirt. The promotion ended August 31, 1987. The game had a toy tie-in made by Matchbox. The toys were die-cast cars that could be customized with armor, lasers, machine guns, and rocket launchers and jet engines. There were two factions: Turbo Force and The Motor Lords. There also were play sets such as a mobile command base. Reception In a capsule review of the Lynx version for STart, Clayton Walnum praised the game's massive length and combination of \\"standard racing with heaps of action.\\" He added that \\"If you liked Roadblasters on another system, you won't be disappointed in the Lynx version.\\" CVG Magazine also reviewed the Atari Lynx version of the game, Julian Rignall went on to say \\"Roadblasters is a challenging game and is technically superb, with stunning graphics and great speech.\\" He said it was fun but the levels were frustrating finally giving it a rating of 76 out of 100. In a review of the Lynx version, Robert A. Jung concluded, \\"This is a mind-blowing awesome adaptation. I'd recommend it to most video-game players -- fans of driving games, fans of shooting games, fans of action games, and fans of the arcade original. It's a challenging, well-balanced arcade/action game, faithful to the original, worthy of the Lynx and offering lots of hours of fun. This goes right up there with Blue Lightning as one of the best Lynx games around.\\" He gave a score of 9 out of 10. Legacy The game appeared on the Sony PlayStation compilation Arcade's Greatest Hits: The Atari Collection 2 in 1998. It was also released for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube and PC as part of the Midway Arcade Treasures arcade game compilation. A port can be played in Lego Dimensions via an Arcade Dock in the level \\"The Phantom Zone.\\" The game made an appearance in the movie Wreck-It Ralph as the game Turbo, the main antagonist, tries to commandeer, but ends up crashing it (as shown in his backstory).

It sits off the A2 coast road between Cushendall and Ballycastle. It has a sheltered harbour and lies at the mouth of the River Dun and Glendun, one of the nine Glens of Antrim. The Mull of Kintyre in Scotland is only about 15 miles away across the North Channel and can be seen easily on clear days. In the 2001 Census it had a population of 138 people.NI Neighbourhood Information Service It is part of Causeway Coast and Glens district. The hamlet of Knocknacarry is nearby. History Cushendun Bridge Cushendun is where Shane O'Neill, chief of the Tyrone O'Neill dynasty, was killed by the MacDonnells in 1567. Cushendun village, was designed for Ronald McNeill, the Conservative MP and author later Lord Cushendun in the style of a Cornish village by the architect Clough Williams-Ellis. He is buried in the Church of Ireland graveyard near his nationalist cousin Ada or Ide McNeill, Roger Casement's friend and admirer who died in 1959. Since 1954 most of the village and the parkland around Glenmona to the north has been owned by the National Trust. Cushendun's picturesque coastal setting in the heart of the Antrim Coast and Glens Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, together with its architectural inheritance, resulted in designation as a Conservation area in 1980. People *Poet Moira O'Neill's home was across the bay from Cushendun. She was the mother of Molly Keane, the noted Irish writer. Robert Emmets GAC In 1904 Dominic Quinn, Daniel Black and Willie McLaughlin founded the first Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club in Cushendun known as the Brian Boru's. The club participated in the first Feis-na-nGleann in 1904 and after defeating Glenarm, lost to Carey in the final of the ‚ÄúShield of Heroes‚Äù. In 2004 the club celebrated its centenary in a large marquee located in the grounds of Glenmona House. Nicky Brennan (then president of the GAA) and other GAA dignitaries from throughout Ireland joined in the celebrations. During most of their existence Cushendun has been a junior hurling club but on a few occasions has moved up to the senior ranks. The club played Gaelic football in 1934 and 1972 but history and tradition in a small parish meant that the game was never popular and it failed to flourish for any significant period of time. The pinnacle of the club's achievements has been the winning of the All County Senior Championship in 1931. Since that date the Intermediate Championship has been won on three occasions-1973, 1992 and 2007. The Junior Championship was also secured in 1963 and again in 2018, along with several Feis competitions and leagues. Camogie has been played with a fair degree of success during several periods throughout the past century but has always been difficult to maintain. One of the major highlights of the club's history was the construction of the new pitch in 1967/68 followed by the building of the new pavilion which was officially opened by then president of the GAA Jack Boothman in 1995. A second floodlit pitch was added to the complex at Lig-na- Arigid Park in 1999.http://www.cushendungac.com/content/?id=7&l1id;=13 Trivia The nearby caves of Cushendun have been used as backdrop in the series Game of Thrones.

Following the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, Berkut has a history of illegal activities against Ukrainian citizens, such as racketeering, terrorism, physical violence, torture, anti-Ukrainian sentiment, voter intimidation against those who would elect non-Yanukovych candidates, and violence against protesters during Euromaidan and the Orange Revolution.Berkut Riot Police Used to Falsify Ukrainian Parliamentary Elections, The Jamestown Foundation (14 November 2012) The new government held Berkut responsible for most of the Heavenly Hundred civilian deaths, and acting Ukrainian Interior Minister Arsen Avakov signed a decree that dissolved the agency, which was replaced with the National Guard of Ukraine.Ukraine's new rulers disband riot police, Reuters (Feb 26, 2014)Head of Ukrainian Interior Ministry signs order to dissolve \\"Berkut\\" , Voice of Russia (25 February 2014)–ê–≤–∞–∫–æ–≤ —Ä–∞—Å–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏–ª \\"–ë–µ—Ä–∫—É—Ç\\" : –ù–æ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –£–ù–ò–ê–ù 26.02.2014  01:10 Crimean Berkut In March 2014, Berkut units stationed in the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol defected to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs during the annexation of Crimea by Russia, after the territories were approved as federal subjects.Russian interior bodies created in Crimea and Sevastopol , ITAR-TASS (25 March 2014)Crimean Berkut police to preserve name as it incorporates into Russian Interior Ministry, ITAR-TASS (24 March 2014)Ukraine: Speaker Oleksandr Turchynov named interim president, BBC News (23 February 2014) Ukraine protests timeline, BBC News (23 February 2014) Berkut effectively became an agency of Russia when units were allowed to preserve their old name, and now serve within the National Guard of Russia as the gendarmerie for Crimea.

Ukraine Berkut officers in 2007. =History= The Berkut was founded on January 16, 1992, three weeks after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, as the \\"Berkut\\" Separate Special Assignment Unit(s) of Militsiya to serve the newly independent Ukraine as the replacement of the Ukrainian SSR's branch of the Soviet OMON (Special Purpose Police Unit). The order to organize the OMON in the Ukrainian SSR had been issued on 28 December 1988, over a year after the establishment of the Soviet OMON back in 1987 and almost three months later after the issue of official order on October 3, 1988. The first OMON units in Ukraine were formed in Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Odessa, Lviv and Donetsk and were based on selected units of Soviet Internal Troops of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs. After Ukrainian independence, it was decided to organize OMON units in every oblast (province) center as part of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs. The new agency was fully implemented by the start of 1993, and inherited Ukrainian OMON's functions, including responsibility for high-risk police operations including hostage crises and riot policing, but primarily as a quick reaction force with a focus on combating organized crime. =Organization= football match. The Berkut was a reserve unit of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVS) and subordinates to the regional (oblast) departments of the MVS. Until 1997 it was under the direct supervision of HUBOZ (Chief Directorate in Fight of Organized Crime). Due to formation of another quick reaction force unit Sokil (Falcon) under HUBOZ, Berkut was later reassigned under the supervision of the Directorate of Public Security of the MVS. The main duty of the unit was the security of the general public and enforcement of civil order, especially during mass public events (demonstrations, parades, sport or concert events, etc.), or in places of increased criminal activity as part of the fight against organized crime. The Berkut have also been assigned to provide protective custody of certain individuals, such as witnesses in criminal trials. Berkut members were paid 1.5-2 times more than the average Ukrainian police officer. Depending on the region, the Berkut's units ranged in manpower from 50 to 600. Also depending on its dislocation, the unit could have been commissioned as a company or regiment. As of January 2008, the force consisted of two regiments, six separate battalions, and 19 companies totaling 3,250 members. –ú–í–° –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ –î–ó–ì –ú–í–° –£–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω–∏ 16.01.2008 One of the regiments is located in Kyiv, while another one is stationed in Crimea. During the Euromaidan protest movement Berkut members from more the pro-Euromaidan Western Ukraine complained to the media that they were \\"mistrusted\\" by top commanders. The Berkut militia were distinguished by their maroon berets (also known as \\"krapovy beret\\"), an honorary headgear. Standard Berkut equipment includes AKM assault rifles, PK machine guns, Dragunov SVD sniper rifles, UAZ-469 jeeps and the BTR-70 armoured personnel carriers. Some units are issued with the SPG-9 recoilless rifle and RPG-7 on a need basis. =Criticism= Political violence The Berkut increasingly developed a reputation for engaging in political- related violence, including acts of police brutality and extrajudicial punishment against anti-government protesters, activists, and voters. On 25 June 1995 during mass riots of Crimean Tatars who started so called \\"turf war\\" against Crimean gang \\"Bashmaki\\", policemen of \\"Berkut\\" from Poltava on the highway near Sudak, (Autonomous Republic of Crimea) open fire to kill from automatic weapon which resulted in seven people were wounded and two were killed.Volodymyr Prytula.

At that time Luhansk Oblast was governed by Oleksandr Yefremov and Viktor Tikhonov. In 2004 and 2005, Berkut teams participated in many actions of Leonid Kuchma's government against the opposition during the Orange Revolution. Former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych has been accused, including by Amnesty International, of using the Berkut to threaten, attack, and torture Ukrainian protesters. Upon coming to power, Yanukovych had reversed oversight measures established during the Yushchenko administration to curb Berkut abuse of citizens, whereupon the special force \\"upped its brutality.\\" =Euromaidan= On 30 November 2013, Berkut units in Kyiv violently dispersed protesters during the Euromaidan protest movement, and have since been involved in many other instances of brutality in suppressing the movement. On 27 January 2014, the Ministry of Defense announced sharp pay raises for military personnel,Twitter / OS1954: Defence ministry announces 5:29 AM - 27 Jan 2014 from Westminster, London and the Cabinet of Ministers adopted a secret resolution to increase the size of the Berkut force sixfold to 30,000; they would also be given more power and a reserve fund would be set aside for additional ammunition. Former head of Security for the Ukrainian president, General Viktor Ivanovich Palivoda, stated in early February 2014 that those officers standing in the front lines of riot control received pay bonuses, and that they received bonuses for capturing protesters, included added years of service.Ukrainian top general: There is proof of russian intervention in Ukraine  Uriks.no =Citizen disenfranchisement= The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe confirmed witness accounts of voters being blocked from access to polls and being attacked along with local election officials who tried to frustrate the Berkut's practice of falsifying voters' ballots in favor of Yanukovych's Party of Regions candidates. Individual cases have been reported of citizens grouping together and fighting back against the Berkut in order to preserve election integrity and results. =Anti-semitism= Bernard-Henri Levy noted that in its last days before the end of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and the Berkut's disbandment, on its website the group accused Euromaidan leaders of being Jewish; one accused was Ihor Kolomoyskyi. Berkut had posted a picture with a superimposed Star of David and Swastika in order to depict an alliance of Nazis and Jews against pro-Russians in Eastern Ukraine. Specific incidents Euromaidan anti-Berkut poster explaining difference between the Berkut and conscripted Internal Troops. Writing in Business Insider in February 2014, Harrison Jacobs noted: \\"The Berkut ... has had a long history of brutality, abuse, torture, and other measures in service of whatever political regime is in control of Ukraine.\\" According to Ukraine political expert Taras Kuzio in November 2013, in recent years the force had been increasingly used to intimidate anti-government demonstrators and to influence the electoral process. * 23‚Äì25 June 1995 ‚Äî Assaulted Crimean Tatars near Sudak (Crimea) and helped criminals to escape angry crowdSpark that almost burned down Crimea.

Many pro-Ukrainian Berkut servicemen opted to join the National Guard of Ukraine, which is partly composed of former Euromaidan activists, and began fighting alongside the regular Ukrainian Army against pro-Russian separatists in the concurrent War in Donbass. Russia =History= Five days before the dissolution of Berkut by the Ukrainian government, Russia began annexation of the Crimean peninsula and seizing control of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol. A sizeable Berkut unit had been stationed in Crimea, and took part in maintaining public order during the 2014 Ukrainian revolution and Euromaidan. Media and Euromaidan demonstrators had accused Berkut of being excessively violent during these events.Russia flexes military muscle as tensions rise in Ukraine's Crimea region, CNN (February 27, 2014)Berkut: Ukraine's protest-suppression unit, Deutsche Welle (10.12.2013 ) On 26 February 2014 the newly appointed Russian de facto mayor of Sevastopol, Alexei Chaly, announced the formation of a new Berkut special police force \\"in order to maintain public order in Sevastopol, to prevent unlawful acts of provocation, riots and looting.\\" Chaly then offered asylum to former Berkut troops in Ukraine, saying \\"These people adequately fulfilled their duty to the country, have shown themselves to be real men, and are now abandoned to the mercy of this rabid pack of Nazis. For faithful service, today criminal cases are brought against them. At this difficult time our city needs decent men who could form the basis of self- defense groups, and in the future the municipal police. We are ready to provide for them if they join us in our struggle, and to offer safety to their families.‚Äù On 28 February Russia started to issue pro-Russian Berkut members Russian passports in the city of Simferopol. By 21 March 2014, the date the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol were granted accession as federal subjects of Russia as a result of the referendum in Crimea, the Berkut units based in the territory were still active despite the agency being dissolved.https://web.archive.org/web/20140322113513/http://news.yahoo.com/ragtag- camp-grows-russias-frontier-201155946.html Three days later, Russia announced that the Berkut units in the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol would preserve their name and would be incorporated into the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. In June 2014, an armed pro-Russian separatist group fighting in Donetsk and Luhansk in the War in Donbass called the Donbass Veterans' Union claimed to be composed of \\"more than 1000\\" former Berkut officers and other former servicemen and police officers. On 5 April 2016, Berkut was transferred from the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs to the newly-created National Guard of Russia. =Organization= The Crimean Berkut unit has 400 members with subunits in Kerch and Yalta. Notes :A.The status of Crimea and Sevastopol is currently under dispute by Ukraine and Russia; Ukraine and the majority of the world consider Crimea an autonomous republic of Ukraine and Sevastopol one of Ukraine's cities with special status, while Russia, on the other hand, considers Crimea a federal subjects of Russia and Sevastopol one of its federal cities. Both are completely under Russian control.

History Faisal bin Abdul Aziz founded the school in Taif in the early 1950s. In 1964 Faisal opened a large campus for the school in Jeddah, and from that point forward, arranged an annual fund of several million Saudi riyals from the national budget. Kamal Adham, Faisal's Turkish father-in-law, traveled to the United Kingdom to meet officials from the government.

Some lower class Saudis were granted acceptance and attended the school with wealthier Saudis. Around that era, each graduating class consisted of around 60 boys. During that period many Egyptian and Syrian teachers, who had been involved in dissident Islamic organizations in their home countries, taught at Al-Thager, as many did in other Saudi primary and secondary schools and universities.Coll 144 Coll said in the 1960s and early 1970s that the school \\"had a relatively secular flavor.\\" Around the early 1970s many Al- Thager students engaged in political debates. One group of students, influenced by Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt, were in favor of Pan- Arab nationalism. Another group of students, influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood, were in favor of additional Islamic influence in politics in the Arab world.Coll 147 Coll said that Al-Thager was \\"a conspicuous example of modernization without secularization.\\"Coll 153 Campus In the 1960s the school campus was located near downtown Jeddah, with the campus north of Old Jeddah Road. A two story concrete and fieldstone building served as the school's main classroom building. Steve Coll, author of The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century, said that the building was in a \\"featureless modern style.\\" The school had two classroom wings, one for middle school students and one for high school students. An interior courtyard was located between the wings. In the 1960s most students were day students and commuted to school. The boarding students and some foreign teachers lived in dormitories on the school's second floor. In the 1960s Al-Thager was the only school in Jeddah to have air conditioning. Curriculum and discipline Steve Coll, author of The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century, said that in the 1960s and 1970s Al-Thager \\"prided itself on its modern curicculum\\" and that it was the only Saudi school that \\"could even begin to compare itself to a place like\\" Brummana High School in Brummana, Lebanon. During that period the school had English instruction provided by many foreign English teachers from England and Ireland. Al-Thager, like other Saudi schools, had religion as a core component in the instruction. At noon, the boys performed zuhr, the Islamic prayer at noontime.Coll 143-144 Each morning, the school prompted boys in a military-style call of order to assemble in rows. Teachers had canes, and disciplined boys by striking their feet. Dress code The students wear western-style school uniforms seen in American and British university preparatory schools; in most Saudi schools for boys, the students wear thobes and cloth headdresses. During the 1960s and 1970s, students wore white oxford shirts with ties, grey trousers, black socks, and black shoes. During winter periods students wore charcoal-coloured blazers. Notable alumni Osama bin Laden began attending Al-Thager in 1968, either in the fifth or sixth grade. Osama's education at Al-Thager ended in 1976.

In the film, Ku is a language spoken in the fictional African country of Matobo. The constructed language was created for the film by Said el-Gheithy, the director of the Centre for African Language Learning in Covent Garden, London. Commissioned by The Interpreter's director, Sydney Pollack, and Working Title Films, el-Gheithy adapted aspects of ShonaArticle on Language Log, April 21, 2005 and Swahili, languages spoken in Eastern and Southern Africa, to devise the basis of this fictional language. The language has its own internal dictionary and el-Gheithy created a whole culture and history in his mind.Article in the Los Angeles Times, April 27, 2005 In this context, the actual language spoken by the Tobosa people of the fictional Democratic Republic of Matobo, although known as 'Ku' to foreigners, is indigenously known as Chitob uk u which literally means 'the language of the Tobosa people'. Ch'itoboku, then, would be the only surviving ancient Bantu language, and the Tobosa oral traditions indicate that 'Ku' is the root of modern Bantu languages spoken in contemporary Sub-Saharan Africa. There is no gender distinction, hence the word for 'he' or 'she' is the same, 'a'. Verbosity is positively valued in Ch'itoboku, and ordinary speech should approximate the elegance of poetry. As with most African cultures, Tobosa customs are based on age and gender. Drawing on the historical tradition, elders greet younger generations first, and women speak before men. Greetings are essentially verbal, but are followed by a touching of foreheads. The most common expression in greeting is 'sonna', meaning 'hello', but a more energised greeting is kwambu, and the response is kwamb uk uu, 'and how are you?' There is not a single word for 'thanks,' but the word tenane is used to show appreciation and is expressed through the clapping of hands. Men clap with their palms and fingers together, while women clap with their hands across each other. During meetings and conversation, sneezing is an indication of disbelief. On leaving, one would say digai, which actually means 'you haven't gone for ever, we will see you again'. The person staying responds by saying '. The language and cultures of the Tobosa have been influenced by links with the outside world through colonialism and more recently as a result of processes of globalisation. For example, modern technology has become part of the modern 'Ku' vocabulary, and is now written and pronounced as Kompyutanga. Matobo is currently enjoying more prosperity, not from the usual gas and mineral resources, but rather from its special herbal tea, zingwe, drinking of which is believed to guarantee eternal youth.

In 1901 he participated in a Dutch solar eclipse expedition to Karang Sago, Sumatra. He was noted for his observations of variable stars, and published a number of papers on the subject in Astronomische Nachrichten, and elsewhere, from 1917 until 1936. He proposed naming variable stars in each constellation using a simple numbering system beginning with V1, V2, ... and so forth. However the double-letter system starting with RR was already in widespread use. As a result, variable stars after QZ were numbered according to Nijland's system beginning with V335. In 1923 Nijland became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. The crater Nijland on the Moon is named after him.

Much of her archaeological work was conducted in Egypt. She also went on expeditions in countries like Zimbabwe and South Arabia. Many of her contributions to the field of archaeology include a technique for excavating archaeological sites and information on Paleolithic to Predynastic civilizations in Zimbabwe and Egypt. Caton Thompson held many official positions in organizations such as the Prehistoric Society and the Royal Anthropological Institute. Early life Gertrude Caton Thompson was born to William Caton Thompson and Ethel Page in 1888 in London, England, and attended private schools in Paris and in Eastbourne, including the Links School, run by Miss Hawtrey. Her interest in archaeology began on a trip to Egypt with her mother in 1911, followed by a series of lectures on Ancient Greece given by Sarah Paterson at the British Museum. An inheritance received in 1912 helped ensure her financial independence and support her later excavations. Caton Thompson's first experience in the field came in 1915 working as a bottle washer in an excavation in France. During World War I, she worked for the British Ministry of Shipping as part of which she attended the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. In 1921 Caton Thompson embarked on studies at University College London where she was taught by Margaret Murray, Flinders Petrie and Dorothea Bate, excavating in Upper Egypt during the winter of that year .Caton Thompson, G.C. 1983. Mixed Memoirs. Gateshead: Paradigm Press, p.82 The following year she began attending courses at Newnham College, Cambridge, before joining further excavations in Egypt with Petrie and Guy Brunton in 1924. Work in Malta In 1921, along with Margaret Murray, Gertrude Caton Thompson helped in the excavation of the megalithic temple of Borg en Nadur near St. George's Bay in Malta. Her responsibilities included investigating the caves near the temple searching for neanderthal skulls as evidence for a land bridge between Malta and the continent of Africa. Though she did not find evidence to support this theory, the excavation yielded other notable artifacts, such as Bronze Age pottery that closely paralleled Sicilian styles of the same period. Work in Egypt During the 1920s she worked as an archaeologist, primarily in Egypt for the British School of Archaeology Egypt, although she also conducted fieldwork in Malta. In Egypt she participated in excavations at a number of sites including Abydos,Petrie, W.M.F. 1925. Tombs of the Courtiers and Oxyrhynkhos. London: British School of Archaeology in Egypt. Badari,Brunton, G. and Caton-Thompson, G,C. The Badarian Civilisation and Predynastic Remains Near Badari. London: British School of Archaeology in Egypt. and Qau el Kebir.Petrie, W.M.F. 1930. Antaeopolis. The Tombs of Qau. London: British School of Archaeology in Egypt. Caton Thompson took a special interest in all aspects of Prehistoric Egypt and was one of the first archaeologists to look at the full-time spectrum from the Palaeolithic through to Predynastic Egypt.Weedman, K. 2001. Who's \\"that girl\\": British, South African and American Women as Africanist Archaeologists in Colonial Africa (1860s‚Äì1960), African Archaeological Review 18(1), p.11 Caton Thompson not only found a number of archaeological artifacts from Egypt, she also organized their display in the Egyptian Exhibition in England. Many of these finds are now in the British Museum's collection.British Museum Collection While working in the Badari region 1923‚Äì24 she took the initiative to explore prehistoric settlement remains at Hemamieh. Caton Thompson's work at the site was distinguished by its meticulousness. Caton Thompson began her work by organizing the site into ten by thirty foot intervals. She carefully excavated in arbitrary six-inch levels, and recorded the exact position of each artifact.Brunton, G. and Caton Thompson, G.T. 1928. The Badarian Civilisation and Predynastic Remains Near Badari. London: British School of Archaeology in Egypt. pp.70‚Äì74. Along with her excavation techniques, Caton Thompson was also the first to use air surveys to locate archaeological sites. Such approaches to excavation were in many respects a generation ahead of her time and \\"sets her apart from her contemporaries and the majority of her successors\\".Hoffman, M. 1991. Egypt Before the Pharaohs. Austin: The University of Texas Press, p.139. In 1925 Caton Thompson and the geologist Elinor Wight Gardner began the first archaeological and geological survey of the northern Faiyum, where they sought to correlate ancient lake levels with archaeological stratification. Caton Thompson found the earliest farming civilization to date in the Fayum region of Egypt, estimated to about 4000 B.C. They continued working in the Faiyum over the next two years for the Royal Anthropological Institute where they discovered two unknown Neolithic cultures. Caton Thompson and Wight Gardner also worked on prehistoric sites at Kharga Oasis in 1930. Her publication of \\"Kharga Oasis in Prehistory\\" was the first publication of the new Athlone Press of the University of London. Also the flints she was allowed to bring back to London are permanently housed in the Institute of Archaeology in London. This led to research more broadly on the palaeolithic civilizations of north Africa, which Caton Thompson published in 1952.Caton Thompson, G. 1952. Kharga Oasis in Pre-History. London Caton Thompson made her first visit to the Kharga Oasis in 1928 during her expedition to the Zimbabwe excavations. There were three expeditions to the Kharga Oasis from 1930 to 1933. Elinor Gardner did the surveying for many of the excavations. Caton Thompson had to excavate only for Paleolithic artifacts because there was such a variety of prehistoric civilizations at the Kharga Oasis including Neolithic artifacts. Caton Thompson determined that the Kharga Scarp contained water without rainfall, which helped to supply water to a Neolithic civilization. Since the Kharga Scarp contained many Paleolithic sites, she was able to excavate many implements used by those civilizations. Great Zimbabwe In 1928, the British Academy invited Caton Thompson to investigate the origins of ruins in southeastern Zimbabwe near Lake Mutirikwe. The site contained three sets of structures which contained multiple buildings. Known since the 16th century, Great Zimbabwe had been previously excavated by James Theodore Bent and David Randall-MacIver and controversy raged as to whether the site was the work of Africans (MacIver's view) or of some other civilisation. Caton Thompson assembled an all female expedition for the Zimbabwe excavations, which was the first of its kind. Caton Thompson used ceramics, which were similar to what modern villagers were using, and structures like terrace walls to determine who built the structures from the site. Working with Kathleen Kenyon, Caton Thompson's excavations led her to the unequivocal view that Zimbabwe was the product of a \\"native civilisation\\". The assertion attracted considerable negative press attention and was received negatively by many within the archaeological community. Caton Thompson claimed to keep hostile letters from local experts in a file marked \\"insane\\". Modern archaeologists now agree that the city was the product of a Shona-speaking African civilisation. Later life In 1932, she employed Mary Leakey to illustrate her book The Desert Fayum, greatly influencing her later career in paleoanthropology. Towards the end of 1937 Caton Thompson and Elinor Gardner, accompanied by Freya Stark, initiated the first systematic excavation in the Yemen at Hadhramaut. However, relations between Caton Thompson and Stark were notoriously strained, with Stark deriding an anonymous but identifiable female archaeologist in her book A Winter in Arabia in 1940. Caton Thompson retired from fieldwork after the Second World War. A long time friend of Dorothy Hoare, a colleague from Cambridge, Caton Thompson bought and shared a house with Hoare. After Hoare married Jose \\"Toty\\" M. de Navarro, another Cambridge lecturer in archaeology, the Navarros continued to share the house with Caton Thompson. When she and the Navarros retired from academic life in 1956, Caton Thompson moved with them to their home in Broadway, Worcestershire - Court Farm. Caton Thompson went on to have her memoirs release as an autobiography entitled \\"Mixed Memoirs\\" in 1983. She would reside with them and their son, Michael for the rest of her life. She died in 1985, in her 97th year at Broadway, Worcestershire.  Honours and accolades  In 1938 she was offered the post of Disney Professor of Archaeology at Cambridge but rejected the role which was subsequently accepted by Dorothy Garrod. However, she was a research fellow at Newnham College, Cambridge in 1923 and honorary fellow from 1934‚Äì45, receiving an honorary LittD in 1954. She was the first female President of the Prehistoric Society from 1940 to 1946, whilst also being elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1944. Caton Thompson was also elected to the vice presidency of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1944. She received the Huxley Medal from the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1946. In 1934 Caton Thompson was also the first woman to receive the Rivers Medal from the Royal Anthropological Institute. In 1961 she was a founding member of the British School of History and Archaeology in East Africa and was made an honorary fellow after serving on the council for 10 years.

She first appeared in September 1972 in which she has a fight with her husband, Clinton, over her rights as a woman. She finds that her recently acquired feminist beliefs clash with his idea of how a wife should behave, and she promptly walks out on him and her two children. She catches a ride with Mike Doonesbury and Mark Slackmeyer, who happen to be traveling cross-country on motorcycle at the time, and travels with them back to Walden Commune. There she spends several years living with the other characters while running a day- care service for local children (whose parents often aren't too thrilled when their little girls come home talking about Women's Rights). While running Walden Day Care, Caucus sends off applications to several real-life law schools (whose actual students petitioned the schools to accept her as a student). She eventually accepts an offer from Boalt Hall for the class of 1977, and moves to California. She shares an apartment with Ginny Slade while there, and helps Ginny in an unsuccessful bid for the United States Congress. After becoming a lawyer, Joanie spends many years working for Congresswoman Lacey Davenport, and marries Rick Redfern, a reporter with the Washington Post. She also reconnects with her daughter J.J., whom she hasn't seen since leaving her family. Joanie feels incredibly guilty over this, but she and J.J. eventually reconcile. Joanie later works for the Justice Department, is an aide during the Clinton Presidency, and has since gone into private practice. In the 1980s she gives birth to Jeff Redfern while in Lamaze class. Joanie is one of the more down to earth characters of the strip. She had an almost maternal relationship with the others at the commune, and appears to have moderate political beliefs. She works for Davenport despite the fact that Lacey is a Republican and Joanie is a Democrat, considering that Lacey's upstanding character is more important than her politics. On March 3, 1974 Joanie, applying to law school, gives her birthdate as July 21, 1935 but in a January 2009 appearance, Joanie describes herself as a 70-year-old retired civil servant born in 1938. She and Rick Redfern still live in Washington DC. Starting in the fall 2011 Joanie worked as volunteer coordinator for the real- live candidate Elizabeth Warren's campaign to unseat Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown.

It became extinct after World War II, due to extermination of most of its speakers in Nazi concentration camps.  Speakers  Before their extermination in the 1940s, speakers of Bohemian Romani, the Bohemian Romanies, were one of several nomadic populations of Bohemia. They led a peripatetic (or semi-peripatetic) way of life, travelling around the country (especially during the warmer seasons of the year) and offering their services to the sedentary population of the Bohemian countryside. They were mostly horse-dealers, peddlers, tinners, and entertainers. The first ancestors of Bohemian Romanies probably arrived in Bohemia in the 16th and 17th centuries, from Slovakia via Moravia. Small-scale migration of Romanies from Slovakia to the Czech Lands (as well as backwards) continued throughout the following centuries. The Bohemian Romanies have always been a numerically insignificant minority. In 1939, there were ca. 6,000 people of different Romani groups in the territory of today's Czech Republic (Neƒças 1995). Of these, a smaller fraction, perhaps some 2,000 people, lived in Bohemia. The proportion of different Romani groups in this figure is unknown, though the estimate of 500-1,500 of Bohemian Romanies cannot be wildly off the mark. Other Romani groups in Bohemia, who spoke different dialects of Romani than the Bohemian Romani, included the Sinti and a few families of the Kalderar (or Kaldera≈°) Roma. The Sinti appear to have been the first Romani group to be established in the region, some of them arriving from southeastern Europe as early as in the 15th century; they mostly inhabited the German-speaking parts of Bohemia. The Kalderar, on the other hand, were relatively late newcomers, having had migrated from Wallachia in the second half of the 19th century. In addition, there were also several non-Romani peripatetic groups in Bohemia, who spoke Czech or German or argots based on these languages. The self-ethnonym of Bohemian Romanies was simply Rom (plural Roma). They were called \\"Hungarians\\" by the Sinti; this probably reflects their origin in Slovakia, which was then part of Hungary. They were called \\"Poles\\" (Poljako, plural Poljaƒça) by the Kalderash, which is one of the ethnonyms the Kalderar use to refer to different Romani groups. The sedentary population referred to all peripatetic groups, including Bohemian Roma, as \\"gypsies\\": cik√°ni in Czech or Zigeuner in German. In the early 20th century, Bohemian Romani was, at least in some groups of Bohemian Roma, gradually becoming a non-native ethnic language, acquired in late childhood and used mostly for secretive purposes (cf. Lesn√Ω 1916: 214‚Äì216, L√≠pa 1960: 50). Clearly, a development had started toward a Para-Romani variety, that is, a specialized non-native variety spoken by Roma, which has the grammar of a majority language (Czech in this case) as well as an access to Romani-derived lexicon (El≈°√≠k 2003: 44). The Nazi genocide of Roma and Sinti in the 1940s brought about radical death of all Romani dialects of pre-war Bohemia, including Bohemian Romani. Only ca. 600 (i.e. 10% of) Czech Roma and Sinti survived the genocide (Neƒças 1995), including perhaps a hundred of Bohemian Roma. Bohemian Romani ceased to be used by the survivors due to a complete social disintegration of their communities, and they ceased to transmit the language to their children. The last known speaker of Bohemian Romani died in the 1970s (Hana ≈†ebkov√°, p.c.). The historical group of Bohemian Romanies must be distinguished from those Romanies groups that live in Bohemia presently. The latter are post-World War II immigrants from Slovakia (especially Romungro), who do not speak Bohemian Romani.  Dialect classification  Bohemian Romani belongs to the North Central dialect group of Romani. It is most closely related to Moravian Romani and West Slovak Romani, together with which it forms the Western subgroup of North Central Romani. Although clearly a North Central dialect, Bohemian Romani also shares a few features with the Sinti dialects of Romani. In some cases, these are due to diffusion from Sinti into Bohemian Romani. While Bohemian Romani would have been intelligible to speakers of other North Central dialects, there is evidence that there was no inherent intelligibility between Bohemian Romani and Sinti.  Lexicon  Bohemian Romani shares with other dialects of Romani much of its Indo-Aryan vocabulary as well as numerous early loanwords from Western Iranian languages (Persian and/or Kurdish), Armenian, Ossetic, and Greek. In addition, it shares with the other North Central dialects of Romani the layer of loanwords from South Slavic languages, Hungarian, and Slovak. Finally, the most recent loanwords originate in Czech. Examples of loanwords * West Iranian: \\"ring\\", \\"luck\\", \\"whip\\" * Armenian: \\"handful\\", \\"horse\\" * West Iranian or Armenian: \\"forehead\\" * Ossetic: \\"shoe, boot\\", \\"trousers\\" * Greek: ' \\"anvil\\", \\"cabbage\\", \\"seven\\", \\"town\\", \\"fruit tree\\", \\"freeze\\" * South Slavic: caklo \\"glass\\", doha \\"enough\\", dugo \\"long\\", duma \\"speech\\", viƒçin- \\"shout\\" * Hungarian: \\"spider\\" (< \\"beetle\\"), \\"noon\\", \\"freeze\\" * Slovak: \\"inn keeper\\" * Czech: \\"sea\\" * Slovak or Czech: \\"grave\\", \\"friend\\" (< \\"nation\\")  See also  * North Central Romani * Romani people * Romani Holocaust  References  * Boretzky, Norbert. 1999.

Vortex lift has an additional vortex close to the body when shed by a leading edge root extension or closer to the tip when shed by a sweptback leading edge. Vortex lift is that portion of lift due to the action of leading edge vortices.Aircraft Performance and Design, John D. Anderson,Jr., Tata McGraw-Hill Edition 2010,, p.100 It is generated by wings with highly sweptback, sharp, leading edges (beyond 50 degrees of sweep) or highly-swept wing-root extensions added to a wing of moderate sweep.\\"Why's And Wherefore's Of Wings\\", B.R.A. Burns, Air International magazine, February 1979, p.82 It is sometimes known as non-linear lift due to its rapid increase with angle of attack.https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670003842.pdf and controlled separation lift, to distinguish it from conventional lift which occurs with attached flow. How it works Vortex lift works by capturing vortices generated from the sharply swept leading edge of the wing. The vortex, formed roughly parallel to the leading edge of the wing, is trapped by the airflow and remains fixed to the upper surface of the wing. As the air flows around the leading edge, it flows over the trapped vortex and is pulled in and down to generate the lift. A straight, or moderate sweep, wing may experience, depending on its airfoil section, a leading-edge stall and loss of lift, as a result of flow separation at the leading edgeDesign For Air Combat, Ray Whitford 1987, , p.16 and a non-lifting wake over the top of the wing. However, on a highly-swept wing leading-edge separation still occurs but instead creates a vortex sheet that rolls up above the wing producing spanwise flow beneath. Flow not entrained by the vortex passes over the top of the vortex and reattaches to the wing surface.NASA TM X 2626 The vortex generates a high negative pressure field on the top of the wing. Vortex lift increases with angle of attack (AOA) as seen on lift~AOA plots which show the vortex, or unattached flow, adding to the normal attached lift as an extra non-linear component of the overall lift.Design For Air Combat, Ray Whitford 1987, , Fig.81 Vortex lift has a limiting AoA at which the vortex bursts or breaks down. Applications Four basic configurations which have used vortex lift are, in chronological order, the 60-degree delta wing; the ogive delta wing with its sharply-swept leading edge at the root; the moderately-swept wing with a leading-edge extension, which is known as a hybrid wing; and the sharp- edge forebody, or vortex-lift strake.Design For Air Combat, Ray Whitford 1987, , Fig.87 Wings which generate vortex lift have been used on delta-winged research aircraft such as the Convair XF-92A and Fairey Delta 2. Early delta wing fighters such as the Convair F-102, the F-106 and Century Series contemporaries such as Dassault's deltas had cambered leading edges that were blunt and did not generate significant vortexes. The Concorde supersonic airliner had sharp leading edges. Wings with vortex lift over the inboard section are the moderate-sweep wings with an easily identified LERX used on high-manoeuvrability combat aircraft, such as the Northrop F-5 and McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet. Vortex lift sharp forebody strakes are used on the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. <gallery widths=\\"200px\\" heights=\\"150px\\",class=\\"center\\" > File:Akaflieg DM 1.jpgLippisch DM-1 test glider, 64-degree delta which demonstrated vortex lift in wind tunnel when modified with sharp leading edge at NASA Langley Research Center in 1946 File:Eclipse program QF-106 aircraft in flight, view from tanker.jpgF-106 , a 60-degree delta: an early example with leading edge flow separation File:Concorde on Bristol.jpgConcorde showing its ogive delta wing with high sweep angle at wing root: a highly developed shape with controlled flow separation File:J-3005.jpgNorthrop F-5 a wing with moderate sweep: an early application of vortex lift using a LERX File:F-16 June 2008.jpgGeneral Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon vortices from sharp-edged wide forebody stabilize flow over entire aircraft including outboard wing Benefits and shortcomings Vortex lift provides high lift with increasing AoA at landing speeds and in manoeuvring flight. A high AoA needed to meet landing requirements has, in the past, restricted pilot visibility and led to design complications to accommodate a drooping nose, as in the case of the Fairey Delta 2 and Concorde. For moderate swept wings the addition of a LERX reduces wave drag and improves turning performance and enables a far wider range of flying attitudes.Design For Air Combat, Ray Whitford 1987, , p.89-91 The use of vortex lift is restricted by vortex breakdown or bursting and an inherent instability in yaw . There is considerable drag due to increased lift production and loss of leading edge suction that is part of normal attached flow round a leading edge.https://www.icas.org/ICAS_ARCHIVE/ICAS1988/ICAS-88-4.5.2.pdf Among animals Animals such as hummingbirds, and bats that eat pollen and nectar, are able to hover. They produce vortex lift with the sharp leading edges of their wings and change their wing shapes and curvatures to create stability in the lift.

It is located on the River Slaney near the border with County Carlow and County Kildare, on the N81 road. Etymology The town's Irish name, Bealach Conglais means \\"the way of Conglas\\". It was the name of a palace at Baltinglass, where, according to the Irish etymologist Patrick Weston Joyce, the powerful Leinster king Branduff resided in the sixth century. Conglas was a member of the mythological warrior collective, the Fianna. A nineteenth-century explanation is found in Samuel Lewis' A Topographical Dictionary of Ireland, where he says that the name, \\"according to most antiquaries,\\" comes from Baal-Tin-Glas, meaning the \\"pure fire of Baal,\\" and that this suggests that the area was a centre for \\"druidical worship\\". The detailed study, The Place-names of County Wicklow by Liam Price provides several variations of the town name from the 12th century Book of Leinster, through King King Henry VIII's state papers, to the 17th century Down Survey. Previous Irish-language names for the village bring to mind its monastic past. These, as mentioned in two 17th-century works, are Mainistear an Bhealaigh and Mainister an Beala. The first of these, Mainistir an Bhealaigh, has been the name used since the beginning of the independent Irish state. History The surrounding hills of the area is rich in archaeological and historical sites, including the Rathcoran passage structure. On the highest point of the Baltinglass Hill, north-east of the village, the passage grave from the Stone Age whose outer walls are finished in chalk not native to the area, is said on bright days to be visible from Kildare's Curragh away. To the north end of the village on the weir of the River Slaney lies the ruins of an ancient monastery, Baltinglass Abbey, that has had many additions over the centuries; the original church is said to date from around 700 A.D. The medieval Viscounts Baltinglass were from the Hiberno-Norman Eustace family, who also founded Ballymore Eustace. Their estates later passed to their cousin Sir Maurice Eustace, Lord Chancellor of Ireland 1660-1665. Sir Maurice did much to promote the development of the town, building a church, a school and a bridge, and encouraging new settlers. The town gained national attention in 1950 when the replacement of a local postal worker, Helen Cooke, led to accusations of political cronyism nationally and a local row which became known as the 'Battle of Baltinglass'. The town centre mainly lies east of the river, along Main Street and ending at Market and Weavers Square. West of the river, the town is located around the N81/R747 crossroads, along Edward Street, Mill Street and Belan Street. Quinn's superstore is a landmark site on Mill Street to the North of the town. Apartments and weir on the River Slaney in Baltinglass Baltinglass has a number of natural, archaeological and built heritage sites; such as Baltinglass Hills, Baltinglass Abbey and St. Mary's Church, the River Slaney Special Area of conservation and a number of buildings of architectural and historical merit, several of which are located in the town centre. In the 20 years between the 1996 and 2016 census, the population of the town almost doubled from 1,127 to 2,137 people. Culture Statue of Michael Dwyer Baltinglass has featured in film and theatre, being the location for the 1974 movie of Brian Friel's play Philadelphia, Here I Come! starring Donal McCann and Siobh√°n McKenna. It was also the location of the workhouse in Sebastian Barry's play The Steward of Christendom. Sport The local Gaelic Athletic Association club, Baltinglass GAA, has several pitches and teams. One of their early successes was the 1912 Junior title. In 1927 they won the Wicklow Senior Hurling title. 1958 saw Baltinglass win the Wicklow Senior Football Championship for the first time and, in 2020, they won their 23rd such title. In 1990 the club claimed the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship. Transport =Rail= Baltinglass railway station opened on 1 September 1885, as part of the line from Sallins to Tullow. It closed to passengers on 27 January 1947 and to goods traffic on 10 March 1947, and closed altogether on 1 April 1959 along with the rest of the line. The site is now mainly occupied by a livestock mart, although the station building remains intact. =Bus= Bus services are available to Carlow via Rathvilly and Tullow, twice daily Mondays to Fridays. This route is operated by JJ Kavanagh and Sons, and it stops in Baltinglass outside Burkes shop, to pick/drop off passengers. Bus √âireann route 132 provides a once-a-day, each- way commuter link to Dublin via Tallaght on the same days. There are also a limited range of Bus √âireann Expressway services (usually one or two journeys a day each way) linking Baltinglass to Dublin, New Ross, Waterford and Rosslare Europort, while Thursdays-only route 132 provides a link to and from Carnew.

Some patent laws require the payment of maintenance fees for pending patent applications. Not all patent laws require the payment of maintenance fees and different laws provide different regulations concerning not only the amount payable but also the regularity of the payments. In countries where maintenance fees are to be paid annually, they are sometimes called patent annuities. Rationale Research is indicating that renewal fees can be used to improve the innovation incentives generated by patent rights.Reported by Professor Mark Schankerman, Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics, cited in Jeremy Phillips, \\"Strategies to Improve Patenting and Enforcement\\", IPKat, 29 May 2008. Consulted on June 1, 2008. International treaties =Paris Convention= Article 5bis of the Paris Convention requires that parties to the Convention should provide a six-month grace period for paying maintenance fees:Article 5bis of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property: All Industrial Property Rights: Period of Grace for the Payment of Fees for the Maintenance of Rights; Patents: Restoration :(1) A period of grace of not less than six months shall be allowed for the payment of the fees prescribed for the maintenance of industrial property rights, subject, if the domestic legislation so provides, to the payment of a surcharge. :(2) The countries of the Union shall have the right to provide for the restoration of patents which have lapsed by reason of non‚Äìpayment of fees. =Patent Cooperation Treaty= International patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty are not subject to the payment of maintenance fees. However, maintenance fees may fall due to designated/elected national and regional offices. If renewal fees have become due by the time the national phase starts, they must be paid before the expiration of the time limit applicable for entering the national phase.Paragraph 21 of the PCT Applicant‚Äôs Guide ‚Äì Volume II ‚Äì National Phase National and regional legislations =Canada= In Canada, maintenance fees for a patent application, or a patent issued from the application, are due on each anniversary of the filing date of the application, beginning on the second anniversary. The amount due each year escalates during the life of the patent or patent application. If the maintenance fee is not paid (by the applicant or agent of record) by the due date with respect to a patent application, the application is deemed abandoned. The abandoned application may be reinstated within 12 months of the date of abandonment, by filing a request for reinstatement with payment of the maintenance fee that is due and the reinstatement fee. The maintenance fee for a patent may be paid within a one-year grace period after the due date, with the payment of a late fee. If the required fee has not been paid when the grace period expires, the patent lapses. =China= No annuity (maintenance) fees need to be paid while applications are pending.SIPO web site, http://english.sipo.gov.cn/laws/lawregulations/201101/t20110119_566244.html Once granted of the patent maintenance fees are due based on the anniversary of application date. The unpaid fees while the patent was pending have to be paid on grant. =European Patent Office= Renewal fees are payable to the European Patent Office in respect of pending European patent applications in respect of the third year from the date of filing. These fees are paid in advance of the year in which they are due (such that the renewal fee for the third year falls due two years from the date of filing) and fall due on the last day of the month containing the anniversary of the date of filing. (formerly ). Renewal fees may not be validly paid more than three months before they fall due, except for the third renewal fee which can be paid up to six months before its due date (in accordance with amended Rule 51(1) EPC in force since April 2018).: \\"Renewal fees\\". If the payment of a renewal fee for a European patent application is not made in due time, the renewal fee may still be validly paid within 6 months of the due date, provided that the additional fee provided by is paid within the 6 months as well. (formerly ) For the calculation of the 6-month additional period, the so-called de ultimo ad ultimo rule is applied by the EPO. According to this rule, the six-month period runs \\"from the last day of the month to the last day of the month\\".Decision J 4/91 of October 22, 1991, Legal Board of Appeal 3.1.1 of the European Patent Office. Published in OJ 8/1992, 402. For instance, if a renewal fee was due in February 2004, the additional fee fell due on August 31, 2004 (Tuesday), i.e. 6 months from the end of February 2004. The obligation to pay renewal fees terminates with the payment of the renewal fee due in respect of the year in which the mention of the grant of the European patent is published. Subsequently, renewal fees are payable to the national offices of the EPC Contracting States in which the European patent is brought into effect. Each Contracting State then pays the European Patent Organisation a proportion of each renewal fee received for a European patent in that State. Whereas for a pending European patent application an applicant must pay a single maintenance fee at the EPO, it may be much more costly to pay several maintenance fees to the several national patent offices for maintaining a granted European patent in a number of countries. This however depends on the number of countries in which the patent proprietor wants to maintain its European patent into force. For instance, whereas, as of April 2010, the renewal fee was 1420 euros for the 10th to 20th year at the EPO,Supplement 1 to Official Journal 3, 2010, Schedule of fees and expenses applicable as from 1 April 2010 the sum of national renewal fees exceeded respectively 7 000 euros and 20 000 euros for the 10th and 20th year. =Italy= In a widely criticised move the Italian Parliament approved the cancellation of all maintenance fees due for Italian patents (including European patents validated in Italy), utility models and designs, as from January 1, 2006. Although the fees were reintroduced on January 2, 2007, the actual amounts of the fees were not announced until April 6, 2007. Consequently, for any fees that fell due between January 2, 2007 and April 30, 2007, the time limit for paying these was extended to June 30, 2007. Official decision: www.gazzettaufficiale.it, DECRETO 2 Aprile 2007 Determinazione dei diritti sui brevetti e sui modelli, in attuazione del comma 851, dell'articolo 1, della legge 27 dicembre 2006, n. 296.

Some, including Roland Grossenbacher, then chairman of the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation, considered that the abolishment of annuity fees in Italy was an error, because, if annuities were abolished, \\"all patents would remain in force up to the 20th year.\\" Managing Intellectual Property, Fees may rise as EPO stresses quality (Interview: Roland Grossenbacher), February 1, 2008 =United Kingdom= The United Kingdom does not require renewal fees to be paid in respect of pending applications but a granted patent must be renewed on the 4th anniversary of the filing date and every year after that.Renewing your patent section on UK Patent Office website and Rule 39 of the Patents Rules 1995 (as amended) Historically, and in contrast to most other European countries and the European Patent Office, the law in the United Kingdom required that renewal fees be paid on the anniversary of the filing date rather than on the last day of the month. Following amendments made by the Patents Act 2004, the The Patents (Amendment) Rules 2005, which came into effect on 1 October 2005, ensured that any period prescribed for payment of a renewal fee does not expire until the end of the month in which the renewal date falls. =United States= Maintenance fees on utility patents in the United States are due 3¬Ω, 7¬Ω and 11¬Ω years after grant of the utility patent.35 USC 41(b)(1) No maintenance fees are due while an application is pending.USPTO FY 2009 FEE SCHEDULE Design patents and plant patents are not subject to maintenance fees at all.

MPEP ¬ß 2506. the patentee must wait until the payment window opens six months before the due date before paying a maintenance fee. At the end of the half-year window during which a maintenance fee may be paid, a six-month grace period begins during which a patentee may still pay the maintenance fee along with a small surcharge (as of 2016: $160 for a large entity, $80 for a small entity; and $40 for a micro entity) in order to maintain the patent.37 C.F.R. ¬ß 1.362; MPEP ¬ß¬ß 2501, 2504. If the maintenance fee has not been paid at the conclusion of the grace period, the patent expires for non-payment of maintenance fees.

History Originally launched in 1973 as the official magazine of the British Computer Society and published by Haymarket Publishing, Computing is the longest continuously published magazine for IT professionals in the UK. It is largely a controlled circulation publication, mailed without charge to members of the British Computer Society and other accredited workers in the field of computing. A small minority of issues are sold on newsstands, with the bulk of funding for production arising from advertising. It was one of two magazines (the other being Accountancy Age) that were purchased in the 1970s by Dutch publisher VNU Business Media to launch their business in the UK. VNU Business Publications was acquired by Incisive Media in 2007. Along with Computer Weekly (and formerly IT Week), Computing is the mainstay of the UK computer industry trade press. Historically, Computing was aimed at business-focused readers, with Computer Weekly catering for readers seeking more technical coverage. This distinction blurred and dissolved in the late 1980s, with IT Week filling the gap left in technology-focused business coverage from 1998, but in recent years Computing has once more pursued a business-oriented agenda since IT Week was bought by VNU Business Publications to create complementary publications. The Computing web site was relaunched with new video and audio content and a focus on extensive reader interactivity in early 2007. About a dozen regular bloggers were introduced to create dynamic content for the online version of the magazine, some of these blogs also being carried in the print title. The editor contributes a regular blog. The long-term editor of Computing, Bryan Glick, left the title in November 2009 to pursue a new role as editor-in-chief of Computer Weekly.

The parish was established in 1884 by Joseph A. Byron under the direction of John McCloskey, Cardinal, Archbishop of New York, for the Germans and Irish of the newly developed neighborhood to the east of Third Avenue near the East River. The area had been served by St. Paul's Church on East 117th Street and by St. Cecilia's on East 106th Street. Since both older parishes were some distance from the newer settlement along the river, it was inevitable that the rapidly developing area would see the founding of two ethnic churches: Our Lady of Mt. Carmel on 115th St. for the Italians and Our Lady of the Holy Rosary on East 119th St. for the Germans and the Irish.Augustinian Archives, Holy Rosary Parish, New York City. The new parish was placed under the patronage of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary. A 35-year-old New Yorker, Joseph A. Byron, was appointed as first pastor with neither a church nor a rectory. He conducted a door-to-door census of his prospective parishioners seeking their support for his plan to create a church of their own. In March 1884, he purchased four lots on East 119th Street, between First and Pleasant Avenues, where the present parish buildings stand. Michael Corrigan, Coadjutor Archbishop of New York, presided over the dedication of the new church on Rosary Sunday, October 5, 1884. The address previously listed in older records for the same church building was 442 E 119th Street.The World Almanac 1892 and Book of Facts (New York: Press Publishing, 1892), p.390. Byron and his two assistants, Charles A. Meridith and James T. McGovern, lived in a rented house at 365 Pleasant Avenue until the completion of the present rectory. On March 29, 1893, Byron, 44, died from a cold caught during the building of the new rectory. Francis H. Wall, another native New Yorker, assumed the pastorship of Holy Rosary in 1894. He encouraged the establishment of Rosary Society, Sacred Heart League, Holy Name Society, St. Vincent de Paul and Young Men's Lyceum. The year 1898 saw the rise of the present stone church that Corrigan dedicated on Feb. 11, 1900. Sports became part of parish life, and the Boys Club was set up in 1903. When William J. Guinan succeeded Wall in 1909, he established a training course for CCD teachers. Thomas F. Kane became pastor in 1916. He got the support of the Pallotine Sisters who had begun in 1908 St. John's Settlement at 361-371 Pleasant Avenue. Staffed at the time by nine Sisters, it counted 42 girls and 35 boys as its wards. From 1918 to 1925, two separate congregations existed in the same building. Kane and his two Irish assistants maintained the regular parish upstairs while Gaetano Arcese, assisted by several Italian priests, maintained the Italian one downstairs. The increasing Italian population in East Harlem had made it necessary to provide a priest at Holy Rosary who spoke their language. Arcese was chosen to minister to them in the lower church. Arcese, a native of Alpino, Italy, came to the United States at 17 years of age and studied for the priesthood at St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie. He was named monsignor in 1937 and as prothonotary apostolic and ecclesiastical superior to the Pallotine nuns in 1943. He arranged for the training of the nuns at Fordham University and for their teaching accreditation. He likewise moved St. John's Settlement, a children's home, to smaller quarters. In 1949, he opened the Holy Rosary School to an initial enrollment of 160 pupils with the help of two Sisters. Upon the death of Arcese in 1953, Bonaventure Filitti from St. Patrick's Old Cathedral replaced him. Filitti added a wing to the parochial school and embellished the interior of the church and the rectory. Two years later he was transferred to Our Lady of Grace Parish in the Bronx. Salvatore Cantatore, who had served as curate for six years under Arcese, was installed pastor in 1956. One of the significant developments taking shape during this period was the influx of Spanish-speaking immigrants around East Harlem. The first to serve their specific needs was Robert Banome who, prior to his priestly ordination, had worked in Puerto Rico. From 1968 to 1969 the pastor was Raphael Lombardi. In 1975, the School of Mt. Carmel under Terzo Pavis, a Pallotine and pastor of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Parish, was merged with the Holy Rosary School under Pavis. In 1975, masses were said in English, in Spanish and in Italian. There were evening devotions to Our Lady of Miraculous Medal, Our Lady of Perpetual Help and St. Anthony. Various organizations flourished, including Senior and Junior Legions of Mary, Holy Name, St. Anne and Sacred Heart societies, Senior and Junior Sodalities of Our Lady, St. Therese and St. Aloysius, Fathers and Mothers Clubs, St. Vincent de Paul, Boys and Girls CYOs, Boy and Girl Scouts, drum and bugle corps, choir, altar boys and ushers. There was a CYO Center next to the rectory. School enrollment rose to 727 and the number of faculty members to 16. In 1976, Ronald Ciaravolo was appointed pastor. Renovation and painting of the church marked his term. Two years later, the Parish was entrusted by Terence Cooke, Archbishop of New York, to Nicanor L. Lana, former rector of the University of San Agustin in Iloilo City, Philippines, administered at the time by Augustinian friars affiliated to the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines. When Lana was recalled by his religious superiors to head the Augustinian house in Neguri, Bilbao, Spain, Angel S. Dulanto succeeded him. Gilbert Luis R. Centina III was nominated pastor by Carlos F. Moran, Augustinian Father Provincial on Sept. 20, 2006. He was appointed pastor of Holy Rosary Church by Edward Egan, Archbishop of New York, on Dec. 1, 2006. Buildings Byron purchased the site of the present church in March 1884, and soon learned of a recently vacated and unused church building that had formerly served the parishioners of St. Cecilia's. He arranged to have the building dismantled into its separate building materials, transported those materials by wagon to the banks of the East River, and then floated upstream to East 119th Street, where they again were hauled by wagon to the site purchased for Holy Rosary. All through the summer of 1884, parishioners and laborers reassembled old St. Cecilia's. On Rosary Sunday, October 5, 1884, Michael Corrigan, Coadjutor Archbishop, presided over the dedication of the church. In the spring of 1898 a small chapel was built on 122nd St. and the church demolished. On Rosary Sunday, auxiliary bishop John Murphy Farley laid the cornerstone for the new church which was designed by architect Thomas Houghton in Byzantine-Romanesque style. The church was dedicated February 11, 1900. The church was renovated and repainted in 1976 during the pastorship of Ronald Ciaravolo. =Adaptive reuse= In June 2016, Catholic Charities established the Holy Rosary- Stabilization Bed program at Holy Rosary's former convent. The program provides comprehensive case management services to residents, formerly homeless adults with severe mental illness and substance abuse addiction.Victoria-Kline, Jacqueline. \\"How We House the Hardest-to-Help Homeless\\", Catholic Charities, December 18, 2017  Pastors  *1884‚Äì1892: Joseph A.

This Milwaukee neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Today, the Third Ward is home to over 450 businesses and maintains a strong position within the retail and professional service community in Milwaukee as a showcase of a mixed-use district. The neighborhood's renaissance is anchored by many specialty shops, restaurants, art galleries and theatre groups, creative businesses and condos. It is home to the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design (MIAD), and the Broadway Theatre Center. The Ward is adjacent to the Henry Maier Festival Park, home to Summerfest. The district is bounded by the Milwaukee River to the west and south, E. St. Paul Ave to the north, and N. Jackson St. to the east. History The content of this video includes the Milwaukee Public Market, local businesses, graffiti, and memorials located in the Historic Third Ward.During the early years of Milwaukee, the Third Ward was a relatively flat, swampy area. The land was drained, and soon houses populated the west side of the Ward, while along the east side of the Milwaukee River, factories and warehouses were built. Irish immigrants were the early settlers of the area. The Ward became known as the \\"Bloody Third,\\" a reputation the area earned for its frequent fistfights. The first railroad linked Milwaukee to the Mississippi River in 1856, letting wholesalers supply needed goods to the population of settlers in the West. The Irish settlers in the Third Ward went through two major tragedies. On September 7, 1860 the Lady Elgin steamship left Milwaukee carrying a large number of passengers from the Third Ward's Irish community. Over 400 people are believed to have died when the ship sank and is the second greatest loss of life seen on the Great Lakes. A Wisconsin Historical Marker in the Third Ward commemorates the tragedy while a monument dedicated at Calvary Cemetery serves as a cenotaph. After the fire of 1892The second tragedy struck on October 28, 1892. A fire started by spontaneous combustion at the Union Oil & Paint Co. building along the Milwaukee River at Water Street. Strong winds of up to 50 mph helped to spread the fire to the Ward's other buildings. The fire quickly grew out of control. With Cities such as Chicago, Kenosha, Racine, Sheboygan and Oshkosh sent horse-drawn units by rail to help Milwaukee's fire department fight the flames. A total of 440 buildings were destroyed and more than 1,900 people, mostly Irish families, were left without homes by the time the fire was finally under control at midnight. Those families sought shelter in the Third Ward School, the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, and the old St. Gall‚Äôs Church housed hundreds overnight. Victims also received meal tickets to restaurants and clothing. Prominent local architects stepped in to design many of the commercial structures after the 1892 fire. Over the next 36 years construction continued, giving the buildings an interesting continuity that unifies the neighborhood because of this relatively short time of development. Italian immigrants replaced the Irish during this period of reconstruction, and the Irish had moved to different areas in the city. The Italians were very prolific in the warehouse businesses, establishing Commission Row, a grouping of grocery commission houses. By 1915, 29 Italian saloons, 45 Italian groceries, an Italian bank and two spaghetti factories populated the Ward. Grocery warehouses, liquor distributors dry goods businesses and manufacturers were the business that flourished during this time. Highway construction displaced the close-knit Italian Third Ward community in the 1960s. The trucking industry and suburb growth led to the decline of warehouse operations and industry. Ironically, Milwaukee's first architectural landmark was named in 1967, the Blessed Virgin of Pompeii Catholic Church, the same year it was demolished for construction of the I-794 freeway. In 2000, the Historic Third Ward Association began co-sponsoring Milwaukee's premier art event, Gallery Night and Day, a quarterly event which attracts thousands of visitors to the neighborhood. The Historic Third Ward recently experienced an influx of upscale women's boutiques, restaurants and high-end furnishings businesses. The Milwaukee Public Market also offers year-round indoor gourmet and specialty food shopping. In 2010, Erie Street Plaza, a small park and public space built on a former parking lot, opened on the southern edge of the neighborhood, near the confluence of the Milwaukee River and Kinnickinnic River.http://landscapeperformance.org/case-study-briefs/erie-street-plaza In 2019, murals by two European artists appeared in the area. First, two murals by French artist MTO were commissioned on private property, spotlighting endangered species. ' Later the same summer, the iconic mural \\"The Unsung Hero\\" by German artist Case Maclaim was commissioned by Singerman Real Estate for the PH Dye Building. The six-story mural is visible from Highway 794 and is now a Historic Third Ward tourist attraction.

Historic District In 1984 a cluster of the Third's historic warehouses and industrial buildings built from 1892 to 1928 was designated a NRHP historic district. It is bounded by the Milwaukee River, I-94, and some modern warehouses and parking lots to the east. Here are some contributing structures: * The Wirth, Hammel & Co. Sales stable at 167 N. Broadway is a 2-story cream brick horse stable designed by Henry C. Koch and built in 1892 on the site of the same company's previous stable, which had burned in the fire. The stable sold draft, saddle and carriage horses, and sold horses to logging operations in the fall - claiming to be the largest sales stables in the U.S. The basement and first floor could handle 150 horses at a time and the second floor provided sleeping quarters for men and storage. By the 1920s the business was called M.D. Newald's Sons & Co. and was transitioning to auto sales and service. * The Milwaukee Fire Department Engine Company #10 at 176 N. Broadway is a 3-story red brick structure with a cast iron cornice, designed by Sebastian Brand in Queen Anne style and built in 1893 to replace the earlier fire station, which was destroyed by the fire of 1892. * The National Distilling Co. at 221 E. Buffalo Ave. is a 4-story office building designed by Crane & Barkhausen in Romanesque Revival style and built in 1893. This building was probably offices, showrooms and storage for the firm which had a distillery in the Menomonee Valley. During Prohibition the name changed to Red Star Yeast and the company produced industrial alcohol, vinegar and yeast. M.A. Lichter Co. bought the building in 1963, for offices, and assembling and showing drapes. * Wellauer & Hoffman Co. at 232 N. Broadway is a 6-story structure designed by Henry C. Koch & Co. in Romanesque Revival style and built in 1893-94. Wellauer & Hoffman were wholesale grocers, coffee roasters, and specialty jobbers. By 1908 David Adler & Sons Co. was manufacturing men's clothes in the building. By 1932 the first two floors housed a furniture showroom and the third housed Columbia Knitting Company's manufacturing. Alley view of Commission Row, before renovation in 2005 Commission Row, after renovation as lofts in 2007 * The Ludington Estate Commission Houses at 301-315 N Broadway is a 3-story brick structure designed by Henry C. Koch & Co. and built 1894 to 1895. On a Friday morning in 1910, 145 wagons were counted in front of the block at one time. Served as a center of wholesale groceries, fruit and flower distribution into the 1980s, at least. * Roundy, Peckham & Dexter Co. at 241 N. Broadway is a 6-story warehouse designed by Howland Russell and built in 1895, with walls of painted red brick with terra cotta trim. The firm started in 1872 as a wholesale grocer. The firm's store on Broadway and Buffalo was destroyed in the fire of 1892, and was replaced by this building. Here the firm imported and jobbed staples and fancy groceries, packed grains and cereals, repacked herring, and roasted coffee and peanuts. In 1952 the firm renamed itself Roundy's Inc. Baumbach Building, built 1899 * The Baumbach Building at 302 N. Broadway is a 5-story Chicago Commercial-style factory designed by Eugene R. Liebert and built in 1899. It originally housed Cohen Bros., which manufactured and sold clothes for lumberjacks and miners. By 1916 the Phoenix Knitting Co. used it, by 1946 Midwest Lamp & Novelty Co. American Candy Co., built 1902 * The American Candy Co. at 191 N Broadway is a 7-story building designed by Charles Crane with red brick walls trimmed in terra cotta and stone and built in 1902 and expanded in 1906. The candy company was the original occupant, making cream almonds and assorted mixed candy, but known for its \\"Rex\\" fine chocolates. Milwaukee Mirror and Art Glass Works shared the building from 1908 to 1918. Boston Store used it as a warehouse starting in 1941, and Pro-Pac starting in 1945, for processing war materials. From 1950 to the 2000s Rauschenberger Co. made twine, cord, and hair goods here. * The Pabst Brewing Co. Saloon and Boarding House at 124 N Water St. is a 2-story brick structure designed by Charles F. Peters. * The E.R. Godfrey & Sons Co. at 402 N. Broadway is an 8-story building built in 1911, with brown brick trimmed in glazed yellow brick and terra cotta. Godfrey Co. was a grocery wholesaler that claimed to be the first in the lower Third Ward to combine wholesale groceries and fresh fruit and produce. They also claim to be the first to ship bananas in to Milwaukee. They roasted Silver Buckle brand coffee on the eight floor of this building. In 1926 James Godfrey founded IGA supermarkets and in 1953 this firm founded the Sentry grocery chain. Starting in 1949 Bruce Publishing, a printer of Bibles, occupied the building, then another religious firm, then LoDuca, which imported, exported, and retailed musical instruments. * The Marine Terminal Building Warehouse at 120 N. Broadway is a 3-story warehouse designed by Albert Hecht of Chicago and built in 1917-18. It is located on the Milwaukee River, with good access to roads, Lake Michigan, and the downtown, having served as dock, warehouse, and offices for various businesses. Education The school district is Milwaukee Public Schools.

His reign is summed up by Justo P√©rez de Urbel's description of him as \\"the poor king tormented in life by the sword of Almanzor and in death by the vengeful pen of a bishop,\\" Pelagius of Oviedo (died 1153), half of whose Chronicon covers the reign of Bermudo and is highly critical of the king.Jos√©-Luis Mart√≠n (1965), \\"Pelayo Rodr√≠guez, obispo de Santiago (977‚Äì985)\\", Anuario de estudios medievales, 2, 474 n47: el pobre rey atormentado en la vida por la espada de Almanzor y en muerte por la pluma vengadora de un obispo. He accuses Bermudo of imprisoning Bishop Gudesteus of Oviedo in the 990s and blames the attacks of Almanzor on Bermudo's sins.Simon Barton and Richard A. Fletcher (2000), The World of El Cid: Chronicles of the Spanish Reconquest (Manchester: Manchester University Press), pp. 72‚Äì73. Reign In 982 the Galician nobility proclaimed Bermudo, a son of former king Ordo√±o III of Le√≥n, as king in opposition to his cousin Ramiro III. This usurpation is usually seen as the extension of ongoing succession crises begun in the 950s. At the time of the usurpation Bermudo II's faction was led by Gonzalo Men√©ndez and that of Ramiro III by Rodrigo Vel√°zquez. Bermudo was crowned in the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela on 15 October 982. It is probable that two episcopal opponents of his coronation‚ÄîRodrigo's son Pelayo, then bishop of Santiago, and Arias Pel√°ez, bishop of Mondo√±edo‚Äîwere exiled from their sees to the monasteries of Celanova and San Mart√≠n de Lal√≠n, respectively, at this time.Emilio S√°ez S√°nchez (1946), \\"Notas al episcopologio minduniense del siglo X\\", Hispania, 6(22), 47‚Äì8 n180. Because his support was limited and regional Bermudo required the protection of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba. There was much unrest in Castile in his early years and the Cordoban armies of Almanzor came, not as allies, but as conquerors.J. M. Ruiz Asencio (1968), \\"Campa√±as de Almanzor contra el reino de Le√≥n (981‚Äì986)\\", Anuario de estudios medievales, 5, 31‚Äì64. Between November 991 and September 992 Vermudo was expelled from the kingdom by a revolt led by the magnates Gonzalo Verm√∫dez, Munio Fern√°ndez, and count Pelayo Rodr√≠guez. He was soon restored and reconciled to the discontents.Jaime de Salazar y Acha (1989), \\"El conde Fernando Pel√°ez, un rebelde leon√©s del siglo XI\\", Anuario de estudios medievales, 19, 87-97. On 8 August 994 Bermudo gave the village of Veiga to the monastery of Celanova, the village having been built by Suario Gundem√°rez on land illegally appropriated from the monastery. Suario took refuge there during his later rebellion.Antonio Palomeque Torres (1948), \\"Episcopologio de la Sede de Oviedo durante el siglo X\\", Hispania sacra, 1:2, 295. On 23 August that year the village of Morella was granted to abbot Salvato of Celanova after it was confiscated because the murder of Fort√∫n Vel√°zquez had taken place there. Bermudo eventually succeeded in recovering Zamora from the Muslims, but did not succeed in expelling them totally until 987. This brought on the reprisals of Almanzor, who set out to destroy Coimbra. After the latter besieged and razed the city of Le√≥n, Bermudo took refuge in Zamora. The Muslims continued their conquests, taking Astorga (996) and sacking Santiago de Compostela (997). In 999, the gout from which he suffered was aggravated and it became impossible for him to ride a horse. Military leader of Christians of northwestern Spain, he subsequently travelled by litter. Later that same year he died in Villanueva del Bierzo and was buried in the Monastery of Carracedo. Later, his remains were transferred to the Basilica of San Isidoro. Family =Parentage= Both the paternal and maternal parentage of Bermudo II have been subject to scholarly debate. On the paternal side, the primary chronicle sources simply call him son of king Ordo√±o, without specifying which former king of that name. Traditionally his father has been identified as Ordo√±o III and the modern consensus agrees with this assignment, but at least one prominent modern Leonese historian, Manuel Carriedo Tejedo, has concluded that he instead was son of Ordo√±o IV.Manuel Carriedo Tejedo (1981), \\"La Version de la \\"Historia Silense\\" Sobre la Filiacion de Vermudo II\\", Tierras de Le√≥n: Revista de la Diputaci√≥n Provincial, 21(44), 38-44. The question is seemingly resolved by a charter in the cartulary of Santa Mar√≠a de Carracedo, in which Bermudo names his father Ordo√±o and his grandfather Ramiro, making his father Ordo√±o III and not Ordo√±o IV, the son of Alfonso.Jaime de Salazar y Acha, \\"Reflexiones e hip√≥tesis sobre algunas inc√≥gnitas geneal√≥gicas de la antigua dinast√≠a astureonesa\\", Bolet√≠n de la Real Academia de la Historia, 210(2), 275-296. Controversy also exists over the identity of his mother. Traditionally he has been viewed as son of Ordo√±o III's documented wife, Urraca Fern√°ndez. Bishop Pelagius relates that Bermudo was born to a second wife of Ordo√±o, named Elvira, but since no such queen appears in charters or any other record outside of the Bishop's account, she probably did not exist. In a royal charter dated 5 January 999, Bermudo refers to his avo (grandfather, or by extension, ancestor), the count Gonzalo Bet√≥tez of Deza. As Bermudo's traditional pedigree would provide no such relationship, Justo P√©rez de Urbel suggested that he was instead an illegitimate son of Ordo√±o III, with the relationship coming through his mother. Based on political considerations and a second ambiguous documented kinship, he provisionally identified the mother as either Aragonta or Guntroda, daughters of Pelayo Gonz√°lez, count of Deza, who was son of count Gonzalo.Justo P√©rez de Urbel (1949), \\"Los Padres de Vermudo II el Gotoso\\", Revista de Archivos, Biblotecas y Museos 55, 289-307. He has been followed in this by several historians, but others find the evidence lacking and retain the traditional view of his mother. The identification of Bermudo's first queen, Velasquita Ram√≠rez, as a grandniece of count Pelayo allows the possibility that Bermudo was referring to count Gonzalo as ancestor of his wife and not his own blood ancestor,Manuel Rub√©n Garc√≠a √Ålvarez (1960), \\"¬øLa Reina Velasquita, nieta de Muniadomna D√≠az?\\" , Revista de Guimar√£es 70, 197-230. but he was already divorced from Velasquita at the time he executed the charter in question. =Children= By his first wife, Velasquita Ram√≠rez, Bermudo left a daughter, Cristina, who married Ordo√±o Ram√≠rez, son of his rival Ramiro III. Vermudo married secondly Elvira Garc√≠a, daughter of the Castilian count Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez, with whom he had three children: Alfonso, who succeeded him; Theresa; and Sancha. He also had three bastards: Elvira, Pelayo, and Ordo√±o, who married Fronilde, daughter of the aforementioned count Pelayo Rodr√≠guez. References Further reading *M.

Currently, RGRTA oversees the daily operation of eleven subsidiaries under the parent company of the RGRTA, including paratransit services. Organization The RGRTA is guided by a 14-member board of commissioners (two of which are vacant). The management team is headed by CEO Bill Carpenter, who reports to the board. In 2017, the RGRTA had operating expenses of $116.51 million and a level of staffing of 1,045 people. History =Rochester Railway Company= Public transportation in the greater Rochester area can trace its roots back to the streetcar and interurban lines operated by the Rochester Railway Company and later New York State Railways. In 1929, New York State Railways entered receivership, and local interests formed a plan to reorganize the former Rochester Railway. After several years of negotiation, the New York State Public Service Commission approved a reorganization plan in 1937 put together by attorney Howard Woods and his committee of stockholders. =Rochester Transit Corporation= On August 2, 1938, Rochester Transit Corporation assumed operation of the bus and streetcar operations serving the city. The last streetcar line was converted to bus operation in 1941, though contract operation of the city-owned Rochester Subway continued until 1956 (RTC ended freight operations in the Subway by 1957, transferring the responsibility to the connecting railroads). The company was returned to local control in 1943 when the remaining shares owned by Associated Gas & Electric were bought out. =From Private to Public= A 1990 Orion V bus With postwar prosperity came increased use of automobiles and the spread of population out to the suburbs. Rochester Transit Corporation was plagued by labor unrest, and strikes in 1952 and 1965 ground the system to a halt. A dispute over job listings and seniority caused a brief two-day strike in May 1967. With the transit workers contract coming to an end that fall, stalled negotiations led to another strike in November 1967. The work stoppage continued through the holiday season, and with no end in sight, the City of Rochester drew up a plan to condemn and purchase the transit company operations. Over the objections of RTC, the strike came to an end on January 25, 1968, and the city contracted with National City Management Company to operate the bus lines as Rochester Transit Service. Rochester-Genesee Regional Transportation Authority (RGRTA) was formed in 1968 by a state act of government which also formed three similar agencies in Syracuse, Buffalo, the Capital District around Albany and New York City. The RGRTA took over the former RTC bus operation from the City of Rochester and later began expanding bus service to outlying suburban and rural areas. The lines that made up the former RTC service became part of the Regional Transit Service (RTS) in Rochester and Monroe County.http://www.rgrta.com/aboutus.aspx  Regional Transit Service  125px The largest subsidiary of the RGRTA, Regional Transit Service (RTS) serves Monroe County (Rochester and its immediate suburbs) as well as providing service to students at Monroe Community College and Rochester Institute of Technology. Students in the Rochester City School District are also served. Suburban and park-and-ride routes serve the outlying towns in Monroe County and surrounding counties of Genesee, Livingston, Ontario, Orleans, Seneca, Wayne and Wyoming, including service into Avon, Victor, Lyons, and Le Roy. RTS also serves major shopping centers and malls in Monroe County, such as various Walmart locations, Marketplace Mall in Henrietta, Eastview Mall in Victor and The Mall at Greece Ridge in Greece. =Bus routes= Regional Transit Service operates a number of individual routes, most of which operate on a hub and spoke system from Downtown Rochester. These routes originate at the RTS Transit Center (Pictured Below) at 60 St. Paul Street along Mortimer Street. Prior to November 28, 2014, the opening date of the transit center, routes originated from the corner of Main and Clinton or from Broad Street. The Main and Clinton stops had been in place since 1863. With the move came a change in routes, stops and times including the elimination of through-routing, in which a bus would operate between two or more different routes during scheduled runs. Routes are color coded with those in green serving the east side of the county and those in blue serving the west side. ROC-It routes are routes with limited stops.

The Governor is appointed by the monarch on the official advice of Her Majesty's Government (HMG). The role of the Governor is to act as the de facto head of state as well as the de jure head of government and commander-in-chief of the territory, which consists of the islands of Saint Helena and Ascension and the group of islands of Tristan da Cunha. His or her responsibilities include internal security, external affairs, the administration of justice, finance, shipping, and employment and disciplinary action in respect of any public officer. The Governor is based on Saint Helena and is represented by resident Administrators, appointed by HMG, on Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha. He or she also appoints Saint Helena's Executive Council, and, with some exceptions, is bound to seek and act in accordance with their advice. The Governor has his/her own flag in Saint Helena, the Union Flag defaced with the territory's coat of arms. The official residence, Plantation House, is located near the capital Jamestown, and the Governor's office is located within The Castle, along with the office of the Chief Secretary, who runs the day-to-day administrative part of the government. Before 2009 the territory was known as \\"Saint Helena\\", of which Ascension and Tristan da Cunha were dependencies. A new constitution which came into force in 2009 changed the name of the territory to \\"Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha\\"; however, the Governor's title remained as the \\"Governor of Saint Helena\\".The St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009 Part 3 of the Constitution (in the Schedule to the Order) The Governor of Saint Helena nonetheless is the British monarch's representative across the territory.  Acting Governor and the Governor's Deputy  Under the St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009, an Acting Governor is appointed when the office of Governor is vacant or the Governor is unable to fulfil his or her duties long term. The Acting Governor is appointed by Her Majesty The Queen. If the Governor is off the island for a short time (including when s/he visits Ascension or Tristan da Cunha) or is ill for a short period, s/he may appoint anyone on St Helena to be Deputy. The Deputy must follow any instructions issued by the Governor. It is current practice to appoint an Acting Governor when the Governor is away from the island of Saint Helena, even if visiting either Ascension Island or Tristan da Cunha. In recent years the Chief Secretary (or in his/her absence, the Attorney General) has taken on this temporary role in the Governor's absence, the most recent times being in January 2011 when the Governor travelled to Tristan da Cunha and the Chief Secretary became Deputy GovernorSt Helena Independent 21 January 2011, see page 8 and then later in 2011 when Kenneth Baddon, the Attorney General, became Deputy Governor.

A symmoriiform chondrichthyan braincase and the origin of chimaeroid fishes. Nature. doi: 10.1038/nature20806 which lived from the Late Devonian to Late Carboniferous epoch, dying out around 298.9 million years ago. Fossils have been found in Asia, Europe and North America. Etymology Stethacanthus comes from the Greek œÉœÑ·øÜŒ∏ŒøœÇ (stƒìthos), meaning \\"chest\\", and ·ºÑŒ∫Œ±ŒΩŒ∏ŒøœÇ (akanthos), meaning \\"spine\\" or \\"thorn\\". The name refers to the distinctive anvil-shaped first dorsal fin and spine displayed by mature males of the genus. Description Size of S. productus Stethacanthus was about long, and in many respects, had a shark-like appearance. However, it is best known for its unusually shaped dorsal fin, which resembled an anvil or ironing board. Small spikes (enlarged versions of the dermal denticles commonly covering shark skin) covered this crest, and the ratfish's head as well. The crest may have played a role in mating rituals, aided in clamping to the belly of larger marine animals, or been used to frighten potential predators.Elasmo-research Like other members of Stethacanthidae, Stethacanthus had unique pelvic girdles, single-crowned and non-growing scales, a pectoral fin composed of metapterygium with an accompanying ‚Äòwhip‚Äô attached and a distinctive first dorsal fin and spine, termed the spine-brush complex. The neurocranium had a narrow suborbital shelf, a broad supraorbital shelf, a short otico-occipital division, large orbits, and cladodontic teeth that aligned precisely. In addition to these features, Stethacanthus also had male pelvic claspers with non-prismatic calcified cartilage at the distal ends. = Spine-brush complex = Restoration of a S. altonensis pair The spine-brush complex occupies the same site as the first dorsal fin on other ratfish and contains a basal plate extending inside a usually posterior-pointing dorsal spine composed of trabecular dentine. The spines resemble those of modern sharks and rays but curiously lack any enamel-like surface tissue. The trabecular dentine contains patches of fibers suggesting attachments to the epaxial musculature. The way these muscles would have been positioned implies that the spine could have been moved in anterio-posterior direction. The so-called \\"brush\\" is not fibrous as was originally believed, but consists of a number of parallel, membranous tubules made of globular calcified cartilage. The brush base and basal plate are covered in a thin, acellular bone layer. Zangerl asserts that these tubules are similar to erectile tissues in humans, and thus the complex may have been inflatable. The complex itself is covered in up to nine rows of large denticles pointing anteriorly. The dorsal side of the head has its own collection of denticles which point posteriorly. The presence of these large denticles has led to theories that the spine-brush complex in combination with the denticles on the head was used to scare away predators by simulating the mouth of a larger fish. The complex has been affirmed only in males, and only in those males that have reached sexual maturity. Whether the complex was present in females of the species is still unknown. Another theory for the spine-brush complex is that it was involved either in attracting a mate or in the mating process itself. =Pectoral fin whip= The pectoral fins of Stethacanthus were composed of the triangular-shaped metapterygium observed in modern-day sharks, but had an additional long, metapterygial structure called a fin whip. These fin whips contain at least 22 axial cartilages and extended past the pelvic fins. The three most anterior axials are shorter than the more posterior axials. The purpose of the fin whips is unknown but it has been suggested that they were used during mating. =Teeth and denticles= The tooth files are whorl-shaped and the palatoquadrate is scalloped with 6-7 recesses to allow for the tooth families. The individual teeth are widely separated from each other in the tooth whorls. The teeth themselves are of the cladodont variety; the bases of the teeth are broadest on the lingual side, and each support a single large cusp and two pairs of smaller accessory cusps for a total of five cusps. The medial and most lateral cusps are the most fluted. The teeth appear to be mostly orthodentine, but when viewed in cross- section, change abruptly to osteodentine. The enameloid is single-layered, overlaying the thick mantle of orthodentine. In addition to the dentition teeth, there are also a number of buccopharyngeal denticles lining the oropharynx. The denticles lining the top of the head and the top of the spine- brush complex are larger than the dentition teeth, and they appear as elongate monocuspid denticles. =Pelvic girdles and claspers= In Stethacanthus, the pelvic girdles consist of sheets of prismatic cartilage, each in the shape of a subtriangular, rounded plate. The anterior edge of each girdle is slightly concave while the posterior is convex. There appears to be no union of the two plates. There are two types of pelvic girdles found in stethacanthids: the primitive condition and the derived condition. In the primitive condition, the pelvic girdles have a metapterygial element supporting only one or two radials and most of the fin radials are attached directly to the pelvic plate. The derived condition differs in that there is a much higher number of radials supported by the pelvic plate. This feature, accompanied with a broadening of the pelvic girdle in order to accommodate the increased number of radials is a characteristic of Stethacanthus and other symmorriids. The males had claspers that were club-shaped at the distal ends and composed of non-prismatic globular calcified cartilage. =Caudal fin= There was some caudal fin variety among Stethacanthus species; while some had low angle heterocercal tails, some had tails approaching homocercal. The broad hypochordal lobe was supported by long, splayed fin radials. Paleobiology Restoration of S. productus with prey It is certain that Stethacanthus was a carnivore, and considering its small size probably fed on small fish, brachiopods, and crinoid ossicles like other sharks of its time. Additionally, as the spine- brush complex is rather a large structure, it seems likely that, in combination with the forward-facing denticles on the structure, it would have produced a drag force during fast locomotion. Therefore, Stethacanthus was probably a slow-moving shark. The fins of Stethacanthus were also smaller than in of the same size, and their teeth were also on the small side relative to other small Paleozoic sharks, suggesting that Stethacanthus may have been a bottom-dweller. Considering that most of the Stethacanthus specimens were recovered in the Bear Gulch Limestone in Montana, it is possible that this area was not only a breeding ground for other sharks but also for Stethacanthus, suggesting that they were migratory. History The several species of Stethacanthus discovered in the late 1800s were established based solely upon isolated spines, which initially confused paleontologist John Strong Newberry into thinking the spines constituted a new kind of fin. He originally believed that the spines were part of the pectoral fins and that they were not bilaterally symmetrical. Meanwhile, the first associated skeletal remains found in the Mississippian of Montana and the Devonian and Mississippian of Ohio remained undescribed for nearly a century. Since complete skeletons were extremely rare, Stethacanthus classification was vague and based on few characteristics. It was not until 1974 that the family Stethacanthidae was defined by Richard Lund because Stethacanthus differed so greatly from other Elasmobranchs of the time. Relative classifications of symmoriids compared to stethacanthids are still debated. More Stethacanthus specimens have been discovered, expanding their range from the Midwestern United States to the Lower Carboniferous of Bearsden, Scotland and the Lower Tournaisian of the Tula Region of Central Russia and ChinaN. Wang, J. Fan & W. Wang - 2004. Early Carboniferous Fishes (Acanthodian, Actinopterygians, and Chondrichthyes) from the East Sector of North Qilian Mountain, China - Vertebrata PalAsiatica 42(2):89-110. Stethacanthus teeth have been recovered from the Frasnian-Famennian Napier Formation and the Tournaisian Laurel Formation and Moogooree Limestone in Western Australia. A partial palate and jawbone referred to a Stethacanthus sp. has also been recovered from the Bonaparte Basin, Western Australia. Classification Symmorium reniforme The presence of globular calcified cartilage in both the spine-brush complex base plate and brush and in the claspers is interesting because it is the first record of such a large mass of globular calcified cartilage in chondrichthyan. The high presence of globular calcified cartilage raises several questions about the evolution of sharks. It is possible that prismatic cartilage, a defining feature of chondrichthyans, is an evolutionary derivative of globular calcified cartilage. If this were the case, primitive chondrichthyans would have appeared with shark-like scales based instead on globular calcified cartilage. Another feature of note is the thin, acellular bone layer coating the brush and baseplate of the spine-brush complex. It is possible that the coating on the spine-brush complex is the first record of endoskeletal bone in primitive chondrichthyans, and that these endoskeletal features were lost in extant chondrichthyans. It is also possible that the fin spine could be a unique distribution of dermal skeleton and thus derived from neural crest. Following this assumption, the brush would be a fin-baseplate extension. The endoskeletal location and absence of fin radials supports the latter hypothesis. Taxonomic relationships are hard to define for Stethacanthus as there is much variability in the characteristics of the discovered specimens. Chondrichthyes is a monophyletic group characterized by the development of endoskeletal tesserae (mineralized blocks of cartilage) and internal fertilization. Chondrichthyes is further divided into two subclasses: Elasmobranchii and Holocephali. Stethacanthids have been classified as a member of the group Paleoselachii, which is a subdivision of Elasmobranchii. Stethacanthus has been further classified as part of the order Symmoriida, a classification that has sparked a controversy. There are two main hypotheses regarding this classification. One hypothesis states that the Order Symmoriida consists of the families Symmoriidae, Stethacanthidae and Falcatidae and thus are a monophyletic group. Another is that symmoriids are actually the females of stethacanthids or are derived from stethacanthids. This hypothesis is due to the fact that stethacanthids and symmoriids are poorly defined; symmoriids are thought to lack a spine-brush complex but are otherwise identical to stethacanthidae. Stethacanthids are identified by the presence of a spine- brush complex, which is in some cases non-existent (e.g. juvenile males), making the certain classification of stethacanthids and symmoriids difficult. More recently, Symmoriida as a whole has been reclassified as part of Holocephali, meaning that Stethacanthus is more closely related to modern chimaeras than to sharks.

History In the 19th century, Michoud was a small rural village in Orleans Parish outside of the city limits on Gentilly Road, named after French sugar farmer Antoine Michoud. The original tract of land, located in eastern New Orleans, was part of a 34,500 acre French Royal land grant to local merchant, Gilbert Antoine de St. Maxent. In 1827, the land was acquired by Antoine Michoud, the son of Napoleon's Administrator of Domains, who moved to the city in 1827. Michoud operated a sugar cane plantation and refinery on the site until his death in 1863. His descendants continued operating the refinery and kept the original St. Maxent estate intact into the 20th century. Two brick smokestack blast furnaces from the original refinery still stand before the Michoud facility today. After the construction of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway some industrial development of the area began, growing with military plants during World War II, most importantly Higgins Industries factories. A small military airfield was built in the 1940s and 1950s. During that time, architect Andrew J. Higgins was contracted by the U.S. Government to construct a new aircraft manufacturing facility adjacent to the airfield, at a cost of $180 million ($2.8 billion in 2018).https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/ By the 1960s, the Michoud airfield runway was demolished, except the manufacturing buildings. NASA acquired the factory for the moon program; it is now known as the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility complex. This area has the distinction of being the fastest- sinking part of Louisiana and one of the fastest-sinking areas of the Gulf Region. It is also among the lowest areas in the city in terms of elevation.

History  Bakersfield was developed during the 1930s, with a mixture of private and council residential housing. A remarkable feature of the council housing (designed by T. Cecil Howitt) is the space given over to gardens and other open spaces. Other amenities added later included a supermarket (Greater Nottingham Coop on Oakdale Road), numerous smaller shops and a sub post-office. In common with most Nottingham developments of the time, housing was provided first, with other facilities being added later.  Government  Bakersfield lies on the eastern edge of Nottingham unitary authority, running up to the boundary with Gedling Borough Council. It is in the Nottingham East constituency for Westminster elections.  Geography  Bakersfield occupies the eastern end of Dales ward, around Oakdale Road. It lies between the suburbs of Sneinton to the west, Carlton to the northeast, and Colwick to the southeast. To the south is Colwick Woods, a large area of ancient woodland and green open space, leading down to the Nottingham Racecourse at Colwick. There are panoramic views from the top of Colwick Woods, of the Trent Valley as far as Belvoir Castle and across the city to Wollaton, Clifton and the Ratcliffe on Soar power station. A feature of the area is that many of the road names end in 'dale' (for example Parkdale, Middledale, Langdale, Greendale and Kirkdale), which sometimes causes confusion for first-time visitors.  Demography  Bakersfield was once inhabited by post war Polish/Italian immigrants. Many of the Italian immigrants were prisoners of war who were held in the Prisoner of War camp situated on Colwick Woods. While Poles and Italians still have a presence here, It now has an increasing South Asian demographic.  Economy  Bakersfield missed out on the great industrialisation of the 19th century and was created as a dormitory for commuters into Nottingham city centre.  Culture and community  The Rio cinema on Oakdale Road opened in 1939 and closed due to the onslaught of television in 1959. It then became a night club; later still it was converted into a shop ('Supasave'). The ground floor is used as a shop, called \\"Nisa Local\\" (formerly \\"Oakdale Stores\\") with the former balcony level as a snooker club that was closed in November 2008, having since re-opened as a restaurant which has since closed. There are a couple of public houses, a medical centre and a community centre.  Landmarks  The former public house, The Oakdale, that used to greet you as you enter Bakersfield, stood on the original site of a large farm barn. Over the years it has been the centre of the local community and in the Second World War was a bomb shelter. The public house has now closed and the premised now house a Tesco Local store. Oakdale Road and the pub both get their name from a large oak tree that stood there till bad weather caused damage, and it was deemed unsafe and had to be felled.  Transport  The railway to Netherfield and Grantham runs along the A612 road on the southern edge of Bakersfield but the area has not had a station since the Racecourse station shut in 1959. = Buses = Nottingham City Transport * 43: Nottingham - Sneinton Dale - Bakersfield Nottingham Minibus * 73A: Netherfield - Bakersfield - Sneinton  Education  Some primary students attended Jesse Boot Primary School, Hereford Road, Parkdale Primary School, Parkdale Road. Comprehensive age students accessed schools around the immediate area, such as Greenwood Dale, Manvers Pierrepont, Carlton Road and further down Sneinton Road. Further Education was initially at the Forest Fields College and as of the late 1990s in the now defunct Manvers Pierrepont Comprehensive, Carlton Road.  Religion  The parish church of St John the Baptist at Carlton (further up Oakdale Road, opened in 1957) and St Stephen's on Sneinton Dale cover the area for the Church of England. The Church of St Cyprian on Marston Road, off Dale View Road, was built in 1913. Dales United Reformed Church was built in 1930.  Sport  Nottingham Racecourse and Nottingham Greyhound Stadium lie on the southern edge of Bakersfield. There was a public pitch and putt course in Colwick Woods which was closed some years ago.  Notable people  Jack Burkitt captained Nottingham Forest to their 1959 FA Cup win against Luton Town. He managed Notts County in 1966 and then worked for Brian Clough at Derby for a few years before leaving football to take over Oakdale Road post office.

Emotion work may be defined as the management of one's own feelings, or work done in an effort to maintain a relationship; there is dispute as to whether emotion work is only work done regulating one‚Äôs own emotion, or extends to performing the emotional work for others. Hochschild Arlie Russell Hochschild, who introduced the term in 1979, distinguished emotion work ‚Äì unpaid emotional work that a person undertakes in private life ‚Äì from emotional labor: emotional work done in a paid work setting. Pdf. Emotion work has use value and occurs in situations in which people choose to regulate their emotions for their own non-compensated benefit (e.g., in their interactions with family and friends). By contrast, emotional labor has exchange value because it is traded and performed for a wage. In a later development, Hochschild distinguished between two broad types of emotion work, and among three techniques of emotion work. Preview. The two broad types involve evocation and suppression of emotion, while the three techniques of emotion work that Hochschild describes are cognitive, bodily and expressive. However, the concept (if not the term) has been traced back as far as Aristotle: as Aristotle saw, the problem is not with emotionality, but with the appropriateness of emotion and its expression. Examples Examples of emotion work include showing affection, apologizing after an argument, bringing up problems that need to be addressed in an intimate relationship or any kind of interpersonal relationship, and making sure the household runs smoothly. Emotion work also involves the orientation of self/others to accord with accepted norms of emotional expression: emotion work is often performed by family members and friends, who put pressure on individuals to conform to emotional norms. Arguably, then, an individual's ultimate obeisance and/or resistance to aspects of emotion regimes are made visible in their emotion work. Cultural norms often imply that emotion work is reserved for females. There is certainly evidence to the effect that the emotional management that women and men do is asymmetric; and that in general, women come into a marriage groomed for the role of emotional manager. Criticism The social theorist Victor Jeleniewski Seidler argues that women's emotion work is merely another demonstration of false consciousness under patriarchy, and that emotion work, as a concept, has been adopted, adapted or criticized to such an extent that it is in danger of becoming a \\"catch-all-clich√©\\". More broadly, the concept of emotion work has itself been criticized as a wide over- simplification of mental processes such as repression and denial which continually occur in everyday life. Literary analogues Rousseau in The New Heloise suggests that the attempt to master instrumentally one's affective life always results in a weakening and eventually the fragmentation of one's identity, even if the emotion work is performed at the demand of ethical principles.

Stewart worked with a number of the great directors of his time, including George Cukor (a frequent collaborator), Michael Curtiz and Ernst Lubitsch. Stewart was also a member of the Algonquin Round Table, and, with Ernest Hemingway's friend Bill Smith, the model for Bill Gorton in The Sun Also Rises by Hemingway. His 1922 parody on etiquette, Perfect Behavior, published by George H Doran and Co, was a favourite book of P. G. Wodehouse. Life and career His hometown was Columbus, Ohio. He graduated from Yale University, where he became a brother to the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter), in 1916 and was in the Naval Reserves in World War I. After the war he started to write, and found success with A Parody Outline of History, a satire of The Outline of History (1920) by H. G. Wells. This led him to becoming a member of the Algonquin Round Table. Around that time a friend of his got him interested in theater and he became a noted playwright on Broadway in the 1920s. He was friends with Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, George S. Kaufman, and Ernest Hemingway, who partly based the character of Bill Gorton in The Sun Also Rises on Stewart. There is evidence that Stewart published [Doran Company] in 1922 with no credit as author \\"Timothy Tubby's Journal.\\" In 1924, he wrote Mr. and Mrs. Haddock Abroad for the publishing house George H. Doran. It was a send up of the ugly American tourist. He became interested in adapting some of his plays to film, but on first entering Hollywood he had to adapt the plays of others as his own were initially shelved. Once there he mostly wrote, but he also had a small part in the film Not So Dumb. By the 1930s he had become known primarily as a screenwriter and won an Academy Award for The Philadelphia Story (1940). As World War II approached, he became a member of the Hollywood Anti-Nazi League, and admitted to being a member of the Communist Party USA at one of its public meetings. During the Second Red Scare Stewart was blacklisted in 1950 and the following year he and his wife, activist and writer Ella Winter (they had married in 1939), emigrated to England. In 1968, he signed the ‚ÄúWriters and Editors War Tax Protest‚Äù pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.‚ÄúWriters and Editors War Tax Protest‚Äù January 30, 1968 New York Post His 1975 memoir is entitled By a Stroke of Luck.

The plants are generally tropical herbs or subshrubs with velvety stems and foliage and brightly colored flowers with spots or markings in contrasting colors. They are rhizomatous and commonly include a period of dormancy in their growth cycle. The genus was recently revised by Kvist & Skog (1992) and was recognized as having 19 species distributed in Central America and South America. Recent phylogenetic work by Roalson et al. (2005) indicated that the epiphytic genus Capanea is derived from within Kohleria, and the two species of Capanea were subsequently transferred to Kohleria. The genus Pearcea is closely related. Because of their colorful and exotically patterned flowers, as well as a general interest in the many tropical flowering plants that were being introduced from the Americas, kohlerias were very popular in England and Europe in the 19th century. Many species and hybrids were lavishly illustrated in horticultural magazines such as Curtis's Botanical Magazine under the discarded or erroneous names of Achimenes, Gesneria, Isoloma, Sciadocalyx, and Tydaea. These species and hybrids almost entirely disappeared in the early 20th century, and plant breeders have only recently begun to work extensively with this genus again. Several species are widespread, variable, weedy, and tend to hybridize in the wild, and numerous names have been described that are synonyms of other species or are hybrid taxa.  Selected species and varieties  *Kohleria affinis (syn. Capanea affinis) *Kohleria allenii *Kohleria amabilis **Kohleria amabilis var. amabilis **Kohleria amabilis var. bogotensis (syn. K. bogotensis) *Kohleria hirsuta *Kohleria inaequalis *Kohleria spicata *Kohleria tigridia (syn. Capanea grandiflora) *Kohleria villosa *Kohleria warscewiczii Cultivation Their showy flowers and ease of culture have made them popular with growers of indoor houseplants. Numerous species and hybrids are now in cultivation, some with patterned or variegated foliage as well as vivid flowers. They are easily propagated by both stem cuttings and division of the rhizomes.

Because of his cunning politics he managed to remain independent and avoid getting deposed by the Turko-Mongol ruler Timur. Family and accession to the throne The son of the Shirvanian prince Sultan Muhammad, Ibrahim was born in a village in Shakki, where he took care of the agriculture. After the death of Shirvanshah Hushang in 1382, Ibrahim I was selected to be the ruler by the local nobility. Reign Map of Caucasus and its surroundings. In 1386, Ibrahim recognized the powerful Turko-Mongol ruler Timur as his suzerain. When Timur arrived to Caucasus in 1394, Ibrahim gave him gifts and riches as presents in order to maintain good relations with him. However, one of these gifts were eight slaves, which Timur did not see as enough‚Äîwhen he asked Ibrahim why he had only given eight slaves, Ibrahim replied: \\"I am myself the ninth\\". This made Timur glad, who due to the kindness of Ibrahim gave him much land and promised to protect him. From 1399 to 1402, Ibrahim fought alongside Timur in his campaigns in Syria and Anatolia. Timur later died in 1405, fighting and rebellion broke, causing great disruption. Ibrahim was one those; he used the death of Timur as an opportunity to declare independence and seize Ganja and Karabakh. In 1412, the Kara Koyunlu ruler Qara-Yusuf, who ruled Azerbaijan, invaded the territory of Ibrahim, who requested aid from the Georgian ruler Constantine I of Georgia, who came to his assistance; a battle shortly ensured near Chalagan, which resulted in the defeat of the combined Shirvanian-Georgian forces. Ibrahim, along with his sons and Constanine were then imprisoned. Some time later, due to the bad behavior of Constantine, Qara-Yusuf had him, his son and other Georgians executed. Furthermore, Qara- Yusuf had also caused great destruction in Shirvan. Ibrahim later paid a huge amount of money in return of being freed. Ibrahim went back to his kingdom and struggled to restore order in it. He died in 1418 and was succeeded by his son Khalilullah I. Legacy Mosque in Baku constructed during the reign of Ibrahim I. Ibrahim I revived Shirvan's fortunes, and through his cunning politics managed to avoid Timurid conquest, letting his kingdom continue without paying tribute.

It was originally released on the ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and MSX. A version for the Atari ST was published in 1988. It is the fourth and final game in the Magic Knight series. The in-game music is by David Whittaker. Plot Magic Knight finally returns home, having obtained a second-hand time machine from the Tyme Guardians at the end of Knight Tyme. However, there has been an accident whilst travelling back and there are now two Magic Knights - the other being \\"Off-White Knight\\", the dreaded Stormbringer (so called because of his storm cloud which he plans to use to destroy Magic Knight). Magic Knight cannot kill Off-White Knight without destroying himself in the process. His only option is to find Off-White Knight and merge with him. Gameplay Gameplay takes the form of a graphic adventure, with commands being inputted via the \\"Windimation\\" menu-driven interface, in the style of the previous two games, Spellbound and Knight Tyme (1986). Magic Knight again has a limited amount of strength which is consumed by performing actions and moving from screen to screen as well as being sapped by various enemies such as the Stormbringer's storm cloud and spinning axes and balls that bounce around some rooms and should be avoided. The need for the player to monitor Magic Knight's strength and avoid enemies means that Stormbringers gameplay is closer to the arcade adventure feel of Spellbound rather than the much more pure graphic adventure feel of Knight Tyme. As with the previous two Magic Knight games, there are characters with whom Magic Knight can interact and have help him. Magic Knight's spellcasting abilities are also important for solving the game's puzzles including the \\"merge\\" spell to be used when he finds Off-White Knight.

Born near Sarnia, Ontario, Kock grew up working for the family business, Huronview Nurseries. A graduate of the University of Guelph in 1977 with an emphasis on horticulture, he stayed connected to the university until his death. Affectionately known as \\"Mr. Arboretum\\", he was diagnosed with brain cancer in July 2004; he finally succumbed to the disease on Christmas Day, 2005, at the age of 53. Legacies After the devastating effects of Dutch elm disease on the provincial elm population, Kock created the Elm Recovery Project, collecting scions from the survivors, developing a breeding program and raising the young trees for eventual restoration of DED-tolerant elms in the wild. Another notable legacy left by Kock is the Guelph Hillside Festival, which he co-founded. Celebrated every year in July at Guelph Lake, just north of the city, folk and other musical acts gather for a three-day weekend event attended by hundreds of people. Other projects Kock was also known for his many activist activities, especially those regarding plants. He helped to organize the first Guelph Organic Conference, which has increased in popularity each year. He rallied for peace in Iraq, renewable energy, public transit and urban bicycling, as well as being a regular attendee of the International Women's Day in Toronto each year with his wife. At the time of his death he was working on a book on growing native trees from seed, a project which some of his botany colleagues at the University of Guelph Arboretum completed. Additionally, Kock often travelled the province with talks and slide shows about protecting wild placing, propagating native plant species, and alternatives to garden pesticides. Most notably, however, Kock is recognized for establishing gene banks for rare native plants, including elms. Accolades * 1998 - Governor General's Award for Forest Stewardship * 1999 - Forest Stewardship in Canada Award * 2004 - Named one of two of Canada's best naturalists by Gardening Life magazine Family Kock met Anne Hansen in 1991, whom he later married. He is survived by his wife Anne; his parents Mary and Dick of Bright's Grove; his brother John Cook and his wife Cynthia in Forest; his sister Helen Rykens and her husband Dan McDermott in Toronto; and a niece and two nephews. He was predeceased by his sister Irene.

An uncommon combination of the superhero and romance genres, it introduced two LGBT male characters into the DC Universe ‚Äì Frostbite and Off-Ramp ‚Äì who were depicted becoming a couple, which was considered groundbreaking for the time. Unusually for a comic set in an established publisher-owned universe, Dan Raspler and Dev Madan retained copyright to the stories and art. Publication history The series was created by Dan Raspler and Dev Madan, and explored the trope of the \\"garage band\\" as it applied to superheroes: the Young Heroes (as they called themselves) were not so much a team as a somewhat haphazard grouping of superhumans who had been persuaded to work together, but were not really ready to deal with it. The series was involved with two crossovers. Genesis featured some of the cast going through power-changes and the defeat of Kalibak. The #1,000,000 issue was a part of the DC One Million storyline. It featured mainly citizens of the future who resembled the characters but, near the end, had appearances by older versions of Off-Ramp and Frostbite. Characters * Hard Drive, also known as Jeremy Horton is the team's self- proclaimed leader. A powerful telekinetic and also has telepathic powers of persuasion which he keeps a secret. Hard Drive has preconceived notions as to how the team members should behave and interact, and was not above manipulating their minds and behaviors to fit these notions. He eventually has a nervous breakdown, after which he retires from being a hero and becomes governor of Connecticut. * Off-Ramp, also known as George Sloan has the ability to open portals to anywhere in time and space and ride a vehicle through it. Off-Ramp's preferred vehicle is his hot-rod, a car he has named \\"Roadshow\\". He is eventually revealed to be one of a small clan of \\"travelers\\" who share his abilities. He is a loving father, his young son lives in Italy. * Monstergirl, also known as Rita Lopez. She has the ability to shape shift into animals, monsters, and even human forms. Monstergirl joined the group along with her childhood friend Thunderhead. She eventually discovers that she is an alien being. She goes to work for Hard Drive when he becomes governor of Connecticut. * Bonfire, also known as Anne Fletcher is a pyrokinetic. Hard Drive and Monstergirl tried to manipulate Bonfire into a romance with Thunderhead; however, she was more interested in Frostbite. * Thunderhead also known as Scott Tucker is superhumanly strong and resistant to damage. In the wake of the Genesis event, he gains electrical powers. * Frostbite had cold- related powers, blue skin and hair, and pointed ears. He was later revealed to be bisexual, and to have a lifespan of more than 80,000 years (he appeared, visibly older but still functional, in the 1,000,000 issue). * Junior, also known as Benjamin Newton is the most intelligent of the team, and stands at six inches tall. The laboratory accident responsible for his condition did not give him the ability to return to normal size. * Zip-Kid, also known as Stacy Taglia, is able to shrink from human size to six inches tall, and (unlike Junior) to grow back to normal. She is also able to fly, and to fire concussive blasts from her hands.

Fobaproa was applied in 1995 during the economic crisis to protect all Mexican banks from going bankrupt, and thus destroying the Mexican economy. However, a number of corruption cases involved in the action have been discovered and since then, it has become an object of criticism by members of the opposition. It was replaced, in 1998, by Instituto para la Protecci√≥n al Ahorro Bancario (Bank Savings Protection Institute), current Mexico's deposit insurance agency. Background In 1982, at the end of the presidency of Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo (December 1976-December 1982) the government found itself unable to meet demands for United States dollars and devaluated the peso from a value of 26 to 47 pesos per dollar. A consequence was an extremely high default debt. The L√≥pez Portillo administration then decided to nationalize the banking system on September 1 of the same year, paying 3 trillion pesos (approximately 63 billion dollars at 47 pesos/dollar exchange rate) to acquire public and private credit institutions who had an accumulated debt of 25 billion dollars. The following year, in the middle of an economic crisis, president Miguel de la Madrid (December 1982-December 1988) created the FICORCA (Fideicomiso de Cobertura de Riesgo Cambiario or \\"Exchange risk coverage fund\\") financed by a loan that would also finance the fiscal deficit, the external debt and the economic activity of the country. This fund saved twenty of the largest companies of the country from bankruptcy; these companies owed 12 billion dollars through notes with the Banco de M√©xico. On November 10, 1986 the FONAPRE (Fondo de Apoyo Preventivo a las Instituciones de Banca M√∫ltiple or \\"Fund of preventive support to banking institutions\\") was founded to preserve the financial stability of banks, with the government having banks as trustees. By 1987, a parallel finance industry had been created with brokering firms, investment societies etc. To continue attracting investors, interest rates increased at the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, and with the crash in the New York Stock Exchange, the national banking system was deeply affected and another devaluation came as a result. Fobaproa is created In 1990, in an attempt to prevent situations similar to those of the previous two administrations, the government of Carlos Salinas de Gortari instituted the Fobaproa, a contingency fund for extraordinary financial problems. The Fobaproa would assume outstanding debt and would capitalize banks in the advent of economic crises that would present liquidity problems for these institutions. The following year hundreds of companies the government owned were privatized, in an attempt to reduce government expenses and to liberalize the economy. Eighteen banks were sold at 37.8 billion pesos for a total of 61.6 billion pesos for all 409 companies. 1994 economic crisis In December 1994 during the government of Priista Ernesto Zedillo (December 1994-December 2000), after 6 years of battling with inflation, an overvalued peso, the reduction of international dollar reserves, political scandals in 1994 in Mexico and other factors caused one of the worst economic crisis in the recent history of Mexico. Skyrocketing interest rates caused that many companies were unable to meet payments while others withdrew massive amounts of capital. With the risk of another financial collapse the Fobaproa was applied in 1995. The Fobaproa assumed debt for 552 billion pesos. Not applying the Fobaproa would have likely caused an interruption of credit and withdrawal from saving accounts for millions of families and thousands of companies. In January 1995 the Procapte (Programa de Capitalizaci√≥n Temporal (Procapte) or \\"Temporary capitalization program\\") was created while the Fobaproa was assuming outstanding debt to banks. The Procapte allowed faster access to a higher volume of foreign capital and the solvency of banks. A condition for Fobaproa to assume the debt was that stockholders of these financial institutions would re-invest their capital. In 1996 the Ucabe (Unidad Coordinadora para el Acuerdo Bancario Empresarial (Ucabe) or \\"Coordinating unit for the Bank- Entrepreneur Agreement\\") was created so that debt could be re-structured through it. 54 companies took advantage of the Ucabe to re-structure 9.7 billion dollars and avoid defaults. Preventive measures In March 1998, the Zedillo cabinet presented to the Congress of Mexico four initiatives to create a legal framework to reduce the risk of another banking crisis and to create more efficient mechanisms to supervise the credit activity and to ensure bank capitalization. This package would demand more discipline in the administration of the banking system and propose the Fogade (Fondo de Garant√≠a de Dep√≥sito or \\"Deposit guarantee fund\\") to protect the capital of small and medium savings holders. Another initiative was the creation of the Comisi√≥n para la Recuperaci√≥n de Bienes (\\"Commission for the recovery of assets\\") to recover and administer assets that the Fobaproa and the Fameval (Fondo de Apoyo al Mercado de Valores or \\"Support fund for the Stock Market\\") acquired after the crisis. Controversy The last initiative was to convert to public debt the amount of 552 billion pesos the Fobaproa assumed. This caused Congress to order an audit and to freeze the initiatives until the completion of such audit. In July 1998, the Secretar√≠a de Hacienda y Cr√©dito P√∫blico (SHCP, the Mexican Office of Revenue) approved Congress to analyze all operations associated with the Fobaproa. Congress also held hearings with several officers and ex-officers, entrepreneurs and bankers to discover any fraud that might have taken place during the Fobaproa. Much of the payable debt was also classified as unpayable, and no investigations were made to know if there was any amount that could be recovered. =PRD= The Party of the Democratic Revolution (\\"Partido de la Revoluci√≥n Democr√°tica\\" or PRD) published a document titled Fobaproa: El gran atentado contra la econom√≠a. Alternativas para impedirlo (Fobaproa: The great attack against the economy. Alternatives to prevent it) and opposed the conversion of private debt to public debt. The PRD also demanded punishment to government officers and business people that mismanaged the funds, and to restrict support to small and medium-size investors. On August 4 of the same year the PRD made public a list of those who benefited from the Fobaproa amidst accusations by the SHCP, the Ministry of the Interior of violations to the law of banking secrecy. The president of the PRD, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador declared that it would be \\"unconstitutional\\" to convert the funds owed by investors and bankers in public debt. =PAN initiatives= On August 20 of the same year the National Action Party (\\"Partido Acci√≥n Nacional\\" or PAN) published the document Propuestas de soluci√≥n integral a la crisis bancaria (\\"Proposals for an integral solution to the banking crisis\\") and declared that not only external factors were involved in the economic crisis but also the inefficiency and corruption in the administration of banks. One of the proposals was the creation of a Instituto para el Seguro de Dep√≥sitos Bancarios (\\"Institute of the Insurance of Bank Deposits\\") supervised by Congress and to protect funds of saving-holders. =PRI initiatives= A week later, on August 28 the Institutional Revolutionary Party (\\"Partido Revolucionario Institucional\\" or PRI) proposed the reduction of 30% of the debt assumed by the Fobaproa and that banks assumed the risk they had agreed to when the debt was acquired by the government: 45% for mortgage loans and 60% for fishing and agricultural groups. They also demanded denying bail to white collar employees involved with corruption and a stricter supervision of banks. Executive and Legislative Branch agreements On September 1998, the government of Ernesto Zedillo and the groups of the PAN, PRD, PRI, PT and PVEM in Congress agreed on establishing a framework of agreements to approve the presidential initiatives. The agreements contemplated the creation of supervision mechanisms to oversee credit activities, to study the legality of financial operations associated with the Fobaproa, to establish legal frameworks to prevent new financial crises, to punish those who illegally benefited from or permitted unlawful operations and to support small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and a more equitable distribution of the costs of the Fobaproa.

J√°come, arrived on the Iberian peninsula, with many of his compatriots on business, and lived in the northern city of Porto for at least ten years.Jos√© Guilherme Reis Leite (2012), p.58 The perceived notion that de Bruges was recommended by Joost De Hurtere (a Flemish nobleman in the service of Isabella of Burgundy, sister of Duarte I of Portugal) was dismissed, with the Silves document between de Burges and Henry. It was seigniorial contract between the two men; in the 2 March 1450 contract, de Bruges received the first license from Prince Henry to lead a contingent of settlers to the island of Terceira, the 'third' island of the Azorean archipelago. The document did not stipulate the nationality, and along with seventeen Flemish families, de Bruges settled on Terceira. Yet, even with his efforts, and ten years, J√°come de Bruges was unable to fulfill his contract; this was confirmed by the donation letter of the islands of Terceira and Graciosa, made by Prince Henry to his nephew, the Infante D. Fernando. The Infante Fernando then changed the colonial settlement strategy, sending people of confidence to the islands (ultimately the contract between Bruges and Henry expired and he returned to the continent).Jos√© Guilherme Reis Leite (2012), p.59 But, by the end of the 16th century, de Bruges returned to Terceira; he was one of two captains who were sent to the island: J√°come de Bruges installed his administration in the region of Praia, while √Ålvaro Martins Homem settled in Angra. Each captain commanded two distinct groups of colonists, All of these were Portuguese and none were Flemish. Around 1472 J√°come de Bruges disappeared mysteriously, with the suggestion that he was murdered, thrown overboard while at sea, during a voyage. J√°come de Bruges had been married to the Castilian noblewoman Sancha Rodriguez d'Arce, who bore him two daughters: Antonia and F. Dias d'Arce de Bruges. In addition, he was also known to have sired two illegitimate sons: Gabriel de Bruges (1446-1471) that predeceased his father and was married to the Portuguese noblewoman Isabel Pereira Sarmento; and Pero Gon√ßalves, son of a woman called In√™s Gon√ßalves and whom, otherwise, we know very little about. Therefore, J√°come de Bruges' sole heir was his eldest legitimate daughter, Antonia, since her younger sister had become a nun. This Antonia eventually married Duarte Paim (Edward Payne Montagu), a grandson of Sir Thomas Allen Payne of the Montagu family, the secretary of Philippa of Lancaster. Antonia and her husband are the ancestors of the Paim de Bruges noble family. Ultimately more than two thousand Flemish settled in the Azores during the fifteenth century. Although these Flemish immigrants quickly adapted to Portuguese manners, habits, and culture, their legacy ‚Äî in the form of windmills, clothing, and some lingering physical traits (blond hair and blue eyes) ‚Äî have persisted until the present day on some Azorean islands to remind visitors of a Flemish heritage. Because of the presence of Flemish farmers, the Azores were known, until quite recently, as the Ilhas de Flamengos (Flemish Isles).

In 2006, she competed in the fourth series of the Channel 4 reality series Celebrity Big Brother. Houghton was sent in as a non-celebrity with the task of persuading her celebrity housemates that she was famous. She emerged as the winner of the series, winning a prize of . Following a much-publicised on-screen relationship, Houghton married former fellow Big Brother contestant Samuel Preston of The Ordinary Boys in August 2006. Early life Houghton was born in Wickford, Essex, England, to her parents Allan and Vivien, and has an older brother, Gregg. She attended Bromfords School in Wickford, the same school that Big Brother 8 winner Brian Belo attended. She left school at age 15 with seven GCSEs, then worked in a bank and as an insurance telesales representative.Piers Morgan: The Dark Side of Fame - BBC One, 26 October 2008 Career =Modelling= After various friends suggested she would make a good model, Houghton entered a 2001 competition run by a Motorcycle News magazine, and after winning it became a promotions girl. Wanting to be like her heroine Katie Price, she undertook some glamour modelling, and she started out by having her mother to take some topless shots in a local park. In 2003, she entered a Daily Star competition as a Page 3 girl, which she did not win, but appeared once in the tabloid newspaper. She appeared as a Soccerette model on the Soccer AM show for Sky Sports, and worked for a lookalike agency, portraying Paris Hilton. In 2005, she competed in a Miss Greater London beauty pageant, where she lost to Jenny Velasquez. =Celebrity Big Brother 2006 / Ultimate Big Brother 2010= Houghton had originally applied to be in Big Brother 6 and was a stand-by for that series but was never called up, however producers decided to use her for the upcoming celebrity version as a \\"Fake Celebrity\\". Houghton entered the house on day one and became the first non- celebrity to enter Celebrity Big Brother. She was told by Big Brother that her cover story was that she was a member of a fictional band called Kandy Floss. According to Big Brother, Houghton was the lead singer. Their singles were \\"I Want It Right Now\\", \\"Come Back\\", and \\"More More More\\". \\"I Want It Right Now\\" was their biggest hit. Had she failed to convince them, she would have been evicted from the house. She successfully fooled her housemates and survived to the end of the show. In her Big Brother profile page Houghton described herself as a \\"bright, blonde bimbo\\" (despite not being a natural blonde). She said, \\"I look like Paris Hilton, not on purpose but it's just the way it turned out\\". On 8 January (day four), Big Brother set a task to the group to rate themselves by how famous they thought they were. The celebrity they thought was the most famous stood on the No. 1 podium and the person they considered the least famous stood on the No. 11 podium. Houghton had to avoid being put in the No. 11 podium to prove she had fooled the real celebrities that she was famous and to stay in the house. Houghton survived the task, being chosen to stand on the No. 9 podium, ahead of Samuel Preston and Maggot. She was then called to the diary room to discuss her identity with Big Brother. This was simultaneously shown on a television screen in the lounge, in front of the other housemates. Houghton was nominated for eviction on Day 21, but was saved from eviction by the public as the other two nominees (George Galloway and Dennis Rodman) left the house in a double eviction. While in the house, Houghton established close bonds with Jodie Marsh, and Preston. Houghton won the show on 27 January with 56.4% of the public vote, ahead of Michael Barrymore on 22.7%, earning her GB¬£25,000 (the celebrities were reportedly paid fees of up to GB¬£150,000 each). Houghton re-entered the Big Brother house for Ultimate Big Brother, following the conclusion of Big Brother 2010, and to signal the end of Big Brother on Channel 4. She entered the house with her ex-husband Preston. During the show, Houghton reformed the fake band Kandy Floss with fellow Ultimate Big Brother housemates Victor Ebuwa and Nadia Almada for a task. Houghton survived eviction on Day 11 and subsequently landed third place on the finale with 20.51% of the finale three- way vote on Day 18, finishing behind Nikki Grahame and winner Brian Dowling. =Media career= Houghton also had her own post-Big Brother show called Chantelle: Living the Dream. In May 2006, she signed a ¬£300,000 deal with Random House to publish her autobiography. It was released in October 2006 called Living the Dream which sold 50,000 copies. Extracts from the book were read out by Simon Amstell on the 14 February 2007 edition of Never Mind the Buzzcocks which caused Preston, who was a guest on the show, to walk off the set. Houghton was nominated in the Most Popular TV Contender category at the 2006 National Television Awards, but was beaten by Nikki Grahame, herself a former Big Brother contestant.Results of The National Television Awards 2006 Results and Nominations Houghton has \\"written\\" several columns in magazines, most notably as OK!s BB7 columnist and New!s BB8 columnist. Before becoming New!s BB8 columnist she had another column in the magazine entitled \\"I Want It Right Now\\" in which she shared makeup and fashion tips. In June 2010, Houghton fronted a campaign for Peta called Fight Impotence. Go Vegetarian. In September that year, Houghton was named as the new face of La Senza underwear range. Houghton has appeared as a guest on several TV shows since winning Celebrity Big Brother. These include: * Channel 4's The Friday Night Project on 10 and 17 February 2006 as a co-presenter to Alan Carr and Justin Lee Collins, replacing Debra Stephenson, due to her heavy filming schedule for Coronation Street. * TV3's The Brendan Courtney Show when she jetted in-and- out of Dublin in a matter of hours. * Channel 4's 8 Out of 10 Cats, as a celebrity contestant on 10 March 2006 * ITV1's The Mint, as a special guest * BBC's The Weakest Link, as a celebrity contestant on 5 May 2006, which also featured some reality TV stars Michael Barrymore and Russell Grant; and Big Brother's Big Mouth on 17 August 2006, during the final week of the seventh series of Big Brother. * CBBC's Comic Relief does Beat the Boss, alongside Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne and comedian Joe Pasquale * ITV's GMTV, for an interview in November 2007 * ITV1's Call Me a Cabbie as a trainee in 2007 * BBC One's Hotel Babylon as the girlfriend of Chris Moyles. * BBC Three's Snog Marry Avoid? on 16 February 2009 * Big Brother spin-off show Big Brother's Bit on the Side for Channel 5. * Come Dine With Me for Channel 4, broadcast from 10 to 14 October 2011 Personal life Houghton announced her engagement to Preston on 11 April 2006. In an exclusive ¬£300,000 deal each with OK! magazine, they were married on 25 August 2006 at Dartmouth House in Mayfair, London. After their honeymoon, the couple moved to Preston's flat in Brighton. In a later 2008 interview with Piers Morgan, Houghton admitted that Preston had told her one month after the wedding that he had not wanted to marry her. The couple continued to give interviews to various magazines, with Houghton losing weight and colouring her hair brunette to look more like Preston's former fianc√©e Camille. Ten months later, on 27 June 2007, they announced in a joint statement that they were ending their marriage. \\"After much soul- searching and tearful discussions we have sadly decided to end our marriage,\\" they said in the statement. \\"We hope we can always remain friends and still love each other but we both think we put so much pressure on one another to make our marriage work that it has ended up destroying our relationship. No one else is involved in our decision.\\" The couple divorced in November 2007. Houghton confirmed that she was pregnant by competitive fighter Alex Reid in November 2011, On 17 June 2012, Houghton gave birth to a daughter. The couple separated in October 2012. Chantelle has now married Andrew McMINN and have had 2 children.

Frequently, these red-colored sedimentary strata locally contain thin beds of conglomerate, marl, limestone, or some combination of these sedimentary rocks. The ferric oxides, which are responsible for the red color of red beds, typically occur as a coating on the grains of sediments comprising red beds. Classic examples of red beds are the Permian and Triassic strata of the western United States and the Devonian Old Red Sandstone facies of Europe.U.S. Bureau of Mines Staff (1996) Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, & Related Terms. Report SP-96-1, U.S. Department of Interior, U.S. Bureau of Mines, Washington, D.C.Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P. Mehl, Jr., and J.A. Jackson, J.A., eds. (2005) Glossary of Geology (5th ed.). Alexandria, Virginia, American Geological Institute. 779 pp.  Primary red beds  Krynine (1950) suggested that the red beds were primarily formed by the erosion and redeposition of red soils or older red beds, but a fundamental problem with this hypothesis is the relative scarcity of red-colored source sediments of suitable age close to an area of red-bed sediments in Cheshire, England. Van Houten (1961) developed the idea to include the in situ (early diagenetic) reddening of the sediment by the dehydration of brown or drab colored ferric hydroxides. These ferric hydroxides commonly include goethite (FeO-OH) and so-called \\"amorphous ferric hydroxide\\" or limonite. Much of this material may be the mineral ferrihydrite (Fe2O3 H2O). This dehydration or \\"aging\\" process has been found to be intimately associated with pedogenesis in alluvial floodplains and desert environments. Berner (1969) showed that goethite (ferric hydroxide) is normally unstable relative to hematite and, in the absence of water or at elevated temperature, will readily dehydrate according to the reaction: :2FeOOH (goethite)‚Üí Fe2O3 (hematite) +H2O The Gibbs free energy (G) for the reaction goethite ‚Üí hematite (at 250 ¬∞C) is ‚àí2.76 kJ/mol and Langmuir (1971) showed that G becomes increasingly negative with smaller particle size. Thus detrital ferric hydroxides, including goethite and ferrihydrite, will spontaneously transform into red-colored hematite pigment with time. This process not only accounts for the progressive reddening of alluvium but also the fact that older desert dune sands are more intensely reddened than their younger equivalents.  Diagenetic red beds  The formation of red beds during burial diagenesis was clearly described by Walker (1967) and Walker et al. (1978). The key to this mechanism is the intrastratal alteration of ferromagnesian silicates by oxygenated groundwaters during burial. Walker's studies show that the hydrolysis of hornblende and other iron-bearing detritus follows Goldich dissolution series. This is controlled by the Gibbs free energy of the particular reaction. For example, the most easily altered material would be olivine: e.g. :Fe2SiO4 (fayalite) + O2 ‚Üí Fe2O3 (hematite) + SiO2 (quartz) with E = -27.53 kJ/mol A key feature of this process, and exemplified by the reaction, is the production of a suite of by- products which are precipitated as authigenic phases. These include mixed layer clays (illite ‚Äì montmorillonite), quartz, potassium feldspar and carbonates as well as the pigmentary ferric oxides. Reddening progresses as the diagenetic alteration becomes more advanced, and is thus a time-dependent mechanism. The other implication is that reddening of this type is not specific to a particular depositional environment. However, the favourable conditions for diagenetic red bed formation i.e. positive Eh and neutral- alkaline pH are most commonly found in hot, semi-arid areas, and this is why red beds are traditionally associated with such climates.  Secondary red beds  Secondary red beds are characterized by irregular color zonation, often related to sub-unconformity weathering profiles. The color boundaries may cross-cut lithological contacts and show more intense reddening adjacent to unconformities. Johnson et al. (1997) have also showed how secondary reddening phases might be superimposed on earlier formed primary red beds in the Carboniferous of the southern North Sea. The general conditions leading to post-diagenetic alteration have been described by M√ºcke (1994). Important reactions include pyrite oxidation: :3O2 \\\\+ 4FeS2‚Üí Fe2O3 (hematite) + 8S E = ‚àí789 kJ/mol and siderite oxidation: :O2 \\\\+ 4FeCO3 ‚Üí 2Fe2O3 (hematite) + 4CO2 E = ‚àí346 kJ/mol Secondary red beds formed in this way are an excellent example of telodiagenesis. They are linked to the uplift, erosion and surface weathering of previously deposited sediments and require conditions similar to primary and diagenetic red beds for their formation.

In August 2005, Smith struck a late winner as the Dons defeated rivals Rangers in a league match for the first time since April 1998, wowing the Aberdeen support in only his third competitive game for the club. He was involved in a car crash along with teammate Michael Hart in July 2007, while on a pre-season tour of Egypt. Smith was treated for concussion, while Hart was unhurt. In December 2007, Smith played a key role in Aberdeen's victory over Danish team FC Copenhagen in the 2007‚Äì08 UEFA Cup, scoring two goals in the 4‚Äì0 victory that saw Aberdeen through to the last 32 of the competition. Smith's contract at Aberdeen ended at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season and he expressed concern that he had not been offered a contract extension, stating that he may need to look for a new club in summer. =Colorado Rapids= In May 2009, he was given permission to discuss a contract with Major League Soccer side Toronto FC. However, Toronto passed on the signing of Smith and he later signed with Colorado Rapids in July 2009. In his first season with the Rapids he played only four games before suffering a season-ending knee injury.Rapids Player Profile.

The island, along with neighboring Teuri Island, belongs to the town of Haboro in Rumoi Subprefecture. The island is noted for its dense forests, and fully two-thirds of Yagishiri Island remains forested. History Yagishiri Island, like nearby Teuri, became a base for the fishing of Pacific herring beginning in 1786. In the modern period Yagishiri Island has seen a long-term population decline: in 1947 there were 2,283 residents, by 1972 the number had fallen to 1,073, and in 2010 the population had fallen to 273. Geography Port of Yagishiri, Yagishiri Island Yagishiri is located east of Teuri Island, and the two islands are separated by the Musashi Channel. The island is approximately long from east to west, from north to south, and covers . It has a coastline of roughly . Yagishiri is flatter than nearby Teuri, and reaches an elevation at its center of only . Yagishiri Island is primarily composed of Tertiary-period andesite formed into a four marine terraces, some with significant marine cliffs. Yagishirit≈ç Lighthouse The island has a single lighthouse, Yagishirit≈ç Lighthouse, located above sea level just south of the small Port of Yagishiri. The lighthouse is a concrete structure, painted white, and was constructed in February 1913. The Yagishirit≈ç Lighthouse has an intensity of 7,000 candela. Forest of Yagishiri Taxus cuspidata, the Japanese yew, in the forest of Yagishiri Island Yagishiri Island is noted for its dense forest. The island was once completely covered with trees, but major parts of the forest were used for housing and other construction with the start of the trade of Pacific herring in the late 18th century. A prohibition was put in place on the cutting of trees on the island in 1880 to prevent the complete deforestation of the island. Shortly afterward, in 1886, two thirds of the forest of Yagishiri was lost to a fire. The island has been significantly reforested, with the Uguisu Valley in the center of the island remaining untouched by development or fire. Climatic conditions on the Japan Sea keep the canopy of the forest, specifically in the Uguisu Valley, as low as , and the trunks of various species of trees in the forest are correspondingly thick. The forest is homes to 50 species of trees, but Yagishiri Island is noted for its unspoiled stands of Taxus cuspidata, the Japanese yew. The forest of Yagishiri is a protected natural monument of Japan, and the entirety of the island is protected as a part of Shokanbetsu-Teuri-Yagishiri Quasi-National Park. Transportation Yagishiri Island is connected by two ferries to the port at Haburo. The island is reached by the Ororon 2 in 60 minutes, and the Sanraina in 35 minutes. In winter is served by one trip per day by the Orororan 2, and at the peak tourist season in August the ferries each run three times per day. A single road, the , circles the island.

Life Gasquet was the third of six children of Raymond Gasquet, a physician whose French naval officer father had emigrated to England during the British evacuation of Toulon in 1793. His mother was a Yorkshirewoman. He was born at 26 Euston Place, Somers Town, London. Educated at Downside School, he entered the Benedictines in 1865 at Belmont Priory. He moved to Downside Abbey where he was professed and, on 19 December 1871, ordained a priest. From 1878 to 1885 he was prior of Downside Abbey, resigning because of ill health. Upon his recovery he became a member of the Pontifical Commission to study the validity of the Anglican ordinations (1896) leading to Apostolicae curae, to which his historical contribution was major. In 1900, he became abbot president of the English Benedictines. He was President of the Pontifical Commission for Revision of the Vulgate, 1907. He also authored the major history of the Venerable English College at Rome. He was created Cardinal-deacon in 1914 with the titular church of San Giorgio in Velabro. He was conferred the titular church of Santa Maria in Portico in 1915. In 1917, he was appointed Archivist of the Vatican Secret Archives. In 1924, he was appointed Librarian of the Vatican Library.

The Tuscumbia, Courtland and Decatur Railroad ran from Decatur in Morgan County through the northern half of Lawrence County through Courtland, then into Colbert County and ended in Tuscumbia, Alabama where it connected to the Tuscumbia Railway Company. Construction began in mid-1832, the first segment between Tuscumbia and Leighton was completed in November of that year. Traffic between those two cities began at the day of completion. The second segment between Leighton and Decatur was completed in June 1834. Construction was speedy because of the large cotton industry in North Alabama. Barges could not pass through the rapids caused by the Shoals along the Tennessee River between Florence, and Decatur. The Shoals Canal was congested and the state pursued funding for a railroad between The Shoals and the calmer waters in Decatur. In 1850 it was incorporated into the Memphis and Charleston Railroad which eventually merged into the Southern Railway, a predecessor of Norfolk Southern. The line is still operated by Norfolk Southern Railway and serves as a vital railroad link between The Shoals, and the city of Decatur.

Later used as an administrative seat by the Ernestine dukes of Saxony, the premises were turned into a castle and park erected by the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha from 1827. Monastery Reinhardsbrunn Abbey () was a house of the Benedictine Order founded by the Thuringian landgrave Louis the Springer in 1085, against the background of the fierce Investiture Controversy between Emperor and Pope. It was settled by monks descending from Hirsau Abbey and soon evolved as a centre of the Hirsau Reforms in Thuringia. Like Hirsau, the Reinhardsbrunn monastery was closely related to Cluny Abbey; it stood under Papal protection from 1093. It was also of significance as the proprietary monastery and burial ground of the Ludovingian landgraves like Hermann I who was entombed here in 1217. The monastery became less important after the extinction of the Ludovingians in 1247. Nevertheless, their Wettin successors still used it as a dynastic burial site and an important chronicle was commissioned around 1340, reflecting the history of Thuringia and Germany back to the 6th century. The monastery was looted and sacked during the German Peasants' War in 1525. The monks took refuge within the walls of Gotha and the site was secularized and sold to the Electors of Saxony. While the surrounding estates were administrated by a Saxon Amtmann officials, the former monastery buildings fell into ruin. Castle and park Schloss Reinhardsbrunn in the late 19th century Reinhardsbrunn was part of the Ernestine duchy of Saxe-Weimar from 1572. Duke Friedrich Wilhelm I had parts of the monastery rebuilt as a local administrative seat. The main castle building, restored in about 1706 under Duke Frederick II of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, was rebuilt as a pleasure palace - Reinhardsbrunn Castle - in 1827. Duke Ernest I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, who had inherited the site the year before, built his summer residence here in an English style, surrounded by the first Romantic park in Thuringia. Ernst I was the father of Prince Albert, and hence the father-in-law to Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. It was not, as has been alleged, at Reinhardsbrunn that Victoria met Albert for the first time. They met first in London in May 1836, though after their marriage (1840) and after Albert's death (1861) Queen Victoria did visit Reinhardsbrunn in 1845 and 1862. The Saxe-Coburg and Gotha family kept possession until the end of World War II, when, after some time in the hands of the East German state, the house and estate were used for a short time by Soviet Red Army forces as a military hospital and then for various functions by the government of East Germany, who opened the castle as a showpiece hotel in 1961. Listed in 1891 as one of the artistic landmarks of the duchy, and in 1980 as a landmark of national significance by East Germany, after German reunification the castle was registered in 1992 by the State of Thuringia as a historic monument. Together with its facilities and park, it passed from the Treuhandanstalt into the possession of Western hotel companies, then to a Weimar company, BOB Consult GmbH. BOB Consult was purchased in 2008 by a Russian investment consortium, Rusintech, which did not maintain the castle. The state of Thuringia performed needed repairs, and in July 2018 legally repossessed it to ensure its safety, the first such action in the Federal Republic.

The children of the Snowden family of Clinton, Knox County, Ohio, comprised the ensemble. The band's career stretched from before the American Civil War into living memory; no other African American band of their type lasted as long.Sacks and Sacks 12. The Snowdens earned their living by farming. However, through their music, they integrated themselves into their predominantly white community and entertained, corresponded with, and even taught their white neighbors. A long Knox County tradition credits them with composing (or helping to compose) the song \\"Dixie\\". Performances The Snowden children began touring sometime around 1850. Friends and contacts in other towns often invited them to perform, and their advertising consisted of nothing more than a few handbills and word of mouth. This invitation from Arthur Kirby is typical: > As we are going to have a SuingingSwinging, a type of dance. party the 12th > off August on Saturday The neighborhood requested me to drop you a few Line > to inform you that They want you to come and give us a Concert on that Same > evening. The Suinging part is in The grove is rite by the School House now i > want you to be sure and come if you possibly can and if you can come Send me > three or four bill if you have got them and i will put Them up for you I am > Shure off a Big crowd if you will Come if you can come Send me the Bills by > next Saturday if you can if you have no bills Struck wright any how if you > will come on that Evening and i will put The word out my Self and the rest > of the boys.Kirby, Arthur (July 1876). Letter to Ben Snowden. Knox County. > Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 66. Spelling and punctuation as in original. Ben Snowden Their concert tours lasted for several days and brought them to settlements across rural Ohio. They traveled in a vehicle that one contemporary described as a \\"sort of stage coach carriage\\",Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 64. and they typically stopped in a village or town for a one-night engagement. Sometimes, offers came to play in more lucrative markets farther afield. Friends wrote from Missouri that \\"Ben if you and Lue would come Out here you could make A fortune holding concerts.\\"Scott, Alta, and Scott, Alven (9 June 1883). Letter to Ben and Lew Snowden. Missouri. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 66. Spelling and punctuation as in original. Nevertheless, the band rarely strayed from within a radius of Clinton.Sacks and Sacks 11. The band consisted of five regular members from among the seven Snowden children: Sophia, Ben, Phebe, Martha, Lew (or Lou), Elsie, and Annie. Their instruments were common for the mid-19th century, and most were store-bought. Sophia and Annie played fiddle, possibly the only females at the time known today to have done so.Sacks and Sacks 91. The band's handbills advertised this curiosity; one from the 1860s reads, \\"THEY HAVE TWO FEMALE VIOLINISTS . . . . COME AND SEE THE VIOLIN MASTERED BY FEMALES.\\"Snowden handbill, reprinted in Sacks and Sacks 58. The youngest child, Annie, was billed as \\"the infant violinist\\". Their fiddle-playing style was likely that used by slaves in the South. That is, they stressed rhythm and improvisation at the expense of melody and prewritten music.Sacks and Sacks 62. Their banjos likely played at a lower pitch than that used by white performers.Sacks and Sacks 64. Ben played fiddle and bones, and Lew played banjo; the Snowdens' banjos were fretless, and one was a six-stringer. Phebe danced. In addition, at least one of the Snowden children played guitar and another the flute. The dulcimer, tambourine, and triangle featured in their act on occasion, and the children also sang. A Snowden concert began the instant the family came within earshot of a settlement. The children struck up a tune to gather attention as they headed to the concert site, usually a public location such as a schoolhouse, town hall, field, or graveyard. The price of admission was nominal, typically 25¬¢ for adults and 15¬¢ for children, and payment could be as informal as dropping something into a passed hat. An average engagement earned the band $11 to $12.Sacks and Sacks 66. Audiences were primarily white, and the band performed in a manner that was pleasing to such tastes, yet which sustained their connection to their black culture and heritage.Sacks and Sacks 14. Their shows had no great spectacle aside from some animated dancing. They gathered their repertoire from sheet music, mail order, library songsters, and by playing with other musicians. The Snowdens could not read music, so they learned everything by ear. Most of these songs were popular tunes drawn from minstrel shows and circus acts, though the band avoided material that was overly demeaning of black culture or that was written in over-the-top, racist black dialect. Nevertheless, they avoided overtly abolitionist material. Some of their repertoire was from black composers; they sang both \\"Oh, Dem Golden Slippers\\" and \\"In the Morning by the Bright Light\\" by James A. Bland, for example. They were fairly up to date; the band sang \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" within two years of its composition.Sacks and Sacks 75. Spirituals and hymns comprised another important aspect of their act. Improvisation was common. Lew Snowden Despite their local celebrity, the Snowdens faced the same suspicion as other traveling performers and the racism directed toward blacks in general. White townspeople likely denied them food or lodging at times, and the Snowdens had to be ready to deal with any lawmen who might mistake them for runaway slaves. They relied on their reputation to protect them, and their handbills tried to project this to any who had not heard of them: > The citizens of Mt. Vernon, recommend to you the Snowden Family. We have > known them from their youth up, and they are worthy of all the patronage > that can be afforded them. They are highly respected by the citizens of this > place and wherever they have performed. Their father was a member of the M. > E. Church until his death -- the mother is a faithful member of the same > church. . . . Good references given if required. They also touted their wholesomeness. One handbill asked \\"Christians, Preachers, Lawyers, Doctors\\" to come see them play.Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 103. Still, the dangers of travel were known even to the Snowdens' white acquaintances. E. D. Root wrote to Sophia Snowden: > We are all glad to hear from you and we are glad to hear you are all well > and have got back home safe and well i hope you have done well by travelling > on your account and situation i was wondering what had become of you all a > few days a go and we did not know but you ware all dead.Root, E. D. (no > date). Letter to Sophia Snowden. Pataskala, Ohio. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks > 148. Spelling and punctuation as in original. Where they were well known, they often stayed with some distinguished resident for the night. The next morning, they moved on to the next settlement, usually about ten miles (16 km) away. Their itinerary always remained flexible, and tours had no set duration. One friend wrote: \\"i suppose you have got home buy this time . . . . we have all putt off writing to you so as to bee shure that you may bee at home we thought you may bee gone longer than you expected.\\"Root, George (no date, c. Civil War). Letter to the Snowdens. Harrison, Ohio. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 64. Spelling and punctuation as in original. Songs by the Snowdens Original compositions made up some portion of the Snowden band's repertoire, although they rarely wrote these down. As a result, \\"We Are Goin to Leave Knox County\\", written in the 1860s, is the only surviving song of undeniable Snowden origin. Its first verse and refrain bid the Snowden home farewell: :We are goin to leave knox County :To lands We Nevre Sean :With nothing But our violins :To make the music ring :fare Well knox conty :fare Well fore a Whyle :fare well knox conty Dear :an friends that on ous SmileQuoted in Sacks and Sacks 57. Spelling and punctuation as in original. Still, a Mount Vernon, Ohio, tradition credits the Snowdens with at least one other well-known work: \\"Dixie\\". The story, now in its third generation, dates to the 1910s or 1920s. It even prompted the local black American Legion post to place a new grave marker on Ben and Lew Snowden's final resting site in 1976, reading, \\"They taught 'Dixie' to Dan Emmett.\\"Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 3. Photograph of Dan Emmett taken from the belongings of Ben and Lew Snowden. Howard L. Sacks and Judith Rose Sacks propose that the writers of \\"Dixie\\" were not Ben and Lew Snowden but their parents, Thomas and Ellen Snowden. The idea also appears in a 1978 genealogy of the Greer family of Ohio, which states that \\"After the Greers had settled in Knox Co., Ellen [Cooper] stayed with them until she married Tom Snowden, an entertainer whose musical gifts inspired Daniel Emmett to write 'Dixie.'\\"McMillan, Jean Irwin (1978). The Greer Family Genealogy: Descendants of Robert and Ann Emerson Greer. Columbus: J. I. McMillan, p. 1. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks. The Snowdens made little distinction between music they wrote and music they played, so the idea that they might have collaborated or even given a song to Dan Emmett is therefore not surprising.Sacks and Sacks 161. Evidence does place Emmett where he might have encountered, or even played with, the Snowdens: His grandparents' farm neighbored the Snowdens', his father may have shoed the Snowdens' horses, and his birthplace later became the Snowdens' church. An unpublished biography, written in 1935 by a friend of Emmett's family, places him in Mt. Vernon several times beginning in 1835 and into the 1860s.Sacks and Sacks 168. Furthermore, Ben and Lew Snowden had at least some connection to Emmett. On his death in 1923, one of Lew Snowden's boxes contained a newspaper clipping that named Emmett as composer of \\"Dixie\\" and a framed picture of Emmett with \\"Author of 'Dixie!'\\" written across it.Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 183. Nevertheless, this evidence is, in the end, merely circumstantial. Many scholars, such as E. Lawrence Abel, reject the whole notion of a Snowden connection to \\"Dixie\\".Abel 49. Family life Thomas Snowden, a freed slave, and Ellen Cooper, a house servant, met and married in Knox County. They had nine children, of whom seven survived infancy. Although Thomas and Ellen Snowden were both illiterate, the children attended white schools and learned to read and write. The Snowdens were primarily farmers by trade, with their homestead located at Clinton, Ohio, a small village north of Mount Vernon. In July 1856, the 39-year-old Ellen Snowden became the head of household upon the death of Thomas Snowden, 53. The family soon had trouble paying the mortgage on their farm, prompting them by 1859 to add a line to their handbills proclaiming that they were trying \\"to secure means to pay back indebtedness upon their homestead.\\"Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 80. In 1864, the bank foreclosed on two of their farm's . Ellen Snowden paid the rest of the mortgage the following year. Their music allowed the Snowdens to integrate into their mostly white community.Sacks and Sacks 88-9. Music and the Snowdens were synonymous in the area; the 1860 census for Morris Township in Knox County lists their \\"Profession, Occupation, or Trade\\" as \\"Snowden Band\\",1860 census for Knox County, Morris Township, 16. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 59. and an 1876 city directory for Mount Vernon lists them as \\"Snowden Minstrels\\".White, John W., compiler (1876). White's Mount Vernon Directory, and City Guide, vol. 1, 1876-77, 121. Gambier, Ohio: Argus Book and Job Office. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 59. The Snowdens played local events, or received invitations telling them, for example, that \\"Snowden & Mrs. Snowden Are Respectfully Invited to attend a Birthday Party At Mr. Samuel Alberts of their daughter on Monday Evening. Please bring your music.\\"Albert, Mr. and Mrs. Samuel (20 January 1879). Letter to Ben, Lew, and Ellen Snowden. Mount Vernon, Ohio. Quoted in Sacks and Sacks 88. George Root, a white man, even asked to live with the family during the Civil War so that he could take singing and fiddling lessons. Lew and Ben Snowden on banjo and fiddle in the second-story gable of their home, Clinton, Knox County, Ohio, c. 1890s. When not performing for profit, the Snowdens played for fun and practice in their Clinton home. In later years, Ben and Lew Snowden, on fiddle and banjo respectively, played in the second-story gable of their house for whomever would listen. Their home faced Samuel Smith's tavern, and Smith's patrons often took drinks over to the Snowden yard to enjoy the music. Despite their reputation, the Snowdens were not immune to prejudice. In 1864, Ellen Snowden sued white neighbors who were preventing her from planting crops; she won the case. Days after the passing of the 15th Amendment on 3 February 1870, a local official prevented Ben Snowden from voting. Snowden sued the man but ultimately lost the case. Beginning in 1878, Ben Snowden, aged 38, courted a 23-year-old white woman named Nan Simpson, who lived in Newville, Ohio, just north of Knox County. Their affair lasted two years before Ellen Snowden learned of it and put a stop to the relationship.Sacks and Sacks 148-9. Socially the Snowdens professed conservative values, praising in their letters and music such concepts as women's virtue, temperance, and piety. They attended the African Methodist Episcopal Church, one of the few in the United States at the time that used instruments during the worship service.Sacks and Sacks 73. Less conservatively, they supported abolitionism, though never overtly. By 1900, Ben and Lew Snowden were the last remaining members of the family. They took up racehorse driving as a hobby and continued to farm, but it was still their music that defined them. They performed from their home's gable, and the next generation of fiddlers most likely sought them out. Though there is no hard evidence to prove such meetings occurred, both John Balzell and Dan Emmett likely knew the Snowdens and played with them on occasion.Sacks and Sacks 193-4. Ben Snowden died in 1920, and Lew Snowden in 1923. They left no known heirs. Notes References * Abel, E. Lawrence (2000). Singing the New Nation: How Music Shaped the Confederacy, 1861-1865.

The initial phase of operation was 30 km long, connecting Nagole and Miyapur, over two corridors through Ameerpet Interchange Station. The placement of Metro Stations across the city have been geared to feed the existing transport systems. It was however, criticised for inability to achieve its objectives, low frequency and high fares. The frequency of the services increased further since launch to address the shortage of frequency.

ITC is operating together as a professional graduate school of theology. It is the largest free-standing African American theological school in the United States. Its constituent seminaries are the Morehouse School of Religion (associated with a number of Baptist groups, including American Baptist Churches USA, National Baptist Convention, USA, and Progressive National Baptist Convention); Gammon Theological Seminary (United Methodist Church); Turner Theological Seminary (African Methodist Episcopal Church); Phillips School of Theology (Christian Methodist Episcopal Church); and Charles H. Mason Theological Seminary (Church of God in Christ). All have the mission to educate Christian leaders for ministry and service. Students who are not affiliated with one of the five denominations represented by these seminaries are enrolled in the ITC's Harry V. and Selma T. Richardson Ecumenical Fellowship program. History The idea of a single collaborative institution for the training and development of African American Christian ministers began to form in the early 1940s, after Benjamin Mays became president of Morehouse College and when Gammon Theological Seminary and Morehouse College began a cooperative exchange program. Morehouse College was interested in phasing out its Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.) degree program, while increasing its liberal arts focus. Mays expected that the individual theological schools for African Americans would be unable to obtain the resources to develop and maintain first-rate facilities and programs, but could be successful by working together. Discussions about cooperation between Gammon, Morehouse, and Morris Brown College (representing Turner Theological Seminary) began in the early 1940s. In the 1950s, the concept of a new collaborative seminary in Atlanta gained support from foundations and the American Association of Theological Schools (AATS). The Phillips School of Theology, then located at Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee, later joined the discussions. In 1958 the ITC was founded as a joint initiative of four seminaries: the Baptist-affiliated Morehouse School of Religion, the United Methodist-affiliated Gammon Theological Seminary, Turner Theological Seminary (African Methodist Episcopal), and Phillips School of Theology (Christian Methodist Episcopal). The Sealantic Fund, which had been established by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to support theological education, was a major source of financial support.Carlton A. G. Eversley, \\"Interdenominational Theological Center\\", in In September 1959, when instruction began, there were 21 faculty members and 97 students in the ITC. The new institution occupied the Gammon campus until its own facilities were completed in 1961. The combined institution quickly won accreditation from the AATS, which had previously accredited Gammon. Dr. Harry Van Buren Richardson, the president of Gammon Theological Seminary, became the first president of ITC, serving in that position from 1959 to 1968. The Presbyterian-affiliated Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary joined ITC in 1969, relocating to Atlanta from Charlotte, North Carolina. In 1970 the Charles H. Mason Theological Seminary was established as a new seminary within ITC, named for Church of God in Christ founder Charles Harrison Mason. From 1971 through 1979 the ITC also operated the Absalom Jones Theological Institute in cooperation with the Episcopal Church. This institute was named for Absalom Jones, the first African American to be ordained as an Episcopal priest. Enrollment was insufficient to support operation of this seminary, leading it to close in 1979. The Lutheran Theological Center in Atlanta was established on the ITC campus in 1997. Its establishment was an outgrowth of an enrichment program, started in 1988, through which students from two Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) seminaries took courses at the ITC. The Lutheran Center now provides opportunities for students at any of ELCA's eight seminaries to spend time in Atlanta taking courses at the ITC, Candler School of Theology, or Columbia Theological Seminary for academic credit at their home seminaries. The Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary withdrew from the ITC in June 2014. Academics ITC awards two master's degrees: Master of Divinity (M.Div.), and Master of Arts in Christian Education (M.A.C.E.). ITC also offers one Doctor of Ministry (D. Min.). The Master of Divinity program is available online, as well as on the ITC campus. The D.Min. degree program is intended for persons who are currently engaged in Christian ministry and have at least three years of experience in ministerial leadership. In addition to the degree programs, a Certificate in Theology program has been conducted at a number of off-campus locations in the U.S. and worldwide. This is a community outreach program that provides no academic credit. =Accreditation and affiliations= ITC is accredited to award masters and doctoral degrees by both the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges and the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. In December 2015, the Southern Association's Commission on Colleges reaffirmed ITC's accreditation. On June 7, 2016, the Association of Theological Schools‚Äô (ATS) Commission on Accrediting confirmed that ITC has demonstrated its financial viability. ITC is the only graduate institution of theological education that is a member of the United Negro College Fund. ITC is one of the five organizations that form the Atlanta Theological Association, which also includes the Candler School of Theology, Columbia Theological Seminary, Erskine Theological Seminary, and the Georgia Association for Pastoral Care. Other ITC affiliations includes the Robert W. Woodruff Library and the Atlanta Regional Council for Higher Education. Campus ITC occupies a campus, between Beckwith Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Dr., in the Atlanta University Center, near Morehouse College, Spelman College, Morris Brown College, Clark Atlanta University, and the Morehouse School of Medicine. Faculty and students ITC is the largest free-standing African American theological school in the United States. As of 2017, the institution has about 25 full- and part-time faculty and enrolls about 300 students. More than 15 denominations are represented in the student body. Publications Since 1973, ITC has published an annual academic journal, The Journal of the Interdenominational Theological Center. ITC describes the journal as \\"dedicated to the advancement of theological education with a special emphasis on the African-American perspective.\\" The ITC Press also has published books, including seven volumes in the Black Church Scholars Series. External perspectives In their 1990 book The Black Church in the African American Experience, C. Eric Lincoln and Lawrence H. Mamiya identified the ITC as one of several black ecumenical initiatives that arose in the United States in connection with the civil rights and black consciousness movements. They called the ITC \\"one of the more successful ventures in black ecumenism\\". In their 2007 book The Future of Pentecostalism in the United States, Eric Patterson and Edmund John Rybarczyk described the ITC as \\"a major center of progressive, African American theological thought\\".

The Sheraton style was inspired by the Louis XVI style and features round tapered legs, fluting and most notably contrasting veneer inlays. Sheraton style furniture takes lightweight rectilinear forms, using satinwood, mahogany and tulipwood, sycamore and rosewood for inlaid decorations, though painted finishes and brass fittings are also to be found. Swags, husks, flutings, festoons, and rams' heads are amongst the common motifs applied to pieces of this style. Without pedantic archaeology, it brought the Neoclassical taste of architects like Robert Adam within reach of the middle class. In many respects Sheraton style corresponds with the contemporary Directoire style of France. The Sheraton style was the most reproduced style in the United States during the Federal period.

The first monks were from Brauweiler Abbey, but in the 1080s an abbot from Hirsau Abbey was appointed, and this brought Comburg into the movement of the Hirsau Reforms.

The library survives in the W√ºrttemberg State Library, but the church treasure was melted down in the Ludwigsburg mint. The buildings have had a number of uses since then. Until 1909 a regiment of invalid soldiers (the ') was based here. During World War II the site was used for a variety of training purposes and also at one point as a prisoner of war camp.

It was first outlined by Florian Znaniecki in 1934. He contrasted it with the kind of enumerative induction characteristic of statistical analysis. Where the latter was satisfied with probabilistic correlations, Znaniecki insisted that science is concerned with discovering causal universals, and that in social science analytic induction is the means of discovering these. Chapters 7 and 8. Analytic induction begins by studying a small number of cases of the phenomenon to be explained, searching for similarities that could point to common factors. Once a hypothetical explanation has been developed further cases are examined. If any one of these does not fit the hypothesis, either the hypothesis is reformulated so as to match the features of all the cases so far studied, or the original definition of the type of phenomenon to be explained is redefined, on the grounds that it does not represent a causally homogeneous category. Further cases are then studied until no more anomalies seem to be emerging. The approach was further refined and applied by Alfred Lindesmith in a study of opiate addiction and Donald Cressey in an investigation of financial trust violation (embezzlement). Later it was applied by Howard S. Becker in a study of marihuana use.Becker, H. S. (1953) \\"Becoming a marihuana user\\", American Journal of Sociology, 59, 3, pp. 235‚Äì42.Becker, H. S. (1955) \\"Marihuana use and social control\\", Social Problems, 3, 1, pp. 35‚Äì44. Hammersley, M. (2011) \\"On Becker's Studies of Marijuana Use as an Example of Analytic Induction\\", Philosophy of the Social Sciences, vol. 41 no. 4, pp. 535‚Äì566. This method has been subjected to considerable criticism, notably by W.S. Robinson who argued that it could only discover necessary not sufficient conditions for the production of the phenomenon being investigated.Robinson, W. S. (1951). The logical structure of analytic induction. American Sociological Review, Vol 16, no 6, pp. 812‚Äì818. The term has also come to be used in a variety of ways, some of them bearing little relationship to its original sense. There are some similarities with, but also important differences from, other approaches, notably grounded theory and qualitative comparative analysis. Perhaps analytic induction's most distinctive and important feature is recognition of the potential need to refine and develop the initial categorisation of what is to be explained in the course of producing explanations.

As dean of the school of engineering at Washington University in St. Louis, he developed a manual training programme (a system of general, non-vocational tools training). He opened the St. Louis Manual Training School. Biography Woodward was born at Fitchburg, Massachusetts to Isaac Burnap Woodward and Eliza W. (Wetherbee) Woodward. He graduated from Harvard College with an A.B. in 1860. His first job was to serve as principal of Brown High School in Newburyport, Massachusetts. During the Civil War he enlisted and was promoted to captain of the 48th Massachusetts Infantry. He was stationed during his year of duty (1862‚Äì1863) in Louisiana. He took part in the siege and capture of Port Hudson under General Nathaniel P. Banks. Following his year of service he returned to being principal of Brown High School. He married Fanny Stone Balch on September 30, 1863. They had nine children, five of whom died before reaching the age of ten. At the close of the Civil War, Woodward accepted a position as vice principal of Smith Academy in St. Louis, Missouri (part of Washington University). In 1868, he was appointed assistant professor of mathematics in Washington University. In 1870, he became a professor of mathematics and applied mechanics. That year he also became dean of the polytechnic school. As dean, Woodward began experimenting with manual skills education. Following an influential demonstration of the Della Vos, or Russian, method of tools instruction at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, Woodward began making plans and gathering support for a similar initiative in the U.S. This culminated in the opening, in 1879, of the St. Louis Manual Training School as a subordinate department of Washington University. Without resigning his other duties, he filled the directorship of the school. The school was a pioneer of its kind in the United States, and served as the model in organizing other similar schools, in consequence of which Woodward's expositions of the aims and value of manual training have had much influence in shaping the new education both inside and outside the United States. During the 1880s, the Manual Training School was the largest and most well-attended public high school in St. Louis. The manual training system that Woodward introduced was akin to tools training. Students learned how to use tools by shaping wood or metal, but the products they produced had no commercial value. The worth of the instruction lay mostly in mind-hand coordination. Woodward lectured extensively on manual training and his high school. Yet by the late 1890s, manual training was under greater criticism because of its apparent disconnection to workplace skills. Critics (such as the National Association of Manufacturers) began advocating a system of vocational education that trained students for specific jobs instead of giving students general tools training. He was a member of the school board of St. Louis 1878-80, and president of the St. Louis Engineer Club in 1883/4. Woodward was president of the industrial department of the National Educational Association 1882-84, and vice president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1888, presiding over the section on mechanical science. In 1885 he was invited to present a paper on ‚ÄúManual Training‚Äù before the educational conference in Manchester, England, and afterward he visited the educational institutions of Europe. In 1882, Woodward was granted an honorary doctoral degree in Laws from Washington University. Works * History of St. Louis Bridge (1881) * The Manual Training School (1887) * Manual Training in Education (1890) * Rational and Applied Mechanics (1912) He wrote a large number of papers on mathematical subjects and manual training, which he contributed to scientific journals and other periodicals.

The Volunteers (also known as the Irish Volunteers) were local militias raised by local initiative in Ireland in 1778. Their original purpose was to guard against invasion and to preserve law and order at a time when British soldiers were withdrawn from Ireland to fight abroad during the American Revolutionary War and the government failed to organise its own militia. Taking advantage of Britain's preoccupation with its rebelling American colonies, the Volunteers were able to pressure Westminster into conceding legislative independence to the Dublin parliament. Members of the Belfast 1st Volunteer Company laid the foundations for the establishment of the United Irishmen organisation. The majority of Volunteer members however were inclined towards the yeomanry, which fought and helped defeat the United Irishmen in the Irish rebellion of 1798.Ulster Museum, History of Belfast exhibition Founding As far back as 1715 and 1745, self-constituted bodies of defensive local forces were formed in anticipation of Stuart invasions.Padraig O Snodaigh; THE IRISH VOLUNTEERS 1715‚Äì1793 ‚Äì A list of the units, pg 88. Irish Academic Press, Dublin. For example, in 1744 with the declaration of war with France and in 1745 the landing of Prince Charles Edward in Scotland, a corps of 100 men was enrolled in Cork, known as \\"The True Blues\\", which formed one of the regiments of the \\"United Independent Volunteers\\". In 1757 and 1760 there were volunteer units formed due to the Seven Years' War and due to the French landing at Carrickfergus in 1760. The roll-call of the militia that marched on the French at Swinford listed in the \\"Collectanea politica\\", published in 1803, was titled \\"Ulster volunteers in 1760\\".Bigger, Francis Joseph; Ulster Volunteers in 1760, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Second Series, Vol. 8, No. 4 (Oct. 1902). From 1766 onwards units were embodied by local landlords in various parts of the country for the preservation of peace and the protection of property. Early volunteer groups (which later became part of the Volunteers) included: First Volunteers of Ireland (1 July 1766); Kilkenny Rangers (2 June 1770); First Magherafelt Volunteers (June 1773); and the Offerlane Blues (10 October 1773). The rise of the Volunteers was a spontaneous event fired by patriotism and the threat of invasion, as another French landing was anticipated when war broke out in 1778. With British troops being dispatched from Ireland for the war with the American colonies, the landed gentry reacted nervously, and misunderstandings arose about Ireland's defence capabilities. Claims that Ireland was ill-prepared for an attack, along with alleged negligence from Dublin Castle, was used to justify the existence of Volunteer companies and their role in defending Ireland. In fact around 4,000 soldiers had been dispatched to the American colonies, leaving as many as 9,000 behind in Ireland. The Volunteers were built upon existing foundations. Dublin Castle had created militias throughout the 18th century, however these had fallen into disuse. The Volunteers filled the gap left behind, with possibly half of its officers having held commissions in the militia. Historian Thomas Bartlett claims that the purpose of the militia as defined in 1715 would have fitted with the aims of the Volunteers: \\"of suppressing ... all such insurrections and rebellions, and repelling of invasions\\". Along with this, Irish Protestants of all ranks had a long, strong tradition of self-defence, having formed groups to resist and pursue agrarian insurgents and keeping a watchful eye on Catholics when threats arose. The Volunteers were independent of the Irish Parliament and Dublin Castle, and this was an established fact by 1779. It is claimed that had the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, John Hobart, 2nd Earl of Buckinghamshire, been more pro-active and assertive, then the Volunteers could have come under some form of government control. The regular military deemed the Volunteers of low value in regards to helping repulse a foreign threat. Instead they held the view that they could be a \\"serviceable riot police\\", and it was this that they distinguished themselves for. For example, Volunteer companies did duty whilst regular troops had been called away, whilst others were used to pursue agrarian insurgents. When musicians were organised in Dublin following the introduction of a bill in the Irish Parliament seeking to outlaw textile workers' combinations, the Volunteers were mobilised to maintain the peace in case of public disorder. The British victory over the Spanish off Cape St. Vincent in 1780 saw the fear of invasion dissipate, causing the Volunteers to also become involved in politics. Initially they started off agitating for reforms and measures to promote Ireland's prosperity, but later they moved from peaceful persuasion to \\"the threat of armed dictatorship\\". Politics The Volunteers however were also marked by liberal political views. For instance although only Anglican Protestants were allowed to bear arms under the Penal Laws, the Volunteers admitted Presbyterians and a limited number of Catholics, reflecting the recent Catholic Relief Act of 1778. The Lisburn and Lambeg Volunteers firing a feu de joie in honour of the Dungannon Convention, 1782. The Volunteers additionally provided a patriotic outlet, with each corps becoming a debating society. This brought about a shift in power with the Volunteers being controlled by progressive politically minded people and not by the Establishment. The Volunteers also saw the annual Protestant commemorations such as the Battle of the Boyne and the Battle of Aughrim become displays of patriotic sentiment. In Dublin on 4 November 1779, the Volunteers took advantage of the annual commemoration of King William III's birthday, marching to his statue in College Green and demonstrating for the cause of free trade between Ireland and Great Britain. Previously, under the Navigation Acts, Irish goods had been subject to tariffs upon entering Britain, whereas British goods could pass freely into Ireland. The Volunteers paraded fully armed with the slogan, \\"Free Trade or this\\", referring to their cannon. also cited \\"Free trade or a Speedy Revolution\\".Jonah Barrington's Memoirs; chapter 7 on the Volunteers According to historian Liz Curtis, the British administration in Ireland was vulnerable, and the Volunteers used this to press for concessions from Britain using their new-found strength. This demand of the Volunteers was quickly granted by the British government. The Dublin Volunteers' review, saluting a statue of King William III, in College Green on 4 November 1779 was painted by Francis Wheatley. On 4 June 1782, the Belfast Troop of Light Dragoons volunteer company and the Belfast Volunteer Company paraded through Belfast in honour of the King's birthday. After firing three volleys, they marched to Cave Hill where they were joined by the Belfast Artillery Company, who upon their arrival fired a \\"royal salute of twenty-one guns\\".Paterson, T. G. F.; The County Armagh Volunteers of 1778‚Äì1793: List of Companies, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Third Series, Vol. 6 (1943) Nine years later on 14 July 1792 in contrast to this in a sign of changing opinions, on the second anniversary of the fall of the Bastille, the Belfast Volunteers exuberantly paraded through Belfast and agreed to send a declaration to the national assembly of France, to which they received \\"rapturous replies\\". Dungannon Conventions A print of a painting depicting the Volunteer Dungannon Convention at Dungannon Church, on 15 February 1782 On 28 December 1781, members of the Southern Battalion of the County Armagh Volunteers (who formed the First Ulster Regiment) convened and resolved for a meeting in the \\"most central town of Ulster, which we conceive to be Dungannon\\", in which delegates from every volunteer association in the province of Ulster were requested to attend.Paterson, T. G. F.; A Relic of 1782, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Third Series, Vol. 3 (1940) The date of this meeting was pencilled in for \\"the 15th day of February next, at ten o'clock in the forenoon.\\" On the arranged date, 15 February 1782, delegates from 147 Volunteer corps arrived at the Presbyterian church, at Scotch Street, Dungannon for what would become known as the \\"Dungannon Convention of 1782\\".W. T. Latimer; Church of the Volunteers, Dungannon, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Second Series, Vol. 1, No. 1 (Sep. 1894). This church has formerly been the favourite meeting place of the Presbyterian Synod of Ulster and later the supreme ecclesiastical court of Irish Presbyterians. After the Volunteer convention it was afterwards known as the \\"Church of the Volunteers\\", although some later writers claim the actual meeting place was the Church of Ireland parish church at Drumglass.http://www.irishnews.com/opinion/2015/02/16/news/historic-dungannon- convention-of-1782-115922/ This church was used for the next three conventions of Ulster Volunteer corps: 21 June 1782, with delegates from 306 companies attending; 8 September 1783, with delegates from 270 companies; and almost a decade later on 15 February 1793, when the \\"fires of patriotism that marked the birth of the movement were burning low\\", which the meeting \\"failed to kindle them anew\\". =The meetings= The first meeting is the best known. Many of the Volunteers were just as concerned with securing Irish free trade and opposing English governmental interference in Ireland as they were in repelling the French. This resulted in them pledging support for resolutions advocating legislative independence for Ireland, whilst proclaiming their loyalty to the British Crown. The first convention according to Sir Jonah Barrington, saw 200 delegates marching two by two into the church \\"steady, silent, and determined\\", clothed in their uniform and bearing arms. A poem by Thomas Davis states how \\"the church was full to the door\\". The lower part of the church was reserved for delegates with the gallery for their friends who required tickets for admission.British Museum, Pelham MSS., i, p. 308 (printed in Deputy Keeper's Report, N.I. Record Office (1936), p. 16) Some people who attended the first and second conventions however consider them to be equally important. After pressure from the Volunteers and a Parliamentary grouping under Henry Grattan, greater autonomy and powers (legislative independence) were granted to the Irish Parliament, in what some called \\"the constitution of 1782\\". This resulted in the Volunteers at the third convention proceeding to demand parliamentary reform, however as the American War of Independence was ending, the British government no longer feared the threat of the Volunteers. The fourth convention in 1793 was held after a period of steep decline in Volunteer membership (see Demise below). This was partly the result of sharp division of opinion amongst Volunteers on political matters, so much so that the County Armagh companies refused to send any delegates to the fourth convention. =Relics= The bowl that was used as the pledging-cup of the Volunteers at the first convention was rediscovered in the 1930s in County Tyrone. This bowl was tub-shaped, resembling an Irish mether, and had the original owner's (John Bell) crest and initials engraved on the inside, as well as on the wooden base of it. Decorating this pledging-cup was three silver hoops bearing nine toasts, each of which was numbered as follows: 1. The King, 2. The Queen, 3. The Royal Family, 4. The Memory of St. Patrick, 5. The Sons of St. Patrick, 6. The Daughters of St. Patrick, 7. The Irish Volunteers, 8. The Friends of Ireland, 9. A Free Trade. An obelisk commemorating the Dungannon Convention of 1782, was erected that year by Sir Capel Molyneux, on a hill a few miles north-east of Armagh city. On it is the following inscription: \\"This obelisk was erected by the Right Hon. Sir Capel Molyneux, of Castle Dillon, Bart., in the year 1782, to commemorate the glorious revolution which took place in favour of the constitution of the kingdom, under the auspices of the Volunteers of Ireland.\\" Motifs and mottos Belt-plate of the Belfast Volunteers, featuring the British crown above a harp and the initials \\"B V\\" meaning \\"Belfast Volunteers\\" The primary motif of the Volunteers was an Irish harp with the British crown mounted above it, with either the name of the company or a motto curved around it, or both, i.e. \\"Templepatrick Infantry\\" or \\"Liberty & Our Country\\".Day, Robert; The Ulster Volunteers of '82: Their Medals, Badges, &c.;, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Second Series, Vol. 4, No. 2 (Jan. 1898). This harp and crown motif was prevalent on the Volunteer companies flags, belt-plates and gorgets. Some included the Royal cypher \\"G.R.\\" standing for King George III. Shamrocks also commonly featured. Other mottos included amongst variations: For Our King & Country, Pro Rege et Patria (for King and Country), Quis Separabit (none shall separate), and Pro Patria (for Country) Another Volunteer motto is the oft-repeated Pro Aeris et Focis (for our altars and our hearths), a truncated form of Pro Caesare, Pro Aeris et Focis (for our King, out altars, and out hearths), which was also used.Biggar, Francis Joseph; The Ulster Volunteers of '82: Their Medals, Badges, &c.; Gillball Volunteers, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Second Series, Vol. 5, No. 1 (Oct. 1898). Competitions and awards Drawing of the medal awarded to the First Magherafelt Volunteers for skill with broadsword. Competitions were held between Volunteer corps, with medals given out as marks of distinction for the best marksmen, swordsmen, as well as for the most efficient soldiers. The members of Volunteer corps from the province of Ulster, more specifically from the counties of Antrim, Armagh, Down, Londonderry, and Tyrone featured quite prominently and took an honourable place. Examples of marksmen competitions included best shot with ball and best target shot at 100 yards.Maitland, W. H.; History of Magherafelt, page 13. Moyola Books, 1916, republished 1988. Rewards of merit were also given. Organisation An example of a Volunteer flag; the flag of the Dublin Volunteers. Originally each Volunteer company was an independent force typically consisting of 60 to 80 menPaterson, T. G. F.; The County Armagh Volunteers of 1778‚Äì1793, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Third Series, Vol. 4 (1941) In some parts of the country, a company could consist of between 60 and 100, and were raised in each parish where the number of Protestants made it viable. Alongside the parish companies, towns had one or more companies. For officers a company had as its highest rank, a captain, followed by a lieutenant, and ensign. They also had surgeons and chaplains. Local Volunteer companies would later amalgamate into battalions led by colonels and generals, some of which consisted of ten to twelve companies. Volunteer members accepted no pay, however the more wealthy amongst them shared their funds with their poorer comrades, with officers donating towards the companies stock purse. An example of the amalgamation of Volunteer companies is that of First Ulster Regiment, County Armagh. The First Armagh Company was raised in Armagh city on 1 December 1778, and on 13 January 1779, Lord Charlemont became its captain. As many new Volunteer corps were being raised throughout the county, a meeting was held at Clare on 27 December 1779, where they discussed forming these corps into battalions, with commanding officers appointed and the raising of artillery companies to complement them. This saw the creation of the Northern Battalion and Southern Battalion of the First Ulster Regiment. Unlike the volunteer militias formed earlier in the 18th century, which had Crown commissioned officers, the private members of Volunteer companies in a form of military democracy appointed their own, and were \\"subject to no Government control\\". These officers were subject to being dismissed for misconduct or incapacity. An example of Volunteers taking action against their own officers would be two officers commissioned to the Southern Battalion of the First Ulster Regiment: Thomas Dawson (commander) and Francis Dobbs (major). Both would also accept commissions in a Fencible regiment. This met with great disapproval amongst local volunteer companies who found them no longer acceptable as field officers. Lord Charlemont's own company, the First Armagh Company, even protested against the formation of Fencible regiments. By 1 January 1783, both Dawson and Dobbs had received their Fencible commissions and ceased to be volunteers. =Uniform= Of the 154 companies of Volunteers listed in The Volunteer's Companion (1794); 114 had scarlet uniforms, 18 blue, 6 green, 1 dark green, 1 white, 1 grey, 1 buff, and 12 undetailed. The details of the uniform of each corps varied depending on their choice of colouring for the facing on their uniforms, and for some the lace and buttons, amongst other pieces, for example: the Glin Royal Artillery's uniform was \\"Blue, faced blue; scarlet cuffs and capes; gold lace\\", whilst the Offerlane Blues' uniform was \\"Scarlet, faced blue; silver lace\\". The Aghavoe Loyals had \\"scarlet, faced blue\\", whilst the Castledurrow Volunteers wore green uniforms faced with white and silver lining.Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown: Miscellaneous works of the Right Honourable Henry Grattan, 1822 Lord Charlemont desired that all county companies should have the same uniform of scarlet coats with white facings, however some companies had already chosen their colours, or were in existence before his involvement. Whilst information on clothing is scant, it has been suggested that most uniforms were made locally, with badges, buttons, cloth, and hats being procured from places like Belfast and Dublin. The Belfast News Letter carried advertisements from merchants offering: plated and gilt Volunteer buttons, furnished belt and pouch plates, engravings, regimental uniform cloth, and even tents. The painting of Volunteer drums and colours was also offered. Leading Volunteer and Patriot, Henry Grattan, is recorded as wearing a blue Volunteer uniform, although in Wheatley's 1780 painting \\"\\"The Irish House of Commons: Henry Grattan urging the Claims of Irish Right, 8 June 1780\\"\\", Grattan is seen standing on the far right side of the canvas giving his speech and wearing a scarlet Volunteer uniform . =Naming= The naming of some Volunteer companies may show a continuation of earlier Protestant anti-Catholic traditions, with corps named after \\"Protestant\\" victories such as the Boyne, Aughrim and Enniskillen. Another \\"Protestant\\" victory, Culloden, the final battle of the Jacobite Rising of 1745, which saw the defeat of the Young Pretender, was used by the Culloden Volunteers of Cork company. =Reviews= Reviews of Volunteer corps were held since the earliest days of volunteering, with county companies travelling long distances to attend ones like the Belfast Reviews. Some reviews such as those in County Armagh originally were on a smaller scale, and consisted of a few companies assembling and performing field exercises in a particular district. They later became larger affairs with brigades consisting of battalions of companies. The order of the day has been recorded for the Newry Review of 1785: most of the attending companies had marched to Newry on the Thursday, the day which Lord Charlemont also arrived. On Friday the companies that formed the First Brigade assembled and marched to the review ground, where Lord Charlemont would inspect them. His arrival was announced by the firing of nine cannons. On the Saturday, the same thing happened again this time for the Second Brigade. The review also demonstrated the attack and defence of Newry. As the period of the Volunteers drew to an end, some such as those from the County Armagh Volunteers, started considering the larger reviews as a waste of time and energy. One Volunteer, Thomas Prentice, voiced a common opinion to Lord Charlemont that they would rather instead have a few companies meet a few times during the summer for drilling and improvement. In March 1793 the assembly of armed associations was prohibited, making it illegal to hold a review. The last planned review was for one near Doagh on 14 September 1793 in County Antrim. Ammunition for it had been dispatched in secret a few days prior to companies with serviceable arms so that they can resist any opposition they encountered. An hour before the review was to be held, news spread that the 38th Regiment, the Fermanagh Militia, and detachment of Artillery had arrived in Doagh, resulting in the review being abandoned with no date for resumption. Catholic emancipation The Volunteers had no unified view in regards to Catholic emancipation, and their attitude towards Catholics were not uniformly hostile. The threat posed by Catholics was deemed to be near non-existent, and that local Volunteers were \\"under no apprehensions from the Papists\\". The Volunteers exerted considerable pressure on the British government to ease the Penal Laws on Catholics such as the Relief Acts of 1778 and 1782.Bardon, Jonathan; A History of Ulster, page 214‚Äì217. The Black Staff Press, 2005. The passing of the Relief Act of 1778, resulted in the Catholic hierarchy giving their support to the British in the American War of Independence, even so far as to having fasts for the success of British arms. The war also offered a chance for Catholics to show their loyalty. As early as June 1779 this perceived lack of threat from Catholics, allowed them to be able to enlist into some Volunteer companies, and in counties Wexford and Waterford, tried to set up their own. The Catholic hierarchy however were \\"resolutely suspicious\\" of the Volunteers, even though generally Catholics \\"cheered on the Volunteers\\". At the Dungannon Convention of 1782, a resolution was passed that proclaimed the rejoice at the relaxation of the Penal Laws, whilst saying that Catholics \\"should not be completely free from restrictions\\". In contrast at Ballybay, County Monaghan, the Reverend John Rodgers addressed a meeting of Volunteers, imploring them \\"not to consent to the repeal of the penal laws, or to allow of a legal toleration of the Popish religion\\". John Wesley wrote in his Journal that the Volunteers should \\"at least keep the Papists in order\\", whilst his letter to the Freeman's Journal in 1780, which many would have agreed with, argued that he would not have the Catholics persecuted at all, but rather hindered from being able to cause harm. =County Armagh disturbances= In the 1780s sectarian tensions rose to dangerous levels in County Armagh, culminating in sectarian warfare between the Protestant Peep o' Day Boys and the Catholic Defenders that raged for over a decade.Bardon, Jonathan; A History of Ulster, page 223. The Black Staff Press, 2005. Many local Volunteers, holding partisan views, became involved in the conflict. In November 1788, the Benburb Volunteers were taunted by a \\"Catholic mob\\" near Blackwaterstown. The Benburb Volunteers then opened fire upon the Catholics, killing two and mortally wounding three others. In July 1789, the Volunteers assaulted the Defenders who had assembled at Lisnaglade Fort near Tandragee, resulting in more lives being lost. In 1797 Dr. William Richardson wrote a detailed analysis for the 1st Marquess of Abercorn, where he claimed that the troubles were caused by the excitement of volunteering during the American Revolutionary War, which gave \\"the people high confidence in their own strength\\". =Belfast 1st Volunteer Company= Outside of Ulster, Catholics found few supporters as Protestants were a minority concerned with their privileges.Bardon, Jonathan; A History of Ulster, page 217‚Äì220. The Black Staff Press, 2005. In Ulster, Protestants and Catholics were almost equal in number and sectarian rivalries remained strong, exemplified by the County Armagh disturbances. In contrast, east of the River Bann in counties Antrim and Down, the Protestants were such an \\"overwhelming majority\\" that they had little to fear from Catholics, and became their biggest defenders. According to The Volunteers Companion, printed in 1784, there were five different Volunteer companies in Belfast, the first of which was the Belfast 1st Volunteer Company formed on 17 March 1778.Bigger, Francis Joseph; The National Volunteers of Ireland, 1782, Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Second Series, Vol. 15, No. 2/3 (May 1909) Delegates from this company to the national convention of 1782 were \\"bitterly disappointed\\" that their fellow Volunteers were still opposed to giving Catholics the vote. In 1783 they became the first company of Volunteers in Ireland to \\"defiantly\\" admit Catholics into their ranks, and in May 1784 attended mass at St. Mary's chapel. Indeed, the building of this chapel was largely paid for by the Belfast 1st Volunteer Company. In sharp contrast to this, no Roman Catholic was ever admitted into a County Armagh company. In 1791, the Belfast 1st Volunteer Company passed its own resolution arguing in favour of Catholic emancipation. In October that year the Society of United Irishmen was founded, initially as an offshoot of the Volunteers. In 1792, a new radical company was created as part of the Belfast Regiment of Volunteers, the Green Company,Ulster Museum ‚Äì Henry Joy McCracken's Volunteer Coat under which guise the United Irishmen held their initial meetings. Wolfe Tone, a leading member of the United Irishmen, was elected as an honorary member of the Green Company, who he also calls the First Company, hinting that the Belfast 1st Volunteer Company reorganised itself into the Green Company. Eventually the United Irishmen would advocate revolutionary and republican ideals inspired by the French Revolution. Ironically it was only 31 years previous when Belfast had called upon volunteer militias from counties Antrim, Armagh, and Down to defend it from the French. Demise The Volunteers became less influential after the end of the war in America in 1783, and rapidly declined except in Ulster. Whilst volunteering remained of interest in counties Antrim and Down, in other places such as neighbouring County Armagh, interest was in serious decline as was membership. Internal politics too played a role in the Volunteers demise with sharp divisions of opinion regarding political affairs, possibly including \\"disapproval of the revolutionary and republican sentiments then being so freely expressed\\", especially amongst northern circles. The ultimate demise of the Volunteers occurred during 1793 with the passing of the Gunpowder Act and Convention Act, both of which \\"effectively killed off Volunteering\\",Connolly, S.J., Oxford Companion to Irish History, page 611. Oxford University Press, 2007. whilst the creation of a militia, followed by the yeomanry, served to deprive the Volunteers of their justification of being a voluntary defence force. Whilst some Volunteer members would join the United Irishmen, the majority were inclined towards the Yeomanry,Thomas Camac, Robert Day and William Cathcart; The Ulster Volunteers of 1782: Their Medals, Badges, Flags, &c.; (Continued), Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Second Series, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Jan. 1900). which was used to help put down the United Irishmen's rebellion in 1798. Some of these United Irishmen and Yeomen had received their military training in the same Volunteer company; for example, the Ballymoney company's Alexander Gamble became a United Irishman, whilst George Hutcinson, a captain in the company, joined the Yeomanry. Legacy It was the Volunteers of 1782 that launched a paramilitary tradition in Irish politics, a tradition, whether nationalist or unionist, has continued to shape Irish political activity with the ethos of \\"the force of argument had been trumped by the argument of force\\". The Volunteers of the 18th century set a precedent for using the threat of armed force to influence political reform. George Washington, also a member of the landed gentry, had written about them: \\"Patriots of Ireland, your cause is our own\\". While their political aims were limited, and their legacy was ambiguous, combining future elements of both Irish nationalism and Irish unionism. The Ulster Volunteers founded in 1912 to oppose Irish Home Rule, made frequent reference to the Irish Volunteers, and attempted to link its activities with theirs. They shared many features such as regional strength, leadership, and a Protestant recruitment base. The Irish Volunteers, formed in November 1913, were in part inspired and modeled on the Ulster Volunteers,Jackson, Alvin; Home Rule - An Irish History 1800‚Äì2000, page 120. Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2003. . Quote: The UVF was a direct inspiration for the Irish Volunteers, formed in November 1913 by those on the nationalist side who feared that Home Rule had stalled. but its founders, including Eoin MacNeill and Patrick Pearse, also drew heavily upon the legacy of the 18th- century Volunteers. Renowned Irish historian and writer James Camlin Beckett, stated that when the Act of Union between Great Britain and Ireland was being debated in the Parliament of Ireland throughout 1800, that the \\"national spirit of 1782 was dead\\". Despite this, Henry Grattan, who had helped secure the Irish parliament's legislative independence in 1782, bought Wicklow borough at midnight for ¬£1,200, and after dressing in his old Volunteer uniform, arrived at the House of Commons of the Irish parliament at 7 a.m., after which he gave a two-hour speech against the proposed union. Denis McCullough and Bulmer Hobson of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) established the Dungannon Clubs in 1905 ... \\"to celebrate those icons of the constitutionalist movement, the Irish Volunteers of 1782\\".Charles Townshend, Easter 1916, The Irish Rebellion (2006), p18 MacNeill stated of the original Volunteers, \\"the example of the former Volunteers (of 1782) is not that they did not fight but that they did not maintain their organisation till their objects had been secured\\". One of the mottos used by the Volunteer's Quis Separabit, meaning \\"who shall separate us\\", which was in use by them from at least 1781,Day, Robert; On Three Gold Medals of the Irish Volunteers, The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Fifth Series, Vol. 10, No.4 (31 December 1900). is also used by the Order of St. Patrick (founded in 1783), and is used by several Irish British Army regiments such as the Royal Dragoon Guards, Royal Ulster Rifles (previously Royal Irish Rifles), 4th Royal Irish Dragoon Guards, 88th Regiment of Foot (Connaught Rangers) and its successor the Connaught Rangers. It was also adopted by the anti-Home Rule organisation, the Ulster Defence Union, and is also the motto of the paramilitary Ulster Defence Force. References Sources * Stewart, A.T.Q. (1998).

Pacay trees, as is the case with other trees in genus Inga, also produce pods that contain an edible white pulp and have nitrogen-fixing roots. Description Pacay is a medium to large sized tree up to tall. Indumentum of pubescent hairs with rusty color on young branchlets, leaf rhachis and inflorescences. Leaves have 3-5 pairs of oblong- elliptic leaflets, with a terminal leaflet of ca. 10‚Äì20 cm long. Inflorescences in spikes to 3 cm long. Pods, flat, 20 cm long or more. In English they have been called \\"ice-cream beans\\" due to the sweet flavor and smooth texture of the pulp. Naturally growing Inga trees produce abundant root nodules, which fix nitrogen, thus adding nitrogen to the soil rather than taking it away, hence benefitting the land by increasing fertility levels. Inga feuilleei is a legume tree that is medium to large in length. Its height can reach an average of 60 feet or taller and will stand temperatures as high as 30 degree Celsius when mature. At low temperatures, these trees are often damaged. These trees generally occur near river banks, so it has year round irrigation. Inga species are dependable, they produce in abundance, and they provide sustenance in bad times. A family can produce food without occupying the farmland used for food crops, because they can grow on sites neglected by agriculture. They grow rapidly, are tolerant of diverse soils, and are resistant to disease and fire. These trees are easy to establish, spread their shade quickly, and provide fruit for years. The fruits of the trees are quite edible and are often consumed by people of regions where this fruit grows. In Mexico, coffee-plantation workers can double their annual salary by selling the pods from the Inga trees used to shade the coffee plants. In Central America, the seeds are cooked and eaten as a vegetable. In Mexico, the seeds are roasted and sold outside theaters to moviegoers. In Costa Rica, the fruit is also known as Guaba, and is associated with good luck.

It aired on Fox in the United States on January 29, 2006, and is written by Neal Boushell and Sam O'Neal and directed by Albert Calleros. In the episode, despite Stan's objections, Francine realizes a long-standing dream of opening a kiosk at the Langley Falls Mall to sell her muffins, while Hayley becomes an eco-warrior to fight the mall's expansion. Meanwhile, Stan decides to give Klaus a new human body so Klaus can cook for him; and Steve thinks he's a werewolf. Plot After receiving a hefty bonus from work, Stan buys extravagant gadgets while Francine pleads for her dream kiosk at the mall. Upset about his lack of support, Francine opens a muffin shop without his approval and gives Stan a taste of life without a housewife. In a desperate move, Stan puts Klaus' brain back into a human body - that of the frontman of an Earth, Wind & Fire cover band who was abducted by the CIA in retaliation for ripping them off at the summer mixer - thinking that Klaus will cook breakfast for him only to discover it was a huge mistake as Klaus takes Stan hostage, steals Stan's cash and then gets rid of his former goldfish body by flushing it down the toilet. Klaus then sets out to win over Francine. Meanwhile, Steve is convinced he's a teen werewolf after watching a horror film and being attacked randomly by a wolf. In actuality, Roger adopted a wolf from the woods (after accidentily killing his sea monkeys), named it \\"Felicity\\" and, in the night, it killed another animal and covered Steve's room with blood. Another night, Steve and his friends go into the woods for his friends to kill him with a silver bullet; the actual wolf shows up and, in a confusing situation, they wind up thinking a silver bullet restored Steve to his normal self and separated the wolf from his body. Klaus, after some quick preparations, seduces Francine at the mall before Stan arrives, revealing the ruse; but an eco-terrorist friend of Hayley sets off a series of bombs, blowing up a statue of Chief Shop-a-holic in the mall. Klaus dives out of the way to protect his new body; Stan, however, pushes Francine out of the way, but the statue piece hits his clock necklace of Stan's, ruining it but keeping Francine and Stan safe. Hayley's eco-terrorist friend is then placed under arrest. Francine becomes proud that Stan had saved her, and they reconcile. Klaus' body is half-crushed by a large piece of the statue, and near death he pleads with Stan to save his life. Francine also pleads with Stan to save Klaus' life, thinking he has learned his lesson about attempting adultery. Stan says the CIA has no more abducted people, so he purchases a goldfish from the mall pet shop and places Klaus' mind in it to save his life. Reception Ryan Budke of AOL TV gave the episode a negative review, saying \\"Ever wondered what Klaus the goldfish would look like as a black man? Neither did I, but I had never really been posed that question before. I think if someone asked me that I would have wondered... Well, whether you've had those sick thoughts before or not, you got the answer to that question during last night's episode of American Dad. I have a feeling that American Dad is hitting it's stride, which is probably not a good thing. The show is going ok, but it's nothing spectacular, and far, far short of its potential. It's always going to be the second banana to Family Guy. It's not a bad show by any means, but American Dad will never be as good as Family Guy. On with the show!\\"http://www.aoltv.com/2006/01/30/american-dad-finances-with-wolves/ Daniel Solomon of Cinema Blend gave the episode a mixed review, saying \\"This is the only time in the series where I was not angered to the point of cutting myself by Roger‚Äôs annoying shtick.

The one locomotive produced was numbered #5800 and used in regular Baltimore tunnel helper service until it was scrapped in September 1962. Design, construction and testing On May 21, 1937, a meeting was held in Philadelphia to outline the design of a new electric freight locomotive. The meeting was attended by the PRR and Baldwin, as well as electrical suppliers General Electric and Westinghouse, and the transportation engineering firm Gibbs & Hill, who were consultants on the proposal to extend electrification to Pittsburgh. The locomotive being designed was what became the DD2. Technical details Although the design specified either passenger gearing or freight gearing, the prototype was only ever used with freight gearing. Its wheel arrangement was 4-4-0+0-4-4 in the Whyte notation, or 2-B+B-2 in the AAR's system. It had two frames, hinged together in the middle, with the driving wheels and motors mounted directly to each frame, two pairs per side.

South Park was served by three mayors in its four-and-one-half years of existence as an independent town: S. J. Bevan (1902‚Äì1903), G. C. Lingenfelter (1903‚Äì1905), and A. G. Breidenstein (1906‚Äì1907). South Park was plagued by problems in securing adequate city services. Particularly vexing was the inability to obtain a decent water supply. Although the city of Georgetown owned water mains that ran through South Park, it refused to supply water to the latter, starting a bitter court battle over legal rights to the water. In 1905‚Äì1906, the town contracted with an independent water company, but in April 1906 the water was found to be contaminated because South Park did not have a sewer system. The Town Council petitioned Seattle to run Cedar River mains to the edge of the town and has had clean water since. The City of Seattle provides sewage services in modern South Park.

It is possible that Vladimir Nabokov drew on the details of her case in writing his famous novel Lolita. Abduction In early 1948, Sally Horner, a 5th grade student in Camden, New Jersey, attempted to shoplift a notebook from a five-and-dime store after a group of girls at her school told her to do it to be accepted into their social clique. Sally's mother was a young widow; her step-father had committed suicide when she was six years old. So, although she was an honor student, she grew up in meager circumstances and was somewhat of a social outcast eager for any opportunity to fit in. She was quickly confronted by a man who identified himself as an FBI agent and told her that she would be in a great deal of trouble for stealing the notebook and might end up in reform school. In fact, the man was Frank La Salle, a 50-year-old mechanic who had an extensive rap sheet for molesting girls between the ages of 11 and 14 and had been released from prison only six months earlier. La Salle instructed Horner that he would have to monitor her from now on, and she believed him. Three months later, La Salle confronted Horner while she was walking home from school and told her that she would have to come with him to Atlantic City by order of the FBI. He instructed her to tell her mother that he was the father of two of her school friends and she had been invited on their family vacation to the New Jersey shore. Horner's mother Ella did not question if La Salle was telling the truth and gave her approval to the trip. Since she could not afford to take her daughter on a summer vacation herself, she was willing to let her have the opportunity with someone else. La Salle began presenting the two in public as a father and daughter and Horner made regular phone calls to her mother, who still believed she was vacationing with a family friend, but by the end of July the her mother began feeling that something was amiss and contacted police, who issued a missing child alert in New Jersey and several surrounding states. La Salle fled Atlantic City with Horner and took her to Baltimore, where he raped her. Afterwards, Horner was raped repeatedly, with La Salle using the constant threat of reporting Horner's shoplifting to get her to submit to his demands. When police searched the Atlantic City boarding house where the pair had stayed, they found an undated photograph of Horner on a swingset. This was widely circulated in the press; since Ella Horner did not recognize the photo, it may have been taken by La Salle at some point. With the new school year starting at the end of August, La Salle enrolled Horner in a Baltimore Catholic school under a pseudonym and they continued to live there for the next six months. In March 1949, Camden police indicted La Salle in absentia for kidnapping, so he and Horner fled the area and moved far away to Dallas, Texas. During this entire time, Horner still believed La Salle was an FBI agent. After arriving in Dallas, they took up residence in a trailer park and Horner began attending another Catholic school under a pseudonym. A neighbor, Ruth Janisch, became suspicious of the pair and questioned Horner about the true nature of their relationship, but she would not say. Soon afterward, Janisch and her husband moved to San Jose, California, but she still believed something was amiss. After moving, she wrote to La Salle about job opportunities in San Jose and suggested that he come there. Although Horner had resisted telling Janisch her secret, she eventually admitted it to a classmate in Dallas. The girl told her that what she and La Salle were doing was wrong and that they should stop immediately, and, as she later told police, \\"I began to reject his advances after that.\\" In early 1950, La Salle and Horner headed to San Jose. where they met up with the Janisches. Soon afterwards, while La Salle was away job searching, Horner confessed the truth to Ruth Janisch and told her she missed her mother and wanted to go home. Janisch invited Horner to make a long-distance phone call to her older sister in New Jersey, after which they contacted police, who took Horner to a children's shelter and arrested La Salle when he returned home. He offered no resistance, but continued to maintain that he was Horner's father, which was disproven when police performed record checks in Camden and found that her real father had been dead for seven years. Questioned by police, Horner was reluctant to acknowledge that she had been raped many times during the course of her 21-month captivity, but eventually admitted it and also told them that she believed she would go to prison for shoplifting if she didn't comply with La Salle's sexual demands. She recounted that she had served a sort of \\"housewife\\" role for her captor, in addition to providing him with sex, she also cooked their meals and performed household chores in the various lodgings they'd stayed in. Horner was reunited with her mother in Camden and attempted to resume her life after 21 months of captivity; 11 years old when she was abducted, she had celebrated her 12th birthday while she and La Salle were in Texas and was a few weeks shy of 13 when she returned home. La Salle was convicted under the Mann Act (White-Slave Traffic Act). During his trial, he refused any legal defense and pleaded guilty to all charges. Horner was not asked to testify at the trial. La Salle was sentenced to 35 years in prison. He served his sentence in the New Jersey State Penitentary in Trenton, where he died in 1967 at the age of 69. During his prison sentence, La Salle filed repeated, unsuccessful appeals in addition to turning down legal counsel and attempting to act as his own attorney. He even sent a bouquet of flowers to Horner's funeral, which her family did not put out on display.Book excerpt, The Last Days of the Real Lolita What happened after Sally Horner, whose story helped inspire the novel, returned home, The Cut, 06 September 2018 Death Camden County prosecutor Mitchell Cohen recommended that Horner and her mother leave the area and start a new life elsewhere under assumed names, but they declined and attempted to resume their lives as usual. Horner experienced a difficult readjustment to her normal life--mental health care for victims of sex crimes was limited at the time and she experienced frequent taunting and abuse from classmates who accused her of deliberately provoking her kidnapper's attention. Two years later, in August 1952, the now 15-year-old Horner went on a summer trip to the New Jersey shore with a friend. Using a fake ID to pass herself off as a 21-year-old, a common practice among teenagers in that era to get into age-restricted restaurants and entertainment venues, she began dating a 20-year-old man named Edward Baker, telling him she was 17. While riding in Baker's 1951 Ford on the evening of August 18, Horner was killed when Baker slammed into the rear of a parked truck that he had been unable to see in the darkness. Baker escaped with lacerations and a few broken bones, but Horner suffered massive, fatal injuries to her head, neck, and chest when the rear bumper of the truck smashed into the passenger compartment of the Ford. She was buried in the family plot in New Egypt, New Jersey. As the Associated Press reported on August 20, 1952: \\"Florence Sally Horner, a 15-year-old Camden, N.J., girl who spent 21 months as the captive of a middle- aged morals offender a few years ago, was killed in a highway accident when the car in which she was riding plowed into the rear of a parked truck.\\" Cultural references Critic Alexander Dolinin proposed in 2005 that Frank La Salle and Florence Sally Horner were the real-life prototypes of Humbert Humbert and Dolores \\"Lolita\\" Haze from Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov. Sarah Weinman's book The Real Lolita also alleges that Horner's ordeal inspired Lolita. Although Nabokov had already used the same basic idea--that of a child molester and his victim booking into a hotel as father and daughter--in his then unpublished 1939 work Volshebnik (–í–æ–ª—à–µ–±–Ω–∏–∫), it is still possible that he drew on the details of the Horner case in writing Lolita. An English translation of Volshebnik was published in 1985 as The Enchanter. Nabokov explicitly mentions the Horner case in Chapter 33, Part II of Lolita: \\"Had I done to Dolly, perhaps, what Frank Lasalle, a fifty-year-old mechanic, had done to eleven-year-old Sally Horner in 1948?\\" See also *List of kidnappings Further reading * * References Category:1937 births Category:1940s missing person cases Category:1952 deaths Category:Child sexual abuse in the United States Category:Formerly missing people Category:Kidnapped American children Category:Missing person cases in New Jersey Category:Muses Category:Rapes in the United States Category:Road incident deaths in New Jersey Category:Violence against children ","title":"Florence Sally Horner"},{"id":"3629682","title":"Doina Melinte"},{"id":"3629698","text":"Newport Church Newport ( or formerly Tulach Sheasta) is a town in County Tipperary in Ireland.

The Newport River, a tributary of the Mulcair (or Mulkear) River and it flows through the middle of the town where it is joined by the Cully River. Newport is nestled in the foothills of Silvermine mountain range. The highest of these mountains is Keeper Hill a well-used local hiking and walking area. It is close to Lough Derg and the villages of Murroe, Killaloe and Ballina. History The original settlement in Newport dates back centuries before the Norman invasions. After the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland, Richard Warren Waller acquired Cully Castle sometime in the 1650s. He was the son of Edward Waller and Margaret Glascoke. He was granted of land in the vicinity. After the war the castle was in ruins and was rebuilt as Castle Waller. A townland still bears that name. He died in 1676.http://www.thepeerage.com/p22592.htm#i225915 Vice-Admiral Robert Otway http://www.thepeerage.com/p7341.htm#i73406 and Sir Arthur Otway, 3rd Baronet along with the other Waller baronets are direct descendants. During this time the settlement was changed from the Irish name Tulach Sheasta to the English Newport. There were two churches in the town. The (Church of Ireland) Church of St. John's, built in 1766, had been the major church in Newport until the building of a 'Mass house' was completed by the end of the 18th century after the relaxing of the penal laws. The Catholic church called St John's is located on Chapel Lane and built circa 1796.http://www.buildingsofireland.ie/niah/search.jsp?type=record&county;=TN&regno;=22311012 The last service in the Anglican (Church of Ireland) church also called St John's was held in 1964 and the church was later demolished. The church graveyard remains. It is located on Church Road. The town contains an old courthouse and a jail called the Bridewell, built in 1862‚Äì63 on land owned by Sir Edward Waller. The Courthouse was used for the trial of minor offences; on occasion it was used for preliminary hearings for more serious crimes, before they were referred to a higher circuit court. The building contains eight cells, two day rooms and two limestone staircases. It remains today on Jail street and now houses the Peter Dee Academy of Music. During the War of Independence Newport was the scene of various incidents including the shaving of a woman's head for keeping company of policemen and the burning down of several business premises (Cullen's Shop and Daly's Public House) and houses (Clareview former Charter School). The RIC barracks moved from the center of the village to Clareview. On 15 May the Newport brigade planned an attack on District Inspector Harold Biggs. He was ambushed at Coolboreen returning from dinner at the Barrington family shooting lodge, Glenculloo Lodge, on the river in the foothills of Keeper Hill. He was shot and killed in the ambush together with Winifred Barrington, daughter of Sir Charles Barrington of what was then Glenstal Castle and now Glenstal Abbey. Among the members of the raiding party was Patrick Ryan, after whom the Newport GAA pitch is named. On being reprimanded by another female present who was present in the car for shooting at a woman, Lacken replied \\"It served them right, and only for the b***h being in bad company, she would not be shot. Also killed were Sgt John Walsh of the RIC and Patrick Gilligan a former soldier was shot on 22 May 1922. This was after the treaty had been signed. Education There are two primary schools (Convent of Mercy Primary School and the Boys' National School) in the town and two second level schools (St Mary's Secondary School and St Joseph's College).

An early modern era Napa Valley presence and pioneering exponent of French oak, the estate enjoys a historical renown with the success of its Martha's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon, and has also been described as a \\"master of Grignolino\\". History The estate was established in 1961 by Joseph (Joe) and Alice Heitz, during a period when the population of Napa Valley wineries had been reduced to the lowest of its decline since the Prohibition of near two dozen, at what is recognized as the turning point of Napa's wine industry. =Joe Heitz= Born in Princeton, Illinois, Heitz moved to Jack Murphy Stadium while enlisted in the U.S. Air Force. Following World War II, Heitz began taking classes at UC Davis, achieving a bachelor and eventually a master's degree in viticulture and enology, in 1951 in the first graduating class of seven to do so.Farmer, Lyn, The Wine News (June/July 2006). Those '70s Guys - California's Most Influential Winemaking Generation Heitz found employment under the wine industry extremes, first at Gallo, and then in 1951 under Andr√© Tchelistcheff at Beaulieu Vineyard as an assistant winemaker where he worked for near ten years.Kissack, Chris, thewinedoctor.com Heitz Wine Cellars Having worked as a professor at the enology program at California State University, Fresno for four years, in 1961, Heitz and his wife Alice bought a small vineyard from Leon Brendel named \\"The One & Only\\" for $5,000 planted with Grignolino, and went into business for himself,Prial, Frank J., The New York Times (December 23, 2000). Joseph Heitz, 81, a Standout In California WinemakingVines & Wines (February 2001). Joseph E. Heitz Dies At 81 his winemaking production preceding Robert Mondavi's emergence in Oakville. In 1963 Heitz bought at an auction several barrels of Chardonnay and Pinot noir wine from Hanzell Vineyards in Sonoma, the last vintages of the deceased owner James D. Zellerbach's pursuit of Burgundian excellence sold off by his widow. Heitz blended the wines with success, achieving lucrative prices for the times. A stated strategy for success was to pay growers \\"what their grapes were worth\\", in turn increasing the standard of the product he was receiving. In 1964, Heitz acquired an 1898 stone winery with its ranch property, which became the Heitz winery and home,Carson, L. Pierce, Napa Valley Register (June 6, 2008). Heitz family chairs 28th wine auction with the original winery retained as a visitor's centre. Heitz Wine Cellars vineyards in Napa Valley Heitz holds an exclusive agreement with Tom and Martha May, owners of the Martha's Vineyard in the Oakville AVA since the first purchase of fruit in 1965 which Heitz blended with other Cabernet, an act considered Heitz' great breakthrough. In recognizing the quality of the grapes, from the 1966 vintage Heitz first vinified the fruit separately and designated the vineyard on the label. Heitz is considered the first to champion the single vineyard designation in the U.S.Gerien, J. Scott, Wine Business (April 15, 2003). The Vineyard Designation Later, the 1968 vintage received attention for its quality, widely considered the greatest wine made in America up to that time. It had been American oak vats, transferred to Limousin barrels where it aged for further two years. Frank J. Prial contended the wine remained \\"the benchmark by which California cabernets were judged\\" for more than two decades. Since 1976, a similar exclusivity agreement has existed with Barney and Belle Rhodes, owners of the Bella Oaks Vineyard in the Rutherford AVA. Following a review by Robert Parker where he wrote about Martha's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon that it \\"lacked aroma\\", Joe Heitz sent Parker a box of linen handkerchiefs, insinuating to the critic that he ought to clear his nose.Goldfarb, Alan, appellationamerica.com (September 3, 2007). Heitz and Seek Joe Heitz suffered a stroke in 1996 which left him frail though lucid. He died on December 16, 2000, aged 81. He was described by Warren Winiarski as the first of the Napa Valley artisans and the first to grasp the single vineyard concept.Carson, L. Pierce, Napa Valley Register (January 3, 2001). Wine pioneer joe heitz dies at 81 =Modern era= Born in 1950, David Heitz succeeded his father as winemaker in the late 1970s, having worked at the estate for many years. In 1984 the estate purchased the Trailside Vineyard in Rutherford, having previously purchased fruit from the site, introduced as a single vineyard bottling in 1989. During the late 1980s and early 90s there were reports of TCA taint, or in alternate claims Brettanomyces yeast infection, in the Heitz cellars that were eventually overcome, and Tom Stevenson has criticized American wine writers for not daring to \\"tell the late king he had no clothes on at the time\\". In the early 90s, the Bella Oaks Vineyard suffered from the disease eutypa and replanting became necessary. No 1991 and 1992 vintages were made of this cuv√©e. Also in the early 90s, phylloxera afflicted Martha's Vineyard, and no vintages were made in the mid-1990s. Competitions The 1970 Heitz Wine Cellars Martha's Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon appeared in several wine tasting competitions, including the \\"Judgment of Paris\\" tasting, where it placed ninth out of the ten red wines,Asher, Gerald, Gourmet (January 1997).

The Keeseekoowenin Ojibway First Nation reserve is located just to the north, around the former Riding Mountain House trading post of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC). History Elphinstone was named after Lord Elphinstone, who came about 1880 as a guest of Robert Campbell, chief factor of the HBC, and bought about of land on the Little Saskatchewan River.Rudnyckyj, J.B.

McDonald as first postmaster. Elphinstone is home to a unique regional breed of sheep, the Lord Elphinstone Burdock, commonly \\"Elphinstone Burries\\" or just \\"Burries\\". The breed has direct links to Lord Elphinstone, as it was inspired by his speech made during his celebrated 1880 visit. While there is a little bit of debate about the matter, some holding that what Lord Elphinstone said was in reference to his observation of a scene on the train platform involving local James Murdoch's attempt to assess Gloria Booth's rendition of what she thought the most recent style of continental bodices, most agreed that what he must have muttered while the train slowed referred to the most obvious natural features of the landscape. At any rate \\"Good for [only] burdock and sheep\\" just seemed more inspirational than \\"Murdoch that creep\\" and so became the mantra of local herdsmen. Before long a local breed was established that embodied all the known qualities of the town's namesake. Stupid to an amazing degree, easily led, wondrously unable to care for itself and prickly to the touch the \\"Burries\\" do amazingly well grazing the local scrub, so long as you keep them away from sharp objects, dogs, large cats, loud noises, objects they could become entangled in, anything hard they might repeatedly ram their heads into, and mice.

The station is on the South Western Main Line. It is down the line from Railways in the United Kingdom historically are measured in miles and chains. There are 80 chains to one mile. and is situated between and . The station is managed by South Western Railway, who operate all trains serving it.  History  A 1937 Ordnance Survey showing the location of Dorchester South and Dorchester West The station opened on 1 June 1847 when the Southampton and Dorchester Railway was completed. The station was built as an east facing terminus with the intent of continuing the line westwards towards Exeter. These plans were never realised, and instead another line was built from the terminus towards Weymouth. This joined with the Great Western Railway's line (now the Heart of Wessex Line) from Dorchester West and continued as a joint line to Weymouth. Originally named Dorchester, the station was renamed Dorchester South on 26 September 1949. The station remained a terminus with trains from Bournemouth having to enter the station, reverse out back the way they came then reverse again and proceed to Weymouth. Trains from Weymouth had to pass the station, then reverse into it, and then back out. This process often caused delays and brought criticism following an accident in 1877. As a result, a curved platform was provided for southbound trains; this was brought into use during 1878. Eastbound trains still reversed into the original platform until 1970 when a platform was built on the curve. The buildings on the trackless original platform remained in use until 1989. As part of the modernisation work preparatory to electrification a new booking hall was built on the curved platform, replacing the building on the original platform which was then demolished. =Motive power depot= The Southampton and Dorchester Railway constructed a motive power depot at the station in 1847 together with a coal stage and turntable. This closed in 1957 and was demolished soon afterwards.  Plans  Although the current station was rebuilt only in 1989, there are plans for a new station on the current site in the coming years. Also, the Eldridge Pope Brewery site is being redeveloped with hotels, apartments and houses. It is planned to turn the station into the first ever solar-powered railway station in Britain. This would take several years to come into action, but the station would not change drastically: the building on Platform 1 would have a new solar panel as a roof. As part of a modernisation scheme of the station, during late 2010/early 2011, CCTV monitor podiums were installed on platform 1 (similar to those used on the London Underground) so as to allow the guards of each London-bound train have easier visuals of the platforms (because platform 1 has a tight curve, and makes it difficult to see the length of the platform whilst a train is in the vicinity of the station. New entrances have also been constructed from the southern end of platform 1 to the adjacent car park, as well as new waiting shelters built near the new entrance, as well as on the site of the former brick hut on platform 2.  Services  A Class 442 train from London Waterloo at Dorchester South in 2006 The station is served by South Western Railway. Services originate from London Waterloo or Weymouth Station on the South Western Main Line and are most commonly operated by Class 444 but are sometimes served by Class 450 electric multiple units during times of engineering work (i.e. when they are not required for use on lines near Portsmouth) or at peak times. The basic frequency is 2 trains per hour each way (though not at even intervals) on weekdays and hourly on Sundays.

It is listed as Near Threatened on the IUCN Red List because the population is thought to be declining significantly due to habitat loss and hunting for meat. Characteristics Male goral in Rajaji NP The Himalayan goral is in length and weighs . It has a gray or gray-brown coat with tan legs, lighter patches on its throat, and a single dark stripe along its spine. Males have short manes on their necks. Both males and females have backward- curving horns which can grow up to in length. In addition to certain peculiarities in the form of the skull, gorals are chiefly distinguished from the closely related serows in that they do not possess preorbital glands below their eyes, nor corresponding depressions in their skulls. Distribution and habitat Himalayan gorals are found in the forests of the Himalayas including Bhutan, northern India including Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, Nepal, southern Tibet, and possibly western Myanmar. They inhabit most of the southern slopes of the Himalayas from Jammu and Kashmir to eastern Arunachal Pradesh. In India and Nepal they are present at elevations from . In Pakistan they have been recorded from altitude but their present occurrence in Punjab is doubtful. Group home range size is typically around , with males occupying marked territories of during the mating season.

The animal is crepuscular, being most active in the early morning and late evening. After a morning meal, it often drinks and then rests on a rock ledge through the day. It feeds on leaves and associated softer parts of plants, mainly grasses.Fakhar-i-Abbas, F., Akhtar, T., Mian, A. (2008).

The Himalayan goral is very agile and can run quickly. Due to its coloration it is very well camouflaged, so that it is extremely difficult to sight it, especially since it spends much of the day lying still. However, it is hunted by various predators, notably the Himalayan wolf. When threatened, the Himalayan goral will vocalize with hissing or sneezing sounds. Himalayan goral can live for 14 or 15 years. The female gives birth after a gestation period of 170‚Äì218 days, usually to a single offspring. The young are weaned at 7 or 8 months of age and reach sexual maturity at around 3 years.  Conservation  Naemorhedus goral is listed in CITES Appendix I.

The absence of air or other gases prevents oxidation, heat loss from the product through convection, and removes a source of contamination. This enables the furnace to heat materials (typically metals and ceramics) to temperatures as high as with select materials. Maximum furnace temperatures and vacuum levels depend on melting points and vapor pressures of heated materials. Vacuum furnaces are used to carry out processes such as annealing, brazing, sintering and heat treatment with high consistency and low contamination. Characteristics of a vacuum furnace are: * Uniform temperatures in the range. * Commercially available vacuum pumping systems can reach vacuum levels as low as * Temperature can be controlled within a heated zone, typically surrounded by heat shielding or insulation. * Low contamination of the product by carbon, oxygen and other gases. * Vacuum pumping systems remove low temperature by-products from the process materials during heating, resulting in a higher purity end product. * Quick cooling (quenching) of product can be used to shorten process cycle times. * The process can be computer controlled to ensure repeatability. Heating metals to high temperatures in open to atmosphere normally causes rapid oxidation, which is undesirable. A vacuum furnace removes the oxygen and prevents this from happening. An inert gas, such as Argon, is often used to quickly cool the treated metals back to non-metallurgical levels (below ) after the desired process in the furnace. This inert gas can be pressurized to two times atmosphere or more, then circulated through the hot zone area to pick up heat before passing through a heat exchanger to remove heat. This process continues until the desired temperature is reached. Common uses Vacuum furnaces are used in a wide range of applications in both production industries and research laboratories. At temperatures below 1200 ¬∞C, a vacuum furnace is commonly used for the heat treatment of steel alloys. Many general heat treating applications involve the hardening and tempering of a steel part to make it strong and tough through service. Hardening involves heating the steel to a predetermined temperature, then cooling it rapidly in water, oil or suitable medium. A further application for vacuum furnaces is Vacuum Carburizing also known as Low Pressure Carburizing or LPC. In this process, a gas (such as acetylene) is introduced as a partial pressure into the hot zone at temperatures typically between . The gas disassociates into its constituent elements (in this case carbon and hydrogen). The carbon is then diffused into the surface area of the part. This function is typically repeated, varying the duration of gas input and diffusion time. Once the workload is properly \\"cased\\", the metal is quenched using oil or high pressure gas (HPGQ). For HPGQ, nitrogen or, for faster quench helium, is commonly used. This process is also known as case hardening. Another low temperature application of vacuum furnaces is debinding, a process for the removal of binders. Heat is applied under a vacuum in a sealed chamber, melting or vaporizing the binder from the aggregate. The binder is evacuated by the pumping system and collected or purged downstream. The material with a higher melting point is left behind in a purified state and can be further processed. Vacuum furnaces capable of temperatures above 1200 ¬∞C are used in various industry sectors such as electronics, medical, crystal growth, energy and artificial gems. The processing of high temperature materials, both of metals and nonmetals, in a vacuum environment allows annealing, brazing, purification, sintering and other processes to take place in a controlled manner.

Despite an initial Arab presence in Sindh, the development of Indo-Islamic architecture began in earnest with the establishment of Delhi as the capital of the Ghurid dynasty in 1193.Harle, 423-424 Succeeding the Ghurids was the Delhi Sultanate, a series of Central Asian dynasties that consolidated much of North India, and later the Mughal Empire by the 15th century. Both of these dynasties introduced Persianate, Turkic and Islamicate architecture and art styles from Western Eurasia into the Indian subcontinent.Yale, 164-165 The types and forms of large buildings required by Muslim elites, with mosques and tombs much the most common, were very different from those previously built in India. The exteriors of both were very often topped by large domes, and made extensive use of arches. Both of these features were hardly used in Hindu temple architecture and other indigenous Indian styles. Both types of building essentially consist of a single large space under a high dome, and completely avoid the figurative sculpture so important to Hindu temple architecture.Harle, 421, 425; Yale, 165; Blair & Bloom, 149 Islamic buildings initially adapted the skills of a workforce trained in earlier Indian traditions to their own designs. Unlike most of the Islamic world, where brick tended to predominate, India had highly skilled builders well used to producing stone masonry of extremely high quality.Harle, 424; Yale, 165 Alongside the architecture developed in Delhi and prominent centres of Mughal culture such as Agra, Lahore and Allahabad, a variety of regional styles developed in regional kingdoms like the Bengal, Gujarat, Deccan, Jaunpur and Kashmir Sultanates. By the Mughal period, generally agreed to represent the peak of the style, aspects of Islamic style began to influence architecture made for Hindus, with even temples using scalloped arches, and later domes. This was especially the case in palace architecture. Following the collapse of the Mughal Empire, regional nawabs such as in Lucknow, Hyderabad and Mysore continued to commission and patronize the construction of Mughal-style architecture in the princely states. Indo-Islamic architecture has left a large impact on modern Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi architecture, as in the case of its influence on the Indo-Saracenic Revivalism of the late British Raj. Both secular and religious buildings are influenced by Indo-Islamic architecture. Architecture of the Delhi Sultanate The Qutb Minar (left, begun c. 1200) next to the Alai Darwaza gatehouse (1311); Qutb Complex in Delhi The best-preserved example of a mosque from the days of the infancy of Islam in South Asia is the ruined mosque at Banbhore in Sindh, Pakistan, from the year 727, from which only the plan can be deduced.Port of Banbhore, UNESCO Tentative list; Yale, 28-29 The start of the Delhi Sultanate in 1206 under Qutb al-Din Aibak introduced a large Islamic state to India, using Central Asian styles.Harle, 423-424 The important Qutb Complex in Delhi was begun under Muhammad of Ghor, by 1199, and continued under Qutb al-Din Aibak and later sultans. The Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque, now a ruin, was the first structure. Like other early Islamic buildings it re-used elements such as columns from destroyed Hindu and Jain temples, including one on the same site whose platform was reused. The style was Iranian, but the arches were still corbelled in the traditional Indian way.Yale, 164-165; Harle, 423-424; Blair & Bloom, 149 Beside it is the extremely tall Qutb Minar, a minaret or victory tower, whose original four stages reach 73 meters (with a final stage added later). Its closest comparator is the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c.1190, a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.Also two huge minarets at Ghazni. The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns; in Delhi the shaft is fluted with \\"superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies\\" at the top of each stage.Yale, 164; Harle, 424 (quoted); Blair & Bloom, 149 In general minarets were slow to be used in India, and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.Harle, 429 The Tomb of Iltutmish was added by 1236; its dome, the squinches again corbelled, is now missing, and the intricate carving has been described as having an \\"angular harshness\\", from carvers working in an unfamiliar tradition.Yale, 164 (quoted); Harle, 425 Other elements were added to the complex over the next two centuries. Another very early mosque, begun in the 1190s, is the Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra in Ajmer, Rajasthan, built for the same Delhi rulers, again with corbelled arches and domes. Here Hindu temple columns (and possibly some new ones) are piled up in threes to achieve extra height. Both mosques had large detached screens with pointed corbelled arches added in front of them, probably under Iltutmish a couple of decades later. In these the central arch is taller, in imitation of an iwan. At Ajmer the smaller screen arches are tentatively cusped, for the first time in India.Blair & Bloom, 149-150; Harle, 425 Tomb of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq (d. 1325), Delhi By around 1300 true domes and arches with voussoirs were being built; the ruined Tomb of Balban (d. 1287) in Delhi may be the earliest survival.Harle, 425 The Alai Darwaza gatehouse at the Qutb complex, from 1311, still shows a cautious approach to the new technology, with very thick walls and a shallow dome, only visible from a certain distance or height. Bold contrasting colours of masonry, with red sandstone and white marble, introduce what was to become a common feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, substituting for the polychrome tiles used in Persia and Central Asia. The pointed arches come together slightly at their base, giving a mild horseshoe arch effect, and their internal edges are not cusped but lined with conventionalized \\"spearhead\\" projections, possibly representing lotus buds. Jali, stone openwork screens, are introduced here; they already had been long used in temples.Blair & Bloom, 151 =Tughlaq architecture= The tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam (built 1320 to 1324) in Multan, Pakistan is a large octagonal brick-built mausoleum with polychrome glazed decoration that remains much closer to the styles of Iran and Afghanistan. Timber is also used internally. This was the earliest major monument of the Tughlaq dynasty (1320‚Äì1413), built during the unsustainable expansion of its massive territory. It was built for a Sufi saint rather than a sultan, and most of the many Tughlaq tombs are much less exuberant. The tomb of the founder of the dynasty, Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq (d. 1325) is more austere, but impressive; like a Hindu temple, it is topped with a small amalaka and a round finial like a kalasha. Unlike the buildings mentioned previously, it completely lacks carved texts, and sits in a compound with high walls and battlements. Both these tombs have external walls sloping slightly inwards, by 25¬∞ in the Delhi tomb, like many fortifications including the ruined Tughlaqabad Fort opposite the tomb, intended as the new capital.Blair & Bloom, 151-156; Harle, 425-426 The Tughlaqs had a corps of government architects and builders, and in this and other roles employed many Hindus. They left many buildings, and a standardized dynastic style.Blair & Bloom, 151 The third sultan, Firuz Shah (r. 1351-88) is said to have designed buildings himself, and was the longest ruler and greatest builder of the dynasty. His Firoz Shah Palace Complex (started 1354) at Hisar, Haryana is a ruin, but parts are in fair condition.Blair & Bloom, 154; Harle, 425 Some buildings from his reign take forms that had been rare or unknown in Islamic buildings.Blair & Bloom, 154-156 He was buried in the large Hauz Khas Complex in Delhi, with many other buildings from his period and the later Sultanate, including several small domed pavilions supported only by columns.Blair & Bloom, 154-156; Harle, 425 By this time Islamic architecture in India had adopted some features of earlier Indian architecture, such as the use of a high plinth,Blair & Bloom, 149 and often mouldings around its edges, as well as columns and brackets and hypostyle halls.Blair & Bloom, 156 After the death of Firoz the Tughlaqs declined, and the following Delhi dynasties were weak. Most of the monumental buildings constructed were tombs, although the impressive Lodi Gardens in Delhi (adorned with fountains, charbagh gardens, ponds, tombs and mosques) were constructed by the late Lodi dynasty. The architecture of other regional Muslim states was often more impressive.Harle, 426; Blair & Bloom, 156 File:Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra (literally \\"shed of 2¬Ω days\\").jpgScreen of the Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra mosque, Ajmer, c. 1229; Corbel arches, some cusped.

The sultanates of the Deccan Plateau, Gujarat, Bengal and Kashmir are discussed below. The architecture of the Malwa and Jaunpur sultanates has also left some significant buildings.Harle, 431-432 =Deccan sultanates= The Bahmani Sultanate in the Deccan broke away from the Tughlaqs in 1347, and ruled from Gulbarga, Karnataka and then Bidar until overrun by the Mughals in 1527. The main mosque (1367) in the large Gulbarga Fort or citadel is unusual in having no courtyard. There are a total of 75 domes, all small and shallow and small except for a large one above the mihrab and four lesser ones at the corners. The large interior has a central hypostyle space, and wide aisles with \\"transverse\\" arches springing from unusually low down (illustrated). This distinctive feature is found in other Bahmanid buildings, and probably reflects Iranian influence, which is seen in other features such as a four-iwan plan and glazed tiles, some actually imported from Iran, used elsewhere. The architect of the mosque is said to have been Persian.Blair & Bloom, 156; Harle, 433 Some later Bahminid royal tombs are double, with two units of the usual rectangle-with-dome form combined, one for the ruler and the other for his family,Harle, 433 as at the Haft Dombad (\\"Seven Domes\\") group of royal tombs outside Gulbarga. The Mahmud Gawan Madrasa (begun 1460s) is a large ruined madrasa \\"of wholly Iranian design\\" in Bidar founded by a chief minister, with parts decorated in glazed tiles imported by sea from Iran.Harle, 433 Outside the city the Ashtur tombs are a group of eight large domed royal tombs. These have domes which are slightly pulled in at the base,Harle, 433 predating the onion domes of Mughal architecture. The Qutb Shahi dynasty of Hyderabad, not absorbed by the mughals until 1687, greatly developed the city and its surrounding region, building many mosques such as the Mecca Masjid, Khairtabad Mosque, Hayat Bakshi Mosque and Toli Mosque, as well as the Golconda Fort, tombs of the Qutb Shahis, Charminar, Char Kaman and Taramati Baradari.

But stone was used for columns and prominent details, usually re-used from Hindu or Buddhist temples.Brown, XXIX; Hasan, 34-35; Harle, 428 The early 15th century Eklakhi Mausoleum at Pandua, Malda or Adina, is often taken to be the earliest surviving square single-domed Islamic building in Bengal, the standard form of smaller mosques and mausoleums. But there is a small mosque at Molla Simla, Hooghly district, that is possibly from 1375, earlier than the mausoleum.Hasan, 35-39 The Eklakhi Mausoleum is large and has several features that were to become common in the Bengal style, including a slightly curved cornice, large round decorative buttresses at the corners, and decoration in carved terracotta brick.Hasan, 36-37; Harle, 428 These features are also seen in the Choto Sona Mosque (around 1500), which is in stone, unusually for Bengal, but shares the style and mixes domes and a curving \\"paddy\\" roof based on village house roofs made of vegetable thatch. Such roofs feature even more strongly in later Bengal Hindu temple architecture, with types such as the do-chala, jor-bangla, and char- chala.Hasan, 23-25 For larger mosques, Bengali architects multiplied the numbers of domes, with a nine-domed formula (three rows of three) being one option, surviving in four examples, all 15th or 16th century and now in Bangladesh,Hasan, 41-44 although there were others with larger numbers of domes.Hasan, 44-49 Interior of the hypostyle hall of the Adina Mosque Buildings in the style are the Nine Dome Mosque and the Sixty Dome Mosque (completed 1459) and several other buildings in the Mosque City of Bagerhat, an abandoned city in Bangladesh now featured as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. These show other distinctive features, such as a multiplicity of doors and mihrabs; the Sixty Dome Mosque has 26 doors (11 at the front, 7 on each side, and one in the rear). These increased the light and ventilation. Further mosques include the Baro Shona Masjid; the Pathrail Mosque, the Bagha Mosque, the Darasbari Mosque, and the Kusumba Mosque. Single-domed mosques include the Singar Mosque, and the Shankarpasha Shahi Masjid. Both capitals of the Bengal Sultanate, first Pandua or Adina, then from 1450 Gauda or Gaur, started to be abandoned soon after the conquest of the sultanate by the Mughals in 1576, leaving many grand buildings, mostly religious. The materials from secular buildings were recycled by builders in later periods.Banglapedia While minarets are conspicuously absent in most mosques, the Firoz Minar was built in Gauda to commemorate Bengali military victories. The ruined Adina Mosque (1374‚Äì75) is very large, which is unusual in Bengal, with a barrel vaulted central hall flanked by hypostyle areas. It is said to be the largest mosque in the sub-continent, and modeled after the Ayvan-e Kasra of Ctesiphon, Iraq, as well as the Umayyad Mosque of Damascus. The heavy rainfall in Bengal necessitated large roofed spaces, and the nine-domed mosque, which allowed a large area to be covered, was more popular there than anywhere else.Hasan, 35-36, 39 After the Islamic consolidation of Bengal was complete, some local features continued, especially in smaller buildings, but the Mughals used their usual style in imperial commissions.Banglapedia File:Shat Gombuj Mosque 0016.JPGShat Gombuj (Sixty Dome) Mosque in Bagerhat, Bangladesh File:Sixty Dome Mosque (2).jpgInterior of the Shat Gambuj Mosque File:Darashbari Mosque PRG 8157.jpgRuined mihrabs and arabesque inside Darasbari Mosque, 15th- century File:Chapai KhaniaDighiMosque 03Jun16 MG 4937.jpgTerracotta arabesque on the wall of Khania Dighi Mosque, Gauda, 15th-century File:Faridpur PatrailMoshjid MG 2977.jpgMulti-domed Pathrail Mosque, 15th-century File:Eklakhi Mausoleum at Pandua in Malda district 01.jpgSingle-domed Eklakhi Mausoleum, early 15th-century File:Firoze Minar at Gaur in Malda district 08.jpgFiroz Minar, Gauda, 1480s File:Choto Sona Mosque from Bangladesh 03.jpgCorner tower with arabesque on Choto Sona Mosque, late 15th and early 16th centuries File:\\"DAKHIL DARWAZA, GOUR\\".jpgDakhil Doorway, Gauda, 16th- century = Gujarat Sultanate = Under the Gujarat Sultanate, independent between 1407 and 1543, Gujarat was a prosperous regional sultanate under the rule of the Muzaffarid dynasty, who built lavishly, particularly in the capital, Ahmedabad. The sultanate commissioned mosques such as the Jami Masjid of Ahmedabad, Jama Masjid at Champaner, Jami Masjid at Khambhat, Qutbuddin Mosque, Rani Rupamati Mosque, Sarkhej Roza, Sidi Bashir Mosque, Kevada Mosque, Sidi Sayyed Mosque, Nagina Mosque and Pattharwali Masjid, as well as structures such as Teen Darwaza, Bhadra Fort and the Dada Harir Stepwell in Ahmedabad. In the 15th century the Gujarat style is especially notable for its inventive and elegant use of minarets. They are often in pairs flanking the main entrance, mostly rather thin and with elaborate carving at least at the lower levels. Some designs push out balconies at intervals up the shaft; the most extreme version of this was in the lost upper parts of the so-called \\"shaking minarets\\" at the Jama Mosque, Ahmedabad,\\"The Shaking Minarets at Ahmedabad, drawn in 1809\\", British Library which fell down in an earthquake in 1819.

In the capital at Srinagar in modern Indian-administered Kashmir, Sikandar Shah Mir constructed the Jamia Masjid, a large wooden congregational mosque that incorporates elements of Buddhist pagoda structure, as well as the wooden Khanqah-e-Moulah mosque. Also in Srinagar are the Aali Masjid and the Tomb of Zain-ul-Abidin. Two 14th-century wooden mosques in Gilgit-Baltistan are the Chaqchan Mosque in Khaplu (1370) and the Amburiq Mosque in Shigar. Both have stone-built cores with elaborately carved wooden exterior galleries, at Amburiq on two levels, in an adaptation of traditional local styles.

Mughal architecture Humayun's Tomb, Delhi, the first fully developed Mughal imperial tomb, 1569-70 The Mughal Empire, an Islamic empire that lasted in India from 1526 to 1857 left a mark on Indian architecture that was a mix of Islamic, Persian, Turkish, Arabic, Central Asian and native Indian architecture. A major aspect of Mughal architecture is the symmetrical nature of buildings and courtyards. Akbar, who ruled in the 16th century, made major contributions to Mughal architecture. He systematically designed forts and towns in similar symmetrical styles that blended Indian styles with outside influences. The gate of a fort Akbar designed at Agra exhibits the Assyrian gryphon, Indian elephants, and birds. King's Gate at Fatehpur Sikri, near Agra During the Mughal era design elements of Islamic-Persian architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of the Hindustani art. Lahore, occasional residence of Mughal rulers, exhibits a multiplicity of important buildings from the empire, among them the Badshahi mosque (built 1673-1674), the fortress of Lahore (16th and 17th centuries) with the famous Alamgiri Gate, the colourful Wazir Khan Mosque,Simon Ross Valentine. 'Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice Hurst Publishers, 2008 p 63 (Lahore, 1634-1635) as well as numerous other mosques and mausoleums. The Shahjahan Mosque at Thatta, Sindh was built under, and probably largely by Shah Jahan, but strongly reflects Central Asian Islamic style, as the emperor had recently been campaigning near Samarkand. Singularly, the innumerable Chaukhandi tombs are of eastern influence. Although constructed between 16th and 18th centuries, they do not possess any similarity to Mughal architecture. The stonemason works show rather typical Sindhi workmanship, probably from before Islamic times. Later Mughal architecture, built under Aurangzeb (ruled 1658‚Äì1707), include the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore and Bibi ka Maqbara in Aurangabad. By the late 18th century the style was effectively over. However, by this time versions of Mughal style, often called \\"post-Mughal\\", had been widely adopted by the rulers of the princely states and other wealthy people of all religions for their palaces and, where appropriate, tombs. Hindu patrons often mixed aspects of Hindu temple architecture and traditional Hindu palace architecture with Mughal elements and, later, European ones.Harle, 443-444 Major examples of Mughal architecture include: * Tombs: Taj Mahal, Akbar's Tomb and Humayun's Tomb * Forts: Red Fort, Lahore Fort, Agra Fort and Idrakpur Fort * Mosques: Jama Masjid of Delhi, Badshahi Masjid and Moti Masjid *Gardens: Shalimar Gardens, Bagh-e-Babur and Verinag Garden *Caravansaries: Akbari Sarai and Bara Katra *Bridges: Shahi Bridge and Mughal Bridge *Milemarkers: Kos Minar File:Elephant-shaped column brackets at Lahore Fort.jpgThe use of elephant-shaped column brackets in buildings of the Lahore Fort reflects Hindu influences on Mughal Architecture during the reign of Akbar.

The most well known example of Mughal architecture is the Taj Mahal. It was built for the wife of Shah Jahan, who died in 1631. The main ideas and themes of garden tombs had already been explored by earlier Mughal emperors, and this was the culmination of all those previous works into a national landmark. The 171 meter white tomb rises above a reflecting pool. =Red Fort= The Red Fort in Delhi is also an important example of Mughal Architecture. It was built during the zenith of the Mughal Empire under Shah Jahan. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2007. As one of the largest forts in India, it served as the official residence of the emperor for nearly 200 years.  Post-Mughal Islamic architecture  Following the collapse of the Mughal Empire after the Mughal- Maratha Wars, the emergence of the Sikh Empire and the invasions of Nader Shah, Ahmad Shah Durrani and the British East India Company, prosperous provinces of the Mughal Empire such as Awadh, Bengal, Hyderabad and Mysore emerged as powerful regional states independent of Delhi. In Awadh (encompassing modern eastern Uttar Pradesh), Lucknow emerged as a centre of Ganga-Jamuni culture and Urdu/Hindustani literature. The Nawabs of Awadh sponsored the construction of architectural masterpieces such as Bara Imambara, Rumi Darwaza, Chota Imambara, Sikandar Bagh and Ghantaghar in Lucknow, as well as Gulab Bari and Bahu Begum ka Maqbara in Faizabad. In Hyderabad, the Asaf Jahi dynasty became exceedingly wealthy and were one of the richest royal families in the world by the mid-20th century. The Nizam commissioned construction of various public works and buildings in their state (often in Indo-Saracenic and Mughal style) such as the Telangana High Court, City College, Public Gardens, (formerly Bagh-e-Aaam), Jubilee Hall, Asafia Library, The Assembly building, Niloufer Hospital, the Osmania Arts College and Osmania Medical College, as well as palaces like Hyderabad House and Chowmahalla Palace. The so-called Indo-Saracenic architecture, beginning in the late 18th century, but mainly developing from the 1840s until independence a century later, was mostly designed by British or other European architects, and adopted Islamic or specifically Indian features, usually as a decorative skin on buildings whose essential forms reflected contemporary Western types and uses, whether as office buildings, palaces, courts of justice, railway stations or hotels. The style, which is very variable, thus became one of a number of revival architecture styles that were available to the Victorian architect. The usual type of Indian architecture borrowed from was Mughal architecture, or its Rajput palace version.

An alumnus of Tufts University, where he majored in English and philosophy, Cleaves lives in Austin, Texas. His full name is Richard Slaid Cleaves, but Slaid is the name that he has used his entire life. Cleaves is a full-time touring musician, but like most musicians has held many day jobs: janitor, warehouse rat, ice cream truck driver, rope-tow operator, film developer, groundskeeper, meter reader, and pizza delivery driver. He was even a human guinea pig. He was paid to be a subject in drug studies by a pharmaceutical company. Cleaves's musical roots extend back prior to his days playing in a high school \\"garage band\\" with his childhood friend Rod Picott. The two shared a love of music, especially Bruce Springsteen and named their band The Magic Rats, after a character in Springsteen's song \\"Jungleland.\\" He brought his love of American artists such as Woody Guthrie, Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Chuck Berry, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Tom Waits, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and more with him to Cork, Ireland, where he spent his junior year of college. To help pass the time he learned how to play the songs on guitar and on November 18, 1985 he made his debut as a busker‚Äîa street singer‚Äîin Cork City, Ireland. After several false starts he started to gain notice around Portland, Maine and in 1990 released his debut cassette, The Promise. Only a few songs off this album, \\"Sweet Summertime\\", \\"Lonesome Highway\\" and \\"Wrecking Ball\\" still occasionally get played in concert. The original tape has unfortunately been lost, and only copies remain. That was followed a year later by Looks Good from the Road, recorded with his rock band, The Moxie Men, which featured Cleaves on lead vocals and acoustic guitar, his brother J. on bass, Mark Cousins on drums and Pip Walter on electric guitar, acoustic guitar, and vocals. By the end of the year they were the darlings of the Portland press and touted as one of the bands \\"most likely to succeed.\\" However, Cleaves's solo acoustic side took over and in 1991 he moved with his wife, Karen, to Austin, Texas. In 1992, he was a winner of the prestigious New Folk competition at the Kerrville Folk Festival, an award previously given to such artists as Nanci Griffith, Robert Earl Keen and Steve Earle. Cleaves continued to work hard in Austin, playing various clubs around the city, touring, and continuing to hone his craft as a songwriter. In 1997, he recorded and released his first national album, No Angel Knows for the Rounder-Philo label, which has been his home ever since. In 2000, Cleaves had an Americana charts hit with his album Broke Down and song of the same name. The title track was co-written with his childhood friend Picott, whom he grew up with in Maine. Cleaves continued to gain notice with his follow-up album, 2004's Wishbones, appearing on the ESPN2 show Cold Pizza, and his music is praised by Nicholson Baker in his 2009 novel, The Anthologist. In 2006 Cleaves released Unsung, a collection of songs written by other singer-songwriters including Graham Weber, J. J. Baron, Michael O'Connor (who often tours with Cleaves), Adam Carroll, and Nicole St. Pierre. Dreamer: A Tribute to Kent Finlay, released in early 2016 on Austin-based Eight 30 Records, features Cleaves' version of \\"Lost,\\" his co-write with Finlay. Highway Prayer: A Tribute to Adam Carroll, released in late 2016 on Austin-based Eight 30 Records, features Cleaves' version of \\"South of Town.\\" Cleaves tours nationally performing solo and with a band in many configurations.

It is the second oldest town in Brooke County, Wellsburg being the oldest. Its population expanded steadily throughout the 1800s and into the 1900s because a section of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St. Louis (PCC&StL;) Railroad ran through the town, and because numerous coal mines were established, including the Blanch Coal Mine and the Locust Grove Mine. After both enterprises closed, the population declined until Colliers became a small, residential community. Throughout its existence, Colliers‚Äô social life has revolved primarily around the local schools and churches. Demographic Information Colliers has a population of 2,045 people. Of these, 2,008 of the people are Caucasian, eight are African American, eight are Asian/Pacific Islanders, fourteen are Hispanic, one is American Indian/Eskimo/Aleut, and nineteen are listed as other. 1,085 people are male, and 959 are female. History In 1771, Jacob Collier founded the settlement of Colliers. There was a small fort located in this settlement. The fort was used during battles with Native Americans during the late 1700s. The city of Colliers was officially founded in 1843. Many workers and their families immigrated from outside the United States. The coal mining industry was profitable, and numerous people immigrated to Colliers to work in the mines. These immigrants formed a community on the west end of Colliers called Logrow, or the Boardwalk. The PCC&StL; Railroad ran through this section of Colliers, which brought about the rise of a pool hall, a movie theater, and a mining company store, among other establishments. The east end of Colliers was known as Mine Hill. The train also stopped here, and as a result, Mine Hill saw the appearance of a restaurant, a boarding house, barbershops, and general stores. However, in the 1920s, the mines began running out of minerals and were shut down. Colliers‚Äô population decreased, especially in Logrow. The Great Depression hit the town hard, and many businesses closed. After the Depression, Colliers did not fully return to its former prosperity, as the mines could not reopen. The main source of income for the town became the Colliers Steel Corporation. After the corporation closed, the steel industry was revived by the 1998 opening of the Mountaineer Metal Products company. Schools In the mid-1800s, Elisha Stansbury, a man who owned 335 acres of land in Colliers and the surrounding area, realized that the town needed a school to educate the children, including his own eight. He donated a portion of his land on the west end of Colliers for a school. The school, known as the Number 2 School, was made up of one 60‚Äôx30‚Äô room. The typical school year lasted between four and six months to ensure that the children would be free to assist their parents during harvests, as well as to avoid the harsh conditions of winter. In the eastern section of Colliers, Elijah Robinson donated land for another school to be built. This school was known as the Number 13 School. It was built in 1879, when the average school year lasted around seven months. Both the Number 2 and Number 13 Schools lasted until 1907, when they were consolidated into a new school building located nearer to the center of town. This school was known as the First Colliers School. It had four classrooms, which was more than Colliers‚Äô previous schools. The First Colliers School lasted until 1921. During this time, African American children were not allowed to attend the same schools as white children. There were several immigrants and African Americans living in the Logrow community, and their children could not attend school. A spare room above the pool hall became a temporary classroom until a more suitable building could be acquired. In 1907, the students of the Number 2 School were transferred to the more modern First Colliers School. With the building empty, the African American students were free to use it for their own education. The school continued to educate the African American and immigrant population until the mid-1930s, when it closed. In 1939, the students who attended the Number 2 School were bussed to the new Ferry Glen School. This school did not remain open for long; it closed in 1946 due to a lack of attendance. Following the closure of the First Colliers School in 1921, the Second Colliers School opened. This school was a two-story red brick building. There were four classrooms on each floor, as well as restrooms, offices, an auditorium, and a cafeteria. In 1953, the school was remodeled to add two new classrooms, a restroom, and cafeteria equipment, and to improve the plumbing, heating, and electrical systems of the building. The building was further improved in the 1960s, adding fireproof doors at the top of the stairs, new desks, a gas boiler, and floor tiling in the classrooms. In 1985, the Second Colliers School was replaced by the Colliers Primary School, which closed after the 2017-2018 school year. This school was a one-story building constructed of brown brick. It had the capacity to hold 250 children, but in 1995, the enrollment was 165. Enrollment has marginally increased to 175 in 2013. Colliers Primary School was ranked 94th out of 420 primary schools in the state of West Virginia for the year 2017, with an overall grade of a B from Niche.https://k12.niche.com/rankings/public-elementary-schools/best- overall/s/west-virginia/ Colliers Primary School was named a 2017 National Blue Ribbon School with the designation as an Exemplary High Performing School. Colliers Primary was the first school in Brooke County to be nominated by the West Virginia Department of Education as a National Blue Ribbon School.https://nationalblueribbonschools.ed.gov/awardwinners/winning/17wv100pu_colliers_primary_school.html Also, the Colliers Primary School principal, JoEllen Connolly, was presented the national Terrel H. Bell Outstanding Leadership Award by the U.S. Department of Education. The award was a first for any West Virginia administrator.https://nationalblueribbonschools.ed.gov/education-secretary- devos-announces-recipients-of-the-2017-terrel-h-bell-awards-for-outstanding- school-leadership/#.Wfe7sGhSzIV Churches There are several churches in Colliers. The earliest church is the Colliers United Methodist Church, which was organized in 1834. In 1898, the Colliers Christian Church was founded as a non-denominational church. The First Nazarene Church of Colliers opened in 1958. The latest church to open is Open Door Baptist Church, which was first organized in 1982 and officially constituted in 1985. Mines = Blanch Mine = Blanch Mine was a coal mine owned by L.C. Smith, William Smith, and John McNulty. It was plagued by tragic accidents in the late 1800s. On November 21, 1892, three workers, one of them only fifteen years old, were killed and seven were wounded when twenty-five kegs of powder exploded inside the mine. Luckily, most of the workers had exited the mine to eat by the time the accident occurred. Two years later, on November 20, 1894, another explosion was caused in the mine by a new miner detonating an overcharged blast. The accident caused the deaths of seven workers and wounding eleven. = Locust Grove Mine = Locust Grove was owned by the West Virginia and Pittsburgh Coal Company. This mine was the location of another explosion. On June 11, 1914, shots were fired at the mine by unknown assailants, and a dynamite bomb was exploded at the mine entrance. It is likely that the attacks were the work of company employees taking part in a strike that had begun in September 1913, but the assailants were not caught. Sports Colliers held several bareknuckle boxing championship matches in the late 1800s. There were many reasons for choosing Colliers as the site for these exhibitions. Because of the railroad running through the town, transportation was readily available. Even those who could not ride the passenger train and had to rely on freight trains for transportation benefitted, as nearly all freight trains stopped at Colliers for coal and water. The profitability of the town was also a major factor. With its mining industry, Colliers provided its citizens with excess money that could be used for the customary collection that was taken for the loser of the fight, who would otherwise win no prize money. The most important reason for Colliers to be chosen was its proximity to state lines. As public boxing matches were prohibited in both West Virginia and Pennsylvania, a relatively small town near the state line had to be used. The participants in the fight were able to easily cross over into Pennsylvania if the authorities interfered, and could cross back if Pennsylvania authorities came. For this reason, many dog and chicken fights were also held in Colliers. On March 4, 1873, the bareknuckle boxing American lightweight championship match between Harry Hicken and Bryan Campbell took place at Colliers Station. After twenty-four rounds, both fighters fell and chaos descended on the crowd. The fighters‚Äô seconds, Ned O‚ÄôBaldwin and Owney Georghagen, began to fight, and O‚ÄôBaldwin was beaten with a pistol by a spectator. The fight was broken up, and the referee declared Hicken to be the winner. In 1880, the bareknuckle boxing world heavyweight championship match between Paddy Ryan and Joe Goss was held in Colliers. The match was prevented from occurring in Canada with extra border control and undercover detectives in America. Pennsylvania authorities also prohibited the match in Allegheny County, and Joe Goss assured the authorities that it would take place outside the county. The fight lasted for 87 rounds. Joe Goss, the reigning champion, was much more experienced than Ryan, who had never fought a championship match before. Ryan suffered many injuries to his head, and much of his body was bruised. However, due to Goss‚Äôs advancing age, he was unable to continue the fight, leaving Ryan the victor.

KCR is a program of Associated Students at San Diego State University. Operations and broadcasting In continuous operation since 1969, KCR's original broadcasts took place over cable systems. This was followed by Carrier Current AM on AM 550 in the Dorms on campus and in the campus area on the hard wired PA systems in the cafeterias and Aztec Center, as well as later analog FM band transmission, before it started broadcasting by way of 1610 AM in the college community area. It can currently be heard on local digital cable channels Cox 956 and TWC 957, and in the SDSU dorms on HD 81-61. It also streams to a KCR College Radio Android App, the TuneIn Radio app, and a Shoutcast player on its website. KCR can be heard playing in University Towers Kitchen and Cuicacalli Dining Hall on SDSU's campus, and Pizza Boss on College Square. History KCR Radio has long been considered one of the nation‚Äôs original college radio stations. Its free-form music format provided a launching pad for then undiscovered musical talents like the Police, the Clash, REM, Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails. KCR has recently changed from a free-form, music only format to a block schedule with music, talk, sports, and other programming. Philosophy and Format In the 1970s, KCR boasted, \\"If you hear it on commercial radio stations, you won't hear it here,\\" a testament to the fierce devotion of its DJs to independent, free-form radio. With DJs as diverse as the SDSU student population, the resulting broadcast variety of music and talk shows appeals to a wide cross- section of listeners with a loyal following locally, domestically, and even internationally on occasion. In 2013, KCR moved its programming away from free-form. KCR's current mission is to be the \\"Sound of State,\\" student designed programming for the SDSU community. Another part of KCR's mission is to provide opportunities for students to share their creativity, explore a career path, and gain broadcast and technical skills. All content is created by and broadcast by students (and some alumni). The station still has free- form shows, called Aztec Originals, where students are allowed to broadcast whatever content they want. Structured talk shows include The KCR Morning Show, #stateproblems, Talkin' Aztec Sports, and Talkin' National Sports. All songs played can be viewed on the KCR College Radio App for Android, the Tunein radio app for iPhone, and on the website. Live Remote Broadcasting KCR broadcasts live coverage of SDSU Ice Hockey and Baseball games that were an early 1970s popular addition. KCR talk show hosts have also covered student political events live from the field, such as a student moderated open-forum on the CSU \\"Student Success Fee,\\" and 2013 A.S. presidential candidate Gabriel Torres' open forum. Music DJs broadcast live from University Towers Kitchen on Friday nights. Secret Sessions In an effort to give SDSU students a chance to practice interviewing and production skills, KCR started a YouTube and Soundcloud series called \\"Secret Sessions\\" in Fall 2013. Secret Sessions premiered with an interview and acoustic performances by indie folk band Dresses, followed by a session with local San Diego band Uncle Jesse.
