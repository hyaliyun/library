It was founded by Dr. E John Reinhold in 1993, as a division of the American Evangelistic Association (AEA), with the goal of providing what it calls \\"biblical healthcare solutions\\" for Christians. The organization's main focus is their family healthcare program, Medi-Share, a medical bill sharing system based on principles from the Bible as outlined in Galatians 6:2. Medi-Share's affordable healthcare plan, that is exempt from the mandate to purchase health insurance under the Individual Mandate of the Affordable Care Act, has attracted many consumers. With a program membership population of 317,576 as of October 2017, Christian Care Ministry currently operates in all US states. Since 1993, members of the organization have shared and discounted medical expenses amounting to more than $2.1 billion. The common thread running through all of Christian Care Ministry's programs is the emphasis on a \\"healthy Biblical lifestyle\\". Christian Care Ministry is recognized by the American Heart Association as a Gold Level Fit-Friendly Company. Along with Samaritan Ministries and Christian Healthcare Ministries, Christian Care Ministry represents one of the three largest Christian healthcare sharing ministries in the U.S.  History  Christian Care Ministry began in 1993, when E. John Reinhold, a member of the AEA, decided to formalize the casual medical bill sharing process that existed among some of the association's membership. Working in his garage and home, Dr. Reinhold established guidelines for the sharing of members‚Äô medical bills. That same year, he moved his family to Melbourne, Florida, where Christian Care Ministry is still based today.  Healthcare Bill-Sharing Program  In order to participate in Christian Care Ministry's bill sharing program, members must be Christians who ascribe to the Statement of Faith and are active members of a church community. = Medi-Share = Medi-Share is the main focus of Christian Care Ministry, and has been the primary service of Christian Care Ministry since 1993. It is a Christian healthcare system of medical bill sharing. However, Medi-Share is not insurance, and not all medical conditions are eligible for sharing. Participants pay an AHP (Annual Household Portion) toward their own medical costs; expenses beyond this are eligible for sharing among the ministry's membership. As of 2017, Medi-Share has grown to over 300,000 members who share millions of dollars annually to pay one another's medical bills. The central theme of Christian Care Ministry is \\"connecting and equipping Christians to carry each other‚Äôs everyday burdens\\". The guiding principles of Medi-Share are biblical and based on teachings found in the New Testament, particularly those found in Galatians 6:2, which states: ‚ÄúCarry each other‚Äôs burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.‚Äù  Eligibility  Medi-Share allows members to help each other with medical bills, with the goal of providing a true example of Christian healthcare. However, Medi-Share is not insurance and does not guarantee that the medical costs of its members will be shared. Certain conditions are excluded, particularly those that arise from a lifestyle that does not meet the guidelines of the organization, such as drug or alcohol abuse, or extramarital sex. Many members find that Medi-Share helps them meet their family healthcare needs at a significantly lower cost than health insurance.  Legality  In 2002, Christian Care's Medi-Share bill-sharing program was challenged by some states‚Äô insurance regulators due to its status as a Christian healthcare organization. 43 states have inquired about the legality of the program, and in some cases legal action was taken. A series of court cases in Kentucky resulted from the specific way in which Medi-Share processed members‚Äô shares and disbursed payments. Changes have since been made to the Medi-Share system to bring it into line with state regulations and to maintain the organization's non-insurance status. As of June 25, 2013, the court ruled that Medi-Share was allowed to operate in Kentucky. Medi-Share operates legally in 50 states with state disclosures specific to Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Missouri, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Wisconsin.  Exemption from the Affordable Care Act Mandate  Medi-Share program membership numbers have seen an increase which may be related to the Individual Mandate of the Affordable Care Act, which initially required that all individuals in the U.S. have health insurance by 2014 or face tax penalties. This mandate has been since repealed federally, although it still stands in some states that have their own state healthcare exchange. Medi- Share members, like those of other healthcare sharing organizations, are exempt from the Individual Mandate and are not required to purchase health insurance. When healthcare reform was up for debate in 2010, public interest in faith based bill sharing programs like Medi-Share grew by 150 percent. Since the passage of the Affordable Care Act Medi-Share membership rates have risen. Prior to passage of the ACA, annual membership grew at a rate of 10 percent per year. Since the bill's passage, Medi-Share membership is up 15 percent per year.

He was the fourth son of George Watson of Saul's River, Jamaica and was educated at Lincoln's Inn from 1788 and St. Mary Hall, Oxford from 1791. Inheritance from Taylor family He married in 1810 Anna Susanna Taylor, daughter of Sir John Taylor, 1st Baronet of Lysson Hall, Jamaica, and thus gained considerable wealth from the Jamaican sugar cane plantations, specifically Jamaica, of John's brother Simon Taylor (sugar planter). He was granted the additional surname of Taylor by royal licence of 19 June 1815, following the death earlier that year of Sir Simon Richard Brissett Taylor, 2nd Baronet, whom his wife had succeeded. It was a practice among Jamaican planters to adopt the surname of their wives when they married into a wealthier family. When Sir Simon Taylor died, the main share of his estate, including the Jamaican plantations, passed to his eldest niece, Anna, and her husband George, making them as wealthy as practically anyone outside of the Royal Family and the aristocracy. From the proceeds of sugar and slavery, the couple bought a large landed estate in Wiltshire for ¬£200,000, and a house in London, and renovated it, the total cost coming to ¬£68,000. This wealth allowed them to socialise with King William IV of the United Kingdom, and to host the future Queen Victoria.Christer Petley, White Fury: A Jamaican Slaveholder and the Age of Revolution (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2018), p. 214.

On arrival in the House of Commons he was immediately elected to the standing committee of the Society of West India Planters and Merchants. He began his career as a member of the committee of West India planters and merchants, and opposed the abolition of slavery.Petley, White Fury, p. 214. When the slaves were emancipated in the 1830s, he received compensation to the tune of over ¬£20,000 for over 1,000 slaves in Jamaica.University College London, Legacies of British Slave- Ownership https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/person/view/-1221895888 Retrieved 1 September 2020. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1826. Death Despite inheriting great wealth from his wife's family, Watson was a spendthrift. He failed to live within his means, and by 1832 he was heavily in debt, and was compelled to auction off his personal property, having squandered much of the family fortune.Petley, White Fury, p. 214.

It was a specially built area accommodating over 15,000 spectators and park visitors, and was the first time a live site of this type had been created inside an Olympic Park. It was funded by British Airways and other commercial partners, and the National Lottery, and formed part of a programme of 70 live sites across the United Kingdom during the London 2012 Olympic Games. The Park Live area was the fifth largest venue on the London 2012 Olympic Park. During the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Park Live hosted approximately one million spectators. It also broadcast coverage of sporting events from inside Olympic Park venues and from other games venues around the UK.  Location  Park Live was located in the northern part of the Olympic Park, sited in a wetland bowl on banks of the River Lea. It straddled Sectors 5 and 6 of the Olympic Park and spanned two London Boroughs (the Park Live East Lawns were in the London Borough of Newham and the Park Live West Lawns were in the London Borough of Hackney) and was situated between the Velodrome, Basketball Arena, Copper Box and the Riverbank Arena.  Games coverage  At the heart of Park Live was a huge temporary structure built on stilts in the River Lea, consisting of two giant Panasonic screens broadcasting live coverage of the Olympic and Paralympic Games from 7am until midnight on every day of the games. This structure also included the British Airways Stage, where medal-winning athletes were interviewed live after competing, a VIP green room for athletes and guests, and live production facilities for 30 staff. The screens also broadcast daily games highlights, sport information films and sponsor messages. Approximately of reclaimed parklands were dedicated to the site. During the London 2012 games Park Live became known as the \\"Henman Hill\\" of the Olympic Park and was regularly featured in national and international news and television coverage, with broadcasters frequently cutting to Park Live for crowd reaction to sporting events, and reporters conducting vox pops and interviews with spectators. Each day of the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Park Live played host to numerous celebrities and medal-winning athletes including, Sir Chris Hoy, Jessica Ennis, Ben Ainslie, Rebecca Adlington, Dame Kelly Holmes, Denise Lewis OBE and Lord Sebastian Coe.  Awards  In March 2013 Park Live presented by British Airways was awarded the title of \\"Best Live Experience of 2012' at the BT Sport Industry Awards in London.  Future Plans  Plans are currently under discussion to create similar Park Live and live site experiences at future Olympic and Paralympic Games.

It was originally part of the central Seniorate Province, inherited by Duke Henry of Sandomierz (see Testament of Boles≈Çaw III Krzywousty). The Duchy was located in southeastern corner of the Kingdom of Poland, between the rivers of Pilica, Vistula, San, and Dunajec. Since late Middle Ages, it became part of historic province of Lesser Poland, together with adjacent Duchy of Krak√≥w. In the early 14th century, the Duchy was turned into Sandomierz Voivodeship. Its main urban centers were historic towns of Sandomierz and Wislica. Other main towns were Lublin, Radom, Chƒôciny, Pilzno, ≈Åuk√≥w and Stƒô≈ºyca. The period of fragmentation of Poland began in 1138, after the Testament of Boles≈Çaw III Krzywousty. According to the testament, Duke Henry of Sandomierz was granted the Land of Sandomierz. Since the duke was too young, the newly created province was temporarily ruled by High Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw II the Exile. In 1146, after another conflict with the junior dukes, Wladyslaw II was forced to flee abroad, and the Duchy of Sandomierz was transferred to Henry. Henry died in 1166, killed by the Old Prussians. Since he was childless and had no wife, part of his province, with Wislica, was inherited by his youngest brother, Casimir II the Just, while Sandomierz was seized by Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly. The province remained divided until 1173, when Casimir II the Just reunited it. Casimir II died in 1194, and the Duchy of Sandomierz was inherited by Leszek I the White, and his younger brother, Konrad I of Masovia. In ca. 1200 the brothers divided their properties, with Konrad receiving Mazovia and Kujawy, while Leszek remained in Sandomierz. In 1205, the two brothers united their forces, defeating Roman the Great in the Battle of Zawichost. In the 13th century, the Duchy of Sandomierz was several times raided by the Mongol hordes (see, e.g., Sack of Sandomierz (1241) and Sack of Sandomierz (1260)). In the late 1280s, Duke W≈Çadys≈Çaw I the Elbow-high took control over Sandomierz, but in 1292, he was forced by Wenceslaus II of Bohemia to abandon the province. In 1304, Lokietek returned, capturing Wislica, and after the death of Wenceslaus (1305), he seized whole province. During the reign of Lokietek, the Duchy of Sandomierz was turned into Sandomierz Voivodeship. The Duchy of Sandomierz had twelve castellanies, located in the following towns: ≈Åuk√≥w, Lublin, Sieciech√≥w, Radom, Skrzynno, ≈ªarn√≥w, Ma≈Çogoszcz, Czch√≥w, Wislica, Po≈Çaniec, Zawichost and Sandomierz.

Its causes may be either genetic or environmental. Long face syndrome is \\"a common dentofacial abnormality.\\" Its diagnosis, symptomology and treatments are complex and controversial. Indeed, even its existence as a \\"syndrome\\" is disputed. Definition and treatment One dental textbook defines it as: \\"Dolicofacial, there is excess of lower facial height usually associated with lower occlusal and mandibular plane angles.\\" This is often associated \\"with vertical maxillary excess and mandibular hypoplasia.\\" Luc P. M. Tourne, a Fellow in the Department of TMJ and Craniofacial Pain at the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry, noted: \\"There is a clinically recognizable facial morphology, the long face syndrome, which has been incompletely described in the literature,\\" However, her study of 31 adults with this syndrome, which included \\"analysis of esthetics, skeletal morphology, and occlusion\\" confirmed \\"this basic dentofacial deformity\\" has associations \\" with excessive vertical growth of the maxilla.\\" She reported that closed bite and dental open are two of the syndrome's variants.See The treatment for young patients troubled by long face syndrome is to halt and control descent of the lower jaw and to prevent the eruption of posterior teeth. In severe cases of deformity, a mixture of orthodontics and orthognathic surgery may be the only effective solution. The long-term (more than 6 years) effectiveness of surgical treatments for long face syndrome has been subject to study. \\"In the American literature, the terms long-face syndrome and short-face syndrome are often used.\\" To be sure, there are reported \\"long and the short face anomalies\\" and open bite cases. However, in the opinion of Hugo Obwegeser, there is no medical justification for naming them as a \\"syndrome\\" the signs and symptoms do not meet the definitional threshold. There is controversy concerning the use of the descriptor \\"long-face syndrome.\\" While increased anterior \\"total and lower face height\\" in many ages, combined with vertical maxillary excess in adults has been observed, the causes are controversial. Specifically, there is disagreement about possible potential environmental influences on genetic components. Anecdotally, it was said to be a genetic condition, which could only be corrected with \\"massive amounts\\" of debilitating, frequent and long dental and facial reconstructive surgery. For children, there is a concern that mouth breathing can contribute to the development of long face syndrome. A recent study finds that it is a growing problem which should be treated as \\"it won't just go away.\\" In addition to mouth breathing, it may be associated with sleep apnea. Because of long face syndrome's sometime association with pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and allergic reactions, it is essential that treating physicians differentiate the conditions and the treatments; treating one may not cure the other. Multilevel coblation surgery is sometimes used to correct moderate to severe OSA, and long face syndrome can be a rare factor in considering surgery. Notable people Actor and screenwriter Craig Chester says he has suffered from the condition.

Red Seraya in Libya The term saray is Turkish, and comes from the Persian word (sarƒÅy) meaning \\"palace\\". However, in English it corresponds to the Arabic term, with its particular historic meaning, and it does not correspond to \\"saray\\" in Persian; in such cases the corresponding English term is simply \\"palace\\". The same logic would generally be applied to Punjabi, for example Akbari Sarai in Lahore, Punjab, would be more obviously described as a palace than as a saray. A seraya should not be confused with a seraglio, though the origin of the words is probably the same.  Examples  Ottoman officers in front of the Al-Karak Saray in 1910, following the Karak Revolt. The most famous seray is the Grand Serail (, ) in Lebanon, which is the headquarters of the Prime Minister. It is situated atop a hill in downtown Beirut a few blocks away from the Lebanese Parliament. The hill was the site of an Ottoman army base from the 1840s, which was built up, fortified, and expanded in the 1850s. At first it was known as al quishla, from the Turkish word kƒ±≈üla, meaning barracks. Another example is the Red Seraya in Libya. It is in central Tripoli and houses a museum. The Seray of Aleppo is not from the time of Ottoman rule, it is a French construction. The new presidential palace of Turkey, completed in 2014, is popularly called Ak Saray (\\"White Palace\\"). Seray in Aleppo  Military units  Saraya is also used as a military unit title in the Arab world. In this case the Arabic is ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿäÿ©, a different word from \\"saraya\\" as in a building. The etymology is also different from the building: The etymology of ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿäÿ© is from Arabic and communicates the idea of a \\"private group\\". However the plural is ÿ≥ÿ±ÿßŸäÿß (saraya) indistinguishable from the term \\"saraya\\" which is a variant (in the singular) of saray (the building). The normal translation for ÿ≥ÿ±Ÿäÿ© is \\"company\\" (see: Company (military unit)) but in the case of the \\"Lebanese Resistance Saraya\\", the term is often arbitrarily translated as \\"brigades\\". Another example is the Syrian \\"Defense Saraya\\". In literature In an epic poem titled \\"Slaughter us all and make our blood a river. Cyprus poetry and history\\" the events are taking place at the Sarayi in Nicosia, Cyprus in July 1821.

It was known as the \\"Last fight for Charleston\\". Background Since the fall of Morris Island in 1863 no major offensive had been carried out against Charleston. Several small skirmishes and expeditions were carried out against James Island and Johns Island. On February 10, 1865 Union troops from the Northern District of the Department of the South under Brigadier General Alexander Schimmelfennig made one final expedition to James Island. Confederate Major Edward Manigault of the South Carolina Siege Train (Manigault's Battalion) commanded a small force manning rifle pits on the southern edge of James Island at Grimball's Causeway. Battle Early on the morning of February 10, four Union gunboats shelled the Confederate rifle pits while General Schimmelfennig's troops began their landing. The 144th New York Infantry led the main attack against the center of the Confederate line along the causeway. At the same time the 54th New York Infantry made a charge against the right flank of the Confederate line. Manigault detached a small force from the 2nd South Carolina Artillery along the causeway to reinforce the right. The attack of the 144th New York began to falter but the flank attack succeeded and the Confederates began to give way. Major Manigault was severely wounded and taken prisoner during the fighting. The official records reported that his leg required amputation and he died as a result, although in fact the major survived.Lewis, Catherine, Horry County, South Carolina 1730-1993 (1998) p. 172 The Union forces occupied the Confederate rifle pits following the skirmish. Aftermath The battle proved to be inconclusive when both sides eventually withdrew after making no significant gains. As Union General William T. Sherman‚Äôs army moved through South Carolina, the Confederate forces evacuated Charleston. Then on February 18, Schimmelfennig accepted the city's surrender from the mayor.Coffee p. 369 Forces UnionRipley, p. 244 1st Separate Brigade: Brigadier General Alexander Schimmelfennig *54th New York Infantry: Colonel Eugene Kolzay *144th New York Infantry: Colonel James Lewis *32nd U.S. Colored Infantry: Colonel George W.

Early life He was the second son of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, by his wife, Lady Magdalene Carnegie, daughter of David Carnegie, 1st Earl of Southesk. His paternal grandparents were John Graham, 4th Earl of Montrose and Lady Margaret Ruthve (daughter of William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie). Shortly after the death of his elder brother at the Bog of Gight in 1645, he was seized by General John Urry at Montrose, Angus where, aged about 14 years, he was attending school with a tutor. They were for a time imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle. Montrose estate On the execution of the 1st Marquess of Montrose for high treason on 20 May 1650, the Montrose estates were forfeited. After the defeat of Charles II in 1652, Montrose made an appearance in London, was received by Oliver Cromwell, and quickly departed for Scotland, where his estates were restored to him. In the following year he took part in the rising in the Highlands under William Cunningham, 9th Earl of Glencairn. In March 1653-4 he quarreled there to the point of violence with his hereditary enemy Lord Lorne (the courtesy title of the future 9th Earl of Argyll). When matters in the Highlands began to look desperate, he and Glencairn sent to George Monck that they might surrender, on terms of life. Shortly afterwards Montrose with a force of two hundred men was completely routed by a smaller force under Cornet Peas. He and his party then made separate peace terms with Monck, agreeing on the 23rd to come to Dundee and give up their arms, and arrange securities. After the Restoration, Montrose took part in the state funeral of his father at Holyrood Abbey on 1 January 1661. He declined to vote at the trial of Archibald Campbell, 1st Marquess of Argyll in the following April, saying he could not be impartial. Montrose made a monetary claim against his son, Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll, as a recompense for lands which had been given to the Marquess of Montrose on his father's forfeitures. The matter led to litigation between them, but a negotiated arrangement was reached, and on 23 February 1667 they drank each other's health in the presence of the lord commissioners. Montrose was appointed an extraordinary lord of session, 25 June 1668.

He was Lord High Admiral of Scotland from 1705 to 1706. He was Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland from 1709 to 1713 and served as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland from 1716 to 1733.

I think that nothing more interesting can ever happen to me.\\" Marek Nied≈∫wiecki, Radiota czyli skƒÖd siƒô biorƒÖ Nied≈∫wiedzie (Wielka Litera, Warszawa 2014, ), p.56 Created in 1982, Lista Przeboj√≥w Programu Trzeciego got immediate popularity. The first edition was broadcast on 24 April, but a week before Marek Nied≈∫wiecki presented a set of songs for the listeners to choose from. The first number one was \\"I‚Äôll find my way home\\" by Jon & Vangelis.Wies≈Çaw Weiss, 33 x Tr√≥jka (Vesper, Pozna≈Ñ 2012, ), p.33 Throughout the years the time and day of The Charts broadcast changed, it was Saturday or Friday ‚Äì each twice, between 20.00 and 22.00, 18.00 ‚Äì 22.00 and 19.00 ‚Äì 22.00. Now it is emitted every Friday, from 19.00 till 22.00. Originally, Marek Nied≈∫wiecki was the only host of The Charts. In the times of his illness or holiday he was replaced by a number of people, hosting from one to thirty one programmes and including such popular names as Wojciech Mann, Piotr Kaczkowski, Piotr Metz, Piotr Stelmach, Grzegorz Miecugow or Kuba Strzyczkowski.Jacek Marcinkowski, Jakub Jarosz, ABC Druh√≥w Zastƒôpowych i Kazi√≥w (Agencja Wydawniczo-Artystyczna jotem.3.pl, ≈öwieszyno, 2011, ), p.339 https://www.facebook.com/ABC- druh%C3%B3w-zast%C4%99powych-i-kazi%C3%B3w-205920509446995/ When Marek Nied≈∫wiecki left for Radio Z≈Çote Przeboje, Piotr Baron became the host. After his coming back, he and Piotr Baron host The Charts in turns, and the one not hosting The Charts in the given week, hosts the morning programme LP3 in which songs from The Charts (both current and archival) are presented.Wies≈Çaw Weiss, 33 x Tr√≥jka (Vesper, Pozna≈Ñ 2012, ), p.34 First the votes were sent on postcards or dictated on the phone by the listeners, since April 1996 voting has been done by the Internet. The number of votes per person changed from two in the beginning to ten nowadays. The Charts used to include 20 songs, then 30, 40, now it is 50 divided into two parts: the so-called \\"waiting room\\" (only a small part of each song is presented) and the basic list (the songs going up are presented in full). The Charts used to have many interludes such as short reports from the Netherlands, the USA, France, \\"letters from fans\\" (which at the beginning weren‚Äôt actual letters at all, they were all made up, but people took to this idea immediately and started writing real letters to Maria Teodorowicz, who presented those Wies≈Çaw Weiss, 33 x Tr√≥jka (Vesper, Pozna≈Ñ 2012, ), p. 46 ), news from the music world, chats with Polish music stars and a huge collection of jingles introducing different parts of the programme.\\"Jingle z Listy Przeboj√≥w\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_m2ff0DZWpQ The most recognisable, and still used, is the song \\"The look of love\\" by ABC and the voice of a little boy named Czarek who says \\"goodbye\\" in a very cute way ‚Äì both usually played at the end of the programme. Marek Nied≈∫wiecki also uses mails from the listeners during the programme, organises quizzes, sometimes invites guests (usually musicians) and before the 10th position on The Charts there are a few minutes for Helen (Halina Wachowicz), who gives the results of the quizzes or just chats with the host. From time to time, The Charts takes place outside the studio. \\"The Charts on location\\" is especially popular among fans because it gives them the possibility to watch Marek Nied≈∫wiecki at work, but Marek Nied≈∫wiecki himself considers it a really bad idea: \\"In my opinion, we, in Radio Three, didn‚Äôt manage to find a suitable solution, so that it would be interesting for the people who come to the events outside the studio, and, at the same time, for the listeners, who are much bigger in number. Usually, it turns out to be a neverending collection of listeners‚Äô greetings for aunts or uncles ‚Äì which is extremely important for some thirty people shaking with emotion, but for the people next to the radio sets ‚Äì they feel like puking.\\" Marek Nied≈∫wiecki, Radiota czyli skƒÖd siƒô biorƒÖ Nied≈∫wiedzie (Wielka Litera, Warszawa 2014, ), p.197-198 Nevertheless, starting from 25 August 1995 in Gda≈Ñsk, The Charts has visited many cities and towns all over Poland, the most popular being Szklarska Porƒôba, the winter capital of Polish Radio Three.

In 2008 he created his own Australia Top Ten, which included: Uluru, Kata Tjuta, Tasmania, The Pinnacles Desert, Fraser Island, Twelve Apostles Marine National Park on Great Ocean Road, Sydney, Melbourne, Blue Mountains, Lucky Bay, Great Ocean Drive and Wave Rock.Marek's blog http://www.marekniedzwiecki.pl/e9e37b244678a65d5ebf4f68875572f1,entry.html A few years later the list changed only in one position: Wave Rock was replaced by Kimberley,Marek Nied≈∫wiecki, Nie wierzƒô w ≈ºycie pozaradiowe (Agora, Warszawa 2011, ), pp 120-121 which now Marek Nied≈∫wiecki mentions just after Uluru. His first journey to Australia took place in January 1995. He was invited by four local Polish radio stations (in Adelaide, Perth, Sydney, Melbourne) for four weeks and he was supposed to be a DJ there, which turned out to be rather meetings with the Poles living there. Marek Nied≈∫wiecki made many friends and came back Down Under twelve times so far, as a turist. He usually spends there four to six weeks, since he claims it's not worth coming for a shorter period of time because of the distance between Poland and Australia and the discomforts of travelling.Marek Nied≈∫wiecki, Australijczyk, (Wielka Litera, Warszawa 2015, ), p.11 From every journey Marek Nied≈∫wiecki brings many photos which he publishes on his blog http://www.marekniedzwiecki.pl/ . Since 11 March 2009 a collection of his photographs has been travelling through Poland. Organized by Muzeum Ziemi Lubuskiej, the exhibition consists of 50 photos, chosen by the museum staff from the 200 suggested by the author.Marek's blog http://www.marekniedzwiecki.pl/4b7e59cfb135ded984e464e39a7ebc5d,entry.html The exhibition was presented in numerous Polish cities such as Zielona G√≥ra, Bydgoszcz, Kutno, Turek, Rybnik, Radomsko, Koszalin, Nekla or Inowroc≈Çaw.http://www.ziemialubuska.pl/2598,2485,,.html = Szklarska Porƒôba = Marek Nied≈∫wiecki says that he has left part of his heart in Jizera Mountains.Marek Nied≈∫wiecki, Nie wierzƒô w ≈ºycie pozaradiowe (Agora, Warszawa 2011, ), p.151 He usually stays in Szklarska Porƒôba: \\"I fell in love with her around the same time I fell in love with Australia [...]. It was the second half of the 90s. I started going there on business. Szklarska became the summer and winter capital of Polish Radio Three. And then I was lost. Like it happens in love. [‚Ä¶] I have my favourite places, walks, routes‚Ä¶ I can do it many times and it is never boring. [‚Ä¶] My house will be there, because it is already my place.\\" Marek's blog http://www.marekniedzwiecki.pl/c42b7e31c91ffe9ce75b93fdb9309e01,entry.html Walking in Karkonosze Mountains and Jizera Mountains Marek Nied≈∫wiecki also takes a lot of photos which he then shows on his blog. In February 2015 in Szklarska Porƒôba he opened his exhibition of mountain photos called \\"Dream Mountains\\".http://www.polskieradio.pl/9/29/Artykul/1374506,Trojka-gorom-w- Szklarskiej-Porebie On 7 January 2013 he was awarded the statuette of R√ºbezahl (Polish: Liczyrzepa, Karkonosz) who is a folklore mountain spirit of Karkonosze Mountains. \\"How is this possible? It's the prize for love, the joy of being there and the pleasure of talking and writing about Szklarska Porƒôba, Jakuszyce, The Jizera Mountains.

She also initiated a drive to invite over 400 new members, many of whom were young and came from diverse backgrounds. Boone Isaacs has been an active force in addressing the lack of diversity, and an imbalance of membership that is predominantly white and male. Other efforts that she is addressing is focusing on improving AMPAS mentorship programs, enhancing the student version of the Academy Awards and improving the scientific and technical council. Part of her duties as President were to oversee the Academy Awards. Boone Isaacs also oversaw the Governors Awards, where honorary lifetime achievement awards are given. Unlike the Oscars, the Governors Awards are not televised ceremonies. She has also spearheaded the development of an AMPAS museum developed in conjunction with Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art that has a budget of $300 million, and opened in 2017. At the 2015 Governors Awards, Boone Isaacs launched a new Academy initiative called A2020, which focuses on improving representation of diversity‚Äîage, gender, race, national origin, point-of-view‚Äîand includes a five-year plan to focus on industry practices and hiring.

Wharton graduated from the University of Kentucky in 1935 with a bachelor's degree in botany and geology. She then engaged in graduate work, receiving a master's degree (1936) and a doctorate from the University of Michigan, the latter in 1946. In 1942, she collected a dewberry from Montgomery County, Kentucky which proved to be a new species; it was named Rubus whartoniae in her honor. After her doctoral work, she took a teaching position at Georgetown College where she spent 30 years. She collected plant species for the University of Kentucky Herbarium. Besides being an avid plant collector, Wharton was also a writer. Wharton collaborated with Roger Barbour on two field guides, Wildflowers and Ferns of Kentucky (1971) and Shrubs of Kentucky (1973), and a natural history of the Inner Blueglass Region, Bluegrass Land and Life. In addition, Wharton edited diaries and letters of Martha McDowell Buford Jones, a Confederate wife, published in 1986 as Horse World of the Bluegrass and Peach Leather and Rebel Grey. Beginning in the late 1950s, Wharton bought parcels of land on the Kentucky River and founded the Floracliff Nature Sanctuary in 1989; it was dedicated as a Kentucky State Nature Preserve on March 15, 1996. Wharton was involved in environmental activism throughout her later years until her death in 1991, in particular issues such as the proposed damming of the Red River Gorge and the expansion of the Paris Pike.

Godbold (December 2, 1879 - November 21, 1952) was the fourth president of Southern Baptist-affiliated Louisiana College in Pineville, Louisiana, a position which he held from 1942 until his retirement in 1951. Background A native of Auburn in Lincoln County in southwestern Mississippi, Godbold was the oldest of six children of Thomas Rowan \\"Tom\\" Godbold (1846-1926) and the former Mary S. \\"Mollie\\" Terry (1857-1933). The parents are interred in Amite County, Mississippi. Godbold graduated from Auburn High School and in 1905 and 1910, respectively, received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Baptist-affiliated Mississippi College in Clinton. He was from 1905 to 1906 a principal in Lawrence County in southwestern Mississippi. From 1906 to 1907, he attended the University of Chicago, from which he received his doctorate. He was called to overseas duty in World War I from 1918 to 1919. Baptist career From 1906 to 1912, he was a biology professor at Mississippi College; then, he taught in his field at Louisiana College from 1913 to 1918. From 1912 to 1918, he was the executive secretary of the Louisiana Baptist Education Commission. From 1919 to 1923, Godbold was the corresponding secretary of the executive board of the Louisiana Baptist Convention, based in Alexandria. Decades later near the end of his life, he was from 1950 to 1951 the president of the Louisiana Baptist Convention. From 1923 to 1929, Godbold was president of Baptist-affiliated Howard Payne College in Brownwood, Texas. After Howard Payne, Godbold was from 1929 to 1942 the executive secretary and then superintendent of the Missouri Baptist Convention, based in the state capital in Jefferson City, Missouri. During this time he was elected in 1930 as the vice president of the Southern Baptist Education Association. Godbold returned to Louisiana College as president in 1942, having succeeded the interim president and college dean, Hal Monroe Weathersby (1885‚Äì1965). Godbold worked to raise funds for capital development, much of which came during the 1950s after he had left the college presidency. He raised $42,000 in forty days to build the three-story men's residence dormitory, Godbold Hall. In 1951, Godbold announced that he would retire as LC president and was succeeded in the summer of that year by G. Earl Guinn. According to Oscar Hoffmeyer's Louisiana College, 75 Years: A Pictorial History, the institution had approached Billy Graham about taking the LC presidency, but Graham declined to be considered in order to continue with his evangelistic ministry. Graham had been introduced to Louisiana Baptists by Leonard F. Sanderson, Sr. (1914-2005), the director of evangelism for the Tennessee Baptist Convention, who later was employed for many years by the Louisiana Baptist Convention. Death and legacy In 1909, then residing in Clinton, Mississippi, Godbold married the former Margaret Irene Coleman (1886-1938) in Robinsonville, now known as Tunica Resorts, in northwestern Mississippi. She died in 1938 in Kansas City, Missouri, and is interred in her native Mississippi, specific location not know, possibly Amite County or Robinsonville. In 1940, at the age of sixty-one while still living in Missouri, Godbold remarried. His second wife, Lucie T. Yates Godbold (1893-1973), was a Mississippi native, who died at the age of eighty in a nursing home in Natchitoches, Louisiana. After Edgar's death, Lucie married a man named Roberts, who predeceased her. After he left LC, Godbold remained president emeritus with fund-raising duties until his death in 1952. Edgar and Lucie Godbold are interred side by side at Forest Lawn Memorial Park near Pineville in Ball, Louisiana. The Godbold-Ware Plaza, named for Edgar Godbold and Edwin O. Ware, Sr., the first president of Louisiana College, was dedicated on March 15, 2011 by current LC president Joe W. Aguillard. Remarks can be observed here.

Life He was the son of Thomas Hog, minister of Larbert, Stirlingshire (d. 1680?). After graduating with an MA from the University of Edinburgh in 1677. He studied theology in Holland, was licensed to preach by the presbytery of Edinburgh, and ordained minister of Dalserf parish, in the presbytery of Hamilton, 20 January 1691. Hog declined on principle to take the oath of allegiance in 1693. Against his own desire he was in 1695 elected a member of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, but declined to take the required oaths. The Lord High Commissioner then objected to his taking his seat, and Hog under pressure retired from the Assembly. In bad health Hog resigned his charge on 12 November 1696, but in August 1699 he was installed in the parish of Carnock, Fife, and held the post till his death, on 14 May 1734. The Marrow Men Hog belonged to the stricter section of the Church of Scotland, who cherished the Covenanter traditions, upheld popular rights, and took their stand against the more tolerant methods of thought and discipline that had come into the church. He originated the \\"Marrow\\" controversy by the republication in 1718, with a preface, of the Marrow of Modern Divinity. The book was denounced by an act of the assembly in 1720, whereupon Hog and 11 other ministers, who became known as the \\"Marrow Men\\", presented a protest. The bitter controversy which followed was an indirect cause of the First Secession of 1733. He was eulogised by Ralph Erskine. Works Besides prefaces to other religious treatises, Hog was the author of a large number of theological pamphlets, listed in Hew Scott's Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae. They include: *A Casuistical Essay on the Lord's Prayer, 1705; *Notes on the Covenant of Works and Grace, 1706; *The Covenants of Grace and Redemption displayed, 1707; *Otia Christiana, 1708; *Letters on the lawfulness of imposing Forms of Prayer, 1710; *Letters to a Gentleman detecting the Gangrene of some Errors vented at this time, 1714; *Vindication of the Doctrines of Grace from a charge of Antinomianism, 1718; *Some missives written to a Gentleman detecting and refuting the Deism of our Time, 1718; *Explication of Passages excepted against the Marrow, 1719; *On Covenanting, 1727; and *On Professor Campbell's Divinity, 1731.

Born into a wealthy Anglo-Jewish family, he rejected both his religious and social upbringing to protest for women's suffrage. Joining in with the militant suffragettes, he was sent to prison multiple times, making him one of the few men to be imprisoned for his part in the suffrage movement. His crimes included an attempted attack on Winston Churchill and an act of arson on a train. He was the first person to be released under the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913 (the so-called \\"Cat and Mouse law\\"), and he later married the second, Elsie Duval. Following his release, he never returned to prison, but still campaigned for women's rights and penal reform. He stood unsuccessfully for parliament on two occasions, but did win a seat on Middlesex County Council and was a member of the Labour Party executive committee. Early life Hugh Franklin was born to Arthur Ellis Franklin and Caroline Franklin (n√©e Jacob), the fourth of six children. The Franklin family was a prominent member of the Anglo-Jewish \\"cousinhood\\", and the family was well-off and well-connected. Hugh's uncles included the Liberal politicians Sir Leonard Franklin, Sir Stuart Samuel and Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel.Bernard Wasserstein, ‚ÄòSamuel, Herbert Louis, first Viscount Samuel (1870‚Äì1963)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2011 accessed 2 Aug 2013 Hugh was educated at Clifton College\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p248: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 and, on graduation in 1908, he moved to Caius College, Cambridge to read engineering. However, on finishing his first year of study, Hugh made several moves that would ultimately lead to his estrangement from his father. Firstly, he wrote his father a letter, declaring his agnosticism and rejecting the Jewish faith. Secondly, he attended a speech by Emmeline Pankhurst and her daughter Christabel on the topic of women's suffrage. Finally, he abandoned his studies in engineering and began to read economics and sociology instead. He became an active member of the Women's Social and Political Union, the Young Purple White and Green Club and the Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement. Hugh left Cambridge for a while to promote the WSPU in London ‚Äì on his return, he did not put his heart into his studies and missed his examinations. By June 1910, he had abandoned university altogether. Although his religious views had led his father to disown him, the family ties were still strong enough that Herbert Samuel, at that point Postmaster General, decided to offer Hugh a position as a private secretary to Matthew Nathan, Secretary of the General Post Office. Hugh took the position reluctantly. It was not to last long, however. Activism An anti-\\"Cat and Mouse Act\\" poster from the WSPU. Hugh Franklin was the first person freed under the act. Hugh was one of the people present at the rally on Parliament on 18 November 1910 ‚Äì the rally that was later to be known as Black Friday. When the Conciliation Bill, which would have granted limited suffrage to female property owners, failed to pass, around 300 suffragettes descended on the Palace of Westminster. The protesters were driven back by police, and many reported being victims of police brutality. Winston Churchill was at that point Home Secretary, and he was widely blamed for the police excesses on display. Hugh Franklin, who was angered by what he had seen, began to follow Churchill to heckle him at public meetings. On the train back from a meeting in Bradford, Yorkshire,http://www.churchillarchive.com/explore/catalogue?id=CHAR%202%2F46 Hugh met Churchill and set on him with a dog whip, shouting \\"Take this, you cur, for the treatment of the suffragists!\\" The attack was widely reported, even reaching the headlines of The Times, and for the Franklin family, it was a great embarrassment. Hugh was imprisoned for six weeks and dismissed as Sir Nathan's secretary. In March 1911, he was sentenced for another month for throwing rocks at Churchill's house. Hugh took part in the hunger strikes that were then being waged by the suffragettes, and was force fed repeatedly during his imprisonment. The force feeding turned him into an activist for penal reform ‚Äì not long after he was released, he began petitioning his uncle to investigate the case of William Ball, a prisoner supposedly driven insane by force feeding. Hugh's final militant act was setting fire to a railway carriage at Harrow on 25 October 1912. He then went on the run, spending two months at the famous radical book store Henderson's, better known as \\"The Bomb Shop\\", before being caught and sentenced to six months in prison in February 1913. He was force fed 114 times, and the ordeal left him so weak that he was released as soon as the Prisoners (Temporary Discharge for Ill Health) Act 1913 came into force, making him the first person to be let out under the act. With his licence expiring in May, he fled the country and stayed in Brussels under the assumed name of Henry Forster until the outbreak of World War I. Due to poor eyesight, he was not called to serve in the trenches. He took a job in a munitions factory and after the war he ceased his militant activities, although he kept close ties with the suffragettes, including Sylvia Pankhurst. Later life Hugh joined the Labour Party in 1931 and attempted to become an MP, standing in Hornsey in 1931 and St Albans in 1935. Despite his lack of success here, he was prolific in local politics, and eventually won a seat on Middlesex County Council, and he was ultimately able to join the Labour Party National Executive Committee. He died on 21 Oct 1962. Family and relationships Souvenir paper napkin celebrating the marriage between Hugh Franklin and Elsie Duval, Sep. 1915.Elsie Duval, Hugh's first wife Hugh was the fourth of six siblings and had three brothers and two sisters; in order, Jacob, Alice, Cecil, Helen and Ellis. Hugh was not the only politically active one ‚Äì Alice, a staunch socialist, would later become a leader of the Townswomen's Guild; Helen became forewoman at the Royal Arsenal, where she was forced to resign for supporting female workers and attempting to form a trade union, and Ellis became vice-principal of the Working Men's College. Through Ellis, Hugh was also the uncle of the famous crystallographer Rosalind Franklin. In 1915, Hugh married fellow suffragist Elsie Diederichs Duval (1893‚Äì1919), who he had been engaged to since their \\"Cat and Mouse\\" days in 1913 ‚Äì Elsie was the second person to be released under the law, after Hugh. Elsie converted to Judaism, and the couple married in the synagogue. Her mother Jane Emily n√©e Hayes (c1861‚Äì1924) was an active suffragette, as Emily Hayes Duval she was imprisoned for six weeks in 1908 following a demonstration at H. H. Asquith's house. Hugh stayed with Elsie until, probably weakened by her own force feeding, she died in 1919 from Spanish flu. Hugh later married another non-Jewish Elsie in 1921, Elsie Constance Tuke. Tuke never converted to Judaism. This was the final straw for Arthur, who disinherited him.

Origins  Two possible origins have been suggested for the name. One possible source is a derivation from an Old English personal name \\"Drabbe\\", from before the 7th-century. This is recorded as a name of a Peterborough festerman, in 963 - 992, in A. J. Robertson's Anglo Saxon Charters. Modern surnames may be a diminutive of this, but the etymology is uncertain. The name is also likely to have its origins in a modern English word \\"drab\\". Although not recorded before the 16th century, this is associated with the Irish Gaelic \\"drabog\\", meaning slattern; this would have been given as a nickname, perhaps to the child of an untidy person.

He is the son of noted pianist Vladimir Yampolsky. According to his biography, Yampolsky \\"studied violin with the legendary David Oistrakh at the Moscow Conservatory (1961‚Äì1966) and conducting with Maestro Nikolai Rabinovich at the Leningrad Conservatory (1968‚Äì1973). He was a member of the Moscow Philharmonic as both violinist and assistant conductor, under the direction of renowned Maestro Kyrill Kondrashin.\\" Yampolsky holds a bachelor's degree in conducting from the Leningrad Conservatory and a second bachelor's degree and artist diploma in violin performance from the Moscow Conservatory.  Emigration from U.S.S.R.  Yampolsky left the Soviet Union in 1973 when a recommendation from Zubin Mehta led to an audition for Leonard Bernstein, who offered Yampolsky a scholarship at Tanglewood Music Center. Two weeks later, Yampolsky accepted a position in the violin section of the Boston Symphony (1973). He was later appointed the orchestra's principal second violinist (1975‚Äì1977).  Conductor  Yampolsky left the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1977 to become the music director of the Atlantic Symphony Orchestra in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The orchestra was Canada's only professional regional ensemble; Yampolsky was at its helm until financial problems caused its disbanding in 1983. At the same time, he also accepted a position as conductor of the Young Artists Orchestra at the Boston University Tanglewood Institute. In 1979, he was appointed adjunct professor of violin and director of orchestras at the Boston University School of Music. He was principal conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra in Johannesburg from 1993-1994. He also was resident conductor of the Chicago Civic Orchestra until 1997.  Omaha Symphony  Yampolsky was appointed music director of the Omaha Symphony Orchestra beginning with the 1995 season after the Omaha orchestra's two-year search process that included seven candidates, including Marin Alsop, Robert Spano and Fabio Mechetti. He replaced Bruce Hangen, who had directed the Omaha Symphony since 1984 and went on to become principal conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra's youth concerts and the Boston Pops until 2006. The symphony orchestra produced its first commercial recording, \\"Take Flight,\\" under Yampolsky‚Äòs baton in 2002. The symphony under Yampolsky also performed the world premiere of Philip Glass's Piano Concerto No. 2 (After Lewis and Clark). In 1997, the Utah Symphony disclosed that Yampolsky was among 12 vying to be its music director. \\"Utah Symphony president and CEO Donald L. Andrews confirmed that Yampolsky was invited to be a candidate several months ago, but until now, he preferred to have his candidacy kept confidential,\\" according to a 1997 Deseret News article. Yampolsky was not chosen for the Utah post. The Omaha Symphony's board of directors in 2004 declined to renew Yampolsky's contract, saying board members wanted someone more \\"charismatic\\" to lead the orchestra in the future as it moved to its $100 million purpose-built symphony hall, the 2,005-seat Holland Performing Arts Center.

Abrogatio or annulment of a citizen's rights was a necessary preliminary before he was sent into exile.Jo-Marie Claassen, \\"Exile, Roman,\\" in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 146. Abrogatio legis Abrogatio legis was the total repeal of a law. For example, the Lex Canuleia was an abrogation of the earlier law of the Twelve Tables that prohibited marriage between a patrician and a plebeian. A partial repeal of a law was either derogatio or exrogatio legis.A. Arthur Schilling, Roman Law: Mechanisms of Development (Mouton, 1978), p. 250, citing Cicero, De re publica 2.37.63 Originally, the comitia centuriata (\\"centuriate assembly\\") had to abrogate a law.George Mousourakis, The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law (Ashgate, 2003), p. 108. When Sulla became dictator, all the laws passed by his opponents (the populares) were abrogated.Mousourakis, The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law, p. 175. Abrogatio imperii Abrogatio imperii was the annulment of a magistrate's imperium (power or right to command). It was essentially the removal of a magistrate from office, and was \\"extremely rare\\".Karl Loewenstein, The Governance of Rome (Martinus Nijhoff, 1973), p. 73, note 41. Originally, the abrogatio imperii would have required the tribal assembly to pass a plebiscite, as was the case when a magistrate's imperium was extended past his elected term (prorogatio).Mousourakis, The Historical and Institutional Context of Roman Law, p. 81. Abrogatio was a preliminary step to prosecuting a magistrate, who was immune to prosecution during his term in office, and was usually initiated by a tribune of the plebs. Livy records three abrogationes from 217 to 204 BC, during the Second Punic War. Each case was brought by a tribune against a magistrate whose strategy in the field had met with objections at Rome, even though no military defeats or setbacks resulted. Personal rivalries seem to have among the motives. In 217, the tribune Marcus Metilius threatened to abrogate the command of Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, due to the stalling tactics which earned him the nickname Cunctator (\\"the Delayer\\"). Political resistance from the senate presumably caused Metilius to back down. In 209, the tribune Publicius Bibulus proposed the abrogation of the command held by Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who had not led his troops out even though Hannibal was at the time moving freely about Italy. In 204, the elderly Fabius Maximus urged the tribunes to abrogate the command of Scipio on the ostensible grounds that he had left his assigned province of Sicily without authorization from the senate; in actuality, his intention seems to have been to take advantage of any damage to Scipio's reputation from his association with the disreputable Pleminius, with the goal of thwarting Scipio's overall strategy of invading Africa in order to lure Hannibal out of Italy. None of these adrogationes succeeded.Rachel Feig Vishnia, State Society and Popular Leaders in Mid-Republican Rome 241-167 B.C. (Routledge, 1996), pp. 82‚Äì85, citing Livy 22.25.10 on Fabius Maximus; Livy 27.21.21.4 and 22.10‚Äì11 and Plutarch, Marcellus 27 on Claudius Marcellus; and Livy 22.25.10 on Scipio.

They were first discovered in 1939 when they were spotted by Lester Melrose, a representative for Victor Records while performing in Chicago. They were signed to Bluebird Records and released their first single \\"Nuts To You\\" b/w \\"Killin' Jive\\" in August of that year. They were also featured in the film Going Places, singing the song \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" with Louis Armstrong. In 1940, their first real hit came with the song \\"I Miss You So\\", a mid-tempo ballad penned by Jimmy Henderson which was later redone by the Orioles at a slower tempo. At this time Jimmy Henderson died from meningitis and was replaced briefly by Herbie Mills (a former member of the Harlem Harmony Hounds along with Austin Powell) in July 1940 until Tiny Grimes replaces him in January 1941. Shortly after, tragedy struck again and Chuck Barksdale died and was replaced by George Stienbeck. \\"I Miss You So\\" (written by Bertha Scott, Jimmy Henderson and Sid Robin) eventually became their best known song, it has been covered by many artists, like Paul Anka (1959 single release), Little Anthony and the Imperials (1965 single release), Charles Brown, Barry Young, Nat King Cole Trio, Tony Scotti, Earl Grant, Julie London (on Love Letters), Connie Francis, Diana Krall (on Love Scenes), Jermaine Jackson, Kay Starr (on Losers, Weepers), Mel Carter, Charlie Rich, Mickey Gilley, Chris Connor, Etta Jones (on Lonely and Blue), and The Mills Brothers. In 1942, Grimes left the group and was replaced by Mifflin \\"Pee Wee\\" Branford for the spot of First Tenor. Due to the war they did not record anything in 1942 but continued to make appearance for the next two years even after Austin Powell was drafted in 1943. While serving his country he was replaced by Hank Haslett briefly before Herbie Mills returned to the group. The lack of recordings may also be due to the 1942-1944 musicians' union strike.1942‚Äì44 musicians' strike In 1944, the Regis/Manor group of labels signed the Cats and the Fiddle where they re-recorded \\"I Miss You So\\" led by Ernie Price. Austin Powell then returned in 1946 to lead the group in \\"That's My Desire\\", which was later redone by the Channels in 1957. In 1947, Pee Wee Branford was replaced by Emmitt Slay briefly, until Johnny Davis took over the spot of First Tenor permanently. In 1948, a fifth member, Shirley Moore, was added to the group. Moore recorded four tracks with the group before being replaced by Doris Knighton.Rosalsky, Mitch. Encyclopedia of Rhythm & Blues and Doo-Wop Vocal Groups. Scarecrow Press, 2002 , 9780810845923. p. 62-64 In 1950, the Cats And The Fiddle recorded \\"I'll Never, Never Let You Go\\" with Gotham Records and \\"Wine Drinker\\" with Decca Records. They disbanded in 1951 and Powell formed the Austin Powell Quintet, which consisted of former Cats And The Fiddle members Johnny Davis, Stanley Gaines (Bass), Doris Knighton, as well as Beryl Booker, and Dottie Smith. They recorded two singles, \\"Some Other Spring\\" b/w \\"All This Can't Be True\\" and \\"Wishing Well\\" b/w \\"Please Consider Me\\" with Decca before disbanding about a year later.

The name \\"pork-knockers\\" refers to their regular diet of pickled pork of wild pig that is often eaten at the end of the day. Caribbean author A. R. F. Webber suggested that the term may have originated as \\"pork-barrel knocker\\". Satellite image of Guyana from 2004. A 1921 account observed that most pork-knockers of that era were of African descent and worked individually or in small groups. Pork-knockers have often been dependent on bush traders, who carry mining supplies and sometimes grubstake the pork-knockers' operations. Pork-knockers may work in close proximity to each other and disputed claims may lead to violence. Pork- knockers have been responsible for discovering large deposits of gold and diamonds. Many Guyanese stories describe pork-knockers who have made fortunes only to lose them in a tragic or comic fashion. Guyana-born author Jan Carew's 1958 novel Black Midas involves a boy leaving his coastal village to become a pork-knocker. The presence of pork-knockers in the Guyanese interior has upset traditional Amerindian life there. The Akawaio people have experienced land disputes with pork-knockers and have been adversely affected by a rising cost of living. Amazonian anthropologist Audrey Butt Colson observed that mining has led to a collapse of the subsistence economy.

It would have delivered diluted bitumen from Western Canada and North Western United States to Eastern Canada, from receipt points in Alberta, Saskatchewan and North Dakota to refineries and port terminals in New Brunswick and possibly Quebec. The TC PipeLines project would have converted about 3,000 kilometres of natural gas pipeline, which currently carries natural gas from Alberta to the Ontario-Quebec border, to diluted bitumen transportation. New pipeline, pump stations, and tank facilities also would have been constructed. The 12 billion pipeline would have been the longest in North America when complete. The project was announced publicly on August 1, 2013, while the Keystone XL pipeline proposal was being debated. In October 2014, TransCanada Pipelines filed its formal project application with the National Energy Board. At the same time a number of groups announced their intention to oppose the pipeline. The project was cancelled on October 5, 2017 by TransCanada.http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/transcanada-won-t-proceed-with- energy-east-pipeline-1.4338227?cmp=rss, CBC News (October 5, 2017). Project description The entire length would have been 4,600 kilometres, with approximately 70 percent (3,000 kilometres) being existing pipeline that would have been converted from carrying liquified natural gas to carrying diluted bitumen. The pipeline route would have run from Alberta to New Brunswick, crossing through Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. The original project proposal included a marine oil export terminal in Cacouna, Quebec, but that configuration was abandoned due to the impact it would have on a beluga whale habitat. The project would have had a capacity of 1.1 million barrels (~200,000 tonnes) of crude oil per day. Irving Oil had announced plans to build a new $300-million terminal at its Canaport facility in Saint John to export the oil delivered from the pipeline. Background In a November 10, 2011 phone call, then-President Barack Obama told then Prime Minister Stephen Harper that the Keystone XL approval process was on hold. In response, Frank McKenna, who was then Canadian Ambassador to the U.S., wrote a Financial Post opinion piece suggesting a west-east pipeline. In June 2013, Irving Oil's Arthur Irving and Frank McKenna discuss the TransCanada negotiations which have frustrated Irving and Irving and TransCanada finally reach a deal. The July 6, 2013 the fire and explosion with a blast radius in the Lac-M√©gantic rail disaster, the deadliest rail accident since Canada's confederation in 1867, took place. It was caused by the derailment of a freight train carrying Bakken Formation crude oil. Forty-two people died. About half of Lac-M√©gantic, Quebec downtown area was destroyed immediately and almost all the remaining downtown buildings had to be demolished because of petroleum contamination. There were a number of factors that contributed to TransCanada's October 5, 2017 decision to cancel the Energy East project, including \\"politics, the energy market and the economics of the energy industry.\\"Poitras‚Äîwho is the author of Pipe Dreams: The Fight for Canada's Energy Future‚Äîreported on New Brunswick news for CBC since 2000, and was the author of several books related to New Brunswick, including The Right Fight: Bernard Lord and the Conservative Dilemma, Beaverbrook: A Shattered Legacy, Imaginary Line: Life on an Unfinished Border, and Irving vs. Irving. His book Pipe Dreams won the 2018 Writers' Federation of New Brunswick Book Award for Non-Fiction and was shortlisted for the 2018 Writers' Trust Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing and the 2019 JW Dafoe Book Prize. Poitras spoke with a wide variety of Energy East stakeholders in preparing for his book, including leaders in First Nations communities, such as First Nation, Chief Elsie Jack of Carry the Kettle First Nation and Tundra Oil's CEO Ken Neufeld. Pipe Dreams: The Fight for Canada's Energy Future In 2015, National Energy Board members‚ÄîNEB's chief executive, Peter Watson, Lyne Mercier, Jacques Gauthier and Roland George \\"derailed\\" the Board's public hearings and were \\"forced to recuse themselves from further dealings with Energy East\\". They had held secret, private meetings in January 2015, with stakeholders, including Jean Charest, former Premier of Quebec who represented TransCanada at the time as a consultant. Board members were \\"supposed to handle all of their dealings with stakeholders in public.\\" Conservative MP, Lisa Raitt said the board members made a mistake with Energy East. \\"The NEB is there to make sure they do everything legally, by the book...If I were the minister in charge, I would read them the riot act.\\" Prior to the 2015 general election, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper renewed the mandates of all nineteen politically-appointed permanent NEB members. This prevented the \\"incoming government from making its own appointments to the regulator before the next federal election, scheduled for 2019.\\" The proposed route crossed the \\"traditional territory of 180 different aboriginal communities\\", Updated May 12, 2018 most of which were strongly against it. Each of the 180 may in law have had a veto under the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples which Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau had previously vowed to sign and uphold. This veto right was supported by some Canadian oil extraction corporations such as Suncor. Energy East had generated controversy in various areas. Some communities through which it was proposed to pass (notably North Bay, Kenora, and Thunder Bay) opposed it categorically. In partial response to these concerns, the NEB had planned to hear aboriginal oral evidence from 70 specific intervenors. The project was also strongly opposed by some Canadians on scientific grounds. The Pembina Institute released a report urging the National Energy Board to consider the impact on carbon emissions, estimating the project's upstream impact as being between 30 and 32 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year. This position was supported by the Governments of Ontario and Quebec, who had wanted the impact of the project on greenhouse gases examined as part of the National Energy Board review process, but did not oppose the project in principle. The Ontario Energy Board also had right to assert its own conditions and jurisdiction, but did not before the project was cancelled. Another controversial aspect was a new supertanker complex at the eastern end of the pipeline near Quebec City. Exploratory work was put on hold for a month after the Quebec Superior Court found that the Quebec environment ministry had not considered the impact of the project on beluga whales in the area. A public opinion poll held in Quebec found only one-third of Qu√©b√©cois supported the pipeline, while it was supported by one-half of Canadians outside of Quebec. Project endorsements and process concerns The project was endorsed by the Liberal Government of New Brunswick, which claimed it would create over 2000 construction jobs in a province with 11% unemployment. Former Conservative Party of Canada Prime Minister of Canada Stephen Harper endorsed the project, as did the Government of Alberta. This endorsement was renewed by the former NDP Premier of Alberta Rachel Notley after her government's election in 2015. The Saskatchewan Legislature unanimously endorsed a motion supporting the pipeline in November 2014, and the Premier of Saskatchewan Brad Wall called on Prime Minister Harper \\"to take leadership in supporting TransCanada‚Äôs proposed Energy East pipeline\\". Accordingly, the provincial governments of Alberta, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick were in support. Wall and Notley had taken the position that Ontario and Quebec could not \\"veto\\" the pipeline. The Maliseet First Nations raised concerns about the project during National Energy Board board hearings, but the six Maliseet first nations did not take a unified position on the project at that point, saying that they were reserving judgment pending the results of a traditional land use study and technical review.Maliseet First Nations voice concerns on Energy East pipeline, CBC News (August 16, 2016). TransCanada said that it would \\"strive to reach consent\\" with the First Nations to avoid and mitigate any possible adverse effects of the Energy East pipeline.TransCanada will 'strive to reach consent,' and avoid, mitigate any potential effects, VP tells public hearing, CBC News (August 10, 2016). Wall's (but not Notley's) position was that provincial equalization could be withheld from provinces that did not support the project. Ontario and Quebec had imposed approval conditions on Energy East but had dropped climate change concerns in December 2014. After the election of Justin Trudeau as Prime Minister in the 2015 Canadian federal election, and the replacement of Conservative pro- pipeline MPs with Liberal Party of Canada MPs along the entire route of the pipeline in New Brunswick and part of the route in Quebec, the Canadian federal position became unclear. The Prime Minister had strongly condemned the Harper-era process of regulation, citing serious conflict of interest and mandate flaws, and had also promised to \\"work with the provinces to map out a plan to reduce Canada's collective carbon footprint within 90 days of taking office by putting a price on carbon pollution.\\" Other Harper-era approvals such as Northern Gateway had been sharply criticized theprovince.com. and even called a \\"farce\\" by some public officials objecting to the lack of oral cross- examination. Northern Gateway was ultimately cancelled as well by the federal government in November 2016.

However, each generally had a primary temple, often on the Acropolis, dedicated to the god that was considered to have a special bond with the city and therefore to be its primary protector. These gods are sometimes referred as \\"poliad\\" gods (of the polis). Athena and Apollo are among the most common choices of patron gods of the ancient Greek cities Examples of city-state patron gods *Athens worshipped Athena, the goddess of wisdom, as a patron city-state god.Buckley 2010, p. 103 The designation of Athena as patron of Athens occurred during the Great Panathenaea in 566 B.C., potentially coinciding with construction of the Altar of Athena Polias.Buckley 2010, p. 110 An epithet of Athena commonly referred to as Athena Alea, served as patron of the cities of Alea, Mantinea and Tegea. *Sparta worshipped Apollo and Artemis Orthia as their patron deities.Pavlides, Nicolette.

He is currently the chairman and CEO of Camping World, Good Sam Enterprises, Gander Outdoors and The House Boardshop, in addition to being the star of The Profit, a CNBC reality show about saving small businesses. Early life and education Lemonis, named Ricardo, was born to parents Abdallel (from Lebanon) and Nadia (from Baniyas, Syria) in Beirut, Lebanon, during the chaos of civil war and foreign invasions. He was abandoned at an orphanage 4 days after his birth. He was adopted during his infancy on July 29, 1974 by Leo and Sophia Lemonis, a couple living in Miami, Florida. His adoptive father was Greek, and his adoptive mother was Lebanese. Lemonis was exposed to the automotive industry throughout his upbringing, his grandfather, Anthony Abraham owning two of the largest Chevrolet dealerships in the United States and Lee Iacocca serving as a family friend and later mentor and financial investor to Marcus, loaning him millions to start a recreational vehicle business. Lemonis graduated from Christopher Columbus High School in 1991, he went on and earned a bachelor's degree in political science and a minor in criminology from Marquette University in Milwaukee in 1995, and unsuccessfully ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Florida House of Representatives shortly after his graduation, whereupon he refocused his career on the automotive industry.

Iaccoca helped Lemonis start and acquire Holiday RV Superstores. From June 2001 to February 2003 he served as CEO of Holiday RV Superstores Inc. Following that, he co-founded a company called FreedomRoads and began acquiring RV dealerships. In 2006, the company merged with Camping World with Lemonis as CEO, and then, in 2011, merged with Good Sam Enterprises, with Lemonis again at the helm. =Camping World= As the CEO of Camping World, Lemonis sponsored NASCAR driver John Andretti in 2014. In 2007, Lemonis and Camping World announced they were taking over sponsorship of the NASCAR East Series from Busch Beer for the 2008-09 seasons, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Series. Later that same year, they also announced sponsorship of the then Craftsman Truck Series, rebranding it the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, making the company one of the sport's top three sponsors. They renewed their sponsorship in 2014. Crain's Chicago Business featured him in their 2005 edition of \\"40 under 40\\"; and in 2008, Ernst & Young named him \\"Entrepreneur of the Year\\". In October 2016, Camping World went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: CWH) at $22 a share, giving the company a market value of approximately $2 billion. As of December 18, 2018, Camping World was trading at $14.46 per share.

The battle was part of Ma Chao's multiple attacks on Cao Cao following the Battle of Tong Pass in 211.  Background  Following Ma Chao's crushing defeat against Cao Cao's great numbers at Weinan, Ma Chao went on to fight without the strength he once had with the Guandong coalition and he started to besiege Jicheng in 213 when Cao Cao was fighting Sun Quan in Ruxukou with fellow officer Yang Ang (Ê•äÊòÇ). The siege was a success, but it did not take long until an uproar against Ma Chao occurred causing the Battle of Lucheng. Yang Fu defeated Ma Chao, and as Ma fled from the scene, he re-met with Yang. This time, Ma took the offensive and struck Yang Fu violently with his spear. Thus, injuring him severely. To add on, Ma Chao's generals Pang De and Ma Dai fled from Liang Province to take refuge with the warlord Zhang Lu. Ma Chao would end up joining them as well.  The battle  = Zhang Lu gives troops to Ma Chao = It did not take long until Ma Chao took another attempt to wage war with Cao Cao. He persuaded Zhang Lu to lend him troops in order to wage war with Cao in the Spring of 214. The troops were lent so Ma Chao could attempt to recapture Liang Province. Zhang Lu sent Ma Chao off to besiege Qi Mountain. = Zhang He leads the vanguard = When the threat started, Xiahou Yuan was informed of Ma's advance by Jiang Xu. However, Xiahou Yuan was counseled by his officers who recommended that they wait for orders directly from Cao Cao. Xiahou Yuan replied reasoning that Cao Cao was in Ye, and it was too far for reports to be swapped if Jiang Xu and his people were to survive. Xiahou Yuan began his advance, sending general Zhang He as the vanguard of 5,000 troops. Ma Chao was quickly defeated and fled. = Xiahou Yuan defeats Han Sui = Xiahou Yuan then planned to attack Han Sui with surprise while he was stationed in Xianqin, hoping to capture him. However, Han Sui escaped. Xiahou Yuan ordered his forces to begin pursuit, chasing him into Lueyang. At the time, Xiahou Yuan was 15,000 meters away from Han Sui and many encouraged the continuation of the pursuit. However, another suggestion was given that favored attacking the Di barbarians from Xingguo. Xiahou Yuan knew that Han Sui's men were well trained and that the walls of Xingguo were strong, therefore quick victory was not an option. He then suggested attacking the Qiang at Changli. He suggested that since many of the Qiang's people have joined Han Sui's ranks, attacking the Qiang will draw the people to leave him to provide aid in the Qiang's defense. This would weaken Han Sui's forces. On the other hand, if Han Sui reinforced Changli he would be vulnerable to an offensive. Xiahou Yuan split up with the rest of the army and led light troops to the Qiang camp of the Shaodang Qiang and Han Sui provided no assistance. When Xiahou Yuan's officers saw the size of Han Sui's army, they strongly suggested building a moat and stockades. However, Xiahou Yuan declined the suggestion reasoning that the troops would tire after the long march. Xiahou Yuan ordered the drum to be sounded, and Han Sui's forces were wiped out entirely. After that, he besieged Xingguo and forced King Qianwan of the Di people to flee to Ma Chao. The remaining forces under him surrendered to Xiahou Yuan. Immediately after, Xiahou Yuan also successfully attacked Gaoping and the Chuge people of the Xiongnu.  References  * Chen, Shou. Records of the Three Kingdoms (Sanguozhi). * Pei, Songzhi.

The town was established as one of the first communes in Queensland. History In response to the idea of communes promulgated by utopian William Lane, in 1893 the Queensland Government legislated the Queensland Co-operative Communities Land Settlement Act to allow a group of 30 or more men and their families to establish a commune in Queensland. This led to many groups forming to pursue the goal of establishing a commune; one of these groups called themselves Byrnestown after the then Queensland Attorney- General Thomas Joseph Byrnes (who would become Premier of Queensland in 1898). In late 1893, the groups were offered sites near Roma but, following an inspection, the Byrnestown group rejected that location believing that the sites offered were too far from the town. In January 1893, the Byrnestown group inspected land in the Burnett area and found it suitable, having a water supply from the Wetherton Creek and frontage to the prospective railway to Gayndah. As a result, the Byrnestown commune (comprising 34 members) was registered on 24 February 1894 receiving for an 8-year term. Another group calling themselves Resolute selected land immediately to the east of the Byrnestown group, while a third group Bon Accord also took land in the Burnett area at Bon Accord. The first of the Byrnestown settlers arrived in March 1894. Although all communes were given initial funds, by June 1894, Byrnestown requested and received additional financial assistance. By October 1894, there were 169 people in the Byrnestown commune: 34 men, 28 wives and 107 children. The group had erected numerous bark dwellings, farm buildings and were beginning work on a school building, but had made more limited progress on clearing and planting the land. \\"Showing how six Byrnestown socialists paid the penalty of a too strict adherence to principle\\", cartoon, 1895 The Byrnestown commune did not succeed. As early as November 1894, there were allegations (denied by the group) that some of their members were working outside the commune but not contributing their wages to the commune as their agreement required. The following month some members were petitioning the government for funds, saying that the commune's management committee was denying them food. At the agricultural show at Degilbo in February 1895, it was revealed that 6 men had left the group and a further 9 were refusing to work, with the group's secretary suggesting the internal disputes arose from differences in nationality and religion. An inspection in April 1895 reported on limited progress at cultivation of the land, possibly linked to the number of men in the group working outside the commune. By July 1895, members of group had resorted to legal action over the management committee refusal to provide food to members who disagreed with their decisions. Byrnestown was not alone in its failure; in August 1895 a report by the Under-Secretary for Agriculture revealed most of the communes established were \\"in a state of collapse\\" and that there was little prospect of them being economically self- supporting. One small success for the commune was the opening of the Byrnestown Provisional School on 4 September 1895. However, the Byrnestown commune soon complained that children from the neighbouring Resolute commune were attending their school without contributing to it. In October 1895 the Byrnestown committee instituted a system of punishments for any member (or their wife) who criticised their commune or suggested it might not be a success. In December 1895, the Queensland Government passed legislation to enable communes to be dissolved and the communal land divided among the members. The members of Byrnestown immediately petitioned the Queensland Government to divide their communal land into individual portions. In April 1896, of the Byrnestown communal land was divided among 16 of its members, bringing the commune to an end. Those members who chose to take up individual land generally succeeded in their enterprise and were described less than two years later in February 1896 as \\"doing pretty well\\", suggesting that dissolution of the commune had rid the community of those men unsuited to agriculture or generally disinclined to work. In 1903, there were over under cultivation, growing mostly maize, potatoes and fodder crops; the main barrier to greater prosperity was the distance to the railway. The Byrnestown Provisional School was originally housed in a bark humpy, but, through the efforts of Roman Catholic priest Father Michael Joseph McKiernan, it was replaced by a more substantial building. It became a state school in 1909. A second school, Byrnestown Central State School, opened on 20 May 1913, after which the first school was often known as Old Byrnestown School. The old school closed in 1931 and its buildings were relocated in 1932 to Wilson Valley. In 1938, Byrnestown Central State School was renamed Byrnestown State School. It closed on 31 December 1970. Byrnestown Post Office opened by November 1903 (a receiving office had been open from 1898) and closed in 1911. Byrnestown Railway Station Post Office opened by June 1910 (a receiving office had been open from 1909, briefly known as Ginoon) and closed in 1974.Church of the Sacred Heart, 1925In August 1913, local residents desired to establish a Roman Catholic church in the town. At that time, the town had a hall which was used both for church services and recreational purposes, but following the establishment of a concert hall by Mr Christensen, the hall was only used for church services. Peter McSween senior donated an acre of land for the church and the residents decided to relocate the old hall to the donated land. On 25 July 1914 Archbishop James Duhig opened St Peter's Catholic Church with 250 people in attendance. The new church was made of weatherboard and was with a sacristry and vestry in the rear of the church and an \\"artistic\\" porch at the front. The building was designed and built by local contractor Harry Head. On 1 December 1923 the church was blown down in a storm. It was decided in August 1924 to construct a new church rather than try to repair the damaged building. The contract for the new church was given to George William Jealous of Gayndah at a cost of over ¬£1000. The new Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart was opened in Byrnestown on 22 February 1925 by Roman Catholic Archbishop James Duhig. The church was damaged in a cyclone in 1959. In 1969 the church was moved to Gayndah to serve as the church hall for St Joseph's Catholic Church there. To reduce the risk of future cyclone damage, the roof was lowered by reducing the height of the walls and reducing the pitch of the roof. In May 1931, a railway carriage carrying the Queensland Premier Arthur Edward Moore and Robert Boyd MLA and their wives came detached during shunting operations at the Gooroolba junction and rolled away, gathering speed down a streep grade. It hurtled, swaying dangerously, through Byrnestown railway station and eventually came to a halt five miles later on flat ground near the Wetheron railway station. Nobody was hurt.

This album showcases Klugh playing solo guitar on 13 of the 16 songs included here. Bill Frisell, Jake Shimabukuro, and Vince Gill all co-produced and played on one song each. Reception Writing for Allmusic, critic Thom Jurek wrote, \\"It's been five years since Earl Klugh issued the smooth chamber group offering The Spice of Life.\\" \\"It's been a long time since we heard Klugh this way, almost totally solo, taking an intimate look at music he loves from across the spectrum.

He opens with Burt Bacharach's \\"Alfie,\\" holding true to the original‚Äôs melody, but adding his trademark harmonic twists and turns, as well as occasional technical flash.\\" Brent Faulkner of PopMatters gives the album 7 out of a possible 10 and concludes his review with, \\"Ultimately, Handpicked is pleasant showing the total musician flexing his muscles. The bar has long been established for Klugh, but this effort is definitely confirmation of his elite status.\\" Matthew Alley reviews the album for Black Grooves and concludes, \\"While it may be a bit inconsistent at times, overall Handpicked is a strong effort from the virtuoso guitarist and is well- deserving of its Grammy nomination for Best Pop Instrumental Album of 2013.

He appeared in several Hollywood films of the 1940s, notably playing himself in the musicals Thousands Cheer (1943), Music for Millions (1944), Anchors Aweigh (1945), That Midnight Kiss (1949), and Three Daring Daughters (1948), his only leading role. Biography Born in Valencia, Spain, Iturbi showed a talent for classical music at an early age, and began musical studies there. He later moved to Paris in order to proceed with his studies with Victor Staub at the Paris Conservatory on a scholarship from the Diputaci√≥ de Valencia. At this time, he also undertook studies in keyboard technique and interpretation with the harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. His worldwide concert tours, beginning around 1912, were very successful. He made his American debut in New York City in 1929. Between 1911 and 1937, he was the frequent accompanist to the Spanish violinist Manuel Quiroga on his international tours. On 8 June 1937, he had just said goodbye to Quiroga after a concert in New York when the violinist was hit by a truck in Times Square, which led to the premature end of his career. Iturbi made his first appearance as a conductor in Mexico City in 1933 when presented by impresario Ernesto de Quesada from Conciertos Daniel. In April 1936, Iturbi was injured in the crash and sinking of Pan American Airways' Puerto Rican Clipper in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. After the incident, he said he would not be able to play \\"for some time\\", and \\"I may not be able to conduct again.\\"\\"3 die in airliner in Trinidad crash; Jose Iturbi hurt\\", The New York Times. 12 April 1936. pg. 1 Later that year, he was named conductor of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra in Rochester, New York, serving until 1944. He also led the Valencia Symphony Orchestra for many years. He often appeared in concert with his sister, Amparo, also a renowned pianist.Jean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, ¬´ Solo de duo ¬ª, Neva Editions, 2015, p.97. The liner notes to the two- record box set of Gershwin: Rhapsody in Blue (two-piano arrangements by Jos√© and Amparo Iturbi) read: > Arranged by Jos√© and Amparo Iturbi with the former conducting the RCA Victor > Symphony Orchestra as well as playing one of the two solo parts ... The > arrangers use the two pianos to thicken resonances and to invigorate what > was purely orchestral tissue with the bony brittleness of the piano. ... The > Iturbis perform this spirited work in a brilliant virtuoso fashion ...RCA > Victor WDM 1366 (2) Iturbi was also a noted harpsichordist and made several short instructional films using the re-emergent early 20th-century French Pleyel et Cie pedaled metal-framed harpsichord made famous by Wanda Landowska. He appeared as an actor-performer in several filmed musicals of the 1940s, beginning with 1943's Thousands Cheer for MGM and in Three Daring Daughters in 1948, again playing himself, and starring with Jeanette MacDonald. He usually appeared as himself in these films. He later was featured in MGM's Anchors Aweigh, which starred Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra, as well as in several other MGM movies. In the biopic about Fr√©d√©ric Chopin, A Song to Remember, Iturbi's playing was used in the soundtrack in scenes where Cornel Wilde, as Chopin, was playing the piano. Personal life Iturbi married Mar√≠a Giner de los Santos in 1916; she died in 1928. They had one child, Mar√≠a. Iturbi's daughter married Stephan Hero, an American concert violinist who had been one of her father's prot√©g√©s in 1936. They had two daughters, Maria Antonia and Maria Theresa, then separated in 1939. Mar√≠a Hero had obtained legal custody of the children in her 1941 divorce; her former husband had them for three months of each year. In 1943, Iturbi took his daughter to court for custody of the girls, calling her unfit, according to The New York Times. At age 28, in 1946, Iturbi's daughter committed suicide. Hero absconded with his daughters while Iturbi was on a European concert tour in 1947. After a court battle of several months, Iturbi and his former son-in-law ultimately resolved their differences, and the girls remained with their father. Iturbi's companion for many years was Marion Seabury, his secretary, who survived him and founded the Jos√© Iturbi Foundation after his death. Death Jos√© Iturbi continued his public performances into his 80s. He was ordered by his doctors to take a sabbatical in March 1980. He died on 28 June 1980, five days after being admitted to Cedars-Sinai Hospital for heart problems. He was 84 years old. Legacy Two music competitions have been established in Iturbi's name: * the Valencia International Piano Competition Prize Iturbi commenced in 1981; it often known as the Jos√© Iturbi International Piano Competition * the Jos√© Iturbi International Music Competition commenced in 2007 and awards prizes for pianists and opera singers. The Philharmonic Concert Hall in Valencia is named after Jose Iturbi. In popular culture Iturbi is referenced in Philip Roth's bestselling Portnoy's Complaint, where the women in Portnoy's neighborhood call a talented young pianist \\"Jos√© Iturbi the Second\\". The pianist kills himself because of his overpowering mother and thus becomes a memento to the protagonist, who also has to deal with a dominant mother. Cormac McCarthy honored Iturbi with a moment of colloquial humor in Suttree, his semi-autobiographical novel published in 1979. Conversing with his Aunt Martha on the topic of dogs once owned between himself and his ancestors, he proclaimed \\"We had one named Jose Iturbi. Because it was the peeinest dog.\\" One episode of the 1940s radio sitcom Amos 'n' Andy featured Iturbi unexpectedly getting a piano lesson from Andy Brown (who received a certificate from a correspondence school) and George \\"Kingfish\\" Stevens.

An anime television series adaptation produced by Studio Deen premiered on January 9, 2014. Both are notable for their extreme graphic violence. Plot The story of Pupa is about two teenagers, Utsutsu and his little sister Yume. Their father was an extremely abusive man, beating their mother and then his children after he was fired. After a divorce, their mother began dating another man, and the father left the two kids alone. Now abandoned, Utsutsu promised himself that he would always protect Yume. After seeing red butterflies, these two siblings become infected with a virus known as Pupa. This virus mutates organisms into insatiable monsters, only seeking to feed on any sort of life. Yume succumbs to the full effects of the Pupa virus, but reverts into a human. Utsutsu, instead of turning into a monster, gains regenerative powers. In order for the virus to be suppressed in Yume, Utsutsu must take a drug and have Yume feed on his flesh. Characters ; : :Yume's older brother. Due to having a sister complex, he cares very deeply for Yume. His most prominent facial feature is a scar around his left eye, which is the product of his father's abuse. Also conspicuous are the many round wounds that almost cover his entire body, that are in fact burns left when his father extinguished his cigars on him, and his flower hair clip. After being infected by the Pupa virus, Utsutsu gains the ability to heal his wounds and regenerate lost limbs. Thus, he acts as a living food source to satisfy his sister's hunger for flesh after she was infected by the virus. Although depicted as warm and somewhat outgoing, he has a tendency to turn sadistic, much like his father, going on a murderous rampage when frustrated. :In later chapters, he also gains the ability to metamorphose into a flesh-eating monster, which looks like a black butterfly. However, it is revealed that the red butterflies never infected the Hasegawa siblings, merely awakening their instincts as monsters, since Yume was a monster all along and Utsutsu was infected by her. As a child, Utsutsu attempted to save Yume from an oncoming truck, but ended up getting himself killed instead (unaware that Yume was a monster and could easily heal herself); Yume then \\"revived\\" him as a monster by feeding him some of her flesh. By feeding her flesh to him, she left an imprint of herself in him, which is why Utsutsu sees Yume as an emotional crutch. The scar over his eye was actually inflicted by Yume, and Utsutsu was simply in denial and blamed his father for it. ; : :Utsutsu's innocent and sweet younger sister and a victim of the Pupa virus. She loves her brother and has always looked up to him. If she is famished, a hideous monstrosity emerges from her body like a red butterfly emerging from its pupa. Much to her horror, the monster then proceeds to eat any flesh it can, including that of humans. :Yume is actually one of two ancient immortal monsters that had the bad luck to be found in larval form by Maria, then being kept and experimented on for 30 years. She escaped, leaving her mate Yuu behind, and impregnates Sachiko Hasegawa, being reborn as a human girl (even sharing Sachiko's DNA) and losing her memories of being a monster. As a child, she lacked common sense because she was adapting to her human body and behaved like a monster. She is the one who gave Utsutsu the scar across his eye, and was also responsible for metamorphosing him into a monster like her. ; : :Utsutsu's and Yume's sensitive mother. She cares for her biological son, but is fearful of her daughter, knowing she is a monster. After she and Shir≈ç divorced, she began dating a young man, leaving Utsutsu and Yume alone. :In fact, she is now a permanent resident of Bizen's hospital, having been driven insane because of Yume. On the day that she gave birth to Utsutsu, a monster escaped from the laboratory, impregnating Sachiko and being born as a human named Yume. Sachiko attempted abortion to kill her, but she failed each time since Yume was immortal. She became increasingly paranoid until she finally left the house. ; : :Utsutsu's and Yume's cold and abusive father, who works for a mysterious organization. He searches obsessively for Utsutsu and wants to know the truth about the Pupa virus, since his son became infected with it. He was abusive towards Sachiko because he knew that Yume wasn't his daughter, but, not knowing about the Pupa virus, he believed that Sachiko had been unfaithful. After finding out the truth about Yume's origin, he attempts to protect Utsutsu in his own way. :It is revealed that he is unstable because as a child he was an orphan raised by Genjurou Imari (Maria's grandfather) who was an artist. Genjurou abused Shiro and kept him as a plaything, claiming that pain was the purest form of love. After Genjurou died, Shiro adopted his philosophy, abusing Sachiko and Utsutsu in an attempt to show them the \\"love\\" he was taught. ; : :A mysterious woman who seems to have knowledge of the Pupa virus and is currently conducting experiments regarding it. She has a pet cat named Seto. Her research has given her a cold view toward human life. She is willing to sacrifice the lives of many innocent people to gain information about the effects of the virus. In return for being able to examine them, she gives Utsutsu a drug that temporarily suppresses his sister's rampage. Unlike Sachiko, she plans to give birth to these monsters from the cells she obtained from the Hasegawa siblings. ; : :An associate of Maria's and her older brother. It is said his mother gave birth to the demon \\"Ai\\" instead of Juzo Hotoki. Finding her first impression restless then noticed she was interested in the contents of animals. He scarred Maria's face for tormenting his precious dolls and felt pitiful for not understanding. Since then, he devoted himself into helping Maria's research of the Pupa virus on Onigashima island. ; : :Utsutsu's classmate and close friend who insists on staying in touch. ; :A mysterious man who appears to guide the Hasegawa siblings. Despite appearing human, he claims to be a monster of the red butterflies who has lived for many generations on the remote island of Onigashima, and explains the reason why Utsutsu and Yume were infected. He is searching for his lost mate, who he claims is Yume. :In fact, he is one of two ancient immortal monsters that had been uncovered in larval form by Maria, then being kept and experimented on for 30 years. His mate escaped, leaving him behind, and was reborn as Yume, losing all of her memories of him. He envies Utsutsu for Yume to have chosen over him.

Johnny catches the interest of media executive √Ålvaro Aguirre, but Aguirre will only pay the sums that Johnny desires if Roberto stays at the site of the accident, as an interview at the hospital is worthless to him. Aguirre offers several million euros for a posthumous interview, but Johnny is not able to convince him to invest the money without a guarantee. Luisa becomes concerned that Roberto is spending too much time on financials and not enough on talk to his family; at her urging, he calls their children and requests that they visit him. Mercedes offers to cut free the spike, but the others stop her when it becomes obvious that it will only injure Roberto. After deliberating with another physician, Dr. Velasco decides to perform surgery at the site. Before the surgery, Johnny approaches Luisa and tells her of the offer for the posthumous interview. Enraged, she fires Johnny and threatens to attack him if he approaches Roberto again. Roberto, not knowing that she has fired Johnny, inquires as to the progress Johnny has made. Not wanting to upset Roberto, she tells him that Johnny has signed a contract worth hundreds of thousands of euros. Happy to have finally provided for his family financially, Roberto gives a heartfelt interview to Pilar √Ålvarez, a local television reporter handpicked by Luisa. √Ålvarez hands the tape to Luisa, knowing that it is worth millions to the proper buyer. Roberto is lifted from the spike and becomes delirious. Brain damaged, he describes various smells as he bleeds profusely from the wound. Claudio consoles Luisa as she waits for Dr. Velasco's report. Some time later, Dr. Velasco grimly reappears. Roberto's family rush to see him, only to find that he has died during surgery. The crowd, which has swelled greatly during the media frenzy, collectively reacts with dismay, and many of the people cry. Aguirre arrives at the museum and personally offers Luisa several million euros for the tape, which she silently and angrily refuses.

An example of Brecht's epic theatre, the play is a parable about a peasant girl who rescues a baby and becomes a better mother than its wealthy natural parents. The play was written in 1944 while Brecht was living in the United States. It was translated into English by Brecht's friend and admirer Eric Bentley and its world premiere was a student production at Carleton College, Northfield, Minnesota, in 1948. Its first professional production was at the Hedgerow Theatre, Philadelphia, directed by Bentley. Its German premiere by the Berliner Ensemble was on October 7, 1954, at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm in Berlin. The Caucasian Chalk Circle is one of Brecht's most celebrated works and one of the most regularly performed 'German' plays. It reworks Brecht's earlier short story \\"Der Augsburger Kreidekreis.\\" Both derive from the 14th-century Chinese play The Chalk Circle by Li Xingdao. Plot summary =Prologue= Brecht, in his typical anti- realist style, uses the device of a \\"play within a play\\". The \\"frame\\" play is set in the Soviet Union around the end of the Second World War. It shows a dispute between two communes, the Collective Fruit Farm Galinsk fruit growing commune and the Collective Goat Farmers, over who is to own and manage an area of farm land after the Nazis have retreated from a village and left it abandoned. A parable has been organised by one group, an old folk tale, to be played out to cast light on the dispute. The Singer, Arkadi Tcheidse, arrives with his band of musicians, then tells the peasants the fable, which forms the main narrative, and intertwines throughout much of the play. The Singer often takes on the thoughts of characters, enhances the more dramatic scenes with stronger narration than simple dialogue, and is responsible for most scene and time changes. Often the role is accompanied by several \\"musicians\\" (which incorporate music into the play itself) that help the Singer keep the play running smoothly. At the end he states that the land should go to those who will use it most productively, the fruit growers, and not those who had previous ownership. =Scene one: The Noble Child= The Singer's story begins with Governor Georgi Abashwili and his wife Natella blatantly ignoring the citizens on the way to Easter Mass. The Singer shows us the show's antagonist, Arsen Kazbeki, the Fat Prince. He sucks up to the pair and remarks how their new child Michael is \\"a governor from head to toe.\\" They enter the church, leaving the peasants behind. Next to be introduced is the heroine Grusha Vashnadze, a maid to the governor's wife. Grusha, while carrying a goose for the Easter meal, meets a soldier, Simon Shashava, who reveals he has watched her bathe in the rivers. She storms off enraged. The Singer continues the story as the soldier contacts two architects for the Governor's new mansion, the Ironshirts, gestapo-esque guards, turn on him. The Fat Prince has orchestrated a coup and is now in control. The Governor is quickly beheaded. Simon finds Grusha and proposes, giving her his silver cross. Grusha accepts. Simon runs off to fulfill his duty to the Governor's wife, who has been foolishly packing clothing for the \\"trip\\", caring nothing for the loss of her husband. She is carried off, away from the flaming city of Nuhka and inadvertently leaves her son, Michael, behind. Grusha is left with the boy and, after seeing the Governor's head nailed to the church door, takes him with her to the mountains. Music is often incorporated throughout much of this scene with the aid of the Singer, musicians, and possibly Grusha, as Brecht includes actual \\"songs\\" within the text. =Scenes two and three: Flight into the Northern Mountains/In the Northern Mountains = The Singer opens the scene with an air of escape. At the beginning of this act Grusha is seen trying to escape but has to stop to get milk for the baby, Michael, and is forced to buy vodka expensively from an old man who claims his goats have been taken away by the soldiers. This encounter slows her and she is followed shortly by the Ironshirts. Grusha then finds a home for Michael to stay in. Abandoning him on the doorstep, he is adopted by a peasant woman. Grusha has mixed emotions about this, which change when she meets a perverted Corporal and Ironshirts who are looking for the child. He suspects something about her, and Grusha is forced to knock him out to save Michael. She wearily retreats to her brother's mountain farm. Lavrenti, Grusha's brother, fabricates a story to his jealous wife Aniko, claiming that Michael Abashwili is Grusha's child and she is on her way to find the father's farm. Grusha catches scarlet fever and lives there for quite some time. Rumours spread in the village, and Lavrenti convinces Grusha to marry a dying peasant, Jussup, in order to quell them. She reluctantly agrees. Guests arrive at the wedding‚Äìfuneral, including the Singer and musicians, which act as the hired musicians for the event, and gossip endlessly. It is revealed that the Grand Duke is overthrowing the princes and the civil war has finally ended, and no one can be drafted anymore. At this, the supposedly dead villager Jussup returns to \\"life\\", and it becomes clear he was only \\"ill\\" when the possibility of being drafted was present. Grusha finds herself married. For months, Grusha's new husband tries to make her a 'real wife' by consummating the marriage, but she refuses. Years pass, and Simon finds Grusha while washing clothes in the river. They have a sweet exchange before Simon jokingly asks if she has found another man. Grusha struggles to tell him she has unwillingly married, then Simon spots Michael. The following scene between the two is told predominantly by the Singer, who speaks for each of the two characters' thoughts, and is easily the most heartbreaking part of the play. However, Ironshirts arrive carrying Michael in, and ask Grusha if she is his mother, she says that she is, and Simon leaves distraught. The Governor's Wife wants the child back and Grusha must go to court back in Nukha. The Singer ends the act with questions about Grusha's future, and reveals that there is another story we must learn: the story of Azdak. If an intermission is used, this is generally where it is placed. =Scene four: The Story of the Judge = The scene opens as if a different play entirely, yet set within the same war setting, is beginning. The Singer introduces another hero named Azdak. Azdak shelters a \\"peasant\\" and protects him from authorities by a demonstration of convoluted logic. He later realises that he sheltered the Grand Duke himself; since he thinks the rebellion is an uprising against the government itself, he turns himself in for his \\"class treason\\". But the rebellion isn't a populist one ‚Äì in fact, the princes are trying to suppress a populist rebellion occurring as a result of their own ‚Äì and Azdak renounces his revolutionary ideas to keep the Ironshirts from killing him as a radical. The Fat Prince enters, looking to secure the Ironshirts' support in making his nephew a new judge. Azdak suggests they hold a mock trial to test him; the Fat Prince agrees. Azdak plays the accused in the trial ‚Äì the Grand Duke. He makes several very successful jabs against the Princes' corruption, and amuses the Ironshirts enough that they appoint him instead of the Fat Prince's nephew: \\"The judge was always a chancer; now let a chancer be the judge!\\" Azdak remains himself on the bench. He uses a large law book as a pillow to sit on. What follows is a series of short scenes, interspersed by the \\"song\\" of the Singer, in which he judges in favor of the poor, the oppressed, and good- hearted bandits; in one set of cases in which all the plaintiffs and the accused are corrupt, he passes a completely nonsensical set of judgments. But it doesn't last forever; the Grand Duke returns to power, the Fat Prince is beheaded, and Azdak is about to be hanged by the Grand Duke's Ironshirts when a pardon arrives appointing \\"a certain Azdak of Nuka\\" as a judge in gratitude for \\"saving a life essential to the realm\\", i.e. the Grand Duke's own. \\"His Honour Azdak is now His Honour Azdak;\\" the wife of the beheaded governor instantly dislikes him, but decides he'll be needed for the trial in which she'll recover her son from Grusha. The act closes with Azdak obsequious and afraid for his life, promising to restore Michael to the Governor's Wife, behead Grusha, and do whatever else the Governor's Wife wants: \\"It will all be arranged as you order, your Excellency. As you order.\\" =Scene five: The Chalk Circle= We have returned to Grusha's story. We meet Grusha in court, supported by a former cook of the Governor and Simon Shashava, who will swear he is the father of the boy. Natella Abashvili comes in with two lawyers, who each reassure her things will be taken care of. Azdak is beaten by Ironshirts, who are told he is an enemy of the state. A rider comes in with a proclamation, stating the Grand Duke has reappointed Azdak as judge. Azdak is cleaned up and the trial begins. The trial, however, does not begin with Grusha and the Governor's wife, but with a very elderly married couple who wish to divorce. Azdak is unable to make a decision on this case, so he sets it aside to hear the next case on the docket. The prosecution comes forth and liberally bribes Azdak in hopes of swinging the verdict. It is revealed that Natella only wants the child because all the estates and finances of the Governor are tied to her heir and cannot be accessed without him. Grusha's defence does not go over well, as it develops into her and Simon insulting Azdak for taking bribes. Azdak fines them for this but, after consideration, claims he can't find the true mother. He decides that he will have to devise a test. A circle of chalk is drawn, and Michael is placed in the centre. The true mother, Azdak states, will be able to pull the child from the centre. If they both pull, they will tear the child in half and get half each. The test begins but (akin to the Judgment of Solomon) Grusha refuses to pull as she cannot bear to hurt Michael. Azdak gives her one more chance, but again she cannot pull Michael. During this dilemma, a poignant song is sung by the Singer as a reflection of Grusha's thoughts toward Michael. The others onstage cannot hear this, but they feel the overwhelming emotion through Grusha. Azdak declares that Grusha is the true mother, as she loves Michael too much to be able to hurt him. The Governor's wife is told that the estates shall fall to the city and be made into a garden for children called \\"Azdak's Garden\\". Simon pays Azdak his fine. Azdak tells the old couple he shall divorce them, but \\"accidentally\\" divorces Grusha and the peasant man, leaving her free to marry Simon. Everyone dances off happily as Azdak disappears. The Singer remarks upon Azdak's wisdom and notes that in the ending, everyone got what they deserved. =Music= Brecht wrote a number of 'songs' as part of the piece, and one of its main characters is called the Singer. In 1944 the production was scored by Paul Dessau. Though there is no officially published score, the show is generally played with original music and songs performed by the cast. Many composers have created unique original scores for The Caucasian Chalk Circle. One score performed regularly is by American composer Mark Nichols, who based his music on traditional Georgian folk harmonies in polyphony. Georgian composer Giya Kancheli made an iconic score for the production of Rustaveli Theatre in Tbilisi. Comments Brecht made a crucial change from the Chinese play which was his source. In it, it is the child's birth mother who lets go and wins custody of the child. Near the end of the prologue, the Singer says that this is an old story of Chinese origin, but with a modern re- write. The play is sometimes played without the prologue, and it was always played that way in the US during the McCarthy era. (The first US production to include the prologue was in 1965.) There is some dispute about how integral the prologue is to Brecht's conception of the play. Some claim that he regarded it as an integral part of his play, and it was present in the earliest drafts.Introduction to Methuen student edition Others claim that it was only included in later drafts.Introduction to Penguin Modern Classics version However, there is agreement that he originally intended to set in the 1930s, but later updated it. The setting of the play is clearly Georgia in the Caucasus, although it is described as \\"Grusinia\\" (a Russian variant name) in the main play. Most of the characters have Georgian (or Georgian-like) names, and Tiflis and the poet Mayakovsky are mentioned in the prologue.Mayakovsky and Brecht himself were both accused of \\"formalism\\" in the Soviet Union at times. However the city where much of the action takes place, Nuka, is in modern Azerbaijan, although it was under Georgian rule for a time in the Middle Ages. There are also Iranian elements in the play, including the name of the character Azdak, who says he comes from there. Brecht did not necessarily intend his play to be a realistic portrayal of either contemporary or medieval Georgia. Even in the Soviet Union, some people found it more German than Russian or Georgian, and pointed out that it did not accurately portray the decision-making procedures in Soviet agriculture.

Taxonomy One genus is placed in this family - Ophryocystis - with at least 10 species. This is the type family of the order Neogregarinorida. Lifecycle Most species in this family infect the Malpighian tubes of beetles. The trophozoite is conical in shape. Two types of schizogony occur in this family. In the first type the schizonts divide into merozoites with small nuclei. These are known as mycetoids merozoites. These develop into trophozoites. In the second form and more common form, the schizonts divide into merozoites with large nuclei: these are known as gregarinoid merozoites and give rise to gametocytes. The merozoites are uninucleated, pyriform cells. These are released into the lumen of the tube and from there infect other cells of the tube. The gametocytes possesses only a single nucleus and are globular in shape. When mature, these become detached from the epithelium. Within the lumen, the gametocytes associate in pairs, fuse and form a zygote. The zygote subsequently becomes a single octozoic spore.

It is located on the southeast corner of Front Street and Cherry Street, in the West Don Lands neighbourhood. The structure was originally the Palace Street School, which closed in 1887. The building was converted into a hotel, and later became an industrial building housing small industry. In the 1960s, the Canary Restaurant opened. The building became a type of incubator, renting small spaces for artists and small businesses. The restaurant closed after the area around the building was demolished for the new West Don Lands community. The building has been integrated into the new community and its facade retained and restored. Its next use has not been announced. History The building being used by the Tippet-Richardson moving company The Palace Street School opened in 1859. The school was designed by Joseph Sheard who later became Mayor of Toronto. The original name of Front Street in this area was Palace Street, giving the school its name. At the time, the area was a residential area. The building was built to serve an increasing number of residents in the area. It was a free school of the Toronto Board of Education. The school had two rooms, each holding 80-90 students; one for boys and one for girls. In 1882, when the structure was still a school, Georgina Riches was appointed its principal, stirring controversy. According to Nancy Kiefer, writing in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography, this controversy is often attributed to Riches being Toronto's first female principal to be paid the same as a man. Kiefer, however, wrote that some of the opposition came from other female teachers, who had more experience, or who had the first class teaching certificate Reid lacked. The school was closed in 1887, its students transferring to a school on nearby Sackville Street, where Riches was also transferred. The building was sold to Robert Irvine, who remodelled it as a 40-room hotel known as the Irvine House. It was later sold to Mr. Darcy, who renamed it the Cherry Street Hotel. In 1904, the hotel was renamed the Eastern Star Hotel. By 1910, the hotel had failed, and it was vacant from 1910 until 1922. It was taken over for industrial purposes by the Thomas Davidson Manufacturing Company, maker of enamel ware and Antipitzky Metal Company. An addition was built on the east side of the building and used for industrial and warehouse purposes, including the operation of General Steel Ware. Later, Tippet & Richardson operated out of the building. The neon sign for the old Canary Restaurant. In 1965, the Canary Restaurant relocated here from its original location at Dundas Street and University Avenue. Known as the Canary Grill, the restaurant was operated by the Vlahos family and it retained its 1960s era decor. Its preserved decor was used for location shots for films set in that era. The restaurant rented studio apartments to artists and spaces for small business. The restaurant was likely located in the former tavern of the hotel. The building was designated as a heritage structure on August 18, 1976. The restaurant closed in 2007, unable to survive the decline in business due to the demolition of the area. The interior was gutted, the signage removed and the brickwork and facades restored. Canary District To the east, the former industrial site of the Maple Leaf Mills pork processing plant lay vacant after its closure. The Government of Ontario started the Ataratiri redevelopment plan in the 1980s to convert the brownfield site and proceeded to demolish many of the buildings nearby. The hotel building was bought by the Government of Ontario and plans were made to convert it into a community centre. However, the ballooning cost of the project and a downturn in the real estate market led the Ontario government to cancel the project. To the south, the nearby Gooderham and Worts distillery complex closed in 1990, but it was repurposed as the Distillery District pedestrian district of shops, restaurants and a brewery (Mill Street Brewery) in the old buildings in the early 2000s. In 2001, the new Waterfront Toronto agency was established, and one of the projects to be undertaken was to redevelop the Ataratiri site and the surrounding properties as part of a general waterfront revitalization. As part of the new plan for the \\"West Don Lands\\", the structure, and the CN Railway Police building across the street were preserved and restored when almost all the other buildings east of Cherry Street were demolished. In 2013, construction began on the residential condominiums buildings, larger and taller buildings, that dwarf the hotel. Those buildings served as the 2015 Pan American Games Athletes' Village. After the games, the buildings became private residences, the \\"Canary District\\" development, named after the restaurant. Several other condominiums have been and will be developed.

They contain a vast diversity of omnivorous and carnivorous songbirds widespread in Africa and Australia, many of which superficially resemble shrikes. It was defined and named by Cacraft and colleagues in 2004 and contains the bushshrikes (Malaconotidae), helmetshrikes (Prionopidae), ioras (Aegithinidae), vangas (Vangidae) and the Australian butcherbirds, magpies, currawongs and woodswallows (Artamidae). Molecular analysis in 2006 added the Bornean bristlehead to the group, though its position in the Malconotoidea is unclear. It was initially thought related to the butcherbirds and woodswallows but now is thought to be an early offshoot. In 2012, Jerome Fuchs and colleagues extensively analysed the Malaconotoidea (called by them Malaconotidea), using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. The resulting tree suggested that the group originated in Australasia and prolifically diversified in Africa after an ancestor crossed to Africa between 45 and 33.7 million years ago during the late Eocene. This is based on the basal position of group comprising the woodswallows and butcherbirds and allies and (most likely) the boatbills. Complicating the picture is that some Malaysian species such as the Bornean bristlehead, flycatcher-shrikes, the Philentomas, and woodshrikes appear to be more closely related to African species. A cladistic study of the bony characteristics of the skulls of various Malaconotoidea and relatives, and focussing on vangas, published in 2008, found broad agreement in the inclusion of woodswallows, butcherbirds and vangas in Malaconotoidea, but also yielded some results at odds with other studies‚Äîthe red-backed shrike, crested drongo and magpie-lark were nested within the group. The authors conceded that there were not enough data to conclude these species should be placed here.

The Marriage Act 1961 applies uniformly throughout Australia (including its external territories) to the exclusion of all state laws on the subject. Australian law recognises only monogamous marriages, being marriages of two people, including same-sex marriages, and does not recognise any other forms of union, including traditional Aboriginal marriages,Australian Government, Law Reform Commission - Aboriginal Traditional Marriage: Areas for Recognition polygamous marriages or concubinage. The marriage age for marriage in Australia is 18 years, but in \\"unusual and exceptional circumstances\\" a person aged 16 or 17 can marry with parental consent and authorisation by a court. A Notice of Intended Marriage is required to be lodged with the chosen marriage celebrant at least one month before the wedding. There is no citizenship or residency requirement for marriage in Australia, so that casual visitors can lawfully marry in Australia, provided that a domestic marriage celebrant is employed, the requisite notice given, and other domestic requirements satisfied. Marriages performed abroad are normally recognised in Australia if entered into in accordance with the applicable foreign law, and do not require to be registered in Australia. It is not uncommon for Australian citizens or Australian residents to go abroad to marry. This may be to the family‚Äôs ancestral home country, to a destination wedding location or because they would not be permitted to marry in Australia. As was the case for other Western countries, marriage in Australia for most of the 20th century was done early and near-universally, particularly in the period after World War II to the early 1970s. Marriage at a young age was most often associated with pregnancy prior to marriage. Marriage was once seen as necessary for couples who cohabited. While some couples did cohabit before marriage, it was relatively uncommon until the 1950s in much of the Western world. According to a 2008 Relationships Australia survey love, companionship and signifying a lifelong commitment were the top reasons for marriage. Nature of marriage Australian law recognises only monogamous marriages, being marriages of two people, including same-sex marriages, and does not recognise any other forms of union, including traditional Aboriginal marriages,Australian Government, Law Reform Commission - Aboriginal Traditional Marriage: Areas for Recognition polygamous marriages or concubinage. A person who goes through a marriage ceremony in Australia when still legally married to another person, whether under Australian law or a law of another country, commits an offence of bigamy, which is subject to a maximum 5 years imprisonment, and the marriage is void. Since December 2017, Australian law has recognised same-sex marriage in Australia whether entered into in Australia or abroad.Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017 The original 1961 Marriage Act did not include a definition of marriage, leaving it to the courts to apply the common law definition.The definition is found in Hyde v Hyde (1866) {L.R.} 1 P. & D. 130: \\"I conceive that marriage, as understood in Christendom, may for this purpose be defined as the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others\\". The Marriage Amendment Act 2004 defined, for the first time by statute, marriage as \\"the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.\\" The 2004 Act also expressly declared same-sex marriages entered into abroad were not to be recognised in Australia. This was in response to a lesbian couple getting married in Canada and applying for their marriage to be recognised in Australia. In 2017, the definition of \\"marriage\\" was changed, replacing the words \\"a man and a woman\\" with \\"2 people\\" and therefore allowing monogamous same-sex marriages.Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act The changes also retrospectively recognised same-sex marriages performed in a foreign country, provided that such marriages were permitted under the laws of that foreign country. A marriage must be entered into with the full consent of both parties, and it is an offence to force someone to marry them or another person, by the use of coercion, threat or deception, and whether in Australia or abroad. Full consent assumes a mental capacity to understand the nature of a marriage. Most federal, state and territory laws also recognise de facto relationships, often on an equal basis to formal marital relationships. Marriageable age The marriageable age for marriage in Australia is 18 years, which is the age of majority in Australia in all states,Children‚Äôs Rights: Australia but in \\"unusual and exceptional circumstances\\" a person aged 16 or 17 can marry with parental consent and authorisation by a Magistrates Court. The application to the court must be filed by a parent. For many years, courts have refused to accept a minor's pregnancy as a pressing consideration in deciding whether to allow an early marriage. In addition, the older partner must be over 18. Until 1991, the marriage age was 16 for females and 18 for males, but a female 14 or 15 years (wanting to marry a male aged 18 or above) or a male 16 or 17 years (wanting to marry a female aged 16 or above) could apply to the court for permission to marry.http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C05245 The ages were equalised in 1991,Sex Discrimination Amendment Act 1991 with the relevant ages applying to females being raised to those applying to males. Void marriages A marriage entered into in Australia is void if: * either party is already married (bigamy, polygamy). * the parties are in a prohibited relationship: direct ancestor or descendant or sibling (whether full sibling or half sibling), including those arising from a legal adoption. * the marriage was not solemnised by an authorised celebrant. * there is no consent, for example due to duress, fraud, mistake as to identity, mistake as to the nature of ceremony, mental incapacity, or being below the marriageable age. Marriages of non-citizens  Australian citizenship is not a requirement for marriage in Australia, nor for the recognition of a foreign marriage. When one of the parties to a marriage is a non-citizen of Australia and the other is an Australian or New Zealand citizen or a permanent resident, the non-citizen may apply for an Australian ‚Äúpartner visa‚Äù to remain in Australia.Partner visa (apply in Australia) When marriages are entered into, whether in Australia or elsewhere, for the purpose of enabling the non-citizen to obtain an Australian visa to enter or stay in Australia, Australian authorities may investigate whether such a marriage is a sham. If found to be a sham, they may cancel the visa. Such behaviour also carries a possible 10 year jail sentence.'Easy money' for sham marriage: The women targeted by global syndicate Nevertheless, this does not effect the validity of the marriage itself. Solemnisation of marriages in Australia A marriage entered into in Australia is void (invalid) if it has not been ‚Äúsolemnised‚Äù by an authorised marriage celebrant. Only authorised marriage celebrants are allowed to solemnise marriages in Australia. There are three types of celebrants: ministers of religion, state and territory registry officers, and civil marriage celebrants. The only requirements for registration of a minister of religion is that he or she is nominated by a proclaimed \\"recognised denomination\\", is a resident in Australia, and is at least 21 years old. The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) was amended with the 2017 recognition of same-sex marriages to exempt a minister of religion or religious marriage celebrant or chaplain from the prohibition of sex discrimination by refusing to marry same-sex couples. State and territory officers who are allowed to register marriages (under a state law) can also solemnise marriages (i.e. registry marriages). Civil marriage celebrants are authorised to conduct and solemnise civil wedding ceremonies. For registration, they must meet a number of requirements, in addition to being at least 18 years old and \\"fit and proper\\" persons. The register will take into account knowledge of the law, commitment to advising couples about relationship counselling, community standing, criminal record, the existence of a conflict of interest or benefit to business, and \\"any other matter\\", which includes professional development and an adherence to a code of practice. Most marriages in Australia are solemnised by civil celebrants. Notice of Intended Marriage Couples must give their marriage celebrant a Notice of Intended MarriageNotice of Intended Marriage (Form 13 - regulation 38 - Marriage Act 1961). at least one month before the intended wedding ceremony. The Notice is valid for 18 months.Getting married In exceptional circumstances, the couple can apply for a waiver of the one-month waiting period, This Notice is not a marriage licence, as a couple does not normally require an official authorisation to marry, but a person under the age of 18 wishing to marry requires parental consent and the authorisation of a judge. Wedding ceremony  The couple must wait at least one month after giving their marriage celebrant the Notice of Intended Marriage before the wedding ceremony. Both parties to the marriage must be present at the ceremony, with proxy marriages not permitted. The marriage celebrant and two witnesses over the age of 18 years must also be present,Marriage Act 1961, s.44 besides other guests. The witnesses must sign the certificate prepared by the celebrant. The celebrant is required to recite the prescribed words to solemnise the marriage.Marriage Act 1961, s.46 Otherwise, almost anything is permitted. For example, it can be at any venue, indoors or outdoors, at any day or time,Marriage Act 1961, s.43 and follow any tradition or custom, or none at all. Recognition of foreign marriages It is not uncommon for Australian citizens or Australian residents to go abroad to marry. This may be to the family‚Äôs ancestral home country, to a destination wedding location or because they would not be permitted to marry in Australia. However, if a party to the marriage is not an Australian citizen, issues may arise with plans for the couple to move to and live in Australia. Marriage by itself to a non-citizen does not, for example, guarantee an Australian visa, let alone citizenship. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) can legalise signatures or seals that appear on Australian public documents (apostilles and authentications) and issues Certificates of No Impediment to Marriage (including witnessing the signature on the form). In general, marriages entered into abroad are normally recognised in Australia as valid if they are valid according to the laws of the country in which the marriage took place, except that a marriage is not recognised as valid in Australia if: * either person is still married, that is, if it is a polygamous marriage, * either person is not of marriageable age, * the parties are within a prohibited relationship, or * there was no real consent. So, for example, even though it may be legal for a person under the age of 18 to marry abroad, such a marriage will not be recognised as valid under Australian law, even when the underage partner turns 18. Marriages performed abroad do not require to be registered in Australia, and it is advisable that the couple obtain and retain the marriage certificate from the relevant authority in the country in which the marriage took place. Registration  It is compulsory for marriages entered into in Australia to be registered in the appropriate state or territory registry. In Australia, after the marriage ceremony, the marriage celebrant will send a certified copy of Notice to the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages of the state or territory in which the marriage took place. The Registrar uses the information in the Notice to register the marriage. A failure to register does not invalidate the marriage, but the registrar cannot issue a marriage certificate until the marriage is registered. Marriages entered into abroad do not need to be registered in Australia. Proof of marriage In Australia, the marriage celebrant will at the time of marriage prepare three copies of a certificate, one for forwarding to the appropriate state or territory registry, one for the couple and one retained by the celebrant. While legally valid as proof of marriage, the couple‚Äôs copy is not generally acceptable as an official document. The state or territory registrars will, on application by either spouse, issue a marriage certificate which is considered to be an acceptable and secure secondary identity document especially for the purposes of change of name, and needs to be obtained separately, for a fee, generally some time after the marriage. This document can be verified electronically by the Attorney-General of Australia's Document Verification Service. States and territories sometimes market commemorative marriage certificates, which generally have no official document status. Marriage certificates are generally not used in Australia, other than to prove change-of-name, and proof of marital status for probate purposes or in a divorce application. Some visa categories require a certificate (where a partner is to be associated with a primary applicant), however there are similar categories of partner visas that do not. In the case of foreign marriages, the foreign marriage certificate is normally adequate proof of marriage. History Signing the marriage register, 1945 In colonial New South Wales marriage was often an arrangement of convenience. For female convicts, marriage was a way of escaping incarceration. Land leases were denied to those who were unmarried. On the other hand, there was a significant gender imbalance in the colony. Until 1961, each Australian state and territory administered its own marriage laws. The Marriage Act 1961 (Cth) was the first federal law on the matter and set uniform Australia-wide rules for the recognition and solemnisation of marriages. In its current form, the Act recognises only monogamous (heterosexual or same-sex) marriages and does not recognise any other forms of union, such as traditional Aboriginal marriages polygamous marriages or concubinage. The Family Law Act 1975 (Cth) replaced the previous faults-based divorce system with a no-fault divorce system, requiring only a twelve-month period of separation. The 1970s saw a significant rise in the divorce rate in Australia. This change has been attributed to a change in social attitudes: having once been considered acceptable only if there were severe problems, divorce was now widely considered acceptable if it was the preference of the partners. In 2004, the Liberal Howard Government enacted the Marriage Amendment Act 2004 to expressly ban same-sex marriage in Australia. It defined marriage as \\"the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life\\". Until the enactment of the 2004 amendment, there was no definition in the 1961 Act of \\"marriage\\", and the common law definition used in the English case Hyde v Hyde (1866) was taken as applicable.Hyde v. Hyde and Woodmansee {L.R.} 1 P. & D. 130. The definition pronounced by Lord Penzance in the case was: \\"I conceive that marriage, as understood in Christendom, may for this purpose be defined as the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others\\".Hyde v Hyde casenote . The 2004 amendment also banned the recognition of same-sex marriages performed in a foreign country.The 2004 Amendment inserted 88EA \\"Certain unions are not marriages\\" into the 1961 Act. The definition of marriage was added to the wedding ceremony speeches as a monitum; without it, ceremonies would be considered invalid. In 2009, the Labor Rudd Government enacted the Family Law Act 2009, which recognised the property rights of each partner of a de facto relationship, including a same-sex relationship, for the purposes of the Family Law Act 1975. The 2014 Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Act amended the Marriage Act 1961 in relation to celebrants and other issues.https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2014A00025 The 2017 Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act again changed the definition of \\"marriage\\" under the Marriage Act 1961, replacing the words \\"a man and a woman\\" with \\"2 people\\" and therefore allowing monogamous same-sex marriages. The Act also reversed the 2004 Amendment and retrospectively recognised same- sex marriages performed in a foreign country, provided that such marriages were permitted under the laws of that foreign country. Social change In 2009, the Australian Bureau of Statistics noted that \\"The proportion of adults living with a partner has declined during the last two decades, from 65% in 1986, to 61% in 2006\\". The proportion of Australians who are married fell from 62% to 52% over the same period.http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4102.0Main+Features20March%202009 Common-law marriages have increased significantly in recent decades, from 4% to 9% between 1986 and 2006. Cohabitation is often a prelude to marriage and reflects an increasing desire to attain financial independence before having children. In 2015, 81% of all those marrying were already living together.http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/3310.0 Civil celebrants have conducted the majority of marriages since 1999. In 2018, they conducted 79.7% of marriages. On its inception, the Commonwealth Public Service placed a bar on the employment of married women, so that married women could only be employed as temporary staff. Any female employee was required to resign upon marrying. This bar restricted women's opportunities for promotion. After a long campaign the bar was lifted in 1966.http://timeline.awava.org.au/archives/264 In 1971, more than three quarters of women surveyed placed being a mother before their career. By 1991 this figure had dropped to one quarter. By the 1980s there was a clear trend towards delaying first marriage. In 1989, more than one woman in five had not married by the age of 30. Between 1990 and 2010, the median age at first marriage increased by more than three years for both women and men (from 24.3 years to 27.9 years for women, and from 26.5 years to 29.6 years for men). =Divorce in Australia= Marriage and divorce rates in Australia from 1901 to 2005 The crude divorce rate was 2.0 divorces per 1,000 estimated resident population in 2014 and 2015, down from 2.1 in 2013. The median duration from marriage to divorce in 2015 was 12.1 years. The median age at divorce was 45.3 years for men and 42.7 years for women. =Same-sex marriage= The Marriage Act 1961 was amended in December 2017 by the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017 to amend the definition of marriage and to recognise same-sex marriage in Australia whether entered into in Australia or abroad. The original Marriage Act did not include a definition of marriage, leaving it to the courts to apply the common law definition.The definition is found in Hyde v Hyde (1866) {L.R.} 1 P. & D. 130: \\"I conceive that marriage, as understood in Christendom, may for this purpose be defined as the voluntary union for life of one man and one woman, to the exclusion of all others\\". The Marriage Amendment Act 2004 defined, for the first time by statute, marriage as \\"the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life.\\" The 2004 Act also expressly declared same-sex marriages entered into abroad were not to be recognised in Australia. This was in response to a lesbian couple getting married in Canada and applying for their marriage to be recognised in Australia. Since 2009, same-sex couples were included in Australia's de facto relationship laws, unions which provide couples with most, though not all, of the same rights as married couples. Same-sex and opposite-sex de facto couples can continue to access domestic partnership registries in New South Wales, Tasmania, South Australia and Victoria. Civil partnerships/unions are performed in Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. Western Australia and the Northern Territory do not recognise civil unions, civil partnerships or a relationship register, but do recognise the unregistered cohabitation of de facto couples under their laws.

Saltpetre and copper exports collapsed. The World Economic Survey of the League of Nations declared Chile the worst affected nation by the depression. Such economic devastation worsened Chile‚Äôs economic prosperity, highlighted particularly in 1932 that exemplifies a rapid fall in exports, imports, GDP and the value of industrial production from pre-depression levels. Chiles exports dropped from US $279m in 1929 to US $35m in 1932,Thorp 2000, p. 332. which in real terms corresponds to 1/6 of export level in 1929.Thorp 2000, p. 64. In accordance to this time period, Chile‚Äôs imports fell from US $197m in 1929 to US $26m in 1932 (Thorp 1984, p.333). Similarly, real GDP dropped from 100 in 1929 to 67 in 1932,Thorp 2000, p. 334. contributed by the fall of the value of production from 100 in 1929 to 77 in 1932 alongside a rapid decrease in the average annual production that reached the equivalent to one quarter of 1929 levels in December of 1932.Thorp 2000, p. 335. Alongside a decrease in employment in the mining sector, in terms of GDP and productive activity, mining dropped to 26.3 in 1932 from 1929 levels of 100.Thorp 2000, p. 67. Chile‚Äôs economic struggles during the Depression were further compounded by a decrease of foreign loans. This contributed to an increase in Chile‚Äôs budget deficit and reduced government revenue, resultant of their heavy reliance on Foreign financial support, in particular US support, to drive Economic growth pre-depression. Whilst Chile in 1929 received a total of US $338 million of foreign loans, in 1932 they only received US 23 million.Thorp 2000, p. 65. In this same period, Chile‚Äôs budget deficit rose from 31% of total expenditure in 1931 to 37% in 1932. Political impact and response The crisis caused the authoritarian regime of Carlos Ib√°√±ez del Campo to fall in July 1931 followed by a succession of short-lived governments until the election of Arturo Alessandri in December 1932. The state responded to the crisis by gradually raising tariffs, increasing internal demand and increasing control over the \\"flux and use\\" of foreign currency.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 762-763.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 141-142. Quotas and licences were established for imports and the gold convertibility was once again abolished in 1931.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 767-768. These policies contributed to an industrial recovery and for the industry to already by 1934 surpass the levels of activity of 1929. In the 1930s the massive industrial growth was spearheaded by the textile industry, but non-metallic mining, chemical industries and machine and transport factories did also expand.Salazar & Pinto 2002, pp. 143-144. Overall industry recovered and expanded faster than the traditional exports in the post depression period. Migration, unemployment and social consequences Soup kitchen to feed the unemployed in 1932. During this period of the Great depression, Chile‚Äôs sluggish economic growth throughout 1929-1932 is further representative of the rising unemployment and decrease in the production of nitrate. A decrease in employment in Chile‚Äôs mining sector is exemplified from 1929 to 1932, in which the number of workers in 1932 stood at less than one third of 1929 figures of 91000.Thorp 2000, p. 66. More specifically, in the nitrate sector alone 50,000 workers were unemployed by 1932Drinot & Knight 2014, p. 10. High rates of unemployment, caused by a fragile export economy saw an increase in geographical mobility of the working class, exemplified between September 1930 to February in 1931 where 46,459 people left nitrate fields to the main cities of Chile, such as Santiago and other provincial cities.Drinot & Knight 2014, p. 56. Miners constituted around 6% of the active population but made up more than half of the unemployed during the crisis. Numerous soup kitchens sprang up in Santiago while homeless people begun to dwell in caves in the hills around Santiago. Thus, the working class was primarily subject to the social consequences, such as poverty, created by this rise in unemployment and deterioration of mining exports, in particular nitrate, during the Depression. Working class struggle combined with economic decline lead to the printing of more money by Chile‚Äôs president Juan Antonio Montero in April 1932.Drinot & Knight 2014, p. 67. This allowed the government to pay $152 million pesos towards government expenses, public works and public aid for the unemployed. References Bibliography *Drinot, Paulo & Knight Alan (2014).

Geography  The village is situated to the south of Sierra de la Culebra, next to the Portuguese border. The town is crossed by the river Fontano, also known as Comtessa or River Onor in its Portuguese stretch. It is 14 km from Puebla de Sanabria, 21 km from Pedralba de la Prader√≠a, and 22 km from Bragan√ßa.  Demography  The number of inhabitants has been waning slowly since the mid-20th century. In 2007, there were only 16 inhabitants in the village according to the Spanish Statistics National Institute. The beauty of the village and its landscapes, the traditions, and the enormous possibilities of development have attracted people wishing to settle in the village.  Society  The main source of income has traditionally been commerce, since it is situated in the border between Spain and Portugal. At present, the economy is subsistence economy, because most plots of land are abandoned and most of its inhabitants are retired people. There is a grocery store providing the locals whereas the rest of traders come from Portugal in their vehicles in order to sell their products. The village has a unique special peculiarity in the Iberian peninsula: actually, both the Portuguese village Rio de Onor and the Spanish village Rihonor de Castilla form only one village artificially divided by the borderline. For this reason, the inhabitants of these villages speak both Spanish and Portuguese influenced by the autochthonous language known as rihonor√©s, a dialect of the Leonese language.

It is located at the corner of Front Street and Cherry Street in the West Don Lands neighbourhood. The building served as the Toronto headquarters for the Canadian National Railways (CNR) police. It is one of two preserved buildings on Cherry Street that weren't demolished to make way for a new housing development, the other being the Cherry Street Hotel, across the street on the southeast corner. On April 14, 2005, the City of Toronto Council approved the listing of the property on the City of Toronto Heritage Property Inventory. The building is in the West Don Lands redevelopment, which hosted the 2015 Pan American Games Athletes' Village and is currently under development. The area was initially cleared for the \\"Ataratiri\\" urban renewal project in the 1990s that failed. Several buildings such as the Railway Police Building, were identified as suitable for reuse and kept. As part of the bid for the 2015 Pan American Games, Toronto promised to rebuild the area, using apartment towers for the Athletes' Village, which would then be converted to condominiums. The area's condominium towers are slated to become the Canary District development, and in 2014, the Railway Police Building hosted the Canary District sales and presentation office. History The building was built in 1923 by Canadian National Railways (CNR) after the Government of Canada merged five railway companies into CNR. The building was used as office space and then used by the Canadian National Police Service. To the east of the building was attached a freight yard transfer facility with doors along Front Street. The freight yard tracks themselves were taken up in 1970. The building has since been used as a location for film shoots as a 1920s vintage building. As part of the West Don Lands redevelopment, the building was selected to be kept as a heritage building. For the 2015 Pan American Games, two buildings were built next to the building, a YMCA and a college residence. Both buildings were used as accommodations during the 2015 Games.

The film is directed by Itsumichi Isomura and stars Kumiko Takeda, Kazuya Takahashi and Natsue Yoshimura. It was released in theaters on July 13, 1996 in Japan. The movie was released in North American on subtitled only VHS on November 23, 1998 and then on DVD on January 13, 2004 by Central Park Media under their Asia Pulp Cinema label. Plot Amane (Kazuya Takahashi) is a regular office worker who is bored with life. His girlfriend Juri (Natsue Yoshimura) pressures him to put their relationship to the next level. However, he is uncomfortable in the relationship. One day, as he is driving, he hits a woman who was walking on the road. She is taken to the hospital where she eventually recovers. Guilty of what he's done, Amane tells her to let him repay her for the accident, but she declines and disappears from the hospital. Obsessed since their encounter, he finally finds her one night at a nightclub and learns that her name is Hanabusa. He also learns that the nightclub has transvestites and that Hanabusa (Kumiko Takeda) is a hermaphrodite. Amane is disgusted at first, but goes along with her for the rest of the night. After that night Amane longs to see Hanabusa and they have sex one night. Hanabusa shows Amane on how to be the perfect partner in sex both on top and bottom. Satisfied with this, Amane breaks up with Juri and both Hanabusa and Amane fall in love. Juri is upset and tries to confront Hanabusa, but ends up sleeping with her through the night. The next morning, Juri (while having enjoyed that she slept with Hanabusa) is even more angry at Amane and has sex with one of his co-workers, Takayanagi (Kunihiko Ida). Meanwhile, Amane and Hanabusa drive to Amane's hometown and Amane purposes that Hanabusa should meet his family. However, Hanabusa refuses and tells him to pull over. Amane is confused by this and states that he want to further their relationship. Hanabusa does not want to and suggests that they should break up. Amane confronts her and angrily states that there is no place for someone like her. She responds by telling him to run over her again. They sit silently in the car, as Amane is trying to start the car. But he is angry and tells Hanabusa that he is lonely and desperately in love with her. Hanabusa still suggests they should just end their relationship. Later, Takayanagi reveals to Amane that he slept with Juri half-way and suggests that he and Juri reconcile. But Amane tells him that he is better off not seeing her or Hanabusa. But in reality, he is more depressed and alone. The next morning, Hanabusa is walking and finds Amane sitting in the snow. He gives back the heel from one of her shoes and leaves. But Hanabusa stops him and realizes that they should be lovers and mend their relationship. Meanwhile, Juri finds out that her period is late and uses this as a way to get back together with Amane and tries to push him into marrying her. However, Amane and Hanabusa believes she is lying, which makes her upset and she leaves. She later leaves a message on his voice- mail, threatening to commit suicide by drug overdose, blaming Amane for leaving her and pleading to him to come back to her one more time. The last scene in the film is Hanabusa and Amane visiting a now comatose Juri in the hospital. Amane says that this is the end, while Hanabusa remarks that it is not the end, but just the beginning.

Prior to it, he also discovered a tusk and a jaw of a mastodon in 1871 in Mission San Jose, which was measured to be 24 inches and was the most complete jaw ever discovered in the state of California. He sent the jaw to Yale College for examination and collected more elephant fossils which he found below the surface in 1872 which were examined at the Wabash College.

Description This infrequently visited wilderness is composed of second and third growth oak-hickory forest with intermittent portions of shortleaf pine. Richland Creek and Long Devil's Fork Creek intersect within the area, both are surrounded by steep sandstone bluffs. The area was formerly used for logging, and many trails consist of former logging roads. Black bears are known to inhabit the wilderness, along with White-tailed deer, wild turkey, skunks, opossums, minks and pheasants.

It is the largest flying, ball- rolling dung beetle in the world. The front legs, that it walks on while rolling the dung ball, are particularly strong. It specializes to some extent on buffalo and elephant dung and constructs a large ball, with the flattened leg appendages. The front legs have a rufous velvet patch each, that are used to wipe the eyes clean. The eyes are oriented to provide a good downward view while flying. The dung ball is rolled away from their con-specific competitors and buried in the ground. The male forms the dung ball for breeding, and a female will approach and assist in rolling a dung ball which is to her liking.Erik Holm, Projek Aardwolf, Episode 30 References Category:Beetles described in 1828 ","title":"Pachylomera femoralis"},{"id":"40140450","text":"Donald B.

It was eventually suppressed by the Armenian government on May 14 and its leaders were executed. Monument to the participants of May Uprising in Gyumri. Although the revolt failed, Armenia was Sovietized after the Red Army invaded the country in November 1920 and Turks occupied the western half of Armenia. The revolt and its executed leaders were praised during the Soviet period from 1920 until the late 1980s, when the Karabakh movement began and anti-Soviet sentiment arose in Armenia. The revolt remains a controversial topic in Armenia. Background Since the establishment of the Republic of Armenia in 1918, the political parties and different factions, for the most part, avoided internal conflicts or rebellions against the dominant Dashnak party since the country was in deep economic and demographic crisis and was at some point during its two-year existence at war with three of its four neighbors (Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia). This changed after by the advancement of the Bolsheviks into the Caucasus region in early 1920. The Armenian Communist Party, operating secretly, was founded in January 1920 to fight against the \\"vilifying the Allied Powers and their Dashnakist 'collaborators'.\\" The revolt Encouraged by the Red Army invasion of Azerbaijan in late April 1920, the Bolsheviks in Armenia staged a revolt in May. The events preceding the revolt started on May 1, 1920, International Workers' Day, with the Bolsheviks demonstrating against the government of Armenia in capital Yerevan and other cities. The revolt escalated after the armored train named \\"Vardan zoravar\\" under command of Sargis Musayelyan joined the Bolshevik rebels who had formed a revolutionary committee (Revkom) and proclaimed Armenia a Soviet state in Alexandopol on May 10.National Republic, Volumes 21-22, 1933, p. 84 \\"A republic had been declared in 1918, and on May 10, 1920, a \\"Soviet Republic\\" acclaimed.

Kadishev, Interventsia I Grazhdanskaja Vojna v Zakavkazje (Moscow, 1961), pp. 280-289 On May 5, 1920, the government (the cabinet) of Alexander Khatisian resigned and new one was formed under Hamo Ohanjanyan's leadership. It was entirely made up of Dashnak party members. The parliament gave up its rights to the government since Armenia was under state of emergency. Sebouh Nersesian was appointed commander to suppress the revolt. On May 13 his unit reached Alexandropol and by the next day the rebels left the city and the government forces entered the city and established order. Aftermath The leaders of the revolt, including Sargis Musayelyan and Ghukas Ghukasyan, were executed by court decisions. The Communist party of Armenia was banned in Armenia. Armenia's domestic situation was badly hurt and the Turkish‚ÄìArmenian War broke out on September 24. After three months, the Treaty of Alexandropol was signed on December 3, effectively dividing Armenia between Turkey and the Russians. A new government in the remainder of independent Armenia then cleared the way for a new government that accomplished the purpose sought in the uprising.

The central square of Armenia's second largest city Gyumri (called Leninakan during the Soviet period) was called after the revolt. It is now called Vardanants Square. =Independent Armenia= The revolt remains a somewhat controversial topic even in post-Soviet Armenia. According to a study of Armenian school textbooks \\"the tone of the account remains fairly restrained and neutral, a certain interpretation of the events is not imposed on the students.\\" The use of the term \\"uprising\\" in these textbooks, however--as opposed to \\"rebellion\\", as with contemporary instances of Muslim unrest--betrays a slight sympathy towards the Bolsheviks.

The service began on December 12, 1948 as the Steeler, a single round-trip between Pittsburgh and Cleveland. It departed Cleveland in the morning and returned from Pittsburgh in the late afternoon. Its travel time of 2 hours and 40 minutes was, at the time, the fastest between the two cities. At first the Steeler made just two intermediate stops, in Alliance and Hudson, Ohio. On April 30, 1950, the Pennsylvania inaugurated a second round-trip between the two cities, adding a morning departure from Pittsburgh and a corresponding afternoon return from Cleveland. The morning pair were dubbed the Morning Steeler and the afternoon pair the Afternoon Steeler. Pittsburgh Steelers head coach John Michelosen was on hand to christen the new service. Prior to this the Pennsylvania had five daily round-trips between the two cities: the Steeler, Clevelander, and three additional unnamed pairs. The Steeler carried both a parlor and a \\"dining lounge\\" car in addition to coaches. The Pennsylvania discontinued the Morning Steeler on September 7, 1957. The railroad cited competition from the newly completed Ohio Turnpike; daily patronage had fallen to 35 and yearly losses totaled $41,000. Its discontinuance left two Pennsylvania trains, the Afternoon Steeler and the Clevelander, between Pittsburgh and Cleveland. The Afternoon Steeler survived another year, ending on June 28, 1958.

It was named for the short-lived World Football League which served as a competitor to the NFL in the mid-1970s. History In 2007, the rights to the \\"World Football League\\" name and logo were purchased by Chip Pierce of Beaumont, Texas. The league was brought back to life as a minor league system that did not compete with the NFL, but gave players of a higher talent level than that of the many players involved in semi-pro football the opportunity to showcase their skills. Players like Willie Ponder who have exited the NFL but had aspirations of returning and players like Kejuan Jones or Prentiss Elliot who were looking to get a shot to make in the NFL. At the end of the season SiteInDeX, Inc., purchased the WFL from Pierce. Play The inaugural rebirth season of the WFL as a minor league system had 6 teams in Texas, Arkansas, and Oklahoma. World Bowl II (continuing the number from the original league) was held at Independence Stadium in Shreveport, Louisiana. The World Bowl matched the Oklahoma Thunder against the Austin Gamebreakers. The Thunder prevailed making them the first champion of the WFL in the minor league era. The Thunder also won WFL's World Bowl III (vs. Dallas Diesel) in 2009 and defeated the Des Moines Blaze in the World Bowl IV on July 31, 2010, in Tulsa. The Thunder won all 40 of their games in WFL history. End Before the 2011 season, most of the teams in the new WFL either folded or left for other leagues. In a key defection, three-time World Bowl winner Oklahoma Thunder left for the much larger Gridiron Developmental Football League.The new WFL merged with another league to become the Alliance Football League. The merged league began the 2011 season with six teams: the Texas Bulldogs, Dallas-Fort Worth Heat, Dallas Diesel, Central Texas Gorillas, Houston Pride of Texas, and Oklahoma City Wolverines. World Bowl V, scheduled for Tulsa, was moved to Shreveport, Louisiana, and renamed the National Championship. This merger and renaming ended the minor league rebirth of the WFL.

She fought primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for Sagittaria, which is an aquatic water plant that is sometimes known as Arrowhead. Background Flower-class corvettes like Arrowhead serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Construction Ordered 22 January 1940 under the 1939-40 Flower class program by the Royal Navy from Marine Industries Ltd. in Sorel, Quebec Arrowhead was laid down 11 April 1940. She was launched on 8 August 1940 and commissioned 22 November later that year. On the 15 May 1941 she was one of ten corvettes loaned to Canada. She could be told apart from other Canadian Flower class vessels by her lack of minesweeping gear and the siting of the after gun tub amidships. War service =Royal Navy= After commissioning Arrowhead sailed to Sunderland to fully fit out which took two months. She worked up at Tobermory and joined EG-4 of Iceland Command. =Royal Canadian Navy= In June 1941, after commissioning in the RCN, Arrowhead joined Newfoundland Force and spent the majority of 1941 escorting convoys from St. John's to Iceland. In late December, Arrowhead was sent to Charleston for a refit. She returned to Halifax in February 1942 and did one more cross-Atlantic convoy before being reassigned to Western Local Escort Force (WLEF). In July she joined the Gulf Escort Force and participated in the Battle of the St. Lawrence. Arrowhead spent the final months of 1942 bouncing around commands, joining Halifax Force in October, and returning to WLEF at the end of November. She stayed with WLEF until August 1944. In June 1943, when WLEF introduced dedicated escort groups, Arrowhead was first assigned to group W-7 before transferring to W-1 in December. During her period with WLEF, Arrowhead had two major refits, one in Charleston in the spring of 1943 and one in Baltimore in May 1944 where her fo'c'sle was extended. After returning to service she was assigned to Quebec- Labrador convoys in September 1944. In December of that year, Arrowhead was reassigned to Western Escort Force's Escort Group W-8 and used on the \\"Triangle Run\\" between Boston/New York, Halifax and St. John's until May 1945. Arrowhead was assigned to convoy HX 358 with three other loaned corvettes, , and . After arrival at Milford Haven, on 27 June 1945 she was paid off and returned to the Royal Navy. Post-war career In 1947 Arrowhead was sold for conversion to a whale-catcher with a gross register tonnage of 757 tons, emerging in 1948. She was renamed Southern Larkspur. Eventually, the vessel was broken up at Odense, Denmark in December 1959 by H.I. Hansen.

Plot At her Marie Antoinette-themed birthday bash, Michelle loses her head after a few drinks and wakes up dishevelled in a hotel room. Forty days later, she discovers she‚Äôs pregnant and sets about finding the culprit. Michelle narrows it down to three suspects who turned up at her shindig: figure-skating teenager Jeb (Jiang Jingfu); seafood-sauce tycoon Tiger (Leon Lai); and her Harvard-educated Chinese-American boss, Bill (Daniel Henney). Their confrontations provide ample opportunities for overdone slapstick and naughty sexual innuendo, but there‚Äôs also the matter of her incompatibility with any of them, poignantly addressing the harsh reality that she‚Äôs not exactly long-term relationship material in their eyes. Michelle is sure Bill is the baby's father. Her assistant, Tony Zhang, tries to explain to her that Bill doesn't really love her after they go out to dinner and see Bill eating with his new girlfriend. They end up having a fight, and Tony unexpectedly quits the job at the company, most likely either because he is irritated at Michelle or he doesn't want to annoy her anymore. However, Michelle ends up realizing that Tony is an important part of her life, and is upset when he didn't appear to see her. Tony suddenly decides to go to Africa to photograph animals. He gives Michelle Daisy Jo (her cat) and a turtle. Michelle quits the job at the company and moves to Malaysia and opens her own shop, Michelle's Surprises. Tony comes to see her and reveals he is the one that got her pregnant. Michelle screams because her water broke. Tony proposes.

In addition, Fan, the director, Aarif, and Jiang Jinfu also involved in some variety shows and media interviews for the promotion. Reception =Box office= As of 25 August, the film has grossed more than $26,930,000, and this is a huge financial success, compared with the budget less than $3 million. =Critical reception= This film received positive reviews. The Los Angeles Times wrote that \\"though Jin set One Night Surprise in Beijing, it's a sexy, cosmopolitan tale whose bilingual characters could just as easily be going to clubs with pole dancers and driving their Mercedes-Benzes in Seoul, Paris or L.A.\\" Variety said this film was a \\"remixing ideas from dude-centric Hollywood laffers like The Hangover and Knocked Up, but retooled for China‚Äôs distaff demographic, this date movie is at once sweetly whimsical and full of ballsy sexual wisecracks.

He was one of the first archaeologists to explore the prominent burial mounds in the area of the Persian Gulf, and he made some very important discoveries. He also worked for the British East India Company. Family He was the son of Captain (later Colonel) R. Taylor, who was the British Assistant Political Agent in Basra from 1818 to 1822.British Museum site biography of John George Taylor Colonel R. Taylor may have been the one who originally acquired the famous Taylor prism in 1830. It was purchased from Colonel Taylor's widow in 1850 by the British Museum. Career One of Taylor's sketches, of the ancient fortress of Arzen, from his Travels in Kurdistan (1865) John Taylor was appointed as Agent for the British East India Company, and the British Vice- Consul at Basra from 1851 to 1858. He was also British Consul-General for Kurdistan, alternately residing at Diyarbakir and Erzurum starting in 1859. He travelled extensively in his consular area and published some of his travel reports in the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. In 1866, he was one of the first foreigners to penetrate in the Dersim area. His report on this journey ( \\"Journal of a tour in Armenia, Kurdistan and Upper Mesopotamia, with Notes of Researches in the Deyrsim Dagh\\") retains importance to this date as one of the earliest sources of the history, geography and anthropology of this area. Archaeology Taylor worked in Iraq under the supervision of Henry Rawlinson, also known as 'the Father of Assyriology'. =Excavations at Ur= After a visit by William Kennett Loftus to the site of Ur, Taylor began excavations there in 1853, and continued in 1854.J. E.

In the relevant publications he is erroneously listed as J. E. Taylor.E. Sollberger, Mr. Taylor in Chaldaea, Anatolian Studies, vol. 22, pp. 129‚Äì139 , 1972 He worked on behalf of the British Museum. Taylor found clay cylinders in the four corners of the top stage of the ziggurat which bore an inscription of Nabonidus (Nabuna'id), the last king of Babylon (539 BC), closing with a prayer for his son Belshar-uzur (Bel- ≈ùarra-Uzur), the Belshazzar of the Book of Daniel. These were the Ur Cylinders of Nabonidus. Evidence was found of prior restorations of the ziggurat by Ishme-Dagan of Isin, also later by Shu-Sin of Ur, and still later by Kurigalzu, a Kassite king of Babylon in the 14th century BCE. All about the city, Taylor also found abundant remains of burials of later periods. In 1855, Taylor also excavated at Abu Shahrain (Eridu) and at Tell al-Lahm (Kuara). In 1861 he explored at Kurkh near Diyarbekir, where he discovered the stela of Ashurnasirpal II (now located at the British Museum as ME 118883). The location of 'Kurkh near Diyarbekir' is not entirely certain, but it may be the site of the ancient Tushhan, near the modern town of Bismil in Turkey.Nadav Na ºaman, Ancient Israel and Its Neighbors: Interaction and Counteraction : Collected Essays, Eisenbrauns, 2005. p. 2 Also, 'Kurkh' may have been the nearby town of √ú√ßtepe, in the district of Bismil. In 1861, at Kurkh, he also discovered the stela of Shalmaneser III (ME 118884). This is the famous Kurkh Monolith, an Assyrian monument that contains a description of the Battle of Qarqar. Today it is located at the British Museum. Taylor received a commission from the British Museum to conduct his excavations in these areas. Publications He first published the results of his southern Iraqi excavations in the 'Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society' for 1855; unfortunately, this item appeared under the incorrect name of 'J.E. Taylor'. This mistaken attribution was repeated in several other publications later on.

Rotodynamic pumps are generally unsuitable for dispensing laboratory media.  List of media dispensers  =Floating Piston= The floating piston type includes electrically and manually operated subtypes. Both include a check valve at either end of the device to ensure the flow of fluids in only one direction. Sterile media dispenser with electromagnetic inductive pump manufactured by 150px Inductive pump The electrical floating piston type of media dispenser is based on the principle of an inductive pump. This design uses a floating piston housed inside of a cylinder (typically high-grade ferromagnetic stainless steel) and vibrated according to a magnetic pulse generated by a copper coil inside the cylinder and surrounding the piston. Oscillation of the piston back and forth in the cylinder causes aspiration of fluid into the cylinder at one end followed by ejection from the other end. 95px Bottle top A bottle top media dispensers is an inexpensive alternative to the motor-driven inductive pump. This type involves a piston on a plunger which is pushed down against a spring: as the spring pushes the piston back into its original position, it draws the medium up from a reservoir underneath. When pushed down again, plunger infuses the medium out the dispenser tip. Like the electrical model mentioned above, the bottle top dispenser has no gaskets or seals. Unlike the previous model, this one requires no electricity. However, it is limited in the total amount of medium it can dispense before the source bottle requires a refill, making it convenient for small applications but less so for larger. They are also more difficult to calibrate than the pipettes. 150px Solid Media Dispenser A dispenser that is capable of dispensing solids such as powders, resins, microbeads, beads etc. It uses a metal plate containing holes to hold a specific amount of solid material to be dispensed. After the holes are filled with 'powder', a slider is pulled that opens the holes also called the 'dropdown method', letting the powder drop into a tube, well or microtiterplate. As this device is very accurate, it is widely used in laboratories and in the pharmaceutical industry. =Syringe pump= A syringe pump consists of one or more syringes which have been pre-filled and loaded into a mechanized device containing a motor-driven lead screw which will push the reciprocating plunger of the syringe(s) for specified distances at specified intervals. These devices are capable of extremely high accuracy and are pulse-free (i.e., the fluid is dispensed in a continuous stream rather than with the pulsations of the peristaltic or inductive pumps) but are limited in volume to the total volume of the attached syringe(s), and, once the emptied, the syringe(s) will require refilling before being used again making them of even more limited use than the bottle top dispensers. They are also among the most expensive types of media dispensers currently on the market. Common syringe pump media are acids, chemicals, coolants, combustible fluids, corrosive agents, gasoline or diesel fuel, non-liquid gas or air, ground water, hazardous materials, high viscosity fluids, liquid metal, oils, potable water, salt water, adhesives, and high temperature media. A peristaltic pump Types of pressure syringe pump can vary depending on the company: * Low Pressure (290N): This syringe pump suitable for high precise dosage of small volumes (nanolitres). * Mid Pressure (1000N): This syringe pumps are made for the precise injection of fluids into systems under higher pressures (200 bar) * High Pressure (2600N): This work the same as mid pressure bar, but dosing technology pressure can be ranges up to 510 bar. * Ultra High Pressure (7000N): This Ultra high pressure is suitable for extreme conditions in terms of high pressures (up to 13000 psi) =Peristaltic pump= Despite their drawbacks, peristaltic pumps have so far been the industry standard for dispensing large volumes of laboratory media: they are capable of dispensing fluid continuously from a reservoir into any number of receptacles, can be used for coarse, thick, or gritty fluids as well as free-flowing thin ones, and unlike many of the other dispenser types, the only contact the pumped fluid has during delivery is with the tubing in which it is being transported: there is never any contact with an internal piston, plunger, or diaphragm, which ensures the highest degrees of sterility and precludes virtually any chemical cross contamination. However, their functionality is limited to the flexible lifetime of this tubing which must be able to withstand hundreds of thousands of compressions without losing integrity; their fluid delivery is pulsed; variation in the flexibility of the tubing means they are among the least precise forms of dispenser; the tubing in a peristaltic pump may rupture unexpectedly‚Äî many pumps include shielding to help contain the ruptured fluids, but a rupture can ruin a carefully timed lab procedure and/ or damage the inner workings of the pump itself; few other pump types are more dependent on a microprocessor or more useless in the event of mechanical failure; they along with syringe pumps constitute the most expensive dispensers on the market. 100px =Pipette= A pipette consists of a long thin tubular tip connected to a hollow cylinder containing a plunger. Pipettes are the simplest, smallest, and in their basic forms, the least expensive type of media dispenser, and are also pulse-free. However, they can only effectively transport one or two fills at a time, and, unless filled from the rear, the tube tip must constantly be reinserted into the source vessel in order to be refilled which creates a repeated opportunity for contamination. They also require the user to do more work than any other type of dispenser both in terms of time to fill a receptacle and energy necessary to make sure each fill is precise and accurate (digital pipette models may work faster and require less work per fill from the user than manual ones, though these are then subject to the availability of electricity and the possibility of mechanical failure). On the plus side, the simple pipette has few moving parts, rarely or never breaks down, and is capable of moving thick or thin media including those containing abrasives with relative ease. =Pressure injection cell= A pressure injection cell dispenser is capable of administering only the very smallest amounts of extremely pure non-viscous media, though it does so with the absolutely highest degree of precision. The cells in this dispenser, which are usually between 0.5 ml and 2 ml in capacity, must be individually filled using a centrifuge before being inserted into the dispenser. Once loaded, the amount of fluid dispensed will depend on the pressure of an inert gas such as helium or nitrogen released from a tank and pushed against the cells at pressures of up to . The pressure injection cell is considered a \\"dynamic\\" pump type rather than a \\"displacement\\" type because it achieves movement of liquids by exerting force on them directly with no moving parts.

Background The fight was a matchup between two undefeated, up-and-coming heavyweights. Thirty-year-old 1988 Olympic Gold Medalist Ray Mercer had won all 17 of his previous fights (12 by KO) since turning pro in 1989 and was coming off a victory over Francesco Damiani that made him the WBO Heavyweight Champion, though the WBO title did not carry nearly as much prestige as the WBA, WBC and IBF versions of the title. Meanwhile, 22-year-old Tommy Morrison was a perfect 28‚Äì0 with 23 victories coming by way of knockout. Morrison had four prior fights in 1991 including first round victories over former heavyweight contenders James Tillis and Pinklon Thomas. Initially, the bout was set to take place on August 9, but Morrison had to withdraw after suffering a deep cut while sparring.Fight Is Off, N.Y. Times article, 1991-07-20, Retrieved on 2013-08-03 Mercer contemplated facing a substitute opponent, but it was announced the following week that fight would be rescheduled for October 18.Bout Is Rescheduled, N.Y. Times article, 1991-07-28, Retrieved on 2013-08-03https://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Ray_Mercer_vs._Tommy_Morrison While Mercer was fighting and winning with injuries and under adversity against Kimmuel Odum, Bert Cooper and Francesco Damiani, critics have called his skills primitive. Rumors circulated that Ray was more dedicated to partying than to training. The Fight Morrison got off to a great start, outboxing a sluggish Mercer through the first three rounds en route to taking all three rounds on all three of the judge's scorecards. Morrison was able to limit Mercer's offense, landed several combinations and opened up a cut on Mercer's lower lip. However, Mercer rebounded with a strong round four, landing several hard rights to Morrison's head. Mercer would end the fight only 28 seconds into the fifth round. With Morrison backed up into the corner, Mercer was able to land a 15‚Äìpunch combination. Clearly hurt from the exchange, Morrison slumped against the ropes, but the referee allowed Mercer to land several more punishing blows to a now defenseless Morrison before finally ending the fight.Rocky VI: The Pummeling, Sports Illustrated article, 1991-10-28, Retrieved on 2013-08-03 Aftermath Mercer's victory propelled into one of the top heavyweights in the division and he made it known in his post-match interview that he wanted a shot at Evander Holyfield's Undisputed Heavyweight title. Mercer chose to bypass a WBO title match with Michael Moorer, instead vacating the title in order to move on to a number one contenders match with Larry Holmes scheduled on February 7, 1992 with a shot at Holyfield's Undisputed title on the line. Mercer was installed as a heavy favorite over the aging Holmes, but Holmes was able to outbox and outpoint Mercer en route to a unanimous decision victory, taking Mercer's title shot against Holyfield in the process. Morrison rebounded from the loss by winning his next eight fights before meeting George Foreman for the WBO Heavweight Championship in June 1993, which had been vacated by Moorer earlier in the year. Morrison was able to outbox Foreman and won by a lopsided unanimous decision to become the new WBO champion, as well as reestablishing him as one of the top heavyweight contenders. He then signed a deal to meet the WBC Heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis for the title, but chose to take a tuneup bout against the virtually unknown Michael Bentt before facing Lewis. The decision would prove to be unwise as Bentt brutalized Morrison during their fight, knocking him down three times in the first after which the fight was stopped and Bentt was named the winner. The loss cost Morrison his title shot against Lewis, as well as a reported $7.5 million that he was to earn in the Lewis fight.

Marine biologists Lisa-Ann Gershwin and Peter Davie described the jellyfish in June 2013, from the holotype, which was collected in shallow water in the Brunswick River in northern New South Wales at high tide. The specific epithet refers to Denis Riek, who photographed a specimen in northern New South Wales, leading to the discovery. Bazinga rieki could not be placed in any known family or suborder of rhizostome jellyfish, so a new family Bazingidae was erected; it represents a new sub order of Rhizostomae, called Ptychophorae. Bazinga rieki has a thick round translucent and colourless body, the aboral (upper) surface of which is covered in tiny warts with yellow centres. The subumbrellar muscle folds are golden brown, their colour derived from zooxanthellae. With a diameter of less than , around the size of a grape, it is much smaller than any other rhizostome. It has a large circular stomach that takes up over half the jellyfish's body and is visible from underneath. It has a hooded rhopalia rather than open pits, unlike any other rhizostome. The genus name, Bazinga, has two cultural references: firstly, as a colloquialism meaning \\"fooled you!\\" uttered by Dr. Sheldon Cooper in the television program The Big Bang Theory, as the small size means the species was probably mistaken as a juvenile of other species, such as the similar Catostylus mosaicus; the term bazinga is also given to a seven string harp, and the straight radial canals of this new species are reminiscent of such strings.

They lived relatively short lives amongst NZR ten wheelers, mostly at the southern end of the country where they were seldom photographed. Origin and design As New Zealand rapidly recovered from the 1880s depression, NZR developed a motive power shortage that its own workshops could not keep up with. After his 1898 annual report indicated it was \\"absolutely necessary\\" to obtain more locomotives the Locomotive Superintendent obtained permission to buy sixteen 4-6-0 locomotives, ten from Baldwin, and six from Sharp Stewart and Co. All were delivered in 1899. Unlike the Addington U class the new locomotives were of uniform appearance, with low mounted running boards and splashers over the drivers. The design was based on and very similar to the U class, differing primarily in the provision of smaller driving wheels delivering higher tractive effort. Although they used the same type of boiler they carried a higher pressure and were fitted with piston valves. Overall their appearance was similar to their predecessors. Service Initially three each were stationed at Invercargill and Dunedin to run express passenger services between those cities. Later the Dunedin-based engines joined their siblings in the south. The only know report from footplate men indicated that while finely built they were difficult to fire. However annual returns indicate that they ran greater annual miles and at lower cost than other 4-6-0's at the time. Modifications included lengthening the smokebox, a common procedure on many early NZR types, and sand domes were provided, while the running boards were raised. In the 1920s either two or three (sources vary) received superheated boilers of 200 lb sq in working pressure. However, the class was gone before the end of the 1930s, the superheated boilers going to members of the UC class of the same maker. One was reportedly dumped on the Oamaru foreshore.

The film stars Elijah Wood, Sasha Grey and Neil Maskell, and had its world premiere at South by Southwest on 10 March 2014. It is Vigalondo's first English-language film. Plot Nick Chambers wins a contest to meet his favorite actress, Jill Goddard. Nick, the webmaster of a fansite dedicated to Jill, is crushed when Chord, Jill's manager, informs him that she has not only failed to invite him to the film's publicity event but also canceled the contest. Chord remotely sends Nick a link to his laptop that opens a live stream. Chord explains that he has hacked into Jill's cell phone and activated the microphone and camera without her knowledge. Although uneasy about invading her privacy, Nick goes along with Chord's plans to spy on her. By eavesdropping on her phone conversations, they learn that she will secretly meet her agent, Tony, with whom she is having an affair, at the same hotel in which Nick is staying. Chord directs Nick to use preexisting high-end surveillance equipment to spy on Jill and Tony. As he watches them, Nick is briefly contacted by a trio of hackers who address him as Nevada. Jill leaves Tony's room. When Nick's lights spontaneously turn on and Tony can see the camera pointed at his room, Nick panics as Tony leaves his room to investigate. Chord orders Nick to use a Taser to incapacitate Tony. Feeling that he has no choice, Nick agrees. Nick initially refuses to tie up Tony but does so once Chord threatens to stop helping him. Suspicious of why all this equipment is available in his hotel room, Nick questions who Chord really is; Chord ignores him and guides him out of the hotel by hacking into its security system. Chord blackmails Nick into further compliance by revealing that the entire contest was a hoax, and Chord now has video proof of Nick's crimes. Chord forces Nick to follow Jill to her house, and he is contacted once again by the trio of hackers who believe Nick to be a famous hacker. They offer to help him in his latest hack and Nick recruits them to counteract Chord. Meanwhile, Chord hacks into Jill's PC when she goes home. When Nick refuses to send her PC a file, Chord demonstrates that he is capable of sneaking into Jill's house and killing her. The file turns out to be a live feed of Tony's torture by electric current. Horrified, Nick attempts to bargain with Chord for Tony's release, but Chord only tortures Tony further. Chord forces Nick to give commands to Jill through her PC, and Nick demands that she reveal her breasts. Satisfied with the resulting video, Chord breaks the connection. Nick frantically attempts to warn Jill but she is kidnapped by Chord. With the help of the hackers, Nick pursues Chord. However, once they realize that Chord is actually the master hacker, Nevada, their loyalties are torn. Although they continue to help him, they warn Nick that Nevada is the best in the world and a veteran of numerous anarchist operations, though none of them have resulted in physical harm to anyone. The hackers later discover that Chord has killed Nevada and taken his place. After both Nick and Chord throw off the police, Nick crashes his car and Chord shoots him. Chord hacks into the entire Internet and virtually every website is replaced with a teaser of Jill's revealing video. When the site goes live, Chord explains that instead of a sex tape, she will be killed live on the Internet unless her fans immediately close the browser window. The site's traffic increases dramatically and Chord fakes her death at an abandoned factory. Jill plays along with Chord and says that she understands the point about society that he is making. However, when his guard is down, she flees. Nevada reveals to Chord that he is still alive and has been impersonating Nick the whole time. The real Nick was safely hidden in Nevada's car trunk, and the whole scenario was an operation designed to flush Chord out. Nevada and Jill escape to safety in a bunker before explosives blow up the factory, killing Chord in his own trap. Nevada and Jill discuss what to do next, and she asks to accompany him as he retreats back into the underground hacker movement.

He found writing the script a challenge, as he had to create the film's plot as well as give specific reasons for each window that opened and why the point of view would shift between the characters. Vigalondo approached Wood specifically to star in the film and actress Sasha Grey was brought on board the project after she asked her manager to get her a copy of the script and set up a meeting with the director. The film appealed to Grey, as she was a fan of Vigalondo's work but was also intrigued by the character of Jill as a public figure and as someone who has to deal with \\"criticism and scrutiny and online haters and cyber stalkers\\". On 1 April 2014, Cinedigm acquired the US distribution rights to the film. Filming took place in Madrid, Spain, during the last week of October 2012, and in Austin, Texas. Wood being interviewed via Skype at the Los Angeles premiere at Cinefamily Release The film had its world premiere at South by Southwest on 10 March 2014, and was screened in Los Angeles as part of SpectreFest on 4 October that year. Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports a 40% score of 40 critics surveyed; the average rating is 5.35/10. The site's consensus states: \\"Open Windows is undeniably ambitious; unfortunately, director Nacho Vigalondo's reach far exceeds his grasp.\\" The film has a score of 47 out of 100 based on 10 reviews at Metacritic. We Got This Covered praised the acting of Wood and Grey while stating overall that \\"Open Windows spams audiences with an overload of development without much explanation, much like those information-less ads claiming to solve your impotency problem with a magic formula.\\" Shock Till You Drop panned the film and gave it a rating of 4 out of 10, criticizing it as the \\"biggest disappointment of the fest.\\" Justin Chang of Variety wrote, \\"A fiendishly inventive thriller built around an audacious if unsustainable gimmick, Open Windows elevates Hitchcockian suspense to jittery new levels of mayhem and paranoia.\\" John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that only genre diehards are likely to accept the level of suspension of disbelief necessary to enjoy the film. Jeannettte Catsoulis of The New York Times described it as \\"cleverly designed but hellish to watch\\" due to its overdone plot twists.

Her music has been noted for its attribution to multiple genres and defining contemporary Arabic music . Benali's southern Tunisian upbringing and fascination with Middle Eastern and Arab legendary artists is palpable in her music style. Her voice has been dubbed as multicultural and polymorphic. Born in Brussels (Belgium), and raised in Zarzis, Tunisia, Benali embarked on her music career in the early 90s, during the rise of world music phenomena that exposed her to different cultures and philosophies. After finishing her science and mathematics studies at the age of 19, Benali returned to Brussels to study graphic design at the Institut Saint-Luc of Graphic Arts. Soon she became a widely recognized songstress in Europe, and in 2012 she made her debut on an Arab stage. Some of the most prominent projects Benali has worked on are Kafichanta, Wild Harissa, Romeo and Leila, Al Palna and The Indian Hadra, Ghalia Benali sings Oum Kalthoum, Allegory of Desire and MwSOUL. In addition she made acting debuts and collaborated with international bands such as Spy from Cairo, Mad Professor, and The Metropole Orchestra. Early life Ghalia Benali was born in Brussels, Belgium on December 21, 1968 to Ali Benali, a Physician and cytologist, and Najia Somai, a Beautician. She has three younger brothers Zied, Taher and Bechir. At the age of four, Benali's father ended his medical studies and decided to return to the family's homeland, where she later grew up in Zarzis, a coastal town in southeastern Tunisia. As a young girl, she started exploring her melodic fascination with recitations of the Quran, Indian and Egyptian cinema, in addition to Middle Eastern and Arab musicians as Oum Kalthoum, Sabah Fakhri and Adib AlDayikh. With the support of her mother, Benali used to play dress up at family gatherings and perform to her guests, yet due to her shy nature, singing for a crowd was rather challenging. She would occasionally pretend being interviewed in front of her bedroom's mirror. Before becoming an artist and musician, she hoped for a job that would allow her to travel and explore the world and even considered becoming a flight attendant. After finishing her science and mathematics studies at the age of 19, Benali returned to Brussels to study graphic design at the Institut Saint-Luc of Graphic Arts to express herself through imagery and artistry. After graduating, Benali became an independent artist and graphic designer. Soon her passion for music further nourished after performing at her friend's birthday, which she considers the day it all started.  Career beginnings  On December 21, 1993, Benali celebrated her 25th birthday, first rise on stage and the 10th anniversary of a venue called Amadeus. She performed with an oriental band she met on stage, together with J.P. Gebbler, a Belgian jazz player, classical western musicians and a flamenco band. In June 1994, CASA CAIUS invited her to tour in Portugal, where she performed a line-up of 6 concerts in some of the most iconic historical places in North Portugal for Roland company. Four years later, the musician collaborated with stylist, Vanessa Neirynck, in the international competition of styling ‚ÄúBrothers cup‚Äù in China and came in second. Later on, she left for Rajasthan, India, to learn dancing. In 1999, Benali was invited by Kunsten-festival-des arts to perform in a concert in Bazaar in Brussels on a project with a new band that later on will be known as Timna/Wild harissa. Music ventures = Kafichanta = Hoping to present the music of Arab cabaret to the Europeans and remain in touch with her origins, Benali performed with the trio \\"Kafichantas\\" with lute player, Moufadhel Adhoum, and percussionist, Azeddine Jazouli. The project was a mean to take westerners on a journey of Arabic culture. = Wild Harissa and Nada = While experiencing with acting and cinema, the songstress released her first two albums, ‚ÄúWild Harissa‚Äù, a collaboration with Timna in 2001, and ‚ÄúNada‚Äù in 2002. = Romeo and Leila = In 2003, Benali started working on a multidisciplinary project that included music, story-telling, dancing and graphics. ‚ÄúRomeo and Leila‚Äù is a Ghalia Benali autobiography, for every mythical character mentioned in the fictional tale refers to someone she met in her real life journey. As a young artist, Benali left her country and safe haven, searching for a love she only dared dream of. Facing different cultures, beliefs and social pressures, her departure was anything but mundane. In the tale of Romeo and Leila, Benali is both the hero and heroine. Both rising from different worlds, the only thing that could bring them together in harmony is acceptance. The short story is about a secluded and overly-protected princess and five short journeys she has to take to reach the divine perfection found in love. During her hunt for five pearls that would be her liberator, she learns the lesson of a lifetime. Originally written in French and translated to English and Arabic, ‚ÄúRomeo and Leila‚Äù shows us that love is rebirth, never death, as tradition and literature tend to carve in our subconscious. The tale was performed by Benali as a musical in Belgium. The personal project was not recorded with a music label, but with the help of the Palestinian founder of Amal Festival in Santiago de Compostella in Spain, Ghaleb Jaber, and the Flemish community of Belgium. The album was released in 2006. = Al Palna and The Indian Hadra = Ghalia Benali has always been spellbound by the Indian culture and its visionary art. The music, costumes, colorful fabrics and choreography have mesmerized her to the extent that she would listen to radio stations broadcasting Indian music during school classes. Years later, the songstress felt the need to infuse her Arabic roots with the Indian ethnicity in the one way she can truly express her soul, music. In 1991, Benali attended the Indian school in Brussels where she met sitar player, Bert Cornelis. After a long jamming session, the song ‚ÄúBharat‚Äù came to life, which evolved over the years to set the tone of ‚ÄúAl Palna‚Äù album. The name of the album signified the amalgamation of the Arabic and Indian cultures. The word Al means the in Arabic, while Palna means cradle in Hindi. The album was released in 2008, followed by a tour in India in 2009. The intimate audience of avid music and poetry-recitation lovers continuously appeared entranced with the uniting classical Arabic and Indian tunes. Spiritual poetry about Love, also known as Ghazal, was a commonly performed genre. Later on, Al Plana was reborn in Egypt as ‚ÄòThe Indian Hadra‚Äô with violin player, Ayman Asfour, and Arabic percussionist, Ayman Mabrouk. The Indian sitar and tablas, while chanting Sufi Arabic words took the audience on a divine journey. It was a project meant for liberal souls and minds. The music is closer to an Athan, which is a call to pray for God. = Ghalia Benali sings Oum Kalthoum = Ghalia Benali have always been fascinated by Oum Kalthoum, the most prominent of all Egyptian and Arab female singers. Listening to ‚ÄúAl Atlal‚Äù song as a child has shaped her passion for music. The love for the music legend ran in the family, where her parents hung a picture of Oum Kalthoum on their bedroom wall. Benali, being the imaginative child she was, believed the photo was of her grandmother. Years later, Benali still as passionate as ever about her fictional and honorary grandmother, she decided to embrace the love the Arab world has for her music icon and pay tribute as a loyal granddaughter. Yet instead of giving the audience a reiterated performance, she created her own rendition of the renowned music that captured her music style, Tunisian essence and spirituality. The Oum Kalthoum album, which consisted of five songs, was recorded in Jet studio in Brussels in 2008. Participated in this project, double bassist Vincent Noiret, rek player Azeddine Jazouli and oud player Moufadhel Adhoum. The album appeared under the Dutch label \\"Music and Word\\" in 2010. The project was a huge success in Europe, thousands attended the shows regardless of the language barrier. Benali has turned it into an experience rather than a performance, with her signature body language that translated the lyrics that are beyond Europeans‚Äô comprehension. = The Voice = By the year 2012, Benali had already made a name for herself in Europe, yet she still yearned for a connection with the Arab audience which led to her next career move. ‚ÄúThe Voice‚Äù talent show on MBC channel was premiering the same year and the management team contacted Benali to participate in their first season. She left quite an impression during her breakthrough appearance on the show while performing ‚ÄúYa Mesafer Wahdak‚Äù by Mohamed Abdel Wahab. However, she felt her free spirited performance and unique cultural-blending style was not the traditional music the show was looking for. Yet, for the first time, Benali came face-to-face with the Arab audience and sensed what they were looking for in an artist. = Allegory of Desire = Later in 2013, Ghalia Benali collaborated with Zefiro Torna and the vocal consort of Berlin on a new project. Inspired by The Song of Songs, a series of lyrical poems organized as a dialogue between a young woman and her lover in the last section of the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible, the Allegory of Desire came to life. The music involved single voiced madrigals accompanied by instruments, vocal duets and trios, a women's choir and polyphonic settings by composers such as Hildegard of Bingen, De Machaut, Dunstable, Agricola, Lassus, Grandi, Sances, Monteverdi, Sch√ºtz, Buxtehude and J. Ch. The project created an inspiring dialogue between cultures while narrating texts by Sufi poets such as Rabaa Al-Adawia and a young aspiring generation of poets such as Egyptian Abdallah Ghoneim and Mohamed Zakaria. Lyrics were written and composed by Benali herself. The international cast took their project to Mechelen, Berlin, Hamburg, N√ºrnberg, Winterthur, Sevilla and Vilnius, and an album was released in 2016 by Warner classics. = MwSOUL = It was during the revolution that people from all over the Middle East felt connected on a spiritual level no matter which country they came from. Tunisian-born and Brussels-based, Ghalia Benali, felt an otherworldly homogeneity with freedom seekers miles away and it felt as if she was destined for her new career venture. MwSOUL, translated as connected, was Benali's next music project. It is considered her most Sufi and spiritually oriented work. Most of the lyrics were written by her, yet the ‚ÄúMwSOUL‚Äù hit was written by the aspiring Egyptian poet, Abdallah Ghoneim. It all started during the revolution when Egypt shut down the internet and Benali lost connection with the youth. Ghoneim sent her a poem about souls and hearts intertwining, regardless of their inability to physically meet. The songstress tried to understand her own emotions regarding deaths, crimes and conspiracies and seek the true essence of the events. To her, freedom was never about over throwing political figures, so instead, Benali immediately started recording the powerful poem tackling the individual's path towards liberty. MwSOUL is a project that blends classic and contemporary Arab lyrics. The music using breath (Brass) and beat (Perscussion) was written by Benali, referring to the soul and heart, and arranged by Belgian group, M√¢√§k, with whom Benali has been collaborating for over 20 years, and led by trumpeter Laurent Blondiau with the excellent oud of Moufadhel Adhoum. Benali graces the stage in the MwSOUL performance and creates a pulse that is organically provided by oud, flute, trumpet, sax, sousaphone & drums, along with her dark and commanding voice and horns that add punchy rhythmic riffs. From moments of calm voice tagged solely with oud or sousaphone to full-throated vocal notes, the performance is a roller coaster of beats and emotions. The album is recorded with W.E.R.F label and is released in May 2017.  MWSOUL Art Foundation  After years of struggling with unorganized management, Ghalia Benali finally decided to take things in her own hand and founded an outlet that exhibits her art, music and literature. The MWSOUL Art Foundation is a non-profit establishment that aims at raising awareness by reviving and connecting the authentic cultural roots through different kinds of arts.  Art projects  = One hour before the Gods Awake = Immediately after finishing the MwSOUL project, Benali created a manuscript called ‚ÄúOne hour before the Gods Awake‚Äù that includes 59 short fictional tales accompanied by 59 art works. The images and texts tell an imaginary and fantasy-oriented version of real unfolded events. From reiterating old mythologies and legends about the beginning of human kind to recreating newer and more passionate versions, the manuscript is nothing but uninhibited creativity. Benali turned her passion into an exceptional electro musical project, with songs and videos that captured a strong message. The art work's line and structure is created by Ghalia Benali, while the text - or the tales - is by contemporary writers from all over the Arab world. The story line has 59 images, with 59 texts representing the 59 minutes it took humanity to reach awareness. = Draw Me a Doll Project= Fascinated as a child by ‚ÄúThe Little Prince‚Äù novel by Antoine de Saint- Exup√©ry, the renowned literature quote ‚ÄúDraw me a sheep‚Äù have constantly consumed Ghalia Benali's thoughts. For years, the musician has failed to purchase the doll of her dreams, so instead she made one. Trying hard to find each doll the face it was meant to have, she opted to leave them unidentified, which eventually matched the persona she always imagined. The concept of ‚ÄúDraw Me a Doll‚Äù project is that what a person choose to wear might suggest his/her character, yet it will never embody the soul and authentic nature. The project tackles themes such as freedom, inspiration, beauty, skin-color, diversity, acceptance while highlighting Benali's opposition to prejudice, racism and body shaming. The art dolls are made from spare scraps of cloth material, stuffed with raw sheep wool. They can be white, black, red or green. The fabrics used for the dresses are vintage silk, lace and leather, with gold and silver accessories. The scrawny arms and legs are similar to botanical roots. = Slides of Life = As a child with a wild imagination, Ghalia Benali virtually traveled the world in her head, without ever leaving the comfort of her home. Feeling chased out of her safe haven, Benali refused to accept the reality of selling her house which embodied her dreams and memories. Mourning her past, the songstress started showing a fascination in creating miniature worlds, with their own fantasy and drama, in small boxes. Each box is a slide of life, a vulnerable little world that is a cabinet of curiosity. The observer feels sympathy and recognizes himself in the tiny figures and relate to their ignorance and frailty. There is enough space for one viewer at a time which gives a sense of privacy and intimacy. Benali chose the dolls used in architectural modelling to represent her characters. The boxes have a vintage feel to it, like most of Benali's work, which is about memories and souvenirs. All the objects, fabrics, jewelry and tiny details are covered in dirt, torn and shredded. Benali aimed at recycling un-useful objects in our daily life, to give them a new purpose and meaning. The dioramas, as the musician named them, incorporate a painted background that employ a false perspective and carefully modifying the scale of objects. = Underskin = One of the most spiritual and philosophical projects Ghalia Benali had worked on is ‚ÄúUnderskin‚Äù. During an extremely rough patch in the musician's life, feelings such as anger, jealousy, hatred and sadness emerged, along with many unanswered questions. The spiritual aspect of the project was depicted in all the different answers found that carried the same message. A message of visualizing life's experience, standing in the middle of a universe, connecting the land and sky and just being one with your surroundings. It all started in 2005 when Benali envisioned existence as a tree that gave out life through branches that intertwined and flourished. The songstress's pregnancy was portrayed as a tree with its roots entrenched in a hemi-sphere, that represented a mother's belly. The deeply embedded roots in the soil represented a myth regarding the unborn's personality, hidden deep inside the songstress's body. Ghalia Benali used ink, needle and a vintage pencil plume and chose one of her paintings to be tattooed on her body. The message of ‚ÄúUnderskin‚Äù is that you are the tree, you are the branches and you are the fruits. Inside you lies a fountain that never dries out.  Musical style and influences  Ghalia Benali's voice has been dubbed as multicultural and polymorphic. Spending the first four years of her life in Brussels, Benali's parents found comfort away from their homeland in music. Her mother highly appreciated French, Indian and Egyptian music while her father had an inclination towards Classical music such as Beethoven, in addition to Iraqi and Jordanian tunes. Her music has been noted for its attribution to multiple genres. Benali's southern Tunisian upbringing and fascination with Middle Eastern and Arab legendary icons such as Oum Kalthoum, Abdel Basit Abdel Samad and Adib ElDayekh (AlMashayekh school) are palpable in her music style. Other influential sources on Benali's mystical and spiritual art are Hazrat Inayat Khan and Sri Aurobindo, one of the greatest thinkers in India, and the cultures of Flamenco and gypsies of Rajasthan.

Plot Charles Parnell Cassidy, the premier of New South Wales, arrives in London to visit his estranged daughter, Charlotte (also known as \\"Charlie\\"). Cassidy commits suicide, leaving Charlie a briefcase with a video and computer discs. The video explains his death, and details his corrupt dealings, which are substantiated by the evidence on the disks. As executor of Cassidy's estate, Charlie is given the option of selling the files to Cassidy's business partner for $20 million, handing them over to the NSW Attorney-General or carrying on her father's business. She returns to Sydney to deal with his political and business legacies. Charlie's central role in the plot is a departure from West's novel, which used Cassidy's son-in-law as the main protagonist.

Scott Murray, Australia on the Small Screen 1970-1995, Oxford Uni Press, 1996 p183 Plot November 1942. A unit of inexperienced Australian soldiers arrives at the frontlines in New Guinea as Allied troops drive back the crumbling Japanese forces. One is private Stan Davidson, eager but naive. The newcomers soon receive some harsh lessons in the realities of warfare as they and their US allies encounter the savage and fanatical Japanese. Nervous young Lieutenant MacDonald leads Davidson's section on a patrol and they come across what appears to be a deserted enemy camp. However it is a trap staged by two Japanese soldiers, the only survivors of their unit, hiding in a concealed bunker. MacDonald flees in terror, abandoning his men, most of whom are wiped out by booby-traps and machine-gun fire, leaving only Davidson and Mick Murphy alive, sheltering in a ditch. Davidson returns fire, killing one of the Japanese but the other, Junji Hayashi, pins the two Australians down with his machine-gun. Murphy is badly wounded and in agony and a distraught Davidson is forced to kill him to put him out of his misery. The subsequent stand-off lasts for many hours until both men are exhausted. Hayashi finally emerges from the bunker and makes a screaming Banzai charge but Davidson shoots him. 1944\\\\. Davidson is now back in Australia and he is assigned to guard duties at the POW camp at Cowra, NSW. The Japanese POWs are segregated in their own camp and are kept confined, unlike the gentler Italian POWs who are allowed to work on nearby farms. Davidson is amazed to discover that Hayashi has survived his wounds and is now in the camp. The two begin to talk and gradually form an unlikely friendship. Mick Murphy's widow Sally lives near the camp and Davidson finds himself romantically drawn to her, although he cannot bring himself to tell her the truth of what happened in New Guinea. Davidson's experiences has made him hate the war and he finds his attitudes towards the Japanese softening, causing a rift with the other guards, although he gets along well with Private Hook and Corporal Doyle, both former Anzacs from the First World War. Hayashi himself has no stomach for more fighting but a hard-line element amongst the POWs incites fanaticism, making many of the prisoners feel both ashamed at having been captured and determined to either fight or die an honourable death. Davidson, trying hard to understand the culture and the minds of the POWs, soon senses that something is brewing but his concerns fall on deaf ears, including those of newly promoted MacDonald, who escaped punishment for his cowardice in New Guinea and who is now one of the senior officers at Cowra. The Japanese POWs begin to plan a massed riot and break-out and most of the prisoners join in. Even Hayashi overcomes his reluctance and agrees to participate. Davidson, Hook and Doyle are all convinced that the POWs are planning something but their CO Major Dorden still refuses to believe it. Finally in the early hours of 5 August 1944, the Cowra Breakout occurs as hundreds of POWs attempt a massed breakout, storming the gates and wire, brandishing makeshift weapons. Many of the prisoners are cut down as the guards open fire. Hook and Doyle, firing a heavy machine-gun, are over-run by a mob of Japanese and both are beaten to death but not before Hook manages to remove the firing bolt, preventing the prisoners from using the weapon. Hundreds of POWs escape into the surrounding bush. The following day MacDonald is ordered to lead a unit of troops to re-capture the POWs. They encounter a fanatical group who refuse to surrender. Abandoned by his men, MacDonald is killed by the Japanese who then all commit suicide. Back in the camp, most of the surviving POWs (which includes those who were recaptured and those who chose not to participate in the breakout) are bitter and remorseful over what has happened. One of the ringleaders (the lead of them) who incited the breakout yet who stayed in his barracks is forced to commit ritual suicide by his furious comrades. The rest of the prisoners still on the loose are soon either re-captured or shot by trigger happy soldiers and civilians. Hayashi is one of the last prisoners still at large when he reaches the farmhouse of Sally Murphy where Davidson is also present. Relieved to see his friend, Hayashi comes forward to give himself up but he is then shot dead by a group of soldiers nearby. Davidson sadly examines Hayashi's personal diary which ominously reveals that the latter's family reside in Hiroshima. A written postscript at the start of the end credits pays tribute to the 231 Japanese and 4 Australians who lost their lives in the Cowra Breakout.

He is noted for various statues in London, his 1881 bronze statues of Patrick Sarsfield in the grounds of St John's Cathedral in Limerick, and the 1889 statue of Bishop Delany at St Mary's Cathedral in Cork. Lawlor received his art training at the Royal Dublin Society's Schools, studying sculpture under John Smyth (c1773-1840). In 1843 the Royal Irish Art Union purchased his \\"Cupid pressing Grapes into the Glass of Time,\\" and was won as a prize by the Countess of Ranfurly. He exhibited a \\"Boy and Dog\\" at the Royal Hibernian Academy in 1844, and was one of eight artists commissioned to produce the plaques on the corners of the Albert Memorial in Kensington Gardens, also executing the large group \\"Engineering.\\" In 1845 he moved to London, soon being recognised as an accomplished sculptor, first living in Wyndham Street, then moving to Stanhope Street, Hampstead Road, where he was still staying in the 1880s. After his arrival in London he worked for a period with John Thomas, helping to create some of the figures adorning the exterior of the Houses of Parliament, though it is difficult to attribute individual figures to one or the other. In 1847 he joined the Royal Academy schools on Thomas‚Äôs recommendation. His first exhibition at the Royal Academy was in 1848. From his first contribution in 1844 he continued to exhibit at intervals with the Royal Hibernian Academy. His \\"Bather\\" was exhibited there in 1851, and at the Dublin International Exhibition in 1853, and was later rendered in marble for the Prince Consort and placed at Osborne in 1856. His statuette, \\"Solitude,\\" and the group \\"Suffer little Children to come unto Me\\", were purchased by the Art Union, and appeared in the London Exhibition of 1851. Other works by Lawlor which received acclaim were \\"Titania,\\" a marble statue in the Royal Academy in 1868, the \\"Emigrant\\" of 1853 and \\"Clio\\". He visited America in 1886, and received a number of commissions, remaining there until the autumn of 1888. On his return he stayed in Cork for some time, finishing the statue of Bishop Delany which was placed outside the Cathedral, and some statues for the Queenstown church in Cork. He did quite a number of busts including that of \\"Daniel O'Connell,\\" \\"Smith O'Brien,\\" John O'Connor Power and \\"James O'Kelly, M.P.\\" He was a popular figure in London's artistic and literary circles, his tall, striking appearance, ready wit, genial manner and fine baritone making him a sought- after guest. He did not produce a steady output, but rather worked only when the inclination took him or when obliged by financial necessity, and thus did not provide for his old age. He remained a bachelor his entire life. His sister Bridget had married John Kelly, a blacksmith and draymaker, and remained in Dublin. When her husband died in 1861, she herself in poor health, moved to London with her five children. Aloysius, the youngest boy, became an accomplished painter under the name Aloysius O'Kelly. In London, John Lawlor had become a loyal supporter of the secret Irish Republican Brotherhood or Fenians, and was careful to keep his political affiliations out of his public life as an artist. His home was regarded as a safe house by the movement.

Of East Pakistan in the High Court of East Pakistan, dt. 16 December 1965  Early years and education  Barada was born in Binyafair village, in the Tangail district of what is now Bangladesh in 1901. His father was a priest, Haragopal Chakraborty and mother, an educated lady (up to middle school), Soudamini Devi. Barada Bhushan married Ashalata, younger by 11 years, in 1922. He studied primary classes in his village school and then moved to North Bengal's Dinajpur town to study in a middle school, 'Dinajpur Academy'. After his entrance examination, he went to Calcutta, and graduated in Arts from Vidyasagar College of Calcutta University; he received a post graduate degree from the Law College passing LLB. After obtaining the law degree he returned to Dinajpur and started practising in the Dinajpur Bar. (Subsequently, during his political detention for eight years (1930‚Äì1938), he passed his MA and also received the title, 'Pandit' after obtaining two degrees in Sanskrit scholastic, 'Rashtrabhasha Visharada' and 'Kavyatirtha' appearing for all the exams from jails.) Political activism during British rule At the outset Barada Bhushan Chakraborty was not inclined in political activities, except in one or two incidents, during his school days, when he responded to Gandhi's call. It all happened when, in late 1920s, his wife, Ashalata Chakraborty @Ashadi, younger brother, Kulada Prasad Chakraborty @ Neru and cousin, Satyabrata Chakraborty @ Satu along with their friend Hrishikesh Bhattacharya joined the armed revolutionary group, Anushilan Samity. These young people's activities started drawing him into the freedom struggle, initially slowly, but within a couple of years, he was completely involved, and became one of their leaders. In 1930 the 'Hili Station Mail Operation' was planned and executed, though unsuccessfully. Ashalata, Barada Bhushan, Satyabrata, Hrishikesh and others were arrested, Kulada Prasad fled to Mungher in Bihar. During the operation a coolie was injured by gun bullet and later died in a Calcutta hospital. The British government initiated a case calling it the Hili Mail Dacoity case. In the trial Barada Bhushan was jailed for eight years (1930‚Äì1938), Ashalata, among others got a lesser term (2 years), whereas Satyabrata and Hrishikesh were deported to Andaman Island's Cellular Jail from 1930 to 1947 till India's independence. During the Quit India movement in 1942 he led Gandhiji's movement in Dinajpur and was jailed for a year. Later he left Gandhiji's path and joined the Communist Party of India (CPI) and remained a dedicated communist till his death. In 1946 he, with others from the CPI, organised the most significant peasant movement of Bengal, the Tebhaga Movement. He was in charge of the movement in Dinajpur to control and connect the movement throughout the district. Dinajpur district's movement was one of the fiercest, and many villagers were killed by the British. He was arrested by the British and was kept in jail till India was declared independent and Pakistan was born in 1947. Later activism He continued to lead the Tebhaga movement in Pakistan after Independence. As a Hindu by birth, he was a soft target of the newly constituted Pakistan. In 1948 Pakistani government arrested him not as a leader of the peasant's unrest but as a security prisoner. After a year he was released but then taken into custody under the Special Powers Ordinance. This time he remained behind bars for a year, and was released on 21.9.51 only to be rearrested the same day under the same ordinance, and imprisoned until July 1952, when the country's Language Movement (Bhasha Adolan) was gaining importance. Barada Bhushan Chakraborty was a guide to the students of the district who were involved in the Language movement. He was arrested for two years (1954‚Äì55), during which the movement was thinning. When General Ayub Khan declared martial law, Barada Bhushan was among the leaders who protested. At this he was taken into custody by the new rulers without a specific charge and kept him in prison for two years. At this, protest erupted in both East and West Pakistan; before the High Court was to decide upon a Habeas Corpus petition on it, he was unconditionally released by the authorities. But when Pakistan and India were engaged in the War of 1965, he was arrested twice and kept in prison for about three years During the Bangladesh Liberation War (Muktijuddha), Barada Bhushan led his district. He was arrested during this time and was placed, along with others, before the firing squad inside the Dinajpur Jail. Fortunately, at this hour the armed freedom fighters (Muktijoddhas) broke in the jail and snatched them out after a brief encounter with the Pakistani army. Thereafter Barada Bhushan remained in charge of the fighters' control room and kept the town free from Pakistani armies for 13 days, until the reinforced army raided the town killing hundreds. Barada Bhushan, along with thousands of the town, took refuge in India, guiding fighters from there. He returned to Bangladesh immediately after the independence, but with a frail health which aggravated his cancer. Bhushan died on 5 November 1974 in Calcutta, where he was brought for cancer treatment with assistance from Mujibur Rahman, the then Prime Minister of Bangladesh.

Production FX announced in July 2012 that it had renewed Louie for a fourth season to consist of 13 episodes, and was later confirmed in October 2012 that the season would be delayed from airing in summer 2013 to May 2014, to give more time for Louie C.K. to develop the season.

I want a little breathing room.\\" In March 2014, FX announced the season would premiere on May 5, 2014, moving to Mondays and would air back-to-back episodes for seven consecutive weeks, containing an additional fourteenth episode. C.K. said that after the season's third episode, the fourth season would include a multi-part, connected storyline. C.K. collaborated with comedian Steven Wright (who previously guest starred on the series as himself) on some of the scripts for the fourth season, and Wright is credited as a consulting producer for the season.

It was written and directed by series creators Damon Beesley and Iain Morris. The film involves four school friends who meet up again for a holiday in Australia, and stars Simon Bird, Joe Thomas, James Buckley and Blake Harrison. In media interviews, the film's writers and actors stated that it was to be an end to the series. The Inbetweeners 2 was released on 6 August 2014 in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland, to positive reception from critics. It surpassed the record of its predecessor for the highest gross on the opening day of a comedy in the UK, with ¬£2.75 million, and ended its first weekend with a gross of ¬£12.5 million, the largest opening of any film in 2014, then remained on top for a second week. With an overall gross of ¬£33.3 million, it was the highest-grossing British film in the domestic market in 2014. On 21 August, it was released in Australia, to a mixed reception, and topped the box office in its opening weekend. Plot Will, Neil and Jay's girlfriends; Alison, Lisa and Jane who they met in Malia have broken up with them since the events of the last film several months prior. Simon, who is at the University of Sheffield, is unhappy with his relationship with Lucy, who has become obsessive and abusive. Will is studying at the University of Bristol, but is regularly ostracised by the other students, whilst Neil is working full time in a bank and Jay is taking a gap year in Australia. When Neil and Simon visit Will at Bristol for the weekend, Neil receives an e-mail from Jay, who claims that he is now a top DJ at a popular nightclub in Sydney, living in a luxury mansion and having daily sex with multiple women, including celebrities such as Elle MacPherson, Dame Edna Everage, and Kylie and Dannii Minogue. The trio decide to go to Australia to cheer themselves up and visit Jay for the Easter holidays. Upon arrival in Sydney, they discover that none of what Jay said was true, he merely works as a night club toilet attendant and lives in a tent in his Uncle Bryan‚Äôs front garden. Whilst at the night club, Will bumps into Katie; his \\"first love\\" from private school, who is backpacking in Australia whilst on a gap year. She invites Will to join her at Byron Bay, and he agrees. When the boys return to Jay's uncle's house, Simon attempts to break up with Lucy over Skype but is interrupted by Jay's uncle who heckles \\"marry me\\". Thinking it was Simon who asked her, she excitedly agrees, much to Simon's reluctance. Byron Bay The next day, the four travel to a youth hostel in Byron Bay. Will meets and tries to befriend Katie's backpacker group including Ben, who quickly deduces that Will lacks travel experience and is a holidaymaker rather than a fellow backpacker, and so mocks and remains passive-aggressive towards Will. Simon, after seeing pictures of Jane on Jay's computer, deduces that he is in Australia to try and win her back following their breakup as it is revealed that Jane is also travelling in Australia. Meanwhile, a drunken Katie takes a liking to Will, insisting that she would have sex with him if he could play guitar, much to Ben's annoyance. Will then sings an incredibly bad falsetto cover of \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" for Katie, who then seduces him back in the hostel dormitory and as they are about to have sex, she passes out but Will, who is fingering her, doesn't notice. A fellow backpacker soon comes in and, upon seeing Will's rape alarm on the floor, believes Will is taking advantage of a now unconscious Katie and so wrestles him to the ground, setting off the alarm in the process. The boys join the other backpackers at a water park named Splash Planet the next day, Jay eager to do so as he believes Jane is currently working there. At the park, Neil accidentally kills a dolphin by feeding it fast food, and Jay gets Simon beaten up by the fathers of some children after joking that he is a paedophile. Jay is soon told by a member of staff that Jane has since left Splash Planet and is now working in the outback, leaving Jay feeling heartbroken. Elsewhere, Ben challenges Will to a race on one of the park's waterslides, agreeing that the loser has to streak across the park. Simon and Neil join them, Neil panicking upon realising that he is about to soil himself due to his IBS symptoms. Immediately after Will enters the slide, Neil's faeces slip through his shorts and begin following Will down the slide. Will wins the race against Ben, but is immediately hit in the face by Neil's faeces as they fly out toward him, causing him to vomit uncontrollably, making everybody evacuate the pool. The boys later leave Splash Planet, and find Jay waiting by the car. Dejected and hopeless, Jay finally opens up to the others about his longing to reconnect with Jane, confirming that she dumped him after he bought her Wii Fit to encourage her to lose weight. Simon believes that Lucy will know where to find Jane and so asks her via Skype, discovering that Jane is working on a stud farm in the remote settlement of Birdsville. The boys prepare to drive there, except Will, who argues with Simon and insists he wants to become a \\"traveller\\" instead of a mere tourist, that they have nothing in common and the boys never take him seriously and so they angrily part ways, telling each other to grow up. Will stays in Byron Bay in the hopes of starting a relationship with Katie, while the other three head for Birdsville. Will ultimately struggles to fit in with the \\"spiritual\\" activities of the travellers and soon discovers that Katie is sleeping with multiple people at once, including Ben. He subsequently launches into one of his foul-mouthed tirades, which leads Katie into having sex with Ben in the hostel dormitory while Will is there. Regretting his decision to stay at Byron Bay, Will buys a flight ticket for $350 and reunites with the rest of the group in Birdsville. The car soon runs out of fuel in the middle of the desert, and the boys are unsuccessful in their attempts to call for help or find water. They later hold hands upon realising that they will most likely die, but are soon rescued by Jane and her work colleagues, who inform them that they were only stuck for two hours. Jane is left touched by Jay's efforts to win her over again, but ultimately does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house in Sydney, the boys discover that Jay's father and Will's mother have flown out after hearing of their near-death experience. To Will's abject horror and the other boy's amusement, they are joined by his nemesis Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form), who is now in a relationship with Will's mother. After being repeatedly insulted and belittled by his father and uncle Bryan, Jay attempts to punch Bryan, only to feebly slap him instead. Bryan subsequently insults Jay's dad for teaching Jay to \\"punch like a girl\\", and the two begin fighting clumsily. Over Skype, Lucy breaks up with Simon after revealing that she has been secretly having sex with Pete, one of Simon's friends from university, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging up on her. The group then drive off to continue travelling in Australia and stop in Asia on the journey home. In a montage during the final credits, the four boys decide to travel onwards from Australia to Vietnam. They are seen target-shooting guns in Cambodia and drinking with girls in Thailand; who are then revealed to be trans women beneath their skirts. Upon their return to the United Kingdom several months later, they all have grown their hair long and have gained the \\"backpacker look\\". Neil is in a relationship with an older female traveller from the Byron Bay hostel, while Will's mother announces her engagement to Mr. Gilbert, much to Will's horror. Realising the fact his old teacher will be his new stepdad, he runs back through the arrivals gate and is detained by airport security.

The filmmakers wanted to film another scene with her, but she was busy filming Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Production =Origin= Although originally intended as an unambiguous ending to the television series, the unexpected popularity and box office success of The Inbetweeners Movie led to speculation over the possibility of a sequel. These rumours began in early September 2011, while the film was still in cinemas, and were denied by its writers and actors. Around the same time, producer Christopher Young openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that \\"if there is a sequel it will come from the creative elements ... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and doing other things but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed.\\" Co- writer Damon Beesley later admitted \\"we didn't know how successful it would be and that it would have a life on screen. But they did translate to big-screen characters, people did care about them and did go back and see it more than once ‚Äì and that's very rare in cinema. The idea of not following that up seemed insane to most people\\". The actors had mixed emotions on making a sequel. Although Buckley and Thomas felt put off by the success of the first film, Harrison and Bird became convinced on reading the script. Iain Morris received inspiration for the film from his own experiences as a high school exchange student on Australia's Gold Coast, describing it as \\"a place where people go to get drunk, pick some fruit and get drunk again\\". =Development= On 21 August 2012, it was announced that a sequel was in early stages of pre-production. On 8 November, it was announced by series creators Morris and Beesley that a script was being written and it was at \\"version 0.5\\" On 2 August 2013, the sequel was officially confirmed for release in August 2014. The series' Facebook page revealed on 15 March 2014 that the sequel would be released on 6 August 2014. On 9 May 2014, a teaser trailer was released, in which the characters drive through the Outback and call an Aborigine a \\"fire wanker\\". A second trailer, this time full length, was released on The Inbetweeners official Facebook page on 18 June, showing more of the storyline. =Filming= Parts of the film were shot in the isolated Outback settlement of Marree, South Australia Filming began in Australia on 7 December 2013, before moving to the UK in January 2014. Part of the film was shot in Marree, South Australia, an isolated Outback settlement without mobile reception or Internet. Ben Palmer, the director of the first Inbetweeners film, was involved with Simon Pegg's film Man Up, so Morris and Beesley directed The Inbetweeners 2. Bird said that the actors were initially disheartened by the absence of Palmer, and nervous about the direction of Morris and Beesley due to their lack of experience in the position. Morris had considered filming the Australian scenes in South Africa due to the comparatively high costs in Australia, which despite a higher budget caused the sequel to have fewer resources than its predecessor. While all locations for the first film had been within 10 minutes of the hotel, locations in the second were separated by a three-hour flight and nine-hour car journey. During filming in the Outback, the Australian crew provided two doctors and 40 litres of IV fluid, although the only point in which a doctor was called was when Buckley thought that he was having a heart attack, which was in reality indigestion from chips and lager. Beesley considered it \\"the maniac's choice of a film to be your first film\\". The water park scenes were filmed at Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast, which Thomas described as \\"some quite challenging scenes\\". When asked whether he ever felt averse to any material in the film due to perceived offence, Morris said that the crew's attitude was \\"let‚Äôs shoot everything, push it, and then if it feels like too much when we‚Äôre watching it, we can always pull it back in the editing room\\". Release The film premiered at Leicester Square, London, on 5 August 2014. In Australia it was distributed by Roadshow Entertainment and released on 21 August. The same company took the film to New Zealand a week later. =Box office= The Inbetweeners 2 grossed ¬£2.75 million on its opening day of 6 August 2014, surpassing its predecessor as the top grossing opening day in the UK for a comedy film. By the end of its first weekend, it topped the UK box office with a gross of ¬£12.5 million, surpassing Transformers: Age of Extinction (¬£11.7 million) as the largest UK opening in 2014; this, however, was less than the ¬£13.2 million opening of The Inbetweeners Movie in 2011. It topped the box office for a second week, in which it grossed ¬£9.83 million. In its third week, it fell to second spot behind new release Lucy. In its opening week in Australia, the film grossed $3.155 million in Australian dollars, topping the box office and pushing Guardians of the Galaxy into second place. It fell to second place in its second week, with Guardians of the Galaxy returning to top spot. As of 12 October 2014, the film had made $55,652,783 in the United Kingdom, $6,598,273 in Australia, and $473,316 in New Zealand. With an overall gross of ¬£33.3 million, The Inbetweeners 2 was the highest grossing British or Irish film in the domestic market in 2014, ahead of Paddington (¬£27.9 million). It was the third highest grossing of any film in the UK and Ireland in 2014, after The Lego Movieand The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies. =Critical reception= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 68% based on 41 reviews. The site's consensus reads: \\"The hapless Inbetweeners reunite for another raunchy adventure that will satisfy fans' appetite for laughs, but a downturn in plausibility along with an uptick in mean-spiritedness makes for less fun than their previous exploits.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a 55/100 rating based on 7 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". United Kingdom Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph gave the film four stars out of five, saying \\"Perhaps the biggest compliment you could pay the film, apart from that it‚Äôs by and large hysterically funny, is that it is unmistakably film-like, with a smoothly arcing plot and gross-out moments staged with the verve and ceremony of an action-movie set-piece.\\" In The Guardian, Mike McCahill gave the film three stars. He found fault in its treatment of female characters, saying \\"Some of the abundant thought channelled into knob gags could have been diverted towards developing the boys' female counterparts beyond harpies and lust objects\\". Unlike Collin, he found The Inbetweeners 2 to resemble a television show more than a film: \\"as with the first film, number 2 never quite shakes its resemblance to primetime E4, complete with ad-ready fadeouts and Walkabout interiors...couldn't the vehicles transporting them to the wider world display slightly more ambition?\\". Chris Hewitt of Empire magazine gave the film four stars out of five, summing it up as \\"The Fannytastic Four leave us on a poo- flecked, piss-soaked, sun-burned high that more than overcomes its familiar flaws to become a real contender for the year‚Äôs funniest film. Four star wankers\\". A negative review came from Graham Young of the Birmingham Mail, who found the film's humour to be repetitive: \\"Damon Beesley and Iain Morris have both directed this sequel which lacks an emotional arc to create momentum...Yes, it can be funny, and you‚Äôd have to be a prude not to laugh...But the endless, alliterative phrases for sex and countless in-your- face sight gags dilute the characters and turn the mood wearingly lewd. Like Nick Frost‚Äôs The Cuban Fury [sic] earlier this year, The Inbetweeners 2 takes a funny premise ‚Äì and then ruins it.\\" Writing in The Observer, Jonathan Romney gave the film two stars out of five, summing it up as \\"British TV comedy's favourite Four Stooges take another holiday, resulting in fountainous poo, pee and puke, rampant misogyny, 'ironic' rampant misogyny, rampant 'irony', and that old Carry On staple, horror of sex (especially among the over-25s)\\". He however predicted that on the record of the first film, The Inbetweeners 2 would be a financial success. In Time Out, Tom Huddleston gave the film one star out of five, saying \\"‚ÄòThe Inbetweeners 2‚Äô is riddled with contempt: for its characters, for its audience and most notably for the entire female gender. That a film in 2014 can still get away with depicting all women as either dumb, hapless sluts or ball-busting harridans is frankly unbelievable.\\" Australia In Australia, Matthew Toomey, a film critic for 612 ABC Brisbane, gave The Inbetweeners 2 a B+. He said \\"Don‚Äôt expect a deep, underlying narrative. This is just a bunch of horny teenagers doing really dumb things. To each their own... but I was entertained. First and foremost, it shocked me ‚Äì and that‚Äôs not easy given how many movies I watch. It pushes the envelope a lot further than I expected and I'd highly recommend seeing the film in a packed cinema. The audience reactions would be hilarious.\\" Louise Keller of Urban Cinefile wrote a mixed review, stating that the film takes a long time to \\"get going\\" due to a \\"silly establishment skit\\". However, she concluded that \\"there is genuine affection with which the filmmakers portray their characters and as a consequence, the level of offence is lessened to some degree\\". Simon Miraudo of Quickflix gave the film three stars out of five, calling it \\"the biggest ribbing since The Simpsons invaded [Australia's] shores\\". Although opining that the film was \\"slightly more insensitive to its female leads than previous efforts\\", he concluded that a scene in which faeces chase Will down a waterslide \\"challenges Caddyshack for the mantle of 'Best Ever S*** in Water' gag\\".December 2015work=Quickflixdate=21 August 2014 In the Herald Sun, Leigh Paatsch gave the film one star. He criticised the casting, describing the main characters as \\"supposed to be aged about 20 [but] played by blokes who all look as if they‚Äôre 30-plus, and carry on as if they‚Äôre not yet 10\\", and also found the film misogynistic, saying \\"the derogatory manner in which women are spoken of (and often depicted) is relentlessly, callously crass. Sometimes even hateful\\". A mixed review from Philippa Hawker of the Sydney Morning Herald concluded \\"The Australian elements seem hastily inserted and incidental: the movie could have been set in any country that had a water park and a place to get lost. But as a hymn to male bonding, and an exploration of the comic possibilities of what happens when a turd hits a water slide, The Inbetweeners 2 is a precisely crafted, assured piece of work\\". =Home media= The Inbetweeners 2 was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2014. A DVD edition also including the first film was released at the same time. The DVD featured two audio commentaries ‚Äî one with Morris and Beesley and the other by the four lead actors ‚Äî in addition to a behind-the-scenes featurette, deleted scenes, and a blooper reel. The film's release on home media was sponsored by STA Travel, who offered a prize of a holiday to the Australian state of Queensland. Legacy At its premiere on 5 August 2014, Bird said of the film: In an interview with the BBC, Thomas said that Morris and Beesley had been \\"very adamant\\" that the series had finished. On his co-stars, he added \\"There is a bond there that I think would be a stupid thing to waste. You don't get that bond very often with other performers and we do have it and it's a valuable thing\\". In the same interview, when asked whether the series had finished, both co-creators answered with a simultaneous \\"Yes!\\". Morris expressed that \\"I think the time is right. After the first film, I wanted to hear more from Jay, Will, Neil and Simon. But this time I feel there is enough. There is more than enough Jay in this world\\", and Beesley added \\"The end of the story has always felt like the time where they go off and start living their adult life. And I think this film takes us up to that point\\". Various media outlets blamed The Inbetweeners 2 for an increase in a craze of deliberate defecation in swimming pools to distress other guests. They linked the craze, known as \\"logging\\" or \\"Code Brown\\", to a scene akin to it in the film.

His father may have been Marcus Lollius consul in 21 BC, or at least a very close relation of the older Lollius who was in high favor with Augustus. If so, his immediate family would have included Marcus Lollius as his brother, and he could have been the uncle of Lollia Saturnina and the Roman empress Lollia Paulina.\\"Lollius (5)\\", A Dictionary of Greek and Roman biography and mythology, William Smith, editor. (1870) Perseus Project Career and Horace Maximus had served as a Roman soldier in Hispania against the Cantabri under Augustus from 27 BC until 25 BC. When Maximus returned to Rome from Hispania, he became a student in studying Rhetoric.Highet, The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature, p. 96Horace, The Satires of Horace and Persius Maximus being a young man, became a friend of the Roman Poet Horace. In Horace's Epistles I, 2 and 18, are addressed to Maximus. In Epistle 2, Horace tells Maximus to read the epic poems of Homer again, to find a better expounder of ethics than the philosophers (1-4). Horace wants Maximus to learn what follies to avoid from the Iliad (5-16) and what virtues to cultivate from the Odyssey (17-26). In Epistle 18, reveals the career of Maximus.Harrison, Homage to Horace: A Bimillenary Celebration, p. 290 He is experiencing problems as being a courtier. If his nobility is recent, this might expose Maximus to all sort of snubs in the hierarchy of Roman society. Horace is advising Maximus that affability is the means between toadying and truculence, which is a virtue in social relationships. If he wants to maintain his position he will need to be accommodating in an agreeing way. Maximus must learn to respect the wishes of his superior‚Äôs friend. In the Epistle, Horace never reveals who is Maximus‚Äô superior friend, however he may have been a personage of princely descent as he is someone who enjoys a re-creation of the Battle of Actium in a country fish-pond.Harrison, Homage to Horace: A Bimillenary Celebration, p. 291 Maximus needs advice on treading the path of independence with a hierarchical aristocracy now transforming itself into a royal court. Maximus seems already on top and secure with his wealth, success, superior friends and some point in due course would want to remove his himself from the world.Harrison, Homage to Horace: A Bimillenary Celebration, p. 293 At this time Maximus, may have turned his hand to poetry and must have been offered a post in the Retinue of the future Roman emperor Tiberius.Horace, Horace: Epistles Book I, p. 136 The date of this event, may have taken place in 20 BC. Historian The English Poet of the Middle Ages Geoffrey Chaucer, who was the author of the poem, Troilus and Criseyde refers various times in the poem to Maximus, as myn auctor Lollius. Chaucer states that Maximus wrote an old story about the Trojan War in Latin and in his poem, Troilus and Criseyde is just retelling the story. In another poem written by Geoffrey Chaucer, The House of Fame, Chaucer introduces Maximus as a real historian. In The House of Fame poem, Chaucer puts Maximus on an iron pillar besides Dares and Homer.Highet, The Classical Tradition: Greek and Roman Influences on Western Literature, p. 97 Maximus being a possible historian could also be confirmed by Horace. In one of Horace‚Äôs Epistles, addressed to Maximus, Horace advises him to read Homer for the moral and philosophical content of the epics. He began: : The writer of the Trojan war, Maximus Lollius, : while you practiced speaking in Rome, I reread at Praeneste. There is a possibility that Maximus could have been an ancient historian on Trojan history. Chaucer with his early readers, could well have believed in the existence of Maximus being an authority on history. However there is no such historian, ancient or modern known to the world as Lollius Maximus. This claim can make available a major literary discovery of a lost work.

His death is the subject of the ballad Lord Spynie. Early life Lindsay was the fourth son of David Lindsay, 10th Earl of Crawford, by his wife Margaret Beaton, daughter of Cardinal Beaton, and was a younger brother of David Lindsay, 11th Earl of Crawford. At an early age he became one of the favourites of James VI of Scotland, and was chosen to be vice-chamberlain of his household. Helen Huntar, the wife of Alan Lentroun in St Andrews, was said to have committed adultery with Lindsay and his brother, David Lindsay, 11th Earl of Crawford.David Hay Fleming, Register of St Andrews Kirk Session, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1890), pp. 672-74. Courtier In October 1589 he accompanied the king when he went to Denmark to bring home his bride, Anne of Denmark. He lent a thousand crowns to the king, who promised on his return \\"to make him a lord\\", and wrote him a note to effect at the castle of Kronborg.Lives of the Lindsays, vol. 1 (London, 1858), pp. 318-9: Dalyell, Fragments, p. 83. On 6 May 1590, therefore, he received a charter of Spynie and other lands belonging to the see of Moray, which were erected into the barony of Spynie, together with the title of Baron Spynie, which was conferred on him and his heirs and assignees, the creation being confirmed on 4 November 1589. Lord Spynie, after his marriage to Jean Lyon, took up residence at Aberdour Castle. He hosted James VI and Anne of Denmark at Aberdour at the end of December 1590.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589-1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 442. Lord Spynie was one of the new members of the privy council, chosen after the reconstitution of the council in June 1592. On 15 August 1592 following he was accused by Colonel Stewart of having harboured the turbulent Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell. Spynie offered to fight the accuser, but the king would not permit this, and after a day had been appointed for the trial, Stewart was committed to Edinburgh Castle or Blackness Castle (sources differ), and Spynie to Stirling Castle. At the trial the accuser failed to make a case and Spynie was set free; but Spynie never regained the king's entire confidence. When, on 24 July 1593, Bothwell made his appearance before the king at Holyrood Palace, Spynie was one of those who interceded for him. On 27 December 1594 he was denounced for not appearing to answer charges; and on 24 February following proclamation was made against holding intercourse with him and \\"other adherents of Bothwell\\". Spynie made his peace with the king, and on 27 November 1595 was present at a meeting of the privy council, but their relations were never again quite cordial. On 18 November 1599 he had to promise the council to present Sir Walter Lindsay of Balgavie, a papal emissary, before the presbytery of Edinburgh, and was ordered to reside where they directed him until he satisfied them in reference to his religion. In 1600 a quarrel erupted between Lord Spynie and the Ogilvies which, though the council tried settle it, ultimately resulted on 26 November 1602 in a night attack by the Master of Ogilvie and his brother and 100 armed followers on the house of Lord Spynie at Kinblethmont. After blowing up the principal gate with a petard and firing cannon or \\"field pieces\\" at the windows, the assailants entered the house with cocked pistols and drawn weapons. They searched the house for Lord Spynie and his wife, but they had left two hours before. Finding they had escaped, the Ogilvies looted the mansion. James VI proclaimed on 1 December that the petard was such that \\"no man of whatsoever rank and calling can assure his own safety and preservation within his own house and iron yetts\\" and so any petards should be surrendered on pain of death.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1599-1604, vol. 6 (Edinburgh, 1884), pp. 491, 519-520, 522. On the revival of the ancient bishopric of Moray in 1605, Spynie, at the request of the king, resigned the temporalities, but the patronage of the living was reserved to the family. Death While, on 5 June 1607, at the foot of the stair of his lodgings in the High Street of Edinburgh, Spynie was witness to an encounter between his kinsmen, David Lindsay, 12th Earl of Crawford, and David Lindsay of Edzell, son of Walter Lindsay of Balgavie who had been murdered by Crawford. He endeavoured to interpose to prevent bloodshed and was slain by the young laird of Edzell by mistake.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 7 (Edinburgh, 1885), 383. The incident was told inaccurately in the old ballad Lord Spynie. Family The king used his influence to induce Dame Jean Lyon, daughter of John Lyon, 8th Lord Glamis, and widow first of Sir Robert Douglas, Master of Morton, and secondly of Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus, to agree to give Lord Spynie her hand in marriage, writing letters to both parties to urge their marriage.Lives of the Lindsays, vol. 1 (London, 1858), pp. 321-3: Miscellany of the Abbotsford Club, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1837), pp. 211-6.: Victoria Carr, 'The Countess of Angus's Escape', in Julian Goodare, Scottish Witches and Witch-Hunters (Palgrave, 2013), p. 37.

That‚Äôs one thing that my fans can look forward to.\\" He also added,\\"It's going to be new music for me, something that you haven't heard me do.\\" He added that the shift in image is also a way to \\"graduate\\" from his being identified with the popular kiddie talent search Little Big Star which he won in 2005. It was years 2012 through 2013 that he recorded most of the tracks featured on the album. Concepcion is thankful that he was given the chance to collaborate with the biggest names in the country's recording scene which includes Billy Crawford, Christian Bautista, Jay-R, among others.

Dating from the beginning of the 13th century, its nave is richly decorated with early 16th- century frescos painted by the Brarup workshop.\\"T√•gerup kirke\\", Historisk Atlas. Retrieved 2 August 2013.\\"T√•gerup Kirke\\", Den Store Danske. Retrieved 2 August 2013. History The church was originally dedicated to Our Lady as documented in a letter of indulgence from 1470. An altar dedicated to the Virgin Mary attracted large numbers of pilgrims on the Feast of the Annunciation until 1636. Little is known about the church's early ownership apart from the fact that the Crown had clerical appointment rights before the Reformation. The church remained under the Crown until 1725 when it was transferred to Emmerence von Levetzau together with Aalholm and Bremersvold. It continued to be owned by Bremersvold until it gained independence in 1911.Kirsten Weber-Andersen, Otto Norn, Aage Roussell, Gertrud K√∏bke Knudsen, \\"T√•gerup Kirke\\", Danmarks kirker: Maribo amt, Volume 8, 1951, Nationalmuseet, pages 659-677. Retrieved 14 July 2013. Architecture The church consists of a Romanesque chancel and nave, a Gothic tower and a more recent porch, all built in red brick. The chancel has lesenes on the east corners and a sloping base. The east gable's lower wall is engraved with crosses and emblems. There is a Romanesque window at the centre of the gable while a stilted arch frieze with saw-toothed courses decorates the gable at the lower roof level. A round- arched door on the south side of the nave is also topped with an arched frieze. The door on the north side has been bricked in. Several round-arched windows have survived. In the Late-Gothic period, a six-sectioned vault was added to the chancel while two cross-vaults covered the nave. The tower, also a Late-Gothic addition, is the same width as the nave and has a pyramidal spire. Rather drastic repairs were carried out by Hans J√∏rgen Holm in 1891-93.\\"T√•gerup kirke\\", Nordens kirker. Retrieved 3 August 2013. Interior The altarpiece contains a painting of Christ walking on water by Anton Dorph in a large Gothic frame. The pulpit in the Renaissance style is from 1586. There is a chancel-arch cross from the first half of the 15th century and another from around 1500 with a finely carved figure of Christ. Near the entrance, the Romanesque marble font with sculpted faces around the bowl is from Gotland. Frescos Crucifixion scene on the chancel vault The church is noted for its frescos. Those in the vaults of the nave and the chancel were uncovered and restored by Jacob Kornerup in the 1880s. Further restoration work was completed by Egmost Otto Lind in 1943. The frescos in the chancel, the oldest, are from the mid-15th century. Christ is depicted sitting on three rainbows while Mary, kneeling and bare-breasted, calls him. John wears a camel hide. The symbols of the Evangelists surround the figure of Christ who is topped by a crown of thorns and a cross. The text reads \\"VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS\\" and \\"ITE MALEDICTI IN\\". The style is simpler than normal with Christ's wounds depicted merely as small blots. The south segment depicts Pilate with a bowl of water. To the west, there are scenes of the whipping and the crucifixion with the two other victims and other figures including Mary and Mary Magdelene with a jug of ointment. The caption reads \\"Vere filius dei erat isle\\". The north segment displays scenes of the entombing and the resurrection. The frescos in the nave are from the early 16th century and are attributed to the Brarup workshop. In the first bay, there are scenes of the Creation with the sun and a comet while God stands with the moon in his hands. There are fish and a shrimp in the foreground as well as a mermaid. To the south, God is creating animals including a goose, a dove, a crane and deer. In the south segment, Adam and Eve are created. The text reads \\"ADAM PRIMUS HOMO DAMPNAVIT SECULO POMO\\". The west segment presents the Admonition and the Fall while in the centre an angel stands with a hand organ. The text reads \\" HIC ADAM ET EVA DECELTI SUNT A DRACONE\\". The Banishment in the north segment is accompanied by a text reading \\"HIC EXPELLANTUR DE PARADISO AB ANGLO CUM FLIENTE GLADIO\\". Adam, in everyday clothing, has an axe in his belt and is about the till the earth. Eve is sitting with her children, one with a top and a whip. The frescos from the Brarup workshop are quite different in style from those of the Elmelunde Master. God is not stereotyped. Like those from Isenfjord, they have energy. Eve, when working, holds the spindle correctly. In the scenes of the Banishment, Adam and Eve take long strides in contrast to Elmelunde where they are passive and static. In the illustration of the Fall and the Banishment, there are scenes of the Inverted World: a man shears the tail of a horse while another puts horseshoes on a cat. Both are based on items from Proverbes et rimes from 1480. Similar images can be seen in the churches of Hyllested, Brarup and H√§stveda. An older fresco of the Piet√† can be seen on the east wall behind the altar. Mary is sitting with her dead son on her lap. The depiction of expression of despair is outstanding among Danish frescos. In 2005, a number of other frescos were discovered on the east wall, possibly representing the faces of other figures associated with the crucifixion. The altarpiece has been repositioned on the north wall so that the east-wall frescos can be more easily seen.

Introduction Figure 1. Comparison of the sizes of conventional column flotation cells and Jameson Cells with similar capacities. The high intensity of the Jameson Cell means that it is much shorter than conventional column flotation cells (see Figure 1), and it does not require air compressors to aerate the suspension of ground ore particles and water (known as a slurry or pulp) in the flotation cell.G J Jameson, \\"Flotation cell development,\\" in: The AusIMM Annual Conference, Broken Hill, New South Wales, 17‚Äì21 May 1992 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1992), 25‚Äì31. The lack of a requirement for compressed air and the lack of moving parts means that power consumption is less than for the equivalent mechanical or conventional column flotation cell.M F Young, K E Barnes, G S Anderson and J D Pease, \\"Jameson Cell: the 'comeback' in base metals applications using improved design and flow sheets,\\" in: Proceedings of the 38th Annual Canadian Mineral Processors Conference, Ottawa, Ontario, 17‚Äì19 January 2006, (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum), 311‚Äì332. Accessed 23 May 2013. In contrast to most types of flotation cell, the Cell introduces the feed and the air to the Cell in a combined stream via one or more cylindrical columns referred to as \\"downcomers\\". Other types of flotation cell typically introduce the feed and the air separately to the cell. The Cell produces fast mineral flotation rates, especially for very fine mineral particles.

Operating principles Froth flotation is achieved by mixing chemicals known as collectors with the ore slurry. The collectors adsorb onto the surfaces of the particles of select minerals (usually the valuable mineral that is targeted for concentration), making these minerals hydrophobic. Air is passed through the slurry in a tank known as a flotation cell. The air is broken into tiny bubbles by various mechanisms (depending on the design of the flotation cell), and the now-hydrophobic minerals attach to the bubbles, rising with them to the surface of the flotation cell, where they form a froth. The froth flows over the top edge (or \\"lip\\") of the flotation cell and forms the flotation concentrate. Ideally, none of the unwanted mineral particles float, and they remain behind as the flotation tailings. However, the selectivity of the collection mechanism is not perfect. Some unwanted (\\"gangue\\") minerals are also carried into the froth, largely by entrainment with the water rising with the bubbles. This is particularly the case for particles less than 10 Œºm in size.N W Johnson and P D Munro, \\"Overview of flotation technology and plant practice for complex sulphide [sic] ores,\\" in: Mineral Processing Plant Design, Practice and Control, Eds A L Mular, D N Halbe and D J Barratt (Society for Mining, Metallurgy and Exploration: Littleton, Colorado, 2002), 1097‚Äì1123. Some of the gangue particles follow the water between the bubbles as it drains back to the underlying pulp. This process can be assisted by the application of sufficient \\"wash water\\" to the froth to displace the water entrained with the bubbles and the fine gangue particles brought with them.

Figure 2. A schematic diagram illustrating the operating principles of a conventional, mechanically agitated flotation cell. Froth flotation efficiency is determined by a series of probabilities: those of particle‚Äìbubble contact, particle‚Äìbubble attachment, transport between the pulp and the froth, and froth collection into the product launder.B W Atkinson, C J Conway and G J Jameson, \\"Fundamentals of Jameson Cell operation including size‚Äìyield response,\\" in: Sixth Australian Coal Preparation Conference, Mackay, Queensland, 6‚Äì9 September 1993 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993). In a conventional mechanically agitated cell, the void fraction is low (5‚Äì10%) and the bubble size is large (2‚Äì3 mm), which results in a low interfacial area with a low probability of particle‚Äìbubble contact. In a conventional flotation column, the void fraction is similarly low, and so the probability of particle‚Äìbubble contact is increased by increasing the height of the column to provide greater residence time. Traditionally, the ore slurry and the air are introduced separately to the flotation cell (see Figure 2). The Jameson Cell differs from this traditional approach by mixing the slurry with the air in the downcomers. Figure 3. The Jameson Cell downcomer. The slurry is introduced at the top of the downcomer as a jet that draws in air through a second pipe to form a stable two-phase mixture (see Figure 3). The plunging slurry jet shears and then entrains the air.G Harbort, J Cowburn and E V Manlapig, \\"Recovery interactions between the froth zone, pulp zone and downcomer within a Jameson Cell,\\" in: 10th Australian Coal Preparation Conference, Pokolbin, New South Wales, 17‚Äì21 October 2004 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2004). Accessed: 23 May 2013. The target minerals, with their collector-coated surfaces, attach to the bubbles and this mixture travels down the downcomer, driven by hydrostatic forces,G M Evans, B W Atkinson and G J Jameson, \\"The Jameson Cell,\\" In: Flotation Science and Engineering, Ed.

The downcomer is designed to provide high-intensity mixing of the air and the slurry to generate a dense foam of fine bubbles and maximise the contact between the target mineral particles and the bubbles.G J Jameson and E V Manlapig, \\"Flotation cell design ‚Äì experiences with the Jameson Cell,\\" in: Extractive Metallurgy Conference, Perth, Western Australia, 2‚Äì4 October 1991 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1991), 1‚Äì6. The probability of particle‚Äìbubble contact is \\"virtually 100%\\" with a slurry residence time in the downcomer of 5‚Äì10 seconds. Figure 4. A cut-away drawing showing a typical Jameson Cell design. The high probability of particle‚Äìbubble contact, and subsequent short residence times (five to ten seconds in the downcomer, allows for a much more compact column design than conventional column flotation cells (see Figure 1). The fine nature of the bubbles (0.3 to 0.5 mm in diameter) gives them enhanced carrying capabilities for fine mineral particles. Fine bubbles also improve the separation of minerals, as they intensify the difference in the flotation kinetics of the valuable minerals from the gangue minerals, thus allowing higher grade concentrates to be produced. The foam in the downcomer is about 50‚Äì60% air. Because of this, the pulp is distributed in the form of thin interfacial slurry films between the bubbles, providing an ideal environment for particle‚Äìbubble contact. Collection occurs by migration of the particles within the thin films, which are not much thicker than the diameter of the particles. The best collection occurs when the volume of air roughly equals that of the injected slurry. The Cell is operated by initially closing the air inlet at the top of the downcomer and feeding the flotation pulp in through the nozzle. The air in the downcomer is entrained in the pulp, creating a partial vacuum that draws pulp from the tank up into the downcomer. The pulp level quickly reaches the nozzle, which is at a level above that of the liquid level in the tank. This creates a hydrostatic head in the downcomer, meaning that the pressure inside the top of the downcomer is lower than the atmospheric pressure. When the inlet is opened, air is drawn into the top space of the downcomer by this lower pressure, where it too is entrained into the downcomer contents by the plunging jet. At the same time, a downward flow is established in the pulp in the downcomer that is sufficient to counter the buoyancy of the bubbles, and the aerated pulp discharges into the tank. Once in the tank, the wider cross sectional area of the tank reduces the downward superficial velocity of the mixture, allowing mineral-laden bubbles to disengage from the liquid and rise to the surface as they would in a conventional cell, where they form the froth. The velocity of the mixture discharging into the tank, and the large density differential between it and the remainder of the pulp in the tank, results in recirculating fluid patterns that keep the particles in the tank in suspension without requiring mechanical agitation. The purpose of the tank is simply for bubble‚Äìpulp separation, so the volume of the tank is small compared with alternative technologies. The froth that forms at the top of the tank flows over its lip to be collected. This froth can be \\"washed\\" by a light flow of water, if desired. The bubbles flowing over the lip of the cell are smaller in diameter than those that flow over the lip of conventional flotation columns. The non-floating tailings are discharged through a hole in the bottom of the tank. The Cell has no moving parts and no requirement for compressed air or sparging mechanisms.M F Carretta, J N Graham and W J Dawson, \\"Jameson Cell scale-up experiences at BHP Coal's Goonyella coal preparation plant,\\" Presented at: Coal Prep '97, Lexington, Kentucky, 29 April ‚Äì 1 May 1997. Accessed 29 May 2013. This results in lower power consumption than the equivalent mechanical or column flotation cells. Maintenance costs are also lower because the only wearing part is the slurry lens used to create the jet in the downcomer. History The Jameson Cell grew out of a long-term research program aimed at improving the recovery of fine particles by flotation. The work started at Imperial College London, and continued when Jameson moved in 1978 to the University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia, where he is Laureate Professor (2015). =Academic research (1969‚Äì1990)= Jameson's research into flotation began when he was at Imperial College London, in 1969. A colleague, Dr J. A. Kitchener of the Royal School of Mines, pointed out that many of the new mineral deposits being found around the world required fine grinding to separate the valuable particles from the rock in which they were embedded, and the flotation technologies available at the time were relatively inefficient for recovering fine particles. Kitchener felt that improvements could best be achieved by an increased knowledge of the physics of flotation, rather than the chemistry of the reagents. Jameson had gained some expertise in the properties of bubbles and particles in suspensions whilst a PhD student at Cambridge. He began research into the fluid mechanics of the flotation process and set in train a series of experimental projects into the effect of particle diameter and bubble size on the flotation rate constant. Much of the research was conducted by honours students in chemical engineering. Jameson accepted the challenge of coming up with practical solutions to remedy the situation, if these could be identified. Jameson's research showed that the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameterCollins, G.L. and Jameson, G.J., 1976. Experiments on the flotation of fine particles - the effect of particle size and charge. Chemical Engineering Science 31, 985.Ahmed, N.A. and Jameson, G.J., 1985. The effect of bubble size on the rate of flotation of fine particles, International Journal of Mineral Processing 14, 195-215. and that the way to improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300 microns (Œºm) in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and DavidsonLewis, D.A. and Davidson, J.F., 1982. Bubble splitting in shear flow. Trans IChemE, 60: 283-291. had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in the kitchen sink. If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so there is no need for a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born. After a number of failures, the radical new process for flotation emerged in the laboratory at the University of Newcastle. Jameson filed a provisional patent application in 1986. After an initial trial at the Renison Bell tin mine in Tasmania, certain design features were modified. He led a further plant trial with a small cell in the lead-zinc concentrator at Mt Isa Mines Ltd in Queensland, initially working alone. The plant metallurgists took an interest in the technology and helped to refine it, particularly checking the scale-up procedures that Jameson had devised. In 1988 a recent graduate was assigned full-time for a year to verify and validate the performance of the Cell. In 1989 a worldwide exclusive license was negotiated between Tunra Ltd on behalf of the University of Newcastle, Jameson, and MIM Holdings Limited, for the use of the Cell for metallurgical purposes. Summary papers on the theoryJameson, G.J., 1993. Bubbles in motion, Transactions of the Institution of Chemical Engineers A71, 587-594. and practice have been published. There have been ongoing significant changes to the design of the Cell since it was first developed in the late 1980s. =Trouble in the mill (1980s)= The commercial development of the Cell occurred indirectly as a result of problems being experienced in MIM's Mount Isa lead‚Äìzinc concentrator (sometimes referred to as a \\"mill\\" in the mining industry). MIM had been operating a lead‚Äìzinc concentrator at Mount Isa since 1931,M F Young, J D Pease and K S Fisher, \\"The George Fisher project to increase recovery in the Mount Isa lead/zinc concentrator,\\" in: Seventh Mill Operators' Conference, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, 12‚Äì14 October 2000 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2000), 157‚Äì163. although lead‚Äìzinc ore was substituted with copper ore for a time between mid-1943 and mid-1946.G Blainey, Mines in the Spinifex, (Angus and Robertson: Sydney, 1960), 182‚Äì191. Over time, the lead, zinc and other mineral grains in the ore became progressively finer, the ore grade decreased and it became more difficult to treat.M F Young, J D Pease, N W Johnson and P D Munro, \\"Developments in milling practice at the lead/zinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited from 1990,\\" in: AusIMM Sixth Mill Operators' Conference, Madang, Papua New Guinea, 6‚Äì8 October 1997 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1997), 3‚Äì12. These trends, combined with an increase in the concentrator's throughput, significantly reduced the concentrator's performance in the 1980s, resulting in a \\"tense\\" period of \\"an endless circle of circuit changes, reagent changes, operator changes, metallurgist changes, and so on\\". The decreasing grain size and pushing the grinding circuit beyond its design throughput meant a reduction in the degree of separation of the individual mineral grains (referred to as \\"liberation\\") during grinding. From 1984 to 1991, the liberation of sphalerite (the zinc-bearing mineral, ZnS) decreased from almost 70% to just over 50%. This decrease in liberation resulted in a reduction in the recovery of zinc to saleable zinc concentrate. The initial response to the problem of decreased zinc recovery was in 1986 to start to produce a lower-grade concentrate that was a mixture of zinc and lead (known in the industry as a \\"bulk concentrate\\" and referred to at Mount Isa as the \\"low-grade middlings concentrate\\"). This concentrate typically contained 34% zinc and 13% lead, compared to the normal zinc concentrate composition of at least 50% zinc and less than 3% lead. By producing the bulk concentrate, the total recovery of zinc for sale was maintained at over 70% until 1989. However, the high lead content meant that the bulk concentrate could not be treated by the electrolytic zinc process, and it had to be sold to zinc smelters using the more-expensive Imperial Smelting Process. Initially, MIM received good revenue from its bulk concentrate, but as the nature of the ore continued to deteriorate, the production of the bulk concentrate increased and saturated the market. Payment terms declined until MIM received less than half the payment for zinc in the bulk concentrate than it received for zinc in the zinc concentrate. The problems in the concentrator also affected the performance of MIM's Mount Isa lead smelter.J D Pease, M F Young, C J Greet, N W Johnson and P D Munro, \\"Application of fine grinding to improve galena flotation at the Mt Isa Mines lead/zinc concentrator,\\" presented at: 39th Annual AMIRA Technical Meeting, Adelaide, 11 September 1997. The lead‚Äìzinc ore also contained increasing amounts of fine-grained, carbonaceous pyrite (FeS2). This material was naturally hydrophobic and floated without the aid of a collector into the lead concentrate, diluting it. The additional sulfur from the pyrite in the lead concentrate reduced the lead smelter's lead production because the ability to eliminate sulfur from the concentrate was lead smelter's capacity bottleneck. As part of the effort to try to fix the problems, MIM installed some column flotation cells in the zinc concentrate and bulk concentrate sections of the plant. In those days, the air was introduced into flotation columns using air spargers, usually in the form of a bag or sheath around a pipe. The spargers were high-maintenance items, and their performance was critical to the operation of the column. =Inception and early development (1985‚Äì1990)= Lead and zinc flotation In 1985, MIM commissioned Jameson to undertake a project to improve the sparger design for flotation columns.J A Cowburn, R Stone, S Bourke and B Hill, \\"Design developments of the Jameson Cell,\\" in: Centenary of Flotation Symposium, Brisbane, Queensland, 6‚Äì9 June 2005 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2005), 193‚Äì199. Instead, he developed the concept of using a jet in a downcomer to create the bubbles and eliminate the need for a sparger in conventional flotation columns. The concept of the Cell followed when further investigations showed that most of the bubble‚Äìparticle interactions were occurring in the downcomer, rendering unnecessary the collection zone of flotation columns. The idea of the downcomer and short separation tank was developed and a provisional patent application was lodged in 1986. This patent was later assigned to TUNRA Limited (\\"TUNRA\\"), the technology transfer company of the University of Newcastle that is now known as \\"Newcastle Innovation\\".\\"TUNRA Bulk Solids ‚Äì Who We Are.\\" Accessed 1 June 2013.\\"About Newcastle Innovation.\\" Accessed 1 June 2013. A pilot two tonne per hour (t/h) Jameson Cell with a 100 mm downcomer and using an orifice plate to create the jet was tested in MIM's lead‚Äìzinc concentrator. Subsequently, in 1988, MIM tested the flotation of a stream of fine lead-bearing particles in a conventional mechanical flotation cell, a conventional column and the Jameson Cell. The Cell gave the best recoveries. This was thought to be a combination of the short residence time of the particles in the Cell and the fact that the hydrophobicity of the lead particles decreased over time. As a result of this work, in 1989 MIM ordered four full-scale Cells, two for the Mount Isa lead‚Äìzinc concentrator and another two for the new Hilton lead‚Äìzinc concentrator to be built at the Hilton Mine, located about 20 kilometers north of Mount Isa.P Rohner, \\"Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration practice at the Hilton Concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld,\\" in: Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition, Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993), 504‚Äì507. The Mount Isa cells had diameters of 1.9 m,P D Munro, \\"Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration practice at the lead-zinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld,\\" in: Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition, Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993), 498‚Äì503. with three downcomers each, while those at Hilton were 1.3 m in diameter and had two downcomers each. Coal flotation In parallel with this work, the Cell was tested for the recovery of fine coal at the Newlands coal mine, also owned by MIM Holdings Limited. This fines stream was cyclone overflow, which contained 15‚Äì50% ash and was previously discarded. The particle size of this stream was less than 25 Œºm. Pilot plant testing showed that it was possible to achieve greater than 90% recovery of coal, with less than 10% ash in the product. Subsequently, a full-scale plant was commissioned at Newlands in the 1988‚Äì89 financial year, with six rectangular Cells (1.5 m √ó 3.5 m) installed in a two- stage arrangement. The cells in the first stage had seven downcomers, while those in the second had six. These cells were in continuous operation at Newlands for 15 years until a new washing plant was built to replace the old one in 2006. Two additional Cells were installed at MIM Holdings' Collinsville Coal operations in 1990. These had 10 downcomers each. Copper flotation Also in 1989, Peko Mines, then a division of North Broken Hill Peko Limited, also engaged Jameson to undertake test work in its Warrego concentrator near Tennant Creek in Australia's Northern Territory. The objective was to determine the Jameson Cell's performance in cleaning copper concentrate to improve its grade by removing gangue minerals, including pyrite, magnetite, hematite and quartz. Peko Mines personnel also tested a conventional flotation column for comparison. Following the test work, Peko Mines installed two full-scale, 1.4 m diameter Jameson Cells in the concentrator, each with three downcomers. Peko Mines' decision was based on: * metallurgical performance during pilot plant test work * lower capital expenditure and installation costs * shorter construction and installation times * ease of operation and lower expected maintenance costs. Peko Mines reported a payback on the investment in the Cells of two months. Electrolyte cleaning in solvent extraction ‚Äì electrowinning plants Solvent extraction ‚Äì electrowinning (often referred to as \\"SX‚ÄìEW\\") is a process frequently applied for recovering copper from low-grade and/or oxidised copper ore. It involves leaching the copper from the ore using an acidic solution, collecting the leach liquor containing the copper and contacting this solution with an organic extractant. The copper ions in the leach liquor transfer to the organic extractant, moving from a relatively low concentration to a higher concentration. The extractant is subsequently brought into contact with a second aqueous solution that is more acid than the original leach liquor, and the copper again moves, this time from the extractant into the aqueous solution. The result is an acidic solution of copper in which the copper concentration is high enough for it to be recovered by electrowinning. The solution destined for electrowinning is known as the electrolyte.P Hayes, Process Principles in Minerals & Materials Production (Hayes Publishing Company: Sherwood, Queensland, 1993), 227‚Äì314. The electrolyte solution usually contains traces of the organic extractant that exist as tiny droplets within it.D Readett, \\"Copper recovery by heap leaching, solvent extraction, and electrowinning at Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld,\\" in: Australasian Mining and Metallurgy ‚Äì The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, 2nd Edition (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1993), 721‚Äì725. These need to be removed before the copper can be recovered in the electrowinning process, as the presence of minimal amounts of the extractant can cause difficulties by stripping and damaging the cathodes with a subsequent loss of cathode copper quality.Xstrata Technology, \\"Jameson Cell ‚Äì Rising to the Challenge.\\" In the late 1980s, MIM built an SX‚ÄìEW plant at Mount Isa to recover copper leached from low grade ore stockpiled while mining its Black Rock open cut in the 1960s. In a world first, a Jameson Cell was used to clean the electrolyte solution by removing the remaining organic solvent. This replaced the sand filters traditionally used. The cell was 3 m high, twice the height of the early Cells used in MIM's lead‚Äìzinc concentrators, as it was thought that additional residence time would enhance recovery. It used a single downcomer. The downcomer was used to contact the electrolyte with air and the droplets of the organic extractant attached themselves to the air bubbles created in the downcomer. After some initial modifications to the orifice size, the Cell was able to remove 70‚Äì90% of the entrained organic extractant. Early spread of the technology In April 1989, MIM Holdings Limited acquired the world rights to the Jameson Cell from TUNRA, with TUNRA retaining the rights to use the Cell for waste water treatment. After the initial applications within the MIM Holdings group of companies, the years to 1994 saw Jameson Cells installed by various base and precious metals companies in Asia, South Africa, Canada and the United States, mainly in concentrate cleaning duties, but also in SX‚ÄìEW electrolyte cleaning duties. The installation by Phelps Dodge (now Freeport-McMoRan) for electrolyte cleaning at its Morenci operation in Arizona was notable for having a large cell 6.5 m in diameter with 30 downcomers. The Morenci Jameson Cell consistently recovered over 82% of the organic extractant. Toward the end of the period, Cells were installed in coal preparation plants operated by the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance and by Peabody for fines recovery. Early design developments Improvements to this early design included a focus on the weight and wear of the downcomer. The downcomer was originally built with polyurethane-lined steel, and then changed to a high-density polyethylene (\\"HDPE\\") construction with seven elements. The orifice plate used to generate the slurry jet was a high-wear item and its materials of construction were also a focus of the development effort. After testing high-chromium hardened steel and various ceramics, high-density alumina was found to have excellent wear properties, and it became the standard. =The Mark II Cell (1994‚Äì1999)= Mark II improvements The original Jameson Cell design had the following features: * small (200 mm diameter) downcomers * no wash water * no tailings recycle * no bubble dispersers * low capacity. In 1994 MIM launched the Mark II model Cell. It incorporated the following changes: * the downcomer diameter was increased to 280 mm * wash-water trays were included for froth washing * a tailings recycle system was added to maintain constant downcomer flow and higher recoveries * conical bubble dispersers were added * increased depth of tank from the bottom of the downcomer * increased distance between the downcomers. Figure 5. Drawing of a Jameson Cell fitted with an external tailings recycle mechanism. These changes resulted in a higher capacity design. One of the problems encountered with the Mark I Cell was that its performance was reduced if the feed rate to the cell varied, which was a common occurrence arising from normal fluctuations in operating concentrators. This problem was resolved by recycling some of the tailings to the cell feed via an external splitter box called an \\"External Recycle Mechanism\\" or \\"ERM\\" box separate to the flotation cell. Thus, when the production of the feed stream to the Jameson Cell decreased as a result of a fluctuation elsewhere in the concentrator, a higher percentage of the tailings was automatically recycled to the downcomers, producing a constant flow rate, hence feed pressure, to the cell. This had the added benefit of giving a proportion of the tailings (typically 40%) a second pass through the system, which resulted in higher recoveries. In coal fines flotation, this allowed a single Cell to achieve the same recovery of combustibles as had previously been achieved in some two-stage Cell systems. Subsequently, an internal recycling system, referred to as the \\"internal recycle control\\" or \\"IRC\\" was developed. This was mainly used in integrated rectangular cells (see Figure 6), where the feed tank and tailings recycling system could easily be built in a single unit with the flotation cell. This system reduced the cell installation costs and made the cell more compact. Figure 6. Drawing of a Jameson Cell designed with an internal tailings recycling system. During this period, the orifice diameter was increased from the 28 mm design used in 1990 to 34 mm with the Mark II model and 38 mm in 1997. This, together with the larger Mark II downcomer diameter, allowed the slurry flow per downcomer to be doubled from 30 m3/h in 1990 to 60 m3/h in 1997. The increased distance between the downcomers reduced the interaction of aerated slurry discharging from adjacent downcomers. This interaction could reduce overall cell recovery by causing particles collected by bubbles in the downcomer to detach in the pulp tank. There was significant turbulence in the areas beneath the downcomers. that could result in particles detaching from bubbles. These turbulent areas were calmed by the addition of conical diffusers beneath each downcomer. They allowed uniform bubble rise velocities across the surface of the cell by slowing the superficial gas velocity in the high void-fraction area immediately around the downcomer and provided a more even bubble dispersion. It was reported that the diffusers reduced the turbulence by 69% compared with a standard downcomer with no diffuser. New applications While the JamesonCell continued to expand in base metals concentrate cleaning, SX‚ÄìEW electrolyte cleaning and coal fines recovery applications, it also found new applications in cleaning potash slimesM J Burns, G Coates and L Barnard, \\"Use of Jameson Cell flotation technology at Cleveland Potash Ltd, North Yorkshire, England,\\" Transactions of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (Section C: Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy), May‚ÄìAugust 1994, C162‚ÄìC167. and was adopted by the Philex Mining Corporation as the sole flotation machine for its Benguet copper concentrator.G J Harbort, A S Murphy and A Budod, \\"Jameson Cell developments at Philex Mining Corporation,\\" in: AusIMM Sixth Mill Operators' Conference, Madang, Papua New Guinea, 6‚Äì8 October 1997 (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1997), 105‚Äì113. This is not the normal application for the Cell. No other metals concentrator operates solely using Jameson Cells. =Potash flotation= Cleveland Potash Limited extracts and refines sylvinite ore from a deposit in North Yorkshire, England. Its processing plant uses froth flotation to produce a product rich in potassium chloride (\\"KCl\\"). After a test work campaign in which it compared the performance of the Cell with mechanical flotation cells in various duties in the flotation circuit, Cleveland Potash ordered a Cell with 6 downcomers for recovering potash slimes. The test work had shown a 4.8% increase in the recovery of potash slimes, equivalent at the time to an increase in revenue of approximately ¬£518,000 per year. =Copper rougher flotation= In 1993 Philex Mining Corporation, a Philippines mining company, replaced the mechanical cleaner circuit with Cells at its Benguet copper concentrator. Following their successful operation, Philex replaced the mechanical cells in its cleaner-scavenger circuit in 1994 and began the phased introduction of Cell rougher and scavenger lines that was completed in early 1996. This was the first operation in which the external recycle mechanism system was applied. By the time the last Jameson Cell was installed, the entire flotation circuit was composed of Jameson Cells. The motivation for installing Jameson Cells was, in part, to take advantage of their space-saving capabilities and to improve copper recovery at a minimum cost. The Cell circuit occupied 60% less floor area and achieved equivalent results to the mechanical banks with 40% of their residence time. They provided a power saving of 18%. In addition to these benefits, the use of the Jameson Cells in the rougher and rougher‚Äìscavenger section of the plant resulted in a 3.3% increase in copper recovery and a 4.5% increase in gold recovery. When combined with the other Cells in the cleaner, recleaner and cleaner‚Äìscavenger section, there was a 2.6% increase in final copper concentrate grade and a 3.5% increase in plant copper recovery, with a 2.6% increase in plant gold recovery. =The Mark III Cell (2000‚Äì2008)= Mark III improvements Figure 7. The Jameson Cell Mark IV slurry lens. The Mark III design encompassed the greatest improvement in the technology since its commercialisation. The focus was to make the technology more robust and easier to use in operations. The total redesign of the downcomer assembly allowed it to be isolated and unblocked much more easily compared to the Mark II design. The Mark III design also saw slurry flow per downcomer to be increased from 60 m3/h to 75‚Äì85 m3/h using larger orifice sizes in the slurry lenses.Personal communication, L Huynh, Jameson Cell Manager, Xstrata Technology. The Mark III Cell was introduced in 2000. It included the following improvements: * a new slurry lens orifice design (see Figures 7 and 8) * a new design downcomer and nozzle * a new design flat plate bubble dispersers * a stainless steel adjustable above and in-froth wash water system (see Figure 9) * automated air and wash water flow control * air- isolating slurry-eliminating valves (\\"AISE valves\\") * a bottom-fed new slurry distributor. Figure 8. A Jameson Cell slurry lens being inserted into the top of a downcomer. The earlier models of the Jameson Cell used orifice plates to generate the downcomer jet. The new slurry lens design had a smooth, shallow entry angle that created an optimum flow regime over the ceramic, reducing wear and extending its life. The shape resulted in a decrease in power consumption by the feed slurry pump by up to 10% and resulted in better jet formation that improved air entrainment. Figure 9. A stainless-steel wash water system fitted to a Jameson Cell being used for floating coal fines. For coal applications, the wash water addition system was changed from a tray to stainless-steel circular rings attached to a manual lifting system. This allowed the flexibility of an easy transition from above-froth wash water addition to the in-froth addition that might be necessary for high concentrate-grade operations. For metals applications, new design wash water trays consisting of removable rubber mats for easy maintenance were used. The AISE valves were developed to prevent solids being sucked back into the air lines when individual downcomers become blocked. Solids depositing in the air lines and their build up in the air distributor decreases flotation performance as it prevents air from being efficiently entrained in the downcomers. New applications This period was one of rapid growth for the Jameson Cells in the existing applications. Seventy-seven Cells were installed in concentrators around the world, mainly in coal and base metal operations. However, during this time, the Cell also moved into the Canadian oil sands industry for the flotation of bitumen. =Bitumen flotation= Flotation is one of the unit processes used to separate the bituminous component of oil sands as part of the process of oil extraction.O Neiman, B Hilscher and R Siy, \\"Secondary recovery of bitumen using Jameson downcomers,\\" in: Proceedings of the 44th Canadian Mineral Processors Operators Conference, Ottawa, Ontario, 17‚Äì19 January 2012 (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum), 115‚Äì124. Accessed 24 May 2013. Some of the bitumen is not recovered in the primary separation vessel and reports to the tailings. These tailings are typically retreated in a scavenging operation to try to recover some of the remaining bitumen. Three industrial-size single downcomer Jameson Cells were sold by Xstrata Technology to Shell Canada in 2007 for a large scale pilot plant project and eight 500 mm downcomers were sold to Syncrude Limited in 2008. In the latter case, the downcomers were used to treat middlings in an existing tertiary oil recovery vessel in a bitumen recovery process patented by Syncrude. =The Mark IV Cell (2009‚Äì )= Mark IV improvements Figure 10. Photograph of the quick-release clamps used to attach the slurry line to the top of the Jameson Cell downcomer. The Mark IV Cell design was introduced in 2009. It included the following improvements: * a flexible hose for easier alignment of the downcomer * clamping of the slurry lens onto the downcomer (see Figure 10) * stainless steel quick-release clamps in the downcomer assembly * long-lasting rubber flaps in the AISE valves. Current applications =Base and precious metals flotation= In base and precious metals flotation, the Jameson Cell has established itself as being particularly useful in several applications in flotation circuits that also use other types of flotation cells, such as mechanical cells. These applications include: * preflotation roughers for removing naturally hydrophobic gangue materialsXstrata Technology, Jameson Cell brochure. Accessed 2 July 2013.

In this application, the recovery in one Jameson Cell is normally equivalent to several mechanical cells, and where the feed contains fast-floating liberated particles, the Cell can produce final-grade product, thus reducing the number of mechanical cells required in a flotation circuitD Curry, M Cooper, J Rubenstein, T Shouldice and M Young, \\"The right tools in the right place: how Xstrata Nickel Australasia increased Ni throughput at its Cosmos plant,\\" in: Proceedings of the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Canadian Mineral Processors, Ottawa, Ontario, 19‚Äì21 January 2010 (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum), 215‚Äì234. * cleaner-scalper duties, in which the Jameson Cell recovers fast floating minerals to produce a final-grade concentrate, thus reducing the load on the rest of the cleaning circuit and reducing its size.

For example, at BHP Coal's Goonyella mine (now part of the BHP Mitsubishi Alliance) eight Cells were installed to replace the entire 32 mechanical cell flotation circuit in 1995 in its 1800 t/h coal flotation plant. The result was an overall increase in yield for the plant of 3.5% (better than the predicted yield of 2.1% that was used to justify the project) and the production of a low-ash product. Since then, Jameson Cells have been installed in many coal preparation plants around the world, with the largest installation at the Curragh coal mine in Australia, where 12 Cells treat over 5 million t/y of coal fines. The Cell can also be applied to coal preparation plant tailings to recover fine coal previously discarded. =SX‚ÄìEW plants= The Jameson Cell is used to recover the organic solvent in solvent extraction ‚Äì electrowinning plants from both the electrolyte and raffinate streams. Contamination of the electrolyte increases operating costs and reduces the quality of the copper product. Any solvent remaining in the raffinate stream represents a loss of solvent and hence an increase in operating costs. Major users of the Cell in SX‚ÄìEW plants include Freeport McMoRan at its Morenci operations, BHP Billiton at its Olympic Dam operations and Grupo M√©xico at its Cananea and La Caridad operations. In all, Xstrata Technology reports 41 SX‚ÄìEW applications. Recent developments in the Cell design for SX‚ÄìEW applications include large, flat- bottomed cell design to allow it to sit on the ground and large (500 mm diameter) downcomers that can have multiple liquor (there being no slurry in SX‚ÄìEW applications) lenses fitted to each downcomer. The biggest operating Cell is at the Olympic Dam operations, treating 3000 m3/h of raffinate. =Potash= The first potash application was in England in 1993, where Jameson Cells were used to treat potash slimes (see Potash flotation). It has subsequently been applied at Israel Chemicals Limited's Dead Sea Works and by an unnamed producer in the Saskatchewan province of Canada. =Oil sands= The Jameson Cell has been adopted by Shell Canada and Syncrude for floating bitumen in the oil sands industry (see Bitumen flotation). Syncrude bought an additional eight 500 mm downcomers for its plant in 2012. =Iron ore= The Jameson Cell can be used for the reverse flotation of silica from iron ore, where flotation columns have traditionally been used. =Phosphate flotation= Phosphate processing operations that use flotation as the principal mechanism to concentrate the phosphate-bearing minerals usually discard particles smaller than 20 Œºm in diameter. This is because the fine particles have had poor flotation performance and because their presence decreases the flotation performance of the coarse particles. Legend International Holdings Incorporated (\\"Legend\\") owns major phosphate deposits that average 20‚Äì60% particles less than 20 Œºm that contain up to 50% of the phosphate. This makes the traditional phosphate concentration practice uneconomic for these deposits. In response, Legend developed a process based on using the Jameson Cell in a rougher-scavenger-cleaner configuration to recover at least 80% of the phosphate at a grade of at least 32% P2>O5 from a feed with a particle size distribution of up to 80% less than 20 Œºm. Advantages  The Jameson Cell reportedly has the following advantages: * relatively low energy use ‚Äì the only energy that is required to operate the Cell is to pump the slurry through the slurry lens. This means that it requires significantly less electricity than conventional mechanical or column flotation cells. In addition, the better particle‚Äìbubble contact means that fewer Cells are required for the equivalent duty of mechanical cells, giving an even bigger power saving. * high recovery of fines ‚Äì The Cell is able to achieve final product specification from previously discarded coal fines at very high recoveries (95‚Äì98%) in a single pass. It has also been shown to be effective in recovering fine particles in base metals, potash and phosphate applications. * effective froth washing ‚Äì The Cell uses froth washing as standard to control concentrate grade. A conventional flotation cell has problems with recovering fine particles at high grades due to the entrainment of gangue minerals in the froth. The high throughput of the Jameson Cell means that the froth is produced in a small surface area so it is economic to apply froth washing to all cells * easily scaled up ‚Äì the hydrodynamic conditions for particle collection inside the downcomer and separation in the tank are identical between the laboratory, pilot plant and industrial-scale Jameson Cell, meaning that there is direct scale-up. This makes predicting plant performance for small-scale tests straightforward.Xstrata Technology, \\"Accurate design and scale-up.\\" Accessed 9 June 2013. In contrast, factors have to be used to scale-up the design of mechanical and column flotation cells. * relatively small footprint ‚Äì the high intensity of bubble-particle contact means that very low residence times are required in the Cell (residence time in the downcomer is 5‚Äì10 seconds and the separation tank volume is small compared with alternative technologies). This means that the total volume of the Cell is lower than the alternatives. * fast response to process changes ‚Äì process variables such as air flow rate, froth depth and wash water are all automated making optimisation straightforward.Xstrata Technology, \\"Easy to tune ‚Äì quick to respond.\\" Accessed 1 July 2013. The small tank volumes means very short residence times in the tank (typically 1‚Äì3 minutes) so changes made, whether they are deliberate or from normal plant fluctuations, are observed almost instantly. * rapid start-up and shutdown ‚Äì the small volume of the tank means that the Cell can be filled and drained quickly so with plant upsets the Cell can reach steady state very quickly. * low maintenance costs ‚Äì the Cell has no moving parts and is designed to provide easy access to serviceable parts. The slurry lens orifice has a service life exceeding 5 years under normal operating conditions and the service life of the other wet-end wear parts is reported to be over 10 years under normal operating conditions.Xstrata Technology, \\"Minimal Maintenance ‚Äì High Availability.\\" Accessed 7 June 2013. * low capital cost ‚Äì the small footprint of the Cell reduces the amount of steel required in its construction and, coupled with the simplicity of its design, has lower installation costs when compared with conventional or column flotation cells. * low operating costs ‚Äì the lack of moving parts with a consequent lower power consumption, long wear life and easy access results in low operating costs. * short payback periods ‚Äì Cell users typically report short payback periods for their investments in the technology. For example, the 2007 installation of a 5.4 m diameter Jameson Cell with 18 downcomers to treat preflotation concentrate recovered up to 90% of the zinc previously lost to the tailings disposal facility and had a payback of approximately one year at the zinc prices of the day. Peko Mines reported a payback period of two months for its Cell installation. The complete replacement of 32 mechanical cells with eight Jameson Cells at the Goonyella coal mine had a payback of 17 months. More recently, the installation of a Cell ahead of each of two cleaner trains at the Telfer Mine had a payback of between two and seven months.

Operations IHE created and operates a process through which interoperability of health care IT systems can be improved. The group gathers case requirements, identifies available standards, and develops technical guidelines which manufacturers can implement. IHE also stages \\"connectathons\\" and \\"interoperability showcases\\" in which vendors assemble to demonstrate the interoperability of their products. and so all Sponsorship IHE is sponsored by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA), and the American College of Cardiology (ACC). The eye care domain is sponsored by the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Projects IHE integration profiles describe a clinical information need or workflow scenario and document how to use established standards to accomplish it. A group of systems that implement the same integration profile address the need/scenario in a mutually compatible way. For example, the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standards specify many different formats for image data. A given set of images that might comply with some optional parts of the standards might still not be accepted by an application in use by a particular radiologist. Profiles reduce the chances of these incompatibilities. The Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC) standard codes for use in databases are often used in IHE profiles. A model for cross-enterprise document sharing called XDS allows hospitals to share electronic records that use the Health Level 7 (HL7) standards and LOINC codes. The United States Department of Veterans Affairs revised its plans in 1999 to adopt IHE recommendations. IHE integration statements are prepared and published by a vendor to list the IHE profiles supported by a specific release of a specific product. IHE technical frameworks are detailed documents which specify the integration profiles and associated actors (systems) and transactions. IHE connectathons are annual events where equipment vendors bring products with IHE profiles and test them with other vendors. The events are held in Europe, USA, Korea, Japan and Australia.

The show is inspired by the eponymous 1996 film, which was written and directed by the Coen brothers. The Coens were impressed by Hawley's script and agreed to be named as executive producers. The series premiered on April 15, 2014, on FX, and follows an anthology format, with each season set in a different era and location, with a different story and mostly new characters and cast, although there is minor overlap. Each season is heavily influenced by various Coen brothers films, with each containing numerous references to them. The first season, set in Minnesota and North Dakota in 2006 and starring Billy Bob Thornton, Allison Tolman, Colin Hanks, and Martin Freeman, received wide acclaim from critics. It won the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Miniseries, Outstanding Directing, and Outstanding Casting, and received 15 additional nominations including Outstanding Writing, another Outstanding Directing nomination, and acting nominations for all four leads. It also won the Golden Globe Awards for Best Miniseries or Television Film and Best Actor ‚Äì Miniseries or Television Film for Thornton. The second season, set in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota in 1979 and starring Kirsten Dunst, Patrick Wilson, Jesse Plemons, Jean Smart, and Ted Danson, received widespread critical acclaim. It received three Golden Globe nominations, along with several Emmy nominations including Outstanding Miniseries, and acting nominations for Dunst, Plemons, Smart, and Bokeem Woodbine. The third season, set in Minnesota in 2010 and starring Ewan McGregor, Carrie Coon, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Goran Bogdan, and David Thewlis, premiered on April 19, 2017. Like previous seasons, it was met with acclaim from critics, and received Emmy nominations including Outstanding Miniseries, and acting nominations for McGregor, Coon, and Thewlis. It received three Golden Globe nominations, for Outstanding Limited Series, and McGregor and Thewlis for acting, with McGregor winning in his category. The fourth season, set in Kansas City, Missouri in 1950 and starring Chris Rock, Jessie Buckley, Jason Schwartzman, Ben Whishaw, and Jack Huston, premiered on September 27, 2020. Series overview =Season 1 (2014)= In 2006, Lorne Malvo (Billy Bob Thornton) passes through Bemidji, Minnesota, and influences the community ‚Äì including put-upon insurance salesman Lester Nygaard (Martin Freeman) ‚Äì with his malice, violence, and deception. Meanwhile, Deputy Molly Solverson (Allison Tolman) and Duluth police officer Gus Grimly (Colin Hanks) team up to solve a series of murders they believe may be linked to Malvo and Nygaard. =Season 2 (2015)= In 1979, beautician Peggy Blumquist (Kirsten Dunst) and her husband, butcher Ed Blumquist (Jesse Plemons) of Luverne, Minnesota, cover up her hit-and-run and murder of Rye Gerhardt (Kieran Culkin), son of Floyd Gerhardt (Jean Smart), matriarch of the Gerhardt crime family in Fargo, North Dakota. Meanwhile, State Trooper Lou Solverson (Patrick Wilson) and his father-in-law, Sheriff Hank Larsson (Ted Danson), investigate a triple homicide at a local diner connected to Rye. =Season 3 (2017)= In 2010, St. Cloud probation officer Ray Stussy (Ewan McGregor) and his parolee girlfriend Nikki Swango (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) dream of a better, wealthier life. To achieve this, they attempt to steal a valuable vintage stamp from Ray's more successful older brother, Emmit (also played by McGregor), the self-proclaimed \\"Parking Lot King of Minnesota\\". However, their plans backfire, and the couple soon has to hide their involvement in two deaths, including the stepfather of former Eden Valley police chief Gloria Burgle (Carrie Coon). Meanwhile, Emmit wishes to pay back a shady company he borrowed money from two years ago, but the mysterious company and its employees, led by V. M.

Set in Brainerd shortly after the events of the film, it starred Edie Falco as Marge Gunderson and Bruce Bohne reprising his role as Officer Lou. It was directed by Kathy Bates and featured no involvement from the Coen brothers. The episode aired in 2003 during Trio's Brilliant But Cancelled series of failed TV shows. In 2012, it was announced that FX, with the Coen brothers as executive producers, was developing a new television series based on the 1996 Academy Award-winning film Fargo. It was later announced that adaptation would be a ten-episode limited series. On August 2, 2013, it was announced that Billy Bob Thornton had signed on to star in the series. On September 27, 2013, Martin Freeman also signed on to star. On October 3, 2013, it was announced that Colin Hanks was cast in the role of Duluth police officer Gus Grimly. Production began in late 2013 with filming taking place in and around Calgary, Alberta. The series is set in the same fictional universe as the film, in which events took place in 1987 between Minneapolis and Brainerd, Minnesota. The first season features the buried ransom money from the film in a minor subplot. Additionally, a number of references are made connecting the series to the film. Following the series renewal in July 2014, creator Noah Hawley revealed that the second season would take place in 1979 and focus on Sioux Falls, South Dakota, as referred to by Lou Solverson and others in the first season. The ten episodes are set in Luverne, Minnesota, Fargo, North Dakota, and Sioux Falls. Hawley agreed that this takes place before the events of the film, but he believes all the stories connect: \\"I like the idea that somewhere out there is a big, leather- bound book that's the history of true crime in the Midwest, and the movie was Chapter 4, Season 1 was Chapter 9 and this is Chapter 2,\\" he said. \\"You can turn the pages of this book, and you just find this collection of stories. ... But I like the idea that these things are connected somehow, whether it's linearly or literally or thematically. That's what we play around with.\\" This book was realized in season 2, episode 9, \\"The Castle\\". Production on the second season began in Calgary on January 19, 2015, and completed on May 20, 2015. The first teaser for the second season was released on June 17, 2015. Production on season 3 began in January 2017 in Calgary, Alberta. Production on the fourth season was shut down in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The season was originally scheduled to premiere on April 19, 2020, before the shutdown. Filming resumed on the fourth season in late August 2020. \\"This is a true story\\" As with the original film, each episode begins with the superimposed text: As with the film, this claim is untrue.

Challenges The established dealers face intense competition from imported second-hand vehicles, mainly from Japan and United Arab Emirates. Another issue is that there is more demand for second-hand vehicles rather than new ones because Kenya is generally a low-income country. Thus, Mobius Motors was established to provide low cost cars at about KES. 1,100,000 (US$11,000). In the beginning of 2019, the Government of Kenya proposed to implement a National Automotive Policy which effectively would see an eventual ban on imports of second hand passenger and commercial vehicles. However, this was faced with stiff resistance from the used car industry with the government eventually having to suspend their push to change the regulations on the 7th of May 2019.

The mass migration into India since Bangladesh independence has led to the creation of anti-foreigner movements, instances of mass violence and political tension between Bangladesh and India, but it has also created measurable economic benefits for both nations. Estimates of the number of Bangladeshis in India vary widely. A census carried out in 2001 by the Indian government estimated there were 3.1 million Bangladeshis residing in India, based on place of birth and place of last residence. A different 2009 estimate claimed that there were 15 million Bangladeshis who had taken residence in the country. In 2012 Mullappally Ramachandran, the minister of state for home claimed that nearly 1.4 Million Bangladeshi migrants entered India in the last decade alone. . Pre partition ‚Äì 1970s Before the Partition of India internal migration was commonplace between the region which is now Bangladesh and the regions of Assam and West Bengal. While under colonial rule Assam was sparsely populated and the British, who wanted to exploit the resources from the region wished to see it settled. Through internal migration labour was brought from the northern regions of India, West Bengal and the region which now comprises Bangladesh. During the Bangladesh liberation war it is estimated that up to 10 million people fled from East Pakistan to India so as to escape the genocidal actions being carried out by the West Pakistan armed forces. There were outbreaks of cholera throughout the refugee camps, the World Health Organization estimated 51,000 cases and it is estimated that 3000 people died from the disease. Ease of illegal immigration According to a commentator, the trip to India from Bangladesh is one of the cheapest in the world, costing around Rs. 2000 (around $30 US), which includes the fee for the \\"Tour Operator\\". As Bangladeshis are culturally similar to the Bengali people in India, they are able to pass off as Indian citizens and settle down in any part of India to establish a future, for a very small price. This false identity, bolstered with false documentation available for as little as Rs. 200 ($3 US). Anti-immigrant reaction In 1978, observers noticed the names of an estimated 45,000 Bengali illegal immigrants on the electoral rolls in Assam. This led to a popular movement against undocumented immigrants known as the Assam Movement, which insisted on striking the names of illegal immigrants from the electoral register and advocated for their deportation from the state. The movement demanded that anyone who had entered the state illegally since 1951 be deported, though the central government insisted on a cutoff date of 1971. There was widespread support for the movement, though it tapered off between 1981 and 1982. Toward the end of 1982 the central government called elections, and the Assam Movement called for people to boycott them. This resulted in the 1983 Nellie massacre, described by Antara Datta, as one of the largest and most severe pogroms since the Second World War. Previously, the All Assam Students Union (AASU) had emphasised economic reasons for the protests and had employed only nonviolent methods. The Nellie massacre, a result of a buildup of resentment over immigration, claimed the lives of at least 2,191 people, though unofficial figures run to more than 5,000. No investigation of the incident has ever been launched. The AASU denied any involvement in the massacre, and since then there have been no instances of communal violence in Upper Assam.  False Estimates of Bangladeshis in India  Samir Guha Roy of the Indian Statistical Institute called the government estimates of illegal Bangladeshis \\"motivatedly exaggerated\\". After examining the population growth and demographic statistics, Roy instead states that a significant numbers of internal migration is sometimes falsely thought to be illegal immigrants. An analysis of the numbers by Roy revealed that on average around 91000 Bangladeshi nationals might have crossed over to India every year during the years 1981‚Äì1991 but how many of them where identified and pushed back is not known. It is possible that a large portion of these immigrants returned on their own to their place of origin. Most of the Bengali speaking people deported from Maharashtra as illegal immigrants are originally Indian citizens from West Bengal. In Assam, Muslims are usually targeted by the protesters, being branded as illegal immigrants, \\"though many have lived in the region for generations\\". There were also reports of harassment of Muslims in the char areas by policemen despite submitting proof of citizenship. In 2004, Sriprakash Jaiswal, India's minister of state for home affairs, stated in the Indian parliament that, there were 12 million illegal Bangladeshis in the country, of whom 5 million were in Assam, as of 31 December 2001. However, according to Prateek Hajela, the NRC's coordinator in Assam, the number of identified illegal immigrants in the state were \\"in thousands\\" after covering a third of the total population in 2016.

The Opera House, opened by Lillie Langtry in 1900, and the Jersey Arts Centre are the main performance spaces, although performances also take place in parish halls and other venues. History La Ruette de la Com√©die in Saint Helier recalls the location of Jersey's first dedicated theatre building On 14 November 1778 the States of Jersey adopted an Act forbidding the staging of stage plays or farces without the prior permission of the Bailiff and Royal Court. This legislation remains the basis of the current licensing of public entertainment in Jersey: public entertainment, including stage works, is licensed by the Bailiff (advised by the Bailiff's Panel for the Control of Public Entertainment). The fact that the States deemed it necessary to pass such an Act suggests that theatrical performances were at that time frequent enough and of sufficient concern to the authorities to require the setting up of a regulatory system. However, there is little direct evidence of which plays were being performed as there were at that time no established theatre and no newspapers. During the 16th and 17th centuries as drama developed in France and England, culture in Jersey was controlled by a strict Calvinist r√©gime, and even the imposition of Anglicanism after 1660 did not alter the basic attitudes to entertainment in Jersey. Sitting between the cultural poles of France and England, Jersey was further isolated by the language situation. Visiting theatre troupes from England would not have been understood by the J√®rriais speaking population, and French troupes were deterred by the frequent states of war or suspicion that existed between France and England during this period. The language question continued to impede the development of theatre even once theatres had become established, as commented upon by Henry David Inglis in 1834. The Long Room (as remodelled) on the first floor above the corn market (now the registry office) survives as a clubroom. The first location known to have been used as a theatre in Jersey is the Long Room above the Corn Market in the Royal Square, Saint Helier. This was described as \\"La salle de la com√©die\\" in La Gazette de l'√éle de Jersey of 23 March 1788. This assembly room had been used for public presentations before, including meetings addressed to crowds of between 500 and 600 people by John Wesley on 28 and 29 August 1787. Before 1788 it appears that acting was an amateur pastime, and that the States were concerned that young men were spending too much time in idle distractions. The first specific record of a particular troupe of actors is of an amateur club of 12 gentleman in 1786 proposing to present a season of plays by famous playwrights. The first record of a professional theatre company in Jersey is the visit of a French troupe under a man named Desroches which performed in Jersey between March and May 1788 ‚Äì the last visit by a French theatrical company until after the end of the Napoleonic Wars. Desroches' company performed L'Amant bourru (by Monvel) and Le M√©decin malgr√© lui (by Moli√®re) in one programme on 25 March 1788 ‚Äì the first plays known by name to have been performed in Jersey. English theatre companies visited in the summers of 1792 and 1793. The first English-language play known to have been performed in Jersey was The West Indian by Richard Cumberland on 5 May 1792, followed, amongst others, by The School for Scandal by Richard Brinsley Sheridan on 12 May 1792 and Douglas by John Home on 26 May 1792. The first plays recorded by name to have been performed by amateurs were Alzire and M√©rope by Voltaire, in French, in 1795 and 1796. 30 July 1796: Mrs Lee advertises a performance of the (unidentified) Th√©√¢tre Royal, Saint Helier Between 1792 and 1796 there were plays advertised as being performed at the \\"Th√©√¢tre Royal\\". It is not known whether this refers to the Long Room, but the description of a gallery suggests that this might be a different building unless the Long Room had been altered during this period. Plays were also performed in the 1790s outside Saint Helier. The annual midsummer fair in Saint John attracted huge crowds and the English companies of Fisher and Henry Lee are known to have performed in tents there in 1793 and 1795. The Saint John's fair and its entertainments became such an annoyance to the authorities that it was suppressed by Act of the States in 1797. The first identifiable dedicated theatre space in Jersey was opened in 1802 (not counting the unidentified \\"Th√©√¢tre Royal\\" which appears not to refer to the same building) by James Shatford, proprietor of the Salisbury theatre, to house his visiting English company. It consisted of a converted barn in what now bears the English name of Regent Road and the French name of Ruette de la Com√©die in Saint Helier. The French name preserves the memory of the existence of this theatre. Few records survive to give an idea of the layout or appearance of this theatre which was named \\"The Theatre Royal\\", but it was described in 1809 as being \\"neat and sufficiently extensive\\". Shatford's company were not in permanent residence; in their absence performances were staged by officers of the British regiments garrisoned in Jersey, under the title of \\"Garrison Theatricals\\". These performances were open to the public, and raised money for the relief of poor British prisoners of war in France during the Napoleonic Wars. Once the wars were over, the theatre was used intermittently by both English and French visiting troupes but with little financial success. This theatre was superseded in 1828; the fabric survived until demolition in 1947. Advertisement for the programme at the Theatre Royal, Jersey: 5 July 1828. Included in the bill: The Belle's Stratagem On 5 May 1828 a new theatre was opened in Royal Crescent, Saint Helier. This theatre was also named the \\"Theatre Royal\\" and was Jersey's first purpose-built theatre. The opening production was A New Way to Pay Old Debts. A backdrop painted to depict a panoramic view of the entrance of Saint Helier Harbour and the whole of St Aubin's Bay from the viewpoint of Fort Regent was particularly admired on opening night. In 1834 the newspaper Le Constitutionnel stated that the owners of the theatre had never broken even. Also in 1834 Henry D. Inglis described the situation as follows: :\\"There is a theatre indeed; and there are winter assemblies: but the latter are few in number; and not particularly attractive; and as for the former, there is so little encouragement given to the drama in Jersey, that the company is most commonly indifferent. The native inhabitants do not sufficiently understand the English language, to relish English drama; and the residents are not rich enough to afford of themselves, sufficient encouragement to the theatre. It must also be admitted, that naval and military men, are not those amongst whom a taste for the drama is most likely to be found. Companies of French actors, however, are tolerably well supported by the native inhabitants.\\" The Theatre Royal in Royal Crescent burnt down on 31 July 1863. It took two years for a new theatre to be built: Henry Cornwall opened the Royal Amphitheatre in Gloucester Street on 17 April 1865. This theatre was sold to Wybert Rousby in 1869, and became known as the Theatre Royal, and later as the Theatre Royal and Opera House. In April 1891 Lillie Langtry made her first appearance in a Jersey theatre at the Theatre Royal. Fire broke out in the night of 29 March 1899, destroying the building. A new theatre on the ruins of the Theatre Royal and Opera House. The Opera House was opened by Lillie Langtry on 9 July 1900, who performed in the first play produced in the new premises, The Degenerates. A fire on 12 May 1921 partly destroyed the building, requiring reconstruction. The Opera House, which had been showing films in alternation with live entertainment, became a dedicated cinema in 1931, leaving Springfield Hall as the main venue for theatrical entertainment. The Mystery of Edwin Drood presented by the Jersey Dickens Players, 1916 Edward Clarence \\"Teddy\\" Boielle (1872‚Äì1941) abandoned a less than successful business career for a career in entertainment. He brought concert parties to Jersey, was a key organiser of the Coronation celebrations for Edward VII and George V, noted especially for his part in the organisation of the inaugural Jersey Battle of Flowers, was stage manager of the Caesarean Operatic and Dramatic Society. Boielle also performing as the title r√¥le in The Mikado, as Sir Joseph Porter in HMS Pinafore, Bunthorne in Patience, Mr Pockett in The Magistrate and others. He was founding Secretary of the Jersey Eisteddfod. He dramatised Charles Dickens' The Haunted Man for the Saint Helier's Church Literary Society (another of Dean Samuel Falle's cultural projects besides the Jersey Eisteddfod) in 1908 and staged it at the Oddfellows' Hall in Saint Helier in December 1908, followed by two public performances in January 1909. The success of these performances persuaded cast and author-director to form a regular company for the production of an annual Dickens stage adaptation: 1909‚Äì1910 The Chimes; 1910‚Äì1911 The Battle of Life; 1911‚Äì1912 The Cricket on the Hearth; 1912‚Äì1913 The Christmas Carol; 1913‚Äì1914 a revival of The Haunted Man; 1914 Scenes from Pickwick; 1915 The Chimes; 1916 Edwin Drood; 1917 The Battle of Life; 1918 The Old Curiosity Shop; 1919 The Cricket on the Hearth; 1921 Oliver Twist. The Oddfellows' Hall was then turned into a cinema, and the Dickens Players moved to the Opera House for their final productions: 1922 a revival of The Christmas Carol; 1924 David Copperfield. E.C. Boielle's commitments as manager of Wests Picture House and competition from new forms of entertainment led to the suspension of the annual Dickens dramatisations, but members of the amateur troupe moved on to other associations. The Play House Apartments preserve part of the Art Deco fa√ßade (dated 1937) of the former Playhouse theatre Besides the Oddfellows' Hall, among the smaller halls used for staged performances at this time was the Cercle St Thomas in New Street, Saint Helier. Originally built in 1819 as the Albion Baptist Chapel, it was acquired in 1842 for use by the French- speaking Roman Catholic congregation as a chapel dedicated to Saint Thomas, in which function it continued until the construction of the large Saint Thomas's Church nearby in 1887 left the chapel redundant. It found new use as a Catholic clubroom with billiard tables and a stage for performances. The Cercle St Thomas building was modernised in 1908 and equipped for showing films. The Jersey Entertainment Society commissioned CW Blanshard Bolton, architect, in 1935 to enlarge the building to house a new theatre. The striking new Art Deco frontage of the New Playhouse was revealed in 1938, and from then until the outbreak of the Second World War a repertory theatre was operated, mostly by actors and crew from England, including Laurence Naismith and Donald Pleasence. In 1946 the Denville Players, a repertory company from England led by Len Laurie and Marjorie Denville, took a lease of the Playhouse from the Brotherhood of Saint Thomas. Laurie and Denville had honeymooned in Jersey in 1925, had liked the Island so much that they returned to perform summer season in the 1930s and only escaped from being stranded during the Occupation by the fact they had refused the offer of the 1939 season. They returned to make their home in Jersey in 1946. They operated the Playhouse theatre until 1963 when the Brotherhood sold the building and it was converted to a retail store. =Theatre during the German Occupation (1940‚Äì1945)= The problem of providing entertainment and maintaining morale under the German Occupation was tackled by Jersey's amateur dramatic societies. The Jersey Opera House, which had been run as a cinema before the war, Wests Picture House, parish halls, church halls and other venues were used for theatrical entertainment. The Playhouse was taken over by the Germans for food storage. By the beginning of 1941 a number of productions were nearing readiness but there was uncertainty as to which company would take the initiative. The Opera House reopened on 6 January 1941 with the Jersey Amateur Dramatic Club's production of Housemaster by Ian Hay, followed on 17 February with a production by the Green Room Club of \\"The Light of Heart\\" by Emlyn Williams. A pattern of a new play or theatrical production (revue, variety) every other week was quickly established as associations, such as the Green Room Club, the Amateur Dramatic Club, the Island School of Dancing and Elocution, and the Fifty-Fifty Club, rallied to keep morale up and provide alternative entertainment under conditions of shortage of films and the banning and confiscation of radios. Times of curtain up varied according to the curfew imposed; on occasion when the population were collectively punished for acts of resistance by earlier curfews, the curtain had to rise as early as 6pm. The electricity supply became increasingly erratic. The Opera House was forced to resort to improvised lighting consisting of 3 car headlights in the orchestra pit and lights powered by car batteries in the wings, a system also put into effect at other halls. Appreciation for the actors' efforts were frequently expressed in the form of gifts from audience members in the form of supplements to rations, such as potato flour, sugar beet syrup, butter and other provisions. Scripts were subject to arbitrary German censorship: innocent remarks were struck out, while blatantly patriotic statements were sometimes passed without objection. The mention of \\"red, white and blue\\" was forbidden, and the wearing of military uniforms on stage was prevented. A production of The Merchant of Venice was considered insufficiently anti- Semitic, and the lead actor was summoned by the censor and ordered to act more Jewish and with more venom. Remarks that had been censored were occasionally put back in when the performers thought they could get away with it, and topical ad-libs were quietly inserted. Generally the Germans did not attend these entertainments, although the loneliness and isolation felt by many soldiers impelled them to attend performances even when they were unable to understand the content. Since listening to radio broadcasts was forbidden by the Germans, the latest popular tunes could only be incorporated into shows by clandestine listening and noting down of tunes and lyrics. In October 1943 a light opera The Paladins, with libretto by Horace Wyatt and music by PG Larbalestier, was mounted. The German censor passed the text despite the inclusion of a stirring and anthemic chorus \\"Faithful and Free\\" that became an expression of patriotic longing that produced an emotional response in the audience. When the Germans realised the reaction of audiences the Green Room Club was suppressed, although after some negotiation productions were allowed to resume but only if they were billed as being mounted by the \\"Dramatic Section\\" of the Club. In July 1943 the Opera House and other places of entertainment were ordered to be closed for a month, and again following D-Day on 6 June 1944 until 9 August 1944. In 1944, the popular German film actress Lil Dagover arrived to entertain German troops in Jersey and Guernsey with a theatre tour to boost morale.Lil Dagover: Schauspielerin When the electricity supply ended on 25 January 1945, performances at the Opera House ended. Immediately following Liberation on 9 May 1945, the Opera House reopened for a grand variety show on 10 May 1945 for released prisoners. =Post-Liberation theatre= Following the Liberation in 1945, Springfield Hall regularly hosted trade exhibitions, plays, pantomimes, shows, the Jersey Eisteddfod, and other attractions. Jersey Opera House Jersey Opera House Theatrical impresario Tommy Swanson purchased the Opera House at the end of the 1959 summer season. He undertook major renovations, adding 15 extra boxes, and returning it to live entertainment. In 1995 the States of Jersey became the new owner of the Jersey Opera House at a cost of ¬£1.3 million. In January 1997 the theatre closed for a major restoration project. A proposition was presented to the States of Jersey for a loan of ¬£5.5 million to add to the ¬£1.5 million that had been raised by the good will of the people and businesses of Jersey. This was successful and this major programme of work started in August 1998. After an extensive programme of rebuilding and renovation the new theatre opened its door on 9 July 2000 exactly 100 years to the day when the first Opera House had opened its doors to the public of Jersey. Jersey Arts Centre Work on the Jersey Arts Centre started in 1981 when the Education Committee made available the redundant domestic science building in Saint Helier. The complex was opened by the Bailiff in January 1983 and various components of the building were subsequently completed: the Berni Gallery opened later in 1983, and the first performance took place in the shell of the auditorium in January 1985 although the performance space was not completed until August 1986. In 1992 the public acquired the former garrison church of St James and work started in 1998 to convert it into an arts venue. From 2000 the Jersey Arts Centre has undertaken artistic programming for St James.Jersey Evening Post 15 January 2008 St James was closed in 2013 for a further refurbishment by the States of Jersey and the Jersey Arts Centre was given use of The Old Magistrates Court in St Helier Town Hall, until 2016. The Jersey Arts Centre continues to provide a theatrical space in Phillips St, in the 250 seater Benjamin Meaker Theatre, as well as performances in Care Homes, Historic Sites and Tours to the Other Islands and Europe. Controversy The Bailiff's powers of theatrical censorship were the subject of controversy during the term of office of Sir Peter Crill who refused permission for a visiting amateur theatre group to perform Howard Brenton's play Christie in LoveMarianne MacDonald, 'Jersey's censors ban Christie play', The Independent, 28 August 1993, p 3. and required changes to the staging of a production of Shakespeare's Coriolanus by the Tricycle Theatre Company to prevent an actor's naked buttocks being visible to the audience. On several occasions, however, 'he suggested that the role of chief censor should not lie with him, but should be at taken on by the elected members of the States'.Antonia Windsor, 'Sir Peter Crill', obituary in The Guardian, 27 January 2006 Theatre in J√®rriais Advertisement for a play in J√®rriais, 1935 The development of J√®rriais literature has included theatre in J√®rriais (the Norman dialect spoken in Jersey). The first book published in J√®rriais Rimes et Po√´sies Jersiaises (1865) included dramatic duologues, which may have been performed at traditional veil'yes (social neighbourhood gatherings) or read as closet dramas. Satirical playlets were also published in newspapers in the 19th century. √âlection de St. Martin, a playlet in J√®rriais and French published in the newspaper Le Constitutionnel on 24 November 1838, was probably never staged, but rather read in company. Henri Luce Manuel's Queur de Femme (in modern spelling: Tchoeu d'Femme ‚Äì \\"heart of a woman\\") of 1861 was published in pamphlet form. Esther Le Hardy's three-act play L'Enchorchelai, ou les tr√®s Paires (in modern spelling: L'Enchorch√©l√©, ou les Trais Paithes ‚Äì \\"The Bewitched, or the Three Pears\\") was published in 1880. Both plays are in rhyming couplets. In the early 20th century, E. J. Luce wrote plays and presented them around parish halls and other halls. En ch√®rche d'femme, L'√énvit√¢tion and L'Annonce X Y Z were all written before the First World War, subsequent to the setting up of the Jersey Eisteddfod. The most frequently performed of his plays L√© Proc√®s was published in pamphlet form and was revived as a touring fundraiser during the First World War, remaining a favourite long after. During the German military Occupation of Jersey 1940‚Äì1945, the inability of the Germans to understand J√®rriais enabled the performance of dramas that would otherwise not have passed the censor. A J√®rriais play performed at a parish hall was \\"as patriotic as could possibly be\\" but the Germans who attended the production did not understand it. Saint Martin's Public Hall George F. Le Feuvre took part in amateur dramatic performances, including in works by E. J. Luce, as a young man. Later in life he wrote plays for performance by L'Assembli√©e d'J√®rriais and at the Jersey Eisteddfod. 8 plays and 2 duologues written by him between 1946 and 1968 were published as a collection in Histouaithes et Gens d'J√®rri (1976). Amelia Perchard (1921‚Äì2012) was one of Jersey's foremost contemporary writers, writing many one-act plays for performance at the Jersey Eisteddfod. Actors and dramatists from Jersey Lillie Langtry, the Jersey Lily, is the island's most widely recognised cultural icon. Other stage actors from Jersey have included Seymour Hicks, Ivy St. Helier, Alma Stanley and Sylvestra Le Touzel. Playwright Frederick Lonsdale was born in Jersey.

Life He was the eldest son of Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie, by his wife Jean Lyon, and was still a minor at the time of his father's murder in 1607. When, in 1609, the trial of his father's murderer was not proceeded with on account of the absence of a prosecutor, a protest was made on his behalf and that of the other infant children, that their ultimate right of prosecution should not be invalidated. Spynie, however, after he came of age, agreed to waive his right of prosecution, when Lindsay of Edzell, the murderer, affirmed on oath that the slaughter was accidental, and undertook to pay a sum of eight thousand merks, and make over to him and his sister the lands of Garlobank, Perthshire. Edzell, on 7 March 1617, obtained a remission for the slaughter under the great seal. Spynie was one of the Scottish lords who attended the funeral of James VI and I in Westminster Abbey in 1625. On 2 June 1626 he was made commander-in-chief in Scotland for life. Having raised a regiment of three thousand foot for King Christian IV of Denmark-Norway, he served with distinction in both Denmark and Germany. Christian made him Governor General of the eastern Danish provinces of Sk√•ne, Halland and Blekinge.Steve Murdoch, 'Scotsmen on the Danish-Norwegian Frontiers c.1580-1680' in A. Mackillop and S. Murdoch (eds.), Military Governors and Imperial Frontiers c.1600-1800 (Leiden, 2003) pp.15-16. In 1628 his regiment fought at the siege of Stralsund alongside the regiment of Donald Mackay, Lord Reay. The Scots and their allies in the garrison were eventually relieved by Sir Alexander Leslie who was made governor of the city.Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618-1648 (London, 2014), pp.47-51. Lord Spynie and his regiment were thereafter recalled to Sk√•ne while Mackay's were recalled to Copenhagen leaving Leslie and his troops in command of the city. After his return to Scotland, his appointment as commander-in-chief was confirmed 28 June 1633. In the dispute with the Covenanters, Spynie supported the king Charles I of Great Britain. He joined Montrose at Perth after the battle of Tippermuir in September 1644, and with him on the 14th entered Aberdeen, but when Montrose two days afterwards vacated the city he was taken prisoner, and sent south to Edinburgh. Spynie died in March 1646. Family Spynie married first, Joanna Douglas, and secondly, Lady Margaret Hay, only daughter of George Hay, 1st Earl of Kinnoull. By his first wife he had no issue, but by his second he had two sons‚ÄîAlexander, master of Kinnoul, and George, who succeeded him as third lord‚Äîand two daughters: Margaret, married to William Fullarton of Fullarton, and Anne, who died unmarried.

He joined the British Army as a cornet in the 3rd Dragoons in 1778 and was successively promoted to lieutenant in the 22nd Dragoons (1779), captain (1781) and then major (1782).

Born in Poughkeepsie, Lavery trained as a lawyer, before devoting his career to the theatre and to film. He wrote the English libretto for Ernst Krenek's 1940 chamber opera Tarquin. 1943 saw him writing for three films: * He was one of the team of 22 writers collaborating on the 1943 film Forever and a Day. * He adapted Gregor Ziemer's 1943 book Education For Death for Edward Dmytryk's 1943 film Hitler's Children. * He wrote the 1943 American war film Behind the Rising Sun, based on the 1941 book by James R. Young. Lavery was president of the Screenwriters Guild of Los Angeles from 1945 to 1947. He served as vice president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1946. In 1946, Lavery was one of six Hollywood figures listed by William Wilkerson in a The Hollywood Reporter editorial under the headline \\"Hywd's Red Commissars!\\" Drawing on the biography Mr. Justice Holmes by Francis Biddle, he wrote the play The Magnificent Yankee, which opened in 1946, and he adapted it for the 1950 film version. In 1949, Lavery wrote his play The Song at the Scaffold, adapted from the novel Die Letzte am Schafott by Gertrud von Le Fort. In April‚ÄìMay 1949, Lavery had secured a contract from von Le Fort that granted him all rights to theatrical adaptations of her novel, and formally had declared his own play to be 'the only authorized dramatic version of the novel'. In 1952, Lavery learned of stage productions of Dialogues des Carm√©lites by Georges Benanos, which Bernanos had written as a film screenplay and completed in 1948, just before his death. In January 1949, von Le Fort had granted the Bernanos heirs permission to publish the screenplay, and had gifted her portion of the royalties due to her, as creator of the original story, over to Bernanos' widow and children. Lavery contacted the literary agent for the Bernanos heirs, Albert B√©guin, to inform the latter of the status of theatrical adaptation rights to the von Le Fort novel. Their subsequent two-year literary rights dispute reached arbitration by a jury from La Societ√© des Auteurs in Paris. On 20 July 1954, this jury ruled unanimously for Lavery, and ordered the Bernanos heirs to pay Lavery 100,000 FF for past contract infringements. In addition, the ruling required the Bernanos heirs to pay Lavery, with respect to all future productions of Dialogues des Carm√©lites, 15% of the royalties from English-language productions, and 10% from productions in all other languages. This allowed Lavery to earn royalties from both his own play and the Bernanos adaptation, with no contribution of his own to the latter, because of von Le Fort's waiver of her share of royalties and retroactive application of copyright. Separately, Francis Poulenc had begun to compose an opera based on Bernanos' work. He curtailed work on his opera in March 1954, in light of his understanding of the B√©guin- Lavery dispute. Following the July 1954 decision, separate negotiations occurred between B√©guin and Lavery, via Lavery's agent Marie Schebeko, on rights and royalties to allow Poulenc to write his opera. Lavery claimed to have met Poulenc in October 1954 and to have come to a cordial agreement on terms and royalties. However, the final formal agreement was not dated until 30 March 1955, and acknowledged Bernanos, Lavery, von Le Fort, Bruckberger, and Agostini. The terms stipulated that the Poulenc opera was adapted from Bernanos 'with the authorization of Monsieur Emmet Lavery', with Lavery listed in the credits after Bernanos and before von Le Fort, with no contributions of his own at all to Poulenc's libretto.Several reviews have incorrectly identified Lavery as the author of the English version of the libretto. Please see the Talk page for examples. In 1950, Lavery wrote Guilty of Treason; in 1953, Bright Road ; in 1955 The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell, which was nominated for \\"Best Story and Screenplay\\" at the 28th Academy Awards. He wrote Williamsburg: the Story of a Patriot, a 1957 orientation film for Colonial Williamsburg. Lavery and his wife Genevieve Lavery had two children. Their son Emmet G. Lavery, Jr. (1927-2014) was himself a lawyer and a producer in Hollywood. Their second child was a daughter, Elizabeth Taylor. His wife and children survived Lavery.

The Liberal candidate from the last General Election, Margaret Wintringham, was not available to stand as she had been selected as prospective Liberal candidate for Gainsborough. The local Liberal Association selected 64-year-old former Finchley MP, Atholl Robertson. He had represented Finchley from 1923‚Äì24 and had stood there last time but had since been replaced as candidate. On 24 April 1937 the local Labour Party had selected a new candidate in Reginald Groves, a Trotskyist. Main Issues and Campaign The Liberal campaign sought to appeal to those who supported a Popular Front. Robertson had secured the support of the Communist Party, which had signed up fully to the Popular Front message. Robertson called for arms for Spain, defence of democratic liberties and the economic and social advance of the people. The Labour candidate, Reginald Groves came under pressure to withdraw in favour of the Liberal candidate, when a group of local Labour Party supporters met and formed themselves into a 'Progressive Alliance' group. This group included 34-year-old Christopher Addison, son of the Labour Lord who had been a Liberal Cabinet Minister in Lloyd George's government. Other group members included author Ladbroke Black. The group Chairman was local JP, John Murphy. The meeting passed the following resolution; \\"We, the undersigned, deploring the international situation created by the National Government, have united without foregoing our individual political principles in forming a Progressive Alliance Group with the object of securing the registration of an effective anti-Government poll in the Mid-Bucks by-election, by supporting Mr. T Atholl Robertson.\\" This was followed up by a statement which added \\".. we appeal to our fellows to work and vote for the Liberal candidate... We also very seriously suggest to the Labour candidate, Mr Reginald Groves, that the greatest service he could render to the cause of democracy and peace would be to withdraw from the contest and lend his support to the candidate who had incomparably the better chance of defeating the representative of the National Government.....The only question before us is whether we approve or disapprove of the domestic and foreign policy now being pursued by Mr Chamberlain....We believe that if.. the Liberal and Labour candidates agreed to sink their differences....Mid-Bucks could be added to the list of constituencies which in the past weeks have shown the government how deeply the nation resents its betrayal of both democracy and British interests in its pursuance of a non- intervention policy which ...amounts to intervention on behalf of the Italian and German invaders against the people of Spain.\\" In addition, the neighbouring South-Bucks constituency had seen the local Liberal and Labour parties join together to form a South-Bucks Unity Committee. This group also called upon Groves to withdraw in favour of Robertson. Groves retained the support of the Daily Herald newspaper which was a traditional supporter of the Labour Party and a majority of his own local executive. He was also still able to attract leading Labour politicians to speak on his campaign platform, such as Clement Attlee, Ellen Wilkinson and Harold Laski. Groves also won support from the Independent Labour Party. On 12 May, David Lloyd George's Council of Action announced that it would play no part in the campaign because both Liberal and Labour candidates had given satisfactory answers to its questions. The replies Groves gave to them were clearly misleading and at odds with his own Trotskyist views. The Council was a strong supporter of action from the League of Nations yet in his manifesto Groves declared ‚Äúa successful League of Nations is not possible until the people are able to express and enforce effectively their will to peace‚Äù. Result Groves, the defeated Labour candidate claimed after the result that ‚Äúwe have delivered the death-blow to Liberalism in this division.‚Äù The Communist Party supporting Daily Worker criticised Groves ‚Äúdivisive Trotskyist splitting tactics‚Äù.

It was intended to fall into the newer Idflieg two seat CL-class, reserved for lighter two-seat fighters. The round cross section, plywood-covered fuselage was, apart from the second, tandem open cockpit similar in appearance to that of the D.Va, smoothly tapering to the nose with lines that merged into those of the spinner. As with the single-seater, the inline Mercedes D.III engine was largely enclosed but had its six upper cylinders exposed. The C.XIII was fitted with an early unit, less powerful than the D.Va's. The empennage was noticeably different, with a narrower, taller vertical tail. Its straight, constant-chord wings had single bays and were mounted without stagger. The undercarriage was of the fixed type, with mainwheels on V-struts and a faired- in tailskid. First flown in 1917, only one C.XIII was built and the type did not enter production; instead Albatros built the flat-sided, two-bay, more powerful C.XIV the following year for the light two-seat category, developing it into the production C.XV.

Mission  \\"To help bring about democracy and respect for human rights in North Korea.\\"  History  NKnet was founded in Seoul in 1998. Its founders are veterans of South Korea‚Äôs democracy movement and most at one time formerly supported North Korea‚Äôs Juche ideology. By the mid-1990s, however, those who would go on to found the group, including prominent activist Kim Young Hwaan, publicly renounced their support for the North Korean regime in response to increasing evidence of human rights violations in the country.  Activities  Past activities have included training programs, seminars, photo exhibitions, a speaker series, and an international conference on human rights in North Korea co-sponsored with the National Endowment for Democracy in 2010. In 2004, NKnet also launched and later spun off the Daily NK, an online newspaper that has a network of sources within North Korea. The organization also started Radio Free Chosun, which broadcasts to North Korea over shortwave radio. In 2011, NKnet hosted the world‚Äôs first annual North Korean Human Rights International Film Festival. In September 2012, it hosted its second annual film festival.

Among other findings, 79% of respondents said they never received international food aid, while 27% of international food aid recipients reported they had to return some or all of the aid to authorities after international monitors left. In 2012, Intermedia published A Quiet Opening: North Koreans in a Changing Media Environment, a report which featured data gathered by NKnet.  Awards  On December 11, 2009, NKnet received the Human Rights Award of Korea from the National Human Rights Commission of Korea for its role in raising awareness of human rights violations in North Korea. On December 10, 2012, the South Korean government awarded NKnet head researcher Kim Young Hwan the Order of Civil Merit \\"for his contribution to the promotion and protection of human rights in commemoration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\\" Earlier that year Kim and three other activists had been arrested in China and held for 114 days. Kim said he was arrested for assisting North Korean refugees in China and that the authorities tortured him during his detention. The Chinese government denied torturing him.

Its mission is to collect and preserve all aspects of aviation heritage with an emphasis on Australia and Queensland. The museum has the largest collection of historical aircraft in Queensland and it also has a large collection of aircraft engines, equipment, artefacts, photographs and books.  History  Queensland Air Museum, Caloundra Airport On 2 June 1974 the Queensland Air Museum was inaugurated with the official unveiling of a Canberra bomber that had been purchased from a Government disposal. The aircraft was displayed at the Pioneer Valley Park, which was a museum at Kuraby in Brisbane's southern suburbs. The park was eventually closed and the aircraft was moved to a leased site at Nudgee on the north side of Brisbane. The collection began to grow when a Meteor TT20 was donated to the museum by the British Government and a Vampire and two Sea Venoms were acquired. Due to the construction of the new Brisbane Airport nearby, the collection was forced to move to a temporary holding area on the airport site. Exorbitant rental costs at this location eventually lead to the museum being evicted and the resultant publicity resulted in an offer of a permanent home on the Sunshine Coast by the Landsborough Shire Council. On 14 June 1986 the collection was relocated to a site at Caloundra Airport which had a newly built hangar. The official opening of the museum took place on 4 April 1987 by Mrs Ly Bennett, wife of the museum's first patron, the late Air Vice-Marshal Don Bennett. Don Bennett was the Queensland born founder of the World War II Bomber Command Pathfinder Force and to honour this the road in front of the museum was named Pathfinder Drive. Now with a permanent home the collection continued to grow and in 1989 it was bolstered by an ambitious recovery expedition to Singapore where a Sea Vixen, Meteor and Hunter were purchased from a scrap metal dealer just days before their destruction. The aircraft were disassembled and successfully shipped to Australia where they were restored and placed on display. Queensland Air Museum Hangar 2 display The two hectare museum site has been steadily developed with the construction of a second hangar being completed in July 2004 which was later extended in 2006. A library, restoration and storage facilities have also been constructed. In September 2006, Mr Allan Vial, DFC OAM OPR (Pol), become the Patron of the Queensland Air Museum, he is also Life President of the Pathfinder Force Association in Australia. A plan to relocate Caloundra Airport placed an uncertain future on the museum for many years. But on 2 September 2010 the Queensland Premier Anna Bligh announced in Parliament that the airport would continue to operate on its present site and she said this would provide \\"certainty for the iconic air museum\\".Queensland Parliament Record of Proceedings 2 September 2010, page 3055 http://www.parliament.qld.gov.au/work-of-assembly/sitting- dates/dates/2010/2010-09-02 The museum's situation further improved when the Sunshine Coast Regional Council granted the museum a 30-year lease extension and on 28 March 2013 a Caloundra Aerodrome Master Plan was adopted. The Plan recognised the museum's tourism potential and provided for a substantial increase in the size of the museum's site to allow for expansion.Sunshine Coast Regional Council Agenda and Minutes of Ordinary Meeting 28 March 2013, Section 7.5.1 Caloundra Aerodrome Master Plan http://210.247.232.237/sitePage.cfm?code=cr-meetings In August 2013, former Australian Defence Force Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Geoff Shepard AO (ret) became the patron of the museum.

The Wirraway was a licensed built North American NA-16 which was manufactured between 1939 and 1946. With 755 manufactured it is the second most produced aircraft type in Australia. Deliveries to the RAAF began just months before the outbreak of World War II and they served in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Borneo areas against the Japanese in tactical reconnaissance, target marking, dive bombing and army co-operation roles. They were also used by the RAAF as an advanced trainer throughout the war and for many years after with their retirement from service in 1958. The example in the Queensland Air Museum collection is A20-652 construction number 1104. It was built in July 1944 in the final production batch which had the designation of CA-16. The museum purchased the aircraft with a grant from the John Villiers Trust in October 2010. It was flown from Adelaide, South Australia to Caloundra and placed on display in a flyable condition. The aircraft is maintained to preserve it in an operational condition and it is run in the regular Operation Engine Collection public displays.Queensland Air Museum web site. http://www.qam.com.au/aircraft/wirraway/A20-652.htm Retrieved: 27-7-2013 RAAF F-111C A8-129 at the Queensland Air Museum = General Dynamics F-111C A8-129 = The F-111 aircraft was the RAAF's premier strike asset for 37 years until the type's retirement in December 2010.

The aircraft had the ability to perform a \\"dump and burn\\" which involved dumping fuel from an outlet between the engine jet pipes and igniting it with the engine's afterburners. The spectacular flame produced was popular at air shows, sporting events and firework displays, such as the annual Brisbane River Fire firework show and the 2000 Sydney Olympics closing ceremony. The Queensland Air Museum has F -111C aircraft A8-129 on display, which is on long term loan from the RAAF.

The Australian Inland Mission Aerial Medical Service, which would later become the RFDS, was established by Reverend John Flynn on 15 May 1928 in Cloncurry, Queensland. Flynn had a vision to use radios and aircraft to connect doctors and patients in remote locations.

This aircraft is restored using parts from several Skyfox aircraft with the wing being from the original aircraft.Queensland Air Museum web site. http://www.qam.com.au/aircraft/skyfox/VH-CAL.htm Retrieved: 27-7-2013 Calair Corporation was created in October 1989 to produce a derivative of the Denny Kitfox at Caloundra Airport. The aircraft to be known as the Calair CA21 Skyfox was a two-seat high-wing monoplane with a tail wheel undercarriage for use in the training and recreational flying market. A number of changes were made to the Kitfox design to increase the loaded weight, which brought it up to the Australian CAO 101-55 standard. This allowed it to be commercial produced and be used for general aviation pilot training and it was the first aircraft in Australia to be so certified. It was powered by a 2.1L, 58.2 kW (78 hp) Aeropower engine built in Perth, Western Australia, which was essentially a Volkswagen adaptation. 33 CA21s were produced between July 1990 and August 1991. In 1991 the company was sold and the name was changed to Skyfox Aviation Ltd. Production then switched to the CA22 which incorporated numerous changes including a change to a Rotax 912 engine. A total of 61 were produced at which time it gained certification under the European Joint Airworthiness Requirements for Very Light Aircraft (JAR/VLA), the first Australian aircraft to do so. The next 10 aircraft produced after the certification in June 1993 were designated CA25. The final stage in the development of the Skyfox was the production of a model with tricycle landing gear to better cater for the pilot training market. This was called the CA25N Gazelle and would take over the production run. A total of 66 would be completed before production ceased in May 1998 when the company under financial difficulties was placed under voluntary administration. = Pathfinder Force = During World War II the British Bomber Command was engaged in night time area bombing of Germany. In 1942 these operations were resulting in an aircraft loss rate of between 4 and 5 percent and only a third of the aircraft were able to drop their bombs within 5 miles (8 km) of the target. In an effort to improve the accuracy the Pathfinder Force was created on 15 August 1942, under the leadership of Acting Group Captain Don Bennett, who was born in Toowoomba. The specialised squadrons in the Pathfinder Force had aircraft that were crewed by experienced crews who would lead the main bomber force to locate the target and mark it with flares. This would give the bomber force coming in behind an improved chance of dropping their bombs in the right place.Australian Dictionary of Biography ‚Äì Bennett, Donald Clifford by John McCarthy. http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/bennett-donald-clifford- don-12194 Retrieved 27-7-2013Royal Air Force web site. http://www.raf.mod.uk/history/bombercommandno8group.cfm Retrieved 28-7-2013 To commemorate the Pathfinder Force the museum has a large display, which was established and maintained in conjunction with the Pathfinder Force Association of Australia. It includes uniforms, memorabilia, models and a reproduction of Don Bennett's office which contains many of his original possessions. The display is located adjacent to the F-111 strike aircraft which provides a link to the modern air force.

The Four Mothers movement was able to influence Israeli public opinion, and ultimately the Israeli government decided on IDF withdrawal from Southern Lebanon unilaterally, executed in May 2000. Background In 1982, Israel decided to invade into Lebanon. in what was then called by the Israelis Operation Peace for Galilee, in order to root out Palestinian insurgents and support the Christian militias and the Free Lebanon State on the course of the Lebanese Civil War. Following the 1982-85 fighting, the IDF remained deployed in the area of southern Lebanon controlled by Lebanese Christian militias, which was declared by the Israelis as a security zone. Though most casualties on the course of consequent 1985-2000 conflict with Hezbollah were from the South Lebanon Army ranks, this deployment had claimed many casualties also from the IDF over the years. The most serious incident of IDF at the time being the helicopter disaster, which occurred on February 4, 1997 killing 73 soldiers from the Nahal Brigade, armored and Engineering fighters (188 Brigade and Battalion 601) and the helicopter crew. Following the 1997 helicopter disaster, four women from Northern Israel, whom were mothers of soldiers who served in Lebanon, Rachel Ben Dor, Miri Sela, Ronit Nahmias and Zahara Antebi, decided to organize protest activities which will call for the unilateral and immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon. The purpose of the movement was to put public pressure on the Israeli government to withdraw from Lebanon, with or without a peace agreement, and thus to implement the United Nations Security Council Resolution 425, calling for the recognition of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Lebanon, for the IDF to leave the area and the deployment of an international force in the region. The movement ignored the South Lebanon Army-IDF alliance understandings in regard to Israeli support for the South Lebanon security zone administration, emphasizing the human life cost of the IDF deployment. Later, Ben-Dor became chairman of the movement and was joined by Orna Shimoni and others. Although called Four Mothers movement and was of a feminist base it was able to recruit men, including former soldiers who served in Lebanon. During its period of activities, when it was in the center of public discourse the movement numbered around five hundred members. Activity and public discourse =First steps= The first step of the movement was to hold a small demonstration at Mahanayim Junction. They protested against the fact that the Israeli government that had expressed its willingness to withdraw from Lebanon in 1985 did nothing in the 12 years to come to promote it. The demonstrators, whom were the base for the movement of four mothers, have rapidly gained media attention and many joined them. Within a few months thousands of people have signed a petition of solidarity with the movement, and on 5 July 1997 the founding conference was held in which several dozen of women and men participated. Following this, additional activity centers were frequently added across the country. =Message= Four Mothers had conveyed a message of concern for the \\"fighting children\\". This message was a line of thought that was not to be spoken out loud in Israel until then. Most of the protest movements in Israel until then dealt with the \\"territories\\" (Gaza, West Bank ) and arguments in Israel revolved around whether to settle these areas and is it worth fighting for. Four mothers did not claim this point of view and had set the goal of a unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon stemmed from their point of view of solely being concerned for the lives of the soldiers. The initial target audience was mothers of soldiers, since, in their view, they had a direct connection to the problem. The personal concern for the soldiers was the drive behind many activists. Subsequently and gradually, the IDF claim that its presence in Lebanon secures the \\"Peace for Galilee\\" had strengthened the impression among public opinion in Israel that being in Lebanon is what leads to the attacks against IDF soldiers in Lebanon. Other violent developments, like shooting on IDF forces beyond the security zone, counter shellings on Israeli population in the north also left the impression that it is only in result of the presence of Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon. From here it was a short step to conclude that the resistance by Hezbollah actually expresses the will of the Lebanese people (mostly the Shias) against the occupation of south Lebanon, which has divided the Shiite people for years. those in the South and those north of the security zone. Such a view was laid out by Dan Steinberg in an essay that was delivered to the Israeli press called \\"The truth about the lie of Lebanon\\" =Course of action= Four Mothers movement had developed a strategy to achieve their ultimate goal and its actions included government level and political activities, on the one hand, and the public sphere on the other. The movement felt it had to find the best and most effective way for achieving its goal and therefore its public activities turned to the more broad public opinion and was mainly characterized by a broad and strong connection with the media on all fronts. The movement's PR became widespread system. The movement's activities included marches and demonstrations across the country, signing petitions, attending conferences and political TV shows, and even political protests in front of the offices of heads of state and various decision makers. The movement also received media coverage overseas and articles about it was published in many media outlets around the world. Moreover, the movement had received may letters of support from women and peace organizations. On the government level, however, it was a much more of a relaxed front, and was characterized by an attempt to garner support for their goals by continuing to pressure the ministers and MKs through conversations and dialogue . Similarly, the movement chose to cooperate with other movements, such as \\"Withdrawal from Lebanon\\" by MK Yossi Beilin and the \\"Religious women for the sanctity of life\\", whom basically advocated the same objectives, in order to increase four mothers support base. However, the Four Mothers movement was characterized by the fact that it was not related to any of the political parties in Israel and neither desired to be defined as belonging to one political camp or another. Four Mothers tried to arouse public interest without disturbing public order, and subsequently differences arose among movement members, and some of the activists tried to establish a breakaway movement of their own whose activity failed. Despite the delays, and thanks to extensive activity, the movement had become an influential player in Israeli public life and a meaningful social phenomenon. =Public discourse= Four Mothers tried to engage in the public sphere in places where it was perceived to be \\"a man's world\\" in Israeli society - the Israeli army, and against all odds was able to raise the issue of unilateral withdrawal to the level of a national agenda, to arouse public opinion and exert massive pressure on decision makers. As the public debate around the movement intensified, the leaders of Four Mothers became regular participants in the Israeli political discourse, and have turned into the leaders of the whole struggle for the withdrawal from Lebanon. As long as the goals were not achieved, the movement continued its activities on the two levels, and continued to raise awareness and civil protest. It started out without any political power, budget, and were not taken seriously by the decision makers. But over time, its power intensified due to the wide media coverage it had received. Four Mothers movement was a peripheral movement that has come to symbolize the struggle and later became one of the symbols of Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. The movement sparked social controversy and large parts of the Israeli public did not agree with the agenda presented by Four Mothers. At first the movement took a lot of heat and were belittled because its leaders were women. Women of the movement were perceived as having disorientation on security affairs and its activities perceived as a selfish act of defeatism that do not match the values of Israeli society which perceived the IDF and its fighters as a supreme value. The appeal to the Feminine and maternal feelings did not always succeed and female politicians and bereaved mothers sometimes saw in Four Mothers a danger to Israeli society. Additionally, it was feared of a demoralization of Israeli soldiers, particularly in Lebanon, but also in other areas of conflicts. Various statements against the movement were made by opponents, among them, reserve Brigadier General Rafi Noy, who claimed the movement activities endangered the security of IDF soldiers, and by commander of Golani Brigade, Colonel Shmuel Zakai, who called the movement \\"four rags\\". =The withdrawal from Lebanon and ending the activity= On May 24, 2000, three years after the establishment of the movement, The IDF withdrew from Lebanon by the orders of Prime Minister Ehud Barak. As soon as the Four Mothers organization realized that there is a mutual purpose between them and the Prime Minister, the public activity decreased and along with withdrawal itself, the Four Mothers movement was disbanded because it felt it had achieved its goals and as a social organization has accomplished its mission. Nevertheless, current protest movements in Israel are inspired by the activity of the four Mothers movement, and veteran activists from the movement had established new movements such as: \\"Mabat La'Ofek\\" for dialogue with the settlers, \\"The seventh day\\" and \\"The Fifth Mother\\".

The car was an evolution of the Chevron B26, and was initially fitted with a 2-litre Hart 420R straight-four engine producing . However, various other engines were used; the car also ran with engines such as the 3-litre Cosworth DFV V8, the 2-litre Cosworth FVD/Cosworth BDG straight-four engines, and the 2-litre BMW M12 straight-four, amongst others. Design The Chevron B31 was an evolution of the B26, and was designed for the European 2-Litre Championship by Chevron Cars Ltd's founder Derek Bennett in 1975; six cars were built. The B31 featured subtle changes, such as a slightly redesigned bodywork, but it featured the same basic aluminium monocoque chassis as its predecessor. The bodywork was made from fiberglass, and the B31 was designed to use the same Hart 420R engine as its predecessor had. The 420R was a naturally-aspirated 2-litre, 16 valve DOHC fuel-injected straight-four engine, with a maximum power output of at 9500 rpm, and the power was transmitted to the rear wheels by a Hewland 5-speed manual transmission. For the suspension, the B31 featured double wishbones, coil springs over dampers with an anti-roll bar at the front, and single top links, twin lower links, twin trailing arms, coil springs over dampers with an anti-roll bar at the rear. The brakes were ventilated discs all round, and the car had rack-and-pinion steering. As the car weighed , it had a power-to-weight ratio of exactly 0.5 hp/kg. Racing history =1975-1982: International competition= 1975 The B31 made its racing debut in 1975 at the 1000 km of Mugello, which was part of the World Championship for Makes; KVG Racing entered John Hine and Ian Grob in a B31, and Team Italiano Chevron also ran the new car, choosing Eris Tondelli and Mauro Nesti to drive it. Team Italiano Chevron, however, had the B31 fitted with a 1.3-litre Cosworth straight-four engine in place of the Hart 420R; thus, whilst the KVG Racing car was classified in the Sports 2000 category, the Team Italiano Chevron car was classified in the Sports 1300 category. Although the 1300cc car retired, KVG Racing won the Sports 2000 class, and finished fifth overall. The 1300cc car was then entered in the second round of the Campionato Italiano Group 5 Sport, held at Varano; \\"Bramen\\", its driver, was classified eighth in the Sports 1300 category. The car's next international event was the 800 km of Dijon, where KVG Racing were the only team to enter a B31; they took third overall, and the Sports 2000 class victory. At the 1000 km of Monza, Grob crashed his B31 in practice, leaving the car too damaged to compete in the race; instead, \\"Bramen\\" and Pasquale Anastasio were the only B31 drivers to compete in the race; they won the Sports 1300 class, and finished 13th overall. At the 1000 km of Spa, KVG Racing were once again the only entrants; this time, they finished third in the Sports 2000 class, and 14th overall. At the 1000 km of Pergusa, KVG Racing entered their car, whilst \\"Bramen\\" partnered Giancarlo Gagliardi in a 1.6-litre Cosworth FVA straight-four engined car that had been entered by Scuderia Citta dei Mille; although KVG Racing finished ninth overall and last (second in the Sports 2000 class), Scuderia Citta dei Mille won the Sports 1600 class (as they were the only entrant in that class to finish), and finished sixth overall. At the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, both of the entered B31s featured Hart 420R engines; KVG Racing had entered one, as usual, but this time they were joined by Fisons Racing, who entered Martin Raymond and Tony Goodwin in their car. However, neither car had a successful race; the Fisons Racing car suffered an oil leak after 23 laps, and was forced to retire, whilst the KVG Racing car was classified eighth in the Sports 2000 class (26th overall), but suffered a throttle linkage failure after 30 laps, whilst leading its class. Four Hart 420R-engined B31s were entered in the European 2-Litre Championship (E2LC) opener, held at Brands Hatch; KVG Racing entered Hine and Grob in two separate cars, whilst Fisons Racing entered Raymond, and the fourth entrant did not show up. Although Raymond did not compete in the race, having blown his engine up, Hine won the first heat, and Grob finished fourth in that heat; in the second heat, Grob finished third, whilst Hine span, stalled, and was forced to retire. At the rain-shortened 1000 km of Zeltweg, Fisons Racing (now called Team Fisons) and KVG Racing both entered B31 Harts; the KVG Racing car blew its engine after nine laps, but the Team Fisons car finished 13th overall, and sixth in class. At the Hockenheim round of the E2LC, four B31 Harts were entered; KVG Racing entered Grob and Richard Lloyd, although the latter did not attend, whilst Team Fisons Racing entered Raymond, and J√∂rg Zaborowski entered as a privateer, but did not attend the race. Grob finished fourth in the first heat, whilst Raymond finished second; Grob's 21st in the second heat dropped him to 17th overall, but Raymond won the second heat, and won the event outright. This would prove to be the car's last major international event of the season, although Raymond did enter his B31 in the Interserie championship, as he had been doing throughout the season. 1976 The B31's first appearance of 1976 came in the 300 km of N√ºrburgring, which was the opening round of the World Sportscar Championship (WSC); although three cars were entered, neither finished the race, as Manrico Zanuso's B31 blew its 3-litre Cosworth DFV V8 engine before the start of the race, Tony Charnell crashed his 2-litre Cosworth FVC straight-four engined B31 out of the race, whilst Peter Smith and John Turner did not actually attend the race. For the 4 Hours of Monza, five B31s were entered; John Blanckley entered Zanuso and Raymond in a DFV-engined B31, Hay Seech entered Bob Marsland and Alois M√ºller in a Hart-engined B31, Anastasio partnered \\"Tambauto\\" in a 1.3-litre Cosworth-engined B31, Smith and Turner drove a 2-litre Cosworth-engined B31, and Claudio Francisci and Biaggio Cammarone drove another 1.3-litre Cosworth B31. However, the cars of Smith/Turner and Francisci/Cammarone did not attend the race, and neither of the other three B31s finished; the Hay Seech car blew its engine after 72 laps, the Anastasio/\\"Tambauto\\" car blew its engine after 64 laps, and the John Blanckley car suffered a cooling system failure after 28 laps. The third round of the WSC, which was the 500 km of Imola, saw only one B31 entered; Blanckley entered himself and Zanuso in a DFV-engined B31, but retired again, this time due to gearbox failure after 52 laps. For the Coppa Florio Pergusa, Francisci and Bruno Del Fante entered the only B31 of the event, a 1.3-litre Cosworth- engined car; the team failed to make the start of the race. At the 500 km of Dijon, Blanckley and Raymond drove their DFV-engined B31, but retired once again, after 105 laps. At the 200 miles of Salzburgring, it was a similar story; Zanuso and Blanckley retired the DFV-engined car due to a halfshaft failure. As this was the final round of the WSC season, it meant that no B31 had finished a race in the series; although B31s were used to win a non- championship race at Zolder, a, Interserie race at Zolder, and the Thruxton round of the British Sports Car Championship during the 1976 season. 1977 The 1977 World Sportscar Championship season started the same way that 1976 had gone. For the 500 km of Dijon, Tom Charnell and Ian Bracey drove a Hart 420R-engined B31, but retired due to a flywheel failure after 14 laps. For the 500 km of Monza, three B31s were entered: Martin Raymond and John Blanckley entered a DFV-engined car, Chandler Ibec International-Team Lloyds entered Bracey and Tony Charnell in the Hart-engined car, and Claudio Francisci partnered Giuseppe Fiaccadori in the remaining B31, which was fitted with a 1600cc Cosworth engine. For the first time since 1975, the B31 finished a WSC race; although Raymond and Blanckley did not attend, Francisci and Fiaccadori finished eighth overall, and fifth in the Sports 2000 class, whilst Bracey and Charnell finished immediately behind them, and won the Sports 1800 class. For the 400 km of Vallelunga, Francisci entered himself once more in the 1600cc Cosworth-engined B31, whilst Blanckley and Rolf G√∂tz entered the DFV-engined car. Although Blanckley and G√∂tz did not attend, Francisci finished fourth overall, and won the Sports 1600 class. A 2-litre Cosworth FVD-engined B31 was then entered by Chandler Ibec International-Team Lloyds at the 1977 24 Hours of Le Mans, the first time a B31 had been used in the endurance event. Charnell, Bracey and Robin Smith were selected to drive the car, but the team retired after 21 laps due to a fuel pump failure. Five B31s were entered in the 500 km of Le Castellet; Mogil Motors entered Charnell and Robin Smith in a 2-litre Cosworth FVC-engined car, whilst three 2-litre Chrysler-Simca straight-4 engined cars were entered (Michel Pignard, Michel Dubois and Jean-Louis Bos in one, Albert Dufr√©ne and Fran√ßois Servanin in a second, and Jean-Pierre Jaussaud partnered Jacques Henry (F) in the other car) and Raymond entered himself and G√∂tz in the DFV-engined car. Jassaud and Henry finished third overall, and won the Sports 2000 class, whilst Charnell and Smith finished right behind them, the two other Chrysler-Simca-engined cars retired, and the pairing of Raymond and G√∂tz once again did not compete in the race. For the 250 km of Imola, Francisci partnered \\"Robin Hood\\" in a 1.6-litre Cosworth FVA-engined car, and Blanckley entered himself and G√∂tz in the DFV car; although the latter pairing once again did not attend the race, \\"Robin Hood\\" and Francisci finished eleventh overall, and third in the Sports 1600 class. 1978 For 1978, the World Sportscar Championship had folded; as a result, the European Sportscar Championship (ESC) was introduced in its place. In the opening round of the ESC season, which was the 300 km of N√ºrburgring, Raymond drove his DFV-powered car to ninth place, and second in the Sports 2.0+ category. Four cars were entered at the next ESC race, which was the 320 km of Monza; however, three failed to qualify, and the one car that did, a Cosworth BDG-engined B31 driven by Robin Smith and Charnell, retired due to engine problems. Charnell and Smith were partnered by Fr√©deric Alliot and Richard Jones for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, but their race was strewn with problems, and the 181 laps they completed were insufficient for them to be classified. Secondo Ridolfi and Grassi were the only two to use a B31 at the Coppa Florio Pergusa, the fourth round of the ESC season, and they finished sixth. This was the car's best result all season in any championship. 1979 In 1979, the European Sportscar Championship folded, and the World Championship for Makes (WCM) replaced it. Nesti was the solitary B31 entry in the 6 Hours of Mugello, which was the second round of the WCM; however, he did not compete in the B31, instead driving a BMW 320i with Luigi Moreschi. Ridolfi partnered Roberto Marazzi in the 1000 km of Monza, which formed part of the Italian Group 6 Championship; they took their 1.6-litre Ford-engined car to fourth overall, and won the Sports 1600 category. Blanckley then attempted to enter the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, but did not attend the race. G√∂tz and Blanckley's next WCM entry was at the 6 Hours of Brands Hatch; once again, they did not actually compete in the event. The best B31 finish of the season came in July, when G√∂tz took his BMW M12-engined car to second in the third round of the Interserie championship, held at N√ºrburgring. 1980 The B31 was still being entered into WCM events in 1980; G√∂tz attempted to run himself and Roland Binder in the 1000 km of Monza, but did not compete. G√∂tz and Blanckley then entered the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, and brought their BMW-powered B31 home in 15th overall, and won the Sports 2000 category. The first seven laps also scored points for the Interserie championship; G√∂tz was classified seventh at this point (and third in the Sports 2000 class), for what would prove to be the B31's best overall finish of the year. The last B31 entries of 1980 in the WCM came at the 6 Hours of Vallelunga, where two 1.6 litre Cosworth cars were entered; \\"Menes\\" and Franco Forini in one car, whilst Maurizio Gellini and Luigino Grassi drove the other. Neither would finish the race; as Gellini/Grassi retired after 108 laps, and \\"Menes\\"/Forini retired four laps later. 1981 By 1981, the B31 was being used less and less. Gellini partnered Ridolfi in a 1.6-litre Cosworth BDG-engined car at the 1000 km of Monza, but they lasted just nine laps before retiring. Jones and Barrie Williams then ran a 2-litre BDG-powered B31 at the 6 Hours of Silverstone, but the race was far from trouble-free, and the 141 laps that they completed were not enough to be classified. G√∂tz, Binder and Blanckley initially entered a DFV-powered B31 in the 1000 km of N√ºrburgring, but instead G√∂tz and Binder drove a Lola T296, whilst Blanckley drove a McLaren M8 Special. The B31's best finish of 1981 came at the sixth round of the Interserie championship, held at N√ºrburgring; G√∂tz brought his DFV-engined car home in seventh overall, and fourth in the Sports 2000+ class. =1982-1984: Interserie success= 1982 In 1982, the B31 was not used in any World Endurance Championship (WEC) races; instead, it was used solely in the Interserie championship, and all bar one entry was from G√∂tz. Despite the fact that the B31 was now seven years old, it was still fairly successful in the Interserie; G√∂tz finished sixth overall, and second in Division II, at the opening round of the season, held at N√ºrburgring. A fifth overall, and fourth in Division II at the √ñsterreichring followed, before G√∂tz finished eighth and fifth overall (fourth and second in his division) in the next two N√ºrburgring races. Autodrom Most saw Rainer Rahardt attempt to enter, but not compete; however G√∂tz finished fourth overall, and second in his division. G√∂tz finished the season by taking fifth overall, and second in Division II, at Siegerland. G√∂tz finished the Interserie season in fourth overall, with 67 points. 1983 In 1983, G√∂tz was the only person to run a B31. He started his season by taking seventh overall in the fourth round of the Deutsche Rennsport Meisterschaft (DRM) series, held at Mainz-Finthen; he was the fastest of the three Group 6 entrants. G√∂tz then took fourth overall, and third in Division II, at the opening round of the Interserie, held at the √ñsterreichring. He would take seventh overall at Most, and fourth in his division, before following this with ninth and seventh overall in the two Siegerland races (second and third in his division.) Seventh at Hockenheim, and second in Division II, meant that G√∂tz finished the 1983 Interserie season classified in third place, with 64 points; he was level with Binder on points, but had no class wins to Binder's three, and was classified behind him as a result. 1984 Now entering its ninth season, the venerable B31 was still G√∂tz's car of choice for the Interserie. In the season opener, held at AVUS, G√∂tz took third overall, and won Division II, for the car's best overall finish since 1979. He was slightly less competitive at the √ñsterreichring, where he finished seventh overall, and fourth in his division; and he was unable to do better than 14th overall, and sixth in his division, at the N√ºrburgring. G√∂tz then took another seventh overall, and fourth in his division, at Erding; however, this was followed by a successful race at Most, where he couldn't make the start of the race. The final round of the Interserie season, held again at the N√ºrburgring, was also unsuccessful; G√∂tz could do no better than 16th, and seventh in Division II. He slipped to joint- sixth in the Driver's standings; level with Henri Pescarolo in a Porsche 956. Gotz switched to a March 832 for 1985, and the B31 would remain unused in that year, and 1986. =1987-1990: Later career= 1987-1988 After three years of inactivity, two B31s were entered in a non-championship race at Kyalami; Duckhams/All-Car entered Allan Quinn and Chad Wentzel in their car, whilst Giorgio Cavalieri and Ben Morgenrood drove a Mazda-powered B31. Although Quinn and Wentzel retired after 49 laps, Cavalieri and Morgenrood were able to bring their B31 home in 14th, and third in the Thundersport class. In 1988, G√©rard MacQuillan entered himself and Williams in a 2-litre BMW M12-engined B31/36 in the fourth round of the BRDC C2 Championship, held at Oulton Park; they finished ninth, and last. Despite this, MacQuillan used the car again at Brands Hatch; he and Tony Lanfranchi finished fifth. MacQuillan and Williams would then enter the Silverstone round of the series, finishing eighth overall, and second in Class C. 1989-1990 MacQuillan and Williams entered two Thundersports races in their B31/36 at the start of the 1989 season; both ended in retirement. Despite this, they ran the car again in the Oulton Park round of the BRDC C2 Championship; they finished ninth. Two further races followed that year; seventh at Thruxton, before bearing problems prevented the pair from starting the race at Silverstone. One further entry in 1990 would follow, at the Donington Park round of the BRDC C2 Championship; this also resulted in a failure to start. After 15 years of competition, the B31 was finally retired, as it never competed again.

Vacancy The by-election was caused by the death of the sitting Conservative MP, Ernest Roy Bird on 27 September 1933. He had been MP here since holding the seat in 1924. Election history Skipton had been won by the Conservatives at every election since 1918 and was a safe seat. The result at the last General election was as follows; Candidates The local Conservatives selected 56-year-old George William Rickards a silk manufacturer. He had been a member of the West Riding County Council since 1928 but had not before stood for parliament. The Labour party re-selected John Davies who had stood here in 1929 and 1931, finishing second both times. He was a cotton manufacturer from Lancashire. The Liberals had not fielded a candidate since 1929 when they came third. They selected a new candidate, Robert Coventry Denby, a 48 year old Bradford solicitor. The Communists, who had not stood here before, selected first time candidate James Rushton. Main issues and campaign Foreign Affairs dominated the campaign, particularly the Conservative dominated National Government's isolationist approach. The Labour candidate, Davies, claimed to be a pacifist and argued for unilateral disarmament. The Liberals criticised the Conservatives for not looking to work with the League of Nations to achieve disarmament and criticised Labour for calling for unilateral disarmament. R.C. Denby, the Liberal candidate, gave a speech reported in the Guardian on 3 November, in which he outlined his and his party's position on disarmament and the League of Nations; \\"We have not convinced the world that we are really sincere in our desire for disarmament. For one thing, they can point to our reservation of bombing from the air. While, in the present circumstances, any further large-scale disarmament can only come by international agreement, I believe that if we had a strong Liberal Government we should give such a lead as would influence other Powers and get them to agree on a wider measure of disarmament.\\" Covenants Without the Sword: Public Opinion and British Defence Policy, 1931-1935 Result Despite a large swing against the National Government, the Conservative managed to hold on to the seat. Aftermath Rickards continued to sit as MP until he died in 1943. Davies continued to stand as Labour candidate here without success until 1946 when Prime Minister Clement Attlee gave him a seat in the House of Lords. Neither Denby or Rushton stood for parliament again. A Peace Ballot was launched in 1934 to ascertain public support for the League of Nations and collective security. As a result, just before the 1935 general election, the National Government agreed to the Liberal policy of working through the League of Nations.

It passed by marriage to the Parry family of Denbighshire and passed down in that family until sold in 1831 to General Sir John Malcolm on his return from India. He described it as \\"a large three-storey mansion, built in the 1730s, with ten bedrooms, stabling, a paddock, an orangery, a well-wooded park with a two-acre lake, a fine garden with a terrace, kitchen garden and outhouses\\". Malcolm died shortly afterwards and the property was bought by William Charles King. The house was substantially altered or rebuilt in the 1840s and, following a serious fire, was rebuilt in the 1870s by William King. In 1890 King's daughter, Georgina, married Field Marshal Sir Charles Brownlow who moved into the house. The house was extended in the late 19th century and altered again in the early 20th century. In 1939 the house was acquired by Sir Thomas Sopwith who used it as his home until the house was sold at auction in 1952. In the mid 1970s the house was used as the American Military HQ in the film The Eagle Has Landed. It is now the property of Sheik Ali Juffali, a director of E. A. Juffali and Brothers.

It was founded in 1853 at Amanzimtoti a settlement just over south of Durban by an American missionary. The settlement there is known as Adams Mission. The college's alumni include Presidents of Botswana and Uganda, several ministers and leaders of the African National Congress. It is recognised as a historic school. It has been called Adams School, Amanzimtoti Institute and the Amanzimtoti Zulu Training School. History The school was founded in 1853 by the Reverend David Rood, missionary of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The school was located on the glebe of the Amanzimtoti mission and was initially named the Amanzimtoti Institute. Rood had arrived in Natal 20 January 1848 and subsequently established the Ifafa mission station. Rood then transferred to Amanzimtoti following the 16 September 1851 death of mission founder the Reverend Newton Adams, M.D. Adams was much revered and in the 1930s the school was renamed Adams College in his honour. Adams had arrived in 1835 with two other missionaries, but after being rebuffed by the local chief they had each set out to establish three complementary missions. Adams had chosen a site south of Durban where he founded a \\"family school\\" within months of his arrival. The school attracted both adults and children. He was helped by an early convert called Mbalasi who was the widow of Duze Ka Mnengwa KaKhondlo. He had been a Chief of the Makanya killed during the wars with Shaka leaving Mbalasi to care for herself. She and her son Nembula became part of the Adams home.Adams College , Historic Schools Restoration Project, accessed 3 August 2013 A historic meeting took place here in 1881 when the Reverend William Cullen Wilcox was asked to talk to a fatherless student called John Dube about his poor behavior at the school. John was the son of the Reverend James Dube who was the Congregational minister in Inanda. In 1887 John Dube was \\"adopted\\" by the Wilcoxes and taken to America to study at Oberlin College.John Dube timeline, SAHistory.org.za, accessed 3 August 2013 Wilcox was to be eventually awarded with a medal by the South African government and Dube was to open his own school, his own newspaper and to be the first leader of what was to become the African National Congress. In 1888 Dr. John Mavuma Nembula, a student from Adams, returned to the College from America. He had been sent to America to help with translating a Zulu Bible but he had stayed there and he had become a physician. He was the first Black South African to do this and for a while taught physiology at the college.John Mavuma Nembula, SAHistory.org.za, accessed 8 August 2013 In 1924 Z.K. Matthews was appointed to be the first black head of Adams College where the activist Albert Luthuli was already a teacher. Both of them were active in politics and Matthews was later to be the Botswana Ambassador to the United Nations and Luthuli was to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Between 1933 and 1945 Edgar Brookes was the Principal of Adams College. He worked closely with John Dube of Ohlange High School to achieve common objectives of improving the lot of native Africans. The school became one of the most important schools for black education. In 1945 the school lost Edgar Brookes, and there was a period of unrest and poor discipline. In 1947 the main building of the school burned down. A new headmaster, Jack Grant, a white academic, arrived from Trinidad in 1948 to refocus the school. The school faced legal opposition from the government as the Bantu Education Act came into force. This act required that South African schools prepare black students for secondary and manual labour. Grant and the school felt that this was unacceptable and argued that they should be allowed to become independent. However the first President and the incumbent President of the ANC were staff from the school and the authorities were adamant. They allowed the nearby Inanda Seminary School to operate outside the act, but in 1956 the school held a service to mark the end of its operation. The school was sold to the government and the head left South Africa. The important item was the school was not able to be called \\"Adams\\". What was then thought to be the end of a leading school was described by ex- staff member George C. Grant in his book, The Liquidation of Adams College. The school was renamed the Amanzimtoti Zulu Training School as the Bantu Education Act, 1953 finally came into effect. Bantu Education was a clearly divisive and paternalist racist campaign that was designed to educate black children for their lowly place in society. Academic subjects were not encouraged as this might deny the country the (black) manual labour it required. The school's name returned to \\"Adams\\" when Bantu education was abandoned. During this period the school was poorly cared for during the Apartheid period and buildings were demolished. The school requires some work to achieve its previous successes but in 2007 the school achieved a 93% Matric pass rate in line with Thulani Khumalo the heads priority of \\"academic excellence\\". Music The Lucky Stars Both what is now Ohlange High School and Adams were involved with a move to return music to its ethnic roots. The move to a traditionalist approach was backed by John Dube who was at Ohlange and Brookes who was the headmaster here. Esau Fika Mthethwea who was a teacher formed the \\"Lucky Stars\\" in 1929 as an ethnic vaudeville troupe of typically eight young teachers who had been trained at Adams. Esau died in 1933 but others took over and the Lucky Stars toured throughout the country and they nearly had a tour of Europe. Sport The \\"Shooting Stars\\" are one of the oldest football teams in the Durban area. Football was introduced by the missionary schools and the Shooting Stars were able to challenge similar teams at Ifafa, Umbumbulu and Inanda. All of these teams were well established by 1902. George Copeland Grant was on the teaching staff of Adams College where cricket had been introduced in the 1930s. As \\"Jackie\\" Grant he had captained the West Indies Cricket team for four tests before becoming a missionary teacher in 1939. When Grant arrived Ohlange High School already had an established team. Grant raised the status of the game around Durban and made Adams the centre of this new school sport. Cricket was the sport popular with the Indian immigrants to South Africa and the local Durban Indian Cricket Union dated from 1894. Today The mission station is called Adams Mission and it had a population of 600 in 2001. In 2007 Adams College was amongst several schools recognised as \\"historic schools\\". Funding of six million rand a year was earmarked for Adams, Ohlange High School, Inkamana High School, Inanda Seminary School and Vryheid Comprehensive High School to make them academies focussing on Maths, Science and Technology. Anglican Archbishop Emeritus Njongonkulu Ndungane said that they still needed funds and \\"little has been achieved since democracy\\".

Kurt Roger was born in Austria on 3 May 1895 to Viennese parents and studied in Vienna with Guido Adler, and in class with Arnold Schoenberg - though not following Schoenberg‚Äôs 12-tone system. He taught at the Vienna Conservatoire from 1923 to 1938 and his works were receiving high-profile performances (including the premiere of his String Quintet No.1 by the Ros√© String Quartet) until the Nazi Anschluss forced his emigration to the United States via London. He became an American citizen in 1945 and held teaching positions in New York and Washington DC, lecturing at several universities and giving radio talks, notably on Bruckner and Mahler. His music has received many notable performances including those by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Rafael Kubelik, the Rochester Philharmonic under Erich Leinsdorf, the New York Chamber Orchestra, the National Symphony Orchestra of Washington DC, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Northern Orchestra under Sir Charles Groves and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales under Jac van Steen. From 1948 onwards Roger was invited back to Austria on lecture tours, whose venues included the Academy of Music in Vienna and the Mozarteum in Salzburg. In 1964 he accepted a guest professorship at Queen‚Äôs University Belfast. As Roger‚Äôs wife was born in Ulster, this proved to be a happy coda to his life. In 1965 the Austrian government conferred on him the Order of Merit first class in the field of art and science. He died on 4 August 1966 on a visit to Vienna and was subsequently given a grave of honour there. In a memorial address in Vienna given by Doctor Wilhelm von Waldstein of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, Roger‚Äôs work was praised for ‚Äòits individual style, its bold but tonally-based harmonic system, its faintly Romantic quality, its strict adherence to conventional form and its unconventional tone quality in both vocal and instrumental scores.‚Äô His scores are preserved at the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna and by his family.

Early life He was the third son of David Lindsay, 9th Earl of Crawford, by his second wife, Catherine, daughter of Sir John Campbell of Lorn and Calder. He acquired the property of Balgavie and Balgavies Castle in of Forfarshire on 20 February 1584. In 1580 he became a gentleman of the bedchamber to James VI of Scotland, and also joined a group of young men who subscribed to serve the king in time of war at their own expense. Catholic convert Through the influence of the Jesuits James Gordon and William Crichton Lindsay became a convert to Catholicism; he said he was the first whom they induced to recant and openly profess the change of faith. He kept an English Jesuit in his house, and it became a rendezvous of Catholics: his chaplain for 18 months was John Ingram. It was, he stated, mainly through his example that George Gordon, 1st Marquis of Huntly, Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll, and William Douglas, 10th Earl of Angus were induced to make open confession of Catholicism. In 1589 Lindsay was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle but on 29 November was conditionally released, Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, becoming his caution that he would enter again into ward and remain there till his trial. On 19 May, for failing to appear, he was denounced as a rebel, and on 11 January 1593 he was charged, on pain of rebellion, to appear before and answer to the king and council. He failed to appear, and in 1593 the king, during a progress in the north, demolished his castle.Balgavies Castle, HES/RCAHMS Canmore. On 30 September 1594 he was again denounced as a rebel, the special charges against him being communing with conspirators against the true religion, and open avowing of papistry. In May 1594, the General Assembly having recommended that he and others should be apprehended, the king expressed his willingness to do so if possible. Lindsay went abroad, and probably visited Spain. Having returned to Scotland towards the end of 1598, Lindsay was again denounced: he agreed to enter into a conference with the ministers of the kirk, and to remain within the bounds of the presbytery of Brechin till he had satisfied the kirk regarding his religion. On 24 May 1599, Alexander Lindsay, 1st Lord Spynie became caution for him in five thousand merks; the presumption is that he made his peace with the kirk. Death Lindsay took part in the feuds of the Lindsays, and led a turbulent life. On 25 October 1605 he was murdered by his kinsman David Lindsay, Master of Crawford, between Brechin and the Place of Edzell. Works Lindsay had printed an Account of the Present State of the Catholic Religion in the Realm of Scotland in the year of our Lord one thousand five hundred and ninety-four. Family with his wife Margaret Campbell, sister of David Campbell of Kethnott, Lindsay had a son, David, who succeeded him, and a daughter, Margaret, married to Adam Menzies of Boltoquhan.

Early life  Jesse was a son of King Leon of Kakheti by his first wife Tinatin Gurieli. As a young prince, Jesse was placed by his father at the head of the Georgian auxiliaries requested by the Safavid shah Tahmasp I during his war with the Ottoman Empire (1532‚Äì55). After the conclusion of the peace, Jesse was left as a hostage in Iran, where he converted to Islam and became known as 'Isa Khan Gorji. In 1558 or 1560 he was made by Shah Tahmasp I governor of Shaki, a Muslim city close to the border of his homeland. At his investiture, he was also elevated to the rank of farzand (\\"son\\") by the Safavid king. Jesse could have been an unnamed Georgian prince reported by the English explorer Anthony Jenkinson as attending his audience with Shah Tahmasp on 20 November 1562. Alternatively, the Georgian prince is identified with Daud Khan, brother of King Simon I of Kartli.  Career in the Safavid service  In 1576 'Isa Khan became embroiled in a power struggle following the death of Shah Tahmasp. He was part of the Kazvin-based Georgian faction, including Tahmasp's Georgian widow Zahra Baji, a Shalikashvili princess, which tried to secure the succession for Tahmasp's younger son Heidar. But a rival faction, dominated by the Sunni nobles, had Heidar murdered at Kazvin and placed Ismail II on the throne. According to the 17th-century historian, Iskandar Beg Munshi, 'Isa Khan was imprisoned together with another Georgian, Simon I of Kartli, at Alamut, and was liberated with him by Shah Ismail. Munshi may have confused him with Archil, son of Bagrat, Prince of Mukhrani. On the accession of Shah Mohammed Khodabanda in 1578, 'Isa Khan was again in favor. Together with Simon and yet another Georgian, Shah Rustam the Lur, he was present at the coronation of Khodabanda and the three received the honor of kissing the shah's feet. 'Isa Khan's allegiance to the Safavids was cemented, in 1578, by his marriage to a daughter of 'Abu'l Nasir Sam Mirza, Shah Tahmasp I's half-brother and Ismail I's son, by his wife, a daughter of Husain Khan-e Shamlu. That same year, 'Isa Khan had to take flight before the Ottoman army of Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha. He then returned to Christianity and fled to his homeland, where died shortly thereafter, in 1580.  Children  Jesse had four children: * Prince Bagrat (died after 1607), a prisoner of the Safavids for twenty years (1580‚Äì1600), he thereafter departed for Russia, where he was living as Prince Pankrati Yesseyevich Gruzinsky as of 1607. * Prince Mahmad-Mirza (fl. 1580). * Prince Khosro (died after 1574). * An anonymous daughter (fl. 1605).

The Mesozoic‚ÄìCenozoic Radiation is the third major extended increase of biodiversity in the Phanerozoic, after the Cambrian Explosion and the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, which appeared to exceeded the equilibrium reached after the Ordovician radiation. Made known by its identification in marine invertebrates, this evolutionary radiation began in the Mesozoic, after the Permian extinctions, and continues to this date. This spectacular radiation affected both terrestrial and marine flora and fauna , during which the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù fauna came to replace much of the Paleozoic fauna. Notably, this radiation event was marked by the rise of angiosperms during the mid-Cretaceous, and the K-Pg extinction, which initiated the rapid increase in mammalian biodiversity. Causes and significance The exact causes of this extended increase in biodiversity are still being debated, however, the Mesozoic-Cenozoic radiation has often been related to large-scale paleogeographical changes. The fragmentation of the supercontinent Pangaea has been related to an increase in both marine and terrestrial biodiversity. The link between the fragmentation of supercontinents and biodiversity was first proposed by Valentine and Moores in 1972. They hypothesized that the isolation of terrestrial environments and the partitioning of oceanic water masses, as a result of the breaking up of Pangaea, resulted in an increase in allopatric speciation, which led to an increased biodiversity . These smaller landmasses, while individually being less diverse than a supercontinent, contain a high degree of endemic species, resulting in an overall higher biodiversity than a single landmass of equivalent size. It is therefore argued that, similarly to the Ordovician bio-diversification, the differentiation of biotas along environmental gradients caused by the fragmentation of a supercontinent, was a driving force behind the Mesozoic-Cenozoic radiation. Part of the dramatic increase in biodiversity during this time was caused by the evolutionary radiation of flowering plants, or angiosperms, during the mid-Cretaceous. Characteristics of this clade associated with reproduction have served as a key innovation for an entire clade, and led to a burst of evolution after the origin of the flower. These later diversified further and co-radiated with pollinating insects, increasing biodiversity. A third factor which played a role in the Mesozoic-Cenozoic radiation was the K-Pg extinction, which marked the end of the dinosaurs and, surprisingly, resulted in a massive increase in biodiversity of terrestrial tetrapods, which can almost entirely be attributed to the radiation of mammals. There are multiple things which could have caused this deviation from the equilibrium, one of which is that the before the K-Pg extinction an equilibrium was reached which limited biodiversity. The extinction event reorganized the fundamental ecology, on which diversity is built and maintained. After these reorganized ecosystems stabilized a new, higher, equilibrium was reached, which was maintained during the Cenozoic. Pull of the recent One effect which has to be taken into account when estimating past biodiversity levels is the pull of the recent, which describes a phenomenon in the fossil record which causes biodiversity estimates to be skewed towards modern taxa. This bias towards recent taxa is caused by a better availability of more recent fossil records. In mammals it has also been argued that the complexity of teeth, allowing for precise taxonomic identification of fragmentary fossils, increases their perceived diversity when compared to other clades at the time. The contribution of this effect to the apparent increase in biodiversity is still unclear and heavily debated.

Reher. When two estranged brothers reunite at their childhood home in the Alaskan wilderness, they and the women they love set out on a two-day hike whilst being stalked by a massive, unrelenting, and bloodthirsty grizzly bear. The film stars James Marsden, Thomas Jane, Billy Bob Thornton, Piper Perabo and Scott Glenn. The film was released on video on demand on May 19, 2015, before a limited release on June 26, 2015. Plot Deep in the Alaskan wilderness, in a place known as the Grizzly Maze, brothers Beckett and Rowan Moore encounter a massive grizzly bear, and survive. Years later, the brothers have become estranged; Beckett has become a local deputy while Rowan is an ex-convict. Coming home to Alaska, Rowan meets up with old friend Mary Cadillac, who gives him supplies and asks him to find her husband Johnny. Meanwhile, at a cabin in the deep woods, three hunters are chopping off bear paws. One hunter, Johnny, declares they leave the cabin the next day. The others, Mike and Dolly, insist they are not, saying they were given an extra week to hunt. Johnny exits the cabin and is shot. Making a run for the treeline, he manages to kill Mike while Dolly is slaughtered by the same large bear the brothers encountered years earlier. At a bar, Rowan meets a girl named Amber, both of whom later go to a motel room together. However, Rowan kicks Amber out upon discovering that Amber is a prostitute. After leaving the room, Amber is assaulted by her boyfriend/pimp, Franco. When Rowan goes out to break it up, he gets into a fight with Franco. A police car arrives and Rowan sees his older brother Beckett for the first time upon his release from prison. After arresting Rowan, Beckett and Sheriff Sully speak with Franco and he is released. Having not seen or spoken to each other in seven years, the brothers have a rocky start. Beckett asks Rowan why he has come home and they visit the family house. Beckett reveals he has married a deaf-mute wildlife photographer and conservationist named Michelle. Rowan reveals he returned to go to the Grizzly Maze and pay respects to their father. Meanwhile, out in the woods during a snowstorm, two loggers and their dog are killed by the bear. The next day Michelle is taking photos of other animals unaware she is being stalked by the bear. After the brothers visit their mother's grave, Beckett gets a radio call about the killed loggers. After dropping Rowan off, Beckett is still suspicious of Rowan's return. Rowan uses a map to find something and comes across a car buried in leaves belonging to Johnny Cadillac. While Beckett investigates the logging incident, hunter and butcher Douglas arrives and tells them that the bear that killed the loggers is far from an ordinary bear, describing it as an intelligent specimen. While Douglas offers his help to track it, Beckett, accompanied by Rowan‚Äôs ex-girlfriend Kaley, goes out to the Maze to find Rowan and Michelle. While Sully manages to shut the logging down, out in the woods, Michelle comes face to face with the bear itself, but in doing so, gets caught in a trap she set. Rowan arrives, scares off the bear, and helps Michelle. Sully visits Douglas, who once again informs him that this bear is exacting its wrath due to the poaching and logging rather than satisfying its hunger or establishing its territory. When Zoe, one of Sully's deputies, finds the abandoned car, she is killed by the bear. After Douglas agrees to hunt and kill the bear, Sully and Jerry investigate the car. Beckett and Kaley meet up with Michelle and Rowan. The two brothers then clash until Rowan reveals he came to find Johnny. Later, Michelle and Beckett look at a satellite of their tagged bears and hypothesize they are running away because of the larger bear. Rowan and Kaley catch-up, later that night, Kaley is attacked by the bear. Rowan and Beckett try to shoot it, but the bear runs off. The group packs up to leave the forest. As the bear continues to follow the group, Michelle falls into a dead moose carcass, only to find it is a kill zone full of dead moose. The group decides to make it through the Maze. Sully goes to get the group out by boat. The group encounters Douglas standing over one of Beckett and Michelle's collared bears. Initially believing he killed it, a video recording shows the collared bear was attacked by the larger bear. Going separate ways from Douglas, the group encounter the bear again, however, Kaley is injured. After the group spots the butcher cabin, they decide to leave, especially after finding Johnny dead. Douglas arrives and informs them of something shady having to do with Sully. Setting up camp, Rowan explains to Kaley, during one night in the Maze, Rowan went to Johnny to sell drugs for money. Being a guide to Johnny and his drug dealer, Rowan took the two into the Maze. During a deal, Rowan and the two are hit by state troopers. However, Rowan noticed a ranger was injured and was about to get killed by someone else, but Rowan shot that guy instead and saved the ranger. As Sully comes in on his boat, Douglas shoots the bear and Rowan and Beckett do not find him. Rowan stays behind to distract the bear while Beckett gets the girls to the boat. Rowan manages to make the bear chase him. While chasing Beckett and the girls, Michelle gets separated from them. The bear corners her, however, she is saved by Beckett and Douglas. Douglas is killed by the bear. The trio make it to the boat and are encountered by Sully, who reveals he has been taking money and let poachers loose into the Maze. The bear arrives and kills Sully. After Rowan reveals to be alive, the brothers fight the bear. Beckett pours gasoline around the bear and then sets the circle on fire, hoping to trap it. However, the bear runs through the flames and brings down the boat. Rowan saves Kaley and stabs the bear in the neck, killing it. With the bear dead, the group then recover and leave the Maze.

Directed by Jo An Djan, it starred Sofia WD, Rd Mochtar, and Mohamad Mochtar.  Plot  After falling for the false promises of the womanising nobleman Suprapto (Rd Mochtar), Wenangish (Sofia WD) commits suicide by throwing herself into the Solo River, leaving only a letter for her two children, Sriwulan (Ratna Ruthinah) and Hindrawati (Churiani). The former is raised by the family of nobleman Widagdo (Rd Dadang Ismail), while the latter is raised by a poor man named Kromo (S Waldy), eventually becoming a servant at Widagdo's home. When they are adults, Sriwulan is engaged by her adoptive father to Suprapto's son, despite loving another man. When her hitherto unknown uncle, Prawoto (Mohamad Mochtar), returns from his job in Borneo, he prevents the two from marrying, instead showing that they were both fathered by Suprapto. The marriage is cancelled, and Suprapto ‚Äì seeing a vision of Wenangish, beckoning him ‚Äì commits suicide by jumping into the river.  Production  Bengawan Solo was directed by Jo An Djan for Tan & Wong Bros., a company established by the Tan brothers, Khoen Yauw and Khoen Hian, and Wong brothers, Joshua and Othniel, in 1948. Jo had been a director for Populer Films before the Japanese occupation essentially shut down film production. The story was written by Tan Tjoei Hock and Fred Young. Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that the film was meant to draw as many tears as possible, using a formula reminiscent of most domestic productions since Terang Boelan in 1937: action, love, music, and beautiful scenery. The black-and-white film starred Sofia WD, Rd Mochtar, Mohamad Mochtar, Dadang Ismail, S Waldy, Ratna Ruthinah, Churiani, Sukarsih, Sadijah, and Komariah. The film's theme song was the 1940 composition by Gesang Martohartono of the same name, \\"Bengawan Solo\\".  Release  Bengawan Solo was released by July 1949, one of eight domestic films produced that year. The film is likely lost, as are all Indonesian films from before 1950 according to American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and film historian Misbach Yusa Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service. Two years later Young wrote another film regarding the Solo River, Ditepi Bengawan Solo. This work had a different plot and different cast. Bengawan Solo was remade in 1971, with Sofia WD, Willy Wilianto (Joshua Wong's son), and Bay Isbahi directing. In this remake, Wenangish (played by Rima Melati) died after being hit by a train.

Established by Derek Coates in 1996, the company is based at the Healthspan House on the Channel Island of Guernsey. History Healthspan Direct was founded by Derek Coates in 1996, with an initial catalogue of 10 products, eventually expanding to more than 150 products including nutritional supplements, herbal range products, skincare and cosmetic products (under the Nurture name) and veterinary supplements (as VetVits). In 2001, the company was renamed Healthspan. Lawsuit and Acquisition of Healthy Direct In 2004, the Healthspan filed a lawsuit against Healthy Direct, another health supplement supplier based in Guernsey, claiming that the company had changed its name from C.I. Nutriceuticals Ltd. in order to profit from Healthspan's brand value. The application was dismissed. In 2008, Healthspan purchased Healthy Direct in what was reported to be \\"an eight-figure deal\\", making Healthspan the UK's biggest direct supplier of nutrition supplements. Potential Sale and the LVCR In January 2011, it was reported Coates was exploring the possibility of selling Healthspan for a price of around ¬£150 million, with between 10 and 12 potential buyers submitting bids. Coates cited personal reasons related to a desire to reduce his workload, but stated that the existing management and workforce would not be affected. When four jobs were eliminated a week later, Healthspan denied that they were related to an impending sale, and were instead a result of the completed integration of Healthspan and Healthy Direct products. In 2011, the UK also announced it was ending the Low Value Consignment Relief (LVCR) loophole, which allowed retailers to avoid paying tax on goods exported from the Channel Islands to the UK that were under the value of ¬£18. Healthspan challenged the decision, citing that countries located outside the EU, including Switzerland, Cyprus, Hong Kong, the USA and China, were not affected by the ruling. The company also announced that, following its legal challenge, it would begin exploring relocating its distribution operations, although its headquarters would remain in Guernsey. In May 2011, it was announced that the company was no longer for sale, with the elimination of the LVCR being one of the main reasons, contributing to \\"too many uncertainties to maximise the value of a sale.\\" Plans to sell the company were reported to have been put on hold for \\"at least two or three years.\\" Coates also announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Healthspan in order to focus on other business interests and his personal life, although he would remain with Healthspan as the company's Group Chairman. He was replaced by former Deputy Chief Executive Graham Case, who was in turn replaced in early 2016 by Tim Pethick who left in 2018. The current CEO is Martin Talbot. Awards, Honours and Contributions In 2003, a study by Food Standards Agency of 33 cod liver oil manufacturers found that Healthspan's was the most pure. On August 30, 2011, Healthspan supported Dr. Roger Allsopp as he became the oldest person man to swim the English Channel at the age of 70 years and four months, finishing his swim in 17 hours and 51 minutes. Allsopp swam to help raise money for Hope for Guernsey and Wessex Medical Research, and Healthspan and its customers ultimately raised over ¬£400,000. Healthspan is also the sponsor of the Excellence in Marketing award at the Guernsey Awards for Achievement, given to businesses that develop and implement solid marketing strategies or campaigns for products or services that meet market needs. Healthspan Leisure In 2004, Healthspan began to invest in the tourism industry in the Channel Islands, with the purchase and refurbishment of three hotels - the Braye Beach Hotel on Alderney, and the Fermain Hotel and the 37-room La Favorita in Guernsey - under the name of Healthspan Leisure. The company made it possible for tourists to book the hotels directly through their existing call centers. The same year, it also acquired Rockhopper Airlines, which flies from and within the Channel Islands to the United Kingdom and Europe, changing the airline's name to Blue Islands. While Healthspan was exploring the possibility of a sale in 2011, Healthspan Leisure was renamed as the Vista Hotels Group. Controversies In 2008, Healthspan was criticized by Sky News who asked a panel of experts to take the Nutriprofile, the company's dietary questionnaire, entering in a healthy diet. The experts felt that the company was suggesting more supplements than were actually needed. Healthspan responded that the \\"Recommendations on diet and lifestyle in the Nutriprofile are scientifically validated.\\" Healthspan has also been criticized by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), who have made rulings against the company on several occasions for claims made about the company's products. * In 2008, a ruling was made against the company over statements made in a catalog mailing for health food supplements describing the properties of products including selenium, lutein, green tea and turmeric. The ASA ruled that the information made unsubstantiated medical claims that could discourage consumers from seeking treatment for medical conditions and that the ad must not appear again. * In 2008, a ruling was made against the company over an email advertising an omega-3 product for children called Brain Boosters. The ASA determined that the name implied that the product could dramatically enhance children's brain function, which wasn't medically substantiated, and that the ad must not appear again. * In 2009, a ruling was made against the company over an e-mail stating that \\"more people buy their vitamins and supplements from Healthspan than any other supplier in the UK.\\" The ASA determined that the calculations were based on estimates and averages for their competitors compared with their own sales figures, and that the claim was misleading, ruling that the ad must not appear again. * In 2010, a ruling was made against the company over a pair of brochures that made a series of claims about the properties of nutritional supplements including bilberry, devil's claw, black cohosh, ginseng, echinacea, ginkgo biloba, milk thistle, St. John's wort and valerian. The ASA found that the claims suggested properties of the products that were not medically substantiated, and that the ads must not appear again. * In 2011, a ruling was made against the company over an advertisement feature in the form of a magazine article entitled \\"Top 10 supplements for healthy ageing - Different supplements suit different people at different stages of their lives.\\" The article described the properties of various supplements, including lycopene, glucosamine and ginkgo biloba. Another advertisement feature in the same magazine was headed \\"7 ages of man\\", and included properties of other supplements, including saw palmetto. The ASA found that the claims suggested properties of the products that were not medically substantiated, and that the ads must not appear again. * In 2011, a complaint was made against the company regarding a mail order catalog advertising supplements, including the Healthspan products Optiflex Glucosamine, Joint Synergex, Heart Synergex and Brain Synergex. In this case, the rulings were not upheld, as it was determined that Helathspan had displayed prominent disclaimers within the brochure, stating that their products were not intended as treatments, encouraging consumers to seek medical advice where necessary. Patent In 2007, a patent was filed for a mailing carton by Healthspan Limited, with the names Derek Steven Coates, Christopher John Colmer and Ian Edwards listed as the inventors. The carton design stores flat and folds up to ensure the safe delivery of its contents.

Leased by Ukrainian Cargo Airways, the aircraft was carrying two Sukhoi Su-27 fighters for delivery to the Vietnam People's Air Force, with a planned stopover at Vladivostok. Three seconds after lift-off from Runway 14 at Irkutsk, the No.3 engine surged at approximately altitude. The aircraft continued to climb, but at a high angle of attack, disrupting airflow to No.1 and No.2 engines which also surged. Unable to continue climbing the aircraft descended until it struck houses in Mira Street, beyond the runway end, killing all 23 on board and 49 persons on the ground.  Aircraft  RA-82005, the aircraft involved in the accident The Antonov An-124-100 aircraft that crashed was first leased by Aeroflot in 1985 with her maiden flight on 30 October 1985. On 14 February 1988, ownership was transferred to the Soviet Air Forces, under the 566th Military Transport Regiment based in Seshcha, Bryansk Oblast airbase, with a tail number of CCCP-82005 (RA-82005). On the day of the accident the Antonov had accumulated 576 takeoff/landing cycles for the Russian Air Force and had flown over 1,034 hours.  Accident  On 6 December 1997, the An-124-100 RA-82005 was transporting two Su-27UBK fighters with a total weight of 40 tons en route to Vietnam. At 14:42 IKT aircraft took off from Irkutsk. However, just 3 seconds after lift-off from the runway at a height of , there was a surge in engine number 3 which caused an increase of the angular velocity of the Antonov. This resulted in a shutdown of engine number 2. 8 seconds after takeoff at the altitude of , following surge in engine number 1, the aircraft went into descent. Although the pilots had tried to maintain control over the aircraft with a single remaining functioning engine, the aircraft crashed into apartment block number 45 on Grazhdanskaya Street. The tail section of the Antonov significantly damaged block number 120 and a neighboring orphanage.  Aftermath  The crash resulted in the deaths of all of the crew on board the aircraft as well as 49 people on the ground (including 12 children from the orphanage). More than 70 families were left homeless due to the damage dealt on the two blocks by the crashed aircraft. The damage was aggravated by the ignition of tons of aviation fuel leaked during the crash.Workers amongst the wreckage  Investigation  A special commission was established to investigate the causes of the disaster. The two flight recorders, including the cockpit voice recorder, were in the center of the fire and were too badly damaged to provide meaningful data. The cause of failure of the three engines at once was officially recognized as the excessive overload of the aircraft. However, temperatures in Irkutsk were below and it was theorized that the disaster was caused by mixing cold-weather fuel with regular fuel, which was present in the tanks of An-124 after previous flight from Vietnam. That mix would have produced ice crystals clogging the fuel filters, which cut the fuel flow to the engines. In an interview with the Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper, the test pilot Alexander Akimenkov said that the accident of RA-82005 in Irkutsk could have been caused by the call of a passenger with the Chinese radiotelephone, which affected how the electronics work. Major General Boris Tumanov, former Chief of the Russian Air Force Flight Safety Service (1993‚Äì2002) and a member of the Commission of Inquiry into Air Accidents with military aircraft, told the Moskovsky Komsomolets that the accident was caused by failure of three engines as a result of the surge. In 2009, Fedor Muravchenko, General Designer of Ivchenko-Progress Design Bureau (which is the developer of aircraft engines for the An-124), gave his own version of the causes of the disaster. Based on the results of this enterprise research and experiments and his own theoretical calculations, he concluded that the disaster situation was caused by high (in excess of standard) water content in the aviation fuel (kerosene) that resulted in the ice formation and clogging the fuel filters, causing the engines to surge.I cannot be silent anymore about the Irkutsk disaster.

He is best known as the co-writer, with Ed Rush, of the song Plastic Jesus, though he went on to record three albums of solo guitar music in the 1970s and 1980s. The Folk Music Sourcebook likened his playing style to John Fahey's, and George Winston cites Cromarty as a musical influence. His music has been heard on the soundtracks of many films, including the Coen brothers' Inside Llewyn Davis. The \\"Columbia record exec\\" in Inside Llewyn Davis was named \\"Mr. Cromarty\\" in honor of Cromarty. Biography Cromarty met Ed Rush while they were students in Fresno. They first performed together at Kalisa's restaurant in Monterey, California as The Goldcoast Singers. They moved to San Francisco and, after performing in clubs there, they were invited to perform before an audience of 1,000 at the San Francisco State Folk Festival. The audience responded enthusiastically, and the duo played five encores, closing with Plastic Jesus. The recording of this performance was released in 1962 as Here They Are! The Goldcoast Singers. In 1963, Cromarty was drafted into the army. He later settled in Morro Bay, California. His first solo album of acoustic guitar music, Grassroots Guitar, was released in 1973 on his own label, Thistle Records. His next release, The Only One, was ostensibly an album of songs for children. Cromarty's third and last album, Wind in the Heather, was recorded for George Winston's Dancing Cat Records in 1984. Cromarty died on February 12, 1992. He was 50 years old. Awards In 2014, Cromarty was co-nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song for \\"Please Mr. Kennedy,\\" from Inside Llewyn Davis.

She served primarily in the Battle of the Atlantic as a convoy escort. She was named for Arvida, Quebec. Background Flower-class corvettes like Arvida serving with the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were different from earlier and more traditional sail-driven corvettes. The \\"corvette\\" designation was created by the French as a class of small warships; the Royal Navy borrowed the term for a period but discontinued its use in 1877. During the hurried preparations for war in the late 1930s, Winston Churchill reactivated the corvette class, needing a name for smaller ships used in an escort capacity, in this case based on a whaling ship design. The generic name \\"flower\\" was used to designate the class of these ships, which ‚Äì in the Royal Navy ‚Äì were named after flowering plants. Corvettes commissioned by the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War were named after communities for the most part, to better represent the people who took part in building them. This idea was put forth by Admiral Percy W. Nelles. Sponsors were commonly associated with the community for which the ship was named. Royal Navy corvettes were designed as open sea escorts, while Canadian corvettes were developed for coastal auxiliary roles which was exemplified by their minesweeping gear. Eventually the Canadian corvettes would be modified to allow them to perform better on the open seas. Construction Ordered on the 23 January 1940 from Morton Engineering and Dry Dock Co. as part of the 1939‚Äì1940 Flower-class building program, Arvida was laid down on 28 February. She was launched on 21 September 1940 and commissioned at Quebec City on 22 May 1941. During her career she had two major refits, the first between December 1942 and March 1943 at Lunenberg and Saint John. The second took place in Baltimore, Maryland from January to April 1944 where her fo'c'sle was extended. War service After workups Arvida was assigned to Sydney Force in July 1941 and escorted coastal convoys until September. In September she was reassigned to Newfoundland Command and was used as an ocean escort continuously until the end of 1943. During this time she took in three major convoy battles, ONS 92 in May 1942, ON 127 in September 1942 and SC 107 in November 1942. During ONS 127 she rescued survivors from the sinking which had been hit by two torpedoes. Convoy SC 107 was such a disaster that it contributed to Canadian escorts being pulled out as ocean escorts. While escorting convoy ON 188 in mid-June 1943, Arvida was damaged by her own detonating depth charges. She spent a week repairing in Iceland. After her second major refit she was assigned to the Western Local Escort Force as part of escort group W-7. In August of that year Arvida was reassigned to group W-2. December 1944 saw her transferred to group W-8 with whom she would remain until the end of the war. Post-war career Arvida was paid off on 14 June 1945 at Sorel, Quebec. She was sold for mercantile purposes. The ship was converted to a cargo ship in 1950 with a gross register tonnage of 1,117 tons. She was in service in 1950 as La Ceiba under a Spanish-flag. She was last registered on Lloyd's Register in 1953‚Äì1954. In 1957, she was renamed Rio Samo and reported broken up in Spain in 1987.

History The area where Bussana is situated was already inhabited in Roman times; along the Via del Mare, near the mouth of the Armea river, an archaeological dig uncovered a Roman villa. In 1797, following Napoleon's rule, which caused the fall of the Republic of Genoa, the hamlet was annexed to the Ligurian Republic, and in 1805 to the First French Empire. In 1815, it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Sardinia, and later into the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. In 1887, the original town was destroyed by an earthquake, as a result of which it was abandoned and re-founded a few kilometres downstream.

The anti-GMO activist coalition Genetically Engineered Food Alert, which detected and first reported the contamination, was critical of the FDA for not doing its job. The recall of Taco Bell-branded taco shells, manufactured by Kraft Foods and sold in supermarkets, was the most publicized of the recalls. One settlement resulted in $60 million going to Taco Bell franchisees for lost sales due to the damage to the Taco Bell brand. StarLink corn StarLink is a genetically modified maize, containing two modifications: a gene for resistance to glufosinate, and a variant of the bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) protein called Cry9C. Cry9C had not been used in a GM crop prior to StarLink, causing heightened regulatory scrutiny.Department of Soil and Crop Sciences at Colorado State University, Page last updated March 11, 2004 StarLink Corn StarLink's creator, Plant Genetic Systems, which later became Aventis CropScience during the time of the incident, had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market StarLink for use in animal feed and in the human food supply.Michael R. Taylor and Jody S. Tick of Resources for the Future, Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology. The StarLink Case: Issues for the Future However, because the Cry9C protein lingers in the digestive system before breaking down, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.\\"While EPA had no specific data to indicate that Cry9C was an allergen, the protein expressed in StarLink corn did exhibit certain characteristics (i.e. relative heat stability and extended time to digestion) that were common to known food allergens such as those found in peanuts, eggs, etc. EPA‚Äôs concern was that StarLink corn may be a human food allergen and in the absence of more definitive data, EPA has not made a decision whether or not to register the human food use.\\" Staff, EPA.

Corn-Recall Cost Could Reach Into the Hundreds of MillionsNote: Despite long searching, as of October 2013 editors could find no reliable source reporting on the actual cost of the StarLink buyback to Aventis. The task is complicated due to the sale of Aventis CropScience to Bayer in October 2001, in which Aventis agreed to retain liability for matters related to StarLink (CNN News, October 2, 2001), the subsequent merger of Sanofi and Aventis in 2004 (Sanofi company history, Official site), and the fact that Aventis and Sanofi are not US companies and their regulatory filings are not in English. In a financial regulatory filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission in March 2003, in which Aventis provided consolidated financial reporting for the years 2000-2002, Aventis described the sale of Aventis CropScience to Bayer and communicated that it had indemnified Bayer for all matters related to StarLink and other environmental liabilities and that the sale had netted Aventis ‚Ç¨4.2B, and \\"This sale resulted in a gain for Aventis of ‚Ç¨2.07 billion after provisions for indemnification related to the StarLink litigation, as well as environmental, tax, and product liability indemnification as stipulated in the Share Purchase Agreement between Aventis and Bayer.\\"(Aventis Form F-20 for calendar years 2000-2002, F-43) Therefore Aventis seems to have reserved about ‚Ç¨2.1B euros in 2003, which at that time was US$2.3B.

The Review of Economics and Statistics Aug., 2007 Vol. 89(3): 522-533 Aftermath Following the recalls, 51 people reported adverse effects to the FDA; these reports were reviewed by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to StarLink.Staff, EPA review committee. LLP Incidents The CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence the reactions these people experienced were associated with hypersensitivity to the StarLink Bt protein. The EPA was criticized by Joseph Mendelson III of the Center for Food Safety, who said \\"Clearly they didn't do anything here until they became embarrassed.\\" The EPA and Aventis were also criticized for statements at the time of the recall that indicated they had no idea such a thing would happen. \\"If there has been a violation of our licensing process, then we would have a very great concern,\\" was attributed to Stephen Johnson of the EPA. Margaret Gadsby of Aventis was quoted with her earlier statement \\"We have difficulty imagining how our corn could end up in the human food supply.\\" The registration for the StarLink varieties was voluntarily withdrawn by Aventis in October 2000.Janet E. Carpenter and Leonard P. Gianessi, US National Center for Food and Agricultural Policy. 2001. Agricultural Biotechnology: Updated Benefit Estimates, In February 2001, it was announced that the president, general counsel, and vice president of market development for Aventis CropScience (US), had been fired in response to the recall. In June 2001 Tricon Global Restaurants, 20% owners of Taco Bell at the time, announced a $60 million settlement with some of the suppliers of the supermarket taco shells; under the terms of the settlement they could not disclose the identity of suppliers. Tricon stated that the settlement would go to Taco Bell franchisees and Tricon would not receive any of it. Tricon also announced that it, along with the suppliers and franchisees, would initiate litigation against the parties responsible for StarLink entering the food chain. In September 2001, a group of about 5,000 Taco Bell franchisees and a handful of taco shell suppliers brought a class-action lawsuit against Aventis, Garst Seed Co.; Gruma Corp., (\\"the largest producer and distributor of corn flour and tortillas in the United States) and Azteca Milling seeking damages.Associated Press, September 19, 2001.

Under McRae in 2013, Canisius advanced to its first NCAA Tournament. Before becoming the head coach at Canisius, he was the head coach at Niagara from 2002‚Äì2004, and an assistant at several NCAA Division I programs from 1996‚Äì2001. McRae attended Division III Colby College in Waterville, Maine. He played four seasons of baseball and one season of ice hockey for the Mules. Coaching career =Division I assistant= After starting a club baseball team at Brock University in Ontario, Canada and coaching it for the 1995 season, McRae got his first NCAA coaching job as an assistant at Niagara. He coached there from 1996‚Äì1997, and Niagara won a MAAC North Division championship in his second season. In 1998, he was an assistant at Winthrop in Rock Hill, South Carolina, before returning to the northeast to become an assistant at Maine from 1999‚Äì2001. =Niagara= On July 3, 2001, McRae was named head coach at Niagara, where he attended graduate school. In comments on his reasons for accepting the job, McRae said, \\"One, my aspirations to become a head coach, and there aren't that many Division I openings that come up each year. Also, it's near home and it gives me a chance to see friends and family again. And my wife is from that area as well.\\" McRae was the head coach at Niagara for three seasons (2002‚Äì2004). In his first season, the team finished in 8th place in the MAAC. In both his second and third, Niagara qualified for the MAAC Tournament by finishing the regular season in the top four of the conference. Both teams won 16 conference games, then a program record. In 2003, McRae was named the MAAC Coach of the Year. =Canisius= Following the 2004 season, McRae became the head coach at Canisius. In the three seasons prior to McRae's hiring (2002‚Äì2004), Canisius's record was 12‚Äì119. In his first two seasons, Canisius finished with a sub-.500 conference winning percentage and did not qualify for the postseason. In 2007, the team finished fourth in the MAAC to qualify for the program's first MAAC Tournament since 1994. It went 0‚Äì2 in the tournament. In 2008, Canisius went 41‚Äì13 and finished tied for first in the MAAC. The team finished third at the MAAC Tournament, but got the program's first postseason win, 16‚Äì7 over Manhattan in an elimination game. McRae won his second MAAC Coach of the Year Award. After finishing second in 2009, the team won the MAAC outright in 2010. The team lost in the MAAC championship game, and McRae won his third MAAC Coach of the Year Award. Canisius qualified for the 2011 and 2012 MAAC Tournaments, and it lost in the championship round again in 2012. It started the tournament with two wins, but lost two extra- inning games to Manhattan in the championship round. In the 2013 season, McRae's team set a program record for wins by going 42‚Äì17. McRae won his 300th game as a head coach on March 16, when Canisius defeated Ohio, 16‚Äì8. The team finished tied for third in the MAAC to qualify for its seventh consecutive MAAC Tournament.

The game was released in Japan on February 24, 2016 for Microsoft Windows computers and Android devices, with an iOS release following on July 12, 2016. Online operations for the title officially ceased on September 27, 2017. Gameplay Breath of Fire 6 was an online action-based roleplaying game where players created a hero character whom they could customize in appearance, gender, and skills. Both characters and environments were presented using two-dimensional graphics, with the player traveling across several environments battling enemies and taking part in the story. They were accompanied by AI-controlled partners called \\"Fellows\\" who make up their party to help complete missions, while multiplayer missions allowed up to four players to team up together. The hero's class could be customized depending on their weapon specialization, which could branch into other, more specialized classes with more powerful abilities as they progressed. Both the player's hero and their Fellows could utilize rechargeable skills and spells which enabled the player to create timed combo chains, such as combining two spells into a larger one. Eventually players could unlock the ability to build up a meter that allows the hero to temporarily transform into a dragon form called \\"D-Trance Mode\\" and cause bigger damage to enemies. Players could connect to a hub village that allowed them to shop for items and equipment, chat and team up to accomplish co- operative missions. Like previous entries in the series, players could customize their own village as the game progresses. Plot =Characters= Players assumed the role of a male or female hero who is the sibling of Ryu (voiced by Kappei Yamaguchi), the young mayor of the town of Dragnier who goes missing following an attack by the villainous Insidia Empire. The player was assisted by a number of support characters including Nina (voiced by Ky≈çko Hikami), a descendant of a race of humans who could once transform into giant birds and who was searching the world for her lost sister. Other denizens of Dragnier and its surroundings included Gilliam (voiced by Hiroki Yasumoto), a blue-furred, wolf-like Wolba beastman who was striven to protect his forest home; Amelia (voiced by Mai Nakahara), an aloof but intelligent magic-user of the Algar sheep-horned tribe; Jubei (voiced by Hiroshi Naka), an older, weasel-like Kamaitachi beastman archer who acted as a distributor of advice; Masamune (voiced by Takehito Koyasu), a Kamaitachi swordsman and old friend of Jubei; and Peridot (voiced by Haruka Tomatsu), a traveling female musician who seemed to lack emotion but was otherwise kind. The central antagonists were members of the Insidia Empire, led by Emperor Steinberg, which intended to use the powers of the Dark Dragons to take over the world and create lasting peace through oppression. Their chief knight was Klaus (voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa), the strongest swordsman in the Empire, who was joined by Elise (voiced by Hitomi Nabatame), a woman who wielded a similar dark power, and Elena (voiced by Chiaki Takahashi), a mysterious woman with vast knowledge of the dragon clans. =Story= The game takes place 1,000 years after an apocalyptic battle between the Light and Dark Dragon clans, humans with the ability to transform into powerful dragons with immense destructive power, that ended thanks to the actions of a mysterious young man. The resulting fallout caused planet-wide gradual desertification, and over the years the people of the world have created new communities, paving the way for a peaceful new era. However, behind the scenes, the powerful Insidia Empire covertly disrupted that peace, overtaking the world slowly and dominating smaller countries, one by one. One of the lands that fell under the Empire's strength was the town of Dragnier, home to the hero and their brother, Ryu, which was razed by the Empire who destroyed all in their path. Peridot, a traveling bard who just happened to come by the ruins, found the hero in trouble and saves them. Together with the surviving citizens of their hometown, the hero and his companions needed to rebuild their lost land and strike back at the Empire while discovering the secrets of the dragon clans. Development Breath of Fire 6 was first announced in August 2013 during Capcom's Network Game Conference in Japan, where it was given a tentative release date in the region for the following year. It is the first installment in the series to not debut on a home console, and was created specifically for touch-based PCs, smart phones and tablets. Capcom designed the game as an \\"easy touch type online RPG\\" with simple controls and \\"exhilarating combat\\", and it was the first main series title released since Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter in 2002. The title supported online play as well as a cross-platform save feature that allowed players to resume their progress on separate devices.

Some narrow-gauge lines in Poland still operate as common carrier (for example the lines operated by SKPL, the Association of Local Railway Haulage), while others survive as tourist attractions. One of the finest of the latter is the narrow-gauge railway (≈ªni≈Ñska Kolej Powiatowa) running from ≈ªnin via Wenecja (Polish Venice) and famous Biskupin to GƒÖsawa in the Pa≈Çuki region. Railway traditions of Pa≈Çuki date back to July 1894 when the first two lines were opened. From 1930s until the 1960s most of 600mm gauge lines were converted to 750mm (in the meantime, after World War II Poland lost territories in the east and acquired territories in the west and north). After the war, in 1948‚Äì1949, 2984 km of local public railways were nationalized and taken over by the Polish State Railways (PKP). As a result, in 1950 there were 4146 km of PKP narrow-gauge lines, including 1293 km of 600mm gauge and 1127 km of 750mm gauge.Pokropi≈Ñski, Bogdan (2007).

There were also 951 km of forest railways and 724 km of sugar beet railways in 1950, and a number of isolated industrial railways.Pokropi≈Ñski, Bogdan (2000).

The service on narrow-gauge lines were continued by PKP until 2001. As of 2017, the only narrow-gauge line in Poland with all-year revenue passenger service is , a 3 km line linking a town of Pleszew with a mainline station located in a nearby village of Kowalew. In the past, there have also been , and lines. A recreational line 4.2 km long had been operating in the Amusement-Recreation Park in Chorz√≥w (now converted to 785), Upper Silesia .

Club career =Early career= Born in Guimar√£es, Portugal, Zahoviƒá began his career at Spanish club Valencia before moving to Portuguese club Benfica. When Zahoviƒá was twelve years old, his family returned to Slovenia, and he joined Maribor's youth selections in the 2007‚Äì08 season after his father Zlatko became a new director of football at the club. =Maribor= He made his professional debut in the final round of the 2012‚Äì13 season during a match against Aluminij when he came on as a late substitute. In the following year he spent part of the season playing on loan at the Slovenian Second League squad Ver≈æej, scoring three goals in ten matches, until being given more opportunities by Maribor's coach Ante ≈†imund≈æa during the second part of the season, eventually making 11 appearances during the 2013‚Äì14 PrvaLiga season. The 2014‚Äì15 was his breakthrough season. He made his PrvaLiga season debut in the second round when he came on as a late substitute in the 78th minute during a match against Radomlje. Maribor was struggling at home against the PrvaLiga newcomers with the score being 1‚Äì1 and less than ten minutes of regulation left. However, after only spending seven minutes on the pitch Zahoviƒá scored his first official goal for The Violets. He increased the lead three minutes later, securing all three points for the home side. He scored his third goal of the season in late August against Zavrƒç and continued his good form in early September when he netted a hat-trick for Maribor B in a match against ≈†entjur in the Slovenian Third League. A week later, in his fifth PrvaLiga appearance of the season, he scored another double in a match against Krka, becoming the league's top goalscorer with five goals after eight rounds. Only four days later, on 17 September 2014, in Maribor's first match of the 2014‚Äì15 UEFA Champions League group stage at home against Sporting CP, Zahoviƒá made his debut in UEFA competitions when he came on as a substitute for Dare Vr≈°iƒç after Nani had put Sporting ahead in the 80th minute. He then equalised in the 92nd minute. This was only the second time, first time among Europeans, since 1992 when the UEFA Champions League was established in its current format, that a father and son have both scored in the competition. His father Zlatko has scored a total of 11 goals in 32 UEFA Champions League appearances during his career. For his performances Zahoviƒá was nominated for the 2014 Golden Boy Award. He finished the 2014‚Äì15 season in second place among the club goalscorers with 15 goals in all competitions, 12 of which he has scored in the PrvaLiga. =Heerenveen= In August 2015, Zahoviƒá moved to the Eredivisie club Heerenveen and signed a three-year deal with the Dutch squad, with the possibility of a two-year extension. The transfer fee paid by Heerenveen was undisclosed, but it is believed to have been around ‚Ç¨700,000. Zahoviƒá earned eight appearances for the club in all competitions in the 2015‚Äì16 season. =Loan and return to Maribor= On 24 August 2016, Heerenveen loaned Zahoviƒá to Maribor. On 27 February 2017, it was reported that Zahoviƒá would not return to Heerenveen and would continue his career at Maribor. On 23 May 2017, he extended his contract with Maribor until 2020. On the same day, he was proclaimed as the best young footballer of the 2016‚Äì17 Slovenian PrvaLiga season. In the next season, Zahoviƒá became the top goalscorer of the PrvaLiga with 18 goals; all of them were scored in the second part of the season. International career =Youth level= His international debut came in June 2010, when he played for Slovenia U16 in a friendly match against Slovakia U16. Zahoviƒá represented Slovenia U17 at the 2012 UEFA European Under-17 Championship, where he played in all three group stage matches. He also scored the only goal for Slovenia in a 3‚Äì1 defeat against the Netherlands U17, who later won the competition. He debuted for Slovenia U21 on 2 June 2015 in a friendly match against Greece U21, where he scored one goal and helped his team in a 3‚Äì0 victory. He was capped eight times for the team during the 2017 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualifiers, and also scored one goal against Andorra U21 in the first round. =Senior team= On 23 May 2018, Zahoviƒá was included in the senior squad for a friendly match against Montenegro. He debuted on 16 October 2018 in a game against Cyprus.

Her dam Highclere won the 1000 Guineas and the Prix de Diane for the Queen in 1974 and went on to become an influential broodmare. Apart from Height of Fashion and her descendants she was also the ancestor of the Japanese champion Deep Impact. The filly was sent into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Racing career =1981: two-year-old season= Height of Fashion began her racing career in the Acomb Stakes (now a Group Three race) at York Racecourse. Racing against colts, she won from Ashenden with Count Pahlen (later to win the William Hill Futurity) in third place and was ridden by Lester Piggott, replacing the injured Willie Carson. After the race, Hern described the winner as \\"a grand filly\\" who closely resembled her dam Highclere. She was then moved up to Group Three class for the May Hill Stakes at Doncaster and was ridden to victory by the veteran Joe Mercer at odds of 4/6. Mercer was again the jockey when Height of Fashion ran next in the Hoover Fillies' Mile at Ascot Racecourse. She started at odds of 15/8 and completed an undefeated first season by beating the Waterford Candelabra Stakes winner Stratospheric. =1982: three-year-old season= Height of Fashion began her second season in the Lupe Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in May. She was hampered when Devon Air fell directly in front of her and it was only after a \\"monumental struggle\\" that she prevailed by two lengths from her stable companion Round Tower. She was considered a contender for the Oaks Stakes but bypassed the race as it was felt that she would be unsuited to the course at Epsom. The filly did not run again until July when she ran against colts and older horses in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse where she wore blinkers for the first time. She was made the 4/1 second favourite behind Ardross, an outstanding stayer who had won the last two runnings of the Ascot Gold Cup. Ridden by Willie Carson, Height of Fashion led from the start and produced a career-best performance to win by two lengths in course record time from Amyndas, with Ardross in third. Following her win at Newmarket, Height of Fashion was sold for a reported ¬£1.5 million to Hamdan Al Maktoum. Later in July, Height of Fashion ran in her first Group One race when she was the only filly to contest the thirty-second running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot. She never recovered after banging her head on exiting the starting stalls and finished seventh of the nine runners behind Kalaglow. On her final appearance on 17 August she failed to recover her previous form as she finished last behind Awaasif in Yorkshire Oaks. Stud record Height of Fashion was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Stud in Kentucky. She produced at eleven named foals: *Alwasmi (USA), bay colt, foaled 1984, sired by Northern Dancer (CAN), won G3 John Porter Stakes Newbury *Unfuwain (USA), bay colt, 1985, by Northern Dancer (CAN), won G2 Princess of Wales's Stakes, Newmarket; G3 John Porter Stakes, Newbury; G3 Chester Vase, Chester; G2 Jockey Club Stakes, Newmarket; 2nd G1 King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Ascot; *Nashwan (USA), chestnut colt, foaled 1 March 1986, by Blushing Groom (FR), won G1 2000 Guineas, Newmarket; G1 Epsom Derby, Epsom; G1 Eclipse Stakes, Sandown; G1 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Ascot; *Mukddaam (USA), bay colt, foaled 20 March 1987, by Danzig (USA), won 3 races, including LR Fred Archer Stakes, Newmarket; 2nd G2 King Edward VII Stakes, Royal Ascot; G2 Princess of Wales's Stakes, Newmarket; *Manwah (USA), chestnut filly, foaled 1 May 1988, by Lyphard (USA) - placed 4 times from 5 starts in England 1991 *Bashayer (USA), brown filly, foaled 30 January 1990, by Mr Prospector (USA), won 2 races and placed 6 times including 2nd LR Cheshire Oaks from 12 starts in England 1992-93 *Wijdan (USA), chestnut filly, foaled 4 April 1991, by Mr Prospector (USA), won 2 races and placed 3 times from 5 races in England 1993-94 *Deyajeer (USA), bay filly, 1992, by Dayjur (USA) - unraced *Sarayir (USA), bay filly, foaled 7 April 1994, by Mr Prospector (USA), won 3 races including LR Oh So Sharp Stakes, Newmarket and placed twice from 8 starts in Britain 1996-7; dam of Ghanaati (USA), won G1 1000 Guineas Stakes, Newmarket; G1 Coronation Stakes, Royal Ascot *Burhan (USA), brown colt, foaled 6 April 1995, by Riverman (USA) - unraced *Nayef (USA), bay colt, foaled 1 May 1998, by Gulch (USA), won 9 races including G1 Champion Stakes, Newmarket; G1 International Stakes, York; G1 Dubai Sheema Classic, Nad Al Sheba; G1 Prince of Wales's Stakes, Royal Ascot; G3 Rose of Lancaster Stakes, Haydock; G3 Select Stakes, Goodwood; G3 Cumberland Lodge Stakes, Ascot; LR Autumn Stakes, Ascot; placed 7 times including 2nd G1 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Ascot; 2nd G1 Eclipse Stakes, Sandown, from 20 starts in England, Ireland and Dubai 2000-2003 Height of Fashion was in foal to A P Indy when she died at Shadwell's Kentucky base on 29 July 2000.

It used to be placed in the genus Amphispiza, but recent evidence suggested it be placed in its own genus. Four populations are resident to the west: subspecies canescens breeds in south- central California, the dark nominate subspecies belli in the California Coast Ranges and part of the western slope of the Sierra Nevada south to about 29¬∞N in Baja California, the equally dark subspecies clementeae limited to San Clemente Island, and subspecies cinerea in western Baja California from 29¬∞N to 26¬∞45‚Ä≤N. The AOU now considers Bell's sparrow a separate species, formerly grouped with the sagebrush sparrow, and together previously known as the sage sparrow. Characteristics A Front-facing image of a mature Bell's Sparrow Bell's sparrow is difficult to separate in the field from the sagebrush sparrow. Both species measure about long and weigh approximately . In general, with Bell's Sparrow the malar is darker than the head while on the sagebrush it is about the same shade of darkish gray. Bell's Sparrow also has a thicker malar strip than sagebrush. The amount a streaking on the back as well as the shade of the mantle may also be used to separate the two, but this is affected by wear on the feathers. Bell's also has little or no white in the tail, but this field mark alone may not be diagnostic. Bell's sparrows are indeed often tied to sagebrush habitats, although they can also be found in brushy stands of saltbush, chamise, and other low shrubs of the arid west. The subspecies A. b. clementeae has been listed as threatened since 1977. The species' common name and binomial (belli) refer to John Graham Bell.

At its core it manipulates an n-body system (snapshot), but can also derive or compute orbits, derive images and extract tables to take to other analysis systems.  Architecture  NEMO was developed on Sun Workstations, but ports to most Unix like systems. At its core NEMO defines a series of objects (SnapShot, Orbit, Image) and associated header files and libraries to operate on them, and these mirror the data stored in a portable binary name and type tagged XML like format, dubbed structured file. The program tsf in NEMO will show the contents of such a file in a human readable way. Another feature of NEMO is that all its data can be piped from one task into the next, thus creating whole simulations in a simple Unix pipe. For example, mkplummer - 1000  snapscale - - vscale=0.5  hackcode1 - - tstop=10  snaptrim - - times=10  snapgrid - -  ccdfits - final.fits would create a 1000 particle Plummer sphere, scale the velocities down to below virial equilibrium, integrate this for 10 virial times to see it collapse, and take the particle distribution of the last snapshot and turn that into a FITS file to view in another astronomical analysis package.  History  NEMO was conceived and written by Josh Barnes, Piet Hut and Peter Teuben in 1986, at the Institute for Advanced Study, prompted by the wish to have a toolkit built around the just developed Barnes‚ÄìHut simulation. NEMO was presented at the 1994 Astronomical Data Analysis Software and Systems (ADASS) conference held in Baltimore, MD. NEMO is still in active use and development, and has been used in many publications. Peter Teuben maintains NEMO, whereas Josh Barnes maintains ZENO, a spin-off from NEMO.

Background The event was headlined by a Middleweight Championship bout between the current champion Chris Weidman and former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Lyoto Machida. The bout was originally scheduled to headline UFC 173 on May 24, 2014. However, the bout was delayed after Weidman sustained a knee injury which required a minor surgery. A light heavyweight bout between the coaches of The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 3 Chael Sonnen and Wanderlei Silva was originally scheduled for UFC 173. However, the fight was moved twice - first being on May 31, 2014 at The Ultimate Fighter: Brazil 3 Finale, and now was expected to be contested on this card. Silva was ultimately pulled from the fight entirely after he failed to submit an application to fight in the state of Nevada, as well as his refusal to undergo a random drug test and was replaced by Vitor Belfort. The bout between Sonnen and Belfort was to be contested at middleweight. However, Sonnen subsequently failed his random drug test and was removed from the bout and ultimately retired from the sport. The following day it was announced by MMA writer Kevin Iole that Belfort had also been removed from the card due to the inability of the UFC finding him a new opponent. A bout between Dan Henderson and Daniel Cormier was briefly linked to this event but was moved up to UFC 173 to bolster that event's card. Santiago Ponzinibbio was expected to face Ildemar Alc√¢ntara but was forced out of the bout with a knee injury. He was replaced by Kenny Robertson. During the event, Stefan Struve suffered a \\"near-fainting episode\\" and his bout with Matt Mitrione on the pay-per-view was canceled.

However, on February 27, the Nevada State Athletic Commission officially banned testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) from combat sports. Belfort, who was using such therapy, was forced to withdraw from the bout and stated, \\"Given the time constraints involved between now and my proposed next bout in May, I have determined not to apply for a license to fight in Nevada at this time.\\" The main event was quickly changed as former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Lyoto Machida agreed to step in to face Weidman for the title. However, on March 24, the UFC announced that Weidman had suffered a knee injury and that a new headline bout would be found. The Weidman title defense against Machida was moved to UFC 175 in July. After the announcement that Weidman/Machida bout had been moved, a Bantamweight Championship bout between Renan Bar√£o and Raphael Assun√ß√£o was targeted as the event headliner. However, Assun√ß√£o opted to decline the bout as a rib injury sustained in his last bout at UFC 170 had not healed enough to resume the proper training in advance of the event. Bar√£o instead fought T.J. Dillashaw in the main event. As a result, Dillashaw's original opponent at the event, Takeya Mizugaki, faced Francisco Rivera.

Background The event was headlined by a Featherweight Championship rematch between the current champion Jos√© Aldo, and top contender Chad Mendes. Their first fight at UFC 142, also contested in Rio de Janeiro, ended in a first round knockout victory in favor of Aldo. The headliner was originally scheduled to take place on August 2, 2014 at UFC 176. However, on July 2, Aldo pulled out of the fight citing a neck injury suffered during training. Subsequent to Aldo's injury, that event was postponed on July 8, when the UFC announced they were unable to replace the original main event fight and with less than a month before the event, the decision was made to postpone the event ‚Äì though the promotion said the numbering scheme for already scheduled pay-per-views after it, including UFC 177 in Sacramento on August 30, would remain in consecutive order. That entire fight card was re-booked for other events. Jeremy Stephens was linked to a possible bout with Lucas Martins at the event. However, Stephens' manager indicated shortly after the fight announcement was leaked that they had no intention of taking the fight. Martins faced Darren Elkins instead. Fabr√≠cio Cam√µes was originally scheduled to face Josh Shockley at the event. However, Shockley was removed from the bout citing injury and was replaced by Tony Martin. Alan Patrick was expected to face Beneil Dariush at this event. However, Patrick was forced to pull out due to a broken jaw he received during training. Dariush instead faced Carlos Diego Ferreira. During weigh ins, three fighters missed weight: Scott Jorgensen (128 lb), Fabr√≠cio Cam√µes (158 lb) and Tony Martin (157 lb). None of the three were able to make weight later, therefore all fights were changed to catchweight. Jorgensen was fined 20% of his purse, while Cam√µes and Martin, who were involved in the same fight, weren't issued a fine.

The event was expected to be headlined by a UFC Heavyweight Championship bout between the current champion Cain Velasquez and top contender Fabr√≠cio Werdum. However, on October 21, it was announced that Velasquez was forced to pull out of the bout due to an injured knee and was replaced by Mark Hunt. That also changed the originally planned title fight into an interim title bout.

It was based on a Lola T333CS, and was developed into the Spyder NF-11 in 1979. Two NF-10s were built in 1978, whilst four NF-11s were built in 1979, two of which were originally NF-10s. Both the NF-10 and NF-11 featured a 5-litre Chevrolet V8 engine. Racing history =NF-10= In 1978, Spyder converted two Lola T333CS sports prototypes into the NF-10. The NF-10 featured a naturally-aspirated 5-litre Chevrolet V8 engine, and was built for the Can-Am series. The car made its debut at the opening round of the 1978 Can-Am season, held at Road Atlanta; Newman-Freeman Racing entered Elliot Forbes-Robinson in the car, and although he was classified eleventh, he did not finish the race due to a mechanical failure. The next round, held at Charlotte Motor Speedway, saw Forbes-Robinson win the race, finishing just over 35 seconds ahead of Alan Jones in second place, who was driving a regular Lola T333CS. He finished third at Mid-Ohio, 14th at Mont-Tremblant, and sixth at Watkins Glen. Having finished seventh at Road America and fourth at Mosport, Forbes-Robinson won his second race of the season at Trois-Rivi√®res. He followed this with a 17th at Laguna Seca Raceway, and a third in the season finale at Riverside; in this latter event, Patrick Depailler drove the second NF-10, but could only finish 17th. This was the NF-10's last ever race. Forbes-Robinson finished fourth in the Driver's Championship, with 1537 points. =NF-11= In 1979, Spyder updated the NF-10 and produced the NF-11. Initially, both NF-10s were updated to the new specification; however, as the season continued, two new cars were built. Like the NF-10, it featured a 5-litre Chevrolet V8 engine, and the car was still based on the Lola T333CS. Like 1978, the Can-Am season started at Road Atlanta; this time, however, Keke Rosberg won the race in one of the Newman-Freeman Racing NF-11s, whilst Forbes-Robinson finished third. The team was almost as successful in the next race, held at Charlotte Motor Speedway; Forbes-Robinson finished second, and Rosberg came third. For Mosport, three cars were entered; Rosberg, Forbes- Robinson, and Randolph Townsend; Forbes-Robinson took another second place, whilst Rosberg and Townsend both crashed out (on lap 28 and 25 respectively) of the race. Townsend didn't race at Mid-Ohio, but Rosberg took second, and Forbes-Robinson took third. Townsend returned at Watkins-Glen, and Rosberg took his second win of the season; however, Townsend was classified 13th, with a broken oil line forcing him out after 30 laps, and Forbes-Robinson also hit trouble after 18 laps, and was classified 20th. Road America was an unsuccessful event for the team as all three drivers retired; Townsend with a blown engine after 20 laps, Rosberg with valve issues after 19 laps, and Forbes-Robinson with suspension failure after 15 laps. The next race, held at Brainerd International Raceway, saw Forbes-Robinson finish second, although Townsend was limited to ninth place due to a fuel pickup issue, and Rosberg didn't complete the first lap due to a broken rod. Forbes-Robinson repeated his 1978 victory at Trois-Rivi√®res; Rosberg finished seventh, having blown his engine, and Townsend finished 15th. Forbes-Robinson then finished second at Laguna Seca, with Howdy Holmes (replacing Townsend) finishing fourth, and Rosberg sixth, despite the latter crashing in practice. The final round of the season, held at Riverside, saw Forbes-Robinson take third, Townsend finish seventh, and Rosberg finish 14th, having crashed out after 44 laps. Forbes- Robinson finished second in the Driver's championship, with 45 points, whilst Rosberg finished fourth, with 29. Newman-Freeman Racing also won the Team's championship, with 61 points; they beat Carl A. Haas Racing Teams,Ltd. by a single point. In 1980, Newman-Freeman Racing (now known as Newman Racing) replaced the Spyder NF-11 with the Lola T530. As a result, the car did not run in the first two rounds of the series, until Golden Gate Racing entered Dan Craddock in one of the NF-11s at Mosport; he retired after 25 laps with engine failure, and was classified twelfth. He was entered in the car again at Watkins Glen, but did not attend the race. No NF-11s were entered for the fifth round of the season, but Newman Racing entered Stephen South in one of the cars at Brainerd; he crashed in practice, and was unable to race. He was entered at Trois-Rivi√®res, but crashed out in practice again; the accident was severe enough to require the amputation of his leg. This proved to be the last time an NF-11 was entered for a race.

Martinet publishing, Paris Sprawa polska w roku 1861: List z kraju. Listopad 1861. Columbia University, 18 Feb 2009. Retrieved August 3, 2013. The Polish question ( or ) was the issue, in international politics, of the existence of Poland as an independent state. Raised soon after the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, it became a question current in European and American diplomacy throughout the 19th and parts of the 20th centuries. Historian Norman Davies notes that the Polish question is the primary lens through which most histories of Europe discuss the history of Poland, and was one of the most common topics of European politics for close to two centuries. The Polish question was a major topic at all major European peace conferences: at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, at the Versailles Conference in 1919, and at the Yalta Conference and the Potsdam Conference in 1945. As Piotr Wandycz writes, \\"What to the Poles was the Polish cause, to the outside world was the Polish question.\\" History After late-18th-century partitions of Poland, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ceased to exist, divided between the Austrian Empire, the Prussian Kingdom and the Russian Empire. The erasure of Poland from the map of Europe became a key to maintaining the European balance of power over the next century. The term \\"Polish question\\" came into use shortly afterwards, as some Great Powers took interest in upsetting this status quo, hoping to benefit from the recreation of the Polish state, starting with France under Napoleon Bonaparte, who considered the Poles useful recruits in his wars with Poland's occupying powers. The term \\"Polish question\\" was heard again after the failed November Uprising of 1831, during the \\"Spring of Nations\\" in 1848‚Äì49, and again after the unsuccessful January Uprising of 1863, in which Poles and Lithuanians rebelled against the Russian Empire, trying to restore their country's independence. In the era of rising nationalism, the question of whether an independent Poland should be restored, and also what it meant to be a Pole, gained increasing notoriety. In the decades that followed, the term became less used, as no new major uprisings occurred in Poland to draw the world's attention. The issue was further assuaged by the fact that the three partitioning powers were common allies for over a century (cf. League of the Three Emperors), and their diplomacy successfully kept the issue suppressed so that no serious solution appeared in sight. Out of the three partitioning powers, for Prussia the Polish question was one of fundamental importance, as Prussia's existence was connected to the Polish state being vanquished. The Polish question resurfaced with force during World War I, when the partitioning powers fought one another, leading them to attempts to court their respective Polish citizens. In his memorandum of 20 January 1914, Russian Foreign Minister Sazonov proposed the restoration of an autonomous Kingdom of Poland with the Polish language used in schools and local administration, to which eastern Silesia, Western Galicia and eastern Poznan would be attached after the war, and on 16 August 1914 he persuaded the Tsar that Russia should seek reintegration of a unified Polish state as one of its war aims. In 1916, Germany, with the Act of 5th November, publicly promised to create the Regency Kingdom of Poland, while secretly planning to annex up to 35,000 square kilometres of its territory and ethnically cleanse up to 3 million Poles and Jews to make room for German settlers after the war. This caused the French parliament to comment that the manifesto \\"stamped the Polish question with an international character\\". Russia protested the move, as it saw its own rump Polish state, the Congress Kingdom (or Vistula Land) as the only \\"Poland\\" that mattered. Soon, however, the Russians followed the German move, and promised the Poles increased autonomy. This offer was mentioned in the United States in Woodrow Wilson's \\"Peace Without Victory\\" speech of 1917. The Polish question was temporarily solved with the restoration of Polish independence after World War I. The term became once again relevant during World War II, as after the German invasion of Poland the future of occupied Poland became once again an issue of debate between the Great Powers of the time, namely the United Kingdom, the United States and the Soviet Union. The term was also used later in the 20th century, in the 1980s during the Solidarno≈õƒá period, when opposition activists struggled to free the People's Republic of Poland from the domination of the Soviet Bloc.

Life  Vera Schwarz was born in Agram, Croatia, the daughter of Hungarian-Croatian aviation pioneer David Schwarz. She studied in Vienna with Philipp Forst√©n and gave her debut in 1908 at the Theater an der Wien. From 1908 to 1912 she was a member of the opera in Graz, and from 1911 to 1913 she sang at the Johann Strau√ü-Theater in Vienna.Karl Josef Kutsch, Leo Riemens: Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon. Bd 4. 3.

It was during this time that she taught her Vienna Staatsoper colleague Leo Slezak's daughter (and Walter Slezak's brother), Margarete. In her book Der Apfel f√§llt nicht weit vom Stamm Margarete Slezak recounts their meeting: \\"I paid Vera Schwarz a visit, and asked her to test my voice. Frau Schwarz found it would be worthwhile to train my voice, and promised me, while keeping this strictly secret from my family, to give me lessons. She lived with her mother, a delicate yet unbelievably energetic lady. Mama Schwarz missed no performance of her daughter. She sat in the middle of the parquet and influenced the audience's applause particularly loudly. While doing so she would turn left and right claiming loudly: \\"Charming, magnificent! Who is this God-gifted singer?\\". One time an acquaintance sat behind, unseen by her. He bent forward and said for everyone to overhear: \\"But, gn√§dige Frau, surely you would know that!\\"Margarete Slezak: Der Apfel f√§llt nicht weit vom Stamm. R. Piper, 1953. p. 46 (translated here from the original German) = Partnership with Richard Tauber = From 1929 to 1933 Schwarz was a member of the Metropol-Theater Berlin ensemble, returning in 1931 to 1933 to the Staatsoper Unter den Linden.

She and Tauber appeared, again under the composer's baton, in the October 1929 premiere of Das Land des L√§chelns at the Metropol Theater in Berlin. Schwarz and Tauber had first appeared together in Carmen at the Berliner Staatsoper in May 1921, and were often to appear together in operas such as Die Tote Stadt, Un Ballo in Maschera, Tosca, and Die Fledermaus at the Wiener Staatsoper.
